For new additions, see Conjectures 6.4-6.6 and 6.21-6.25",,,,"math.NT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we mainly study sums of four rational squares with certain
restrictions. Let $\mathbb Q_{\ge0}$ be the set of nonnegative rational
numbers. We establish the following four-square theorem for rational numbers:
For any $a,b,c,d\in\mathbb Q_{\ge0}$, each $r\in\mathbb Q_{\ge0}$ can be
written as $x^2+y^2+z^2+w^2$ with $x,y,z,w\in\mathbb Q_{\ge0}$ such that
$ax+by+cz+dw$ is a rational square (or a rational cube). This paper also
contains many conjectures; for example, for any positive integers $a$ and $b$
with $\gcd(a,b)=1$, we conjecture that each $r\in\mathbb Q_{\ge0}$ can be
written as $aw^4+bx^4+y^2+z^2$ with $w,x,y,z\in\mathbb Q$.

is a problem of fundamental importance. Despite the significance of the LIS
estimation problem and the amount of attention it has received, there are
important aspects of the problem that are not yet fully understood. There are
no better lower bounds for LIS estimation than the obvious bounds implied by
testing monotonicity (for adaptive or nonadaptive algorithms). In this paper,
we give the first nontrivial lower bound on the complexity of LIS estimation,
and also provide novel algorithms that complement our lower bound.
  Specifically, for every constant $\epsilon \in (0,1)$, every nonadaptive
algorithm that outputs an estimate of the length of the LIS in an array of
length $n$ to within an additive error of $\epsilon \cdot n$ has to make
$\log^{\Omega(\log (1/\epsilon))} n)$ queries. Next, we design nonadaptive LIS
estimation algorithms whose complexity decreases as the the number of distinct
values, $r$, in the array decreases. We first present a simple algorithm that
makes $\tilde{O}(r/\epsilon^3)$ queries and approximates the LIS length with an
additive error bounded by $\epsilon n$. We then use it to construct a
nonadaptive algorithm with query complexity $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{r} \cdot
\text{poly}(1/\lambda))$ that, for an array with LIS length at least $\lambda
n$, outputs a multiplicative $\Omega(\lambda)$-approximation to the LIS length.
  Finally, we describe a nonadaptive erasure-resilient tester for sortedness,
with query complexity $O(\log n)$. Our result implies that nonadaptive tolerant
testing is strictly harder than nonadaptive erasure-resilient testing for the
natural property of monotonicity.

plane are nearly parallel to each other. Uranus is also the planet with the
largest angle between the rotation axis and the direction of its magnetic
dipole (roughly $59^\circ$). Consequently, the shape and structure of its
magnetospheric tail is very different to those of all other planets in
whichever season one may consider. We propose a magnetohydrodynamic model for
the magnetic tail of Uranus at solstice time. One of the main conclusions of
the model is that all magnetic field lines forming the extended magnetic tail
follow the same qualitative evolution from the time of their emergence through
the planet's surface and the time of their late evolution after having been
stretched and twisted several times downstream of the planet. In the planetary
frame, these field lines move on magnetic surfaces that wind up to form a
tornado-shaped vortex with two foot points on the planet (one in each magnetic
hemisphere). The centre of the vortex (the eye of the tornado) is a simple
double helix with a helical pitch (along the symmetry axis $z$)
$\lambda=\tau[v_z+B_z/(\mu_0\rho)^{1/2}],$ where $\tau$ is the rotation period
of the planet, $\mu_0$ the permeability of vacuum, $\rho$ the mass density,
$v_z$ the fluid velocity, and $B_z$ the magnetic field where all quantities
have to be evaluated locally at the centre of the vortex. In summary, in the
planetary frame, the motion of a typical magnetic field of the extended Uranian
magnetic tail is a vortical motion, which asymptotically converges towards the
single double helix, regardless of the line's emergence point on the planetary
surface.

a quick inference of appropriate columns in the projection operator, which is
an essential component in synthesis but causes combinatorial explosions in

learning community especially for its principled way of comparing
distributions. In this work, we use a permutation invariant network to map
samples from probability measures into a low-dimensional space such that the
Euclidean distance between the encoded samples reflects the Wasserstein
distance between probability measures. We show that our network can generalize
to correctly compute distances between unseen densities. We also show that
these networks can learn the first and the second moments of probability
distributions.

third-party model. Specifically, the proposed method contains two main
processes, including \emph{dataset watermarking} and \emph{dataset
verification}. We adopt classical poisoning-based backdoor attacks ($e.g.$,
BadNets) for dataset watermarking, ie, generating some poisoned samples by
adding a certain trigger ($e.g.$, a local patch) onto some benign samples,
labeled with a pre-defined target class. Based on the proposed backdoor-based
watermarking, we use a hypothesis test guided method for dataset verification
based on the posterior probability generated by the suspicious third-party
model of the benign samples and their correspondingly watermarked samples
($i.e.$, images with trigger) on the target class. Experiments on some
benchmark datasets are conducted, which verify the effectiveness of the

question remains how much magnetic fields shape the star formation process or
whether gravity is largely dominating. Here, we show that for the high-mass

dominantly shaped by the gravitational contraction of the central massive gas
core where the star formation proceeds. We find that in the outer parts of the
region, the magnetic field is directed toward the gravitational center of the
region. Filamentary structures feeding the central core exhibit U-shaped
magnetic field morphologies directed toward the gravitational center as well,
again showing the gravitational drag toward the center. The inner part then
shows rotational signatures, potentially associated with an embedded disk, and
there the magnetic field morphology appears to be rotationally dominated.
Hence, our results demonstrate that for this region gravity and rotation are
dominating the dynamics and shaping the magnetic field morphology.

current of quarks along the vorticity axis while the recently found helical
vortical effect generates the helicity flow -- the projection of the quark's
polarization vector onto its momentum -- along the same axis. For massless
fermions, the helical charge corresponds to a difference in the contributions
of particles and anti-particles to the axial charge. Assuming that the spin of
light quarks transfers to the strange quarks via the vector kaon states (""the
spin-vector dominance""), we are able to describe the ratio of the (anti)hyperon
spin polarizations, obtained by the STAR group, without fitting parameters. We
also argue that the helical vortical effect dominates over the chiral vortical
effect and the chiral magnetic effect in the generation of the electric
current.

thought to be caused by a stellar merger. The remnant is composed of (1) a
large hourglass nebula of recombining gas (of 71\arcsec size), very similar to
some classical planetary and pre-planetary nebulae (PPNe), and (2) of a much
smaller and cooler inner remnant prominent in millimeter-wave emission from
molecules. We investigate the three-dimensional spatio-kinematic structure of
both components. The analysis of the hourglass structure yields a revised
distance to the object of >2.6 kpc, at least 3.7 times greater than so far
assumed. At this distance, the stellar remnant has a bolometric luminosity >12
L$_{\odot}$ and is surrounded by molecular material of total mass >0.8
M$_{\odot}$ (the latter value has a large systematic uncertainty). We also
analyzed the architecture of the inner molecular nebula using ALMA observations
of rotational emission lines obtained at subarcsecond resolution. We find that
the distribution of neutral and ionized gas in the lobes can be reproduced by
several nested and incomplete shells or jets with different velocity fields and
varying orientations. The analysis indicates that the molecular remnant was
created in several ejection episodes, possibly involving an interacting binary
system. We calculated the linear momentum ($\approx$10$^{40}$ g cm s$^{-1}$)
and kinetic energy ($\approx$10$^{47}$ erg) of the CK Vul outflows and find
them within the limits typical for classical PPNe. Given the similarities of
the CK Vul outflows to PPNe, we suggest there may CK Vul analogs among wrongly
classified PPNe with low intrinsic luminosities, especially among PPNe with
post-red-giant-branch central stars.

landscape. We investigate the structure of valleys and connecting pathways in
this landscape. The routed weight profile $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$
associates to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ the maximum scaled energy obtainable by a path

The ground state, or lowest energy state, lies at the base of the deepest
valley. In examples such as spin glasses and Gaussian polymers, there are many
valleys; the abundance of near-ground states (at the base of valleys) indicates
the phenomenon of chaos, under which the ground state alters profoundly when
the model's disorder is slightly perturbed. In this article, we compute the
critical exponent that governs the onset of chaos in a dynamic manifestation of
a canonical model in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang [KPZ] universality class, Brownian
last passage percolation [LPP]. In this model in its static form, semi-discrete
polymers advance through Brownian noise, their energy given by the integral of
the white noise encountered along their journey. A ground state is a geodesic,
of extremal energy given its endpoints. We perturb Brownian LPP by evolving the
disorder under an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck flow. We prove that, for polymers of
length $n$, a sharp phase transition marking the onset of chaos is witnessed at
the critical time $n^{-1/3}$. Indeed, the overlap between the geodesics at
times zero and $t > 0$ that travel a given distance of order $n$ will be shown
to be of order $n$ when $t\ll n^{-1/3}$; and to be of smaller order when $t\gg
n^{-1/3}$. We expect this exponent to be shared among many interface models.
The present work thus sheds light on the dynamical aspect of the KPZ class; it
builds on several recent advances. These include Chatterjee's harmonic analytic
theory [Cha14] of equivalence of superconcentration and chaos in Gaussian
spaces; a refined understanding of the static landscape geometry of Brownian
LPP developed in the companion paper [GH20]; and, underlying the latter, strong
comparison estimates of the geodesic energy profile to Brownian motion in

variety of visual apps spanning from on-demand movies and 360-degree videos to
video-conferencing and live streaming. However, robustly delivering visual
content under fluctuating networking conditions on devices of diverse
capabilities remains an open problem. In recent years, advances in the field of
deep learning on tasks such as super-resolution and image enhancement have led
to unprecedented performance in generating high-quality images from low-quality
ones, a process we refer to as neural enhancement. In this paper, we survey
state-of-the-art content delivery systems that employ neural enhancement as a
key component in achieving both fast response time and high visual quality. We
first present the deployment challenges of neural enhancement models. We then
cover systems targeting diverse use-cases and analyze their design decisions in
overcoming technical challenges. Moreover, we present promising directions
based on the latest insights from deep learning research to further boost the
quality of experience of these systems.

temperature antiferroelectric state and high temperature critical Coulomb
phase. Polarization in the system is associated with topological defects in the
form of system-spanning windings which makes it an ideal system on which to
observe topological sector fluctuations, as have been discussed in the context
of spin ice and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) systems. Here we develop
Lieb and Baxter's historic solutions of the F-model to exactly calculate
relevant properties, several apparently for the first time. We further
calculate properties not amenable to exact solution by an approximate cavity
method and by referring to established scaling results. Of particular relevance
to topological sector fluctuations are the exact results for the applied field
polarization and the ""energetic susceptibility"". The latter is a both a measure
of topological sector fluctuations and, surprisingly, in this case, a measure
of the order parameter correlation exponent. In the high temperature phase, the
temperature tunes the density of topological defects and algebraic
correlations, with the energetic susceptibility undergoing a jump to zero at
the antiferroelectric ordering temperature, analogous to the ""universal jump""
in BKT systems. We discuss how these results are relevant to experimental
systems, including to spin ice thin films and three-dimensional dipolar spin
ice and water ice, where we find that an analogous ""universal jump"" has
previously been established in numerical studies. This unexpected result
suggests a universal limit on the stability of perturbed Coulomb phases that is
independent of dimension and of the order of the transition. Experimental
results on water ice Ih are not inconsistent with this proposition. We complete
the paper by relating our results to experimental studies of artificial spin
ice arrays.

prove that the values of the cohomology fractals are normally distributed, but

recent works about the dissociation of the Y(nS) and chi_b(nP) states in the

a ""prior"" from multiple existing tasks. A common practice in meta-learning is
to perform a train-validation split (\emph{train-val method}) where the prior
adapts to the task on one split of the data, and the resulting predictor is
evaluated on another split. Despite its prevalence, the importance of the
train-validation split is not well understood either in theory or in practice,
particularly in comparison to the more direct \emph{train-train method}, which
uses all the per-task data for both training and evaluation.
  We provide a detailed theoretical study on whether and when the
train-validation split is helpful in the linear centroid meta-learning problem.
In the agnostic case, we show that the expected loss of the train-val method is
minimized at the optimal prior for meta testing, and this is not the case for
the train-train method in general without structural assumptions on the data.
In contrast, in the realizable case where the data are generated from linear
models, we show that both the train-val and train-train losses are minimized at
the optimal prior in expectation. Further, perhaps surprisingly, our main
result shows that the train-train method achieves a \emph{strictly better}
excess loss in this realizable case, even when the regularization parameter and
split ratio are optimally tuned for both methods. Our results highlight that
sample splitting may not always be preferable, especially when the data is
realizable by the model. We validate our theories by experimentally showing
that the train-train method can indeed outperform the train-val method, on both
simulations and real meta-learning tasks.

truncation and does not limit exploring all the possible modes. We slightly
modify the BigGAN architecture incorporating residual network for synthesizing
2D representations of audio signals which enables reconstructing high quality

conditional training scenario makes a trade-off between fidelity and variety

recent work we found that the scalar stars are transient due to a
non-axisymmetric instability which triggers the loss of angular momentum. We
further study the dynamical formation of SBSs using 3-dimensional
numerical-relativity simulations of the Einstein-(massive, complex)Klein-Gordon
system and of the Einstein-(complex)Proca system. We incorporate a quartic
self-interaction potential in the scalar case to gauge its effect on the
instability; we investigate (m=2) Proca stars to assess their stability; we
attempt to relate the instability of SBSs to the growth rate of azimuthal
density modes and the existence of a corotation point. We show that: the
self-interaction potential can only delay the instability in scalar SBSs; m=2
Proca stars always migrate to the stable m=1 spheroidal family; unstable m=2
Proca stars and m=1 scalar boson stars exhibit a corotation point. This
establishes a parallelism with rotating neutron stars affected by dynamical
bar-mode instabilities. We compute the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted and
investigate the detectability of the waveforms comparing the characteristic
strain of the signal with the sensitivity curves of a variety of detectors,
computing the signal-to-noise ratio. By assuming that the characteristic
damping timescale of the bar-like deformation in SBSs is only set by GWs
emission and not by viscosity (unlike in neutron stars), we find that the
post-collapse emission could be orders of magnitude more energetic than that of
the bar-mode instability itself. Our results indicate that GW observations of
SBSs might be within the reach of future experiments, offering a potential
means to establish the existence of such stars and to place tight constraints
on the mass of the bosonic particle.

conversational cues including language similarity, elicitation of laughter,
sentiment, and more, which indicate positive human feedback, and embed these in
multiple reward functions. A well-known challenge is that learning an RL policy
in an offline setting usually fails due to the lack of ability to explore and
the tendency to make over-optimistic estimates of future reward. These problems
become even harder when using RL for language models, which can easily have a
20,000 action vocabulary and many possible reward functions. We solve the
challenge by developing a novel class of offline RL algorithms. These
algorithms use KL-control to penalize divergence from a pre-trained prior
language model, and use a new strategy to make the algorithm pessimistic,
instead of optimistic, in the face of uncertainty. We test the resulting dialog

sensor position inside the fiber. In order to deduce the strain in the

application is based on the assumption that the presence of the fiber does not
impede the deformation of the matrix material in fiber direction. In fact, the
strain transfer principle implies that the strain in fiber direction inside the
fiber carries over verbatim to the strain inside the matrix material. For a
comparatively soft matrix material, however, this underlying assumption may not
be valid. To overcome this drawback, we propose to superimpose the matrix
material with a one-dimensional model of the fiber, which takes into account
its elastic properties. The finite element solution of this model yields a more
accurate prediction of the strain inside the fiber in fiber direction at low

potentially important contributors to the ultraviolet ionizing background in

determined, making it difficult to assess their role in the early ionization of
the intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we present the updated results of
our $z\sim5$ quasar survey using the Infrared Medium-deep Survey (IMS), a
near-infrared imaging survey covering an area of 85 deg$^{2}$. From our
spectroscopic observations with the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on
the Gemini-South 8 m Telescope, we discovered eight new quasars at $z\sim5$
with $-26.1\leq M_{1450} \leq -23.3$. Combining our IMS faint quasars
($M_{1450}>-27$ mag) with the brighter Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars
($M_{1450}<-27$ mag), we derive the $z\sim5$ quasar luminosity function (QLF)
without any fixed parameters down to the magnitude limit of $M_{1450}=-23$ mag.
We find that the faint-end slope of the QLF is very flat
($\alpha=-1.2^{+1.4}_{-0.6}$), with a characteristic luminosity of
$M^{*}_{1450}=-25.8^{+1.4}_{-1.1}$ mag. The number density of $z\sim5$ quasars
from the QLF gives an ionizing emissivity at 912 $\unicode{x212B}$ of
$\epsilon_{912}=(3.7$--$7.1)\times10^{23}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$
and an ionizing photon density of $\dot{n}_{\rm ion}=(3.0$--$5.7)\times10^{49}$
Mpc$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$. These results imply that quasars are responsible for only
10-20% (up to 50% even in the extreme case) of the photons required to
completely ionize the IGM at $z\sim5$, disfavoring the idea that quasars alone
could have ionized the IGM at $z\sim5$.

several areas such as GANs and domain adaptation. OT, however, is very
sensitive to outliers (samples with large noise) in the data since in its
objective function, every sample, including outliers, is weighed similarly due
to the marginal constraints. To remedy this issue, robust formulations of OT
with unbalanced marginal constraints have previously been proposed. However,
employing these methods in deep learning problems such as GANs and domain
adaptation is challenging due to the instability of their dual optimization
solvers. In this paper, we resolve these issues by deriving a
computationally-efficient dual form of the robust OT optimization that is
amenable to modern deep learning applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our formulation in two applications of GANs and domain adaptation. Our
approach can train state-of-the-art GAN models on noisy datasets corrupted with
outlier distributions. In particular, our optimization computes weights for
training samples reflecting how difficult it is for those samples to be
generated in the model. In domain adaptation, our robust OT formulation leads
to improved accuracy compared to the standard adversarial adaptation methods.

confusion of query words, the images retrieved by one query may contain
tremendous images belonging to other concepts. For example, searching `tiger
cat' on Flickr will return a dominating number of tiger images rather than the
cat images. These realistic noisy samples usually have clear visual semantic
clusters in the visual space that mislead DNNs from learning accurate semantic

indispensable. Fortunately, we find that metadata can provide extra knowledge
to discover clean web labels in a labor-free fashion, making it feasible to
automatically provide correct semantic guidance among the massive label-noisy

exposing sensitive data, but it is still possible to reverse engineer
information about a client's private data set from communicated model
parameters. Most federated learning systems therefore use differential privacy
to introduce noise to the parameters. This adds uncertainty to any attempt to
reveal private client data, but also reduces the accuracy of the shared model,
limiting the useful scale of privacy-preserving noise. A system can further
reduce the coordinating server's ability to recover private client information,
without additional accuracy loss, by also including secure multiparty
computation. An approach combining both techniques is especially relevant to
financial firms as it allows new possibilities for collaborative learning

types of systems. The first is the common, well known, cataclysmic variable
(CV) system in which a main sequence donor star transfers mass to its WD
companion via Roche-lobe overflow. The second is a detached, widely separated,
symbiotic system in which an asymptotic giant branch donor star transfers mass
to its WD companion via strong winds. For the latter we use the
Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton prescription along with orbital dynamics to calculate the
accretion rate. We use the combined stellar evolution code to follow the nova
eruptions of both simulations including changes in mass, accretion rate and
orbital features. We find that while the average accretion rate for the CV
remains fairly constant, the symbiotic system experiences distinct epochs of
high and low accretion rates. The examination of epochs for which the accretion
rates of both simulations are similar, shows that the evolutionary behaviors
are identical. We obtain that for a given WD mass, the rate that mass is

  Massively Multilingual Models",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Massively multilingual models subsuming tens or even hundreds of languages
pose great challenges to multi-task optimization. While it is a common practice
to apply a language-agnostic procedure optimizing a joint multilingual task
objective, how to properly characterize and take advantage of its underlying
problem structure for improving optimization efficiency remains under-explored.
In this paper, we attempt to peek into the black-box of multilingual
optimization through the lens of loss function geometry. We find that gradient
similarity measured along the optimization trajectory is an important signal,
which correlates well with not only language proximity but also the overall
model performance. Such observation helps us to identify a critical limitation
of existing gradient-based multi-task learning methods, and thus we derive a
simple and scalable optimization procedure, named Gradient Vaccine, which
encourages more geometrically aligned parameter updates for close tasks.
Empirically, our method obtains significant model performance gains on
multilingual machine translation and XTREME benchmark tasks for multilingual
language models. Our work reveals the importance of properly measuring and
utilizing language proximity in multilingual optimization, and has broader
implications for multi-task learning beyond multilingual modeling.

enormous output space of potential candidates. For example, finding the best
matching product from a large catalog or suggesting related search phrases on a
search engine. The size of the output space for these problems can range from
millions to billions, and can even be infinite in some applications. Moreover,
training data is often limited for the long-tail items in the output space.
Fortunately, items in the output space are often correlated thereby presenting
an opportunity to alleviate the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we propose
the Prediction for Enormous and Correlated Output Spaces (PECOS) framework, a
versatile and modular machine learning framework for solving prediction
problems for very large output spaces, and apply it to the eXtreme Multilabel
Ranking (XMR) problem: given an input instance, find and rank the most relevant
items from an enormous but fixed and finite output space. We propose a three
phase framework for PECOS: (i) in the first phase, PECOS organizes the output
space using a semantic indexing scheme, (ii) in the second phase, PECOS uses
the indexing to narrow down the output space by orders of magnitude using a
machine learned matching scheme, and (iii) in the third phase, PECOS ranks the
matched items using a final ranking scheme. The versatility and modularity of
PECOS allows for easy plug-and-play of various choices for the indexing,
matching, and ranking phases. We also develop very fast inference procedures
which allow us to perform XMR predictions in real time; for example, inference
takes less than 1 millisecond per input on the dataset with 2.8 million labels.

investigates the difference between minimal- and maximal-coordinate LQR control

comparing the basins of attraction and tracking performance of minimal- and

been shown to dramatically affect large-scale properties of active systems with
metric interactions, while the impact of quenched disorder on active systems
with metric-free interactions has remained, until now, unexplored. Here, we
show that topological flocking models recover several features of metric ones
in homogeneous media, when placed in a heterogeneous environment. In
particular, we find that order is long-ranged even in the presence of spatial
heterogeneities, and that the heterogeneous environment induces an effective
density-order coupling facilitating emergence of traveling bands, which are
observed in wide regions of parameter space. We argue that such a coupling
results from a fluctuation-induced rewiring of the topological interaction
network, strongly enhanced by the presence of spatial heterogeneities.

anomaly detection community has attempted to obtain better features using
advances in deep self-supervised feature learning. Surprisingly, a very
promising direction, using pretrained deep features, has been mostly
overlooked. In this paper, we first empirically establish the perhaps expected,

detection and segmentation methods convincingly outperforms, much more complex,
state-of-the-art methods.
  In order to obtain further performance gains in anomaly detection, we adapt
pretrained features to the target distribution. Although transfer learning
methods are well established in multi-class classification problems, the
one-class classification (OCC) setting is not as well explored. It turns out
that naive adaptation methods, which typically work well in supervised
learning, often result in catastrophic collapse (feature deterioration) and
reduce performance in OCC settings. A popular OCC method, DeepSVDD, advocates
using specialized architectures, but this limits the adaptation performance
gain. We propose two methods for combating collapse: i) a variant of early
stopping that dynamically learns the stopping iteration ii) elastic
regularization inspired by continual learning. Our method, PANDA, outperforms
the state-of-the-art in the OCC, outlier exposure and anomaly segmentation

the presence of attractive fixed points in the asymptotic radial evolution of

suggest that the large scale velocity bias is mainly driven by stellar rather
than AGN feedback. If unaccounted for, this velocity offset could possibly bias
cosmological constraints from the kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in future
cosmic microwave background (CMB) surveys. Furthermore, we examine how the
first and the second moment of the pairwise velocity are affected by both the
baryonic and the neutrino free-streaming effects for both the matter and gas

Effective Field Theory terms gives a substantial improvement, with $\sim 5\%$

biased tracers due to the freedom in the bias coefficients. The large-scale

suggest a reorganization of the theory that contains all terms relevant on
large-scales, discussing both its explicit form at one-loop and structure at
infinite-loop. This motivates a low-$k$ correction term, leading to a model
that is sub-percent accurate on large scales, albeit with the inclusion of two

signatures from the cores of H$_2$O (3.0 $\mu$m), CH$_3$OH (C-H stretching

stars in which five show a long wavelength wing due to a mixture of CO with
polar ice (CO$_r$), presumably CH$_3$OH. Two of these sight lines also show

conversion of CO into CH$_3$OH ice. Along the lines of sight most of the CO
exists in the gas phase and $\leq$15% of the CO is frozen out. However,
CH$_3$OH ice is abundant with respect to CO (~50%) and exists mainly as a
CH$_3$OH-rich CO ice layer. Only a small fraction of the lines of sight
contains CH$_3$OH ice, presumably that with the highest density. The high
conversion of CO to CH$_3$OH can explain the abundances of CH$_3$OH ice found
in later stage Class 1 low mass YSO envelopes (CH$_3$OH:CO$_r$ ~ 0.5-0.6). For
high mass YSOs and one Class 0 YSO this ratio varies significantly implying
local variations can affect the ice formation. The large CH$_3$OH ice abundance
indicates that the formation of complex organic molecules is likely during the
pre-stellar phase in cold environments without higher energy particle

the satellite and the measured distance to the satellite as the only inputs.
Using a fiducial binary population synthesis model we find that for large

star formation history is known and 2) an order of magnitude when marginalising
over different star formation history models. For smaller satellites we can
place upper limits on their stellar mass. Gravitational wave observations can
provide mass measurements for large satellites that are comparable, and in some

distinguish differences induced by the chaotic behaviour of simulations from
those genuinely due to different simulation set-up, we run each model six
times, after introducing tiny perturbations in the initial conditions. With
this method, we discuss the role of various dust-related physical processes and
the effect of a few possible approximations adopted in the literature.
  Metal depletion and dust cooling affect the evolution of the system, causing
substantial variations in its stellar, gas and dust content. We discuss
possible effects on the Spectral Energy Distribution of the significant
variations of the size distribution and chemical composition of grains, as
predicted by our simulations during the evolution of the galaxy. We compare
dust surface density, dust-to-gas ratio and small-to-big grain mass ratio as a
function of galaxy radius and gas metallicity predicted by our fiducial run
with recent observational estimates for three disc galaxies of different
masses. The general agreement is good, in particular taking into account that
we have not adjusted our model for this purpose.

This feature is clearly detected (above $5\sigma$) in the stacked luminosity
density profile obtained using the K-band magnitudes of spectroscopically
confirmed cluster members. We obtained the best-fit model by means of Bayesian
inference, which ranked models including the splashback feature as more
descriptive of the data with respect to models that do not allow for this
transition. In addition, we have assessed the impact of the cluster dynamical
state on the occurrence of the splashback feature. We exploited the extensive
multi-wavelength LoCuSS dataset to test a wide range of proxies for the cluster
formation history, finding the most significant dependence of the splashback
feature location and scale according to the presence or absence of X-ray
emitting galaxy groups in the cluster infall regions. In particular, we report
for the first time that clusters that do not show massive infalling groups
present the splashback feature at a smaller clustercentric radius $
r_{\rm{sp}}/r_{\rm{200,m}} = 1.158 \pm 0.071$ than clusters that are actively
accreting groups $r_{\rm{sp}}/r_{\rm{200,m}} = 1.291 \pm 0.062$. The difference
between these two sub-samples is significant at $4.2\sigma$, suggesting a
correlation between the properties of the cluster potential and its accretion
rate and merger history. Similarly, clusters that are classified as old and
dynamically inactive present stronger signatures of the splashback feature,
with respect to younger, more active clusters. We are directly observing how
fundamental dynamical properties of clusters reverberate across vastly
different physical scales.

presence of a small magnetic field, but may give way to field-induced phenomena
at intermediate field strengths. Sandwiched between the low-field spin liquid
physics and the high-field spin-polarized phase, the exploration of magnetic
phenomena in this intermediate regime however often remains elusive to
controlled analytical approaches. Here we numerically study such
intermediate-field magnetic phenomena for two representative Kitaev models (on
the square-octagon and decorated honeycomb lattice) that exhibit either Abelian
or non-Abelian topological order in the low-field limit. Using a combination of
exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group techniques, as
well as linear spin-wave theory, we establish the generic features of Kitaev
spin liquids in an external magnetic field. While ferromagnetic models
typically exhibit a direct transition to the polarized state at a relatively
low field strength, antiferromagnetic couplings not only substantially
stabilizes the topological spin liquid phase, but generically lead to the
emergence of a distinct field-induced intermediate regime, separated by a
crossover from the high-field polarized regime. Our results suggest that, for
most lattice geometries, this regime generically exhibits significant spin
canting, antiferromagnetic spin-spin correlations, and an extended proximate
spin liquid regime at finite temperatures. Notably, we identify a symmetry
obstruction in the original honeycomb Kitaev model that prevents, at least for
certain field directions, the formation of such canted magnetism without
breaking symmetries -- consistent with the recent numerical observation of an
extended gapless spin liquid in this case.

dwarf galaxies. These systems were identified in the Local Volume for the first
time more than thirty years ago. We study these systems in the cosmological
framework of the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. We consider
the Small MultiDark Planck simulation and populate its dark matter haloes by
applying the semi-analytic model of galaxy formation SAG. We identify galaxy
systems using a friends of friends algorithm with a linking length equal to
$b=0.4 \,{\rm Mpc}\,h^{-1}$, to reproduce the size of dwarf galaxy associations
detected in the Local Volume. Our samples of dwarf systems are built up
removing those systems that have one (or more) galaxies with stellar mass
larger than a maximum threshold $M_{\rm max}$. We analyse three different
samples defined by ${\rm log}_{10}(M_{\rm max}[{\rm M}_{\odot}\,h^{-1}]) = 8.5,
9.0$ and $9.5$. On average, our systems have typical sizes of $\sim 0.2\,{\rm
Mpc}\,h^{-1}$, velocity dispersion of $\sim 30 {\rm km\,s^{-1}} $ and estimated
total mass of $\sim 10^{11} {\rm M}_{\odot}\,h^{-1}$. Such large typical sizes
suggest that individual members of a given dwarf association reside in
different dark matter haloes and are generally not substructures of any other
halo. Indeed, in more than 90 per cent of our dwarf systems their individual
members inhabit different dark matter haloes, while only in the remaining 10
per cent members do reside in the same halo. Our results indicate that the
$\Lambda$CDM model can naturally reproduce the existence and properties of
dwarf galaxies associations without much difficulty.

simultaneously avoid flavor-changing-neutral-currents at tree-level. We
explicitly construct two models called Type-A and B. There, either the top
quark alone or all third generation fermions couple to the doublet with the
larger VEV. The other fermions acquire their masses through the small VEV of
the other doublet. Thus, more natural values for the Yukawa couplings can be
obtained. The main differences between these models and conventional ones are
studied including a discussion of both their structure and phenomenological
consequences. In particular, as distinctive deviations for the Yukawa couplings
of the light fermions are predicted we discuss possible tests at the LHC based
on searches for $h\to J/\Psi + \gamma$, $h\to\mu\mu$, and heavy scalar
resonances decaying to muon pairs. We find that for a wide region of parameter

proposed types and the conventional ones.

where a subset of parameters -- focusing on $\Omega_m$ -- are split into
versions associated with structure growth (e.g. $\Omega_m^{\rm grow}$) and
expansion history (e.g. $\Omega_m^{\rm geo}$). Once the parameters have been
specified for the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, which includes general
relativity as a theory of gravity, it uniquely predicts the evolution of both
geometry (distances) and the growth of structure over cosmic time. Any
inconsistency between measurements of geometry and growth could therefore
indicate a breakdown of that model. Our growth-geometry split approach
therefore serves as both a (largely) model-independent test for
beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics, and as a means to characterize how DES observables
provide cosmological information. We analyze the same multi-probe DES data as
arXiv:1811.02375 : DES Year 1 (Y1) galaxy clustering and weak lensing, which
are sensitive to both growth and geometry, as well as Y1 BAO and Y3 supernovae,
which probe geometry. We additionally include external geometric information
from BOSS DR12 BAO and a compressed Planck 2015 likelihood, and external growth
information from BOSS DR12 RSD. We find no significant disagreement with
$\Omega_m^{\rm grow}=\Omega_m^{\rm geo}$. When DES and external data are
analyzed separately, degeneracies with neutrino mass and intrinsic alignments
limit our ability to measure $\Omega_m^{\rm grow}$, but combining DES with
external data allows us to constrain both growth and geometric quantities. We
also consider a parameterization where we split both $\Omega_m$ and $w$, but
find that even our most constraining data combination is unable to separately
constrain $\Omega_m^{\rm grow}$ and $w^{\rm grow}$. Relative to $\Lambda$CDM,
splitting growth and geometry weakens bounds on $\sigma_8$ but does not alter
constraints on $h$.

from a large N-body simulation, through setting up LSST-like observations

with Rubin's LSST Science Pipelines. This last step ensures that we generate

the LSST DESC working groups can use the dataset to develop a range of DESC

the origin of DF2's peculiar GC system. Using the GC mass function, the model
constrains the star-forming conditions in the galaxy during the formation of
its GCs, $\sim9~\rm{Gyr}$ ago. We predict that the GCs formed in an environment
with very high gas surface density, $\Sigma_{\rm ISM} \gtrsim 10^3 M_{\odot}
\rm{pc}^{-2}$, and strong centrifugal support, $\Omega \gtrsim
0.7~\rm{Myr}^{-1}$, similar to nearby circum-nuclear starbursts and the central
region of the Milky Way. These extreme conditions required to form the observed
GC population imply a very high cluster formation efficiency of $\gtrsim 78$
per cent, and contrast strongly with the current diffuse nature of the galaxy.
Since a nuclear starburst would lead to the rapid in-spiral of the GCs and is
ruled out by the absence of a nuclear star cluster, we propose that the GCs
plausibly formed during a major merger at $z\sim1.3$. The merger remnant must
have undergone significant expansion of its stellar (and perhaps also its dark
matter) component to reach its low present surface brightness, leading to the
interesting possibility that it was the formation of DF2's extreme GC
population that caused it to become a UDG. If true, this strong structural
evolution would have important implications for understanding the origins of

the effects of a disformal coupling of the scalar on the two-body dynamics and
introduce a resummation technique. This new Non-Relativistic Scalar-Tensor

the spin parameter of near-extremal black holes (for $a \gtrsim 0.9999$) with
extraordinary precision, $\sim$ 3-4 orders of magnitude better than for
moderate spins, $a \sim 0.9$. Such spin measurements would be one of the
tightest measurements of an astrophysical parameter within a gravitational wave
context. Our results are primarily based off a Fisher matrix analysis, but are
verified using both frequentest and Bayesian techniques. We present analytical
arguments that explain these high spin precision measurements. The high
precision arises from the spin dependence of the radial inspiral evolution,
which is dominated by geodesic properties of the secondary orbit, rather than
radiation reaction. High precision measurements are only possible if we observe
the exponential damping of the signal that is characteristic of the
near-horizon regime of near-extremal inspirals. Our results demonstrate that,
if such black holes exist, LISA would be able to successfully identify rapidly
rotating black holes up to $a = 1-10^{-9}$ , far past the Thorne limit of $a =

of quasars as point sources with zero proper motions in the {\it Gaia} data
release 2 (DR2). We have built a complete candidate sample including 104
Gaia-DR2 point sources brighter than $G<20$ mag within one degree of the north
Galactic pole (NGP), all with proper motions consistent with zero within
2$\sigma$ uncertainty. In addition to pre-existing spectra, we have secured
long-slit spectroscopy of all the remaining candidates and find that all 104
stationary point sources in the field can be classified as either quasars (63)
or stars (41). The selection efficiency of the zero-proper-motion criterion at
high Galactic latitudes is thus $\approx 60\%$. Based on this complete quasar
sample we examine the basic properties of the underlying quasar population
within the imposed limiting magnitude. We find that the surface density of
quasars is 20 deg$^{-2}$, the redshift distribution peaks at $z\sim1.5$, and
that only eight systems ($13^{+5}_{-3}\%$) show significant dust reddening. We
then explore the selection efficiency of commonly used optical, near- and
mid-infrared quasar identification techniques and find that they are all
complete at the $85-90\%$ level compared to the astrometric selection. Finally,
we discuss how the astrometric selection can be improved to an efficiency of
$\approx70\%$ by including an additional cut requiring parallaxes of the
candidates to be consistent with zero within 2$\sigma$. The selection
efficiency will further increase with the release of future, more sensitive
astrometric measurement from the Gaia mission. This type of selection, purely
based on the astrometry of the quasar candidates, is unbiased in terms of
colours and emission mechanisms of the quasars and thus provides the most
complete census of the quasar population within the limiting magnitude of Gaia.

half-filled Hubbard model on a square lattice at small interaction. Our results
establish that, in this regime, nonlocal vertex corrections play an important
role in the formation of the pseudogap. Namely, in comparison to the simpler
ladder approximation, these additional vertex corrections included in the
parquet equations enhance the coupling of spin fluctuations with the
quasiparticles. The pseudogap thus opens already at a higher temperature, in
quantitative agreement with the numerically exact diagrammatic Monte Carlo. The
representation of the parquet diagrams in terms of boson exchange facilitates
large lattice sizes and gives rise to an unbiased fluctuation diagnostic of the
self-energy, which does not rely on the Fierz ambiguity. The fluctuation
diagnostic implies that nodal and antinodal fermions are affected equally by
spin fluctuations with the exact commensurate nesting vector $(\pi,\pi)$.
However, the antinode couples more efficiently to incommensurate fluctuations
than the node, leading to the nodal/antinodal dichotomy. We corroborate this
finding in terms of a spin-fermion-like calculation.

Results show that traditional active learning strategies significantly

able to significantly overcome simple uncertainty sampling techniques. Our
findings illustrate three important points: 1) active learning strategies are a
powerful tool to optimize the label-acquisition task in astronomy, 2) for

our protocol using an example of two-dimensional time-reversal odd-parity

by breaking the direction of dominance and allowing reversed invasion with a
smaller probability. While this alteration has no particular consequence on the
behavior within the framework of Lotka-Volterra models, the reactions of
May-Leonard systems are highly different. In the latter case, not just the
mentioned ""survival of the weakest"" effect vanishes, but also the coexistence
of the loop cannot be maintained if the reversed invasion exceeds a threshold
value. Interestingly, the extinction to a uniform state is characterized by a
non-monotonous probability function. While the presence of reversed invasion
does not fully diminish the evolutionary advantage of the original predator
species, but this weakened effective invasion rate helps the related prey
species to collect larger initial area for the final battle between them. The
competition of these processes determines the likelihood in which uniform state
the system terminates.

The development of new commonsense knowledge graphs (CSKG) has been central to

remain questions about the quality and coverage of these resources due to the
massive scale required to comprehensively encompass general commonsense

  In this work, we posit that manually constructed CSKGs will never achieve the

be learned from them.
  With this new goal, we propose ATOMIC 2020, a new CSKG of general-purpose

leading CSKGs, performing the first large-scale pairwise study of commonsense

training knowledge models that can generate accurate, representative knowledge
for new, unseen entities and events. Finally, through human evaluation, we show
that the few-shot performance of GPT-3 (175B parameters), while impressive,

  low-mass protostars","Accepted on A&A on 09 Oct 2020","A&A 644, A29 (2020)","10.1051/0004-6361/202039303",,"astro-ph.GA astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context. The nitrogen isotopic ratio is considered an important diagnostic
tool of the star formation process, and $N_2H^+$ is particularly important
because it is directly linked to molecular nitrogen $N_2$. However, theoretical
models still lack to provide an exhaustive explanation for the observed
$^{14}N/^{15}N$ values.
  Aims. Recent theoretical works suggest that the $^{14}N/^{15}N$ behaviour is
dominated by two competing reactions that destroy $ N_2H^+$: dissociative
recombination and reaction with CO. When CO is depleted from the gas phase, if
$N_2H^+$ recombination rate is lower with respect to the $N^{15}NH^+$ one, the
rarer isotopologue is destroyed faster. This implies that the $N_2H^+$ isotopic
ratio in protostars should be lower than the one in prestellar cores, and
consistent with the elemental value of ~440. We aim to test this hypothesis,
producing the first sample of $N_2H^+ / N^{15}NH^+$ measurements in low mass
protostars.
  Methods. We observe the $N_2H^+$ and $N^{15}NH^+$ lowest rotational
transition towards six young stellar objects in Perseus and Taurus molecular
clouds. We model the spectra with a custom python code using a constant
$T_{ex}$ approach to fit the observations. We discuss in appendix the validity
of this hypothesis. The derived column densities are used to compute the
nitrogen isotopic ratio.
  Results. Our analysis yields an average of $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N|_{pro} = 420
\pm 15$ in the protostellar sample. This is consistent with the protosolar
value of 440, and significantly lower than the average value previously
obtained in a sample of prestellar objects. Conclusions. Our results are in
agreement with the hypothesis that, when CO is depleted from the gas-phase,
dissociative recombinations with free electrons destroy $N^{15}NH^+$ faster
than $N_2H^+$, leading to high isotopic ratios in prestellar cores, where CO is
frozen on dust grains.

algorithm based on the error-state extended Kalman filtering framework (ESEKF).
Major benefits of this method are its versatility, being applicable to
different robotic systems without accurately modeling the robots' specific
dynamics, and ability to estimate the robot's (angular) acceleration, jerk, or
higher-order dynamic states with low delay. Mathematical analysis with
numerical simulations are presented to show the properties of the statistical
model-based estimation framework and to reveal its connection to existing
low-pass filters. Furthermore, a new paradigm is developed for robots
observability analysis by developing Lie derivatives and associated partial
differentiation directly on manifolds. It is shown that this new paradigm is
much simpler and more natural than existing methods based on quaternion
parameterizations. It is also scalable to high dimensional systems. A novel
\textbf{\textit{thin}} set concept is introduced to characterize the
unobservable subset of the system states, providing the theoretical foundation
to observability analysis of robotic systems operating on manifolds and in high

extrinsic calibration (both POS-IMU and IMU-IMU) on a quadrotor UAV, a handheld

devices, while keeping the training data localized. This form of collaborative
learning exposes new tradeoffs among model convergence speed, model accuracy,
balance across clients, and communication cost, with new challenges including:
(1) straggler problem, where the clients lag due to data or (computing and
network) resource heterogeneity, and (2) communication bottleneck, where a
large number of clients communicate their local updates to a central server and
bottleneck the server. Many existing FL methods focus on optimizing along only
one dimension of the tradeoff space. Existing solutions use asynchronous model
updating or tiering-based synchronous mechanisms to tackle the straggler
problem. However, the asynchronous methods can easily create a network
communication bottleneck, while tiering may introduce biases as tiering favors
faster tiers with shorter response latencies. To address these issues, we
present FedAT, a novel Federated learning method with Asynchronous Tiers under
Non-i.i.d. data. FedAT synergistically combines synchronous intra-tier training
and asynchronous cross-tier training. By bridging the synchronous and
asynchronous training through tiering, FedAT minimizes the straggler effect
with improved convergence speed and test accuracy. FedAT uses a
straggler-aware, weighted aggregation heuristic to steer and balance the
training for further accuracy improvement. FedAT compresses the uplink and
downlink communications using an efficient, polyline-encoding-based compression
algorithm, therefore minimizing the communication cost. Results show that FedAT
improves the prediction performance by up to 21.09%, and reduces the
communication cost by up to 8.5x, compared to state-of-the-art FL methods.

with non-trivial centers in the code subalgebra. Specifically, we use the
Bacon-Shor codes and perfect tensors to construct a gauge code (or a stabilizer
code with gauge-fixing), which we call the holographic hybrid code. This code
admits a local log-depth encoding/decoding circuit, and can be represented as a
holographic tensor network which satisfies an analog of the Ryu-Takayanagi
formula and reproduces features of the sub-region duality. We then construct
approximate versions of the holographic hybrid codes by ""skewing"" the code
subspace, where the size of skewing is analogous to the size of the
gravitational constant in holography. These approximate hybrid codes are not
necessarily stabilizer codes, but they can be expressed as the superposition of
holographic tensor networks that are stabilizer codes. For such constructions,
different logical states, representing different bulk matter content, can
""back-react"" on the emergent geometry, resembling a key feature of gravity. The
locality of the bulk degrees of freedom becomes subspace-dependent and
approximate. Such subspace-dependence is manifest from the point of view of the
""entanglement wedge"" and bulk operator reconstruction from the boundary. Exact
complementary error correction breaks down for certain bipartition of the
boundary degrees of freedom; however, a limited, state-dependent form is
preserved for particular subspaces. We also construct an example where the
connected two-point correlation functions can have a power-law decay. Coupled
with known constraints from holography, a weakly back-reacting bulk also forces
these skewed tensor network models to the ""large $N$ limit"" where they are
built by concatenating a large $N$ number of copies.

the disk when they encounter transient spiral arms that are naturally generated
during the process of disk formation. We argue that a large movement of the
solar system from the innermost disk over its lifetime is inferred from a
comparison of the solar composition with those of solar twins within the
Galactic chemical evolution framework. The implied metal-rich environment at
the Sun's birthplace and formation time is supported by measured silicon
isotopic ratios in presolar silicon carbide grains. We perform numerical
simulations of the dynamical evolution of disk stars in a Milky Way-like galaxy
to identify the lifetime trajectory of the solar system. We find that a solar
system born in the proximity of the Galactic bulge could travel to the current
locus by the effect of radial migration induced by several major encounters
with spiral arms. The frequent feature we identify is the repeated passages of
stars inside the same spiral arm owing to the wobble of stars traveling in and
out of the spiral arms. We predict that such episodes are evidenced in the
Earth's geological history as snowball Earth and that their occurrence times
are within our prediction. In particular, the stellar motion that vertically
oscillates during passages through spiral arms occasionally leads to a split
into two discrete passage episodes with an interval of several tens of Myr,
implying two relevant snowball Earth events that occurred in rapid succession
(~7.2 and 6.5 hundred Myr ago).

  (Technical Report)",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Low-latency online services have strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs) that
require datacenter systems to support high throughput at microsecond-scale tail
latency. Dataplane operating systems have been designed to scale up multi-core
servers with minimal overhead for such SLOs. However, as application demands
continue to increase, scaling up is not enough, and serving larger demands
requires these systems to scale out to multiple servers in a rack. We present
RackSched, the first rack-level microsecond-scale scheduler that provides the
abstraction of a rack-scale computer (i.e., a huge server with hundreds to
thousands of cores) to an external service with network-system co-design. The
core of RackSched is a two-layer scheduling framework that integrates
inter-server scheduling in the top-of-rack (ToR) switch with intra-server
scheduling in each server. We use a combination of analytical results and
simulations to show that it provides near-optimal performance as centralized
scheduling policies, and is robust for both low-dispersion and high-dispersion
workloads. We design a custom switch data plane for the inter-server scheduler,
which realizes power-of-k-choices, ensures request affinity, and tracks server
loads accurately and efficiently. We implement a RackSched prototype on a
cluster of commodity servers connected by a Barefoot Tofino switch. End-to-end
experiments on a twelve-server testbed show that RackSched improves the
throughput by up to 1.44x, and scales out the throughput near linearly, while
maintaining the same tail latency as one server until the system is saturated.

interpreted as partial or total occultation of the stellar radiation by dust
surrounding the star.
  In this work, we analyze the amplitude of the optical light curve of V715
Per, located in the young star forming region IC 348. Observations gathered
over the years suggest that the light curve can be explained by dust extinction
events.
  In our model, the dust is distributed inside the magnetosphere according to
the strength of the stellar magnetic field. The dust distribution is modulated
by the vertical component of the field, whose axis is misaligned with respect
to the rotational axis. We include a model for the evaporation of the dust
reaching the magnetosphere in order to consistently calculate its distribution.
  For V715 Per, there is dust in the optically thick warp at the disk
truncation radius. We suggest that the optical light curve is explained by
extinction caused by dust reaching inside the magnetosphere. The dust
distribution is optically thin and due to the high temperature and low density,
it cannot survive for a long time. However because the grains rapidly move
towards the stellar surface and the sublimation is not instantaneous, there is
a layer of dust covering the magnetosphere responsible for the extinction.
  Dust surviving the harsh conditions of the magnetospheric accretion flow may
be responsible for some of the dipper light curves.

the upcoming radio telescope SKA, using photon signals from the Inverse Compton
(IC) effect within a galactic halo. Pair-annihilation or decay of MeV DM
particles (into $e^+ e^-$ pairs) or Hawking radiation from a population of PBHs
generates mildly relativistic $e^{\pm}$ which can lead to radio signals through
the IC scattering on low energy cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. We
study the ability of SKA to detect such signals coming from nearby ultra-faint
dwarf galaxies Segue I and Ursa Major II as well as the globular cluster
$\omega$-cen and the Coma cluster. We find that with $\sim 100$ hours of
observation, the SKA improves the Planck constraints on the DM
annihilation/decay rate and the PBH abundance for masses in the range $\sim 1$
to few tens of MeV and above $10^{15}$ to $10^{17}$ g, respectively.
Importantly, the SKA limits are independent of the assumed magnetic fields
within the galaxies. Previously allowed regions of diffusion parameters of MeV
electrons inside a dwarf galaxy that give rise to observable signals at the SKA
are also excluded. For objects like dwarf galaxies, predicted SKA constraints
depend on both the DM and diffusion parameters. Independent observations in
different frequency bands, e.g., radio and $\gamma$-ray frequencies, may break
this degeneracy and thus enable one to constrain the combined parameter space
of DM and diffusion. However, the constraints are independent of diffusion
parameters for galaxy clusters such as Coma.

uses a high-order areal quadrature over the aperture, then exploits a single 2D
nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) to evaluate rapidly at target points
(of order $10^7$ such points per second, independent of aperture complexity).
It thus combines the high accuracy of edge integral methods with the high speed
of Fourier methods. Its cost is ${\mathcal O}(n^2 \log n)$, where $n$ is the
linear resolution required in source and target planes, to be compared with
${\mathcal O}(n^3)$ for edge integral methods. In tests with several aperture

single-layer toric code in terms of the conserved quantities of the Ising toric
code bilayer. The two topological phases are further characterized by the
topological entanglement entropy which serves as a non-local order parameter.

latter builds on an appropriate representation of the entropy production rates,
which is based on structural information being obtained from a more refined

relations obtained for the one-sided bulk-interface species transfer rates are

artificial paraphrasing in order to generate a large set of training data for
further classical, attention, and language transformation-based learning
approaches for Natural Language Processing. Human beings are asked to
paraphrase commands and questions for task identification for further execution
of a machine. The commands and questions are split into training and validation
sets. A total of 483 responses were recorded. Secondly, the training set is
paraphrased by the T5 model in order to augment it with further data. Seven
state-of-the-art transformer-based text classification algorithms (BERT,
DistilBERT, RoBERTa, DistilRoBERTa, XLM, XLM-RoBERTa, and XLNet) are
benchmarked for both sets after fine-tuning on the training data for two
epochs. We find that all models are improved when training data is augmented by
the T5 model, with an average increase of classification accuracy by 4.01%. The
best result was the RoBERTa model trained on T5 augmented data which achieved
98.96% classification accuracy. Finally, we found that an ensemble of the five
best-performing transformer models via Logistic Regression of output label
predictions led to an accuracy of 99.59% on the dataset of human responses. A
highly-performing model allows the intelligent system to interpret human
commands at the social-interaction level through a chatbot-like interface (e.g.
""Robot, can we have a conversation?"") and allows for better accessibility to AI

realize optimal material architectures. This procedure is often used to
automate the design of devices involving flow through porous media, such as
micro-fluidic devices. TopOpt offers material layouts that control the flow of
fluids through porous materials, providing desired functionalities. Many prior
studies in this application area have used Darcy equations for primal analysis
and the minimum power theorem (MPT) to drive the optimization problem. But both
these choices (Darcy equations and MPT) are restrictive and not valid for
general working conditions of modern devices. Being simple and linear, Darcy
equations are often used to model flow of fluids through porous media. However,
two inherent assumptions of the Darcy model are: the viscosity of a fluid is a
constant, and inertial effects are negligible. There is irrefutable
experimental evidence that viscosity of a fluid, especially organic liquids,
depends on the pressure. Given the typical small pore-sizes, inertial effects
are dominant in micro-fluidic devices. Next, MPT is not a general principle and
is not valid for (nonlinear) models that relax the assumptions of the Darcy
model. This paper aims to overcome the mentioned deficiencies by presenting a
general strategy for using TopOpt. First, we will consider nonlinear models
that take into account the pressure-dependent viscosity and inertial effects,
and study the effect of these nonlinearities on the optimal material layouts
under TopOpt. Second, we will explore the rate of mechanical dissipation, valid
even for nonlinear models, as an alternative for the objective function. Third,
we will present analytical solutions of optimal designs for canonical problems;
these solutions not only possess research and pedagogical values but also
facilitate verification of computer implementations.

of the modern Italian started in Tuscany around the 14th century, and it is
mainly attributed to the works of Dante Alighieri, Francesco Petrarca and
Giovanni Boccaccio, who are among the most acclaimed authors of the medieval

dialects, which are often loosely related to each other, due to the past
fragmentation of the territory. Italian has absorbed influences from many of
these dialects, as also from other languages due to dominion of portions of the
country by other nations, such as Spain and France. In this work we present
Vulgaris, a project aimed at studying a corpus of Italian textual resources
from authors of different regions, ranging in a time period between 1200 and
1600. Each composition is associated to its author, and authors are also
grouped in families, i.e. sharing similar stylistic/chronological
characteristics. Hence, the dataset is not only a valuable resource for
studying the diachronic evolution of Italian and the differences between its

absorption in a number of radio galaxies and are considered a signature of AGN
feedback. These outflows on kpc-scales have not been investigated in great
detail as they require high-angular resolution observations to be spatially
resolved. In some radio AGN, they are likely the result of the radio jets
interacting with the interstellar medium. We have used a global VLBI array to
map the HI outflow in a small sample of young and restarted radio galaxies
which we previously observed with the VLA and the WSRT at lower resolution.
Here, we report on our findings for 4C52.37 and 3C293 and we discuss the sample
including the previously published sources 4C12.50 and 3C236. For 4C52.37, we
present the first-ever HI VLBI observation which recovered the majority of the
outflowing HI gas in form of clouds towards the central 100pc of the AGN. The
clouds are blue-shifted by up to 600km/s with respect to the systemic velocity.
3C293 is largely resolved out in our VLBI observation, but we detect, towards
the VLBI core, some outflowing HI gas blueshifted with respect to the systemic
velocity by up to 300km/s. We also find indications that the HI outflow is
extended. Overall, we find that the fraction of HI gas recovered by our VLBI
observation varies significantly within our sample. In all cases we find
evidence for a clumpy structure of both the outflowing and the quiescent gas,
consistent with predictions from numerical simulations. The outflows include at
least a component of relatively compact clouds (10^4-10^5Msun) often observed
already at a few tens of pc (in projection) from the core. We also find
indications that the HI outflow might have a diffuse component, especially in
larger sources. Our results support the interpretation that we observe these
AGNs at different stages in the evolution of the jet-ISM interaction.

within an input graph $G$. This is one of the most well-studied algorithmic
graph problems, with many theoretical and practical applications. We focus on
solving this problem when the input $G$ has bounded degeneracy. This is a rich
family of graphs, containing all graphs without a fixed minor (e.g. planar
graphs), as well as graphs generated by various random processes (e.g.
preferential attachment graphs). We say that $H$ is easy if there is a
linear-time algorithm for counting the number of copies of $H$ in an input $G$
of bounded degeneracy. A seminal result of Chiba and Nishizeki from '85 states
that every $H$ on at most 4 vertices is easy. Bera, Pashanasangi, and Seshadhri
recently extended this to all $H$ on 5 vertices, and further proved that for
every $k > 5$ there is a $k$-vertex $H$ which is not easy. They left open the
natural problem of characterizing all easy graphs $H$.
  Bressan has recently introduced a framework for counting subgraphs in
degenerate graphs, from which one can extract a sufficient condition for a
graph $H$ to be easy. Here we show that this sufficient condition is also
necessary, thus fully answering the Bera--Pashanasangi--Seshadhri problem. We
further resolve two closely related problems; namely characterizing the graphs
that are easy with respect to counting induced copies, and with respect to
counting homomorphisms.

for many applications and possesses several unique design challenges; a key one
is the successful delivery of messages to the destination, reliably. For
reliable communication, routing plays an important role, which establishes a
path between source and destination on the basis of certain criteria.
Conventional routing protocols of FANET generally use a minimum hop count
criterion to find the best route between source and destination, which results
in lower latency with the consideration that there is single source/destination
network environment. However, in a network with multiple sources, the minimum
hop count routing criterion along with the 1-Hop HELLO messages broadcasted by
each node in the network may deteriorate the network performance in terms of
high End-to-End (ETE) delay and decrease in the lifetime of the network. This
research work proposes a Reliable link-adaptive position-based routing protocol
(RLPR) for FANET. It uses relative speed, signal strength, and energy of the
nodes along with the geographic distance towards the destination using a
forwarding angle. This angle is used to determine the forwarding zone that
decreases the undesirable control messages in the network in order to discover
the route. RLPR enhances the network performance by selecting those relay nodes
which are in the forwarding zone and whose geographic movement is towards the
destination. Additionally, RLPR selects the next hop with better energy level
and uses signal strength and relative speed of the nodes to achieve high
connectivity-level. Based on the performance evaluation performed in the
Network simulator (ns-2.35), it has been analysed that RLPR outperforms the
Robust and reliable predictive based routing (RARP) and Ad hoc on-demand
distance vector (AODV) protocols in different scenarios.

and contains an adjustable parameter. By choosing the adjustable parameter, one

counterterm and in celestial mechanics, the drift. It is known that there are
formal expansions in powers of the perturbation both for the quasi-periodic
solution and the counterterm.
  We prove that the asymptotic expansions for the quasiperiodic solutions and
the counterterm satisfy Gevrey estimates. That is, the $n$-th term of the
expansion is bounded by a power of $n!$. The Gevrey class (the power of $n!$)
depends only on the Diophantine condition of the frequency and the order of the
friction coefficient in powers of the perturbative parameter.

expansions. As it is custumary in KAM theory, each step of the method is
estimated in a smaller domain. In contrast with the KAM results, the domains
where we control the Newton method shrink very fast and the Newton method does
not prove that the solutions are analytic. On the other hand, by examining
carefully the process, we can obtain estimates on the coefficients of the
expansions and conclude the series are Gevrey.

concurrently, we simultaneously localize the sources and separate the
individual speakers. At the core of our method is a deep network, in the
waveform domain, which isolates sources within an angular region $\theta \pm
w/2$, given an angle of interest $\theta$ and angular window size $w$. By
exponentially decreasing $w$, we can perform a binary search to localize and
separate all sources in logarithmic time. Our algorithm allows for an arbitrary
number of potentially moving speakers at test time, including more speakers
than seen during training. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance
for both source separation and source localization, particularly in high levels
of background noise.

are able to prove the case where a sequence of Riemannian manifolds is
conformal to a uniformly controlled sequence of flat tori and satisfies the
geometric stability conjecture. We are also able to handle the case where a
sequence of Riemannian manifolds is conformal to a sequence of constant
negative scalar curvature Riemannian manifolds which converge to a flat torus
in $C^1$. The full conjecture from the conformal perspective is also discussed
as a possible approach to resolving the conjecture.

  Damage Evolution in Composite Laminates with Arbitrary Stacking Sequence",,,"10.1016/j.jcomc.2020.100066",,"math.NA cs.CE cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stiffness degradation and progressive failure of composite laminates are
complex processes involving evolution and multi-mode interactions among fiber
fractures, intra-ply matrix cracks and inter-ply delaminations. This paper
presents a novel finite element model capable of explicitly treating such
discrete failures in laminates of random layup. Matching of nodes is guaranteed
at potential crack bifurcations to ensure correct displacement jumps near crack
tips and explicit load transfer among cracks. The model is entirely
geometry-based (no mesh prerequisite) with distinct segments assembled together
using surface-based tie constraints, and thus requires no element partitioning
or enrichment. Several numerical examples are included to demonstrate the
model's ability to generate results that are in qualitative and quantitative
agreement with experimental observations on both damage evolution and tensile
strength of specimens. The present model is believed unique in realizing
simultaneous and accurate coupling of all three types of failures in laminates
having arbitrary ply angles and layup.

"2010.06010","Anke Stoll","Anke Stoll, Peter Benner","Machine Learning for Material Characterization with an Application for
  Predicting Mechanical Properties",,,,,"cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","  Currently, the growth of material data from experiments and simulations is
expanding beyond processable amounts. This makes the development of new
data-driven methods for the discovery of patterns among multiple lengthscales
and time-scales and structure-property relationships essential. These
data-driven approaches show enormous promise within materials science. The
following review covers machine learning applications for metallic material
characterization. Many parameters associated with the processing and the
structure of materials affect the properties and the performance of
manufactured components. Thus, this study is an attempt to investigate the
usefulness of machine learning methods for material property prediction.
Material characteristics such as strength, toughness, hardness, brittleness or
ductility are relevant to categorize a material or component according to their
quality. In industry, material tests like tensile tests, compression tests or
creep tests are often time consuming and expensive to perform. Therefore, the
application of machine learning approaches is considered helpful for an easier
generation of material property information. This study also gives an
application of machine learning methods on small punch test data for the
determination of the property ultimate tensile strength for various materials.
A strong correlation between small punch test data and tensile test data was
found which ultimately allows to replace more costly tests by simple and fast
tests in combination with machine learning.

a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $9~{\rm fb}^{-1}$ of
$pp$ collisions collected with the LHCb experiment. The analysis is conducted
in the very low dielectron mass squared ($q^2$) interval between $0.0008$ and
$0.257~{\rm GeV}^2$, where the rate is dominated by the $B^0\to K^{\ast
0}\gamma$ transition with a virtual photon. The fraction of longitudinal
polarisation of the $K^{\ast 0}$ meson, $F_{\rm L}$, is measured to be $F_{\rm
L} = (4.4 \pm 2.6 \pm 1.4)\%$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and
the second systematic. The $A_{\rm T}^{\rm Re}$ observable, which is related to
the lepton forward-backward asymmetry, is measured to be $A_{\rm T}^{\rm
Re}=-0.06 \pm 0.08 \pm 0.02$. The $A_{\rm T}^{(2)}$ and $A_{\rm T}^{\rm Im}$
transverse asymmetries, which are sensitive to the virtual photon polarisation,
are found to be $A_{\rm T}^{(2)} = 0.11 \pm 0.10 \ \pm 0.02$ and $A_{\rm
T}^{\rm Im} = 0.02 \pm 0.10 \pm 0.01$. The results are consistent with Standard

candidates for microelectronics, nano-photonics, and optoelectronics.
Transferred onto photonic integrated circuits (PICs), these semiconductor
materials have enabled new classes of light-emitting diodes, modulators and
photodetectors, that could be amenable to wafer-scale manufacturing. For
integrated photonic devices, the optical losses of the PICs are critical. In
contrast to silicon, silicon nitride (Si3N4) has emerged as a low-loss
integrated platform with a wide transparency window from ultraviolet to
mid-infrared and absence of two-photon absorption at telecommunication bands.
Moreover, it is suitable for nonlinear integrated photonics due to its high
Kerr nonlinearity and high-power handing capability. These features of Si3N4
are intrinsically beneficial for nanophotonics and optoelectronics
applications. Here we report a low-loss integrated platform incorporating
monolayer molybdenum ditelluride (1L-MoTe2) with Si3N4 photonic
microresonators. We show that, with the 1L-MoTe2, microresonator quality
factors exceeding 3 million in the telecommunication O-band to E-band are

resonance shift due to the presence of 1L-MoTe2, and extrapolate the optical
loss introduced by 1L-MoTe2 in the telecommunication bands, out of the
excitonic transition region. Our work presents a key step for low-loss, hybrid
PICs with layered semiconductors without using heterogeneous wafer bonding.

feedback. We analyze variants of the Exp3 algorithm that tune their step-size
using only information (about the losses and delays) available at the time of
the decisions, and obtain regret guarantees that adapt to the observed (rather
than the worst-case) sequences of delays and/or losses. First, through a
remarkably simple proof technique, we show that with proper tuning of the step
size, the algorithm achieves an optimal (up to logarithmic factors) regret of
order $\sqrt{\log(K)(TK + D)}$ both in expectation and in high probability,
where $K$ is the number of arms, $T$ is the time horizon, and $D$ is the
cumulative delay. The high-probability version of the bound, which is the first
high-probability delay-adaptive bound in the literature, crucially depends on
the use of implicit exploration in estimating the losses. Then, following
Zimmert and Seldin [2019], we extend these results so that the algorithm can
""skip"" rounds with large delays, resulting in regret bounds of order
$\sqrt{TK\log(K)} + |R| + \sqrt{D_{\bar{R}}\log(K)}$, where $R$ is an arbitrary
set of rounds (which are skipped) and $D_{\bar{R}}$ is the cumulative delay of
the feedback for other rounds. Finally, we present another, data-adaptive
(AdaGrad-style) version of the algorithm for which the regret adapts to the
observed (delayed) losses instead of only adapting to the cumulative delay
(this algorithm requires an a priori upper bound on the maximum delay, or the
advance knowledge of the delay for each decision when it is made). The
resulting bound can be orders of magnitude smaller on benign problems, and it
can be shown that the delay only affects the regret through the loss of the
best arm.

standard way to solve Polynomial Eigenvalue Problems is by means of
linearizations. The most frequently used linearizations belong to general

{\em companion linearizations}. It is well known, however, that is not possible
to construct companion linearizations that preserve any of the previous
structures for matrix polynomials of even degree. This motivates the search for
more general companion forms, in particular {\em companion $\ell$-ifications}.

initiative to address eminent problems in developing reliable computer aided
detection and diagnosis endoscopy systems and suggest a pathway for clinical
translation of technologies. Whilst endoscopy is a widely used diagnostic and
treatment tool for hollow-organs, there are several core challenges often faced
by endoscopists, mainly: 1) presence of multi-class artefacts that hinder their
visual interpretation, and 2) difficulty in identifying subtle precancerous
precursors and cancer abnormalities. Artefacts often affect the robustness of
deep learning methods applied to the gastrointestinal tract organs as they can
be confused with tissue of interest. EndoCV2020 challenges are designed to
address research questions in these remits. In this paper, we present a summary
of methods developed by the top 17 teams and provide an objective comparison of
state-of-the-art methods and methods designed by the participants for two
sub-challenges: i) artefact detection and segmentation (EAD2020), and ii)

multi-class, and multi-modal clinical endoscopy datasets were compiled for both

improvements, only a few methods hold credibility for clinical usability. The

we theoretically quantify the gradient variance via correlating the gradient
covariance with the Hamming distance between two different masks (given a

propose a fully-explored masking strategy, where a text sequence is divided
into a certain number of non-overlapping segments. Thereafter, the tokens
within one segment are masked for training. We prove, from a theoretical
perspective, that the gradients derived from this new masking schema have a
smaller variance and can lead to more efficient self-supervised training. We
conduct extensive experiments on both continual pre-training and general
pre-training from scratch. Empirical results confirm that this new masking

generation, machine learning, evaluation and results) and clinical
applicability (research implications, clinical potential, risk of bias and

51 studies, very few have been implemented in clinical research or practice. We
concluded that the main limitations of the field are poor standardisation,
limited comparability of results, and a degree of disconnect between study aims

Incorporating the already-known physical laws into the training process can

establish a neural network-based computational framework to characterize the

the F\""oppl--von K\'arm\'an (FvK) equations with a set of boundary conditions

input and the displacement field as the output to approximate the exact
solution of the FvK equations. The physical information (PDEs, BCs, and
potential energies) is then incorporated into the loss function, and a pseudo
dataset is sampled without knowing the exact solution to finally train the
neural network. The prediction accuracy of the modeling framework is carefully
examined by applying it to four different loading cases: in-plane tension with
non-uniformly distributed stretching forces, in-plane central-hole tension,
out-of-plane deflection, and buckling under compression. \hl{Three ways of
formulating the loss function are compared: 1) purely data-driven, 2)
PDE-based, and 3) energy-based. Through the comparison with the finite element
simulations, it is found that all the three approaches can characterize the
elastic deformation of plates with a satisfactory accuracy if trained properly.
Compared with incorporating the PDEs and BCs in the loss, using the total
potential energy shows certain advantage in terms of the simplicity of
hyperparameter tuning and the computational efficiency.

states without doing full tomography. One of the most widespread schemes of
witnessing entanglement is measuring its fidelity with respect to a pure
entangled state. Recently, a large class of states whose entanglement can not
be detected with the fidelity witness has been discovered in Phys.Rev.Lett
\textbf{124},200502(2020). They are called unfaithful states. In this paper we
propose a new way to detect entanglement by calculating the lower bound of
entanglement using measurement results. Numerical simulation shows our method
can detect entanglement in unfaithful states with a small number of
measurements. Moreover, we generalize our scheme to multipartite states and
show that it can tolerate higher noise than previous entanglement witness
operators with same number of measurement settings.

density matrix. The resulting many-body wave function, which can be produced
for any fermion systems, including those with purely repulsive interactions,
has the form of a number-projected BCS form, or antisymmetrized germinal power
(AGP). Such wave functions provide a better ansatz for correlated fermion
systems than a single Slater determinant, and often better than a linear
combination of Slater determinants (for example from a truncated active space
calculation). We describe a procedure to build such a wave function
conveniently from a given reduced density matrix of the system, rather than
from a mean-field solution (which gives a Slater determinant for repulsive
interactions). The pseudo-BCS wave function thus obtained reproduces the
density matrix or minimizes the difference between the input and resulting
density matrices. One application of the pseudo-BCS wave function is in
auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) calculations as the trial wave
function to control the sign/phase problem. AFQMC is often among the most
accurate general methods for correlated fermion systems. We show that the
pseudo-BCS form further reduces the constraint bias and leads to improved
accuracy compared to the usual Slater determinant trial wave functions, using
the two-dimensional Hubbard model as an example. Furthermore, the pseudo-BCS
trial wave function allows a new systematically improvable self-consistent
approach, with pseudo-BCS trial wave function iteratively generated by AFQMC
via the one-body density matrix.

autocatalytic and reproducing system subject to evolutionary selection it must
satisfy at least two apparently contradictory requirements: Because such
systems are rare, a search among vast numbers of molecular combinations must
take place naturally, requiring rapid rearrangement and breaking of covalent
bonds. But once a relevant system is found, such rapid disruption and
rearrangement would be very likely to destroy the system before much evolution
could take place. In this paper we explore the possibility, using a model
developed previously, that the search process could occur under different
environmental conditions than the subsequent fixation and growth of a lifelike
chemical system. We use the example of a rapid change in temperature to
illustrate the effect and refer to the rapid change as a `quench' borrowing
terminology from study of the physics and chemistry of glass formation. The
model study shows that interrupting a high temperature nonequilibrium state
with a rapid quench to lower temperatures can substantially increase the
probability of producing a chemical state with lifelike characteristics of
nonequilibrium metastability, internal dynamics and exponential population
growth in time. Previously published data on the length distributions of
proteomes of prokaryotes may be consistent with such an idea and suggest a
prebiotic high temperature `search' phase near the boiling point of water. A
rapid change in pH could have a similar effect. We discuss possible scenarios
on early earth which might have allowed frequent quenches of the sort
considered here to have occurred. The models show a strong dependence of the

very large number of galactic and extra-galactic objects, and the large and
complex nature of the image data reinforces the use of automation. Here we
describe the design and implementation of a data analysis process for automatic
broad morphology annotation of galaxies, and applied it to the data of
Pan-STARRS DR1. The process is based on filters followed by a two-step
convolutional neural network (CNN) classification. Training samples are
generated by using an augmented and balanced set of manually classified
galaxies. Results are evaluated for accuracy by comparison to the annotation of
Pan-STARRS included in a previous broad morphology catalog of SDSS galaxies.
Our analysis shows that a CNN combined with several filters is an effective
approach for annotating the galaxies and removing unclean images. The catalog
contains morphology labels for 1,662,190 galaxies with ~95% accuracy. The
accuracy can be further improved by selecting labels above certain confidence
thresholds. The catalog is publicly available.

developers can now exploit unprecedented external memory bandwidth. This allows
more memory-bounded applications to benefit from FPGA acceleration. However, we
found that it is not easy to fully utilize the available bandwidth when
developing some applications with high-level synthesis (HLS) tools. This is due
to the limitation of existing HLS tools when accessing HBM board's large number
of independent external memory channels. In this paper, we measure the
performance of three recent representative HBM FPGA boards (Intel's Stratix 10

mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) treating PTSD, we conducted a
randomized clinical trial (RCT) in which 98 veterans with PTSD were randomly
assigned to receive MBSR therapy (n = 47) or present-centered group therapy
(PCGT; n = 51; an active-control condition). Pre- and post-intervention
measures of PTSD symptom severity (PTSD Checklist) and brain activity measures
of electroencephalography (EEG) were assessed, including spectral power of
spontaneous neural oscillatory activities during resting and meditation
periods, time-frequency (TF) power of cognitive task-related brain responses,
and TF power of heartbeat-evoked brain responses (HEBR) that reflect cardiac
interoceptive brain responses during resting and meditation. Compared to
controls, the MBSR group had greater improvements in PTSD symptoms, spontaneous
EEG alpha (8-13 Hz) power in posterior sites, task-related frontal theta power
(4-7 Hz in 140-220 ms post-stimulus), and frontal theta HEBR (3-5 Hz and
265-328 ms post-R-peak). Latent difference score modeling found that only the
changes in the frontal theta HEBR mediated the MBSR treatment effect. Brain
source-level analysis found that the theta HEBR changes in the anterior
cingulate cortex, anterior insular cortex, and the lateral prefrontal cortex
predicted PTSD symptom improvements. These results indicated that mindfulness
meditation improves spontaneous brain activities reflecting internally oriented
relaxation and brain functions of attentional control. However, interoceptive
brain capacity enhanced by MBSR appears to be the primary cerebral mechanism

services. In this work we present a spatial-temporal point process model for
drug overdose clustering. The data input into the model comes from two
heterogeneous sources: 1) high volume emergency medical calls for service (EMS)
records containing location and time, but no information on the type of
non-fatal overdose and 2) fatal overdose toxicology reports from the coroner
containing location and high-dimensional information from the toxicology screen
on the drugs present at the time of death. We first use non-negative matrix
factorization to cluster toxicology reports into drug overdose categories and
we then develop an EM algorithm for integrating the two heterogeneous data
sets, where the mark corresponding to overdose category is inferred for the EMS
data and the high volume EMS data is used to more accurately predict drug
overdose death hotspots. We apply the algorithm to drug overdose data from
Indianapolis, showing that the point process defined on the integrated data
outperforms point processes that use only homogeneous EMS (AUC improvement .72
to .8) or coroner data (AUC improvement .81 to .85).We also investigate the
extent to which overdoses are contagious, as a function of the type of
overdose, while controlling for exogenous fluctuations in the background rate
that might also contribute to clustering. We find that drug and opioid overdose
deaths exhibit significant excitation, with branching ratio ranging from .72 to

immunogenomics, traces correspond to mutated copies of genes, with mutations
generated naturally by the adaptive immune system. In DNA data storage, traces
correspond to noisy copies of DNA molecules that encode digital data, with
errors being artifacts of the data retrieval process. In this paper, we
introduce several new trace generation models and open questions relevant to

the dataset with question paraphrases from visual question generation models or
adversarial perturbations. These approaches use the combined data to learn an
answer classifier by minimizing the standard cross-entropy loss. To more
effectively leverage augmented data, we build on the recent success in
contrastive learning. We propose a novel training paradigm (ConClaT) that

encourages representations to be robust to linguistic variations in questions
while the cross-entropy loss preserves the discriminative power of
representations for answer prediction.
  We find that optimizing both losses -- either alternately or jointly -- is
key to effective training. On the VQA-Rephrasings benchmark, which measures the
VQA model's answer consistency across human paraphrases of a question, ConClaT
improves Consensus Score by 1 .63% over an improved baseline. In addition, on

produce a huge volume of low-resolution images of both distant galaxies and dim
stars in our own galaxy. Being able to automatically classify these images is a
long-standing problem in astronomy and critical to a number of different
scientific analyses. Recently, the challenge of ""star-galaxy"" classification
has been approached with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are good at
learning complex nonlinear embeddings. However, DNNs are known to
overconfidently extrapolate on unseen data and require a large volume of
training images that accurately capture the data distribution to be considered
reliable. Gaussian Processes (GPs), which infer posterior distributions over
functions and naturally quantify uncertainty, haven't been a tool of choice for
this task mainly because popular kernels exhibit limited expressivity on
complex and high-dimensional data.
  In this paper, we present a novel approach to the star-galaxy separation
problem that uses GPs and reap their benefits while solving many of the issues
traditionally affecting them for classification of high-dimensional celestial
image data. After an initial filtering of the raw data of star and galaxy image
cutouts, we first reduce the dimensionality of the input images by using a
Principal Components Analysis (PCA) before applying GPs using a simple Radial
Basis Function (RBF) kernel on the reduced data. Using this method, we greatly
improve the accuracy of the classification over a basic application of GPs
while improving the computational efficiency and scalability of the method.

star crusts and of the interior of a new class of stars known as strangelet
dwarfs. In this work we calculate the surface tension $\sigma$ and the
curvature coefficient $\gamma$ of charged strangelets as a function of the
baryon number density, the temperature, the chemical potential of trapped
neutrinos, the strangelet size, the electric potential and the electric charge
at their boundary. Strange quark matter in chemical equilibrium and with global
electric charge neutrality is described within the MIT bag model. We focus on
three different astrophysical scenarios, namely cold strange stars, proto
strange stars and post merger strange stars. Finite size effects are
implemented within the multiple reflection expansion framework. We find that
$\sigma$ decreases significantly as the strangelet's boundary becomes more
positively charged. This occurs because $\sigma$ is dominated by the
contribution of $s$ quarks which are the most massive particles in the system.
Negatively charged $s$-quarks are suppressed in strangelets with a large
positive electric charge, diminishing their contribution to $\sigma$ and
resulting in smaller values of the total $\sigma$. We verify that the more
extreme astrophysical scenarios, with higher temperatures and higher neutrino
chemical potentials, allow higher positive values of the strangelet's electric
charge at the boundary and consequently smaller values of $\sigma$. In
contrast, $\gamma$ is strongly dominated by the density of light ($u$ and $d$)
quarks and is quite independent of the charge-per-baryon ratio, the temperature
and neutrino trapping. We discuss the relative importance of surface and
curvature effects as well as some astrophysical consequences of these results.

observations and assessment of clinical signs, including the characterization

suffer from subjectivity as they rely on the evaluation of movements that are
sometimes subtle to human eyes and therefore difficult to classify, leading to
possible misclassification. In the meantime, early non-motor symptoms of PD may
be mild and can be caused by many other conditions. Therefore, these symptoms
are often overlooked, making diagnosis of PD at an early stage challenging. To
address these difficulties and to refine the diagnosis and assessment
procedures of PD, machine learning methods have been implemented for the
classification of PD and healthy controls or patients with similar clinical
presentations (e.g., movement disorders or other Parkinsonian syndromes). To
provide a comprehensive overview of data modalities and machine learning
methods that have been used in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of PD,
in this study, we conducted a systematic literature review of studies published

209 studies were included, extracted for relevant information and presented in
this systematic review, with an investigation of their aims, sources of data,

demonstrate a high potential for adaptation of machine learning methods and
novel biomarkers in clinical decision making, leading to increasingly

sputtering (HiPIMS), that represent low and moderate ionized flux fraction of
the film forming material, respectively, for deposition of the Py layers. The
effect of substrate roughness, working gas pressure and sputter power on the
in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the films are studied. The multilayers
were characterized by X-ray reflectivity and diffraction, and by
magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). It is shown that HiPIMS deposition produces
multilayers with unique surface roughness regardless of the substrate surface
roughness. Multilayers prepared by both dcMS and HiPIMS deposition present a
strong (111) texture normal to the film plane. The results show that utilizing
HiPIMS for deposition of the Py layer leads to a minimum interface mixing
between individual layers compared to dcMS deposition performed at sputter
power. This is associated with the smooth surface of Py deposited by HiPIMS.
However, this sharp interface results in higher coercivity and an opening in
the hard axis hysteresis loops while multilayers with intermixing present well
defined in-plane uniaxial anisotropy i.e. a linear hard axis. Comparison with
Py/Cu and Py/CuPt multilayers, prepared under identical conditions using

Given a set of points of interests (POI), a set of refueling stations for UVs,

random, the objective is to determine route for each UV starting and
terminating at the base station such that overall incentives collected by

automated decisions made by models in high-stake domains. Organizations that
employ these models may also need to satisfy regulations that promote
responsible and ethical A.I. While fairness metrics relying on comparing model
error rates across subpopulations have been widely investigated for the
detection and mitigation of bias, fairness in terms of the equalized ability to
achieve recourse for different protected attribute groups has been relatively
unexplored. We present a novel formulation for training neural networks that
considers the distance of data points to the decision boundary such that the
new objective: (1) reduces the average distance to the decision boundary
between two groups for individuals subject to a negative outcome in each group,
i.e. the network is more fair with respect to the ability to obtain recourse,
and (2) increases the average distance of data points to the boundary to
promote adversarial robustness. We demonstrate that training with this loss
yields more fair and robust neural networks with similar accuracies to models
trained without it. Moreover, we qualitatively motivate and empirically show
that reducing recourse disparity across groups also improves fairness measures
that rely on error rates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
that recourse capabilities across groups are considered to train fairer neural
networks, and a relation between error rates based fairness and recourse based
fairness is investigated.

authors, robots don't use physical properties to improve object recognition.
Estimation of an object's weight during a manipulation task is something new in
the @Home league and such ability can improve performance of domestic service
robots. In this work we propose to estimate the weight of the grasped object
using Sliding Mode Observers. If we consider the manipulator without load as
the nominal system and object's weight as a fault signal, we can estimate such
weight by an appropriate filtering of the output error injection term of the
sliding mode observer. To implement our proposal we used MATLAB and Simulink
Robotics System Toolbox, ROS Toolbox and Simscape. To improve computation time
we exported all algorithms to standalone ROS nodes from Simulink models. Tests
were performed using two platforms: Justina's left manipulator (a robot
developed at Biorobotics Laboratory, UNAM) and Neuronics Katana manipulators.
We present results in simulation and discuss the performance of the proposed

encoded as a sequence of distances and turning angles to assist
self-localization. We pose the learning process as a conditional sequence
prediction problem in which each output locates the object on a traversable
path in a map. Considering the prediction sequence ought to be topologically
connected in the graph-structured map, we adopt two different hypotheses
generation and elimination strategies to eliminate disconnected sequence
prediction. We demonstrate our approach on the KITTI stereo visual odometry

that 1) we take advantage of powerful sequence modeling ability of recurrent
neural network and its robustness to noisy input, 2) only require a map in the
form of a graph and simply use an affordable sensor that generates motion
trajectory and 3) do not need initial position. The experiments show that the

range from 1 to 25 MHz. The measured cross-spectral density between both

to identify any fundamental frequencies bins that have excess power above
5$\sigma$. Second, we reduce the per-bin threshold on any individual frequency
bin by employing that a fundamental frequency and its harmonics all
collectively lie above a threshold. We vary the number of harmonics searched
over from $n= 4$ up to $n=23$. Third, we perform an agnostic approach to

observations of $14$ Quasars at $z>6.5$ with mass estimates to constrain their
seeds and early growth, by self-consistently considering the spin evolution and
the possibility of super-Eddington accretion. We find that spin plays an
important role in the growth of early SMBHs, and the constraints on seed mass
and super-Eddington accretion fraction strongly depend on the assumed accretion
history. If the accretion is coherent with single (or a small number of)
episode(s), leading to high spins for the majority of accretion time, then the
SMBH growth is relatively slow; and if the accretion is chaotic with many
episodes and in each episode the total accreted mass is much less than the SMBH
mass, leading to moderate/low spins, then the growth is relatively fast. The
constraints on the seed mass and super-Eddington accretion fraction are
degenerate. A significant fraction ($\gtrsim0.1\%-1\%$ in linear scale but
$\sim 3-4$ dex in logarithmic scale for $10^3-10^4 M_\odot$ seeds) of

  Diversity","Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems","IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 2020","10.1109/TAES.2020.3034025",,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The vulnerability of Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to jammers is
a major concern owing to the extremely weak received signal power of GPS.
Researches have been conducted on a variety of antenna array techniques to be
used as countermeasures to GPS jammers, and their antijamming performance is
known to be greater than that of single antenna methods. However, the
application of antenna arrays remains limited because of their size, cost, and
computational complexity. This study proposes and experimentally validates a
novel space-time-polarization domain adaptive processing for a single-element
dual-polarized antenna (STPAPS) by focusing on the polarization diversity of a
dual-polarized antenna. The mathematical models of arbitrarily polarized
signals received by dual-polarized antenna are derived, and an appropriate
constraint matrix for dual-polarized-antenna-based GPS antijam is suggested. To
reduce the computational complexity of the constraint matrix approach, the
eigenvector constraint design scheme is adopted. The performance of STPAPS is
quantitively and qualitatively evaluated through experiments as follows. 1) The
carrier-to-noise-density ratio (C/N0) of STPAPS under synthetic jamming is
demonstrated to be higher than that of the previous minimum mean squared error
(MMSE) or minimum variance distortionless response (MVDR) based dual-polarized
antenna methods. 2) The strengths and weaknesses of STPAPS are qualitatively
compared with those of the previous single-element dual-polarized antenna
methods that are not based on the MMSE or MVDR algorithms. 3) The
characteristics of STPAPS (in terms of the directions and polarizations of the
GPS and jamming signals) are compared with those of the conventional
two-element single-polarized antenna array method, which has the same degree of
freedom as that of STPAPS.

  for Refining Arbitrary Dense Adversarial Attacks",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Deep neural network image classifiers are reported to be susceptible to
adversarial evasion attacks, which use carefully crafted images created to
mislead a classifier. Many adversarial attacks belong to the category of dense
attacks, which generate adversarial examples by perturbing all the pixels of a
natural image. To generate sparse perturbations, sparse attacks have been
recently developed, which are usually independent attacks derived by modifying
a dense attack's algorithm with sparsity regularisations, resulting in reduced
attack efficiency. In this paper, we aim to tackle this task from a different
perspective. We select the most effective perturbations from the ones generated
from a dense attack, based on the fact we find that a considerable amount of
the perturbations on an image generated by dense attacks may contribute little
to attacking a classifier. Accordingly, we propose a probabilistic post-hoc
framework that refines given dense attacks by significantly reducing the number
of perturbed pixels but keeping their attack power, trained with mutual
information maximisation. Given an arbitrary dense attack, the proposed model
enjoys appealing compatibility for making its adversarial images more realistic
and less detectable with fewer perturbations. Moreover, our framework performs
adversarial attacks much faster than existing sparse attacks.

that appeared over an 8-year period from 2010 to 2017 during solar cycle 24,
using photospheric vector magnetic field observations by the Helioseismic and

estimates of $dH/dt$ show that 63% and 65% of the investigated AR samples in
the northern and southern hemispheres, respectively, follow the HSP. We also
find a trend that the HSP of $dH/dt$ increases from ~50-60% up to ~70-80% as
ARs (1) appear at the earlier inclining phase of the solar cycle or higher
latitudes; (2) have larger values of $|dH/dt|$, the total unsigned magnetic
flux, and the average plasma flow speed. These observational findings support
the enhancement of the HSP mainly by the Coriolis force acting on a buoyantly
rising and expanding flux tube through the turbulent convection zone. In
addition, the differential rotation on the solar surface as well as the
tachocline $\alpha$-effect of flux-transport dynamo may reinforce the HSP for
ARs at higher latitudes.

time-consuming and error-prone task. Learning-based classification systems
automatically extract such rules from positive and negative traffic examples.
However, due to limitations in the representation of network traffic and the
learning strategy, these systems lack both expressiveness to cover a range of
attacks and interpretability in fully describing the attack traffic's structure
at the session layer. This paper presents Sharingan system, which uses program
synthesis techniques to generate network classification programs at the session
layer. Sharingan accepts raw network traces as inputs, and reports potential
patterns of the attack traffic in NetQRE, a domain specific language designed
for specifying session-layer quantitative properties. Using Sharingan, network
operators can better analyze the attack pattern due to the following advantages
of Sharingan's learning process: (1) it requires minimal feature engineering,
(2) it is amenable to efficient implementation of the learnt classifier, and
(3) the synthesized program is easy to decipher and edit. We develop a range of
novel optimizations that reduce the synthesis time for large and complex tasks
to a matter of minutes. Our experiments show that Sharingan is able to
correctly identify attacks from a diverse set of network attack traces and
generates explainable outputs, while achieving accuracy comparable to

phase transition, such as in the XY model, which can be difficult for

authors of [Nature Physics \textbf{15},790 (2019)] employed the diffusion-map
method for identifying topological order and were able to determine the BKT
phase transition of the XY model, specifically via the intersection of the
average cluster distance $\bar{D}$ and the within cluster dispersion
$\bar\sigma$ (when the different clusters vary from separation to mixing
together). However, sometimes it is not easy to find the intersection if
$\bar{D}$ or $\bar{\sigma}$ does not change too much due to topological
constraint. In this paper, we propose to use the Calinski-Harabaz ($ch$) index,
defined roughly as the ratio $\bar D/\bar \sigma$, to determine the critical
points, at which the $ch$ index reaches a maximum or minimum value, or jump
sharply. We examine the $ch$ index in several statistical models, including
ones that contain a BKT phase transition. For the Ising model, the peaks of the
quantity $ch$ or its components are consistent with the position of the
specific heat maximum. For the XY model both on the square lattices and
honeycomb lattices, our results of the $ch$ index show the convergence of the
peaks over a range of the parameters $\varepsilon/\varepsilon_0$ in the
Gaussian kernel. We also examine the generalized XY model with $q=2$ and $q=8$
and at the value away from the pure XY limit. Our method is thus useful to both
topological and non-topological phase transitions and can achieve accuracy as
good as supervised learning methods previously used in these models, and may be
used for searching phases from experimental data.

an arbitrary distance in feature space but only in random low-dimensional

intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) of mass $\sim 142\text{M}_\odot$. Both

they are within the upper black-hole mass gap. We propose a dynamical formation
pathway for this IMBH based on multiple mergers in the core of a globular

stellar black hole undergoing a chain of seven binary mergers within 6 Gyr,
attaining a final mass of $97.8\text{M}_\odot$. We discuss the dynamical

the black hole population in that simulation. We explore statistically the
effects of gravitational recoil on the viability of such hierarchical mergers.
From the analysis of all 58 simulations we observe additional smaller chains,
tentatively inferring that an IMBH formation through hierarchical mergers is
expected in the lifetime of a median mass globular cluster with probability
$0.01 \lesssim p \lesssim 0.1$ without gravitational merger recoil. Using this
order-of-magnitude estimate we show our results are broadly consistent with the
rate implied by GW190521, assuming that gravitational recoil ejection of

most medical images such as MRI and CT are volumetric data. In order to make
full use of volumetric information, 3D CNNs are widely used. However, 3D CNNs
suffer from higher inference time and computation cost, which hinders their
further clinical applications. Additionally, with the increased number of
parameters, the risk of overfitting is higher, especially for medical images
where data and annotations are expensive to acquire. To issue this problem,
many 2.5D segmentation methods have been proposed to make use of volumetric
spatial information with less computation cost. Despite these works lead to
improvements on a variety of segmentation tasks, to the best of our knowledge,
there has not previously been a large-scale empirical comparison of these

of 2.5D methods for volumetric medical image segmentation. Additionally, to
compare the performance and effectiveness of these methods, we provide an

that 3D CNNs may not always be the best choice. Despite all these 2.5D methods

benefits on different datasets. We hope the results and conclusions of our
study will prove useful for the community on exploring and developing efficient

the major achievements of attosecond science. This delay can have two origins -
the electron wave packet is reshaped during departure by the electrostatic

remaining electrons. Most experiments have observed the former, but
confirmation requires a complex calculation. A direct measurement of
multielectron dynamics is needed. Photo-recombination - the inverse of
photoionization - occurs naturally during electron recollision and can be
measured by combining a perturbing beam to modify the recollision electron
before recombination. These in situ methods allow us to unambiguously isolate
multielectron dynamics - the reference being the spectral phase of an
attosecond pulse simultaneously measured in spectral regions without
multielectron interaction. Here, we measure the group delay of the recollision
electron caused by plasmonic resonance dynamics in Xe, simulate the in situ
measured spectral phase of a recollision electron generated in the presence of
the plasmonic resonance in C$_{60}$ and present a corresponding semi-classical

magnetoconvection (RMC) in presence of vertical external magnetic field. We
focus on the dynamics appearing near the onset of convection by varying the
system control parameters, namely, the Taylor number ($\mathrm{Ta}$), the
Chandrasekhar number ($\mathrm{Q}$) and the Prandtl number ($\mathrm{Pr}$) in
the ranges $750\leq\mathrm{Ta}\leq10^6$, $0 < \mathrm{Q} \leq 10^3$ and $0 <
\mathrm{Pr} \leq 0.5$. Three dimensional (3D) direct numerical simulations
(DNS) of the governing equations and low-dimensional modeling of the system are
performed for this purpose. Extensive DNS in the specified parameter space
shows two qualitatively different onsets depending on $\mathrm{Ta}$,
$\mathrm{Q}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}$. In the first one, bistability appears at the
onset, where both subcritical and supercritical convection coexist, while only
supercritical convection is observed in the second one. Analysis of the
low-dimensional model reveals that a supercritical Hopf bifurcation is
responsible for the supercritical onset and a subcritical pitchfork bifurcation
is responsible for the subcritical onset. It is also observed that appearance
of subcritical convection at the onset has strong dependence on all three
control parameters $\mathrm{Ta}$, $\mathrm{Q}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}$. The scenario
of subcritical convection is found to disappear as $\mathrm{Pr}$ is increased
for fixed $\mathrm{Ta}$ and $\mathrm{Q}$. However, most striking findings of
the investigation is that the increment in $\mathrm{Ta}$ for fixed $\mathrm{Q}$
and $\mathrm{Pr}$ opposes the subcritical convection, whereas the increment in
$\mathrm{Q}$ for fixed $\mathrm{Ta}$ and $\mathrm{Pr}$ favors it. This is in
sharp contrast with the earlier results reported in RMC.

chromosphere and transition region is important. One way is to extrapolate the
magnetic field and plasma from the routinely measured vector magnetogram on the
photosphere based on the assumption of the magnetohydrostatic (MHS) state.
However, photospheric data may be inconsistent with the MHS assumption.
Therefore, we must study the restriction on the photospheric magnetic field,
which is required by the MHS system. Moreover, the data should be transformed
accordingly before MHS extrapolations can be applied.
  Aims. We aim to obtain a set of surface integrals as criteria for the MHS
system and use this set of integrals to preprocess a vector magnetogram.
  Methods. By applying Gauss' theorem and assuming an isolated active region on
the Sun, we related the magnetic energy and forces in the volume to the surface
integral on the photosphere. The same method was applied to obtain restrictions
on the photospheric magnetic field as necessary criteria for a MHS system. We
used an optimization method to preprocess the data to minimize the deviation
from the criteria as well as the measured value.
  Results. By applying the virial theorem to the active region, we find the
boundary integral that is used to compute the energy of a force-free field
usually underestimates the magnetic energy of a large active region. We also
find that the MHS assumption only requires the x-, y-component of net Lorentz
force and the z-component of net torque to be zero. These zero components are
part of Aly's criteria for a force-free field. However, other components of net
force and torque can be non-zero values. According to new criteria, we
preprocess the magnetogram to make it more consistent with the MHS system and,
at the same time close, to the original data.

train and has a gap with the projected architecture for evaluation. In this
paper, we formulate neural architecture search as a sparse coding problem. We
perform the differentiable search on a compressed lower-dimensional space that
has the same validation loss as the original sparse solution space, and recover
an architecture by solving the sparse coding problem. The differentiable search
and architecture recovery are optimized in an alternate manner. By doing so,
our network for search at each update satisfies the sparsity constraint and is
efficient to train. In order to also eliminate the depth and width gap between
the network in search and the target-net in evaluation, we further propose a
method to search and evaluate in one stage under the target-net settings. When
training finishes, architecture variables are absorbed into network weights.
Thus we get the searched architecture and optimized parameters in a single run.

excite these states independently and observe them individually anywhere in the
sample. The modes mutual interaction and their coupling to the sample
boundaries makes it extremely challenging to isolate them spectrally and image
them alone. In the presence of gain, random lasing occurs above threshold and
lasing modes are excited. It was shown recently that shaping the intensity
profile of the optical pump is a very effective way to control and force random
lasing in singlemode regime at any desired emission wavelength. Active random
media therefore offer a unique platform to select modes individually. By using
pump shaping technique in a strongly scattering random laser, we successfully

Majorana Kramers pairs respond to an applied magnetic field anisotropically due
to the interplay between time-reversal and crystal symmetries. In this paper,
we propose a systematic procedure to determine such surface magnetic responses
in systems with an order-two symmetry. From the analysis of topological
invariants associated with an order-two symmetry, it is found that magnetic
responses are classified into four types, which are attributed to different
topological invariants and exhibit distinguishable, characteristic magnetic
responses. For a Kramers pair of Majorana fermions protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2$
topological invariants, we clarify that types of magnetic responses are
determined only from Fermi--surface topology and symmetry of Cooper pairs.
Finally, we apply our theory to the topological nonsymmorphic crystalline
superconducting state in UCoGe, which exhibits a biaxially anisotropic magnetic

considered earlier. In contrast to previous works, on the one hand, we do not
require any properties concerning positive homogeneity of the Hamiltonian in
the impulse variable, and on the other hand, we suppose that the Hamiltonian
satisfies a Lipshitz continuity condition with respect to the path variable in
the uniform (supremum) norm. The progress is related to the fact that a
suitable Lyapunov--Krasovskii functional is built that allows to prove a
comparison principle. This functional is in some sense equivalent to the square
of the uniform norm of the path variable and, at the same time, it possesses
appropriate smoothness properties. In addition, the paper provides non-local

noncentrosymmetric materials leads to the band splitting and non-trivial spin
polarization in the momentum space. However, in some cases, zero net spin
polarization in the split bands may occurs, dubbed as the band splitting with
vanishing spin polarization (BSVSP) effect, protected by non-pseudo-polar point
group symmetry of the wave vector in the first Brillouin zone [Liu et. al.,
Nat. Commun. \textbf{10}, 5144 (2019)]. In this paper, by using
first-principles calculations, we show that the BSVSP effect emerges in
two-dimensional (2D) nonsymmorphic Ga$XY$ ($X$= Se, Te; $Y$= Cl, Br, I) family,
a new class of 2D materials having in-plane ferroelectricity. Taking the GaTeCl
monolayer as a representative example, we observe the BSVSP effect in the split
bands along the $X-M$ line located in the proximity of the conduction band
minimum. By using $\vec{k}\cdot\vec{p}$ Hamiltonian derived based on the
symmetry analysis, we clarify that such effect is originated from the
cancellation of the local spin polarization, enforced by non-pseudo-polar
$C_{2v}$ point group symmetry of the wave vector along the $X-M$ line.
Importantly, we find that the spin polarization can be effectively induced by
applying an external out-of-plane electric field, indicating that an
electrically tunable spin polarization for spintronic applications is
plausible.

cast output to 16-bit precision, we show that nearest rounding for model weight
updates often cancels small updates, which degrades the convergence and model
accuracy. Motivated by this, we study two simple techniques well-established in
numerical analysis, stochastic rounding and Kahan summation, to remedy the
model accuracy degradation in 16-bit-FPU training. We demonstrate that these

Though the propagation of GW is insensitive to $c_{\rm s}$ in itself, the sound
speed value affects the dynamics of primordial density (or scalar curvature)
perturbations and the induced GW by their horizon reentry can then be an
indirect probe both $w$ and $c_{\rm s}$. We numerically reveal the concrete
spectrum of the predicted induced GW with two simple examples of the scalar
perturbation spectrum: the monochromatic and scale-invariant spectra. In the
monochromatic case, we see that the resonant amplification and cancellation
scales of the induced GW depend on the $c_{\rm s}$ values at different time
respectively. The scale-invariant case gives a more realistic spectrum and its
specific shape will be compared with observations. In particular, the QCD phase
transition corresponds with the frequency range of the pulsar timing array

of $10^{-4}\lesssim A_\zeta\lesssim10^{-2}$, the induced GW is consistent with
current observational constraints and detectable in the future observation in

GWs by NANOGrav 12.5 yr analysis~[1] can be explained by the induced GW if

a predefined gesture. By using a concept-based approach, this paper discusses
the practical issue of obtaining concepts for a unique vocabulary personalized

compare concepts obtained automatically through a natural language processing

then identify three limitations of the NLP approach: at the semantic level with
emojis and symbols; at the semantic level with slang, new words, and buzzwords;
and at the pragmatic level. We attribute these limitations to the personalized
vocabulary of Rinna. A follow-up experiment demonstrates that robot gestures
selected using a concept-based approach leave a better impression than randomly
selected gestures for the Rinna vocabulary, suggesting the usefulness of a
concept-based gesture generation system for personalized vocabularies. This
study provides insights into the development of gesture generation systems for

combination of past caching strategies. A high probability generalization
guarantees on the performance of the proposed caching strategy is derived. The
theoretical guarantee provides following insights on obtaining the caching
strategy: (i) run regret minimization at each sBS to obtain a sequence of
caching strategies across time, and (ii) maximize an estimate of the bound to
obtain a set of weights for the caching strategy which depends on the
discrepancy. Also, theoretical guarantee on the performance of the LRFU caching

evaluate state-of-the-art visual protection methods for privacy-preserving DNNs
in terms of visual security against ciphertext-only attacks (COAs). We focus on
brute-force attack, feature reconstruction attack (FR-Attack), inverse
transformation attack (ITN-Attack), and GAN-based attack (GAN-Attack), which
have been proposed to reconstruct visual information on plain images from the
visually-protected images. The detail of various attack is first summarized,
and then visual security of the protection methods is evaluated. Experimental
results demonstrate that most of protection methods, including pixel-wise
encryption, have not enough robustness against GAN-Attack, while a few
protection methods are robust enough against GAN-Attack.

  spectral analysis of Structured Matrices",,,"10.1016/j.laa.2022.06.017",,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A powerful tool for analyzing and approximating the singular values and
eigenvalues of structured matrices is the theory of GLT sequences. By the GLT
theory one can derive a function, which describes the singular value or the
eigenvalue distribution of the sequence, the latter under precise assumptions.
However, for small values of the matrix size of the considered sequence, the
approximations may not be as good as it is desirable, since in the construction
of the GLT symbol one disregards small norm and low-rank perturbations. On the
other hand, LFA can be used to construct polynomial symbols in a similar manner
for discretizations, where the geometric information is present, but the small
norm perturbations are retained. The main focus of this paper is the
introduction of the concept of sequence of ""Toeplitz momentary symbols"",
associated with a given sequence of truncated Toeplitz-like matrices. We
construct the symbol in the same way as in the GLT theory, but we keep the
information of the small norm contributions. The low-rank contributions are
still disregarded, and we give an idea on the reason why this is negligible in
certain cases and why it is not in other cases, being aware that in presence of
high nonnormality the same low-rank perturbation can produce a dramatic change
in the eigenvalue distribution. Moreover, a difference with respect to the LFA
symbols is that GLT symbols and Toeplitz momentary symbols are more general and
are applicable to a larger class of matrices. We show the applicability of the
approach which leads to higher accuracy in some cases when compared with the
GLT symbol. Finally, since for many applications and their analysis it is often
necessary to consider non-square Toeplitz matrices, we formalize and provide
some useful definitions, applicable for non-square Toeplitz momentary symbols.

  Annotations","EMNLP 2020 Fifth Conference on Machine Translation (WMT20)",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  When translating ""The secretary asked for details."" to a language with
grammatical gender, it might be necessary to determine the gender of the
subject ""secretary"". If the sentence does not contain the necessary
information, it is not always possible to disambiguate. In such cases, machine
translation systems select the most common translation option, which often
corresponds to the stereotypical translations, thus potentially exacerbating
prejudice and marginalisation of certain groups and people. We argue that the
information necessary for an adequate translation can not always be deduced
from the sentence being translated or even might depend on external knowledge.
Therefore, in this work, we propose to decouple the task of acquiring the
necessary information from the task of learning to translate correctly when
such information is available. To that end, we present a method for training
machine translation systems to use word-level annotations containing
information about subject's gender. To prepare training data, we annotate
regular source language words with grammatical gender information of the
corresponding target language words. Using such data to train machine
translation systems reduces their reliance on gender stereotypes when
information about the subject's gender is available. Our experiments on five
language pairs show that this allows improving accuracy on the WinoMT test set
by up to 25.8 percentage points.

differences in masses and charges of the up and down constituent quarks leads
to the isospin symmetry breaking. The isospin non-conservation affects broad
range of observables from superallowed Fermi weak interaction to
isospin-forbidden electromagnetic rates. Its most profound and cleanest
manifestation are systematic shifts in masses and excitation energies of mirror
atomic nuclei.
  Purpose: Recently, we constructed the charge-dependent DFT that includes
class II and III local interactions and demonstrated that the model allows for
very accurate reproduction of Mirror and Triplet Displacement energies in a
very broad range of masses. The aim of this work is to further test the
charge-dependent functional by studying Mirror Energy Differences (MEDs) in
function of angular momentum $I$.
  Methods: To compute MEDs we use DFT-rooted no core configuration interaction
model. This post mean-field method restores rotational symmetry and takes into
account configuration mixing within a space that includes relevant
(multi)particle-(multi)hole Slater determinants.
  Results: We applied the model to $f_{7/2}$-shell mirror pairs of $A=43$,
$45$, $47$, and $49$ focusing on MEDs in low-spin part (below band crossing)
what allowed us to limit the model space to seniority one and three (one broken
pair) configurations.
  Conclusions: We demonstrate that, for spins $I\leq 15/2$ being subject of the
present study, our model reproduces well experimental MEDs which vary strongly
in function of $I$ and $A$. The quality of model's predictions is comparable to
the nuclear shell-model results by Bentley et al. Phys. Rev. C 92, 024310

vendors and image quality. These distribution discrepancies could lead the deep
networks to over-fit on the training datasets and lack generalization ability
on the unseen test datasets. To alleviate this issue, we present a novel
Domain-oriented Feature Embedding (DoFE) framework to improve the
generalization ability of CNNs on unseen target domains by exploring the
knowledge from multiple source domains. Our DoFE framework dynamically enriches
the image features with additional domain prior knowledge learned from
multi-source domains to make the semantic features more discriminative.
Specifically, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Pool to learn and memorize the
prior information extracted from multi-source domains. Then the original image
features are augmented with domain-oriented aggregated features, which are
induced from the knowledge pool based on the similarity between the input image
and multi-source domain images. We further design a novel domain code
prediction branch to infer this similarity and employ an attention-guided
mechanism to dynamically combine the aggregated features with the semantic
features. We comprehensively evaluate our DoFE framework on two fundus image
segmentation tasks, including the optic cup and disc segmentation and vessel
segmentation. Our DoFE framework generates satisfying segmentation results on
unseen datasets and surpasses other domain generalization and network
regularization methods.

We detect the eleven rotational absorption lines of NH$_{2}$CH$_{2}$COOH

the choices made by human summarizers and annotators contain implicit
information about their background knowledge, we develop and compare techniques
for inferring background knowledge from summarization data. Based on this
framework, we define summary scoring functions that explicitly model background
knowledge, and show that these scoring functions fit human judgments
significantly better than baselines. We illustrate some of the many potential
applications of our framework. First, we provide insights into human
information importance priors. Second, we demonstrate that averaging the
background knowledge of multiple, potentially biased annotators or corpora
greatly improves summary-scoring performance. Finally, we discuss potential
applications of our framework beyond summarization.

there has been a lot of work in this area recently, most of the existing work
is based on image classification tasks. Video-based few-shot action recognition
has not been explored well and remains challenging: 1) the differences of
implementation details among different papers make a fair comparison difficult;
2) the wide variations and misalignment of temporal sequences make the
video-level similarity comparison difficult; 3) the scarcity of labeled data
makes the optimization difficult. To solve these problems, this paper presents
1) a specific setting to evaluate the performance of few-shot action
recognition algorithms; 2) an implicit sequence-alignment algorithm for better
video-level similarity comparison; 3) an advanced loss for few-shot learning to
optimize pair similarity with limited data. Specifically, we propose a novel
few-shot action recognition framework that uses long short-term memory
following 3D convolutional layers for sequence modeling and alignment. Circle
loss is introduced to maximize the within-class similarity and minimize the
between-class similarity flexibly towards a more definite convergence target.
Instead of using random or ambiguous experimental settings, we set a concrete
criterion analogous to the standard image-based few-shot learning setting for
few-shot action recognition evaluation. Extensive experiments on two datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Resolution is used by features such as type classes or Scala-style implicits to
synthesize values automatically from contextual type information. Subtyping is
commonly used to automatically convert the type of a value into another
compatible type. So far the two mechanisms have been considered independently
of each other. This paper shows that, with a small extension, subtyping with
intersection types can subsume resolution. This has three main consequences.
Firstly, resolution does not need to be implemented as a separate mechanism.
Secondly, the interaction between resolution and subtyping becomes apparent.
Finally, the integration of resolution into subtyping enables first-class
(implicit) environments. The extension that recovers the power of resolution
via subtyping is the modus ponens rule of propositional logic. While it is
easily added to declarative subtyping, significant care needs to be taken to
retain desirable properties, such as transitivity and decidability of
algorithmic subtyping, and coherence. To materialize these ideas we develop
$\lambda_i^{\mathsf{MP}}$, a calculus that extends a iprevious calculus with
disjoint intersection types, and develop its metatheory in the Coq theorem

complex and insidious clinical picture, electroencephalographic recordings
detect widespread oscillation disturbances (or oscillopathies). Neural
oscillations are electro-biomarkers of the connectivity state within systems. A
single systemic administration of ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA glutamate
receptor antagonist, transiently reproduces the oscillopathies with a clinical
picture reminiscent of the psychosis prodrome. This acute pharmacological model
may help the research and development of innovative treatments against the
psychotic transition. Transcranial electrical stimulation is recognized as an
appropriate non-invasive therapeutic modality since it can increase cognitive
performance and modulate neural oscillations with little or no side effects.
Therefore, our objective was to set up, in the sedated adult rat, a stimulation
method able to normalize the ketamine-induced oscillopathies. Unilateral
transcranial frontoparietal anodal stimulation by direct current (<+1 mA) was
applied in ketamine-treated rats. A concomitant electroencephalographic
recording of the parietal cortex measured the stimulation effects on its
spontaneously-occurring oscillations. A 5-min bipolar anodal tDCS immediately
and quickly reduced, significantly with an intensity-effect relationship, the
ketamine-induced oscillopathies at least in the bilateral parietal cortex. A
duration effect was also recorded. These preliminary neurophysiological
findings are promising for developing a therapeutic proof-of-concept against
neuropsychiatric disorders.

subject of much confusion in the literature, with redundant incorrect results.
The main objective of this paper is to clarify the main points of confusion and
remove any further ambiguity. The first part of the paper applies time-domain
methods, to derive for a first time, equivalent sequential characterizations of
the Cover and Pombra characterization of feedback capacity of AGN channels
driven by nonstationary and nonergodic Gaussian noise. The optimal channel
input processes of the new equivalent sequential characterizations are
expressed as functionals of a sufficient statistic and a Gaussian orthogonal
innovations process. From the new representations follows that the Cover and
Pombra $n-$block capacity formula is expressed as a functional of two
generalized matrix difference Riccati equations (DRE) of filtering theory of
Gaussian systems, contrary to results that appeared in the literature. In the
second part of the paper the existence of the asymptotic limit of the $n-$block
feedback capacity formula is shown to be equivalent to the convergence
properties of solutions of the two generalized DREs. Further, necessary and or
sufficient conditions are identified for existence of the asymptotic limits,
for stable and unstable Gaussian noise, when the optimal input distributions
are time-invariant, but not necessarily stationary. The paper contains an in
depth analysis, with examples, of the specific technical issues, which are

spectral method requires that the variables to be solved are continuous in

environment. A Chebyshev-Tau spectral method based on domain decomposition is
applied to the construction of underwater acoustic normal modes in this paper.
In this method, the differential equation is projected onto spectral space from
the original physical space with the help of an orthogonal basis of Chebyshev

particles dispersed in a viscous fluid with simultaneous reactions between the
components that constitute the solid and liquid phases. This process is of
particular importance for the simulation and control of secondary settling
tanks (SSTs) in water resource recovery facilities (WRRFs), formerly known as
wastewater treatment plants. A spatially one-dimensional model of reactive
settling in an SST is formulated by combining a mechanistic model of
sedimentation with compression with a model of biokinetic reactions. In
addition, the cross-sectional area of the tank is allowed to vary as a function
of height. The final model is a system of strongly degenerate parabolic,
nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs)that include discontinuous
coefficients to describe the feed, underflow and overflow mechanisms, as well
as singular source terms that model the feed mechanism. A finite difference
scheme for the final model is derived by first deriving a method-of-lines
formulation (discrete in space, continuous in time), and then passing to a
fully discrete scheme by a time discretization. The advantage of this
formulation is its compatibility with common practice in development of
software for WRRFs. The main mathematical result is an invariant-region
property, which implies that physically relevant numerical solutions are
produced. Simulations of denitrification in SSTs in wastewater treatment

major challenges in biomedical engineering and makes research in the field of
new and improved materials inevitable. However, current in-vitro test and
analysis methods are still lacking standardization and comparability, which
impedes advances in material design. For example, the optical platelet analysis
of material in-vitro hemocompatibility tests is carried out manually or
semi-manually by each research group individually.
  As a step towards standardization, this paper proposes an automation approach
for the optical platelet count and analysis. To this end, fluorescence images
are segmented using Zach's convexification of the multiphase-phase piecewise
constant Mumford--Shah model. The resulting connected components of the
non-background segments then need to be classified as platelet or no platelet.
Therefore, a supervised random forest is applied to feature vectors derived
from the components using features like area, perimeter and circularity. With
an overall high accuracy and low error rates, the random forest achieves
reliable results. This is supported by high areas under the receiver-operator
and the prediction-recall curve, respectively.
  We developed a new method for a fast, user-independent and reproducible
analysis of material hemocompatibility tests, which is therefore a unique and
powerful tool for advances in biomaterial research.

$sd$-shell nuclei exhibit strong admixtures of intruder configurations from the
$fp$ shell. The nucleus $^{30}$Mg, located at the boundary of the island of

approaches this region. Purpose: Spin-parity assignments for excited states in
$^{30}$Mg, especially negative-parity levels, have yet to be established. In
the present work, the nuclear structure of $^{30}$Mg was investigated by
in-beam $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy mainly focusing on firm spin-parity
determinations. Method: High-intensity rare-isotope beams of $^{31}$Mg,
$^{32}$Mg, $^{34}$Si, and $^{35}$P bombarded a Be target to induce nucleon
removal reactions populating states in $^{30}$Mg. $\gamma$ rays were detected
by the state-of-the-art $\gamma$-ray tracking array GRETINA. For the direct
one-neutron removal reaction, final-state exclusive cross sections and parallel
momentum distributions were deduced. Multi-nucleon removal reactions from
different projectiles were exploited to gain complementary information.
Results: With the aid of the parallel momentum distributions, an updated level
scheme with revised spin-parity assignments was constructed. Spectroscopic
factors associated with each state were also deduced. Conclusions: Results were
confronted with large-scale shell-model calculations using two different
effective interactions, showing excellent agreement with the present level
scheme. However, a marked difference in the spectroscopic factors indicates
that the full delineation of the transition into the island of inversion
remains a challenge for theoretical models.

  Networks","Accepted by COLING(2020)",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Text summarization aims to compress a textual document to a short summary
while keeping salient information. Extractive approaches are widely used in
text summarization because of their fluency and efficiency. However, most of
existing extractive models hardly capture inter-sentence relationships,
particularly in long documents. They also often ignore the effect of topical
information on capturing important contents. To address these issues, this
paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-based extractive summarization
model, enabling to capture inter-sentence relationships efficiently via
graph-structured document representation. Moreover, our model integrates a
joint neural topic model (NTM) to discover latent topics, which can provide
document-level features for sentence selection. The experimental results
demonstrate that our model not only substantially achieves state-of-the-art
results on CNN/DM and NYT datasets but also considerably outperforms existing
approaches on scientific paper datasets consisting of much longer documents,
indicating its better robustness in document genres and lengths. Further
discussions show that topical information can help the model preselect salient
contents from an entire document, which interprets its effectiveness in long
document summarization.

accretion of the Late Veneer, after the Moon-forming impact. We investigate how
the bombardment by planetesimals left-over from the terrestrial planet region
after terrestrial planet formation, as well as asteroids and comets, affects
the evolution of Earth's early atmosphere. We develop a new statistical code of
stochastic bombardment for atmosphere evolution, combining prescriptions for
atmosphere loss and volatile delivery derived from hydrodynamic simulations and
theory with results from dynamical modelling of realistic populations of
impactors. We find that for an initially Earth-like atmosphere impacts cause
moderate atmospheric erosion with stochastic delivery of large asteroids giving
substantial growth ($\times 10$) in a few $\%$ of cases. The exact change in
atmosphere mass is inherently stochastic and dependent on the dynamics of the
left-over planetesimals. We also consider the dependence on unknowns including
the impactor volatile content, finding that the atmosphere is typically
completely stripped by especially dry left-over planetesimals ($<0.02 ~ \%$
volatiles). Remarkably, for a wide range of initial atmosphere masses and
compositions, the atmosphere converges towards similar final masses and
compositions, i.e. initially low mass atmospheres grow whereas massive
atmospheres deplete. While the final properties are sensitive to the assumed
impactor properties, the resulting atmosphere mass is close to that of current
Earth. The exception to this is that a large initial atmosphere cannot be
eroded to the current mass unless the atmosphere was initially primordial in
composition.

behaviors called missions. While the skills are often programmed at a
relatively low level of abstraction, their coordination is architecturally
separated and often expressed in higher-level languages or frameworks.
Recently, the language of Behavior Trees gained attention among roboticists for
this reason. Originally designed for computer games to model autonomous actors,
Behavior Trees offer an extensible tree-based representation of missions.
However, even though, several implementations of the language are in use,
little is known about its usage and scope in the real world. How do behavior
trees relate to traditional languages for describing behavior? How are behavior
tree concepts used in applications? What are the benefits of using them?
  We present a study of the key language concepts in Behavior Trees and their
use in real-world robotic applications. We identify behavior tree languages and
compare their semantics to the most well-known behavior modeling languages:
state and activity diagrams. We mine open source repositories for robotics
applications that use the language and analyze this usage. We find that
Behavior Trees are a pragmatic language, not fully specified, allowing projects
to extend it even for just one model. Behavior trees clearly resemble the
models-at-runtime paradigm. We contribute a dataset of real-world behavior
models, hoping to inspire the community to use and further develop this
language, associated tools, and analysis techniques.

eigenfunctions in powers of the argument of the moment generating function
which particularly help to directly compute the cumulants and correlations
among local times spent at different locations. In particular, we obtain
explicit expressions of the mean, variance, and covariance of the local times

survival. In the absence of absorbing boundaries, we also study large
deviations of the local time and compute exact asymptotic forms of the

paper, we extend our study of the statistics of local time of the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle to the case not conditioned on survival. In this
case, one expects the distribution of the local time to reach a stationary
distribution in the large time limit. Computations of such stationary
distributions are known in the literature as the problem of first passage
functionals. In this paper, we study the approach to this stationary state with

SRI-SCK) into a recently developed Sparse Coding based Key-point detector
(SCK). The SCK detector is flexible in different scenarios and fully invariant
to affine intensity change, yet it is not designed to handle images with
drastic scale and rotation changes. In SRI-SCK, the scale invariance is
implemented with an image pyramid technique while the rotation invariance is
realized by combining multiple rotated versions of the dictionary used in the

second-order macrorotation-gradient and the micropolar antisymmetric shear
deformation. The shear deformable micropolar beam is reduced to a couple-stress

stretching-dominated beams, whereas the 6th-order micropolar model works for
bending-dominated beams as well. The 6th-order couple-stress beam is often too
stiff near point loads and boundaries. It is shown that the 1-D micropolar

avoiding a fixed set of patterns, we consider the limit of proportions of
consecutive patterns on large permutations of $\mathcal C$. These limits form a

  We determine the dimension of the consecutive patterns feasible region for
all families $\mathcal C$ closed either for the direct sum or the skew sum.
These families include for instance the ones avoiding a single pattern and all
substitution-closed classes. We further show that these regions are always

Here, we measure AMR of polycrystalline thin films of the standard ferromagnets
Co, Ni, Ni81Fe19 and Ni50Fe50 over the frequency range from DC to 28 THz. The
large bandwidth covers the regimes of both diffusive and ballistic intraband
electron transport and, thus, allows us to separate extrinsic and intrinsic AMR
components. Analysis of the THz response based on Boltzmann transport theory
reveals that the AMR of the Ni, Ni81Fe19 and Ni50Fe50 samples is of
predominantly extrinsic nature. However, the Co thin film exhibits a sizeable
intrinsic AMR contribution, which is constant up to 28 THz and amounts to more
than 2/3 of the DC AMR contrast of 1%. These features are attributed to the
hexagonal structure of the Co crystallites. They are interesting for
applications in terahertz spintronics and terahertz photonics. Our results show
that broadband terahertz electromagnetic pulses provide new and contact-free

vary through the solar activity cycle: frequencies, amplitudes, lifetimes,
energies. However, so far, the rates at which energy is supplied to the p modes
have not been detected to be sensitive to the level of magnetic activity. We
set out to re-inspect their temporal behaviour over the course of the last two
Schwabe cycles. For this, we use Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) p-mode
parameter tables. We analyse the energy supply rates for modes of harmonic
degrees $l=0\text{-}150$ and average over the azimuthal orders and,
subsequently, over modes in different parameter ranges. This averaging greatly
helps in reducing the noise in the data.We find that energy supply rates are
anti-correlated with the level of solar activity, for which we use the
$F_{10.7}$ index as a proxy. Modes of different mode frequency and harmonic
degrees show varying strengths of anti-correlation with the $F_{10.7}$ index,
reaching as low as $r=-0.82$ for low frequency modes with $l=101\text{-}150$.
In this first dedicated study of solar p-mode energy supply rates in GONG data,
we find that they do indeed vary through the solar cycle. Earlier
investigations with data from other instruments were hindered by being limited
to low harmonic degrees or by the data sets being too short. We provide tables
of time-averaged energy supply rates for individual modes as well as for

at the microsecond scale, otherwise replication becomes a burden. We propose
Mu, a system that takes less than 1.3 microseconds to replicate a (small)
request in memory, and less than a millisecond to fail-over the system - this
cuts the replication and fail-over latencies of the prior systems by at least
61% and 90%.
  Mu implements bona fide state machine replication/consensus (SMR) with strong
consistency for a generic app, but it really shines on microsecond apps, where
even the smallest overhead is significant. To provide this performance, Mu
introduces a new SMR protocol that carefully leverages RDMA. Roughly, in Mu a
leader replicates a request by simply writing it directly to the log of other
replicas using RDMA, without any additional communication. Doing so, however,
introduces the challenge of handling concurrent leaders, changing leaders,
garbage collecting the logs, and more - challenges that we address in this
paper through a judicious combination of RDMA permissions and distributed
algorithmic design.
  We implemented Mu and used it to replicate several systems: a financial
exchange app called Liquibook, Redis, Memcached, and HERD. Our evaluation shows
that Mu incurs a small replication latency, in some cases being the only viable
replication system that incurs an acceptable overhead.

models on 4 software frameworks and 2 operating systems without and with active
cooling. This comprehensive study was conducted on a low-cost edge platform,
namely Raspberry Pi 4B (RPi4B), under stable indoor conditions. The results
show that hysteresis-based active cooling prevented thermal throttling in all
cases, thereby improving the throughput up to approximately 90% versus no
cooling. Interestingly, the range of fan usage during active cooling varied
from 33% to 65%. Given the impact of the fan on the power consumption of the
system as a whole, these results stress the importance of a suitable selection
of CNN model and software components. To assess the performance in outdoor
applications, we integrated an external temperature sensor with the RPi4B and
conducted a set of experiments with no active cooling in a wide interval of
ambient temperature, ranging from 22 {\deg}C to 36 {\deg}C. Variations up to
27.7% were measured with respect to the maximum throughput achieved in that
interval. This demonstrates that ambient temperature is a critical parameter in
case active cooling cannot be applied.

because their high probabilities in wide ranges of external magnetic fields
which, in some cases, are even higher than that of usual atomic transitions.
Previously, the following rule was established: the intensities of MI
transitions with $\Delta F=\pm2$ are maximum when using respectively
$\sigma^\pm$ radiation. Within the same ground state, the difference in
intensity for $\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ radiations can be significant, leading
to magnetically induced circular dichroism (MCD), referred to as type-1. Here,

of both ionised and neutral species. Including partial ionisation leads to a
finite-width existing for shocks, where the ionised and neutral species
decouple and recouple. As such, drift velocities exist within the shock that
lead to frictional heating between the two species, in addition to the
adiabatic temperature changes across the shock. The local temperature
enhancements within the shock alter the recombination and ionisation rates and
hence change the composition of the plasma. We study the role of collisional
ionisation and recombination in slow-mode partially-ionised shocks. In
particular we incorporate the ionisation potential energy loss and analyse the
consequences of having a non-conservative energy equation. A semi-analytical
approach is used to determine the possible equilibrium shock jumps for a
two-fluid model with ionisation, recombination, ionisation potential and
arbitrary heating. Two-fluid numerical simulations are performed using the
(P\underline{I}P) code. Results are compared to the MHD model and semi-analytic
solution. Accounting for ionisation, recombination and ionisation potential
significantly alters the behaviour of shocks in both substructure and
post-shock regions. In particular, for a given temperature, equilibrium can
only exist for specific densities due to the radiative losses needing to be
balanced by the heating function. A consequence of the ionisation potential is
that a compressional shock will lead to a reduction of temperature in the
post-shock region, rather than the increase seen for MHD. The numerical
simulations pair well with the derived analytic model for shock velocities.

through ingenious modelling. For ASD, the so-called Jacobi-like methods have
been extensively used. However, the methods have no guarantee to suppress the
magnitude of off-diagonal entries of the transformed tuple even if the given
tuple has a common exact diagonalizer, i.e., the given tuple is simultaneously
diagonalizable. In this paper, to establish an alternative powerful strategy
for ASD, we present a novel two-step strategy, called
Approximate-Then-Diagonalize-Simultaneously (ATDS) algorithm. The ATDS
algorithm decomposes ASD into (Step 1) finding a simultaneously diagonalizable
tuple near the given one; and (Step 2) finding a common similarity
transformation which diagonalizes exactly the tuple obtained in Step 1. The
proposed approach to Step 1 is realized by solving a Structured Low-Rank
Approximation (SLRA) with Cadzow's algorithm. In Step 2, by exploiting the idea
in the constructive proof regarding the conditions for the exact simultaneous
diagonalizability, we obtain a common exact diagonalizer of the obtained tuple
in Step 1 as a solution for the original ASD. Unlike the Jacobi-like methods,
the ATDS algorithm has a guarantee to find a common exact diagonalizer if the
given tuple happens to be simultaneously diagonalizable. Numerical experiments
show that the ATDS algorithm achieves better performance than the Jacobi-like
methods.

electrodynamics with $N$-component complex scalar fields, i.e., the lattice
Abelian-Higgs model with noncompact gauge fields. For any $N\ge 2$, the phase
diagram shows three phases differing for the behavior of the scalar-field and
gauge-field correlations: the Coulomb phase (short-ranged scalar and
long-ranged gauge correlations), the Higgs phase (condensed scalar-field and
gapped gauge correlations), and the molecular phase (condensed scalar-field and
long-ranged gauge correlations). They are separated by three transition lines
meeting at a multicritical point. Their nature depends on the coexisting phases
and on the number $N$ of components of the scalar field. In particular, the
Coulomb-to-molecular transition line (where gauge correlations are irrelevant)
is associated with the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\Phi^4$ theory sharing the same
SU($N$) global symmetry but without explicit gauge fields. On the other hand,
the Coulomb-to-Higgs transition line (where gauge correlations are relevant)
turns out to be described by the continuum Abelian-Higgs field theory with
explicit gauge fields. Our numerical study is based on finite-size scaling
analyses of Monte Carlo simulations with $C^*$ boundary conditions (appropriate
for lattice systems with noncompact gauge variables, unlike periodic boundary
conditions), for several values of $N$, i.e., $N=2, 4, 10, 15$, and $25$. The
numerical results agree with the renormalization-group predictions of the
continuum field theories. In particular, the Coulomb-to-Higgs transitions are
continuous for $N\gtrsim 10$, in agreement with the predictions of the
Abelian-Higgs field theory.

be trained and stored. This work proposes a novel controllable Pareto
multi-task learning framework, to enable the system to make real-time trade-off

the MTL as a preference-conditioned multiobjective optimization problem, with a
parametric mapping from preferences to the corresponding trade-off solutions. A
single hypernetwork-based multi-task neural network is built to learn all tasks
with different trade-off preferences among them, where the hypernetwork
generates the model parameters conditioned on the preference. For inference,
MTL practitioners can easily control the model performance based on different
trade-off preferences in real-time. Experiments on different applications
demonstrate that the proposed model is efficient for solving various MTL

vertices into at most $k$ sets, so that each set induces a DAG. This well-known
problem is NP-hard, as it generalizes (undirected) $k$-Coloring, but becomes
trivial if the input digraph is acyclic. This poses the natural parameterized
complexity question what happens when the input is ""almost"" acyclic. In this
paper we study this question using parameters that measure the input's distance
to acyclicity in either the directed or the undirected sense.
  It is already known that, for all $k\ge 2$, $k$-Digraph Coloring is NP-hard
on digraphs of DFVS at most $k+4$. We strengthen this result to show that, for
all $k\ge 2$, $k$-Digraph Coloring is NP-hard for DFVS $k$. Refining our
reduction we obtain two further consequences: (i) for all $k\ge 2$, $k$-Digraph
Coloring is NP-hard for graphs of feedback arc set (FAS) at most $k^2$;
interestingly, this leads to a dichotomy, as we show that the problem is FPT by
$k$ if FAS is at most $k^2-1$; (ii) $k$-Digraph Coloring is NP-hard for graphs
of DFVS $k$, even if the maximum degree $\Delta$ is at most $4k-1$; we show
that this is also almost tight, as the problem becomes FPT for DFVS $k$ and
$\Delta\le 4k-3$.
  We then consider parameters that measure the distance from acyclicity of the
underlying graph. We show that $k$-Digraph Coloring admits an FPT algorithm
parameterized by treewidth, whose parameter dependence is $(tw!)k^{tw}$. Then,
we pose the question of whether the $tw!$ factor can be eliminated. Our main
contribution in this part is to settle this question in the negative and show
that our algorithm is essentially optimal, even for the much more restricted
parameter treedepth and for $k=2$. Specifically, we show that an FPT algorithm
solving $2$-Digraph Coloring with dependence $td^{o(td)}$ would contradict the
ETH.

Recognizing and discovering terrain characteristics is challenging because
similar terrains may have very different appearances (e.g., carpet comes in

different physical properties (e.g. mulch versus dirt). In order to address the
inherent ambiguity in vision-based terrain recognition and discovery, we
propose a multi-modal self-supervised learning technique that switches between
audio features extracted from a mic attached to the underside of a mobile

terrain types. The terrain cluster labels are then used to train an image-based

In particular, we are interested in rewriting for categorical settings with a
Cartesian structure, such as digital circuits. These are incompatible with
previous languages where the trace is constructed using a compact closed or
Frobenius structure, as combining these with Cartesian product can lead to
degenerate diagrams. Instead we must consider an approach where the trace is
constructed as an atomic operation. Interfaced linear hypergraphs are defined
as regular hypergraphs in which each vertex is the source and target of exactly
one edge each, equipped with an additional interface edge. The morphisms of a
freely generated STMC are interpreted as interfaced linear hypergraphs, up to
isomorphism (soundness). Moreover, any linear hypergraph is the representation
of a unique STMC morphism, up to the equational theory of the category
(completeness). This establishes interfaced linear hypergraphs as a suitable
combinatorial language for STMCs. We then show how we can apply the theory of
adhesive categories to our graphical language, meaning that a broad range of
equational properties of STMCs can be specified as a graph rewriting system.
The graphical language of digital circuits is presented as a case study.

standard photoluminescence (PL) with microscale lateral resolution is utilized
to identify and characterize these excitonic phenomena, including interlayer
excitons (IEXs). We studied the local PL signatures of van der Waals
heterobilayers composed of exfoliated monolayers of the (Mo,W)(S,Se)$_2$ TMDC
family with high spatial resolution (down to 30 nm) using tip-enhanced
photoluminescence (TEPL) with different orders (top/bottom) and on different
substrates. We evidence that other PL signals may appear near the reported
energy of the IEX transitions, possibly interfering in the interpretation of
the results. While we can distinguish and confirm the presence of IEX-related
PL in MoS$_2$-WS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$-WSe$_2$, we find no such feature in the

IEXs of this heterobilayer is often reported. We assign the extra signals to
the PL of the individual monolayers, in which the exciton energy is altered by
the local strains caused by the formation of blisters and nanobubbles, and the
PL is extremely enhanced due to the decoupling of the layers. We prove that
even a single nanobubble as small as 60 nm---hence not optically visible---can
induce such a suspicious PL feature in the micro-PL spectrum of an otherwise

investigated the existence and propagation characteristics of different wave

waves with phase speeds of ~20-30 km/s. The dominant wave mode seems to be the
fast kink wave mode; however, our analysis also suggests the existence of
localised Alfvenic torsional waves related to the dynamics of individual
chromospheric swirls that characterise the substructure of the vortex flow. The
Ha V-I phase difference analysis seems to imply the existence of a standing
wave pattern possibly arising from the interference of upwards propagating kink
waves with downwards propagating ones that are reflected at the transition
region or the corona. Moreover, the results provide further evidence that the
central chromospheric swirl drives the dynamics of the vortex flow. This is the
first exhaustive phase difference analysis within a vortex flow that explores
the nature and dynamics of different wave modes within it. The questions,
however, of whether, and how, the dissipation of the derived wave modes occurs

acceleration factors achieved by conventional parallel imaging techniques are
often inadequate. Further acceleration is possible using model-based
reconstruction. We propose a theoretical metric called TEUSQA: Time Efficiency
for UnderSampled QMRI Acquisitions to inform sequence design and sample pattern
optimisation. TEUSQA is designed for a particular class of reconstruction
techniques that directly estimate tissue parameters, possibly using prior
information to regularize the estimation. TEUSQA can be used to evaluate
undersampling patterns for multi-contrast QMRI sequences targeting any tissue
parameter. To verify the time efficiency predicted by TEUSQA, we performed
Monte Carlo simulations and an accelerated parameter mapping with two sequences
(Inversion prepared fast spin echo for T1 and T2 mapping and 3D GRASE for T2
and B0 inhomogeneity mapping). Using TEUSQA, we assessed several ways to
generate undersampling patterns in silico, providing insight into the relation
between sample distribution and time efficiency for different acceleration
factors. The time efficiency predicted by TEUSQA was within 15 % of that
observed in the Monte Carlo simulations and the prospective acquisition
experiment. The assessment of undersampling patterns showed that a class of
good patterns could be obtained by low-discrepancy sampling. We believe that
TEUSQA offers a valuable instrument for developers of novel QMRI sequences
pushing the boundaries of acceleration to achieve clinically feasible
protocols. Finally, we applied a time-efficient undersampling pattern selected
using TEUSQA for a 32-fold accelerated scan to map T1 and T2 mapping of a
healthy volunteer.

side chain equivalents are obtained from the 20 natural amino acids by
replacing the backbone part with a hydrogen atom, and discarding proline and
glycine that have special properties. A detailed analysis of the relative
solvation free energies suggests how it is possible to achieve a robust and
unambiguous hydrophobic scale for the amino acids. By discriminating the
relative contributions of the entropic and enthalpic terms, we find strong
negative correlations in water and ethanol, associated with the well-known
entropy-enthalpy compensation, and a much reduced correlation in cyclohexane.
This shows that in general the role of the polar and non-polar moieties cannot
be reversed in a non-polar solvent. Our findings are compared with past

Increasing the temperature, a number of vibrational bands close to the space

distinctive set of bands in the 288-329 cm-1 (300 K) range has a component
whose profile is carrier screened becoming nearly fully blurred in the
intermediate phase between ~830 K and ~1500 K. Below TC ~830 K this asymmetric

cell takes place revealing a delicate balance of long- and short-range
interactions. Ambient Raman scattering brings up evidence of a Fr\""ohlich
resonance due to Coulomb interactions between carriers and the macroscopic
field of the longitudinal optical phonon mode. We found it is dynamically
correlated to the hexagonal c-axis negative thermal expansion. Mid-infrared
(MIR) optical conductivity show that also plays a role in small polarons and
mediates in high temperature bipolarones.At higher temperatures a low frequency
Drude contribution is triggered by electron hopping signaling an
insulator-metal phase transition at ~1600 K while the MIR response suggests
coexistence between single small polarons and bipolarons. We draw a parallel
with improper ferroelectrics sustaining a lattice incommensurate intermediate

bilevel problems to mixed-integer linear programs make solving such problems
hard, which impedes their implementation in real-life. In this paper, we
significantly improve solution speed and tractability by introducing decision
trees to learn the active constraints of the lower-level problem, while
avoiding to introduce binaries and big-M constants. The application of machine
learning reduces the online solving time, by moving the selection of active
constraints to an offline process, and becomes particularly beneficial when the
same problem has to be solved multiple times. We apply our approach to the
strategic bidding of generators in electricity markets, where generators solve
the same problem many times for varying load demand or renewable production.
Three methods are developed and applied to the problem of a strategic
generator, with a DCOPF in the lower-level. These methods are heuristic and as
so, do not provide guarantees of optimality or solution quality. Yet, we show
that for networks of varying sizes, the computational burden is significantly
reduced, while we also manage to find solutions for strategic bidding problems

detector as the primary goal. At a threshold of ~50% of the mean of the
full-deposition peak, ~80% of the events were registered in a single pixel,
resulting in an effective position resolution of ~5 mm in X and Y. Lower
thresholds generally resulted in events demonstrating higher pixel
multiplicities, but these events could also be localized with ~5 mm position
resolution.

Collaborative video object segmentation by Foreground-Background Integration

object region and its corresponding background region, implicitly promoting
them to be more contrastive and improving the segmentation results accordingly.
Moreover, CFBI performs both pixel-level matching processes and instance-level
attention mechanisms between the reference and the predicted sequence, making
CFBI robust to various object scales. Based on CFBI, we introduce a multi-scale
matching structure and propose an Atrous Matching strategy, resulting in a more
robust and efficient framework, CFBI+. We conduct extensive experiments on two
popular benchmarks, i.e., DAVIS and YouTube-VOS. Without applying any simulated

The occurrence of the EP loop is due to the realness of the discriminant which
is guaranteed by the non-Hermitian chiral symmetry. The EPs at the four cusps
involve the coalescence of three eigenstates, which is the combined result of
the non-Hermitian chiral symmetry and mirror-T symmetry. The EP loop is exactly
an astroid in the limit of an infinitesimal non-Hermiticity. The EP loop
expands from the $M$ point with increasing non-Hermiticity and splits into two
EP loops at a critical non-Hermiticity. The further increase of non-Hermiticity
contracts the two EP loops towards and finally to two EPs at the $X$ and $Y$
points in the BZ, accompanied by the emergence of Dirac-like cones. The two EPs
vanish at a larger non-Hermiticity. The EP loop disappears and several discrete
EPs are found to survive when next-nearest hoppings are introduced to break the
non-Hermitian chiral symmetry. A topological invariant called the discriminant

success in learning sequence representations, especially for natural language

recover the original input. However, such pre-training approaches are prone to
learning representations that are covariant with the noise, leading to the

unsupervised instance-wise training signals. In this way, it not only
alleviates the pretrain-finetune discrepancy induced by the noise of

corona, we analyzed ultraviolet (UV) spectral line observations acquired on
both the east and west limbs at 1.7 $R_{\odot}$ by SOHO/UVCS during the solar
minimum preceding solar cycle 23. To obtain a reliable and statistically robust
picture of the rotational profile, we used a set of simultaneous 400-day long
spectral line intensities of five different spectral lines: O VI 1032 A, O VI
1037 A, Si XII 499 A, Si XII 521 A, and H I 1216 A, which are routinely
observed by UVCS. The data were analyzed by means of two different techniques:
the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram (GLS) and a multivariate data-adaptive
technique called multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA). Among many
other positive outcomes, this latter method is unique in its ability to
recognize common oscillatory modes between the five time series observed at
both limbs. The latitudinal rotation profile obtained in this work emphasizes
that the low-latitude region of the UV corona (about $\pm 20^{\circ}$ from the
solar equator) exhibits differential rotation, while the higher-latitude
structures do rotate quasi-rigidly. The differential rotation rate of the solar
corona as evinced at low-latitudes is consistent with the rotational profile of
the near-surface convective zone of the Sun, suggesting that the rotation of
the corona at 1.7 $R_{\odot}$ is linked to intermediate-scale magnetic bipole
structures anchored near 0.99 $R_{\odot}$. The quasi-rigid rotation rate found
at mid and high latitudes is instead attributed to the influence of large-scale
coronal structures linked to the rigidly rotating coronal holes. We further
suggest that the methodology presented in this paper could represent a
milestone for future investigations on differential rotation rates when dealing
with simultaneous multiwavelength data.

Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) framework, which consists of three branches to infer
the emotional state of the new body gestures with only their semantic
descriptions. The first branch is a Prototype-Based Detector (PBD) which is
used to determine whether an sample belongs to a seen body gesture category and
obtain the prediction results of the samples from the seen categories. The
second branch is a Stacked AutoEncoder (StAE) with manifold regularization,
which utilizes semantic representations to predict samples from unseen
categories. Note that both of the above branches are for body gesture
recognition. We further add an emotion classifier with a softmax layer as the

learned by a shared feature extraction network, i.e., a Bidirectional Long

three branches as subtasks and use multi-task learning strategies for joint
training. The performance of our framework on an emotion recognition dataset is

synergy with RRLs. We adopted new and existing optical and Near-Infrared (NIR)

diagram, Bailey diagram, Fourier decomposition of the light curve, amplitude
ratios) for their empirical separation. We found that the classical period
threshold at 1 day is not universal and does not dictate the evolutionary
stage: V92 has a period of 1.3 days but is likely to be still in its core
Helium-burning phase, typical of RRLs. We also derived NIR Period-Luminosity
relations and found a distance modulus of 13.65$\pm$0.07 (err.)$\pm$0.01

RRLs and T2Cs obey the same PL relations in the NIR. This equivalence gives the
opportunity to adopt RRLs+T2Cs as an alternative to classical Cepheids to
calibrate the extragalactic distance scale.

information processing. With this aim, quantum reservoir computing (QRC) with
Ising spin networks was recently introduced as a quantum version of classical
reservoir computing. In turn, reservoir computing is a neuro-inspired machine
learning technique that consists in exploiting dynamical systems to solve
nonlinear and temporal tasks. We characterize the performance of the spin-based
QRC model with the Information Processing Capacity (IPC), which allows to
quantify the computational capabilities of a dynamical system beyond specific
tasks. The influence on the IPC of the input injection frequency, time
multiplexing, and different measured observables encompassing local spin
measurements as well as correlations, is addressed. We find conditions for an
optimum input driving and provide different alternatives for the choice of the
output variables used for the readout. This work establishes a clear picture of
the computational capabilities of a quantum network of spins for reservoir
computing. Our results pave the way to future research on QRC both from the
theoretical and experimental points of view.

threefold and builds on a textual critique of this methodology. First, OSSTMM's
central principle is that security can be understood as a quantity of which an
entity has more or less. We show why this is wrong and how OSSTMM's unified
security score, the rav, is an empty abstraction. Second, OSSTMM disregards
risk by replacing it with a trust metric which confuses multiple definitions of
trust and, as a result, produces a meaningless score. Finally, OSSTMM has been

as a security threat that needs to be constantly monitored and controlled.
Thus, we argue that OSSTMM is neither fit for purpose nor can it be salvaged,

thermal and nuclear pairing effects are taken into account in the description
of nuclear properties and in the finite temperature proton-neutron relativistic
quasiparticle random-phase approximation (FT-PNRQRPA) to calculate the relevant
allowed and first-forbidden transitions in the $\beta$-decay. The temperature
and density effects are studied on the $\beta$-decay half-lives between
temperatures $T = 0-1.5$ MeV, and at densities $\rho Y_e = 10^7$ g/cm${}^3$ and
$10^9$ g/cm${}^3$. The relevant Gamow-Teller transitions are also investigated
for Ti, Fe, Cd, and Sn isotopic chains at finite temperatures. We find that the
$\beta$-decay half-lives increase with increasing density $\rho Y_e$, whereas
half-lives generally decrease with increasing temperature. It is shown that the
temperature effects decrease the half-lives considerably in nuclei with longer
half-lives at zero temperature, while only slight changes for nuclei with short
half-lives are obtained. We also show the importance of including the
de-excitation transitions in the calculation of the $\beta$-decay half-lives at
finite temperatures. Comparing the FT-PNQRPA results with the shell-model
calculations for $pf-$shell nuclei, a reasonable agreement is obtained for the
temperature dependence of $\beta$-decay rates. Finally, large-scale

assessment of the occurrence and properties of small-scale dynamical features

resolution ~ $1.4$ - $2.1$ arcsec and a duration of ~ $40$ min are analysed

studied to detect pronounced dynamical features which are connected to
dynamical events via a k-means clustering algorithm. The physical properties of
the resulting events are studied and it is explored if they show properties
consistent with propagating shock waves. For this purpose, observable shock
wave signatures at mm wavelengths are calculated from one- and
three-dimensional model atmospheres. There are 552 dynamical events detected
with an excess in brightness temperature ($\Delta T_\text{b}$) of at least
$\geq 400$ K. The events show a large variety in size up to ~ $9$ arcsec,
amplitude $\Delta T_\text{b}$ up to ~ $1200$ K with typical values between ~
$450$ - $750$ K and lifetime at FWHM of $\Delta T_\text{b}$ between ~ $43$ -
$360$ s, with typical values between ~ $55$ - $125$ s. Furthermore, many of the
events show signature properties that suggest that they are likely produced by
propagating shock waves. There are a lot of small-scale dynamic structures
detected in the Band 3 data, even though the spatial resolution sets
limitations of the size of events that can be detected. The amount of dynamic
signatures in the ALMA mm data is very low in areas with photospheric
footpoints with stronger magnetic fields, which is consistent with the

present day across multiple domains including industry and educational
institutions. Understanding sentiments being expressed in an email could have a
considerable impact on the recipients' action or response to the email.
However, it is difficult to interpret emotions of the sender from pure text in
which emotions are not explicitly present. Researchers have tried to predict
customer attrition by integrating emails in client-company environment with
emotions. However, most of the existing works deal with static assessment of
email emotions. Presenting sentiments of emails dynamically to the reader could
help in understanding senders' emotion and as well have an impact on readers'
action. Hence, in this paper, we present EmoG as a Google Chrome Extension
which is intended to support university students. It augments emails with
emojis based on the sentiment being conveyed in the email, which might also
offer faster overview of email sentiments and act as tags that could help in
automatic sorting and processing of emails. Currently, EmoG has been developed
to support Gmail inbox on a Google Chrome browser, and could be extended to
other inboxes and browsers with ease. We have conducted a user survey with 15
university students to understand the usefulness of EmoG and received positive
feedback.

browser. Hundreds of attributes have been discovered through the years. Each
one of them provides a way to distinguish browsers, but also comes with a
usability cost (e.g., additional collection time). In this work, we propose
FPSelect, an attribute selection framework allowing verifiers to tune their
browser fingerprinting probes for web authentication. We formalize the problem
as searching for the attribute set that satisfies a security requirement and
minimizes the usability cost. The security is measured as the proportion of
impersonated users given a fingerprinting probe, a user population, and an
attacker that knows the exact fingerprint distribution among the user
population. The usability is quantified by the collection time of browser
fingerprints, their size, and their instability. We compare our framework with
common baselines, based on a real-life fingerprint dataset, and find out that
in our experimental settings, our framework selects attribute sets of lower
usability cost. Compared to the baselines, the attribute sets found by FPSelect
generate fingerprints that are up to 97 times smaller, are collected up to
3,361 times faster, and with up to 7.2 times less changing attributes between
two observations, on average.

and perform well in engineering applications, yet their uptake in industry
remains limited. In order to understand why this is the case, the opinions of
users of engineering design tools were gathered. The results from a survey
showing the attitudes of engineers and students with design experience with
respect to optimisation algorithms are presented. A survey was designed to
answer two research questions: To what extent is there a pre-existing sentiment
(negative or positive) among students, engineers, and managers towards genetic
algorithm-based design? and What are the requirements of practitioners with
regards to design optimisation and the design optimisation process? A total of
23 participants (N = 23) took part in the 3-part mixed methods survey. Thematic
analysis was conducted on the open-ended questions. A common thread throughout
participants responses is that there is a question of trust towards genetic
algorithms within industry. Perhaps surprising is that the key to gaining this
trust is not producing good results, but creating algorithms which explain the
process they take in reaching a result. Participants have expressed a desire to
continue to remain in the design loop. This is at odds with the motivation of a
portion of the genetic algorithms community of removing humans from the loop.
It is clear we need to take a different approach to increase industrial uptake.
Based on this, the following recommendations have been made to increase their
use in industry: an increase of transparency and explainability of genetic
algorithms, an increased focus on user experience, better communication between
developers and engineers, and visualising algorithm behaviour.

detection. The goal is to measure by appropriate patterns the speed of
formation and disintegration of groups in the crowd. This descriptor is
inspired by the concept of one-dimensional local binary patterns: in our case,
such patterns depend on the number of group observed in a time window. An
appropriate measurement unit, named ""trit"" (trinary digit), represents three
possible dynamic states of groups on a certain frame. Our hypothesis is that
abrupt variations of the groups' number may be due to an anomalous event that
can be accordingly detected, by translating these variations on temporal
trit-based sequence of strings which are significantly different from the one
describing the ""no-anomaly"" one. Due to the peculiarity of the rationale behind
this work, relying on the number of groups, three different methods of people
group's extraction are compared. Experiments are carried out on the
Motion-Emotion benchmark data set. Reported results point out in which cases
the trit-based measurement of group dynamics allows us to detect the anomaly.
Besides the promising performance of our approach, we show how it is correlated
with the anomaly typology and the camera's perspective to the crowd's flow

available and are useful for describing functional connectivity (FC), the
relatedness of neuronal activity in regions of the brain. This FC of the brain
provides insight into certain neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric
disorders, and thus is of clinical importance. To help inform physicians
regarding patient diagnoses, unsupervised clustering of subjects based on FC is
desired, allowing the data to inform us of groupings of patients based on
shared features of connectivity. Since heterogeneity in FC is present even
between patients within the same group, it is important to allow subject-level
differences in connectivity, while still pooling information across patients
within each group to describe group-level FC. To this end, we propose a random
covariance clustering model (RCCM) to concurrently cluster subjects based on
their FC networks, estimate the unique FC networks of each subject, and to
infer shared network features. Although current methods exist for estimating FC
or clustering subjects using fMRI data, our novel contribution is to cluster or
group subjects based on similar FC of the brain while simultaneously providing
group- and subject-level FC network estimates. The competitive performance of
RCCM relative to other methods is demonstrated through simulations in various
settings, achieving both improved clustering of subjects and estimation of FC
networks. Utility of the proposed method is demonstrated with application to a
resting-state fMRI data set collected on 43 healthy controls and 61

such as electronics, biology, ecology, and economics. In population biology,
deterministic methods of bifurcation are commonly used. In contrast, stochastic
bifurcation techniques are infrequently employed. Here we establish stochastic
P-bifurcation behavior of (i) a growth model with state-dependent birth rate
and constant death rate, and (ii) a logistic growth model with state-dependent
carrying capacity, both of which are driven by multiplicative symmetric stable
Levy noise. Transcritical bifurcation occurs in the deterministic counterpart
of the first model, while saddle-node bifurcation takes place in the logistic
growth model. We focus on the impact of the variations of the growth rate, the
per capita daily adult mortality rate, the stability index, and the noise
intensity on the stationary probability density functions of the associated
non-local Fokker-Planck equation. In the first model, the bifurcation parameter
is the ratio of the population birth rate to the population death rate. In the
second model, the bifurcation parameter corresponds to the sensitivity of
carrying capacity to change in the size of the population near equilibrium. In
each case, we show that as the value of the bifurcation parameter increases,
the shape of the steady-state probability density function changes and that
both stochastic models exhibit stochastic P-bifurcation. The unimodal density
functions become more peaked around deterministic equilibrium points as the
stability index increases. While an increase in any one of the other parameters
has an effect on the stationary probability density function. That means the
geometry of the density function changes from unimodal to flat, and its peak
appears in the middle of the domain, which means a transition occurs.

is affected by two factors that derive from user interactions with virtual

conducted where these two factors are manipulated by making participants
believe they are interacting with the smart speaker ""Amazon Echo"". Intrinsic
motivation is measured both by using questionnaires and by covertly monitoring
a five-minute free-choice period in the experimenter's absence, during which
the participants could decide for themselves whether to interact with the
virtual assistants. Results of the first experiment showed that high
expectation engenders more intrinsically motivated interaction compared with
low expectation. The results also suggested suppressive effects by uncertainty
on intrinsic motivation, though we had not hypothesized before experiments. We
then revised our hypothetical model of action selection accordingly and
conducted a verification experiment of uncertainty's effects. Results of the
verification experiment showed that reducing uncertainty encourages more
interactions and causes the motivation behind these interactions to shift from

on polymer substrates, mimicking, for example, RNA polymerase on DNA or kinesin
on microtubules. The polymer is modeled as a connected chain of beads; motors
are represented as freely diffusing beads which, upon encountering the
substrate, bind to it through a short-ranged attractive potential. When bound,
motors and polymer beads experience an equal and opposite active force,
directed tangential to the polymer; this leads to motion of the motors along
the polymer contour. The inclusion of explicit motors differentiates our model
from other recent active polymer models. We study, by means of Langevin
dynamics simulations, the effect of the motor activity on both the
conformational and dynamical properties of the substrate. We find that activity
leads, in addition to the expected enhancement of polymer diffusion, to an
effective reduction of its persistence length. We discover that this effective
""softening"" is a consequence of the emergence of double-folded branches, or
hairpins, and that it can be tuned by changing the number of motors or the
force they generate. Finally, we investigate the effect of the motors on the
probability of knot formation. Counter-intuitively our simulations reveal that,
even though at equilibrium a more flexible substrate would show an increased
knotting probability, motor activity leads to a marked decrease in the
occurrence of knotted conformations with respect to equilibrium.

In this study, we present for the first time two objects that were never
discussed as GRGs before and propose a new candidate GRG. We confirm the
correlation between the X-ray luminosity and the radio core luminosity found
for other soft gamma-ray selected GRGs and expected for AGNs powered by
efficient accretion. We also corroborate previous results that indicate that
the luminosity of the radio lobes is relatively low compared with the nuclear
X-ray emission. This supports the idea that the nucleus of these GRGs is now
more powerful than in the past, consistent with a restarting activity scenario

any two of its points is uniformly bounded below by a strictly positive
constant and such that (b) the distance from any point to the remaining points
in the set is uniformly bounded above. Delone sets are thus sets of points
enjoying nice spacing properties, and appear therefore naturally in
mathematical models for quasicrystals.
  Define a spiral set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ as a set of points of the form
$\left\{\sqrt[n]{k}\cdot\boldsymbol{u}_k\right\}_{k\ge 1}$, where
$\left(\boldsymbol{u}_k\right)_{k\ge 1}$ is a sequence in the unit sphere
$\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$. In the planar case $n=2$, spiral sets serve as natural
theoretical models in phyllotaxis (the study of configurations of leaves on a
plant stem), and an important example in this class includes the sunflower
spiral.
  Recent works by Akiyama, Marklof and Yudin provide a reasonable complete
characterisation of planar spiral sets which are also Delone. A related problem
that has emerged in several places in the literature over the past fews years
is to determine whether this theory can be extended to higher dimensions, and
in particular to show the existence of spiral Delone sets in any dimension.
  This paper addresses this question by characterising the Delone property of a
spiral set in terms of packing and covering conditions satisfied by the
spherical sequence $\left(\boldsymbol{u}_k\right)_{k\ge 1}$. This allows for
the construction of explicit examples of spiral Delone sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$
for all $n\ge 2$, which boils down to finding a sequence of points in
$\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ enjoying some optimal distribution properties.

on baseline risk as a robust predictor of treatment effect and provided
guidance on risk-based assessment of treatment effect heterogeneity in the RCT

consists of five steps: 1) definition of the research aim, i.e., the
population, the treatment, the comparator and the outcome(s) of interest; 2)
identification of relevant databases; 3) development of a prediction model for
the outcome(s) of interest; 4) estimation of relative and absolute treatment
effect within strata of predicted risk, after adjusting for observed
confounding; 5) presentation of the results. We demonstrate our framework by
evaluating heterogeneity of the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
inhibitors versus beta blockers on three efficacy and six safety outcomes
across three observational databases. The proposed framework can supplement any
comparative effectiveness study. We provide a publicly available R software
package for applying this framework to any database mapped to the Observational
Medical Outcomes Partnership Common Data Model. In our demonstration, patients
at low risk of acute myocardial infarction received negligible absolute
benefits for all three efficacy outcomes, though they were more pronounced in
the highest risk quarter, especially for hospitalization with heart failure.
However, failing diagnostics showed evidence of residual imbalances even after
adjustment for observed confounding. Our framework allows for the evaluation of
differential treatment effects across risk strata, which offers the opportunity
to consider the benefit-harm trade-off between alternative treatments.

10,000 light rays. Using an approximate form of the Fresnel equations we
measured how much of the incident light was reflected. Having repeated this
algorithm on varying surface roughnesses we find the spherical albedo as a
function of the Hurst exponent, the geochemical composition of the magma, and
the wavelength. As a proof of concept, we used our model on Kepler-10b to
demonstrate the applicability of our approach. We present the spherical albedo
values produced from different lava compositions and multiple tests that can be
applied to observational data in order to determine their characteristics.
Currently, there is a strong degeneracy in the surface composition of AMOPs due
to the large uncertainties in their measured spherical albedos. In spite of
this, when applied to Kepler-10b we show that its high albedo could be caused
by a moderately wavy ocean that is rich in oxidised metallic species such as
FeO, $\rm Fe_{2}O_{3}$, $\rm Fe_{3}O_{4}$. This would imply that Kepler-10b is

population that occupies dynamically undisturbed orbits around the Sun, and as
such, is a primitive object that formed in situ. Therefore, whether its shape
is primordial or evolutionary carries important implications for understanding
the evolution of both KBOs and potentially their dynamically derived objects,
Centaurs and Jupiter Family Comets (JFC). Applying our mass loss driven shape
evolution model (MONET), here we suggest that the current shape of Arrokoth
could be of evolutionary origin due to volatile outgassing in a timescale of
about 1 to 100 Myr, while its spin state would not significantly affected. We
further argue that such a process may be ubiquitous in the evolution of the
shape of KBOs shortly after their formation. This shape changing process could
also be reactivated when KBOs dynamically evolve to become Centaurs and then
JFCs and receive dramatically increased solar heating.

challenging during the automatic diagnosis process. The multi-instance learning
based on the most discriminative instances can be of great benefit for whole

We first select the discriminative instances, and then utilize these instances

network is capable of capturing instance-wise dependencies and recalibrating
instance features according to the importance coefficient learned from the
fused features. Furthermore, we build a large whole-slide gastric

Experimental results on the constructed gastric dataset demonstrate the

optimization of best prospect superconductors (SC) such as conventional

pressure (HP) is very challenging, and there is not a proved route to achieve
it in a controlled fashion. Aided by computing simulations, we show that it may
be plausible to start by alloying primary materials and subsequently
incorporate high ratios of hydrogen at moderates pressures ($\approx$1.5 Mbar).
Our theoretical results evidence the possibility to tune the electronic
structure of LaH$_{10}$, increase the density of states at the Fermi level by
doping of various elements and hence change their superconducting properties.
We found aluminium to increase the occupation at the Fermi level by more than
30 %. Incorporation of other elements such as Si, Ge, H, Ir, Ca, and others
with a varying percentage also play in favour to tune the electronic structure.
More importantly, these predictions lie in experimentally attainable doping
levels. Also, for the first time, we shed light on how the formation of defects
and vacancies influence on the electronic structure of a HP-hydride
superconductor. The concepts presented in this work can be extended to other
high-pressure, hydrogen-based superconductors such as H$_3$S. Arguably, doping

to an accelerated frame, which introduces a constant gravitational field into
the system and subsequently. We consider the addition of a linear contribution
to the gravitational potential \(\phi \) which can be used to cancel the
gravitational field induced by going to the accelerated from, the combination
of these two operations produces then a symmetry. This symmetry leads then to a
Noether current which is conserved. The conserved charges are analyzed in
special cases. The charges may not be conserved if the Noether current produces
flux at infinity, but such flux can be eliminated by going to the CM (center of
mass) system in the case of an isolated system. In the CM frame the Noether
charge vanishes, Then we study connection between the Cosmological Principle
and the Newtonian Dynamics which was formulated via a symmetry (Benisty and
Guendelman in Mod Phys Lett A 35:2050131, 2020) of this type, but without an
action formulation. Homogeneous behavior for the coordinate system relevant to
cosmology leads to a zero Noether current and the requirement of the Newtonian
potential to be invariant under the symmetry in this case yields the Friedmann
equations, which appear as a consistency condition for the symmetry.

applying out-of-plane fields, we find a critical scaling behaviour of the
magnetic susceptibility expected for the BKT transition. The experimental
findings can be explained by quantum Monte Carlo simulations applied on an
accurate triangular-lattice Ising model of the compound which hosts a BKT

of radiation emitted from an electron-beam (e-beam) evaporator and how the
amount of radiation depends on different deposition parameters and conditions,
we highlight two phenomena in more detail: First, we discuss an unintentional
shadow evaporation beneath the undercut of a resist layer caused by the one
part of the metal vapor which got ionized by electron-impact ionization. These
ions first lead to an unintentional build-up of charges on the sample, which in
turn results in an electrostatic deflection of subsequently incoming ionized
metal atoms towards the undercut of the resist. Second, we show how low-energy
secondary electrons during the metallization process can cause cross-linking,
blisters, and bubbles in the respective resist layer used for defining micro-
and nanostructures in an e-beam lithography process. After the metal
deposition, the cross-linked resist may lead to significant problems in the
lift-off process and causes leftover residues on the device. We provide a
troubleshooting guide on how to minimize these effects, which e.g. includes the
correct alignment of the e-beam, the avoidance of contaminations in the
crucible and, most importantly, the installation of deflector electrodes within
the evaporation chamber.

text ranking is search, instances of the task can also be found in many natural
language processing applications. This survey provides an overview of text
ranking with neural network architectures known as transformers, of which BERT
is the best-known example. The combination of transformers and self-supervised
pretraining has been responsible for a paradigm shift in natural language
processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and beyond. In this survey, we
provide a synthesis of existing work as a single point of entry for
practitioners who wish to gain a better understanding of how to apply
transformers to text ranking problems and researchers who wish to pursue work
in this area. We cover a wide range of modern techniques, grouped into two
high-level categories: transformer models that perform reranking in multi-stage
architectures and dense retrieval techniques that perform ranking directly.
There are two themes that pervade our survey: techniques for handling long
documents, beyond typical sentence-by-sentence processing in NLP, and
techniques for addressing the tradeoff between effectiveness (i.e., result
quality) and efficiency (e.g., query latency, model and index size). Although
transformer architectures and pretraining techniques are recent innovations,
many aspects of how they are applied to text ranking are relatively well
understood and represent mature techniques. However, there remain many open
research questions, and thus in addition to laying out the foundations of
pretrained transformers for text ranking, this survey also attempts to
prognosticate where the field is heading.

sexual harassment and violence. While #MeToo has been praised for providing
support for self-disclosures of harassment or violence and shifting societal
response, it has also been criticized for exemplifying how women of color have
been discounted for their historical contributions to and excluded from
feminist movements. Through an analysis of over 600,000 tweets from over
256,000 unique users, we examine online #MeToo conversations across gender and
racial/ethnic identities and the topics that each demographic emphasized. We
found that tweets authored by white women were overrepresented in the movement
compared to other demographics, aligning with criticism of unequal
representation. We found that intersected identities contributed differing
narratives to frame the movement, co-opted the movement to raise visibility in
parallel ongoing movements, employed the same hashtags both critically and
supportively, and revived and created new hashtags in response to pivotal
moments. Notably, tweets authored by black women often expressed emotional
support and were critical about differential treatment in the justice system
and by police. In comparison, tweets authored by white women and men often
highlighted sexual harassment and violence by public figures and weaved in more
general political discussions. We discuss the implications of work for digital
activism research and design including suggestions to raise visibility by those
who were under-represented in this hashtag activism movement. Content warning:

stars. The stars' Fe/Si distribution is close to a Gaussian distribution
$1.63^{+0.91}_{-0.85}$, while the planets' distribution peaks at lower values
and has a longer tail, $1.15^{+1.43}_{-0.76}$. It is easier to see the
discrepancy in cmf space, where primordial stellar composition is
$0.32^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$, while rocky planets' follow a broader distribution
$0.24^{+0.33}_{-0.18}$. (2) We introduce uncompressed density
($\overline{\rho_0}$ at reference pressure/temperature) as a metric to compare
compositions. With this, we find what seems to be the maximum iron enrichment
that rocky planets attain during formation ($\overline{\rho_0}$ ~ 6 and cmf ~
0.8). (3) Highly irradiated planets exhibit a large range of compositions. If
these planets are the result of atmospheric evaporation, iron enrichment and
perhaps depletion must happen before gas dispersal. And (4), we identify a
group of highly-irradiated planets that, if rocky, would be 2-fold depleted in

goal to contain an infection that spreads in a network. Instead of selecting
the single most important node, this paper deals with the problem of selecting
multiple nodes for removal. As compared to previous work on multiple-node
selection, the trade-off between cost and benefit is considered. The benefit is
measured in terms of increasing the epidemic threshold which is a measure of
how difficult it is for an infection to spread in a network. The cost is
measured in terms of the number and size of nodes to be removed or controlled.
Already in its single-objective instance with a fixed number of $k$ nodes to be
removed, the multiple vertex immunisation problems have been proven to be
NP-hard. Several heuristics have been developed to approximate the problem. In
this work, we compare meta-heuristic techniques with exact methods on the
Shield-value, which is a sub-modular proxy for the maximal eigenvalue and used
in the current state-of-the-art greedy node-removal strategies. We generalise
it to the multi-objective case and replace the greedy algorithm by a quadratic
program (QP), which then can be solved with exact QP solvers. The main
contribution of this paper is the insight that, if time permits, exact and
problem-specific methods approximation should be used, which are often far
better than Pareto front approximations obtained by general meta-heuristics.
Based on these, it will be more effective to develop strategies for controlling
real-world networks when the goal is to prevent or contain epidemic outbreaks.

turbulent diffusion in comb geometry are considered. The interplay between the
backbone inhomogeneous advection $\delta(y)x\partial_x$ along the $x$ axis,
which takes place only at the $y=0$, and normal diffusion inside fingers
$\partial_y^2$ along the $y$ axis leads to turbulent diffusion. This
geometrical constraint of transport coefficients due to comb geometry and
properties of a dilatation operator lead to consideration of two possible
scenarios of quantum mechanics. These two variants of continuous time quantum
walks are described by non-Hermitian operators of the form $\hat{\cal
H}=\hat{A}+i\hat{B}$. Operator $\hat{A}$ is responsible for the unitary
transformation, while operator $i\hat{B}$ is responsible for quantum/classical
relaxation. At the first quantum scenario, the initial wave packet can move
against the classical streaming. This quantum swimming upstream is due to the
dilatation operator, which is responsible for the quantum (not unitary)
dynamics along the backbone, while the classical relaxation takes place in
fingers. In the second scenario, the dilatation operator is responsible for the
quantum relaxation in the form of an imaginary optical potential, while the
quantum unitary dynamics takes place in fingers. Rigorous analytical analysis
is performed for both wave and Green's functions.

reason over sequential tasks in high-dimensional state spaces with complex
dynamics. Classical motion planning algorithms, such as rapidly-exploring
random trees, are capable of efficiently exploring large state spaces and
computing long-horizon, sequential plans. However, these algorithms are
generally challenged with complex, stochastic, and high-dimensional state
spaces as well as in the presence of narrow passages, which naturally emerge in
tasks that interact with the environment. Machine learning offers a promising
solution for its ability to learn general policies that can handle complex
interactions and high-dimensional observations. However, these policies are
generally limited in horizon length. Our approach, Broadly-Exploring,
Local-policy Trees (BELT), merges these two approaches to leverage the
strengths of both through a task-conditioned, model-based tree search. BELT
uses an RRT-inspired tree search to efficiently explore the state space.
Locally, the exploration is guided by a task-conditioned, learned policy
capable of performing general short-horizon tasks. This task space can be quite
general and abstract; its only requirements are to be sampleable and to
well-cover the space of useful tasks. This search is aided by a
task-conditioned model that temporally extends dynamics propagation to allow
long-horizon search and sequential reasoning over tasks. BELT is demonstrated
experimentally to be able to plan long-horizon, sequential trajectories with a
goal conditioned policy and generate plans that are robust.

privacy constraint requires that any individual database learns nothing about
the demands of all users. The users are connected to each database via an
error-free shared-link. In this paper, we aim to characterize the optimal
trade-off between users' memory and communication load for such systems. Based
on the proposed novel approach of \emph{cache-aided interference alignment

when $N=2$ and $3$ verified by the computer-aided approach. Second, when

depending on the nature of the potential energy surfaces. Upon excitation of a
chromophore in a complex, ionization of its weakly bound neighbour via energy
transfer happens via a unique relaxation process known as intermolecular
Coulombic decay (ICD); a phenomenon of renewed focus owing to its relevance in
biological systems. Herein, we report an experimental evidence of outer-valence
ICD induced by multiphoton excitation by near UV radiation of 4.4 eV photons,
hitherto unknown in molecular systems. In the binary complexes of
2,6-difluorophenylacetylene with aliphatic amines such as dimethylamine and
trimethylamine a resonant two-photon excitation is localized on the
2,6-difluorophenylacetylene chromophore. The absorbed energy is then
transferred to its hydrogen-bonded partner amine and resulting in the formation
of an amine cation. The kinetic energy distribution of the amine cations is
invariant with respect to the initial geometry of the binary complex. The
present experimental results combined with electronic structure calculations
provide valuable insights into the nature of ICD in van der Waals complexes and
more importantly, the role of ICD as a fast, efficient, and prominent decay
channel following excitation at modest (4.4 eV) photon energies.

developed method, WhoSGlAd, that takes the utmost advantage of the whole
oscillation spectrum of solar-like stars by simultaneously adjusting the
acoustic glitches and the smoothly varying trend. For each choice of input
physics, we computed models which account, at best, for a set of seismic
indicators that are representative of the stellar structure and are as
uncorrelated as possible. The search for optimal models was carried out through
a Levenberg-Marquardt minimisation. First, we found individual optimal models
for both stars. We then selected the best candidates to fit both stars while
imposing a common age and composition. Results: We computed realistic ranges of
stellar parameters for individual stars. We also provide two models of the
system regarded as a whole. We were not able to build binary models with the
whole set of choices of input physics considered for individual stars as our

the optimal model search or invoke non-standard physical processes.

from few examples, often by using already acquired knowledge. The new data
often differs from the previously seen data due to a domain shift, that is, a
change of the input-target distribution. While several methods perform well on
small domain shifts like new target classes with similar inputs, larger domain
shifts are still challenging. Large domain shifts may result in high-level
concepts that are not shared between the original and the new domain, whereas
low-level concepts like edges in images might still be shared and useful. For
cross-domain few-shot learning, we suggest representation fusion to unify
different abstraction levels of a deep neural network into one representation.
We propose Cross-domain Hebbian Ensemble Few-shot learning (CHEF), which
achieves representation fusion by an ensemble of Hebbian learners acting on
different layers of a deep neural network. Ablation studies show that
representation fusion is a decisive factor to boost cross-domain few-shot
learning. On the few-shot datasets miniImagenet and tieredImagenet with small
domain shifts, CHEF is competitive with state-of-the-art methods. On
cross-domain few-shot benchmark challenges with larger domain shifts, CHEF
establishes novel state-of-the-art results in all categories. We further apply
CHEF on a real-world cross-domain application in drug discovery. We consider a

twelve associated toxicity prediction tasks. On these tasks, that are highly
relevant for computational drug discovery, CHEF significantly outperforms all

significant role in long-term stability and serviceability. However, rock salt
undergoes non-linear creep deformation due to long-term loading caused by
subsurface storage. Salt caverns have complex geometries and the geological
domain surrounding salt caverns has a vast amount of material heterogeneity. To
safely store gases in caverns, a thorough analysis of the geological domain

caverns subjected to long-term loading. In this work, we present a rigorous and
systematic modeling study to quantify the impact of heterogeneity on the

for the non-linear creep deformation and also to model tertiary creep. The
computational scheme was benchmarked with the already existing experimental
study. The impact of cyclic loading on the cavern was studied considering
maximum and minimum pressure that depends on lithostatic pressure. The
influence of geometric heterogeneity such as irregularly-shaped caverns and

Bayesian filtering problem structurally similar to the ODE setting. The usage
of a process that is Markov in time and statistically homogeneous in space
leads to a probabilistic spectral simulation method that allows for an
efficient realization. Furthermore, the Bayesian perspective allows the
incorporation of methods developed within the context of information field

in a system. Limiting the number of Sybil (bad) IDs to a minority is critical
to the use of well-established tools for tolerating malicious behavior, such as
Byzantine agreement and secure multiparty computation.
  A popular technique for enforcing a Sybil minority is resource burning: the
verifiable consumption of a network resource, such as computational power,
bandwidth, or memory. Unfortunately, typical defenses based on resource burning
require non-Sybil (good) IDs to consume at least as many resources as the
adversary. Additionally, they have a high resource burning cost, even when the
system membership is relatively stable.
  Here, we present a new Sybil defense, ERGO, that guarantees (1) there is
always a minority of bad IDs; and (2) when the system is under significant
attack, the good IDs consume asymptotically less resources than the bad. In
particular, for churn rate that can vary exponentially, the resource burning
rate for good IDs under ERGO is O(\sqrt{TJ} + J), where T is the resource
burning rate of the adversary, and J is the join rate of good IDs. We show this
resource burning rate is asymptotically optimal for a large class of
algorithms.
  We empirically evaluate ERGO alongside prior Sybil defenses. Additionally, we
show that ERGO can be combined with machine learning techniques for classifying
Sybil IDs, while preserving its theoretical guarantees. Based on our
experiments comparing ERGO with two previous Sybil defenses, ERGO improves on
the amount of resource burning relative to the adversary by up to 2 orders of

selection is a very intriguing but still underexplored area. In this paper, we
show that question rewriting (QR) of the conversational context allows to shed
more light on this phenomenon and also use it to evaluate robustness of
different answer selection approaches. We introduce a simple framework that
enables an automated analysis of the conversational question answering (QA)
performance using question rewrites, and present the results of this analysis
on the TREC CAsT and QuAC (CANARD) datasets. Our experiments uncover
sensitivity to question formulation of the popular state-of-the-art models for
reading comprehension and passage ranking. Our results demonstrate that the
reading comprehension model is insensitive to question formulation, while the
passage ranking changes dramatically with a little variation in the input
question. The benefit of QR is that it allows us to pinpoint and group such
cases automatically. We show how to use this methodology to verify whether QA
models are really learning the task or just finding shortcuts in the dataset,
and better understand the frequent types of error they make.

  arXiv:2004.11822",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating 3D human poses from a monocular video is still a challenging task.
Many existing methods' performance drops when the target person is occluded by
other objects, or the motion is too fast/slow relative to the scale and speed
of the training data. Moreover, many of these methods are not designed or
trained under severe occlusion explicitly, making their performance on handling
occlusion compromised. Addressing these problems, we introduce a
spatio-temporal network for robust 3D human pose estimation. As humans in
videos may appear in different scales and have various motion speeds, we apply
multi-scale spatial features for 2D joints or keypoints prediction in each
individual frame, and multi-stride temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) to
estimate 3D joints or keypoints. Furthermore, we design a spatio-temporal
discriminator based on body structures as well as limb motions to assess
whether the predicted pose forms a valid pose and a valid movement. During
training, we explicitly mask out some keypoints to simulate various occlusion
cases, from minor to severe occlusion, so that our network can learn better and
becomes robust to various degrees of occlusion. As there are limited 3D
ground-truth data, we further utilize 2D video data to inject a semi-supervised
learning capability to our network. Moreover, we observe that there is a
discrepancy between 3D pose prediction and 2D pose estimation due to different
pose variations between video and image training datasets. We, therefore
propose a confidence-based inference stage optimization to adaptively enforce
3D pose projection to match 2D pose estimation to further improve final pose
prediction accuracy. Experiments on public datasets validate the effectiveness
of our method, and our ablation studies show the strengths of our network's
individual submodules.

security during online exams. To address such issues, researchers frequently
proposed different techniques and tools. However, a study summarizing and
analyzing latest developments, particularly in the area of online examination,
is hard to find in the literature. In this article, an SLR for online
examination is performed to select and analyze 53 studies published during the
last five years. Subsequently, five leading online exams features targeted in
the selected studies are identified and underlying development approaches for
the implementation of online exams solutions are explored. Furthermore, 16
important techniques and 11 datasets are presented. In addition, 21 online
exams tools proposed in the selected studies are identified. Additionally, 25
leading existing tools used in the selected studies are also presented.
Finally, the participation of countries in online exam research is
investigated. Key factors for the global adoption of online exams are
identified and investigated. This facilitates the selection of right online

infrastructure and overall cost. To conclude, the findings of this article
provide a solid platform for the researchers and practitioners of the domain to

the form of general space and time operators. The definition of these operators
is achieved by establishing a second quantum field in the momentum space of the
standard field we want to localize (here Klein-Gordon field). The motivation
for defining a new field in momentum space is as follows. In standard field
theories one can define a momentum (and energy) operator for a field excitation
but not a general position (and time) operator because the field satisfies a
differential equation in position space and, through its Fourier transform, an
algebraic equation in momentum space. Thus, in a field theory which does the
opposite, namely it satisfies a differential equation in momentum space and an
algebraic equation in position space, we will be able to define a position and
time operator. Since the new field lives in the momentum space of the
Klein-Gordon field, the creation/annihilation operators of the former, which
build the new space and time operators, reduce to the field operators of the
latter. As a result, particle states of Klein-Gordon field are eigenstates of
the new space and time operators and therefore localized on a space-time
described by their spectrum. Finally, we show that this space-time is flat
because it accommodates the two postulates of special relativity.
Interpretation of special relativistic notions as inertial observers and proper
acceleration in terms of the new field is also provided.

channels subject to correlated noise without joint decoding. The method can be
used with any combination of codes, code-rates and decoding techniques. In the
approach, a continuous realization of noise is estimated from a lead channel by
subtracting its decoded output from its received signal. This estimate is then
used to improve the accuracy of decoding of an orthogonal channel that is
experiencing correlated noise. In this design, channels aid each other only
through the provision of noise estimates post-decoding. In a Gauss-Markov model
of correlated noise, we constructive establish that noise recycling employing a
simple successive order enables higher rates than not recycling noise.
Simulations illustrate noise recycling can be employed with any code and
decoder, and that noise recycling shows Block Error Rate (BLER) benefits when
applying the same predetermined order as used to enhance the rate region.
Finally, for short codes we establish that an additional BLER improvement is
possible through noise recycling with racing, where the lead channel is not
pre-determined, but is chosen on the fly based on which decoder completes
first.

Milky Way (MW) and M31. For a positional analysis, we introduce an extension to
the `4-galaxy-normal density plot' method \citep[][P13]{Pawlowski13}. It finds
the normal directions to the predominant planar configurations of satellites of
a system, yielding for each a \textit{collection} of planes of increasing
member satellites. This allows to quantify the quality of planes in terms of
population ($N_{\rm sat}$) and spatial flattening ($c/a$). We apply this method
to the latest data for confirmed MW and M31 satellite samples, with 46 and 34
satellites, respectively. New MW satellites form part of planes previously
identified from the sample with $N_{\rm sat}=27$ studied in P13: we identify a
new plane with $N_{\rm sat}=39$ as thin as the VPOS-3 ($c/a\sim 0.2$), and with
roughly the same normal direction; so far the most populated plane that thin
reported in the Local Group. We introduce a new method to determine, using
kinematic data, the axis of maximum co-orbitation of MW satellites.
Interestingly, this axis approximately coincides with the normal to the former
plane: $\geq45\pm5\%$ of satellites co-orbit. In M31 we discover a plane with
$N_{\rm sat}=18$ and $c/a\sim0.15$, i.e., quality comparable to the GPoA, and
perpendicular to it. This structure is viewed face-on from the Sun making it
susceptible to M31 satellite distance uncertainties. An estimation of the
perpendicular velocity dispersion suggests it is dynamically unstable. Finally
we find that mass is not a property determining a satellite's membership to
good quality planes.

we call as Multi-Armed Bandits with dependent arms. More specifically, multiple
arms are grouped together to form a cluster, and the reward distributions of
arms belonging to the same cluster are known functions of an unknown parameter
that is a characteristic of the cluster. Thus, pulling an arm $i$ not only
reveals information about its own reward distribution, but also about all those
arms that share the same cluster with arm $i$. This ""correlation"" amongst the
arms complicates the exploration-exploitation trade-off that is encountered in
the MABP because the observation dependencies allow us to test simultaneously
multiple hypotheses regarding the optimality of an arm. We develop learning
algorithms based on the UCB principle which utilize these additional side
observations appropriately while performing exploration-exploitation trade-off.
We show that the regret of our algorithms grows as $O(K\log T)$, where $K$ is
the number of clusters. In contrast, for an algorithm such as the vanilla UCB
that is optimal for the classical MABP and does not utilize these dependencies,
the regret scales as $O(M\log T)$ where $M$ is the number of arms.

data distributions. The transfer generalization gap is the difference between
the population loss on the target data distribution and the training loss. The
training data set generally includes data drawn from both source and target
distributions. This work presents novel information-theoretic upper bounds on
the average transfer generalization gap that capture $(i)$ the domain shift
between the target data distribution $P'_Z$ and the source distribution $P_Z$
through a two-parameter family of generalized
$(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$-Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergences; and $(ii)$ the
sensitivity of the transfer learner output $W$ to each individual sample of the
data set $Z_i$ via the mutual information $I(W;Z_i)$. For $\alpha_1 \in (0,1)$,
the $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$-JS divergence can be bounded even when the support of
$P_Z$ is not included in that of $P'_Z$. This contrasts the Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence $D_{KL}(P_Z||P'_Z)$-based bounds of Wu et al. [1], which are
vacuous under this assumption. Moreover, the obtained bounds hold for unbounded
loss functions with bounded cumulant generating functions, unlike the
$\phi$-divergence based bound of Wu et al. [1]. We also obtain new upper bounds
on the average transfer excess risk in terms of the $(\alpha_1,\alpha_2)$-JS
divergence for empirical weighted risk minimization (EWRM), which minimizes the
weighted average training losses over source and target data sets. Finally, we
provide a numerical example to illustrate the merits of the introduced bounds.

the level of single neurons in biological neural networks. The properties of
chaotic neurons inspires us to employ them in artificial learning systems.
Here, we propose a Neurochaos Learning (NL) architecture, where the neurons
used to extract features from data are 1D chaotic maps. ChaosFEX+SVM, an
instance of this NL architecture, is proposed as a hybrid combination of chaos
and classical machine learning algorithm. We formally prove that a single layer
of NL with a finite number of 1D chaotic neurons satisfies the Universal
Approximation Theorem with an exact value for the number of chaotic neurons
needed to approximate a discrete real valued function with finite support. This
is made possible due to the topological transitivity property of chaos and the
existence of uncountably infinite number of dense orbits for the chosen 1D
chaotic map. The chaotic neurons in NL get activated under the presence of an
input stimulus (data) and output a chaotic firing trajectory. From such chaotic
firing trajectories of individual neurons of NL, we extract Firing Time, Firing
Rate, Energy and Entropy that constitute ChaosFEX features. These ChaosFEX
features are then fed to a Support Vector Machine with linear kernel for
classification. The effectiveness of chaotic feature engineering performed by
NL (ChaosFEX+SVM) is demonstrated for synthetic and real world datasets in the
low and high training sample regimes. Specifically, we consider the problem of
classification of genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from other coronaviruses
(SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and others). With just one training sample per class for
1000 random trials of training, we report an average macro F1-score > 0.99 for
the classification of SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 genome sequences. Robustness
of ChaosFEX features to additive noise is also demonstrated.

of image-to-image translation problems, it is well-known that images generated
by usual CNNs are distorted by checkerboard artifacts which mainly caused in
forward-propagation of upsampling layers. However, checkerboard artifacts in
image enhancement have never been discussed. In this paper, we point out that
applying U-Net based CNNs to image enhancement causes checkerboard artifacts.
In contrast, the proposed network that contains fixed convolutional layers can
perfectly prevent the artifacts. In addition, the proposed network
architecture, which can handle both local and global features, enables us to
improve the performance of image enhancement. Experimental results show that
the use of fixed convolutional layers can prevent checkerboard artifacts and

implement and extraordinarily successful for predicting material failure times.
However, it neglects memory effects and time-ordering dependence, and therefore
runs into difficulties dealing with highly intermittent or transient stochastic
loads with heavy tailed distributions. Such loads appear frequently in a wide
range of applications in ocean and mechanical engineering, such as wind
turbines and offshore structures. In this work we employ the Serebrinsky-Ortiz
cohesive envelope model for material fatigue to characterize the effects of
load intermittency on the fatigue-crack nucleation time. We first formulate
efficient numerical integration schemes, which allow for the direct
characterization of the fatigue life in terms of any given load time-series.
Subsequently, we consider the case of stochastic intermittent loads with given
statistical characteristics. To overcome the need for expensive Monte-Carlo
simulations, we formulate the fatigue life as an up-crossing problem of the
coherent envelope. Assuming statistical independence for the large intermittent
spikes and using probabilistic arguments we derive closed expressions for the
up-crossing properties of the coherent envelope and obtain analytical
approximations for the probability mass function of the failure time. The
analytical expressions are derived directly in terms of the probability density
function of the load, as well as the coherent envelope. We examine the accuracy
of the analytical approximations and compare the predicted failure time with
the standard rainflow algorithm for various loads. Finally, we use the
analytical expressions to examine the robustness of the derived probability
distribution for the failure time with respect to the coherent envelope
geometrical properties.
