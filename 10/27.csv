if, and when, a support ticket becomes a candidate for escalation. This paper
explores the use of sentiment analysis tools on customer-support analyst

escalated. The results of this research indicate a considerable difference in
the sentiment between escalated support tickets and non-escalated support

Approximate numerical methods and data features like censoring and

expansion allows for a consistent treatment of ultraviolet tails via
renormalization group techniques. At leading order, it leads to the resummation
of rainbow diagrams for the quark propagator, with, however, a trivial running
of both the gluon mass and the quark-gluon coupling. In a previous work, by
using a simple model for a more realistic running of these parameters, we could
reproduce the known phenomenology of chiral symmetry breaking, including a
satisfactory description of the lattice data for the quark mass function. Here,
we get rid of this model-dependence by taking our approximation scheme to
next-to-leading order. This allows us to consistently include the realistic
running of the parameters and to access the unquenched gluon and ghost
propagators to first nontrivial order, which we can compare to available
lattice data for an even more stringent test of our approach. In particular,

solving the track-assignment detailed routing problem for advanced node analog
circuits. Our approach adopts an attention-based reinforcement learning (RL)

supervision as a way to leverage solutions generated by a conventional genetic
algorithm (GA). For this, our approach minimizes the Kullback-Leibler
divergence loss between the output from the RL policy model and a solution
distribution obtained from the genetic solver. The key advantage of this
approach is that the router can learn a policy in an offline setting with
supervision, while improving the run-time performance nearly 100x over the
genetic solver. Moreover, the quality of the solutions our approach produces
matches well with those generated by GA. We show that especially for complex
problems, our supervised RL method provides good quality solution similar to
conventional attention-based RL without comprising run time performance. The
ability to learn from example designs and train the router to get similar
solutions with orders of magnitude run-time improvement can impact the design
flow dramatically, potentially enabling increased design exploration and

The biomarker distribution is decomposed into a probability of positive value
and the expected value among positive values. Shared random effects can
represent the association structure between the biomarker and the terminal
event. The computational burden increases compared to standard joint models
with a single regression model for the biomarker. In this context, the
frequentist estimation implemented in the R package frailtypack can be
challenging for complex models (i.e., large number of parameters and dimension
of the random effects). As an alternative, we propose a Bayesian estimation of
two-part joint models based on the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation
(INLA) algorithm to alleviate the computational burden and fit more complex
models. Our simulation studies confirm that INLA provides accurate
approximation of posterior estimates and to reduced computation time and
variability of estimates compared to frailtypack in the situations considered.
We contrast the Bayesian and frequentist approaches in the analysis of two
randomized cancer clinical trials (GERCOR and PRIME studies), where INLA has a
reduced variability for the association between the biomarker and the risk of
event. Moreover, the Bayesian approach was able to characterize subgroups of
patients associated with different responses to treatment in the PRIME study.
Our study suggests that the Bayesian approach using INLA algorithm enables to
fit complex joint models that might be of interest in a wide range of clinical
applications.

make use of time in their execution. We provide a process algebra syntax that
makes time information available to processes, and a transition semantics that
takes account of fundamental properties of time. Additional properties can be
added by the user if desirable. This timed protocol framework can be
implemented either as a simulation tool or as a symbolic analysis tool in which
time references are represented by logical variables, and in which the
properties of time are implemented as constraints on those time logical
variables. These constraints are carried along the symbolic execution of the
protocol. The satisfiability of these constraints can be evaluated as the
analysis proceeds, so attacks that violate the laws of physics can be rejected
as impossible. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by using the
Maude-NPA protocol analyzer together with an SMT solver that is used to
evaluate the satisfiability of timing constraints. We provide a sound and
complete protocol transformation from our timed process algebra to the
Maude-NPA syntax and semantics, and we prove its soundness and completeness. We
then use the tool to analyze Mafia fraud and distance hijacking attacks on a

interacting particles remains small, as they do not respect exact elastic
unitarity. This limits their predictive power towards new physics at a higher
scale if small separations from the Standard Model are found at the LHC or
elsewhere. Unitarized chiral perturbation theory techniques have been devised
to extend the reach of the EFT to regimes where partial waves are saturating

Here we take one of the best known of them, the Inverse Amplitude Method (IAM),
and carefully following its derivation, we quantify the uncertainty introduced
at each step. We compare its hadron ChPT and its electroweak sector Higgs EFT
applications. We find that the relative theoretical uncertainty of the IAM at
the mass of the first resonance encountered in a partial-wave is of the same
order in the counting as the starting uncertainty of the EFT at near-threshold
energies, so that its unitarized extension should \textit{a priori} be expected
to be reasonably successful. This is so provided a check for zeroes of the
partial wave amplitude is carried out and, if they appear near the resonance

when the number of actively participating users is variable, i.e., they are
adaptive. However, they are not safe under network partitions, i.e., they do
not guarantee finality. On the other hand, classical blockchain protocols, like
PBFT, achieve finality but not adaptivity. Indeed, the CAP theorem in the
context of blockchains asserts that no protocol can simultaneously offer both
adaptivity and finality.
  We propose a new blockchain protocol, called the checkpointed longest chain,
that offers individual users the choice between finality and adaptivity instead
of imposing it at a system-wide level. This protocol's salient feature is that
it supports two distinct confirmation rules: one that guarantees adaptivity and
the other finality. The more optimistic adaptive rule always confirms blocks
that are marked as finalized by the more conservative rule, and may possibly
confirm more blocks during variable participation levels. Clients (users) make
a local choice between the confirmation rules as per their personal preference,
while miners follow a fixed block proposal rule that is consistent with both
confirmation rules. The proposed protocol has the additional benefit of
intrinsic validity: the finalized blocks always lie on a single blockchain, and
therefore miners can attest to the validity of transactions while proposing
blocks. Our protocol builds on the notion of a finality gadget, a popular
technique for adding finality to longest-chain protocols.

two phase flows with surface tension. The Level-Set (LS) method with piece-wise
quadratic (P2) interpolation for the liquid-gas interface is used in order to
reach higher-order convergence rates in regions with smooth interface. A
balanced-force implementation of the continuum surface force model is used to
take into account the surface tension and to solve static problems as
accurately as possible. Given that this requires a balance between the
discretization used for the LS function, and that used for the pressure field,
an equal-order P2/P2/P2 scheme is proposed for the Navier-Stokes and LS
advection equations, which are strongly coupled with each other. This fully
implicit formulation is stabilized using the residual-based variational
multiscale framework. In order to improve the accuracy and obtain optimal
convergence rates with a minimum number of elements, an anisotropic mesh
adaption method is proposed where the unstructured mesh is kept as fine as
possible close to the zero iso-value of the P2 LS function. Elements are
automatically stretched in regions with flat interface in order to keep the
complexity fixed during the simulation. The accuracy and efficiency of this
approach are demonstrated for two and three dimensional simulations of a rising
bubble.

the magneto-rotational instability. The molecular abundances averaged over the
TMC1A disk are similar to its protostellar envelope and other, older Class II
disks. We meanwhile find a discrepancy between the young disk's molecular
abundances relative to Solar System objects. Abundance comparisons between the

particular structural properties of a RGG. We establish for it a fluid limit
describing the time-evolution of number of Rydberg atoms, and show numerically
that the expression remains accurate across a wider range of particle densities
than an earlier approach based on an RSA process on an Erdos-Renyi Random Graph
(ERRG). Finally, we also come up with a new heuristic using random graphs that
gives a recursion to describe a normalized pair-correlation function of a
Rydberg gas. Our results suggest that even without dissipation, on long time
scales the statistics are affected most by the geometrical restrictions induced
by blockade effects, while on short time scales the statistics are affected
most by quantum mechanical effects.

proton disorder. Such calculations are only made tractable because we combine
machine-learning methods and advanced free-energy techniques. The computed
phase diagram is in qualitative agreement with experiment, particularly at

comparable with the subtle uncertainties introduced by proton disorder and the

the extraction of relevant features in EEG signals results crucial for

composite curved structures, which relies on Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) and
equilibrium. Using a single element through the thickness in combination with a
calibrated layerwise integration rule or a homogenized approach, the 3D solid
isogeometric modeling grants an inexpensive and accurate approximation in terms
of displacements (and their derivatives) and in-plane stresses, while
through-the-thickness stress components are poorly approximated. Applying a
further post-processing step, an accurate out-of-plane stress state is also
recovered, even from a coarse displacement solution. This is based on a direct
integration of the equilibrium equations in strong form, involving high order
derivatives of the displacement field. Such a continuity requirement is fully
granted by IGA shape function properties. The post-processing step is locally
applied, which grants that no additional coupled terms appear in the
equilibrium, allowing for a direct reconstruction without the need to further
iterate to resolve the out-of-balance momentum equation. Several numerical
results show the good performance of this approach particularly for composite
stacks with significant radius-to-thickness ratio and number of plies. In
particular, in the latter case, where a layerwise technique employing a number
of degrees of freedom directly proportional to the number of plies would be
much more computationally demanding, the proposed method can be regarded as a
very appealing alternative choice.

representation learning (HGRL), which aims to embed rich structural and
semantic information in heterogeneous information networks (HINs) into
low-dimensional node representations. To date, most HGRL models rely on
hand-crafted meta-paths. However, the dependency on manually-defined meta-paths
requires domain knowledge, which is difficult to obtain for complex HINs. More
importantly, the pre-defined or generated meta-paths of all existing HGRL
methods attached to each node type or node pair cannot be personalised to each
individual node. To fully unleash the power of HGRL, we present a novel
framework, Personalised Meta-path based Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks
(PM-HGNN), to jointly generate meta-paths that are personalised for each
individual node in a HIN and learn node representations for the target
downstream task like node classification. Precisely, PM-HGNN treats the
meta-path generation as a Markov Decision Process and utilises a policy network
to adaptively generate a meta-path for each individual node and simultaneously
learn effective node representations. The policy network is trained with deep
reinforcement learning by exploiting the performance improvement on a
downstream task. We further propose an extension, PM-HGNN++, to better encode
relational structure and accelerate the training during the meta-path
generation. Experimental results reveal that both PM-HGNN and PM-HGNN++ can
significantly and consistently outperform 16 competing baselines and

Qualitative analysis also shows that PM-HGNN++ can identify meaningful

This distortion field is measurable at the locations of stars with accurate
positions provided by the Gaia DR2 catalog; we develop the use of Gaussian
process regression (GPR) to interpolate the distortion field to arbitrary
locations in each exposure. We introduce an extension to standard GPR
techniques that exploits the knowledge that the 2-dimensional distortion field
is curl-free. Applied to several hundred 90-second exposures from the Dark
Energy Survey as a testbed, we find that the GPR correction reduces the
variance of the turbulent distortions $\approx12\times$, on average, with
better performance in denser regions of the Gaia catalog. The RMS
per-coordinate distortion in the $riz$ bands is typically $\approx7$ mas before
any correction, and $\approx2$ mas after application of the GPR model. The GPR
astrometric corrections are validated by the observation that their use
reduces, from 10 to 5 mas RMS, the residuals to an orbit fit to $riz$-band
observations over 5 years of the $r=18.5$ trans-Neptunian object Eris. We also

therefore, the overall result did not verify General Relativity. This claim,
and the resulting accusation of Eddington's bias, was repeated with
exaggeration in later literature, and has become ubiquitous. The 1919 and 1980
analyses of the same data provide two discordant conclusions. We reanalyse the
1919 data, and identify the error that undermines the conclusions of Earman and
Glymour.

Such expressions have a similar structure to the small-correlation expansion
derived by Sessak and Monasson, of which they provide an improvement in the
case of non-zero magnetization at low temperatures, as well as in presence of
random external fields. The present work provides an extensive comparison with
most common inference methods used to reconstruct the model parameters in
several regimes, i.e. by varying both the network topology and the distribution
of fields and couplings. The comparison shows that no method is uniformly
better than every other one, but DC appears nevertheless as one of the most
accurate and reliable approaches to infer couplings and fields from first and
second moments in a significant range of parameters.

solid phase as a bosonic commensurate crystal consisting of helium dimers with
topologically protected zero-point vacancies which are delocalized at low

learning tool to train a deep neural network (DNN) classifier and then deploys
the classifier as an end-user software product or a cloud service. In an
information embedding attack, an attacker is the provider of a malicious
third-party machine learning tool. The attacker embeds a message into the DNN
classifier during training and recovers the message via querying the API of the
black-box classifier after the user deploys it. Information embedding attacks
have attracted growing attention because of various applications such as
watermarking DNN classifiers and compromising user privacy. State-of-the-art
information embedding attacks have two key limitations: 1) they cannot verify
the correctness of the recovered message, and 2) they are not robust against
post-processing of the classifier.
  In this work, we aim to design information embedding attacks that are
verifiable and robust against popular post-processing methods. Specifically, we
leverage Cyclic Redundancy Check to verify the correctness of the recovered
message. Moreover, to be robust against post-processing, we leverage Turbo
codes, a type of error-correcting codes, to encode the message before embedding
it to the DNN classifier. We propose to recover the message via adaptively
querying the classifier to save queries. Our adaptive recovery strategy
leverages the property of Turbo codes that supports error correcting with a
partial code. We evaluate our information embedding attacks using simulated
messages and apply them to three applications, where messages have semantic
interpretations. We consider 8 popular methods to post-process the classifier.
Our results show that our attacks can accurately and verifiably recover the
messages in all considered scenarios, while state-of-the-art attacks cannot
accurately recover the messages in many scenarios.

the discriminator and the generator, predicting object coordinates should be
replaced by predicting contextual regions for objects, and overall the
adversarial loss helps the performance and removes the need for any custom

select target stars to maximize the number of Earth-like exoplanets that can
have their atmospheric compositions characterized. Because one of these
missions' aims is to detect biosignatures, they should also consider the
expected biosignature yield of planets around these stars.
  In this work, we develop a method of computing relative biosignature yields
among potential target stars, given a model of habitability and biosignature
genesis, and using a star's habitability history. As an illustration and first
application of this method, we use MESA stellar models to calculate the time
evolution of the habitable zone, and examine three simple models for
biosignature genesis to calculate the relative biosignature yield for different
stars.
  We find that the relative merits of K stars versus F stars depend sensitively
on model choice. In particular, use of the present-day habitable zone as a
proxy for biosignature detectability favors young, luminous stars lacking the
potential for long-term habitability. Biosignature yields are also sensitive to
whether life can arise on Cold Start exoplanets that enter the habitable zone
after formation, an open question deserving of more attention.
  Using the case study of biosignature yields calculated for $\theta$ Cygni and
55 Cancri, we find that robust mission design and target selection for HabEx
and LUVOIR depends on: choosing a specific model of biosignature appearance
with time; the terrestrial planet occurrence rate as a function of orbital
separation; precise knowledge of stellar properties; and accurate stellar

particles in dense systems of active Brownian particles (ABPs) in two spatial
dimensions. The ABP undergo translational and rotational Brownian dynamics, and
are equipped with a fixed self-propulsion speed along their orientational
vector that describes their active motility. The resulting equations of motion
for the tagged-particle density correlation functions describe the various
cases of tracer dynamics close to the glass transition: that of a passive
colloidal particle in a suspension of ABP, that of a single active particle in
a glass-forming passive host suspensions, and that of active tracers in a bath
of active particles. Numerical results are presented for these cases assuming
hard-sphere interactions among the particles. The qualitative and quantitative
accuracy of the theory is tested against event-driven Brownian dynamics (ED-BD)
simulations of active and passive hard disks. Simulation and theory are found
in quantitative agreement, provided one adjusts the overall density (as known
from the passive description of glassy dynamics), and allows for a rescaling of
self-propulsion velocities in the active host system. These adjustments account
for the fact that ABP-MCT generally overestimates the tendency for kinetic

  between Accuracy and Interpretability","12 pages; minor edits",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To date, there has been no formal study of the statistical cost of
interpretability in machine learning. As such, the discourse around potential
trade-offs is often informal and misconceptions abound. In this work, we aim to
initiate a formal study of these trade-offs. A seemingly insurmountable
roadblock is the lack of any agreed upon definition of interpretability.
Instead, we propose a shift in perspective. Rather than attempt to define
interpretability, we propose to model the \emph{act} of \emph{enforcing}
interpretability. As a starting point, we focus on the setting of empirical
risk minimization for binary classification, and view interpretability as a
constraint placed on learning. That is, we assume we are given a subset of
hypothesis that are deemed to be interpretable, possibly depending on the data
distribution and other aspects of the context. We then model the act of
enforcing interpretability as that of performing empirical risk minimization
over the set of interpretable hypotheses. This model allows us to reason about
the statistical implications of enforcing interpretability, using known results
in statistical learning theory. Focusing on accuracy, we perform a case
analysis, explaining why one may or may not observe a trade-off between
accuracy and interpretability when the restriction to interpretable classifiers
does or does not come at the cost of some excess statistical risk. We close
with some worked examples and some open problems, which we hope will spur
further theoretical development around the tradeoffs involved in
interpretability.

vortex with a rigid circular boundary, where a massless vortex can only precess
uniformly. In contrast, the presence of a sufficiently large filled vortex core
renders such precession unstable. A small core mass can also lead to small
radial oscillations, which are, in turn, clear evidence of the associated

presence of such radial oscillations, implying that this more realistic GP

people believed, which is also a new aspect for analyzing DNNs. However,

first selects the most effective candidate positions to modify by considering

drops some less important points in the reduce stage. Experiments demonstrate

wavelength-calibration of spectrographs. It is designed with the needs of
extreme-precision radial velocity (EPRV) in mind, which require that
instruments be calibrated or stabilized to better than $10^{-4}$ pixels.
Instruments vary along only a few dominant degrees of freedom, especially EPRV
instruments that feature highly stabilized optical systems and detectors.
Excalibur takes advantage of this property by using all calibration data to
construct a low-dimensional representation of all accessible calibration states
for an instrument. Excalibur also takes advantage of laser frequency combs or
etalons, which generate a dense set of stable calibration points. This density
permits the use of a non-parametric wavelength solution that can adapt to any
instrument or detector oddities better than parametric models, such as a
polynomial. We demonstrate the success of this method with data from the
EXtreme PREcision Spectrograph (EXPRES), which uses a laser frequency comb.
When wavelengths are assigned to laser comb lines using excalibur, the RMS of
the residuals is about five times lower than wavelengths assigned using
polynomial fits to individual exposures. Radial-velocity measurements of HD
34411 showed a reduction in RMS scatter over a 10-month time baseline from

astrophysics and cosmology, where the unknown distribution of objects in our
Universe is often the science goal. In this work, we incorporate BNNs with
flexible posterior parameterizations into a hierarchical inference framework
that allows for the reconstruction of population hyperparameters and removes
the bias introduced by the training distribution. We focus on the challenge of
producing posterior PDFs for strong gravitational lens mass model parameters
given Hubble Space Telescope (HST) quality single-filter, lens-subtracted,
synthetic imaging data. We show that the posterior PDFs are sufficiently
accurate (i.e., statistically consistent with the truth) across a wide variety
of power-law elliptical lens mass distributions. We then apply our approach to
test data sets whose lens parameters are drawn from distributions that are
drastically different from the training set. We show that our hierarchical
inference framework mitigates the bias introduced by an unrepresentative
training set's interim prior. Simultaneously, given a sufficiently broad
training set, we can precisely reconstruct the population hyperparameters
governing our test distributions. Our full pipeline, from training to
hierarchical inference on thousands of lenses, can be run in a day. The
framework presented here will allow us to efficiently exploit the full

gas onto giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and limit the efficiency at which gas is
converted into stars within these GMCs. While feedback from supernova
explosions has been the popular feedback mechanism included in simulations of
galaxy formation and evolution, `early' feedback mechanisms such as stellar
winds, photoionisation and radiation pressure are expected to play an important
role in dispersing the gas after the onset of star formation. These feedback
processes typically take place on small scales ($\sim 10-100$ pc) and their
effects have therefore been difficult to constrain in environments other than
the Milky Way. We apply a novel statistical method to $\sim 1$"" resolution maps
of CO and Ha emission across a sample of nine nearby disc galaxies, in order to
measure the time over which GMCs are dispersed by feedback from young,
high-mass stars, as a function of the galactic environment. We find that GMCs
are typically dispersed within $\sim$ 3 Myr after the emergence of unembedded
high-mass stars, showing no significant trend with galactocentric radius.
Comparison with analytical predictions demonstrates that, independently of the
environment, early feedback mechanisms (particularly photoionisation and
stellar winds) play a crucial role in dispersing GMCs and limiting their star
formation efficiency in nearby galaxies. Finally, we show that the efficiency
at which the energy injected by these early feedback mechanisms couples with
the parent GMC is relatively low (a few tens of per cent), such that the vast
majority of momentum and energy emitted by the young stellar populations
escapes the parent GMC.

compile a sample of $\sim 500$ stars with radial velocities in the distant

large fraction of the sky and thus give a global view of the stellar halo. We
find that stars in the Southern hemisphere are on average blueshifted, while
stars in the North are redshifted, consistent with the expected, mostly
downwards acceleration of the inner halo due to the LMC. We compare these

evaluating the gravitational field at the positions of all resolution elements
can incur significant cost. Typical algorithms update the gravitational field
at the position of each resolution element every time the element is updated
hydrodynamically, but the actual required update frequencies for hydrodynamics
and gravity can be different in general. We show that the gravity calculation
in hydrodynamics simulations can be optimised by only updating gravity on a
timescale dictated by the already-determined maximum timestep for accurate
gravity integration $\Delta t_{\rm grav}$, while staying well within the
typical error budget of hydro schemes and gravity solvers. Our implementation
in the GIZMO code uses the tidal timescale introduced in Grudi\'c & Hopkins
2020 to determine $\Delta t_{\rm grav}$ and the force update frequency in turn,
and uses the jerk evaluated by the gravity solver to construct a predictor of
the acceleration for use between updates. We test the scheme on standard
self-gravitating hydrodynamics test problems, finding solutions very close to
the na\""{i}ve scheme while evaluating far fewer gravity forces, optimising the
simulations. We also demonstrate a $\sim 70\%$ speedup in a STARFORGE MHD GMC
simulation, with larger gains likely in higher-resolution runs. In general,
this scheme introduces a new tunable parameter for obtaining an optimal
compromise between accuracy and computational cost, in conjunction with e.g.
time-step tolerance, numerical resolution, and gravity solver tolerance.

of the background wind properties is a fundamental step towards the development
of any space weather prediction toolbox. In this pilot study, we focus on the
implementation and comparison of various models that are critical for a steady
state, solar wind forecasting framework. Specifically, we perform case studies
on Carrington rotations 2053, 2082 and 2104, and compare the performance of
magnetic field extrapolation models in conjunction with velocity empirical
formulations to predict solar wind properties at Lagrangian point L1. Two
different models to extrapolate the solar wind from the coronal domain to the
inner-heliospheric domain are presented, namely, (a) Kinematics based
(Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation [HUX]) model and (b) Physics based model.
The physics based model solves a set of conservative equations of hydrodynamics
using the PLUTO code and can additionally predict the thermal properties of
solar wind. The assessment in predicting solar wind parameters of the different
models is quantified through statistical measures. We further extend this
developed framework to also assess the polarity of inter-planetary magnetic
field at L1. Our best models for the case of CR2053 gives a very high
correlation coefficient ($\sim$ 0.73-0.81) and has an root mean square error of
($\sim$ 75-90 kms$^{-1}$). Additionally, the physics based model has a standard
deviation comparable with that obtained from the hourly OMNI solar wind data
and also produces a considerable match with observed solar wind proton
temperatures measured at L1 from the same database.

of projection effects, we consider two calibrations of the observational
scatter on richness estimates: a simple Gaussian model which account only for
the background contamination (BKG), and a model which further includes
contamination and incompleteness due to projection effects (PRJ). Assuming
either a $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum m_\nu$ or $w$CDM+$\sum m_\nu$ cosmology, and for
both scatter models, we derive cosmological constraints consistent with
multiple cosmological probes of the low and high redshift Universe, and in
particular with the SPT cluster abundance data. This result demonstrates that
the DES Y1 and SPT cluster counts provide consistent cosmological constraints,
if the same mass calibration data set is adopted. It thus supports the
conclusion of the DES Y1 cluster cosmology analysis which interprets the
tension observed with other cosmological probes in terms of systematics
affecting the stacked weak lensing analysis of optically--selected
low--richness clusters. Finally, we analyse the first combined optically-SZ
selected cluster catalogue obtained by including the SPT sample above the
maximum redshift probed by the DES Y1 redMaPPer sample. Besides providing a
mild improvement of the cosmological constraints, this data combination serves
as a stricter test of our scatter models: the PRJ model, providing scaling
relations consistent between the two abundance and multi-wavelength follow-up

where the BCS superconducting leads are coupled via the edges of a quantum Hall
sample. In this scenario, an out of equilibrium Josephson current develops,
which is numerically studied within the Floquet-Keldysh Green's function
formalism. We particularly focus on the time-averaged current as a function of
both the bias voltage and the magnetic flux threading the sample and analyze
the resonant multiple Andreev reflection processes that lead to an enhancement
of the quasiparticle transmission. We find that a full tomography of the dc
current in the voltage-flux plane allows for a complete spectroscopy of the
one-way edge modes and could be used as a hallmark of chiral edge mediated
transport in these hybrid devices.

lie significantly below the star-forming main sequence, indicating suppressed
star formation. While these radio structures tend to be physically small
compared to the host galaxy, the global star formation rate of the host is
affected. We evaluate the energetics of the radio structures interpreted first
as immature radio jets, and then as consequences of an AGN-driven radiative
outflow, and compare them to two criteria for successful feedback: the ability
to remove the CO-derived molecular gas mass from the galaxy gravitational
potential and the kinetic energy transfer to molecular clouds leading to
$v_\mathrm{cloud} > \sigma_*$. In most cases, the jet interpretation is
insufficient to provide the energy necessary to cause the star formation
suppression. Conversely, the wind interpretation provides ample energy in all
but one case. We conclude that it is more likely that the observed suppression
of star formation in the global host galaxy is due to ISM interactions of a
radiative outflow, rather than a small-scale radio jet.

quantification of magic. Previous studies of magic mostly focused on small
systems and largely relied on the discrete Wigner formalism (which is only well
behaved in odd prime power dimensions). Here we present an initiatory study of
the magic of genuinely many-body quantum states that may be strongly entangled,
with focus on the important case of many qubits, at a quantitative level. We
first address the basic question of how ""magical"" a many-body state can be, and
show that the maximum magic of an $n$-qubit state is essentially $n$,
simultaneously for a range of ""good"" magic measures. We then show that, in
fact, almost all $n$-qubit pure states have magic of nearly $n$. In the quest
for explicit, scalable cases of highly entangled states whose magic can be
understood, we connect the magic of hypergraph states with the second-order
nonlinearity of their underlying Boolean functions. Next, we go on and
investigate many-body magic in practical and physical contexts. We first
consider a variant of MBQC where the client is restricted to Pauli
measurements, in which magic is a necessary feature of the initial ""resource""
state. We show that $n$-qubit states with nearly $n$ magic, or indeed almost
all states, cannot supply nontrivial speedups over classical computers. We then
present an example of analyzing the magic of ""natural"" condensed matter systems

head-and-neck tumor model with an average maximum displacement of 30 mm, the
maximum surface offsets between benchmarks and predictions using the proposed
approach for 98% of the test cases are under 1.0 mm, which is the typical
resolution of high-quality interventional ultrasound. Each of the prediction
processes takes less than 0.5 s. With the resulting prediction accuracy and
computational efficiency, the proposed approach demonstrates its potential to
be clinically relevant.

possible breaks in the injection spectrum of SNRs. The effect of the energy

least one of three ways: models were trained on oracle text input and neglected
ASR errors, models were trained to predict only intents without the slot

address these issues. Our framework is built upon pretrained end-to-end (E2E)
ASR and self-supervised language models, such as BERT, and fine-tuned on a

the ASR component: supervised pretraining on transcribed speech, and
unsupervised pretraining by replacing the ASR encoder with self-supervised
speech representations, such as wav2vec. In parallel, we identify two essential
criteria for evaluating SLU models: environmental noise-robustness and E2E
semantics evaluation. Experiments on ATIS show that our SLU framework with
speech as input can perform on par with those using oracle text as input in
semantics understanding, even though environmental noise is present and a
limited amount of labeled semantics data is available for training.

repeatability, limiting their practical circuit applications. Here we propose a
strategy of using a 1L-WS$_2$ as an optimum tunnel barrier sandwiched in a
broken gap tunnel junction of highly doped black phosphorus (BP) and SnSe$_2$.
We achieve high yield tunnel diodes exhibiting highly repeatable, ultra-clean,

stability of the vdW tunnel diode circuit can be tuned from astability to
bistability by altering the constraint through choosing a voltage or a current
bias, respectively. In the astable mode under voltage bias, we demonstrate a
compact, voltage controlled oscillator without the need for an external tank

major research efforts at universities and laboratories across the world.
Indeed, many of the past participants in AI-HRI have been or are now involved
with research into trust in HRI. While trust has no consensus definition, it is
regularly associated with predictability, reliability, inciting confidence, and
meeting expectations. Furthermore, it is generally believed that trust is
crucial for adoption of both AI and robotics, particularly when transitioning
technologies from the lab to industrial, social, and consumer applications.
However, how does trust apply to the specific situations we encounter in the
AI-HRI sphere? Is the notion of trust in AI the same as that in HRI? We see a
growing need for research that lives directly at the intersection of AI and HRI
that is serviced by this symposium. Over the course of the two-day meeting, we

long-range connections at a time. This fundamentally abstracts networks such as
hybrid data centers, and class-based software-defined networks.
  Our technical contribution is a \emph{density-aware} approach that allows us
to simulate a set of \emph{oracles} for an overlay skeleton graph over a Hybrid

  As applications of our oracle simulations, with additional machinery that we
provide, we derive fast algorithms for fundamental distance-related tasks. One
of our core contributions is an algorithm in the Hybrid model for computing
\emph{exact} weighted shortest paths from $\tilde O(n^{1/3})$ sources which
completes in $\tilde O(n^{1/3})$ rounds w.h.p. This improves, in both the
runtime and the number of sources, upon the algorithm of [Kuhn and Schneider,

incentivizing the agents to change their behaviors. To be effective, the
designer must anticipate how the agents react to the intervention, which is
dictated by their often unknown payoff functions. Therefore, learning about the
agents is a prerequisite for intervention. In this paper, we provide a unified
framework for learning and intervention in games. We cast the equilibria of
games as individual layers and integrate them into an end-to-end optimization
framework. To enable the backward propagation through the equilibria of games,
we propose two approaches, respectively based on explicit and implicit
differentiation. Specifically, we cast the equilibria as the solutions to
variational inequalities (VIs). The explicit approach unrolls the projection
method for solving VIs, while the implicit approach exploits the sensitivity of
the solutions to VIs. At the core of both approaches is the differentiation
through a projection operator. Moreover, we establish the correctness of both
approaches and identify the conditions under which one approach is more
desirable than the other. The analytical results are validated using several

the Blind Oracular Quantum Computation (BOQC) scheme, in which the oracle is a
distinct node in a quantum network. Our work augments the client-server setting
of quantum computing, in which a powerful quantum computer server is available
on the network for discreet use by clients on the network with low quantum

client so that an oracular quantum algorithm is run on the server. The
cooperation between the main client and the oracle takes place (almost) without
communication. We prove BOQC to be blind: the server cannot learn anything
about the clients' computation. This proof is performed within the composable
security definitions provided by the formalism of Abstract Cryptography. We
enhance the BOQC scheme to be runnable with minimal physical qubits when run on

commonly used for high-throughput, quantitative measurements of the proteome
(i.e. the set of all proteins in a sample at a given time). Targeted LC-MS
produces data in the form of a two-dimensional time series spectrum, with the
mass to charge ratio of analytes (m/z) on one axis, and the retention time from
the chromatography on the other. The elution of a peptide of interest produces
highly specific patterns across multiple fragment ion traces (extracted ion
chromatograms, or XICs). In this paper, we formulate this peak detection
problem as a multivariate time series segmentation problem, and propose a novel
approach based on the Transformer architecture. Here we augment Transformers,
which are capable of capturing long distance dependencies with a global view,
with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which can capture local context
important to the task at hand, in the form of Transformers with Convolutional
Self-Attention. We further train this model in a semisupervised manner by
adapting state of the art semisupervised image classification techniques for
multi-channel time series data. Experiments on a representative LC-MS dataset
are benchmarked using manual annotations to showcase the encouraging
performance of our method; it outperforms baseline neural network architectures
and is competitive against the current state of the art in automated peak
detection.

predictions of current hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy formation. We aim to

dependence of their intrinsic 3D shape distributions in the COSMOS galaxy
survey below redshift $z=1.0$. This distribution is inferred from the observed
distribution of 2D shapes, using a reconstruction method which we test using
hydrodynamic simulations. Our tests reveal a moderate bias for the inferred
average disc circularity and relative thickness, but a large bias on the
dispersion of these quantities. Applying the reconstruction method on COSMOS
data, we find variations of the average disc circularity and relative thickness
with redshift of around $\sim1\%$ and $\sim10\%$ respectively, which is
comparable to the error estimates on these quantities. The average relative
disc thickness shows a significant mass dependence which can be accounted for
by the scaling of disc radius with galaxy mass. We conclude that our data
provides no evidence for a strong dependence of the average circularity and
absolute thickness of disc-dominated galaxies on redshift and mass that is
significant with respect to the statistical uncertainties in our analysis.
These findings are expected in the absence of disruptive merging or feedback
events that would affect galaxy shapes. They hence support a scenario where
present-day discs form early ($z>1.0$) and subsequently undergo a tranquil
evolution in isolation. However, more data and a better understanding of
systematics are needed to reaffirm our results.

Using Jensen's inequality and the characteristics of wireless channels, a lower

of this work are to assess the capability of linear elasticity (Young's
modulus) or hyperelasticity in predicting hypobaric pressure induced 3D
stretching of the skin. Using experiments and computational Finite Element
Method modelling, this work demonstrated that although it was possible to
predict the suction dome apex height using both linear elasticity and
hyperelasticity for the typical range of hypobaric pressure in medical
applications (up to -10 psi), linear elasticity theory showed limitations when
predicting the strain distribution across the suction dome. The reason is that
the stretch ratio reaches values exceeding the initial linear elastic stage of
the stress-strain characteristic curve for skin. As a result, the linear
elasticity theory overpredicts the stretch along the rim of domes where there
is stress concentration. In addition, the modelling showed that the skin was
compressed consistently along the thickness direction, leading to reduced
thickness. Using hyperelasticity modelling to predict the 3D strain
distribution paves the way to accurately design safe commercial products that
interface with skin.

near-infrared (NIR) spectral parameters are used to investigate evidence of
space-weathering or mineralogical differences from the expected basaltic
composition. Based on the analysis of their visible spectra, we confirm 11 new
V-type asteroids: six low-i asteroids - (3188) Jekabsons, (3331) Kvistaberg,
(4693) Drummond, (7223) Dolgorukij, (9007) James Bond, and (29733) 1999 BA4;

candidates based on their visible + NIR spectra. We confirm the diogenite-like
composition of (2452) Lyot. The spectrum of asteroid (7302) is inconsistent
with a basaltic composition and likely reflects an S-type body. The spectrum of
(14390) 1990 QP$_{10}$ shows unique features that suggest a peculiar,
unclassified composition. Overall, our results demonstrate the efficiency of
the MOVIS catalogue in identifying V-type objects, with a success rate of over
85\%. The identification of V-types in the inner main-belt is more likely due
to the presence of the Vesta family and other nearby asteroids that had escaped

machine translation models operating at the high end of the performance
spectrum. As a side product of the data annotation process necessary for
building such models we propose sentence level accuracy $SACC$ as a simple,
self-explanatory evaluation metric for quality of translation.
  Experiments on two different annotator pools, one comprised of non-expert
(crowd-sourced) and one of expert (professional) translators show that $SACC$
can vary greatly depending on the translation proficiency of the annotators,
despite the fact that both pools are about equally reliable according to
Krippendorff's alpha metric; the relatively low values of inter-annotator
agreement confirm the expectation that sentence-level binary labeling $good$ /
$needs\ work$ for translation out of context is very hard.
  For an English-Spanish translation model operating at $SACC = 0.89$ according
to a non-expert annotator pool we can derive a confidence estimate that labels
0.5-0.6 of the $good$ translations in an ""in-domain"" test set with 0.95
Precision. Switching to an expert annotator pool decreases $SACC$ dramatically:
$0.61$ for English-Spanish, measured on the exact same data as above. This
forces us to lower the CE model operating point to 0.9 Precision while labeling
correctly about 0.20-0.25 of the $good$ translations in the data.
  We find surprising the extent to which CE depends on the level of proficiency
of the annotator pool used for labeling the data. This leads to an important
recommendation we wish to make when tackling CE modeling in practice: it is
critical to match the end-user expectation for translation quality in the
desired domain with the demands of annotators assigning binary quality labels
to CE training data.

XGB is the most robust model for classification, while ANN performs the best
for combined classification and redshift. The inference results are tested
using number counts, Gaia parallaxes, and other quasar catalogs. Based on these

best purity versus completeness trade-off: p(QSO_cand) > 0.9 for r < 22 and
p(QSO_cand) > 0.98 for 22 < r < 23.5. We find 158,000 quasar candidates in the

fainter by one magnitude than the training set. The photometric redshifts were

of cloning a biometric in real-time to securely identify the root of trust of a

macroscopic end charge of a truncated one-dimensional insulator, modulo the
charge quantum $e$, from a knowledge of bulk properties alone. A more subtle
problem is the determination of the corner charge of a two-dimensional
insulator, modulo $e$, from a knowledge of bulk and edge properties alone.
While previous works have tended to focus on the quantization of corner charge
in the presence of symmetries, here we focus on the case that the only bulk
symmetry is inversion, so that the corner charge can take arbitrary values. We
develop a Wannier-based formalism that allows the corner charge to be
predicted, modulo $e$, only from calculations on ribbon geometries of two
different orientations. We elucidate the dependence of the interior quadrupole
and edge dipole contributions upon the gauge used to construct the Wannier
functions, finding that while these are individually gauge-dependent, their sum
is gauge-independent. From this we conclude that the edge polarization is not
by itself a physical observable, and that any Wannier-based method for
computing the corner charge requires the use of a common gauge throughout the
calculation. We satisfy this constraint using two Wannier construction
procedures, one based on projection and another based on a gauge-consistent
nested Wannier construction. We validate our theory by demonstrating the
correct prediction of corner charge for several tight-binding models. We
comment on the relations between our approach and previous ones that have
appeared in the literature.

to input, such as analyzing the mutual information between nodes and data sets.
Yet DNNs can also be examined at the level of causation, exploring ""what does
what"" within the layers of the network itself. Historically, analyzing the
causal structure of DNNs has received less attention than understanding their
responses to input. Yet definitionally, generalizability must be a function of
a DNN's causal structure since it reflects how the DNN responds to unseen or
even not-yet-defined future inputs. Here, we introduce a suite of metrics based
on information theory to quantify and track changes in the causal structure of
DNNs during training. Specifically, we introduce the effective information (EI)
of a feedforward DNN, which is the mutual information between layer input and
output following a maximum-entropy perturbation. The EI can be used to assess
the degree of causal influence nodes and edges have over their downstream
targets in each layer. We show that the EI can be further decomposed in order
to examine the sensitivity of a layer (measured by how well edges transmit
perturbations) and the degeneracy of a layer (measured by how edge overlap
interferes with transmission), along with estimates of the amount of integrated
information of a layer. Together, these properties define where each layer lies
in the ""causal plane"" which can be used to visualize how layer connectivity
becomes more sensitive or degenerate over time, and how integration changes
during training, revealing how the layer-by-layer causal structure
differentiates. These results may help in understanding the generalization
capabilities of DNNs and provide foundational tools for making DNNs both more

conductivities of metals. Recent experiments observed small Lorenz ratios in
the compensated metal WP$_2$, indicating that charge flow is strongly favored
over heat conduction. Motivated by these findings, we study transport
properties of compensated metals in the presence of electron-electron
collisions and electron-impurity scattering. We focus on intermediate
temperatures, where the phonon contributions to transport are weak and elastic
and inelastic scattering rates are comparable. Our exact solution for the
kinetic equation in the presence of general Fermi-liquid interactions is used
to extract the Lorenz ratio for short and long range interactions. We find that
the Lorenz ratio develops a temperature dependence and gets enhanced as a
consequence of disorder scattering. For collisions mediated by the Coulomb
interaction, impurities give rise to a non-monotonic dependence of the Lorenz
ratio on the screening wave number with a minimum for intermediate screening
strength. To help future experimental efforts, we establish a scheme to connect
the exact results with the solution of the Boltzmann equation under the
relaxation time approximation for all collision integrals. Our recipe provides
simple phenomenological expressions for the transport coefficients and it

computation by manipulating a domain wall (DW), a transition region between
magnetic domains. But, these devices have suffered from challenges: spin
transfer torque (STT) switching of a DW requires high current, and the multiple
etch steps needed to create an MTJ pillar on top of a DW track has led to
reduced tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). These issues have limited experimental
study of devices and circuits. Here, we study prototypes of three-terminal
domain wall-magnetic tunnel junction (DW-MTJ) in-memory computing devices that
can address data processing bottlenecks and resolve these challenges by using
perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching, and
an optimized lithography process to produce average device tunnel

different verification tasks for tree ensemble models like random forests (RFs)

lower and upper bounds when the optimization problem cannot be solved exactly.
In contrast, many existing methods have focused on exact solutions and are thus
limited by the verification problem being NP-complete. Second, Veritas produces
full (bounded suboptimal) solutions that can be used to generate concrete

to ionize molecules for various gas-phase chemical studies. A convenient table
top source of 118 nm light can be produced by frequency tripling 355 nm light
from a Nd:YAG laser in xenon gas. This process has a low efficiency, typically
producing only nJ/pulse of VUV light. Simple models of the tripling process
predict the power of 118 nm light produced should increase quadratically with
increasing xenon pressure. However, experimental 118 nm production has been
observed to reach a maximum and then decrease to zero with increasing xenon
pressure. Here, we describe the basic theory and experimental setup for
producing 118 nm light and a new proposed model for the mechanism limiting the
production based on pressure broadened absorption.

  Monotonicity, Convexity and Condensate Fraction",,,,,"math-ph cond-mat.quant-gas math.AP math.MP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a recent paper we studied an equation (called the ""simple equation"")
introduced by one of us in 1963 for an approximate correlation function
associated to the ground state of an interacting Bose gas. Solving the equation
yields a relation between the density $\rho$ of the gas and the energy per
particle. Our construction of solutions gave a well-defined function $\rho(e)$
for the density as a function of the energy $e$. We had conjectured that
$\rho(e)$ is a strictly monotone increasing function, so that it can be
inverted to yield the strictly monotone increasing function $e(\rho)$. We had
also conjectured that $\rho e(\rho)$ is convex as a function of $\rho$. We
prove both conjectures here for small densities, the context in which they have
the most physical relevance, and the monotonicity also for large densities.
Both conjectures are grounded in the underlying physics, and their proof
provides further mathematical evidence for the validity of the assumptions
underlying the derivation of the simple equation, at least for low or high
densities, if not intermediate densities, although the equation gives
surprisingly good predictions for all densities $\rho$. Another problem left
open in our previous paper was whether the simple equation could be used to
compute accurate predictions of observables other than the energy. Here, we
provide a recipe for computing predictions for any one- or two-particle
observables for the ground state of the Bose gas. We focus on the condensate
fraction and the momentum distribution, and show that they have the same low
density asymptotic behavior as that predicted for the Bose gas. Along with the
computation of the low density energy of the simple equation in our previous
paper, this shows that the simple equation reproduces the known and conjectured
properties of the Bose gas at low densities.

role in various atmospheric and surface processes on Titan. The surface energy,
one important physical properties of the haze, is crucial for understanding the
growth of the haze particles and can be used to predict their wetting behavior
with solid and liquid species on Titan. We produced Titan analog haze
materials, so-called ""tholin"", with different energy sources and measured their
surface energies through contact angle and direct force measurements. From the
contact angle measurement, we found that the tholins produced by cold plasma
and UV irradiation have total surface energy around 60-70 mJ/m2. The direct
force measurement yields a total surface energy of ~66 mJ/m2 for plasma tholin.
The surface energy of tholin is relatively high compared to common polymers,
indicating its high cohesiveness. Therefore, the Titan haze particles would
likely coagulate easily to form bigger particles, while the haze-derived
surface sand particles would need higher wind speed to be mobilized because of
the high interparticle cohesion. The high surface energy of tholins also makes
them easily wettable by Titan's atmospheric hydrocarbon condensates and surface
liquids. Thus, the hazes particles are likely good cloud condensation nuclei
(CCN) for hydrocarbon clouds (methane and ethane) to nucleate and grow. And if
the hazes particles are denser compared to the lake liquids, they would likely
sink into the lakes instead of forming a floating film to dampen the lake
surface waves.

undergoing some changes. The applications are wide-ranging and include for
example matchings, shortest paths, linear programming, semi-definite
programming, convex hull and volume computation. Given the wide range of
applications, the exact property these data structures must maintain varies
from one application to another, forcing algorithm designers to invent them
from scratch or modify existing ones. Thus it is not surprising that these data
structures and their proofs are usually tailor-made for their specific
application and that maintaining more complicated properties results in more
complicated proofs.
  In this paper we present a unifying framework that captures a wide range of
these data structures. The simplicity of this framework allows us to give short
proofs for many existing data structures regardless of how complicated the to
be maintained property is. We also show how the framework can be used to speed
up existing iterative algorithms, such as the simplex algorithm.
  More formally, consider any rational function $f(A_1,...,A_d)$ with input
matrices $A_1,...,A_d$. We show that the task of maintaining $f(A_1,...,A_d)$
under updates to $A_1,...,A_d$ can be reduced to the much simpler problem of
maintaining some matrix inverse $M^{-1}$ under updates to $M$. The latter is a
well studied problem called dynamic matrix inverse. By applying our reduction
and using known algorithms for dynamic matrix inverse we can obtain fast data
structures and iterative algorithms for much more general problems.

developers may incorporate refactorings in other development activities that go

developer interviews and a reduced set of projects. To cope with the
above-mentioned limitations, we aim to better understand what motivates

trained a multi-class classifier to categorize these commits into 3 categories,

traditional BugFix and Functional categories. This classification challenges
the original definition of refactoring, being exclusive to improving the design
and fixing code smells. Further, to better understand our classification
results, we analyzed commit messages to extract textual patterns that
developers regularly use to describe their refactorings. The results show that
(1) fixing code smells is not the main driver for developers to refactoring
their codebases. Refactoring is solicited for a wide variety of reasons, going
beyond its traditional definition; (2) the distribution of refactorings differs
between production and test files; (3) developers use several patterns to
purposefully target refactoring; (4) the textual patterns, extracted from
commit messages, provide better coverage for how developers document their

described by the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner model, suggesting a matrix
diffusion-controlled coarsening mechanism (rather than control by interfacial
coherency). Solutionising temperature was found to affect nucleation number
density with an activation energy of $E_{\mathrm{f}} = 1.5\pm{}0.4$~eV,

account for a small proportion of heritability. Challenges remain to discover
additional variants contributing to complex diseases. Expectile regression is a
generalization of linear regression and provides completed information on the
conditional distribution of a phenotype of interest. While expectile regression
has many nice properties and holds great promise for genetic data analyses
(e.g., investigating genetic variants predisposing to a high-risk population),
it has been rarely used in genetic research. In this paper, we develop an

relationships between genetic variants and disease phenotypes and can be used
to discover genetic variants predisposing to sub-populations (e.g., high-risk

capable of capturing non-linear and non-additive genetic effects (e.g.,
gene-gene interactions). Through simulations, we showed that the proposed

relative differences may better represent such benefits. In this paper, we

electrodynamics in which the gauge potential is a higher-rank differential
form. As in the Maxwell theory, there is a choice of boundary conditions with
an infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry group. For higher $p$-form theories
on $(2p+2)$-dimensional flat spacetime, the surface charges are classified by
the Hodge decomposition of gauge parameters on $2p$-sphere into exact and
co-exact charges. For the exact parameters which are special features of
higher-form theories, the surface charges are non-commuting. In presence of
$p$-branes, there are non-trivial zero-mode charges analogous to the electric
charge for point particles. Although our $p$-form discussion is restricted to
$2p+2$ dimensions, we generalize the study of Maxwell theory not only to
general dimensions but also to the anti-de Sitter background. Finally,
motivated by the IR triangle of gauge theories that relate asymptotic
symmetries, memory effects, and soft theorems, we introduce a new kind of
memory effect exerted on the internal modes of closed and open strings. On
closed string probes, soft 2-form radiation rotates left- and right-moving
modes oppositely, which amounts to a unit shift in the spin of probe particles.
This provides the first instance of an `internal memory effect' on a non-local
object. We conclude by general remarks on the physical significance of soft
modes.

extension of the relation is unsound. To achieve our results, we develop a
novel session decomposition technique, from full session types (including
internal/external choices) into single input/output session trees (without
choices). Previous work studies precise subtyping for binary sessions (with
just two participants), or multiparty sessions (with any number of
participants) and synchronous interaction. Here, we cover multiparty sessions
with asynchronous interaction, where messages are transmitted via FIFO queues
(as in the TCP/IP protocol), and prove that our subtyping is both operationally
and denotationally precise. In the asynchronous multiparty setting, finding the
precise subtyping relation is a highly complex task: this is because, under
some conditions, participants can permute the order of their inputs and
outputs, by sending some messages earlier or receiving some later, without
causing errors; the precise subtyping relation must capture all such valid
permutations -- and consequently, its formalisation, reasoning and proofs
become challenging. Our session decomposition technique overcomes this
complexity, expressing the subtyping relation as a composition of refinement
relations between single input/output trees, and providing a simple reasoning

  Haeffele","A novel variational form of the Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm with $p\in(0,1)$ has recently gained considerable
attention in various low-rank matrix estimation problems offering significant
benefits over relevant convex heuristics such as the nuclear norm. However, due
to the nonconvexity of the Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm, minimization suffers from
two major drawbacks: 1) the lack of theoretical guarantees and 2) the high
computational cost which is demanded for the minimization task even for trivial
tasks such as finding stationary points. In an attempt to reduce the high
computational cost induced by Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm minimization, variational
forms, which are defined over smaller-size matrix factors whose product equals
the original matrix, have been proposed. Here, we propose and analyze a novel
variational form of Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm which, for the first time in the
literature, is defined for any continuous value of $p\in(0,1]$ and decouples
along the columns of the factorized matrices. The proposed form can be
considered as the natural generalization of the well-known variational form of
the nuclear norm to the nonconvex case i.e., for $p\in(0,1)$. The resulting
formulation gives way to SVD-free algorithms thus offering lower computational
complexity than the one that is induced by the original definition of the
Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm. A local optimality analysis is provided which
shows~that we can arrive at a local minimum of the original Schatten-$p$
quasi-norm problem by reaching a local minimum of the matrix factorization
based surrogate problem. In addition, for the case of the squared Frobenius
loss with linear operators obeying the restricted isometry property (RIP), a
rank-one update scheme is proposed, which offers a way to escape poor local
minima. Finally, the efficiency of our approach is empirically shown on a
matrix completion problem.

Unlike estimates of risk aversion based on the share of risky assets, our
statistical analysis suggests that the implied risk aversion coefficient of an
investor increases with her wealth and financial literacy. Portfolio
diversification, Sharpe ratio, and expected portfolio returns correlate
positively with the efficiency of the portfolio, whereas a higher standard

for standard and semistandard tableaux. The second main result states that the
set of rectangular $\delta$-semistandard tableaux for fixed $\delta$ and

Kostka polynomial. To do so we follow Fontaine-Kamnitzer and associate to
$(\delta,\gamma)$ an $SL_m$-invariant space
Inv$(V_{\lambda^1}\otimes\cdots\otimes V_{\lambda^n})$ where each
$V_{\lambda^i}$ is an alternating or symmetric representation. We show that the
Satake basis of the corresponding invariant space is indexed by the set of

tensor factors. We then diagonalize the rotation action using the fusion
product. This cyclic sieving generalizes the result of Rhoades, and of
Fontaine-Kamnitzer (in type A), and is closely related to that of Westbury.

are instances of QCPs induced by pressure or doping in itinerant moment

classical statistics, increasing the complexity of a model (e.g., number of
parameters) reduces bias but also increases variance. Until recently, it was
commonly believed that optimal performance is achieved at intermediate model
complexities which strike a balance between bias and variance. Modern Deep
Learning methods flout this dogma, achieving state-of-the-art performance using
""over-parameterized models"" where the number of fit parameters is large enough
to perfectly fit the training data. As a result, understanding bias and
variance in over-parameterized models has emerged as a fundamental problem in
machine learning. Here, we use methods from statistical physics to derive
analytic expressions for bias and variance in two minimal models of
over-parameterization (linear regression and two-layer neural networks with
nonlinear data distributions), allowing us to disentangle properties stemming
from the model architecture and random sampling of data. In both models,
increasing the number of fit parameters leads to a phase transition where the
training error goes to zero and the test error diverges as a result of the
variance (while the bias remains finite). Beyond this threshold, the test error
of the two-layer neural network decreases due to a monotonic decrease in
\emph{both} the bias and variance in contrast with the classical bias-variance
trade-off. We also show that in contrast with classical intuition,
over-parameterized models can overfit even in the absence of noise and exhibit
bias even if the student and teacher models match. We synthesize these results
to construct a holistic understanding of generalization error and the
bias-variance trade-off in over-parameterized models and relate our results to
random matrix theory.

convex and well-conditioned, gradient-based approaches can be extremely
effective, e.g., achieving the exponential rate of convergence. On the other
hand, the existing Lasso-type estimator in general cannot achieve the optimal
rate due to the undesirable behavior of the absolute function at the origin. A
homotopic method is to use a sequence of surrogate functions to approximate the
$\ell_1$ penalty that is used in the Lasso-type of estimators. The surrogate
functions will converge to the $\ell_1$ penalty in the Lasso estimator. At the
same time, each surrogate function is strictly convex, which enables a provable
faster numerical rate of convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate that by
meticulously defining the surrogate functions, one can prove a faster numerical
convergence rate than any existing methods in computing for the Lasso-type of
estimators. Namely, the state-of-the-art algorithms can only guarantee
$O(1/\epsilon)$ or $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ convergence rates, while we can prove
an $O([\log(1/\epsilon)]^2)$ for the newly proposed algorithm. Our numerical
simulations show that the new algorithm also performs better empirically.

continuous, high resolution outputs of arbitrary shape. Recent works represent
3D surfaces implicitly with a Neural Network, thereby breaking previous
barriers in resolution, and ability to represent diverse topologies. However,
neural implicit representations are limited to closed surfaces, which divide
the space into inside and outside. Many real world objects such as walls of a
scene scanned by a sensor, clothing, or a car with inner structures are not
closed. This constitutes a significant barrier, in terms of data pre-processing
(objects need to be artificially closed creating artifacts), and the ability to
output open surfaces. In this work, we propose Neural Distance Fields (NDF), a
neural network based model which predicts the unsigned distance field for
arbitrary 3D shapes given sparse point clouds. NDF represent surfaces at high
resolutions as prior implicit models, but do not require closed surface data,
and significantly broaden the class of representable shapes in the output. NDF
allow to extract the surface as very dense point clouds and as meshes. We also
show that NDF allow for surface normal calculation and can be rendered using a
slight modification of sphere tracing. We find NDF can be used for multi-target
regression (multiple outputs for one input) with techniques that have been
exclusively used for rendering in graphics. Experiments on ShapeNet show that
NDF, while simple, is the state-of-the art, and allows to reconstruct shapes
with inner structures, such as the chairs inside a bus. Notably, we show that
NDF are not restricted to 3D shapes, and can approximate more general open
surfaces such as curves, manifolds, and functions. Code is available for

use of origami folding to develop robotic jumping mechanisms with tailored
nonlinear stiffness to improve dynamic performance. Specifically, we use
Tachi-Miura Polyhedron (TMP) bellow origami -- which exhibits a nonlinear
""strain-softening"" force-displacement curve -- as a jumping robotic skeleton
with embedded energy storage. TMP's nonlinear stiffness allows it to store more
energy than a linear spring and offers improved jumping height and airtime.
Moreover, the nonlinearity can be tailored by directly changing the underlying
TMP crease geometry. A critical challenge is to minimize the TMP's hysteresis
and energy loss during its compression stage right before jumping. So we used
the plastically annealed lamina emergent origami (PALEO) concept to modify the
TMP creases. PALEO increases the folding limit before plastic deformation
occurs, thus improving the overall strain energy retention. Jumping experiments
confirmed that a nonlinear TMP mechanism achieved roughly 9% improvement in air
time and a 13% improvement in jumping height compared to a ""control"" TMP sample
with a relatively linear stiffness. This study's results validate the
advantages of using origami in robotic jumping mechanisms and demonstrate the
benefits of utilizing nonlinear spring elements for improving jumping
performance. Therefore, they could foster a new family of energetically

quarks in the lowest-energy state may lie predominantly in 1+1 dimensions, as
in a $d$-$u$-$d$ open string. The attractive $d$-$u$ and $u$-$d$ QED
interactions may overcome the weaker repulsive $d$-$d$ QED interaction to bind
the three quarks together. We examine the QED neutron in a phenomenological
three-body problem in 1+1 dimensions with an effective interaction extracted
from Schwinger's exact QED solution in 1+1 dimensions. The phenomenological
model in a variational calculation yields a stable QED neutron at 44.5 MeV. The
analogous QED proton with two $u$ quarks and a $d$ quark has been found to be
too repulsive to be stable and does not have a bound or continuum state, onto
which the QED neutron can decay via the weak interaction. Consequently, the QED
neutron is stable against the weak decay, has a long lifetime, and is in fact a
QED dark neutron. It may be produced following the deconfinement-to-confinement
phase transition of the quark gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.
Because of the long lifetime of the QED dark neutron, self-gravitating
assemblies of QED dark neutrons or dark antineutrons may be good candidates for
a part of the primordial dark matter produced during the phase transition of
the quark gluon plasma in the evolution of the early Universe.

applications of the VQE in various fields ranging from high energy physics to

the VQE to calculate such a symmetry-resolving energy spectrum, but systematic
analysis on the effect of the penalty term has been lacking, and the use of the
penalty term in the VQE has not been justified rigorously. In this work, we
investigate two major types of penalty terms for the VQE that were proposed in

determine the magnitude of the penalty term, which may lead to the faster
convergence of the VQE. Meanwhile, we prove that the other type of penalty
terms does not work for obtaining the target state with the desired symmetry in

finally provide numerical simulations to validate our analysis. Our results

framework that tackles two categories of discrepancies in EHRs collected from

procedures (systematic bias). Prior research in DA has mainly focused on
addressing covariate shift but not systematic bias. In this work, we propose an
adversarial domain separation framework that addresses both categories of
discrepancies by maintaining one globally-shared invariant latent
representation across all systems} through an adversarial learning process,
while also allocating a domain-specific model for each system to extract local
latent representations that cannot and should not be unified across systems.
Moreover, our proposed framework is based on variational recurrent neural
network (VRNN) because of its ability to capture complex temporal dependencies
and handling missing values in time-series data. We evaluate our framework for
early diagnosis of an extremely challenging condition, septic shock, using two
real-world EHRs from distinct medical systems in the U.S. The results show that
by separating globally-shared from domain-specific representations, our
framework significantly improves septic shock early prediction performance in
both EHRs and outperforms the current state-of-the-art DA models.

individual morphological characteristics weighted by normalized difference

effect in the power spectrum, which can be approximated by a constant window
function on large scales. The clustering bias of the volume statistic with

negative. We further identify the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) feature in

detect the stochastic gravitational-wave background (GWB) likely produced by
the collection of inspiralling super-massive black holes binaries, and
potentially constrain some exotic physics. So far most of the pulsar timing
data analysis has focused on the monopole of the GWB, assuming it is perfectly
isotropic. The natural next step is to search for anisotropies in the GWB. In
this paper, we use the recently developed PTA Fisher matrix to gain insights
into optimal search strategies for GWB anisotropies. For concreteness, we apply
our results to EPTA data, using realistic noise characteristics of its pulsars.
We project the detectability of a GWB whose angular dependence is assumed to be
a linear combination of predetermined maps, such as spherical harmonics or
coarse pixels. We find that the GWB monopole is always statistically correlated
with these maps, implying a loss of sensitivity to the monopole when searching
simultaneously for anisotropies. We then derive the angular distributions of
the GWB intensity to which a PTA is most sensitive, and illustrate how one may
use these ""principal maps"" to approximately reconstruct the angular dependence
of the GWB. Since the principal maps are neither perfectly anisotropic nor
uncorrelated with the monopole, we also develop a frequentist criterion to
specifically search for anisotropies in the GWB without any prior knowledge
about their angular distribution. Lastly, we show how to recover existing EPTA
results with our Fisher formalism, and clarify their meaning. The tools
presented here will be valuable in guiding and optimizing the computationally

(approximately 2-6 Rs) were thought to arise from the dynamic and intermittent

counterpart to outward-propagating streamer blobs, formed by magnetic
reconnection. This interpretation was essentially confirmed with the subsequent
identification of in/out pairs and the multispacecraft observations of their 3D

depletion form high in the corona and propagate inwards with sinuous motion
which has been characterized as `tadpole-like' in coronagraph imagery. The

  shapes","30 pages, 10 figures",,,,"math.DG math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we revisit the notion of length measures associated to planar
closed curves. These are a special case of area measures of hypersurfaces which
were introduced early on in the field of convex geometry. The length measure of
a curve is a measure on the circle $\mathbb{S}^1$ that intuitively represents
the length of the portion of curve which tangent vector points in a certain
direction. While a planar closed curve is not characterized by its length
measure, the fundamental Minkowski-Fenchel-Jessen theorem states that length
measures fully characterize convex curves modulo translations, making it a
particularly useful tool in the study of geometric properties of convex
objects. The present work, that was initially motivated by problems in shape
analysis, introduces length measures for the general class of Lipschitz
immersed and oriented planar closed curves, and derives some of the basic
properties of the length measure map on this class of curves. We then focus
specifically on the case of convex shapes and present several new results.
First, we prove an isoperimetric characterization of the unique convex curve
associated to some length measure given by the Minkowski-Fenchel-Jessen
theorem, namely that it maximizes the signed area among all the curves sharing
the same length measure. Second, we address the problem of constructing a
distance with associated geodesic paths between convex planar curves. For that
purpose, we introduce and study a new distance on the space of length measures
that corresponds to a constrained variant of the Wasserstein metric of optimal
transport, from which we can induce a distance between convex curves. We also
propose a primal-dual algorithm to numerically compute those distances and
geodesics, and show a few simple simulations to illustrate the approach.

altering the vertex magnetization. Moreover, we study differences between the

the LDW mode acts as a signature of the domain wall (DW) nucleation process and
the DW dynamics active during segment reversal events. The results show the VCM

in general, a recursive polynomial-time algorithm called TreeShap is available
for decision tree models. However, despite its polynomial time complexity,
TreeShap can become a significant bottleneck in practical machine learning

systems show a remarkable universal picture which can be understood partially
by combination of a semiclassical argument with the quantum effect of
(in)distinguishability. The universal R\'enyi entropies are independent of the
model, the quasiparticle momenta, and the connectedness of the subsystem. In
this letter we calculate exactly the single-interval and double-interval
R\'enyi entropies of quasiparticle excitations in the many-body gapped
fermions, bosons, and XY chains. We find additional contributions to the
universal R\'enyi entropy in the excited states with quasiparticles of
different momenta. The additional terms are different in the fermionic and
bosonic chains, depend on the momentum differences of the quasiparticles, and
are different for the single interval and the double interval. We derive the
analytical R\'enyi entropy in the extremely gapped limit, matching perfectly
the numerical results as long as either the intrinsic correlation length of the
model or all the de Broglie wavelengths of the quasiparticles are small. When
the momentum difference of any pair of distinct quasiparticles is small, the
additional terms are non-negligible. On the contrary, when the difference of
the momenta of each pair of distinct quasiparticles is large, the additional
terms could be neglected. The universal single-interval R\'enyi entropy and its
additional terms in the XY chain are the same as those in the fermionic chain,
while the universal R\'enyi entropy of the double intervals and its additional
terms are different, due to the fact that the local degrees of freedom of the
XY chain are the Pauli matrices not the spinless fermions. We argue that the
derived formulas have universal properties and can be applied for a wider range
of models than those discussed here.

The traffic generated by the APT organization, which is the organization that
launch the APT attack, has a high similarity, especially in the Command and

effectively improve the accuracy of traffic detection for APT attacks. This
paper analyzes the DNS and TCP traffic of the APT attack, and constructs two
new features, C2Load_fluct (response packet load fluctuation) and Bad_rate (bad

the temporal dynamics of dynamic samples. In DWS, dynamic samples scatter the
incident coherent light, and the information of the temporal dynamics is
encoded in the scattered light. To record and analyze the light signal, there
exist two types of methods - temporal sampling methods and speckle ensemble
methods. Temporal sampling methods, including diffuse correlation spectroscopy
(DCS), use one or multiple large bandwidth detectors to well sample and analyze
the temporal light signal to infer the sample temporal dynamics. Speckle
ensemble methods, including speckle visibility spectroscopy (SVS), use a
high-pixel-count camera sensor to capture a speckle pattern and use the speckle
contrast to infer sample temporal dynamics. In this paper, we theoretically and
experimentally demonstrate that the decorrelation time ({\tau}) measurement
accuracy or SNR of the two types of methods has a unified and similar
fundamental expression based on the number of independent observables (NIO) and
the photon flux. Given a time measurement duration, NIO in temporal sampling
methods is constrained by the measurement duration, while speckle ensemble
methods can outperform by using simultaneous sampling channels to scale up NIO
significantly. In the case of optical brain monitoring, the interplay of these
factors favors speckle ensemble methods. We illustrate that this important
engineering consideration is consistent with the previous research on blood
pulsatile flow measurements, where a speckle ensemble method operating at
100-fold lower photon flux than a conventional temporal sampling system can
achieve a comparable SNR.

hole from the brightest cluster galaxy in Abell 2261 (A2261-BCG). A2261-BCG is
a strong candidate for a recoiling black hole because of its large, flat
stellar core, revealed by Hubble Space Telescope imaging observations. We took
100-ksec observations with Chandra and combined it with 35 ksec of archival
observations to look for low-level accretion onto a black hole of expected mass
$M\sim10^{10}\ M_{\scriptscriptstyle \odot}$ that could possibly be located in
one of four off-center stellar knots near the galaxy's center or else in the
optical center of the galaxy or in the location of radio emission. We found no
X-ray emission arising from a point source in excess of the cluster gas and can
place limits on the accretion of any black hole in the central region to a 2-7
keV flux below $4.3 \times 10^{-16}\ \mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}\ cm^{-2}}$,
corresponding to a bolometric Eddington fraction of about $10^{-6}$. Thus there
is either no $10^{10}\ M_{\scriptscriptstyle \odot}$ black hole in the core of
A2261-BCG, or it is accreting at a low level. We also discuss the morphology of
the X-ray emitting gas in the cluster and how its asymmetry is consistent with
a large dynamic event.

Chit-chat settings. The majority of them rely on an encoder for understanding
the post and a decoder for generating the response. Without given assigned

semantic mapping between posts and responses is hidden on the fly within the
end-to-end manners. Some previous works utilize sampled latent words as a
controllable semantic form to drive the generated response around the work, but
few works attempt to use more complex semantic patterns to guide the
generation. In this paper, we propose to use more detailed semantic forms,
including latent responses and part-of-speech sequences sampled from the
corresponding distributions, as the controllable semantics to guide the

provide informative and diverse responses, but also increase the overall

ability of a learning algorithm. Among different notions of stability,
\emph{uniform stability} is arguably the most popular one, which yields
exponential generalization bounds. However, uniform stability only considers
the worst-case loss change (or so-called sensitivity) by removing a single data
point, which is distribution-independent and therefore undesirable. There are
many cases that the worst-case sensitivity of the loss is much larger than the
average sensitivity taken over the single data point that is removed,
especially in some advanced models such as random feature models or neural
networks. Many previous works try to mitigate the distribution independent
issue by proposing weaker notions of stability, however, they either only yield
polynomial bounds or the bounds derived do not vanish as sample size goes to
infinity. Given that, we propose \emph{locally elastic stability} as a weaker
and distribution-dependent stability notion, which still yields exponential
generalization bounds. We further demonstrate that locally elastic stability
implies tighter generalization bounds than those derived based on uniform
stability in many situations by revisiting the examples of bounded support
vector machines, regularized least square regressions, and stochastic gradient
descent.

Generation Spectral Library to simulate the CSST stellar spectra at $R = 250$,
and investigate their capabilities in measuring radial velocities. We find that
velocity uncertainties depend strongly on effective temperature, weakly on
metallicity for only FGK stars, and hardly on surface gravity. It is possible
to deliver stellar radial velocities to a precision of about $3
\,\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for AFGKM stars, and about $10

explored. Given the same SNR, the GU band performs best, the GV band the second
best, and then the GI band. The effects of spectral normalization and imperfect

The uncertainties caused by wavelength calibration are considered and found to
be moderate. Given the possible precision of radial velocities, the CSST

Here, we show that for many standard transductive node classification
benchmarks, we can exceed or match the performance of state-of-the-art GNNs by
combining shallow models that ignore the graph structure with two simple
post-processing steps that exploit correlation in the label structure: (i) an
""error correlation"" that spreads residual errors in training data to correct
errors in test data and (ii) a ""prediction correlation"" that smooths the
predictions on the test data. We call this overall procedure Correct and Smooth
(C&S), and the post-processing steps are implemented via simple modifications
to standard label propagation techniques from early graph-based semi-supervised
learning methods. Our approach exceeds or nearly matches the performance of
state-of-the-art GNNs on a wide variety of benchmarks, with just a small
fraction of the parameters and orders of magnitude faster runtime. For
instance, we exceed the best known GNN performance on the OGB-Products dataset
with 137 times fewer parameters and greater than 100 times less training time.
The performance of our methods highlights how directly incorporating label

blackouts. Therefore, it is crucial for system operators to be able to monitor
the state of the network in real-time and predict the maximum possible
frequency deviations at all times.
  This paper presents a real-time frequency stability (RTFS) tool developed by
the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) and operationalized in the control
room for the South West Interconnected System (SWIS) to ensure that the
available spinning reserve is sufficient and fast enough to arrest frequency
excursions under any conditions, and particularly low-inertia ones. To reduce
the computational burden and complexity of the different turbine-governor

been used for each of the generator. These adjustable parameters, along with
other key model parameters such as load damping and inertia, have been
calibrated against actual frequency response using high-speed fault recorder
data from historical events. As demonstrated in several case studies, the
real-time tool has proven to be accurate at predicting the trajectory of system
frequency after credible contingencies, thus suggesting that similar
implementations could be carried out elsewhere while power systems worldwide

build task-specific models (student models) without significantly incurring
training costs using a single powerful model (teacher model) pre-trained with a
large amount of data. The teacher model may contain private data, or interact
with private inputs. We investigate if one can leak or infer such private
information without interacting with the teacher model directly. We describe
such inference attacks in the context of face recognition, an application of
transfer learning that is highly sensitive to personal privacy.
  Under black-box and realistic settings, we show that existing inference
techniques are ineffective, as interacting with individual training instances
through the student models does not reveal information about the teacher. We
then propose novel strategies to infer from aggregate-level information.
Consequently, membership inference attacks on the teacher model are shown to be
possible, even when the adversary has access only to the student models.
  We further demonstrate that sensitive attributes can be inferred, even in the
case where the adversary has limited auxiliary information. Finally, defensive
strategies are discussed and evaluated. Our extensive study indicates that
information leakage is a real privacy threat to the transfer learning framework
widely used in real-life situations.

This results in mixed-sensitivity concurrent programs, which might reuse memory
shared between their threads to hold data of different sensitivity levels at
different times; for such programs, a compiler must preserve the
value-dependent coordination of such mixed-sensitivity reuse despite the impact
of concurrency.
  Here we demonstrate, using Isabelle/HOL, that it is feasible to verify that a
compiler preserves noninterference, the strictest kind of confidentiality
property, for mixed-sensitivity concurrent programs. First, we present notions
of refinement that preserve a concurrent value-dependent notion of
noninterference that we have designed to support such programs. As proving
noninterference-preserving refinement can be considerably more complex than the
standard refinements typically used to verify semantics-preserving compilation,
our notions include a decomposition principle that separates the
semantics-preservation from security-preservation concerns. Second, we
demonstrate that these refinement notions are applicable to verified secure
compilation, by exercising them on a single-pass compiler for mixed-sensitivity
concurrent programs that synchronise using mutex locks, from a generic
imperative language to a generic RISC-style assembly language. Finally, we
execute our compiler on a nontrivial mixed-sensitivity concurrent program
modelling a real-world use case, thus preserving its source-level
noninterference properties down to an assembly-level model automatically.

mesh of multiple body parts (e.g., body, hands) with large-scale differences
from a single RGB image. Existing methods are mostly based on iterative
optimization, which is very time-consuming. We propose to train a single-shot
model to achieve this goal. The main challenge is lacking training data that
have complete 3D annotations of all body parts in 2D images. To solve this
problem, we design a multi-branch framework to disentangle the regression of
different body properties, enabling us to separate each component's training in
a synthetic training manner using unpaired data available. Besides, to
strengthen the generalization ability, most existing methods have used
in-the-wild 2D pose datasets to supervise the estimated 3D pose via 3D-to-2D
projection. However, we observe that the commonly used weak-perspective model
performs poorly in dealing with the external foreshortening effect of camera
projection. Therefore, we propose a depth-to-scale (D2S) projection to
incorporate the depth difference into the projection function to derive
per-joint scale variants for more proper supervision. The proposed method
outperforms previous methods on the CMU Panoptic Studio dataset according to
the evaluation results and achieves comparable results on the Human3.6M body

images gets significantly improved using the proposed D2S projection for weak
supervision, while maintains obvious superiority in computational efficiency.

excavator trajectory generation under various objectives, including minimum
joint displacement and minimum time. Traditional methods on excavation
trajectory generation usually separate the excavation motion into a sequence of
fixed phases, resulting in limited trajectory searching space. Our framework
explores the space of all possible excavation trajectories represented with
waypoints interpolated by a polynomial spline, thereby enabling optimization
over a larger searching space. We formulate a generic task specification for
excavation by constraining the instantaneous motion of the bucket and further
add a target-oriented constraint, i.e. swept volume that indicates the
estimated amount of excavated materials. To formulate time related objectives
and constraints, we introduce time intervals between waypoints as variables
into the optimization framework. We implement the proposed framework and
evaluate its performance on a UR5 robotic arm. The experimental results
demonstrate that the generated trajectories are able to excavate sufficient
mass of soil for different terrain shapes and have 60% shorter minimal length
than traditional excavation methods. We further compare our one-stage time
optimal trajectory generation with the two-stage method. The result shows that
trajectories generated by our one-stage method cost 18% less time on average.

bursts (FRBs), namely, FRB 20180916B and FRB 20180814A, and combine the results
with those from our earlier analysis on FRB 20121102A. The relationship between
the frequency drift rate, or slope, of individual sub-bursts and their temporal
duration is investigated. We consider a broad sample of possible dispersion
measure (DM) values for each source to understand the range of valid sub-burst
slope and duration measurements for all bursts and to constrain our results. We
find good agreement with an inverse scaling law between the two parameters
previously predicted using a simple dynamical relativistic model. The
remarkably similar behaviour observed in all sources provides strong evidence
that a single and common underlying physical phenomenon is responsible for the
emission of signals from these three FRBs, despite their associations with
different types of host galaxies at various redshifts. It also opens up the
possibility that this sub-burst slope law may be a universal property among
repeating FRBs, or indicates a distinct subclass among them.

target band near the Fermi level. Here, we apply the constrained random-phase
approximation (cRPA) and constrained functional renormalization group (cfRG),
which can go beyond cRPA by including all one-loop diagrams, to calculate and
compare the effective interactions of the three-band Emery model, which is
often used to investigate cuprate high-temperature superconductors. At half
band filling, we find that the effective interaction increases as the charge
transfer energy ($\Delta_{dp}$) increases and similar behavior is obtained as a
function of the interatomic 2$p$-3$d$ interaction ($U_{dp}$). However, the
effective interaction is more sensitive to $\Delta_{dp}$ than $ U_{dp}$. For
most of the parameter sets, the effective static interaction is overscreened in
cRPA compared to cfRG. The low-energy models at half-filling are solved within
dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The results show that despite the different
static interactions, the systems with cRPA and cfRG interaction exhibit a Mott
transition at similar values of $\Delta_{dp}$. We also investigate the
effective interaction as a function of doping. The cfRG effective interaction
decreases as the electron number increases and displays a trend opposite to
that of cRPA. Antiscreening is observed for the hole-doped case. For all the
cases studied, the near-cancellation of the direct particle-hole channel is
observed. This indicates that at least for the downfolding of the onsite
interaction terms, methods beyond cRPA may be required.

nodes of a network into low-dimensional vectors. While fairly successful, most
existing works focus on the embedding techniques for static networks. But in
practice, there are many networks that are evolving over time and hence are
dynamic, e.g., the social networks. To address this issue, a high-order
spatio-temporal embedding model is developed to track the evolutions of dynamic
networks. Specifically, an activeness-aware neighborhood embedding method is
first proposed to extract the high-order neighborhood information at each given
timestamp. Then, an embedding prediction framework is further developed to
capture the temporal correlations, in which the attention mechanism is employed
instead of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for its efficiency in computing and
flexibility in modeling. Extensive experiments are conducted on four real-world
datasets from three different areas. It is shown that the proposed method
outperforms all the baselines by a substantial margin for the tasks of dynamic
link prediction and node classification, which demonstrates the effectiveness
of the proposed methods on tracking the evolutions of dynamic networks.

liquid mixing ability between constituent elements, MeltNet achieves overall
success in prediction, especially capturing subtle composition-dependent

the ensemble method with uncertainty quantification. Based on the

to FAQ retrieval typically rank question-answer pairs by considering either the
similarity between the query and a question (q-Q), the relevance between the
query and the associated answer of a question (q-A), or combining the clues
gathered from the q-Q similarity measure and the q-A relevance measure. In this
paper, we extend this line of research by combining the clues gathered from the
q-Q similarity measure and the q-A relevance measure and meanwhile injecting
extra word interaction information, distilled from a generic (open domain)
knowledge base, into a contextual language model for inferring the q-A
relevance. Furthermore, we also explore to capitalize on domain-specific
topically-relevant relations between words in an unsupervised manner, acting as
a surrogate to the supervised domain-specific knowledge base information. As
such, it enables the model to equip sentence representations with the knowledge
about domain-specific and topically-relevant relations among words, thereby
providing a better q-A relevance measure. We evaluate variants of our approach
on a publicly-available Chinese FAQ dataset, and further apply and
contextualize it to a large-scale question-matching task, which aims to search
questions from a QA dataset that have a similar intent as an input query.
Extensive experimental results on these two datasets confirm the promising

problem of distributed submodular maximization, in which each agent determines
its own strategy from a finite set so that the global submodular objective
function is jointly maximized. Building on the multi-linear extension of the
global submodular function, we expect to achieve the solution from a
probabilistic, rather than deterministic, perspective, and thus transfer the
considered problem from a discrete domain into a continuous domain. Since it is
observed that an unbiased estimation of the gradient of multi-linear extension
function~can be obtained by sampling the agents' local decisions, a projected
stochastic gradient algorithm is proposed to solve the problem. Our algorithm
enables the distributed updates among all individual agents and is proved to
asymptotically converge to a desirable equilibrium solution. Such an
equilibrium solution is guaranteed to achieve at least 1/2-suboptimal bound,
which is comparable to the state-of-art in the literature. Moreover, we further
enhance the proposed algorithm by handling the scenario in which agents'
communication delays are present. The enhanced algorithmic framework admits a
more realistic distributed implementation of our approach. Finally, a movie

and high-resolution data from the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) to study the
formation, structure, and evolution of an atypical light bridge (LB) in a
regular sunspot. The LB results from the emergence of magnetic flux with one
footpoint rooted in a pore outside the parent sunspot that appears about 17 hrs
before the LB. The pore has a polarity opposite to that of the sunspot and
recedes away from it at a speed of about 0.4 km/s. This is accompanied by the
development of an elongated magnetic channel in the outer penumbra which
triggers the formation of the LB when it reaches the inner penumbral boundary.
The LB is a nearly horizontal structure with a field strength of about 1.2 kG
that exhibits long-lived photospheric blue-shifts of about 0.85 km/s along its
entire length.The emergence of the LB leads to dynamic surges in the
chromosphere and transition region about 13 min later. We derived the
photospheric and chromospheric structure of the LB in the DST data from
spectral line parameters and inversions of He i at 1083 nm, Si i at 1082.7 nm,
Ca ii IR at 854 nm and Halpha at 656 nm, and speckle-reconstructed imaging at
700 nm and 430 nm. The LB shows an elongated filamentary shape in the
photosphere without lateral extrusions. The thermal inversion of Ca ii IR
reveals the LB to be about 600-800 K hotter than the umbra. Different sections
of the LB are elevated to heights between 400 and 700 km. Our results indicate
that the LB formation is part of a flux emergence event with the LB envelope
reaching a height of about 29 Mm before dissolving after about 13 hr. We
suggest that the existence of persistent, large-scale photospheric blue-shifts
in LBs is the most likely criterion to distinguish between flux emergence
events and overturning convection in field-free umbral intrusions.

design a Q-learning algorithm that uses data collected in discrete time without

equations (P-PDEs) with deep learning (DL). P-PDEs arise in many important
application areas and the computational cost using traditional numerical
schemes can be exorbitant, especially when the parameters fall into a
particular range and the underlying PDE is required to be solved with high
accuracy. Recently, solving PDEs with DL has become an emerging field. Existing
works demonstrate great potentials of the DL based approach in speeding up
numerical solutions of PDEs. However, there is still limited research on the DL
approach for P-PDEs. If we directly apply existing supervised learning models
to P-PDEs, the models need to be constantly fine-tuned or retrained when the
parameters change. This drastically limits the applicability and utility of
these models in practice. To resolve this issue, we propose a
meta-learning-based method that can efficiently solve P-PDEs with a wide range
of parameters without retraining. Our key observation is to regard training a
solver for the P-PDE with a given set of parameters as a learning task. Then,
training a solver for the P-PDEs with varied parameters can be viewed as a
multi-task learning problem, to which meta-learning is one of the most
effective approaches. This new perspective can be applied to many existing PDE
solvers. As an example, we adopt the Multigrid Network (MgNet) as the base
solver. To achieve multi-task learning, we introduce a new hypernetwork, called
Meta-NN, in MgNet and refer to the entire network as the Meta-MgNet. Meta-NN
takes the differential operators and the right-hand-side of the underlying
P-PDEs as inputs and generates appropriate smoothers for MgNet which can
significantly affect the convergent speed. Finally, extensive numerical
experiments demonstrate that Meta-MgNet is more efficient in solving P-PDEs
than the MG methods and MgNet.

wind nebula (PWN). The termination shock of the PWN compresses the
Poynting-flux-dominated flow and drives magnetic reconnection. By carrying out
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of the termination shock of the PWN, we
study the shock structure as well as the energy conversion processes and
particle acceleration mechanisms. With the recent advances in the numerical
methods, we extend the simulations to the ultra-relativistic regime with bulk
Lorentz factor up to \gamma_{0}=10^{6}. Magnetic reconnection at the
termination shock is highly efficient at converting magnetic energy to particle
kinetic energy and accelerating particles to high energies. We find that the
resulting energy spectra crucially depend on \lambda/d_{e}. When \lambda/d_{e}
is large (\lambda\gtrsim40d_{e}) , the downstream particle spectra form a
power-law distribution in the magnetically dominated relativistic wind regime
with upstream magnetization parameter \sigma_{0}=10. By analyzing particle
trajectories and statistical quantities relevant to particle energization, we
find that Fermi-type mechanism dominates the particle acceleration and
power-law formation. We find that the results for particle acceleration are
scalable as \gamma_{0} and \sigma_{0} increase to large values. The maximum
energy for electrons and positrons can reach hundreds of TeV if the wind has a
bulk Lorentz factor \gamma_{0}\approx10^{6} and magnetization parameter
\sigma_{0}=10, which can explain the recent observations of high-energy

We show how the period of such structures in steel can be tuned over a wide
range by controlling the complex interaction mechanisms triggered in the
material. Amongst the different irradiation parameters that influence the
properties of the induced structures, the angle of incidence of the laser beam
occupies a prominent role. We present an experimental and theoretical
investigation of this angle dependence in steel upon irradiation with laser
pulses of 120 fs duration and 800 nm wavelength, while moving the sample at
constant speed. Our findings can be grouped into two blocks. First, we observe
the spatial coexistence of two different ripple periods at the steel surface,
both featuring inverse scaling upon angle increase, which are related to
forward and backward propagation of surface plasmon polaritons. To understand
the underlying physical phenomena, we extend a recently developed model that
takes into account quantitative properties of the surface roughness to the case
of absorbing metals (large imaginary part of the dielectric function), and
obtain an excellent match with the experimentally observed angle dependence. As
second important finding, we observe a quill writing effect, also termed
non-reciprocal writing, in form of a significant change of the ripple period
upon reversing the sample movement direction. This remarkable phenomenon has
been observed so far only inside dielectric materials and our work underlines
its importance also in laser surface processing. We attribute the origin of
symmetry breaking to the non-symmetric micro- and nanoscale roughness induced
upon static multiple pulse irradiation, leading to non-symmetric modification
of the wavevector of the coupled surface plasmon polariton.

number of people worldwide, posing significant stress to the health care
systems. Early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is critical in screening of
infected patients and breaking the person-to-person transmission. Chest X-ray
(CXR) based computer-aided diagnosis of COVID-19 using deep learning becomes a
promising solution to this end. However, the diverse and various radiographic
features of COVID-19 make it challenging, especially when considering each CXR
scan typically only generates one single image. Data scarcity is another issue
since collecting large-scale medical CXR data set could be difficult at
present. Therefore, how to extract more informative and relevant features from
the limited samples available becomes essential. To address these issues,
unlike traditional methods processing each CXR image from a single view, this
paper proposes triple-view convolutional neural networks for COVID-19 diagnosis
with CXR images. Specifically, the proposed networks extract individual
features from three views of each CXR image, i.e., the left lung view, the
right lung view and the overall view, in three streams and then integrate them
for joint diagnosis. The proposed network structure respects the anatomical
structure of human lungs and is well aligned with clinical diagnosis of
COVID-19 in practice. In addition, the labeling of the views does not require
experts' domain knowledge, which is needed by many existing methods. The
experimental results show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art

gradually-typed languages. Languages developed using AGT automatically satisfy
the formal semantic criteria for gradual languages identified by Siek et al.
[2015]. Nonetheless, vanilla AGT semantics can still have important
shortcomings. First, a gradual language's runtime checks should preserve the
space-efficiency guarantees inherent to the underlying static and dynamic
languages. To the contrary, the default operational semantics of AGT break
proper tail calls. Second, a gradual language's runtime checks should enforce
basic modular type-based invariants expected from the static type discipline.
To the contrary, the default operational semantics of AGT may fail to enforce
some invariants in surprising ways. We demonstrate this in the
$\text{GTFL}_\lesssim$ language of Garcia et al. [2016].
  This paper addresses both problems at once by refining the theory underlying
AGT's dynamic checks. Garcia et al. [2016] observe that AGT involves two
abstractions of static types: one for the static semantics and one for the
dynamic semantics. We recast the latter as an abstract interpretation of
subtyping itself, while gradual types still abstract static types. Then we show
how forward-completeness [Giacobazzi and Quintarelli 2001] is key to supporting
both space-efficient execution and reliable runtime type enforcement.

neighborhood implies that the Galactic disk has been remarkably affected by a
dwarf galaxy passing through it some hundreds of millions of years ago. Using
429,500 LAMOST K giants stars, we show that the spiral feature exits not only
in the solar vicinity; it also extends to about 15 kpc from the Galactic
center, and then disappears beyond this radius. Moreover, we find that when the
spiral features in a plot of $V_\phi$ as a function of position in the $Z-V_Z$
plane, at various Galactocentric radii, are re-mapped to $R-Z$ plane, the
spiral can explain well the observed asymmetric velocity substructures. This is
evidence that the phase spiral features are the same as the bulk motions found
in previous as well as this work. Test-particle simulations and N-body
simulations show that an encounter with a dwarf galaxy a few hundred million
years ago will induce a perturbation in the Galactic disk. In addition, we find
that the last impact of Sgr dSph can also contribute to the flare. As a
consequence of the encounter, the distribution function of disk stars at a
large range of radii is imprinted by the gravitational perturbation.

bilaterally for quantum goods they produced. We clarify the conditions where
certain quantum goods emerge endogenously as media of exchange, called quantum

aspects of quantum games that cannot be explained by conventional classical
games. In some situations a quantum player can acquire a quantum good from

quantum strategies that improve their welfare based on an agreement. Those

trade-off between performance and latency, and can train multiple systems with
different delays to match the performance and latency requirements of various
application scenarios. In this work, in contrast to trading-off between
performance and latency, we envisage a single system that can match the needs

model is able to refresh the final recognition result for better performance.
We have evaluated our approach on the public AISHELL-2 benchmark and an
industrial-level 20,000-hour Mandarin speech recognition task. The experimental

present idealized simulations of the atmosphere of lava planet K2-141b and
calculate the return flow of material via circulation in the magma ocean. We
then compare how pure Na, SiO, or SiO$_2$ atmospheres would impact future
observations. The more volatile Na atmosphere is thickest followed by SiO and
SiO$_2$, as expected. Despite its low vapour pressure, we find that a SiO$_2$
atmosphere is easier to observe via transit spectroscopy due to its greater
scale height near the day-night terminator and the planetary radial velocity
and acceleration are very high, facilitating high dispersion spectroscopy. The
special geometry that arises from very small orbits allows for a wide range of
limb observations for K2-141b. After determining the magma ocean depth, we
infer that the ocean circulation required for SiO steady-state flow is only
$10^{-4}$ m/s while the equivalent return flow for Na is several orders of

sustained and that the surface will evolve over time.

After controlling for a range of factors, the results provide evidence of a
small but significant negative impact of high-speed broadband on new business
creation over the study period which we suggest could be due to two factors.
Firstly, moving from basic to high-speed broadband provides few benefits to
enable new businesses being formed. Secondly, strong price competition and
market consolidation from online service providers (e.g. Amazon etc.) may be
deterring new business start-ups. This analysis provides another piece of
evidence to suggest that the economic impact of broadband is more nuanced than

Research considering both battery degradation and energy consumption in

a Q-learning-based strategy to minimize battery degradation and energy
consumption. Besides Q-learning, two heuristic energy management methods are
also proposed and optimized using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. A
vehicle propulsion system model is first presented, where the severity factor
battery degradation model is considered and experimentally validated with the
help of Genetic Algorithm. In the results analysis, Q-learning is first
explained with the optimal policy map after learning. Then, the result from a
vehicle without ultracapacitor is used as the baseline, which is compared with
the results from the vehicle with ultracapacitor using Q-learning, and two
heuristic methods as the energy management strategies. At the learning and
validation driving cycles, the results indicate that the Q-learning strategy
slows down the battery degradation by 13-20% and increases the vehicle range by
1.5-2% compared with the baseline vehicle without ultracapacitor.

abundant spectral information and plays a more important role in geological
survey, vegetation analysis and military reconnaissance. Different from normal
change detection, hyperspectral anomaly change detection (HACD) helps to find
those small but important anomaly changes between multi-temporal hyperspectral
images (HSI). In previous works, most classical methods use linear regression
to establish the mapping relationship between two HSIs and then detect the
anomalies from the residual image. However, the real spectral differences
between multi-temporal HSIs are likely to be quite complex and of nonlinearity,
leading to the limited performance of these linear predictors. In this paper,
we propose an original HACD algorithm based on auto-encoder (ACDA) to give a
nonlinear solution. The proposed ACDA can construct an effective predictor
model when facing complex imaging conditions. In the ACDA model, two systematic
auto-encoder (AE) networks are deployed to construct two predictors from two
directions. The predictor is used to model the spectral variation of the
background to obtain the predicted image under another imaging condition. Then
mean square error (MSE) between the predictive image and corresponding expected
image is computed to obtain the loss map, where the spectral differences of the
unchanged pixels are highly suppressed and anomaly changes are highlighted.
Ultimately, we take the minimum of the two loss maps of two directions as the
final anomaly change intensity map. The experiments results on public

opacity in partially-observed discrete-event systems. We consider the presence
of a passive intruder (eavesdropper) that knows the dynamic model of the system
and can use the generated information-flow to infer some ""secret"" of the
system. A system is said to be opaque if it always holds the plausible
deniability for its secret. Existing notions of opacity only consider secret
either as currently visiting some secret states or as having visited some
secret states in the past. In this paper, we investigate information-flow
security from a new angle by considering the secret of the system as the
intention to execute some particular behavior of importance in the future. To
this end, we propose a new class of opacity called pre-opacity that
characterizes whether or not the intruder can predict the visit of secret
states a certain number of steps ahead before the system actually does so.
Depending the prediction task of the intruder, we propose two specific kinds of
pre-opacity called K-step instant pre-opacity and K-step trajectory pre-opacity
to specify this concept. For each notion of pre-opacity, we provide a necessary
and sufficient condition as well as an effective verification algorithm. The
complexity for the verification of pre-opacity is exponential in the size of
the system as we show that pre-opacity is inherently PSPACE-hard. Finally, we
generalize our setting to the case where the secret intention of the system is
modeled as executing a particular sequence of events rather than visiting a
secret state.

on their online activities and interests, a task which is referred as a node
classification task. Such a task can be solved effectively using Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCNs). However, a small number of users, so-called
perturbators, may perform random activities on an OSN, which significantly
deteriorate the performance of a GCN-based node classification task. Existing
works in this direction defend GCNs either by adversarial training or by
identifying the attacker nodes followed by their removal. However, both of
these approaches require that the attack patterns or attacker nodes be
identified first, which is difficult in the scenario when the number of
perturbator nodes is very small. In this work, we develop a GCN defense model,
namely GraphLT, which uses the concept of label transition. GraphLT assumes
that perturbators' random activities deteriorate GCN's performance. To overcome
this issue, GraphLT subsequently uses a novel Bayesian label transition model,
which takes GCN's predicted labels and applies label transitions by
Gibbs-sampling-based inference and thus repairs GCN's prediction to achieve
better node classification. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets
show that GraphLT considerably enhances the performance of the node classifier
in an unperturbed environment; furthermore, it validates that GraphLT can
successfully repair a GCN-based node classifier with superior performance than
several competing methods.

highlighting the importance of phase in SE. There was an attempt to estimate
the complex ratio mask taking phase into account using complex-valued

The proposed RCLSTM is designed to process the complex-valued sequences using
complex arithmetic, and hence it preserves the dependencies between the real

evaluated on the noisy speech mixtures formed from the Voice-Bank corpus and

Comparative judgement models, such as the Bradley--Terry model, offer a
promising solution. Leveraging local knowledge, elicited via comparisons of
different areas' affluence, such models can both simplify logistics and
circumvent biases inherent to house-hold surveys. Yet widespread adoption
remains limited, due to the large amount of data existing approaches still

  (ICLR) 2021",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Selective classification, in which models can abstain on uncertain
predictions, is a natural approach to improving accuracy in settings where
errors are costly but abstentions are manageable. In this paper, we find that
while selective classification can improve average accuracies, it can
simultaneously magnify existing accuracy disparities between various groups
within a population, especially in the presence of spurious correlations. We
observe this behavior consistently across five vision and NLP datasets.
Surprisingly, increasing abstentions can even decrease accuracies on some
groups. To better understand this phenomenon, we study the margin distribution,
which captures the model's confidences over all predictions. For symmetric
margin distributions, we prove that whether selective classification
monotonically improves or worsens accuracy is fully determined by the accuracy
at full coverage (i.e., without any abstentions) and whether the distribution
satisfies a property we call left-log-concavity. Our analysis also shows that
selective classification tends to magnify full-coverage accuracy disparities.
Motivated by our analysis, we train distributionally-robust models that achieve
similar full-coverage accuracies across groups and show that selective
classification uniformly improves each group on these models. Altogether, our
results suggest that selective classification should be used with care and
underscore the importance of training models to perform equally well across
groups at full coverage.

analytical calculation performed in the regular solution approximation with a

are selectively textured on the glass surface in order to mimic the spatial
randomness, pillar-like morphology, as well as the remarkable anti-reflection
properties found on the wings of the glasswing butterfly, Greta oto[1] and
various Cicada species[2]. The artificial structures exhibit impressive
anti-reflective properties, both in the visible and infrared frequency range.
Accordingly, the laser-processed glass surfaces show reflectivity smaller than
1% for various angles of incidence in the visible spectrum for S-P linearly
polarized configurations. While, in the near infrared spectrum, the
laser-textured glass shows higher transmittance compared to the pristine. It is
envisaged that our current results will revolutionize the technology of
anti-reflective transparent surfaces and impact numerous applications from
glass displays to optoelectronic devices.

hardware has to be synchronized to a common reference clock with minimal skew
and low jitter. Today's mainstream solutions to precise clock distribution and
deterministic latency messaging rely on the capabilities of high speed serial
transceivers (a.k.a. SerDes) embedded in modern Field Programmable Gate Arrays

potentially reach higher synchronization accuracy, at significant hardware
expenses. This work reports some first steps to explore a third scheme for
clock and synchronous message distribution. Like the standard approach, the
same media is used to convey clock and data, but instead of using today's
""data-centric"" links where the recovered clock is only a by-product of a
SerDes, this paper defines and investigates ""clock-centric"" links where, at the
opposite, a clock is carried by the link, and synchronous data are embedded
into it by a modulation technique. After defining the concepts and principles
of data-centric links, experimental studies are presented. Finally, the merits
and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed.

Lovelock-Lanczos gravity (LLG) in four dimensions, in which dimensional poles
and possibly counter-terms are introduced to compensate the vanishing of the
Lovelock field equations in critical and lower dimensions. In this paper, we
review and extend some of these results. We first find a class of LLG theories
whose perturbative expansion around a given (A)dS vacuum can be regularized up
to arbitrary order, the simplest one being close to Lovelock gravities with a
unique vacuum. If well-defined, these models might be interpreted as effective
field theories of gravitons in four dimensions, or might be combined with other
regularization approaches. Among those, we establish the general procedure to
obtain $4$D covariant and background independent regularizations from metric
transformations. In the conformal (and critical) case, we generalize previous
results obtained for the Gauss-Bonnet theory to the full Lovelock series.
Similarly, the regularization of Gauss-Bonnet gravity from the breaking of
$4$D-covariance down to $3$D is generalized to arbitrary curvature order,
seemingly resulting in new Minimally Modified gravities propagating solely the
two degrees of freedom of the graviton. Finally, we present general results
regarding the minisuperspace regularization of specific sectors of LLG.
Non-perturbative (in curvature) regularized theories admitting non-singular
black holes as well as non-singular past-dS$_4$ and cyclic closed cosmologies
are found. We conclude with the non-uniqueness of these background
regularizations by finding inequivalent regularizations of the Bianchi I sector

scientific and engineering applications. In many cases the solution of linear

bottleneck in the further development of scientific and technical software. For
large scale simulations, nowadays accounting for several millions or even
billions of unknowns, it is quite common to resort to preconditioned iterative
solvers for exploiting their low memory requirements and, at least potential,
parallelism. Approximate inverses have been shown to be robust and effective
preconditioners in various contexts. In this work, we show how adaptive FSAI,
an approximate inverse characterized by a very high degree of parallelism, can
be successfully implemented on a distributed memory computer equipped with GPU
accelerators. Taking advantage of GPUs in adaptive FSAI set-up is not a trivial
task, nevertheless we show through an extensive numerical experimentation how
the proposed approach outperforms more traditional preconditioners and results
in a close-to-ideal behaviour in challenging linear algebra problems.

and matrices. When we compress a vector from size $N$ down to size $n \ll N$,
it certainly makes it easier to store and transmit efficiently, but does it
also make it easier to process?
  In this paper we consider lossless compression schemes, and ask if we can run
our computations on the compressed data as efficiently as if the original data
was that small. That is, if an operation has time complexity
$T(\rm{inputsize})$, can we perform it on the compressed representation in time
$T(n)$ rather than $T(N)$? We consider the most basic linear algebra
operations: inner product, matrix-vector multiplication, and matrix
multiplication. In particular, given two compressed vectors, can we compute
their inner product in time $O(n)$? Or perhaps we must decompress first and
then multiply, spending $\Omega(N)$ time?
  The answer depends on the compression scheme. While for simple ones such as
Run-Length-Encoding (RLE) the inner product can be done in $O(n)$ time, we
prove that this is impossible for compressions from a richer class: essentially
$n^2$ or even larger runtimes are needed in the worst case (under complexity
assumptions). This is the class of grammar-compressions containing most popular
methods such as the Lempel-Ziv family. These schemes are more compressing than
the simple RLE, but alas, we prove that performing computations on them is much
harder.

classification performance of spatially non-uniform naturalistic textures. We
encoded the spatio-temporal activation patterns of mechanoreceptors through

improved texture classification in comparison to use of individual

robust to changes in sliding velocity. The importance of exploiting precise
spatial and temporal correlations between sensory channels is evident from the
fact that on either removal of precise temporal information or altering of
spatial structure of response pattern, a significant performance drop was
observed. This study thus demonstrates the superiority of population coding
approaches that can exploit the precise spatio-temporal information encoded in
activation patterns of mechanoreceptor populations. It, therefore, makes an

reduced displacement estimation error for noisy as well as for noise-free image

true for large particle image diameters when particle images are intersected at

$B_0$, at the poles ranging from $\sim 7 \times 10^9$ G to $\sim 6 \times
10^{11}$ G which fill the gap between the $B_0$ ranges of central compact

10^5$ yr, much smaller than their characteristic ages, such that, cooling
luminosities of a large fraction of relatively nearby RRATs could be detected

the pulsar death valley with the fields inferred from the dipole-torque
formula, while they do not show strong, continuous radio pulses. The $B_0$

be ignited by the disc-field interaction occasionally enhancing the flux of
open field lines through the magnetic poles. We have also discussed the

extracting new asset-specific trading rules from vast historical data to
increase total return and decrease the risk of portfolios is difficult for
human experts. Recently, various deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods are
employed to learn the new trading rules for each asset. In this paper, a novel
DRL model with various feature extraction modules is proposed. The effect of
different input representations on the performance of the models is
investigated and the performance of DRL-based models in different markets and
asset situations is studied. The proposed model in this work outperformed the
other state-of-the-art models in learning single asset-specific trading rules
and obtained a total return of almost 262% in two years on a specific asset
while the best state-of-the-art model get 78% on the same asset in the same
time period.

these challenges by formalizing the notion of global thermometry leading to the

Intelligent Transportation Systems. For accurate and precise time
synchronization in vehicular networks, Global Navigation Satellite System
(GNSS) is getting increasing attention for effective use of its time
dissemination to vehicular networks. In urban road scenarios, the blockage of
satellite signals affects precise positing due to erroneous geometry. However,
for timing, it creates less deflection as long as a single satellite is
visible. With the recent development of Multi-GNSS receivers, signal reception
no longer relies on a single GNSS constellation but all the existing four GNSS
systems. This increases the number of visible satellites in the sky, thus
increasing the coverage of satellite signals. Developing a method of GNSS time
synchronization, we have conducted a systematic field-based study in this paper
to determine the attainable timing accuracy in vehicular networks using
commercial-grade GNSS receivers and off-the-shelf communication devices. Our
experimental results show that the attainable timing accuracy from GNSS
services in consumer-grade on-board devices can be as good as 2 microseconds. A
momentary outage of GNSS time solution due to signal blockage on the road can
lead a clock error of up to sub-microseconds, which still meets the desired

theorists lie in the structure of their rational group algebras due to varied
applications. The purpose of this paper is to bind the two threads together.
Revisiting Dade's celebrated embedding theorem which states that a finite
solvable group can be embedded inside some monomial group, it is proved here
that the embedding is indeed done inside some generalized strongly monomial
group. The so called generalized strongly monomial groups arose in a recent
work of authors while understanding the algebraic structure of rational group
algebras. Still unresolved monomiality questions have been correlated by
proving that all the classes of monomial groups where they have been answered
are generalized strongly monomial. The study also raises some intriguing
questions weaker than those asked by Dornhoff and Isaacs in their
investigations.

the presence of two phases of a highly ionized, high column density accretion
disk wind outflowing with $v_{out1}\sim -0.1c$ and $v_{out2}\sim -0.2c$. Here
we present two new observations of MCG-03-58-007: one was carried out in 2016
with Chandra and one in 2018 with Swift. Both caught MCG-03-58-007 in a
brighter state ($F_{\mathrm{2-10\,keV}}\sim 4\times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$) confirming the presence of the fast disk wind. The multi-epoch
observations of MCG-03-58-007 covering the period from 2010 to 2018 were then
analysed. These data show that the lower velocity component outflowing with
$v_{out1}\sim -0.072\pm 0.002c$ is persistent and detected in all the
observations, although it is variable in column density in the range
$N_\rm{H}\sim 3-8 \times 10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$. In the 2016 Swift observation we
detected again the second faster component outflowing with $v_{out2}\sim
-0.2c$, with a column density ($N_\rm{H}=7.0^{+5.6}_{-4.1}\times
10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$), similar to that seen during the Suzaku observation. However
during the Chandra observation two years earlier, this zone was not present
($N_\rm{H}<1.5\times 10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$), suggesting that this faster zone is
intermittent. Overall the multi-epochs observations show that the disk wind in
MCG-03-58-007 is not only powerful, but also extremely variable, hence placing
MCG-03-58-007 among unique disk winds such as the one seen in the famous QSO
PDS456. One of the main results of this investigation is the consideration that
these winds could be extremely variable, sometime appearing and sometime
disappearing; thus to reach solid and firm conclusions about their energetics
multiple observations are mandatory.

for respiratory motion. However, RSN has been limited to a 1D rigid correction
which is often insufficient for patients with complex respiratory patterns. The
goal of this work is therefore to improve the robustness and quality of 3D
radial CMRA by incorporating both 3D motion information and nonrigid
intra-acquisition correction of the data into a framework called focused
navigation (fNAV). Methods: We applied fNAV to 500 data sets from a numerical
simulation, 22 healthy volunteers, and 549 cardiac patients. We compared fNAV
to RSN and respiratory resolved XD-GRASP reconstructions of the same data and
recorded reconstruction times. Motion accuracy was measured as the correlation
between fNAV and ground truth for simulations, and fNAV and image registration
for in vivo data. Vessel sharpness was measured using Soap-Bubble. Finally,
image quality analysis was performed by a blinded expert reviewer who chose the
best image for each data set. Results The reconstruction time for fNAV images
was significantly higher than RSN (6.1 +/- 2.1 minutes vs 1.4 +/- 0.3, minutes,
p<0.025) but significantly lower than XD-GRASP (25.6 +/- 7.1, minutes,
p<0.025). There is high correlation between the fNAV, and reference
displacement estimates across all data sets (0.73 +/- 0.29). For all data, fNAV
lead to significantly sharper vessels than all other reconstructions (p <
0.01). Finally, a blinded reviewer chose fNAV as the best image in 239 out of
571 cases (p = 10-5). Conclusion: fNAV is a promising technique for improving
free-breathing 3D radial whole-heart CMRA. This novel approach to respiratory
self-navigation can derive 3D nonrigid motion estimations from an acquired 1D
signal yielding statistically significant improvement in image sharpness
relative to 1D translational correction as well as XD-GRASP reconstructions.

the partitioning coefficients and saturation vapour pressures of 3414
atmospheric oxidation products from the master chemical mechanism using the

coefficients: between a water-insoluble organic matter phase and the gas phase
($K_{WIOM/G}$), and between an infinitely dilute solution with pure water and
the gas phase ($K_{W/G}$). For the input representation of the atomic structure
of each organic molecule to the machine, we test different descriptors. Our
best ML model predicts $P_{sat}$ and $K_{WIOM/G}$ to within 0.3 and $K_{W/G}$
to within 0.4 logarithmic units of the original COSMOtherm calculations. This
is equal or better than the typical accuracy of COSMOtherm predictions compared

balance public health and economy. Mobility plays a central role in this
dilemma because the movement of people enables both economic activity and virus
spread. We use mobility data in the form of counts of travelers between
regions, to extend the often-used SEIR models to include mobility between
regions. We quantify the trade-off between mobility and infection spread in
terms of a single parameter, to be chosen by policy makers, and propose
strategies for restricting mobility so that the restrictions are minimal while
the infection spread is effectively limited. We consider restrictions where the
country is divided into regions, and study scenarios where mobility is allowed
within these regions, and disallowed between them. We propose heuristic methods
to approximate optimal choices for these regions. We evaluate the obtained
restrictions based on our trade-off. The results show that our methods are
especially effective when the infections are highly concentrated, e.g., around
a few municipalities, as resulting from superspreading events that play an
important role in the spread of COVID-19. We demonstrate our method in the
example of the Netherlands. The results apply more broadly when mobility data

ongoing accretion of solids. It has been customary to assume that all solids
end up at the center constituting a ""core"" of refractory materials, whereas the
envelope remains metal-free. Recent work, as well as observations by the JUNO
mission, indicate however that the distinction may not be so clear cut. Indeed,
small silicate, pebble-sized particles will sublimate in the atmosphere when
they hit the sublimation temperature (T ~ 2,000 K). In this paper we extend
previous analytical work to compute the properties of planets under such a
pebble accretion scenario. We conduct 1D numerical calculations of the
atmosphere of an accreting planet, solving the stellar structure equations,
augmented by a non-ideal equation of state that describes a
hydrogen/helium-silicate vapor mixture. Calculations terminate at the point
where the total mass in metal equals that of the H/He gas, which we numerically
confirm as the onset of runaway gas accretion. When pebbles sublimate before
reaching the core, insufficient (accretion) energy is available to mix dense,
vapor-rich lower layers with the higher layers of lower metallicity. A gradual
structure in which Z decreases with radius is therefore a natural outcome of
planet formation by pebble accretion. We highlight, furthermore, that (small)
pebbles can act as the dominant source of opacity, preventing rapid cooling and
presenting a channel for (mini-)Neptunes to survive in gas-rich disks.
Nevertheless, once pebble accretion subsides, the atmosphere rapidly clears
followed by runaway gas accretion. We consider atmospheric recycling to be the
more probable mechanisms that have stalled the growth of these planets'
envelopes.

evolve in such a way that the temperatures cross each other during the
relaxation towards equilibrium. In this paper we show the emergence of a
Mpemba-like effect in a molecular binary mixture in contact with a thermal
reservoir (bath). The interaction between the gaseous particles of the mixture
and the thermal reservoir is modeled via a viscous drag force plus a stochastic
Langevin-like term. The presence of the external bath couples the time
evolution of the total and partial temperatures of each component allowing the
appearance of the Mpemba phenomenon, even when the initial temperature
differences are of the same order of the temperatures themselves. Analytical
results are obtained by considering multitemperature Maxwellian approximations
for the velocity distribution functions of each component. The theoretical
analysis is carried out for initial states close to and far away (large
Mpemba-like effect) from equilibrium. The former situation allows us to develop
a simple theory where the time evolution equation for the temperature is
linearized around its asymptotic equilibrium solution. This linear theory
provides an expression for the crossover time. We also provide a qualitative
description of the large Mpemba effect. Our theoretical results agree very well
with computer simulations obtained by numerically solving the Enskog kinetic
equation by means of the direct simulation Monte Carlo method and by performing
molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, preliminary results for driven

to the main memory requirements. Recently introduced streaming Randomized SVD
schemes work under the restrictive assumption that the singular value spectrum
of the data has exponential decay. This is seldom true for any practical data.
Although these methods are claimed to be applicable to scientific computations
due to associated tail-energy error bounds, the approximation errors in the
singular vectors and values are high when the aforementioned assumption does
not hold. Furthermore from a practical perspective, oversampling can still be
memory intensive or worse can exceed the feature dimension of the data. To
address these issues, we present Range-Net as an alternative to randomized SVD
that satisfies the tail-energy lower bound given by Eckart-Young-Mirsky (EYM)
theorem. Range-Net is a deterministic two-stage neural optimization approach
with random initialization, where the main memory requirement depends
explicitly on the feature dimension and desired rank, independent of the sample
dimension. The data samples are read in a streaming setting with the network
minimization problem converging to the desired rank-r approximation. Range-Net
is fully interpretable where all the network outputs and weights have a
specific meaning. We provide theoretical guarantees that Range-Net extracted
SVD factors satisfy EYM tail-energy lower bound at machine precision. Our
numerical experiments on real data at various scales confirms this bound. A
comparison against the state of the art streaming Randomized SVD shows that
Range-Net accuracy is better by six orders of magnitude while being memory
efficient.

of space-dependent diffusion in presence of a constant bias. In our
analytically tractable model system, a particle diffusing in a linear potential
$U(x)\propto\mu |x|$ with a spatially varying diffusion coefficient
$D(x)=D_0|x|$ undergoes stochastic resetting, i.e., returns to its initial
position $x_0$ at random intervals of time, with a constant rate $r$.
Considering an absorbing boundary placed at $x_a<x_0$, we first derive an exact
expression of the survival probability of the diffusing particle in the Laplace
space and then explore its first-passage to the origin as a limiting case of
that general result. In the limit $x_a\to0$, we derive an exact analytic
expression for the first-passage time distribution of the underlying process.
Once resetting is introduced, the system is observed to exhibit a series of
dynamical transitions in terms of a sole parameter, $\nu=(1+\mu D_0^{-1})$,
that captures the interplay of the drift and the diffusion. Constructing a full
phase diagram in terms of $\nu$, we show that for $\nu<0$, i.e., when the
potential is strongly repulsive, the particle can never reach the origin. In
contrast, for weakly repulsive or attractive potential ($\nu>0$), it eventually
reaches the origin. Resetting accelerates such first-passage when $\nu<3$, but
hinders its completion for $\nu>3$. A resetting transition is therefore
observed at $\nu=3$, and we provide a comprehensive analysis of the same. The
present study paves the way for an array of theoretical and experimental works
that combine stochastic resetting with inhomogeneous diffusion in a
conservative force-field.

contamination on optical surfaces that accounts for ~114 mmag of variation.
Correcting for PWV based on a suite of stellar spectra and detailed PWV
absorption models accounts for another 47 mmag of zero-point variation. The
MzLS per-image sensitivity is decreased by ~40 mmag per effective mm of PWV.
The difference between blue (r-z < 0.5 mag) and red (1.2 mag < r-z) stars
increases by 3.25 mmag per effective mm of PWV.
  These results show the need for high-precision photometric surveys to
simultaneously monitor PWV. We find that this GPS system provides more precise
PWV measurements than using differential measurements of stars of different
colors and recommend that observatories install dual-band GPS as a
low-maintenance, relatively low cost, auxiliary calibration system. We extend
our results of the need for well-calibrated PWV measurements by presenting
calculations of the PWV photometric impact on three science cases of interest:
stellar photometry, supernova cosmology, and quasar identification and
variability.

problems using a suitable quantum many body Hamiltonian encoding the solution
in its ground state. To find the solution one typically evolves the ground
state of a soluble initial Hamiltonian adiabatically to the ground state of the
designated final Hamiltonian. Here we explore whether and when a full quantum
representation of the dynamics leads to higher probability to end up in the
desired ground when compared to a classical mean field approximation. As
simple, nontrivial example we target the ground state of interacting bosons
trapped in a tight binding lattice with small local defect by turning on long
range interactions. Already two atoms in four sites interacting via two cavity
modes prove complex enough to exhibit significant differences between the full
quantum model and a mean field approximation for the cavity fields mediating
the interactions. We find a large parameter region of highly successful quantum
annealing where the semi-classical approach largely fails. Here we see strong
evidence for the importance of entanglement to end close to the optimal
solution. The quantum model also reduces the minimal time for a high target
occupation probability. In contrast to naive expectations that enlarging the
Hilbert space is beneficial, different numerical cut-offs of the Hilbert space
reveal an improved performance for lower cut-offs, i.e. an nonphysical reduced
Hilbert space, for short simulation times. Hence a less faithful representation
of the full quantum dynamics sometimes creates a higher numerical success
probability in shorter time. However, a sufficiently high cut-off proves
relevant to obtain near perfect fidelity for long simulations times in a single
run. Overall our results exhibit a clear improvement based on a quantum model
versus simulations based on a classical field approximation.

as a deep multi-layer neural network; in both cases, one alternates linear
steps and pointwise nonlinearities. We exploit this connection by
parameterizing the SSM and viewing the linear steps as general linear
functions, similar to the weight matrices in a neural network. The resulting
physics-based machine-learning model has several advantages over ""black-box""
function approximators. For example, it allows us to examine and interpret the
learned solutions in order to understand why they perform well. As an
application, low-complexity nonlinear equalization is considered, where the
task is to efficiently invert the NLSE. This is commonly referred to as digital
backpropagation (DBP). Rather than employing neural networks, the proposed
algorithm, dubbed learned DBP (LDBP), uses the physics-based model with
trainable filters in each step and its complexity is reduced by progressively
pruning filter taps during gradient descent. Our main finding is that the
filters can be pruned to remarkably short lengths-as few as 3 taps/step-without
sacrificing performance. As a result, the complexity can be reduced by orders
of magnitude in comparison to prior work. By inspecting the filter responses,
an additional theoretical justification for the learned parameter
configurations is provided. Our work illustrates that combining data-driven

  Estimation of Noise Eigenvalues Using Relatively Few Samples","15 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimating the number of signals embedded in noise is a fundamental problem
in array signal processing. The classic RMT estimator based on random matrix
theory (RMT) tends to under-estimate the number of signals as it does not
consider the non-negligible bias term among eigenvalues for finite sample size.
Moreover, the RMT estimator suffers from uncertainty in noise variance
estimation problem. In order to overcome these problems, we firstly derive a
more accurate expression for the distribution of the sample eigenvalues and the
bias term among eigenvalues by utilizing the linear shrinkage (LS) estimate of
noise sample eigenvalues. Then, we analyze the effect of the bias term among
eigenvalues on the estimation performance of the RMT estimator, and derive the
increased under-estimation probability of the RMT estimator incurred by this
bias term. Based on these results, we propose a novel RMT estimator based on LS
estimate of noise eigenvalues (termed as LS-RMT estimator) by incorporating the
bias term into the decision criterion of the RMT estimator. As the LS-RMT
estimator incorporates this bias term among eigenvalues into the decision
criterion of the RMT estimator, it can detect signal eigenvalues immersed in
this bias term. Therefore, the LS-RMT estimator can overcome the higher
under-estimation probability of the RMT estimator incurred by the bias term
among eigenvalues, and also avoids the uncertainty in the noise variance
estimation suffered by the RMT estimator as the noise variance is estimated
under the assumption that the eigenvalue being tested is arising from noise.
Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to show that the proposed
LS-RMT estimator outperforms the existing estimators.

recognition system and is still challenging in real applications, such as
on-road scenarios. In particular, small-sized and oblique license plates,
mainly caused by the distant and mobile camera, are difficult to detect. In
this work, we propose a novel and applicable method for degraded license plate
detection via vehicle-plate relation mining, which localizes the license plate
in a coarse-to-fine scheme. First, we propose to estimate the local region
around the license plate by using the relationships between the vehicle and the
license plate, which can greatly reduce the search area and precisely detect
very small-sized license plates. Second, we propose to predict the
quadrilateral bounding box in the local region by regressing the four corners
of the license plate to robustly detect oblique license plates. Moreover, the
whole network can be trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments
verify the effectiveness of our proposed method for small-sized and oblique
license plates. Codes are available at

identity in speaker recognition tasks. The embedding space should ideally
capture the variations between all possible speakers, encoding the multiple
acoustic aspects that make up a speaker's identity, whilst being robust to
non-speaker acoustic variation. Deep speaker embeddings are normally trained
discriminatively, predicting speaker identity labels on the training data. We
hypothesise that additionally predicting speaker-related auxiliary variables --
such as age and nationality -- may yield representations that are better able
to generalise to unseen speakers. We propose a framework for making use of
auxiliary label information, even when it is only available for speech corpora
mismatched to the target application. On a test set of US Supreme Court
recordings, we show that by leveraging two additional forms of speaker
attribute information derived respectively from the matched training data, and
VoxCeleb corpus, we improve the performance of our deep speaker embeddings for
both verification and diarization tasks, achieving a relative improvement of
26.2% in DER and 6.7% in EER compared to baselines using speaker labels only.
This improvement is obtained despite the auxiliary labels having been scraped

LiDAR point onto the RGB image plane based on our reliable calibrated and
synchronized sensors, we adopt a parameter self-adaptive framework to produce
2D dense depth map. For image stitching, optimal seamline for the overlapping
area is searched using a graph-cuts-based method to alleviate the geometric
influence and image blending based on the pyramid multi-band is utilized to
eliminate the photometric effects near the stitching line. Since each pixel is
associated with a depth value, we design this depth value as a radius in the
spherical projection which can further project the panoramic image to the world

  Knowledge Distillation","Accepted as long paper in COLING 2020",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cross-lingual Machine Reading Comprehension (CLMRC) remains a challenging
problem due to the lack of large-scale annotated datasets in low-source
languages, such as Arabic, Hindi, and Vietnamese. Many previous approaches use
translation data by translating from a rich-source language, such as English,
to low-source languages as auxiliary supervision. However, how to effectively
leverage translation data and reduce the impact of noise introduced by
translation remains onerous. In this paper, we tackle this challenge and
enhance the cross-lingual transferring performance by a novel augmentation
approach named Language Branch Machine Reading Comprehension (LBMRC). A
language branch is a group of passages in one single language paired with
questions in all target languages. We train multiple machine reading
comprehension (MRC) models proficient in individual language based on LBMRC.
Then, we devise a multilingual distillation approach to amalgamate knowledge
from multiple language branch models to a single model for all target
languages. Combining the LBMRC and multilingual distillation can be more robust
to the data noises, therefore, improving the model's cross-lingual ability.
Meanwhile, the produced single multilingual model is applicable to all target
languages, which saves the cost of training, inference, and maintenance for
multiple models. Extensive experiments on two CLMRC benchmarks clearly show the
effectiveness of our proposed method.

Coplanar Waveguide Resonator (CPW) and a Split-Ring Resonator (SRR). Both
sensors possessed sensing electrodes with a narrow gap to detect single cells
passing through a microfluidic channel integrated on the same chip. We also
show that standalone microwave sensors can track the relative changes in

such behavior patterns can be captured using probabilistic trajectory models

schemes, e.g.\ to facilitate multi-task and transfer learning. We then extend
these ideas to latent variable models and consider a formulation to learn
hierarchical priors that capture different aspects of the behavior in reusable

understanding of lunar geological history, but they have been controversial.
The widely accepted, post-Apollo paradigm of early lunar impact cratering (ca.
1975-2014) proposed very low or negligible impact cratering in the period from
accretion (>4.4 Ga) to about 4.0 Ga ago, followed by a 170-million-year-long
spike of cataclysmic cratering, during which most prominent multi-ring impact
basins formed at age of about 3.9 Ga. More recent dynamical models suggest very
early intense impact rates, declining throughout the period from accretion
until an age of about 3.0 Ga. These models remove the basin-forming spike. This
shift has important consequences on megaregolith evolution and properties of
rock samples that can be collected on the lunar surface today. We adopt the
Morbidelli et al. (2018) ""accretion tail"" model of early intense bombardment,
declining as a function of time. We find effects differing from the previous
models: early crater saturation and supersaturation; disturbance of magma ocean
solidification; deep early megaregolith; and erosive destruction of the
earliest multi-ring basins, their impact melts, and their ejecta blankets. Our
results explain observations such as differences in numbers of early lunar
impact melts vs. numbers of early igneous crustal rocks, highland breccias
containing impact melts as old as 4.35 Ga, absence of a 170 Myr-long spike in
impact melt ages at 3.9 Ga among lunar and asteroidal meteorites, and GRAIL

Particularly, we show which regions of the parameter space are ruled out due to
the different dark matter constraints and the corresponding model-specific
parameters: $\lambda, \kappa, A_{\lambda}$, and $A_{\kappa}$. We analyze all
annihilation and co-annihilation processes (with heavier neutralinos and

$\tilde{\chi}_1^0$, are studied, and the decays of heavy neutralinos and

Higgsino with a mass range that resides mostly between 1000 and 1500 GeV.

307--351 (2021)] for the solution of linear positive Semi-Definite Programming
(SDP) problems, allowing inexactness in the solution of the associated Newton
systems. In particular, we combine an infeasible Interior Point Method (IPM)
with the Proximal Method of Multipliers (PMM) and interpret the algorithm
(IP-PMM) as a primal-dual regularized IPM, suitable for solving SDP problems.
We apply some iterations of an IPM to each sub-problem of the PMM until a
satisfactory solution is found. We then update the PMM parameters, form a new
IPM neighbourhood, and repeat this process. Given this framework, we prove
polynomial complexity of the algorithm, under mild assumptions, and without
requiring exact computations for the Newton directions. We furthermore provide
a necessary condition for lack of strong duality, which can be used as a basis
for constructing detection mechanisms for identifying pathological cases within
IP-PMM.

inflationary gravitational waves ought to mitigate the large variance
associated with the $B$-modes produced by gravitational lensing, a process
known as delensing. A popular approach to delensing entails building a lensing
$B$-mode template by mimicking the lensing operation, either at gradient order
or non-perturbatively, using high-resolution $E$-mode observations and some
proxy of the lensing potential. By explicitly calculating all contributions to
two-loop order in lensing to the power spectrum of $B$-modes delensed with such
a template in the noise-free limit, we are able to show that: (i) corrections
to the leading-order calculation of the lensing $B$-mode power spectrum only
enter at the $O(1)\,\%$ level because of extensive cancellations between large
terms at next-to-leading order; (ii) these cancellations would disappear if a
gradient-order template were to be built from unlensed or delensed $E$-modes,
giving rise to a residual delensing floor of $O(10)\,\%$ of the original power;
(iii) new cancellations arise when the lensed $E$-modes are used in the
gradient-order template, allowing for the delensing floor to be as low as
$O(1)\,\%$ of the original power in practical applications of this method; and
(iv) these new cancellations would disappear for a non-perturbative template
constructed from the lensed $E$-modes, reintroducing a residual delensing floor
of $O(10)\,\%$. We further show that the gradient-order template outperforms
the non-perturbative one in realistic scenarios with noisy estimates of the
$E$-mode polarization and lensing potential. We therefore recommend that in
practical applications of $B$-mode template delensing, where the template is
constructed directly from the (filtered) observed $E$-modes, the gradient-order
approach should be used rather than a non-perturbative remapping.

light-emitting diode (OLED) based on the orange light-emitting polymer (LEP)
Livilux PDO-124. The OLED serves as a compact, extended light source which is
capable of uniformly illuminating the cortical surface when placed across a
burr hole in the skull. Since all layers of the OLED are substantially
transparent to photons with energies below the optical gap of the LEP, light
emitted or reflected by the cortical surface may be efficiently transmitted
through the OLED and into the objective lens of a low magnification microscope
('macroscope'). The OLED may be placed close to the cortical surface, providing
efficient coupling of incident light into the brain cavity; furthermore, the
macroscope may be placed close to the upper surface of the OLED, enabling
efficient collection of reflected/emitted light from the cortical surface.
Hence the use of a semi-transparent OLED simplifies the optical setup, while at
the same time maintaining high sensitivity. The OLED is applied here to one of
the most demanding forms of optical brain imaging, namely extrinsic optical
imaging involving a voltage sensitive dye (VSD). Specifically, we carry out
functional imaging of the primary visual cortex (V1) of a rat, using the
voltage sensitive dye RH-1691 as a reporter. Imaging through the OLED
light-source, we are able to resolve small (~ 0.1 %) changes in the
fluorescence intensity of the dye due to changes in the neuronal membrane
potential following a visual stimulus. Results are obtained on a single trial

the light crossing argument, the coronal size is inferred to be about 30
gravitational radii for a black hole mass of $10^{9} {\rm M}_{\odot}$ and the
total flare energy exceeds $10^{51}$ erg. A hardening of the X-ray emission
accompanied the flare, with the photon index decreasing from $\Gamma=2.2$ to
$\Gamma=1.7$ and back again. The flare is produced in the X-ray corona, the
lack of any optical or UV variability being consistent with a constant
accretion rate. Simultaneous XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations were performed,
$1-3$ days after the flare peak and during the decline phase. These caught PDS
456 in a bright, bare state, where no disc wind absorption features are
apparent. The hard X-ray spectrum shows a high energy roll-over, with an
e-folding energy of $E_{\rm fold}=51^{+11}_{-8}$ keV. The deduced coronal
temperature, of $kT=13$ keV, is one of the coolest measured in any AGN and PDS
456 lies well below the predicted pair annihilation line in X-ray corona. The
spectral variability, becoming softer when fainter following the flare, is
consistent with models of cooling X-ray coronae. Alternatively, an increase in

we introduce global position priors to fix the absence of positional
information, which may result in global positional reasoning ambiguities. Both
the linguistic and visual features are concatenated to finalize the target
localization. Experimental results on the Touchdown show that our method is

forces, we characterize the largest norm of an external force that the grasping
system may support, that is, the norm of the worst-case loading that may be
applied and still be supported. A few simple examples are given for the sake of
illustration.

Venus' atmosphere (>75 km, above the cloud decks) that are discrepant with the
findings in G2020 and G2021a/b. The measurements target the fundamental first
rotational transition of PH3 (J=1-0) at 266.944513 GHz, which was observed with
the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) in June 2017 and with the Atacama
Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in March 2019. This line's center
is near the SO2 (J=309,21-318,24) transition at 266.943329 GHz (only 1.3 km/s
away from the PH3 line) which represents a potential source of contamination.
The JCMT and ALMA data, as presented in G2020, are at spectral resolutions
comparable to the frequency separation of the two lines. Moreover, the spectral
features identified are several km/s in width, and therefore do not permit
distinct spectroscopic separation of the candidate spectral lines of PH3 and
SO2. We present the radiative transfer modelling we have performed and then
discuss the ALMA and JCMT analyses in turn.

antiferromagnetic phases found in the bulk. Further, for Mn-rich conditions

which can be applied to computing thermal reaction rates for complex molecular
systems including quantum tunneling effects. There have been a number of
attempts to extend the theory to treat microcanonical rates. However, the
previous formulations are either computationally unfeasible for large systems
due to an explicit sum over states or they involve extra approximations which
make them less reliable. We propose a robust and practical microcanonical
formulation called density-of-states instanton theory, which avoids the sum
over states altogether. In line with the semiclassical approximations inherent
to the instanton approach, we employ the stationary-phase approximation to the
inverse Laplace transform to obtain the densities of states. This can be
evaluated using only post-processing of the data available from a small set of
instanton calculations, such that our approach remains computationally
efficient. We show that the new formulation predicts results that agree well
with quantum scattering theory for an atom-diatom reaction and with experiments
for a photoexcited unimolecular hydrogen transfer in a Criegee intermediate.
When the thermal rate is evaluated from a Boltzmann average over our new
microcanonical formalism, it can overcome some problems of conventional
instanton theory. In particular, it predicts a smooth transition at the
crossover temperature and is able to describe bimolecular reactions with
pre-reactive complexes such as CH3OH + OH.

a stellar rotation period of $89.8 \pm 4.0$ d. Using Zeeman-Doppler Imaging, we

magnetic field of typical strength 200 G, whose topology is mainly poloidal,
and moderately axisymmetric, featuring, in particular, a dipole component of
135 G tilted at 51$^{\circ}$ to the rotation axis. The large-scale magnetic
flux is roughly 3 times smaller than the flux measured from the Zeeman
broadening of unpolarized lines, which suggests that the underlying dynamo is
efficient at generating a magnetic field at the largest spatial scales. Our
observations occur $\sim$1 yr after the maximum of the reported 7 yr-activity
cycle of Proxima Cen, which opens the door for the first long-term study of how
the large-scale field evolves with the magnetic cycle in a fully-convective

intense UV-dominated irradiation presents a modeling challenge. Here, we
present the first fully self-consistent 1D atmosphere models that take into
account the UV irradiation's effect on the object's temperature structure. We
explore two BD-WD systems, namely WD-0137-349 and EPIC-212235321. WD-0137-349B
has an equilibrium temperature that would place it in the transition between
hot and ultra-hot Jupiters, while EPIC-212235321B has an equilibrium
temperature higher than all ultra-hot Jupiters except KELT-9b. We explore some
peculiar aspects of irradiated BD atmospheres and show that existing photometry
can be well-fit with our models. Additionally, the detections of atomic
emission lines from these BDs can be explained by a strong irradiation-induced
temperature inversion, similar to inversions recently explored in ultra-hot
Jupiters. Our models of WD-0137-349B can reproduce the observed equivalent
width of many but not all of these atomic lines. We use the observed photometry
of these objects to retrieve the temperature structure using the PHOENIX
ExoplaneT Retrieval Algorithm (PETRA) and demonstrate that the structures are
consistent with our models, albeit somewhat cooler at low pressures. We then
discuss the similarities and differences between this class of irradiated brown
dwarf and the lower-mass ultra-hot Jupiters. Lastly, we describe the behavior

the rotationally invariant case, we obtain a closed formula for $\psi(x,t)$,
the asymptotic density of the radial parts of the roots of the $[tn]$-th
derivative of $P_n$. Although its derivation is non-rigorous, we provide
numerical evidence for its correctness and prove that it solves the PDE of
O'Rourke and Steinerberger. Moreover, we present several examples in which the
solution is fully explicit (including the special case in which the initial
condition $\psi(x,0)$ is an arbitrary convex combination of delta functions)
and analyze some properties of the solutions such as the behavior of void
annuli and circles of zeroes. As an additional support for the correctness of
the method, we show that a similar method, applied to the case when $\mu_0$ is
concentrated on the real line, gives a correct result which is known to have an
interpretation in terms of free probability.

much the perturbations can source the fifth force when the static background is
well screened, and whether the resultant fifth force can change the stability
and structure of the background configuration. For linear perturbations, we
derive a lower bound for the square of the Fourier mode frequency $\omega^2$
using the adiabatic approximation. There may be unstable modes if this lower
bound is negative, and we find that the condition of the instability can be
changed by the fifth force although this effect is suppressed by the screening
parameter. For non-linear perturbations, because we are mainly interested in
short wavelength modes for which the fifth force may become stronger, we
perform numerical simulations under the planar approximation. For a
sufficiently large initial amplitude of the density perturbation, we find that
the magnitude of the fifth force can be comparable to that of Newtonian gravity
even when the model parameters are chosen so that the static background is well
screened. It is also shown that if the screening is effective for the static
background, the fluid dynamics is mostly governed by the pressure gradient and

different programming languages. These systems introduce several advantages.
However, as the number of languages increases, so does the challenges related
to the development and maintenance of these systems. In such situations,
developers may introduce design smells (i.e., anti-patterns and code smells)
which are symptoms of poor design and implementation choices. Design smells are
defined as poor design and coding choices that can negatively impact the
quality of a software program despite satisfying functional requirements.
Studies on mono-language systems suggest that the presence of design smells
affects code comprehension, thus making systems harder to maintain. However,
these studies target only mono-language systems and do not consider the
interaction between different programming languages. In this paper, we present
an approach to detect multi-language design smells in the context of JNI
systems. We then investigate the prevalence of those design smells.
Specifically, we detect 15 design smells in 98 releases of nine open-source JNI
projects. Our results show that the design smells are prevalent in the selected

the analyzed systems, 33.95% of the files involving communications between Java

smells are more prevalent than others, e.g., Unused Parameters, Too Much

without these smells, and that specific smells are more correlated to

Burst found to be associated with a counterpart, a steady radio source with a
nearly flat spectral energy distribution (SED) in centimeter wavelengths.
  Aims. Previous observations of the persistent source down to $1.6$~GHz has
shown no sign of a spectral turn-over. Absorption is expected to eventually
cause a turn-over at lower frequencies. Better constraints on the physical
parameters of the emitting medium can be derived by detecting the
self-absorption frequency.
  Methods. We used the Giant Metre-Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) during the
period of July to December 2017 to observe the source at low radio frequencies
down to $400$~MHz.
  Results. The spectral energy distribution of the source remains optically
thin even at $400$~MHz, with a spectral index of $\nu^{-(0.07 \pm 0.03)}$
similar to what is seen in Galactic plerions. Using a generic synchrotron
radiation model, we obtain constraints on properties of the non-thermal plasma
and the central engine powering it.
  Conclusions. We present low-frequency detections of the persistent source
associated with FRB121102. Its characteristic flat SED extends down to
$400$~MHz. Like Galactic plerions, the energy in the persistent source is
carried predominantly by leptons. The emitting plasma has a $B< 0.01$~G, and
its age is $> 524 \left(\frac{B}{0.01 {\rm G}} \right)^{-3/2}$. We show that
the energetics of the persistent source requires an initial spin period shorter
than 36~ms, and the magnetic field of the neutron star must exceed $4.5\times
10^{12}$~G. This implies that the persistent source does not necessarily
require energetic input from a magnetar.

means of assigning the generator a social identity. However, pragmatics theory
suggests that human beings adjust the way of speaking based on not only who

personalised dialogues, it might be favourable if we also take the listener's
social identity into consideration. To validate this idea, we use gender as a
typical example of a social variable to investigate how the listener's identity
influences the language used in Chinese dialogues on social media. Also, we
build personalised generators. The experiment results demonstrate that the
listener's identity indeed matters in the language use of responses and that
the response generator can capture such differences in language use. More
interestingly, by additionally modelling the listener's identity, the
personalised response generator performs better in its own identity.

achieving vibrational strong coupling (VSC) with molecules. Although the onset
of VSC has recently been observed spectroscopically with PP nanoresonators, no
experiments so far have resolved VSC in real space and with propagating modes
in unstructured layers. Here, we demonstrate by real-space nanoimaging that VSC
can be achieved between propagating PPs in thin vdW crystals (specifically
h-BN) and molecular vibrations in adjacent thin molecular layers. To that end,
we performed near-field polariton interferometry, showing that VSC leads to the
formation of a propagating hybrid mode with a pronounced anti-crossing region
in its dispersion, in which propagation with negative group velocity is found.
Numerical calculations predict VSC for nanometer-thin molecular layers and PPs
in few-layer vdW materials, which could make propagating PPs a promising
platform for ultra-sensitive on-chip spectroscopy and strong coupling

we compute the helicity amplitude as well as the decay width of $\eta_{Q2}$
($Q=c,b$) electromagnetic decay into two photons up to next-to-next-to-leading
order (NNLO) in $\alpha_s$ expansion. For the first time, we verify the
validity of NRQCD factorization for the D-wave quarkonium decay at NNLO. We
find that the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ corrections
to the helicity amplitude are negative and moderate, nevertheless both
corrections combine to suppress the leading-order prediction for the decay
width significantly. By approximating the total decay width of $\eta_{Q2}$ as
the sum of those for the hadronic decay and the electric $E1$ transition, we
obtain the branching ratios ${\rm Br}(\eta_{c2}\to 2\gamma)\approx
5\times10^{-6}$ and ${\rm Br}(\eta_{b2}\to 2\gamma)\approx 4\times10^{-7}$. To
explore the potential measurement on $\eta_{Q2}$, we further evaluate the
production cross section of $\eta_{Q2}$ at LHCb at the lowest order in
$\alpha_s$ expansion. With the kinematic constraint on the longitudinal
rapidity $4.5>y>2$ and transverse momentum $P_T>(2-4)m_Q$ for $\eta_{Q2}$, we
find the cross section can reach $2-50$ nb for $\eta_{c2}$, and $1-22$ pb for
$\eta_{b2}$. Considering the integrated luminosity $\mathcal{L}=10\, {\rm
fb}^{-1}$ at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV, we estimate that there are
several hundreds events of $pp\to \eta_{c2}\to 2\gamma$. Since the background
is relatively clean, it is promising to reconstruct $\eta_{c2}$ through its
electromagnetic decay. On the contrary, due to small branching ratio and
production cross section, it is quite challenging to detect $\eta_{b2}\to
2\gamma$ at LHCb.

out in artificial ponds that become breeding sites. Evidence has been found
indicating that cleaning the vegetation from the edges of the crop tanks helps
to control the size of the mosquito population.
  We use our model to determine the effective contribution of fish farming
practices on malaria transmission dynamics. The model consists of a nonlinear
system of ordinary differential equations with jumps at the cleaning time,
which act as impulsive controls. We study the asymptotic behaviour of the
system in function of the intensity and periodicity of the cleaning, and the
value of the parameters. In particular, we state sufficient conditions under

malaria is eliminated or becomes endemic. We prove our conditions by applying

planetesimals on eccentric orbits could simply explode as they become
supersonic in comparison to small, porous planetary bodies entering Earth's
atmosphere. We present a toy model of planetesimal motion and destruction to
show the key aspects of this process. The consequences are quite severe. At all
times, it is shown that only planetesimals on more or less circular orbits
exist in the inner disk. After the destruction of a planetesimal, the remaining
matter is continuously redistributed to the pebble reservoir of the
protoplanetary disk. Since destruction typically occurs at small stellar
distances due to supersonic speeds, it is expected to boost pebble accretion in
the inner protoplanetary disk as one of its main effects.

the temperature and radial density profile of this gas can be used to measure
the total mass of the galaxy contained within a given radius r. We use this
technique for 102 early-type galaxies (ETGs) with stellar masses M_* > 10^10
M_Sun, to evaluate the mass fraction of dark matter (DM) within the fiducial
radius r = 5 r_e, denoted f_5 = f_{DM}(5r_e). On average, these systems have a
median f_5 = 0.8 - 0.9 with a typical galaxy-to-galaxy scatter +-0.15.
Comparisons with mass estimates made through the alternative techniques of
satellite dynamics (e.g. velocity distributions of globular clusters, planetary
nebulae, satellite dwarfs) as well as strong lensing show encouraging
consistency over the same range of stellar mass. We find that many of the disk
galaxies (S0/SA0/SB0) have a significantly higher mean $f_5$ than do the pure
ellipticals, by Delta f_5 = 0.1. We suggest that this higher level may be a
consequence of sparse stellar haloes and quieter histories with fewer major
episodes of feedback or mergers. Comparisons are made with the Magneticum
Pathfinder suite of simulations for both normal and centrally dominant
""Brightest Cluster"" galaxies. Though the observed data exhibit somewhat larger
scatter at a given galaxy mass than do the simulations, the mean level of DM
mass fraction for all classes of galaxies is in good first-order agreement with
the simulations. Lastly, we find that the group galaxies with stellar masses
near M_* ~ 10^11 M_Sun have relatively more outliers at low $f_5$ than in other
mass ranges, possibly the result of especially effective AGN feedback in that
mass range leading to expansion of their dark matter halos.

patterns and nearly 100$\%$ linear polarization. Following the model of
\citet{dai 2016} who proposed that repeating FRBs may originate from a
slowly-rotating, old-aged pulsar colliding with an asteroid belt around a
stellar-mass object, we focus on the prediction of time--frequency drifting and
polarization. In this scenario, the frequency drifting is mainly caused by the
geometric structure of a pulsar magnetosphere, and the drifting rate--frequency
index is found to be $25/17$. On the other hand, by considering the typical
differential mass distribution of incident asteroids, we find that an asteroid
with mass $m\gtrsim 10^{17}~{\rm g}$ colliding with the pulsar would contribute
abundant gravitational energy, which powers an FRB. A broad frequency band of
the FRBs would be expected, due to the mass difference of the incident
asteroids. In addition, we simulate the linear polarization distribution for
the repeating FRBs, and constrain the linear polarization with $\gtrsim$ 30$\%$

explicit solutions for the linear systems; then, we analyze a selected example.
We obtain a probabilistic interpretation of Frank t-norms and t-conorms as
prevision of conjunctions and disjunctions of conditional events, respectively.
Then, we characterize the sets of coherent prevision assessments on a family

we show that any Frank t-norm (resp., t-conorm) of two conditional events $A|H$

conjunction $(A|H)\wedge (B|K)$ (resp., a disjunction $(A|H)\vee (B|K)$). By
considering a family $\mathcal{F}$ containing three conditional events, their
conjunction, and all pairwise conjunctions we give some results on Frank
t-norms and coherence of the prevision assessments on $\mathcal{F}$. By
assuming logical independence, we show that it is coherent to assess the
previsions of all the conjunctions by means of Minimum and Product t-norms. We
verify by a counterexample that, when the previsions of conjunctions are
assessed by the Lukasiewicz t-norm, coherence is not assured.

It is shown that the asymmetric elliptical micro-cone formations induced by

spatial asymmetry. By contrast, the use of azimuthally polarized beams leads to
an omni-directionality of the elliptical cone orientation which is dependent on
the local electric field during laser scanning. The locally variant electric
field state that is azimuthally polarized leads to a selective conical

network with stochastic events, this paper studies the dynamics of the
resulting Markov random network and characterizes a novel phenomenon of
intermittent synchronization and desynchronization that is due to an interplay
of the two forms of randomness in the system. On a finite state space and in
discrete time, the network allows for unperturbed (or ""deterministic"")
randomness that represents the extrinsic noise but also for small intrinsic
uncertainties modelled by a Markov perturbation. It is shown that if the
deterministic random network is synchronized (resp., uniformly synchronized),
then for almost all realizations of its extrinsic noise the stochastic
trajectories of the perturbed network synchronize along almost all (resp.,
along all) time sequences after a certain time, with high probability. That is,
both the probability of synchronization and the proportion of time spent in
synchrony are arbitrarily close to one. Under smooth Markov perturbations,
high-probability synchronization and low-probability desynchronization occur
intermittently in time, which can both be precisely described via an asymptotic
expansion of the invariant distribution. Existence and uniqueness of invariant
distributions are established, as well as their convergence as the perturbation
parameter vanishes. An explicit asymptotic expansion is derived. Ergodicity of
the extrinsic noise dynamics is seen to be crucial for the characterization of
(de)synchronization sets and their respective relative frequencies. An example
of a smooth Markov perturbation of a synchronized probabilistic Boolean network
is provided to illustrate the intermittency between high-probability
synchronization and low-probability desynchronization.

Sb$_2$Te$_2$Se has been studied at room temperature on dominantly c-axis
oriented granular polycrystalline samples grown by pulsed laser deposition
technique. Strong spin-orbit coupling and spin-momentum locking make this
system unique for their applications. We observed that photocurrent can be
controlled by exciting the sample with different circular and linear polarized
light, yielding a polarization-dependent current density which can be fitted
very well with a theoretical model. Magnitude of the photocurrent is higher
even at room temperature, compared to previous reports on other single-crystal
topological insulators. Comparison with the theoretical model suggests that
photocurrent has different contributions. Study of dependence of photocurrent
on the angle of incidence (wave-vector) of the excitation laser beam with
respect to the surface normal of the sample helps to identify origins of
different terms contributing to the observed photocurrent. Incidence-angle
driven helicity switching, which is a very simple and effective technique to
control the directional photocurrent, has also been observed in this study.
This photocurrent can also be controlled with the help of photothermal gradient
generated by the excitation light beam. Enhancement and inversion of this
photocurrent in presence of photothermal gradient for light incident on two
opposite edges of the sample occur due to selective spin state excitation with
two opposite (left and right) circularly polarized light in presence of the
unique spin-momentum locked surface states. These observations renders this
polycrystalline material to be more important in polarization-dependent
photodetection applications as well as for spin-optoelectronics under ambient

injecting energy and angular momentum at the microscale demonstrates
spontaneous collective states that range from flocks to coherent vortices.
Despite their seeming simplicity, the emergent far-from-equilibrium behavior of
these fluids remains poorly understood, presenting a challenge to the design
and control of next-generation active materials. When confined in a ring, such
so-called polar active fluids acquire chirality once the spontaneous flow
chooses a direction. In a perfect ring, this chirality is indefinitely
long-lived. Here, we combine experiments on self-propelled colloidal Quincke
rollers and mesoscopic simulations of continuum Toner-Tu equations to explore
how such chiral states can be controlled and manipulated by obstacles. For
different obstacle geometries three dynamic steady states have been realized:
long-lived chiral flow, an apolar state in which the flow breaks up into
counter-rotating vortices and an unconventional collective state with flow
having an oscillating chirality. The chirality reversal proceeds through the
formation of intermittent vortex chains in the vicinity of an obstacle. We
demonstrate that the frequency of collective states with oscillating chirality
can be tuned by obstacle parameters. We vary obstacle shapes to design chiral
states that are independent of initial conditions. Building on our findings, we
realize a system with two triangular obstacles that force the active fluid
towards a state with a density imbalance of active particles across the ring.
Our results demonstrate how spontaneous polar active flows in combination with
size and geometry of scatterers can be used to control dynamic patterns of
polar active liquids for materials design.

the influence of the overall function of the fin profile affecting the
volumetric rate of stored thermal energy. The imposed boundary conditions are
adiabatic type on the tip of the fin and prescribed base temperature. A hybrid
mathematical method, known as the Generalized Integral Transform Technique
(GITT), was used to solve the cases presented here. The results obtained with
GITT were firstly validated with FEM results, presenting excellent agreement
between them, proving been a method suitable for handling non-linear problems.
Physical effects on the temperature distribution and efficiency due to the
thermo-geometric parameter (M), internal heat generation (Q), and variable
thermal conductivity were investigated.The analysis shows that increasing M or
decreasing Q results in a longer transient period, regardless of the geometry
assessed. Besides, the efficiency if the increasing linear shape is higher than
those of the rectangular fin for any parameter choice. Moreover, depending on
the thermo-geometric value, the rectangular fin becomes more efficient among
the remaining shapes. However, for higher values, those differences become
undistinguished from each other, demonstrating a significant impact of the
varying cross-sectional area and the fin surface area on the overall thermal

the basic iterative gradient ascent scheme for optimizing the rate reduction of

parameters of the network are all explicitly constructed layer-by-layer in a
forward propagation fashion by emulating the gradient scheme. All components of

of multi-channel lifting and sparse coding in early stage of deep networks.
Moreover, all linear operators of the so-derived network naturally become
multi-channel convolutions when we enforce classification to be rigorously
shift-invariant. The derivation also indicates that such a convolutional

field and challenge some common assumptions. We first theoretically show that
the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is fundamentally
impossible without inductive biases on both the models and the data. Then, we
train over $14000$ models covering most prominent methods and evaluation
metrics in a reproducible large-scale experimental study on eight data sets. We
observe that while the different methods successfully enforce properties
""encouraged"" by the corresponding losses, well-disentangled models seemingly
cannot be identified without supervision. Furthermore, different evaluation
metrics do not always agree on what should be considered ""disentangled"" and
exhibit systematic differences in the estimation. Finally, increased
disentanglement does not seem to necessarily lead to a decreased sample
complexity of learning for downstream tasks. Our results suggest that future
work on disentanglement learning should be explicit about the role of inductive
biases and (implicit) supervision, investigate concrete benefits of enforcing
disentanglement of the learned representations, and consider a reproducible

Starting from an initial random configuration, its particles are moved

network infrastructure in which in-network computation can help accelerating
the performance of applications. This can be achieved by offloading some
computational tasks to the network. However, what kind of computational tasks
should be delegated to the network to accelerate applications performance? In
this paper, we propose a way to exploit the usage of programmable switches to
scale up the performance of distributed key-value stores. Moreover, as a
proof-of-concept, we propose TurboKV, an efficient distributed key-value store
architecture that utilizes programmable switches as: 1) partition management
nodes to store the key-value store partitions and replicas information; and 2)
monitoring stations to measure the load of storage nodes, this monitoring
information is used to balance the load among storage nodes. We also propose a
key-based routing protocol to route the search queries of clients based on the
requested keys to targeted storage nodes. Our experimental results of an
initial prototype show that our proposed architecture improves the throughput
and reduces the latency of distributed key-value stores when compared to the

unsupervised graph representation learning. Most graph CL methods first perform
stochastic augmentation on the input graph to obtain two graph views and
maximize the agreement of representations in the two views. Despite the
prosperous development of graph CL methods, the design of graph augmentation
schemes -- a crucial component in CL -- remains rarely explored. We argue that
the data augmentation schemes should preserve intrinsic structures and
attributes of graphs, which will force the model to learn representations that
are insensitive to perturbation on unimportant nodes and edges. However, most
existing methods adopt uniform data augmentation schemes, like uniformly
dropping edges and uniformly shuffling features, leading to suboptimal
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel graph contrastive representation
learning method with adaptive augmentation that incorporates various priors for
topological and semantic aspects of the graph. Specifically, on the topology
level, we design augmentation schemes based on node centrality measures to
highlight important connective structures. On the node attribute level, we
corrupt node features by adding more noise to unimportant node features, to
enforce the model to recognize underlying semantic information. We perform
extensive experiments of node classification on a variety of real-world
datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method
consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines and even surpasses
some supervised counterparts, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed
contrastive framework with adaptive augmentation.

enabling modern lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries. Their properties determine the
cycle life, performance, and safety of batteries. A special case is the solid
electrolyte interphase (SEI), a heterogeneous multi-component film formed due
to the instability and subsequent decomposition of the electrolyte at the
surface of the anode. The SEI acts as a passivating layer that hinders further
electrolyte disintegration, which is detrimental to the Coulombic efficiency.
In this work, we use first-principles simulations to investigate the kinetic
and electronic properties of the interface between lithium fluoride (LiF) and
lithium carbonate (Li$_2$CO$_3$), two common SEI components present in Li-ion
batteries with organic liquid electrolytes. We find a coherent interface
between these components that restricts the strain in each of them to below 3%.
We find that the interface causes a large increase in the formation energy of
the Frenkel defect, generating Li vacancies in LiF and Li interstitials in
Li$_2$CO$_3$ responsible for transport. On the other hand, the Li interstitial
hopping barrier is reduced from $0.3$ eV in bulk Li$_2$CO$_3$ to $0.10$ or
$0.22$ eV in the interfacial structure considered, demonstrating the favorable
role of the interface. Controlling these two effects in a heterogeneous SEI is
crucial for maintaining fast ion transport in the SEI. We further perform
Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics simulations to explore Li ion conduction in
our interfacial structure, which reveal an enhanced Li ion diffusion in the
vicinity of the interface. Understanding the interfacial properties of the

  Cloud Processing",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent advancements of three-dimensional (3D) data acquisition devices
have spurred a new breed of applications that rely on point cloud data
processing. However, processing a large volume of point cloud data brings a
significant workload on resource-constrained mobile devices, prohibiting from
unleashing their full potentials. Built upon the emerging paradigm of
device-edge co-inference, where an edge device extracts and transmits the
intermediate feature to an edge server for further processing, we propose
Branchy-GNN for efficient graph neural network (GNN) based point cloud
processing by leveraging edge computing platforms. In order to reduce the
on-device computational cost, the Branchy-GNN adds branch networks for early
exiting. Besides, it employs learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC)
for the intermediate feature compression to reduce the communication overhead.
Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Branchy-GNN secures a
significant latency reduction compared with several benchmark methods.

consisting of a multi-channel bidirectional current-mirror based potentiostat
and a multiplexed current-input delta-sigma ($\Delta \Sigma$) ADC is presented.
Slice-based class-AB amplifiers with output stage current replication using
reconfigurable current-mirrors enable bidirectional current sensing over a
range of five decades. The replicated current is digitized by the ADC. The
proposed circuit achieves a minimum detectable current of 91.7 pA, resulting in
a dynamic range of 147 dB for sensor currents up to $\pm$1 mA. The potentiostat
is operated at a 3 V supply, the ADC at 1.5 V. The static power consumption of
a single interface channel depends on the number of active amplifier slices and
is between 14.1 $\mu$W and 39.3 $\mu$W. The highest power efficiency among
similar systems and the low voltage headroom consumption of less than 500 mV
enables a versatile use of the interface for multiple sensing applications.

paper extends the widely used canonical correlation analysis (CCA) decoder to

the sum of absolute value of the coefficients in the linear combination of the

analysis of the composition and structure of the corresponding explosion

laser interferometry and shadow imaging at two wavelengths (1.064~$\mu$m and

visualization of the explosion products belongs to multiple scattering by
submicron droplets of dense condensed matter, which are mixed with metal vapor.
The hypothesis on the existence of submicron droplets in the products of
exploding metal wires correlates with the results obtained by soft x-ray
radiography combined with a laser probing technique. Taking into account the
multiple scattering by submicron droplets, it is possible to significantly
clarify the parameters of the explosion products visualized via laser probing
techniques as well as to gain a deeper insight into the physics behind the

prone to topographic distortion induced by resist shrinkage. Characterizing the
impact of this effect on blazed diffraction efficiency is particularly
important for applications in astrophysical spectroscopy at soft x-ray
wavelengths ($\lambda \approx 0.5 - 5$~nm) that call for the mass-production of
large-area grating replicas with sub-micron, sawtooth surface-relief profiles.
A variant of NIL that lends itself well for this task is substrate-conformal
imprint lithography (SCIL), which uses a flexible, composite stamp formed from
a rigid master template to imprint nanoscale features in an inorganic resist
that cures thermodynamically through a silica sol-gel process. While SCIL
enables the production of several hundred imprints before stamp degradation and
avoids many of the detriments associated with large-area imprinting in NIL, the
sol-gel resist suffers shrinkage dependent on the post-imprint cure
temperature. Through atomic force microscopy and diffraction-efficiency testing
at beamline 6.3.2 of the Advanced Light Source, the impact of this effect on
blaze response is constrained for a $\sim$160-nm-period grating replica cured
at 90$^{\circ}$C. Results demonstrate a $\sim$2$^{\circ}$ reduction in blaze
angle relative to the master grating, which was fabricated by anisotropic wet
etching in $\langle 311 \rangle$-oriented silicon to yield a facet angle close
to 30$^{\circ}$.
