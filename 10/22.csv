assess students' answers during exams automatically. Several challenges can
arise in making an automatic short answer scoring system, one of which is the
quantity and quality of the data. The data labeling process is not easy because
it requires a human annotator who is an expert in their field. Further, the
data imbalance process is also a challenge because the number of labels for
correct answers is always much less than the wrong answers. In this paper, we
propose the use of a stacking model based on neural network and XGBoost for
classification process with sentence embedding feature. We also propose to use
data upsampling method to handle imbalance classes and hyperparameters
optimization algorithm to find a robust model automatically. We use Ukara 1.0
Challenge dataset and our best model obtained an F1-score of 0.821 exceeding
the previous work at the same dataset.

specimen of heterogeneous materials focusing on how the system approaches
perforation as the impact energy is gradually increased. A simple model is
constructed which represents the bar as two rigid blocks coupled by a breakable
interface with disordered local strength. The bar is clamped at the two ends
and the fracture process is initiated by an impactor hitting the bar in the
middle. Our calculations revealed that depending on the imparted energy, the
system has two phases: at low impact energies the bar suffers damage but keeps
its integrity, while at sufficiently high energies, complete perforation
occurs. We demonstrate that the transition from damage to perforation occurs
analogous to continuous phase transitions. Approaching the critical point from
below, the intact fraction of the interface goes to zero, while the deformation
rate of the bar diverges according to power laws as function of the distance
from the critical energy. As the degree of disorder increases, further from the
transition point the critical exponents agree with their zero disorder
counterparts, however, close to the critical point a crossover occurs to a
higher exponent.

the citation contexts of the DSM and its status as a valid instrument being
used and described by psychological researchers. We specifically focused on how
this relationship has changed over the DSM's citation histories, especially
through the temporal framework of its versions. We found that a new version of
the DSM is increasingly regarded as a valid instrument after its publication;
this is reflected in various key citation contexts, such as the use of hedges,
attention markers, and the verb profile in sentences where the DSM is cited. We
call this process the re-instrumentalization of the DSM in the space of
scientific publications. Our findings bridge an important gap between
quantitative and qualitative science studies and shed light on an aspect of the
social process of scientific instrument development that is not addressed by
the current qualitative literature.

designed achieving output synchronization for identical finite-dimensional
reference models, which deliver the state of the global reference model
required for the synchronization to the parabolic agents. The latter can be
subject to local disturbances acting in-domain, on all boundaries and on the
anti-collocated output to be controlled. The cooperative output regulation
problem is solved by designing local output feedback regulators for the
parabolic agents. This requires the solution of time-varying regulator
equations and the design of disturbance observers for parabolic systems with
spatially- and time-varying coefficients. For this, a systematic backstepping
approach is provided and it is shown that cooperative output regulation with
exponential convergence is ensured for the resulting multi-agent system. The
results of the paper are applied to the cooperative output regulation of a

learning and memory in these disorders? To address this question, we simulated
drug effects within a computational model describing induction of late
long-term potentiation (L-LTP). Biochemical pathways impaired in these and
other disorders converge on a common target, histone acetylation by
acetyltransferases such as CREB binding protein (CBP), which facilitates gene
induction necessary for L-LTP. We focused on four drug classes: tropomyosin
receptor kinase B (TrkB) agonists, cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors, histone
deacetylase inhibitors, and ampakines. Simulations suggested each drug type
alone may rescue deficits in L-LTP. A potential disadvantage, however, was the
necessity of simulating strong drug effects (high doses), which could produce
adverse side effects. Thus, we investigated the effects of six drug pairs among
the four classes described above. These combination treatments normalized
impaired L-LTP with substantially smaller drug doses. In addition three of
these combinations, a TrkB agonist paired with an ampakine and a cAMP
phosphodiesterase inhibitor paired with a TrkB agonist or an ampakine,
exhibited strong synergism in L-LTP rescue. Therefore, we suggest these drug
combinations are promising candidates for further empirical studies in animal
models of genetic disorders that impair acetylation, L-LTP, and learning.

converters is assessed in adversarial conditions, specifically against

kind, it is shown that the gate signal that controls the converter switches can
be manipulated, to catastrophic effect; i.e., it is possible for an attacker to
control the switching state of individual transistors to cause irreparable
damage to the converter and associated systems. Finally, a discussion of
countermeasures for hardware designers to mitigate IEMI-based attacks is

sedimentation profoundly alters the chemical profiles of ultra-massive ($M_*> 1

inward toward the core, and thus leading to much narrower chemical transition
zones. As a result, significant changes in the $g$-mode pulsation periods as

taken into account in detailed asteroseismological analyses of such stars. For

how a thin elastic layer, such as a coating, deforms when subject to a
distributed normal load: the deformation of the layer is assumed proportional
to the applied normal load. This simplicity means that the Winkler model has
found a wide range of applications from soft matter to geophysics. However, in
the limit of an incompressible elastic layer the model predicts infinite
resistance to deformation, and hence breaks down. Since many of the thin layers
used in applications are elastomeric, and hence close to incompressible, we
consider the question of when the Winkler model is appropriate for such layers.
We formally derive a model that interpolates between the Winkler and
incompressible limits for thin elastic layers, and illustrate this model by
detailed consideration of two example problems: the point indentation of a
coated elastomeric layer and self-sustained lift in soft elastohydrodynamic
lubrication. We find that the applicability (or otherwise) of the Winkler model
is not determined by the value of the Poisson ratio alone, but by a
compressibility parameter that combines the Poisson ratio with a measure of the
layer's slenderness that depends on the problem under consideration.

localization scenarios may appear for finite $N$ and close to the transition
point. These scenarios are characterized by the presence or the absence of a
minimum of $Y_2$ when plotted against $N$ and by an exponent $\gamma\geq 2$

were evaluated in terms of resource overheads. Experimental results show that
both variants can recover the network topology, up to a certain node failure
rate, which depends on the network topology. At the same time, Mobile Agents
collect less information, focusing on local dissemination, which suffices for
network recovery. This entails less bandwidth overheads than when Trickle is
used. Still, Mobile Agents utilise more memory and exchange more messages,
during data-collection, than Trickle does. These results validate the viability
of the proposed self-healing solution, offering two variant implementations
with diverse performance characteristics, which may suit different application

Existing approaches including Early and Late Penalties and Constrained

the electric dipoles, which are usually random and dynamic, become paired in
the MF state in (d,-d) pairs, thus strongly reducing their electric activity.
The electric currents existing in systems with noncoplanar spins are also
strongly influenced by MF. We also consider modifications in dipole and current

developing high PV penetration models based on the validated dynamic model of

displacement of conventional generators by PV is realized by optimization.
Combining the PV distribution optimization and the validated dynamic model

problem of finding the top-$r$ leading principal components such that all these
principal components are linear combinations of a common subset of at most $k$
variables. SPCAgs is a popular dimension reduction tool in statistics that
enhances interpretability compared to regular principal component analysis
(PCA). Methods for solving SPCAgs in the literature are either greedy
heuristics (in the special case of $r = 1$) with guarantees under restrictive
statistical models or algorithms with stationary point convergence for some
regularized reformulation of SPCAgs. Crucially, none of the existing
computational methods can efficiently guarantee the quality of the solutions
obtained by comparing them against dual bounds.
  In this work, we first propose a convex relaxation based on operator norms
that provably approximates the feasible region of SPCAgs within a $c_1 + c_2
\sqrt{\log r} = O(\sqrt{\log r})$ factor for some constants $c_1, c_2$. To
prove this result, we use a novel random sparsification procedure that uses the
Pietsch-Grothendieck factorization theorem and may be of independent interest.
We also propose a simpler relaxation that is second-order cone representable
and gives a $(2\sqrt{r})$-approximation for the feasible region.
  Using these relaxations, we then propose a convex integer program that
provides a dual bound for the optimal value of SPCAgs. Moreover, it also has
worst-case guarantees: it is within a multiplicative/additive factor of the
original optimal value, and the multiplicative factor is $O(\log r)$ or $O(r)$
depending on the relaxation used.
  Finally, we conduct computational experiments that show that our convex
integer program provides, within a reasonable time, good upper bounds that are
typically significantly better than the natural baselines.

an optimized model over the best performance on the distribution of all tasks,
generating reliable signatures for new tasks, i.e., signatures of unseen point
neighborhoods. Specifically, the MEPS consists of two modules: a base signature
learner and a meta signature learner. During training, the base-learner is
trained to perform specific signature learning tasks. In the meantime, the
meta-learner is trained to update the base-learner with optimal parameters.
During testing, the meta-learner that is learned with the distribution of all
tasks can adaptively change parameters of the base-learner, accommodating to
unseen local neighborhoods. We evaluate the MEPS model on two datasets, e.g.,
FAUST and TOSCA, for dense 3Dshape correspondence. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method not only gains significant improvements over the
baseline model and achieves state-of-the-art results, but also is capable of
handling unseen 3D shapes.

star-shaped curve under a broad class of curvature-driven geometric flows,

parameters that control one constant and one curvature-dependent component for
the velocity in the direction of the normal to the curve. The Andrews-Bloore
flow includes as special cases the well known Eikonal, curve-shortening and
affine shortening flows, and for positive parameter values its evolution
shrinks the area enclosed by the curve to zero in finite time. A question of
key interest has been how the shape itself, as well as various shape
descriptors evolve as this limit is approached. Star-like curves can be
represented by a periodic scalar polar distance function $r(\varphi)$ measured
from a reference point. An important question is how the numbers and the
trajectories of critical points of the distance function $r(\varphi)$ and of
the curvature $\kappa(\varphi)$ evolve under the Andrews-Bloore flows for
different choices of the parameters. Our method is specifically designed to
meet the challenge of computing accurate trajectories of these critical points

piecewise polynomial periodic distance function, as determined by a chosen
mesh; different types of meshes and mesh adaptation can be chosen to ensure a
good balance between accuracy and computational cost. As we demonstrate with
benchmark tests and two longer case studies, our method allows one to perform
numerical investigations into subtle questions of planar curve evolution. More
specifically we provide illustrations of some known results, numerical evidence

$\mathbb{I}(\mathbf{GP}^+)$ is cofree. It is the terminal object in the
category of Hopf monoids with polynomial characters; this partially explains
the ubiquity of generalized permutahedra in the theory of Hopf monoids.
  This Hopf theoretic framework offers a simple, unified explanation for many
new and old valuations on generalized permutahedra and their subfamilies.
Examples include, for matroids: the Chern-Schwartz-MacPherson cycles, Eur's
volume polynomial, the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomial, the motivic zeta function,
and the Derksen-Fink invariant; for posets: the order polynomial, Poincar\'e

universal Tutte character and the corresponding class in the Chow ring of the

matrices beating the square-root bottleneck on the sparsity level. In this
paper, we investigate RIP of certain matrices defined by higher power residues
modulo primes. Moreover, we prove that the widely-believed generalized Paley

$\omega$ follow a universal density of states ${\cal
D}(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$. Yet, the underlying physics behind this
universality is not fully understood. Here we study a mean-field model of
quasilocalized excitations in glasses, viewed as groups of particles embedded
inside an elastic medium and described collectively as anharmonic oscillators.
The oscillators, whose harmonic stiffness is taken from a rather featureless
probability distribution (of upper cutoff $\kappa_0$) in the absence of
interactions, interact among themselves through random couplings (characterized
by strength $J$) and with the surrounding elastic medium (an interaction
characterized by a constant force $h$). We first show that the model gives rise
to a gapless density of states ${\cal D}(\omega)\!=\!A_{\rm g}\,\omega^4$ for a
broad range of model parameters, expressed in terms of the strength of
stabilizing anharmonicity, which plays a decisive role in the model. Then --
using scaling theory and numerical simulations -- we provide a complete
understanding of the non-universal prefactor $A_{\rm g}(h,J,\kappa_0)$, of the
oscillators' interaction-induced mean square displacement and of an emerging
characteristic frequency, all in terms of properly identified dimensionless
quantities. In particular, we show that $A_{\rm g}(h,J,\kappa_0)$ is a
nonmonotonic function of $J$ for a fixed $h$, varying predominantly
exponentially with $-(\kappa_0 h^{2/3}\!/J^2)$ in the weak interactions (small
$J$) regime -- reminiscent of recent observations in computer glasses -- and
predominantly decaying as a power-law for larger $J$, in a regime where $h$
plays no role. We discuss the physical interpretation of the model and its
possible relations to available observations in structural glasses, along with
delineating some future research directions.

stellar and dust distributions, with the dust on the near side relative to the

  - We construct an SSL scheme for pseudorandom functions from the LWE

  - We construct an SSL scheme for a subclass of evasive functions from the LWE

  - We construct SSL schemes for the functionalities above with classical

adversaries. SSL with classical communication means that entities exchange only
classical information though they run quantum computation locally.

work and a relaxed version of quantum lighting. In two-tier quantum lightning
schemes, we have a public verification algorithm called semi-verification and a
private verification algorithm called full-verification. An adversary cannot
generate possibly entangled two quantum states whose serial numbers are the

symmetries, Goldstones's theorem demands the existence of massless, spin-zero
excitations in a one-to-one correspondence with the broken symmetry generators.
When a system spontaneously breaks Poincar\'e symmetry, however, the kinds of
excitations that satisfy Goldstone's theorem can be quite unusual. In
particular, they may have any spin and need not be particles or even
quasiparticles. The standard coset construction used to formulate effective
actions of Goldstones, however, is rather restrictive and is incapable of
generating the full spectrum of possibilities allowed by Goldstone's theorem.
We propose a (partial) remedy to this problem by postulating a novel coset
construction for systems that spontaneously break Poincar\'e symmetry. This new
construction is capable of generating effective actions with a wide range of
Goldstone excitations---including fermionic degrees of freedom---even when all
symmetries are bosonic. To demonstrate it's utility, we focus on constructing
effective actions for point particles of various spins. We recover the known
result that a particle of spin $s$ requires an $\mathcal N=2s$ supersymmetric
worldline reparameterization gauge symmetry, which we implement at the level of
the coset construction. In the process, we discover that massless particles
require a novel kind of inverse Higgs constraint that bears some resemblance to
the dynamical inverse Higgs constraints that appear in certain fermi liquid
effective field theories. We then consider particles that, in addition to
quantum spin, have finite spatial extent and are free to rotate. We derive a
novel action for such particles and find a `spin-orbital' coupling between the
intrinsic quantum spin and the physical-rotation degrees of freedom.

multiple compact sub-components, embedded in a more diffuse and faint radio
emission, which enshrouds them in a continuous jet structure. We derive limits
on some physical parameters directly from the observable quantities, such as
viewing angle, Lorentz and Doppler factors. If PSO J0309+27 is a genuine
blazar, as suggested by its X-ray properties, then we find that its bulk
Lorentz factor must be relatively low (less than 5). Such value would be in
favour of a scenario currently proposed to reconcile the paucity of high-z
blazars with respect to current predictions. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude
that PSO J0309+27 is seen under a larger viewing angle, which would imply that
the X-ray emission must be enhanced, for example, by inverse Compton with the

identify and characterize such pre-explosion outbursts we produce
forced-photometry light curves for 196 interacting SNe, mostly of Type IIn,
detected by the Zwicky Transient Facility between early 2018 and June 2020.
Extensive tests demonstrate that we only expect a few false detections among
the 70,000 analyzed pre-explosion images after applying quality cuts and bias
corrections. We detect precursor eruptions prior to 18 Type IIn SNe and prior
to the Type Ibn SN2019uo. Precursors become brighter and more frequent in the
last months before the SN and month-long outbursts brighter than magnitude -13
occur prior to 25% (5 - 69%, 95% confidence range) of all Type IIn SNe within
the final three months before the explosion. With radiative energies of up to
$10^{49}\,\text{erg}$, precursors could eject $\sim1\,\text{M}_\odot$ of
material. Nevertheless, SNe with detected precursors are not significantly more
luminous than other SNe IIn and the characteristic narrow hydrogen lines in
their spectra typically originate from earlier, undetected mass-loss events.
The long precursor durations require ongoing energy injection and they could,
for example, be powered by interaction or by a continuum-driven wind.
Instabilities during the neon and oxygen burning phases are predicted to launch
precursors in the final years to months before the explosion; however, the
brightest precursor is 100 times more energetic than anticipated.

the intrinsically collisionless CR population is tightly coupled to the thermal
plasma and provides dynamical feedback. Here, we show that CRs with a finite
pitch angle drive electromagnetic waves (along the background magnetic field)
unstable on intermediate scales between the gyro-radii of CR ions and electrons
as long as CRs are drifting with a velocity less than half of the Alfv\'en
speed of electrons. By solving the linear dispersion relation, we show that
this new instability typically grows faster by more than an order of magnitude
in comparison to the commonly discussed resonant instability at the ion
gyroscale. We find the growth rate for this intermediate-scale instability and
identify the growing modes as background ion-cyclotron modes in the frame that
is comoving with the CRs. We confirm the theoretical growth rate with a
particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation and study the non-linear saturation of this
instability. We identify three important astro-physical applications of this
intermediate-scale instability, which is expected to 1. modulate CR transport
and strengthen CR feedback in galaxies and galaxy clusters, 2. enable electron
injection into the diffusive shock acceleration process, and 3. decelerate CR
escape from the sites of particle acceleration which would generate gamma-ray
halos surrounding CR sources such as supernova remnants.

initially-uniform magnetic field in the direction of flow is studied in the
framework of 2D incompressible magnetohydrodynamics with finite resistivity and
viscosity using direct numerical simulations. The shear layer evolves freely,
with no external forcing, and thus broadens in time as turbulent stresses
transport momentum across it. As with KH-unstable flows in hydrodynamics, the
instability here features a conjugate stable mode for every unstable mode in
the absence of dissipation. Stable modes are shown to transport momentum up its
gradient, shrinking the layer width whenever they exceed unstable modes in
amplitude. In simulations with weak magnetic fields, the linear instability is
minimally affected by the magnetic field, but enhanced small-scale fluctuations
relative to the hydrodynamic case are observed. These enhanced fluctuations
coincide with increased energy dissipation and faster layer broadening, with
these features more pronounced in simulations with stronger fields. These
trends result from the magnetic field reducing the effects of stable modes
relative to the transfer of energy to small scales. As field strength
increases, stable modes become less excited and thus transport less momentum
against its gradient. Furthermore, the energy that would otherwise transfer
back to the driving shear due to stable modes is instead allowed to cascade to
small scales, where it is lost to dissipation. Approximations of the turbulent
state in terms of a reduced set of modes are explored. While the Reynolds
stress is well-described using just two modes per wavenumber at large scales,
the Maxwell stress is not.

the inflaton field passes through a tachyonic region and it leads to explosive
particle production through the tachyonic preheating process. After preheating,
the Universe becomes dominated by the kinetic energy of the inflaton and enters
a period of kination. Eventually, the total energy density of the Universe
becomes dominated by radiation, resulting in reheating. We find that the model
predicts the reheating temperature values $T_{\rm{RH}} \sim \mathcal{O}(10^3 -

coronal mass ejection (CME) takes the form of a magnetic flux rope, and a
subset of them have become known as `hot flux ropes' due to their emission
signatures in $\sim$10 MK plasma. Aims: We seek to identify the processes by
which these hot flux ropes form, with a view of developing our understanding of
CMEs and thereby improving space weather forecasts. Methods:
Extreme-ultraviolet observations were used to identify five pre-eruptive hot
flux ropes in the solar corona and study how they evolved. Confined flares were
observed in the hours and days before each flux rope erupted, and these were
used as indicators of episodic bursts of magnetic reconnection by which each
flux rope formed. The evolution of the photospheric magnetic field was observed
during each formation period to identify the process(es) that enabled magnetic
reconnection to occur in the $\beta<1$ corona and form the flux ropes. Results:
The confined flares were found to be homologous events and suggest flux rope
formation times that range from 18 hours to 5 days. Throughout these periods,
fragments of photospheric magnetic flux were observed to orbit around each
other in sunspots where the flux ropes had a footpoint. Active regions with
right-handed (left-handed) twisted magnetic flux exhibited clockwise
(anticlockwise) orbiting motions, and right-handed (left-handed) flux ropes
formed. Conclusions: We infer that the orbital motions of photospheric magnetic
flux fragments about each other bring magnetic flux tubes together in the
corona, enabling component reconnection that forms a magnetic flux rope above a
flaring arcade. This represents a novel trigger mechanism for solar eruptions
and should be considered when predicting solar magnetic activity.

latest cosmic microwave background constraints, we do not find any evidence of

interactions both at the boundary and within the bulk of the particle system.
These variations on open-ASEP are not integrable models, similar to the
long-range variations on ASEP considered in [Dembo-Tsai '15, Y '20]. We
establish the KPZ equation with the appropriate Robin boundary conditions as
scaling limits for height function fluctuations associated to these
non-integrable models, providing further evidence for the aforementioned
universality of the KPZ equation. We specialize to compact domains and address
non-compact domains in a second paper. The procedure that we employ to
establish the aforementioned theorem is the second main point of this paper.
Invariant measures in the presence of boundary interactions generally lack
reasonable descriptions. Thus, global analyses done through the invariant
measure, including the theory of energy solutions in [Goncalves-Jara '14,
Goncalves-Jara '17, Goncalves-Jara-Sethuraman '15], is immediately obstructed.
To circumvent this obstruction, we appeal to the almost entirely local nature
of the analysis in [Y '20].

studies of LSBGs in deep photometric surveys are often hindered by a lack of
distance estimates. In this work, we present a new catalogue of 479 LSBGs,
identified in deep optical imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru
Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). These galaxies are found across a range of
environments, from the field to groups. Many are likely to be ultra-diffuse
galaxies (UDGs). We see clear evidence for a bimodal population in colour -
S\'ersic index space, and split our sample into red and blue LSBG populations.
We estimate environmental densities for a subsample of 215 sources by
statistically associating them with nearby spectroscopic galaxies from the
overlapping GAMA spectroscopic survey. We find that the blue LSBGs are
statistically consistent with being spatially randomised with respect to local
spectroscopic galaxies, implying they exist predominantly in low-density
environments. However, the red LSBG population is significantly spatially
correlated with local structure. We find that 26+/-5% of isolated, local LSBGs
belong to the red population, which we interpret as quiescent. This indicates
that high environmental density plays a dominant, but not exclusive, role in
producing quiescent LSBGs. Our analysis method may prove to be very useful
given the large samples of LSB galaxies without distance information expected
from e.g. the Vera C. Rubin observatory (aka LSST), especially in combination

the centripetal force, compared to gravity, increases toward the break; when

filament breakup is achieved. The timescales and relative roles of gravity to
rotation indicate that the structure is stable, long lived ($\sim$ a few times
6 Myr), and undergoing outside-in evolution. Moreover, this filament has
practically no star formation, a perpendicular Planck plane-of-the-sky (POS)
magnetic field morphology, and POS ""zig-zag"" morphology, which together with
the rotation profile lead to the suggestion that the 3D shape is a corkscrew

models in a multitude of applications, they are known to be highly susceptible
to seemingly small indiscernible perturbations to the input data known as
\emph{adversarial attacks}. A variety of recent adversarial training procedures
have been proposed to remedy this issue. Despite the success of such procedures
at increasing accuracy on adversarially perturbed inputs or \emph{robust
accuracy}, these techniques often reduce accuracy on natural unperturbed inputs
or \emph{standard accuracy}. Complicating matters further, the effect and trend
of adversarial training procedures on standard and robust accuracy is rather
counter intuitive and radically dependent on a variety of factors including the
perceived form of the perturbation during training, size/quality of data, model
overparameterization, etc. In this paper we focus on binary classification
problems where the data is generated according to the mixture of two Gaussians
with general anisotropic covariance matrices and derive a precise
characterization of the standard and robust accuracy for a class of minimax
adversarially trained models. We consider a general norm-based adversarial
model, where the adversary can add perturbations of bounded $\ell_p$ norm to
each input data, for an arbitrary $p\ge 1$. Our comprehensive analysis allows
us to theoretically explain several intriguing empirical phenomena and provide
a precise understanding of the role of different problem parameters on standard
and robust accuracies.

finding shortest (or otherwise optimal) paths in networks, frequently in the

focuses on finding optimal distributions of weights which, for a given
connection topology, maximize some kind of flow or minimize a given cost

analysis of the large-deviation functions of random walks. Specifically, a
study of ensembles of trajectories allows us to find optimal paths, or design
optimal weighted networks, by means of an auxiliary stochastic process (the
generalized Doob transform). In contrast to standard approaches, the paths are
not limited to shortest paths and the weights must not necessarily optimize a
given function. Paths and weights can in fact be tailored to a given statistics
of a time-integrated observable, which may be an activity or current, or local

simulations are required to model the evolution of the merger and post-merger

non-trivial, so that toy models become a very powerful tool. Not only do they
simplify the interpretation of the post-merger dynamics, but also allow to gain
insights into the physics behind it. In this work, we construct a simple toy
model that is capable of reproducing the whole angular momentum evolution of
the post-merger remnant, from the merger to the collapse. We validate the model
against several fully general-relativistic numerical simulations employing a
genetic algorithm, and against additional constraints derived from the spectral
properties of the gravitational radiation. As a result, from the remarkably
close overlap between the model predictions and the reference simulations
within the first milliseconds after the merger, we are able to systematically
shed light on the currently open debate regarding the source of the
low-frequency peaks of the gravitational wave power spectral density.

(HERGs and LERGs) based on their dominant mode of black hole accretion: torque
limited accretion representing feeding from a cold disk, or Bondi representing
advection-dominated accretion from a hot medium. Simba predicts good agreement
with the observed radio luminosity function (RLF) and its evolution, overall as
well as separately for HERGs and LERGs. Quiescent galaxies with AGN-dominated
radio flux dominate the RLF at > $\sim 10^{22-23}$ W Hz$^{-1}$, while star
formation dominates at lower radio powers. Overall, RLAGN have higher black
hole accretion rates and lower star formation rates than non-RLAGN at a given
stellar mass or velocity dispersion, but have similar black hole masses. Simba
predicts a LERG number density of 8.53 Mpc$^{-3}$, $\sim 10\times$ higher than
for HERGs, broadly as observed. While LERGs dominate among most massive
galaxies with the largest black holes and HERGs dominate at high specific star

satisfaction model can be used as an objective function that a conversational
agent continuously optimizes for. While end-to-end deep learning has shown
promising results, having access to a large number of reliable annotated

conversational system, there is a growing number of newly developed skills,
making the traditional data collection, annotation, and modeling process
impractical due to the required annotation costs as well as the turnaround
times. In this paper, we suggest a self-supervised contrastive learning

the TNG100 run of IllustrisTNG project, by comparing them with the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, while taking into account selection bias. Our analysis
focuses on the GV, within stellar mass $\log\,\mathrm{M_\star/M_{\odot}} \simeq
10-11$, selected from the bimodal distribution of galaxies on the D$_n$(4000)
vs stellar mass plane, following Angthopo et al. methodology. Both simulations
match the fraction of AGN in the green-valley. However, they over-produce
quiescent GV galaxies with respect to observations, with IllustrisTNG yielding
a higher fraction of quiescent GV galaxies than EAGLE. In both, GV galaxies
have older luminosity-weighted ages with respect to the SDSS, while a better
match is found for mass-weighted ages. We find EAGLE GV galaxies quench their
star formation early, but undergo later episodes of star formation, matching
observations. In contrast, IllustrisTNG GV galaxies have a more extended SFH,
and quench more effectively at later cosmic times, producing the excess of
quenched galaxies in GV compared with SDSS, based on the 4000$\small{ \mathring
{\mathrm A}}$ break strength. These results suggest the AGN feedback subgrid
physics, more specifically, the threshold halo mass for black hole input and
the black hole seed mass, could be the primary cause of the over-production of
quiescent galaxies found with respect to the observational constraints.

describe the fundamental physics of legged locomotion, and lower level
controllers utilize a learned policy that can bridge the gap between the
idealized, simple model and the complex, full order robot. The high-level
planner can use a model of the environment and be task specific, while the
low-level learned controller can execute a wide range of motions so that it
applies to many different tasks. In this letter we describe this learned
dynamic walking controller and show that a range of walking motions from

motion (as a traditional trajectory tracking controller would) but instead
balance immediate motion tracking with long term stability. The resulting

every field of astrophysics, yet it remains unclear what physical mechanisms
determine it. We present the first runs of the STARFORGE project, using a new
numerical framework to follow the formation of individual stars in giant
molecular clouds (GMCs) using the GIZMO code. Our suite include runs with
increasingly complex physics, starting with isothermal ideal
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and then adding non-isothermal thermodynamics and
protostellar outflows. We show that without protostellar outflows the resulting
stellar masses are an order of magnitude too high, similar to the result in the
base isothermal MHD run. Outflows disrupt the accretion flow around the
protostar, allowing gas to fragment and additional stars to form, thereby
lowering the mean stellar mass to a value similar to that observed. The effect
of jets upon global cloud evolution is most pronounced for lower-mass GMCs and
dense clumps, so while jets can disrupt low-mass clouds, they are unable to
regulate star formation in massive GMCs, as they would turn an order unity
fraction of the mass into stars before unbinding the cloud. Jets are also
unable to stop the runaway accretion of massive stars, which could ultimately
lead to the formation of stars with masses $\mathrm{>500\,M_\odot}$. Although
we find that the mass scale set by jets is insensitive to most cloud parameters
(i.e., surface density, virial parameter), it is strongly dependent on the
momentum loading of the jets (which is poorly constrained by observations) as
well the the temperature of the parent cloud, which predicts slightly larger
IMF variations than observed. We conclude that protostellar jets play a vital
role in setting the mass scale of stars, but additional physics are necessary
to reproduce the observed IMF.

locomotion can dramatically expand the operational domains of robotics.
However, conventional controllers for legged locomotion are based on elaborate
state machines that explicitly trigger the execution of motion primitives and
reflexes. These designs have escalated in complexity while falling short of the
generality and robustness of animal locomotion. Here we present a radically
robust controller for legged locomotion in challenging natural environments. We
present a novel solution to incorporating proprioceptive feedback in locomotion
control and demonstrate remarkable zero-shot generalization from simulation to
natural environments. The controller is trained by reinforcement learning in
simulation. It is based on a neural network that acts on a stream of
proprioceptive signals. The trained controller has taken two generations of
quadrupedal ANYmal robots to a variety of natural environments that are beyond
the reach of prior published work in legged locomotion. The controller retains
its robustness under conditions that have never been encountered during
training: deformable terrain such as mud and snow, dynamic footholds such as
rubble, and overground impediments such as thick vegetation and gushing water.
The presented work opens new frontiers for robotics and indicates that radical
robustness in natural environments can be achieved by training in much simpler
domains.

{\it adaptive} queries. Concretely, given a dataset $X = \{x_i\}_{i = 1}^n$ of
$n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $0 < p \leq 2$, we construct a randomized data
structure with low memory consumption and query time which, when later given
any query point $q \in \mathbb{R}^d$, outputs a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation of
$\lVert q - x_i \rVert_p$ with high probability for all $i\in[n]$. The main
novelty is our data structure's correctness guarantee holds even when the
sequence of queries can be chosen adaptively: an adversary is allowed to choose
the $j$th query point $q_j$ in a way that depends on the answers reported by
the data structure for $q_1,\ldots,q_{j-1}$. Previous randomized Monte Carlo
methods do not provide error guarantees in the setting of adaptively chosen
queries. Our memory consumption is $\tilde O((n+d)d/\epsilon^2)$, slightly more
than the $O(nd)$ required to store $X$ in memory explicitly, but with the
benefit that our time to answer queries is only $\tilde O(\epsilon^{-2}(n +
d))$, much faster than the naive $\Theta(nd)$ time obtained from a linear scan
in the case of $n$ and $d$ very large. Here $\tilde O$ hides
$\log(nd/\epsilon)$ factors. We discuss applications to nearest neighbor search
and nonparametric estimation.
  Our method is simple and likely to be applicable to other domains: we
describe a generic approach for transforming randomized Monte Carlo data
structures which do not support adaptive queries to ones that do, and show that
for the problem at hand, it can be applied to standard nonadaptive solutions to
$\ell_p$ norm estimation with negligible overhead in query time and a factor
$d$ overhead in memory.

calibration is a common practice in speaker verification systems to map output

splitting function at each node of CPT is based on the logical disjunction of a
community of differently weighted probabilistic linear decision-makers, which
also geometrically corresponds to a convex polytope in the covariate space. We

encouraging simpler decision boundaries by shrinking the number of polytope

neural network inference demands a large compute and memory budget. To address
this challenge, neural architecture search (NAS) promises to help design
accurate ML models that meet the tight MCU memory, latency and energy
constraints. A key component of NAS algorithms is their latency/energy model,
i.e., the mapping from a given neural network architecture to its inference
latency/energy on an MCU. In this paper, we observe an intriguing property of
NAS search spaces for MCU model design: on average, model latency varies
linearly with model operation (op) count under a uniform prior over models in
the search space. Exploiting this insight, we employ differentiable NAS (DNAS)
to search for models with low memory usage and low op count, where op count is
treated as a viable proxy to latency. Experimental results validate our
methodology, yielding our MicroNet models, which we deploy on MCUs using
Tensorflow Lite Micro, a standard open-source NN inference runtime widely used
in the TinyML community. MicroNets demonstrate state-of-the-art results for all
three TinyMLperf industry-standard benchmark tasks: visual wake words, audio
keyword spotting, and anomaly detection. Models and training scripts can be

inhomogeneous conformal field theory in 1+1 dimensions. It is based on an exact
correspondence with dynamical systems on the circle that we establish and use
to prove existence of (non)heating phases characterized by the (absence)
presence of fixed or higher-periodic points of coordinate transformations
encoding the time evolution: Heating corresponds to energy and excitations
concentrating exponentially fast at unstable such points while nonheating to
pseudoperiodic motion. We show that the heating rate (serving as the order
parameter for transitions between these two) can have cusps, even within the
overall heating phase, and that there is a rich structure of phase diagrams
with different heating phases distinguishable through kinks in the entanglement
entropy, reminiscent of Lifshitz phase transitions. Our geometric approach
generalizes previous results for a subfamily of similar systems that used only
the $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ algebra to general smooth deformations that require the
full infinite-dimensional Virasoro algebra, and we argue that it has wider
applicability, even beyond conformal field theory.

the application on real systems are their adaptivity to changing environments
and their efficiency w.r.t. computational resources and data. In the
application of learning lane-change behavior for autonomous driving, agents
have to deal with a varying number of surrounding vehicles. Furthermore, the
number of required transitions imposes a bottleneck, since test drivers cannot
perform an arbitrary amount of lane changes in the real world. In the
off-policy setting, additional information on solving the task can be gained by
observing actions from others. While in the classical RL setup this knowledge
remains unused, we use other drivers as surrogates to learn the agent's value
function more efficiently. We propose Surrogate Q-learning that deals with the
aforementioned problems and reduces the required driving time drastically. We
further propose an efficient implementation based on a permutation-equivariant
deep neural network architecture of the Q-function to estimate action-values
for a variable number of vehicles in sensor range. We show that the
architecture leads to a novel replay sampling technique we call Scene-centric
Experience Replay and evaluate the performance of Surrogate Q-learning and
Scene-centric Experience Replay in the open traffic simulator SUMO.
Additionally, we show that our methods enhance real-world applicability of RL

  Attention Network","5 pages, accepted by ICASSP'2021",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anomalous audio in speech recordings is often caused by speaker voice
distortion, external noise, or even electric interferences. These obstacles
have become a serious problem in some fields, such as high-quality music mixing
and speech processing. In this paper, a novel approach using a temporal
convolutional attention network (TCAN) is proposed to tackle this problem. The
use of temporal conventional network (TCN) can capture long range patterns
using a hierarchy of temporal convolutional filters. To enhance the ability to
tackle audio anomalies in different acoustic conditions, an attention mechanism
is used in TCN, where a self-attention block is added after each temporal
convolutional layer. This aims to highlight the target related features and
mitigate the interferences from irrelevant information. To evaluate the
performance of the proposed model, audio recordings are collected from the
TIMIT dataset, and are then changed by adding five different types of audio
distortions: gaussian noise, magnitude drift, random dropout, reduction of
temporal resolution, and time warping. Distortions are mixed at different
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) (5dB, 10dB, 15dB, 20dB, 25dB, 30dB). The
experimental results show that the use of proposed model can yield better
classification performances than some strong baseline methods, such as the LSTM

the eight-dimensional parameter space of $w_0w_a$CDM$+\sum m_\nu$models between
redshift $z=0$ and $z=3$ for spatial scales within the range 0.01 $h$/Mpc $\leq
k \leq$ 10 $h$/Mpc. In order to achieve this level of accuracy, we have had to
improve the quality of the underlying N-body simulations used as training data:
(1) we use self-consistent linear evolution of non-dark matter species such as
massive neutrinos, photons, dark energy and the metric field, (2) we perform
the simulations in the so-called N-body gauge, which allows one to interpret
the results in the framework of general relativity, (3) we run over 250
high-resolution simulations with $3000^3$ particles in boxes of 1
(Gpc/$h$)${}^3$ volumes based on paired-and-fixed initial conditions and (4) we
provide a resolution correction that can be applied to emulated results as a
post-processing step in order to drastically reduce systematic biases on small
scales due to residual resolution effects in the simulations. We find that the
inclusion of the dynamical dark energy parameter $w_a$ significantly increases
the complexity and expense of creating the emulator. The high fidelity of
EuclidEmulator2 is tested in various comparisons against N-body simulations as
well as alternative fast predictors like Halofit, HMCode and CosmicEmu. A blind
test is successfully performed against the Euclid Flagship v2.0 simulation.
Nonlinear correction factors emulated with EuclidEmulator2 are accurate at the
level of 1% or better for 0.01 $h$/Mpc $\leq k \leq$ 10 $h$/Mpc and $z\leq3$
compared to high-resolution dark matter only simulations. EuclidEmulator2 is

Here, we propose a reference architecture to bridge the gap between computer

graph signal filtering with deep feature learning into a competitive hybrid
design -- one that utilizes interpretable analytical low-pass graph filters and
employs 80% fewer network parameters than state-of-the-art DL denoising scheme
DnCNN. Specifically, to construct a suitable similarity graph for graph
spectral filtering, we first adopt a CNN to learn feature representations per

constructed graph, we next formulate a convex optimization problem for
denoising using a graph total variation (GTV) prior. Via a $l_1$ graph
Laplacian reformulation, we interpret its solution in an iterative procedure as
a graph low-pass filter and derive its frequency response. For fast filter
implementation, we realize this response using a Lanczos approximation.
Experimental results show that in the case of statistical mistmatch, our

profound insights into emergent correlations and phase transitions of
geometrically-frustrated Ising spin systems. Their temporal and spatial
evolution are often simulated using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, which rely
on the precise knowledge of the switching barriers to obtain predictive results
in agreement with experimental observations. In many cases, however, the
barriers are derived from simplified assumptions only, and do not take into
account the full physical picture of nanomagnetic switching. Here we describe
how the immediate magnetic environment of a nanomagnet reversing via
quasi-coherent rotation can induce clockwise and counter-clockwise switching
channels with different barrier energies. This barrier splitting for chiral
reversal channels can be sizeable and, as string-method micromagnetic
simulations show, is relevant for artificial spin ice systems made of both
exchange -- as well as magnetostatically --dominated units. Due to the barrier
splitting (and further reductions due to non-uniform reversal) transition rates
can be exponentially enhanced by several orders of magnitude compared to
mean-field predictions, especially in the limit of rare switching events where
thermal excitation is less likely. This leads to significantly faster
relaxation time scales and modified spatial correlations. Our findings are thus
of integral importance to achieve realistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of
emergent correlations in artificial spin systems, magnonic crystals, or the

We consider a setting in which communication between nodes is hindered by both
(i) a finite rate-constraint on the signal transmitted by any node, and (ii)
additive noise corrupting the signal received by any node. We propose a novel
algorithm for this scenario: Decentralized Lazy Mirror Descent with
Differential Exchanges (DLMD-DiffEx), which guarantees convergence of the local
estimates to the optimal solution under the given communication constraints. A
salient feature of DLMD-DiffEx is the introduction of additional proxy
variables that are maintained by the nodes to account for the disagreement in
their estimates due to channel noise and rate-constraints. Convergence to the
optimal solution is attained by having nodes iteratively exchange these
disagreement terms until consensus is achieved. In order to prevent noise
accumulation during this exchange, DLMD-DiffEx relies on two sequences; one
controlling the power of the transmitted signal, and the other determining the
consensus rate. We provide clear insights on the design of these two sequences
which highlights the interplay between consensus rate and noise amplification.
We investigate the performance of DLMD-DiffEx both from a theoretical

the neutral position of the microrobot. Equipped with rockers to contact the
substrate, the microrobot, hence microrocker bot, is capable of well-controlled
forward and backward movement on flat and non-flat biological surfaces. The
100um by 113um by 36um robots were 3D printed via two-photon lithography and
subsequently deposited with nickel thin films. Under a relatively small static

the thin film magnetization direction with the magnetic field lines. When
combined with an oscillating magnetic field, the robot undergoes stick-slip
motion in the predisposed direction, dictated by the neutral position tilt. The
microrocker bots are further equipped with sharp mechanical tips that can be
selectively engaged. When the frequency and offset of the actuation sawtooth
waveform are optimized, the robot travels up to 100um/s (1 body length per

prove the functionality of the microrocker bots in direct contact with

(ii) after converting Fourier to Fresnel holograms, (iii) after rendering, on
the quantized amplitude of the reconstructed data, and (iv) after subsequently
removing speckle noise using a Wiener filter. For every experimental track, the
quality metric predictions are compared to the Mean Opinion Scores (MOS)
gathered on a 2D screen, light field display and a holographic display.
Additionally, a statistical analysis of the results and a discussion on the

valuable information from different perspectives. While data-driven
applications improve countless products, training models for hyperparameter

computing provides infrastructure support for the training of deep learning
applications. The cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services [3],
create an isolated virtual environment (virtual machines and containers) for
clients, who share physical resources, e.g., CPU and memory. On the cloud,
resource management schemes are implemented to enable better sharing among
users and boost the system-wide performance. However, general scheduling
approaches, such as spread priority and balanced resource schedulers, do not
work well with deep learning workloads. In this project, we propose SpeCon, a
novel container scheduler that is optimized for shortlived deep learning

Docker [5], SpeCon analyzes the common characteristics of training processes.
We design a suite of algorithms to monitor the progress of the training and
speculatively migrate the slow-growing models to release resources for
fast-growing ones. Specifically, the extensive experiments demonstrate that
SpeCon improves the completion time of an individual job by up to 41.5%, 14.8%

acoustic modes in rapidly rotating stars follow an asymptotic formula and
recent observations of pulsations in rapidly rotating delta Scuti stars seem to
match these expectations. However, a key question is whether strong gradients
or discontinuities can adversely affect this pattern to the point of hindering
its identification. Other important questions are how rotational splittings are
affected by the 2D rotation profiles expected from baroclinic effects and
whether it is possible to probe the rotation profile using these splittings.
Accordingly, we numerically calculate pulsation modes in continuous and
discontinuous rapidly rotating models produced by the 2D ESTER (Evolution
STEllaire en Rotation) code. This spectral multi-domain code self-consistently
calculates the rotation profile based on baroclinic effects and allows us to
introduce discontinuities without loss of numerical accuracy. Pulsations are
calculated using an adiabatic version of the Two-dimensional Oscillation
Program (TOP) code. The variational principle is used to confirm the high
accuracy of the pulsation frequencies and to derive an integral formula that
closely matches the generalised rotational splittings, except when modes are
involved in avoided crossings. This potentially allows us to probe the the
rotation profile using inverse theory. Acoustic glitch theory, applied along
the island mode orbit deduced from ray dynamics, can correctly predict the
periodicity of the glitch frequency pattern produced by a discontinuity or the
Gamma1 dip related to the He II ionisation zone in some of the models. The
asymptotic frequency pattern remains sufficiently well preserved to potentially
allow its detection in observed stars.

robotic applications, but its performance is immensely dependent on the quality
of the samples. The majority of traditional planners are inefficient as they
use uninformative sampling distributions as opposed to exploiting structures
and patterns in the problem to guide better sampling strategies. Moreover, most
current learning-based planners are susceptible to posterior collapse or mode
collapse due to the sparsity and highly varying nature of C-Space and motion
plan configurations. In this work, we introduce a conditional normalising flow
based distribution learned through previous experiences to improve sampling of
these methods. Our distribution can be conditioned on the current problem
instance to provide an informative prior for sampling configurations within
promising regions. When we train our sampler with an expert planner, the
resulting distribution is often near-optimal, and the planner can find a
solution faster, with less invalid samples, and less initial cost. The
normalising flow based distribution uses simple invertible transformations that
are very computationally efficient, and our optimisation formulation explicitly
avoids mode collapse in contrast to other existing learning-based planners.
Finally, we provide a formulation and theoretical foundation to efficiently
sample from the distribution; and demonstrate experimentally that, by using our
normalising flow based distribution, a solution can be found faster, with less

logical or mathematical constraints as a means of data augmentation as well as
to compute loss (in conjunction with the traditional MSE), with the aim of
increasing both data efficiency and accuracy of symbolic regression (SR)

set of labelled data points and auxiliary truths (ATs) (mathematical facts
known a priori about the unknown function the regressor aims to learn) and
outputs a specially generated and curated dataset that can be used with any SR
method. Three key insights underpin our method: first, SR users often know
simple ATs about the function they are trying to learn. Second, whenever an SR
system produces a candidate equation inconsistent with these ATs, we can
compute a counterexample to prove the inconsistency, and further, this
counterexample may be used to augment the dataset and fed back to the SR system
in a corrective feedback loop. Third, the value addition of these ATs is that
their use in both the loss function and the data augmentation process leads to
better rates of convergence, accuracy, and data efficiency. We evaluate LGGA
against state-of-the-art SR tools, namely, Eureqa and TuringBot on 16 physics
equations from ""The Feynman Lectures on Physics"" book. We find that using these
SR tools in conjunction with LGGA results in them solving up to 30.0% more
equations, needing only a fraction of the amount of data compared to the same
tool without LGGA, i.e., resulting in up to a 61.9% improvement in data
efficiency.

computational load, most previous studies focus on applying LSTM-LMs in the
second-pass for rescoring purpose. Recent work shows that it is feasible and
computationally affordable to adopt the LSTM-LMs in the first-pass decoding
within a dynamic (or tree based) decoder framework. In this work, the LSTM-LM
is composed with a WFST decoder on-the-fly for the first-pass decoding.
Furthermore, motivated by the long-term history nature of LSTM-LMs, the use of
context beyond the current utterance is explored for the first-pass decoding in
conversational speech recognition. The context information is captured by the
hidden states of LSTM-LMs across utterance and can be used to guide the
first-pass search effectively. The experimental results in our internal meeting

obtained by incorporating the contextual information with LSTM-LMs in the
first-pass decoding, compared to applying the contextual information in the

to the unit interval, such as proportions, fractions, and rates. The inference
for the parameters of beta regression models is commonly based on maximum
likelihood estimation. However, it is known to be sensitive to discrepant
observations. In some cases, one atypical data point can lead to severe bias
and erroneous conclusions about the features of interest. In this work, we
develop a robust estimation procedure for beta regression models based on the
maximization of a reparameterized Lq-likelihood. The new estimator offers a
trade-off between robustness and efficiency through a tuning constant. To
select the optimal value of the tuning constant, we propose a data-driven
method which ensures full efficiency in the absence of outliers. We also
improve on an alternative robust estimator by applying our data-driven method
to select its optimum tuning constant. Monte Carlo simulations suggest marked
robustness of the two robust estimators with little loss of efficiency.
Applications to three datasets are presented and discussed. As a by-product of

of samples from classes which were unseen at training time. This is achieved by
leveraging side information about class labels, such as label attributes or
word embeddings. Recently, attention has shifted to the more realistic task of
generalized ZSL (GZSL) where test sets consist of seen and unseen samples.
Recent approaches to GZSL have shown the value of generative models, which are
used to generate samples from unseen classes. In this work, we incorporate an
additional source of side information in the form of a relation graph over
labels. We leverage this graph in order to learn a set of prior distributions,
which encourage an aligned variational autoencoder (VAE) model to learn
embeddings which respect the graph structure. Using this approach we are able
to achieve improved performance on the CUB and SUN benchmarks over a strong
baseline.

response to the outside world. Although most empirical studies have been
dominated by two theoretical models including discrete categories of emotion
and dichotomous dimensions, results from neuroscience approaches suggest a
multi-processes mechanism underpinning emotional experience with a large
overlap across different emotions. While these findings are consistent with the
influential theories of emotion in psychology that emphasize a role for
multiple component processes to generate emotion episodes, few studies have
systematically investigated the relationship between discrete emotions and a
full componential view. This paper applies a componential framework with a
data-driven approach to characterize emotional experiences evoked during movie
watching. The results suggest that differences between various emotions can be
captured by a few (at least 6) latent dimensions, each defined by features
associated with component processes, including appraisal, expression,
physiology, motivation, and feeling. In addition, the link between discrete
emotions and component model is explored and results show that a componential
model with a limited number of descriptors is still able to predict the level
of experienced discrete emotion(s) to a satisfactory level. Finally, as
appraisals may vary according to individual dispositions and biases, we also
study the relationship between personality traits and emotions in our
computational framework and show that the role of personality on discrete
emotion differences can be better justified using the component model.

Signed Distance Functions (SDFs) and Occupany Functions are adopted in

representation. This paper proposes a novel method for learning occupancy
functions from sparse point clouds and achieves better performance on
challenging surface reconstruction tasks. Unlike the previous methods, which
predict point occupancy with fully-connected multi-layer networks, we adapt the
point cloud deep learning architecture, Point Convolution Neural Network
(PCNN), to build our learning model. Specifically, we create a sampling
operator and insert it into PCNN to continuously sample the feature space at
the points where occupancy states need to be predicted. This method natively
obtains point cloud data's geometric nature, and it's invariant to point
permutation. Our occupancy function learning can be easily fit into procedures
of point cloud up-sampling and surface reconstruction. Our experiments show
state-of-the-art performance for reconstructing With ShapeNet dataset and
demonstrate this method's well-generalization by testing it with McGill 3D
dataset \cite{siddiqi2008retrieving}. Moreover, we find the learned occupancy
function is relatively more rotation invariant than previous shape learning
methods.

strengthened by integrating AMP and belief propagation on the outer code

value on unknown inputs for minimum cost.
  Prior works on this problem have focused on specific classes of functions. We
analyze a simple and natural strategy that applies to all functions $f$, and
show that its performance relative to the optimal strategy can be expressed in
terms of a basic complexity measure of $f$, its influence. For $\varepsilon \in
(0,\frac1{2})$, writing $\mathsf{opt}$ to denote the expected cost of the
optimal strategy that errs on at most an $\varepsilon$-fraction of inputs, our
strategy has expected cost $\mathsf{opt} \cdot \mathrm{Inf}(f)/\varepsilon^2$
and also errs on at most an $O(\varepsilon)$-fraction of inputs. This
connection yields new guarantees that complement existing ones for a number of
function classes that have been studied in this context, as well as new
guarantees for new classes.

channel's measurements are given as convolution of a common source signal and
sparse filter. Unlike prior works where the compression is achieved either
through random projections or by applying a fixed structured compression
matrix, this paper proposes to learn the compression matrix from data. Given
the full measurements, the proposed network is trained in an unsupervised
fashion to learn the source and estimate sparse filters. Then, given the
estimated source, we learn a structured compression operator while optimizing
for signal reconstruction and sparse filter recovery. The efficient structure
of the compression allows its practical hardware implementation. The proposed
neural network is an autoencoder constructed based on an unfolding approach:
upon training, the encoder maps the compressed measurements into an estimate of
sparse filters using the compression operator and the source, and the linear
convolutional decoder reconstructs the full measurements. We demonstrate that
our method is superior to classical structured compressive sparse multichannel
blind-deconvolution methods in terms of accuracy and speed of sparse filter
recovery.

exploration of parameter space, although not exhaustive, is guided and
restricted by observations and we find that the higher the multiplicity of the
planetary system, the more likely it is to have a dynamical instability (losing
planets, orbit crossing and scattering), that eventually will send a planet (or
small object) through a close periastron passage. Indeed, the fraction of
unstable four- to six-planet simulations is comparable to the 25-50$\%$
fraction of WDs having atmospheric pollution. Additionally, the onset of
instability in the four- to six-planet configurations peaks in the first Gyr of

psychological mechanisms. We propose here to use a recurrent neural network

the first application of such methods in this research domain. In this study,
we collate the human data from 8 published literature of the Iterated
Prisoner's Dilemma comprising 168,386 individual decisions and post-process
them into 8,257 behavioral trajectories of 9 actions each for both players.
Similarly, we collate 617 trajectories of 95 actions from 10 different
published studies of Iowa Gambling Task experiments with healthy human
subjects. We train our prediction networks on the behavioral data and
demonstrate a clear advantage over the state-of-the-art methods in predicting
human decision-making trajectories in both the single-agent scenario of the
Iowa Gambling Task and the multi-agent scenario of the Iterated Prisoner's

performers, as well as a larger bias, which suggest possible interpretations
for the distribution of strategies adopted by each group.

detect the discrepancy between natural and adversarial data. Given this
phenomenon, we raise a question: are natural and adversarial data really from
different distributions? The answer is affirmative -- the previous use of the
MMD test on the purpose missed three key factors, and accordingly, we propose
three components. Firstly, the Gaussian kernel has limited representation
power, and we replace it with an effective deep kernel. Secondly, the test
power of the MMD test was neglected, and we maximize it following asymptotic
statistics. Finally, adversarial data may be non-independent, and we overcome
this issue with the wild bootstrap. By taking care of the three factors, we
verify that the MMD test is aware of adversarial attacks, which lights up a
novel road for adversarial data detection based on two-sample tests.

items to the current basket. Existing methods solve this problem by assuming
the items within the same basket are correlated by one semantic relation, thus
optimizing the item embeddings. However, this assumption breaks when there
exist multiple intents within a basket. For example, assuming a basket contains
\{\textit{bread, cereal, yogurt, soap, detergent}\} where \{\textit{bread,
cereal, yogurt}\} are correlated through the ""breakfast"" intent, while
\{\textit{soap, detergent}\} are of ""cleaning"" intent, ignoring multiple
relations among the items spoils the ability of the model to learn the
embeddings. To resolve this issue, it is required to discover the intents
within the basket. However, retrieving a multi-intent pattern is rather
challenging, as intents are latent within the basket. Additionally, intents
within the basket may also be correlated. Moreover, discovering a multi-intent
pattern requires modeling high-order interactions, as the intents across
different baskets are also correlated. To this end, we propose a new framework

as tail entities translated from one corresponding basket embedding via $T$
relation vectors. The relation vectors are learned through multi-head
aggregators to handle user and item information. Additionally, MITGNN
propagates multiple intents across our defined basket graph to learn the
embeddings of users and items by aggregating neighbors. Extensive experiments

both transductive and inductive BR. The code is available online at

on a novel algorithmic framework of simultaneously constructing two candidate

performance bounds by fully exploiting the properties of independence systems.
As a byproduct of this framework, we also show that TwinGreedyFast achieves
$\frac{1}{2p+2}-\epsilon$ deterministic ratio under a $p$-set system constraint

training, the cortical surface at a desired level of detail is obtained by
evaluating surface representations at specific coordinates, and subsequently
applying a topology correction algorithm and an isosurface extraction method.
Thanks to the continuous nature of this approach and the efficacy of its

magnetization textures in the two-dimensional (2D) magnets. The recent
discovery of 2D magnetic topological insulators such as MnBi2Te4 leads to the
interesting possibility to explore the interplay of such magnetization textures
with the topological surface states, which we explore here with a minimal model
established for 2D MnBi2Te4. The sign flip of the exchange gap across a
magnetization domain wall gives rise to a single in-gap chiral channel on each
surface. In the periodic magnetization textures, such chiral spin channels at
the domain walls couple to form a network and superlattice minibands emerge. We
find that in magnetization textures with closed domain wall geometries, the
formed superlattice miniband is a gapped Dirac cone featuring orbital
magnetization from the current circulation in the close loops of chiral
channels, while in magnetization textures with open domain wall geometries,
gapless mini-Dirac cone is found instead. The miniband Bloch states feature a
spatial texture of spin and local current density, which are clear
manifestation of the spin-momentum locked chiral channels at the domain walls.

absorption lines in the rest-frame wavelength range of $\sim 1600-2600$ \AA. We
find that the comoving line density ($dN/dX$) of the strong Fe II-bearing Mg II
absorbers decreases towards higher redshift at $z>3$, consistent with previous
studies. Compared with strong Mg II absorbers detected in damped Ly$\alpha$
systems at 2 $<z<$ 4, our absorbers are potentially less saturated and show
much larger rest-frame velocity widths. This suggests that the gas traced by
our absorbers are potentially affected by galactic superwinds. We analyze the
{\it Hubble Space Telescope} near-IR images of the quasars and identify
possible associated galaxies for our strong absorbers. There are a maximum of
two galaxy candidates found within 5"" radius of each absorber. The median
F105W-band magnitude of these galaxy candidates is 24.8 mag, which is fainter
than the $L^*$ galaxy luminosity at $z\sim$ 4. By using our observed $dN/dX$ of
strong Mg II absorbers and galaxy candidates median luminosity, we suggest that
at high redshift, strong Mg II absorbers tend to have a more disturbed
environment but smaller halo size than that at $z <$ 1.

the photometry of S-stars can be used for studying the properties of gaseous
environment of Sgr A$^*$. Due to the high velocities of the S-stars, sometimes
approaching $~0.1c$, their photometric signal should be considerably affected
by the Doppler boosting. We calculate this relativistic effect for several
S-stars closely approaching the central black hole (most of them recently
announced) and show that the amplitude of the photometric variability due to
the Doppler boosting for some of them (S62 and S4714) exceeds $6\%$; for the
well studied star S2 it is about $2\%$. Measurement of the Doppler boosting can
confirm the existence and help refine orbital parameters of the S-stars with
noisy spectroscopy and astrometry. This effect should be explicitly accounted
for when the photometry of S-stars is used for probing the medium around the
Sgr A$^*$. We discuss the observability of the Doppler boosting given the
complications typical for the Galactic Center and conclude, in particular, that
the purely photometric detection of the higher order relativistic corrections

to unstable or imprecise terahertz spectra. By deriving a simplified but
universal form of plasmon frequencies, here we reveal a unified mechanism for
generating unusual n-independent plasmons (DIPs) in all topological states with
different dimensions. Remarkably, we predict that terahertz DIPs can be excited
in 2D nodal-line and 1D nodal-point systems, confirmed by the first-principles
calculations on almost all existing topological semimetals with diverse lattice

degeneracy-factor dependences in DIPs can be applied to design topological
superlattice and multi-walled carbon nanotube metamaterials for broadband
terahertz spectroscopy and quantized terahertz plasmons, respectively.
Surprisingly, high spatial confinement and quality factor, also insensitive to

optimization, these appear naturally, as hundreds or more optimization steps

so does the finite element mesh, especially if re-meshing is needed. As a
result, the number of algebraic degrees of freedom in the system may change

the matrices. In the case of remeshing, even if the geometry changes only a
little, the corresponding mesh might differ substantially from the previous

However, minimal commonality sometimes discards the ""strength"" of connections
and interactions among groups. To this end, considering the ""width"" of a
connection, referred to as the $s$-overlap of neighbors, provides more
meaningful insights into how closely the communities or entities interact with
each other. In addition, $s$-overlap computation is the fundamental kernel to
construct the line graph of a hypergraph, a low-order approximation of the
hypergraph which can carry significant information about the original
hypergraph. Subsequent stages of a data analytics pipeline then can apply
highly-tuned graph algorithms on the line graph to reveal important features.
Given a hypergraph, computing the $s$-overlaps by exhaustively considering all

we develop efficient algorithms to compute $s$-overlaps and the corresponding

detector first employs ML algorithms for aggregate traffic classification and
subsequently Autocorrelation Function (ACF)-based tests to detect individual
bots. The EDIMA architecture also comprises a malware traffic database, a

results show that EDIMA achieves high bot scanning and bot-CnC traffic
detection accuracies with very low false positive rates. The detection
performance is also shown to be robust to an increase in the number of IoT
devices connected to the edge gateway where EDIMA is deployed. Further, the

recorded outburst of the Symbiotic Recurrent Nova, V3890 Sgr. The first
observing run, 8.1-9.9 days after the outburst, initially showed a stable
intensity level with a hard X-ray spectrum that we attribute to shocks between
the nova ejecta and the pre-existing stellar companion. On day 8.57, the first,
weak, signs appeared of Super Soft Source (SSS) emission powered by residual
burning on the surface of the White Dwarf. The SSS emission was observed to be
highly variable on time scales of hours. After day 8.9, the SSS component was
more stable and brighter. In the second observing run, on days 15.9-19.6 after
the outburst, the SSS component was even brighter but still highly variable.
The SSS emission was observed to fade significantly during days 16.8-17.8
followed by re-brightening. Meanwhile the shock component was stable leading to
increase in hardness ratio during the period of fading. AstroSat and XMM-Newton
observations have been used to study the spectral properties of V3890 Sgr to
draw quantitative conclusions even if their drawback is model-dependence. We
used the xspec to fit spectral models of plasma emission, and the best fits are
consistent with the elemental abundances being lower during the second
observing run compared to the first for spectra >1 keV. The SSS emission is
well fit by non-local thermal equilibrium model atmosphere used for white
dwarfs. The resulting spectral parameters, however, are subject to systematic
uncertainties such as completeness of atomic data.

  We derive a variety of results on this problem. First, we show that the

to the recoverability parameter $k'=n-k$. This hardness result holds even in
the highly restricted special case where both cost functions $c_1$ and $c_2$

randomized parallel complexity class $\text{RNC}_2$, and that it is at least as

element. We only use data as a method of supervision, bypassing the need of
labels needed to act as a supervision for training the deep neural networks. We
then use a linear classifier head in order to evaluate the performance of our
models, for both self supervised contrastive and generative transformer based

complex multi-hop logical reasoning over the facts captured by a knowledge
graph (KG). This problem is challenging, because KGs can be massive and
incomplete. Recent approaches embed KG entities in a low dimensional space and
then use these embeddings to find the answer entities. However, it has been an
outstanding challenge of how to handle arbitrary first-order logic (FOL)
queries as present methods are limited to only a subset of FOL operators. In
particular, the negation operator is not supported. An additional limitation of
present methods is also that they cannot naturally model uncertainty. Here, we
present BetaE, a probabilistic embedding framework for answering arbitrary FOL
queries over KGs. BetaE is the first method that can handle a complete set of
first-order logical operations: conjunction ($\wedge$), disjunction ($\vee$),
and negation ($\neg$). A key insight of BetaE is to use probabilistic
distributions with bounded support, specifically the Beta distribution, and
embed queries/entities as distributions, which as a consequence allows us to
also faithfully model uncertainty. Logical operations are performed in the
embedding space by neural operators over the probabilistic embeddings. We
demonstrate the performance of BetaE on answering arbitrary FOL queries on
three large, incomplete KGs. While being more general, BetaE also increases
relative performance by up to 25.4% over the current state-of-the-art KG
reasoning methods that can only handle conjunctive queries without negation.

way, there are few works addressing it. While, our experiments demonstrate
that, with a concise CNN, we could get a meaningful parametric model that could
reconstruct the correct scenery images only from the 6-DoF pose. To this end,
we propose a two-stage learning strategy, which consists of two consecutive
CNNs: GenNet and RefineNet. GenNet generates a coarse image from a camera pose.
RefineNet is a generative adversarial network that refines the coarse image. In
this way, we decouple the geometric relationship between mapping and texture

the effectiveness of our method. We believe this paradigm is of high research

mean and independent components, the twin problems of change-point detection

times where the mean varies and estimating the positions of those
change-points. In this work, we tightly characterize optimal rates for both
problems and uncover the phase transition phenomenon from a global testing
problem to a local estimation problem. Introducing a suitable definition of the
energy of a change-point, we first establish in the single change-point setting
that the optimal detection threshold is $\sqrt{2\log\log(n)}$. When the energy
is just above the detection threshold, then the problem of localizing the
change-point becomes purely parametric: it only depends on the difference in
means and not on the position of the change-point anymore. Interestingly, for
most change-point positions, it is possible to detect and localize them at a
much smaller energy level. In the multiple change-point setting, we establish
the energy detection threshold and show similarly that the optimal localization
error of a specific change-point becomes purely parametric. Along the way,
tight optimal rates for Hausdorff and $l_1$ estimation losses of the vector of
all change-points positions are also established. Two procedures achieving
these optimal rates are introduced. The first one is a least-squares estimator

successfully realized the goal of studying bond dissociation in a numerically

and analyse the UGA-SSMRPT2 theory in the description of avoided crossings and
interlacing between a manifold of states belonging to the same space-spin
symmetry. In a state-specific formalism, since each state is an eigenstate of
its own effective operator, to include the information of the other states
requires the theory to be sufficiently accurate. Three different aspects of
UGA-SSMRPT2 have been studied: (a) We introduce and develop the most rigorous
version of UGA-SSMRPT2 which emerges from the rigorous version of UGA-SSMRCC
utilizing a linearly independent virtual manifold; we call this the
'projection' version of UGA-SSMRPT2 denoted as UGA-SSMRPT2 Scheme P. We compare
and contrast this approach with our earlier formulation that used extra
sufficiency conditions via amplitude equations, which we will denote as
UGA-SSMRPT2 Scheme A. (b) We present the results for a variety of electronic
states of a set of molecules which display the striking accuracy of both the
two versions of UGA-SSMRPT2; with respect to three different situations
involving weakly avoided crossings, moderate/strongly avoided crossings and
interlacing in a manifold of PECs of same symmetry. Accuracy of our results has
been benchmarked against IC-MRCISD+Q. (c) For weakly avoided crossing between
states displaying differently charged sectors in the asymptotes, the
insufficient inclusion of state-specific orbital relaxation in a second order
perturbative theory might lead to an artefact of double crossing between the
pair of PECs.

intrusive and labor intensive to conduct, trail-camera imaging is a
comparatively non-intrusive method for capturing wildlife activity. However,
given the large volume of images produced from trail-cameras, manual analysis
of the images remains time-consuming and inefficient. We implemented a
two-stage deep convolutional neural network pipeline to find animal-containing
images in the first stage and then process these images to detect birds in the
second stage. The animal classification system classifies animal images with
overall 93% sensitivity and 96% specificity. The bird detection system achieves
better than 93% sensitivity, 92% specificity, and 68% average
Intersection-over-Union rate. The entire pipeline processes an image in less
than 0.5 seconds as opposed to an average 30 seconds for a human labeler. We
also addressed post-deployment issues related to data drift for the animal
classification system as image features vary with seasonal changes. This system
utilizes an automatic retraining algorithm to detect data drift and update the
system. We introduce a novel technique for detecting drifted images and
triggering the retraining procedure. Two statistical experiments are also
presented to explain the prediction behavior of the animal classification
system. These experiments investigate the cues that steers the system towards a
particular decision. Statistical hypothesis testing demonstrates that the
presence of an animal in the input image significantly contributes to the
system's decisions.

through a broad maximum between the years 1975 and 1982. This period also
corresponds to a maximum in productivity of the Shane 3 m telescope. An author
network shows that this period is attended by the introduction of digital
detector systems at LO, particularly at the Shane telescope. Following 1983 the
overall productivity of LO shows a net long-term decrease but with two other
lesser peaks superimposed on that decrease. A slightly smaller peak occurs
around 1996 and is associated with programs taking advantage of CCD

(Log-GPIS), a novel continuous and probabilistic mapping representation
suitable for surface reconstruction and local navigation. Our key contribution
is the realisation that the regularised Eikonal equation can be simply solved
by applying the logarithmic transformation to a GPIS formulation to recover the
accurate Euclidean distance field (EDF) and, at the same time, the implicit
surface. To derive the proposed representation, Varadhan's formula is exploited
to approximate the non-linear Eikonal partial differential equation (PDE) of
the EDF by the logarithm of a linear PDE. We show that members of the Matern
covariance family directly satisfy this linear PDE. The proposed approach does
not require post-processing steps to recover the EDF. Moreover, unlike
sampling-based methods, Log-GPIS does not use sample points inside and outside
the surface as the derivative of the covariance allow direct estimation of the
surface normals and distance gradients. We benchmarked the proposed method on
simulated and real data against state-of-the-art mapping frameworks that also
aim at recovering both the surface and a distance field. Our experiments show
that Log-GPIS produces the most accurate results for the EDF and comparable

golden-rule limit, which accurately captures the effects of tunnelling and
zero-point energy. The method is based on a modification of the recently
proposed golden-rule quantum transition state theory (GR-QTST) of Thapa, Fang
and Richardson. While GR-QTST is not size consistent, leading to the
possibility of unbounded errors in the rate, our modified method has no such
issue and so can be reliably applied to condensed phase systems. Both methods
involve path-integral sampling in a constrained ensemble; the two methods
differ, however, in the choice of constraint functional. We demonstrate
numerically that our modified method is as accurate as GR-QTST for the
one-dimensional model considered by Thapa and coworkers. We then study a
multi-dimensional spin-boson model, for which our method accurately predicts
the true quantum rate, while GR-QTST breaks down with an increasing number of
boson modes in the discretisation of the spectral density. Our method is able
to accurately predict reaction rates in the Marcus inverted regime, without the
need for the analytic continuation required by Wolynes theory.

SnS$_2$ via a periodic lattice distortion as found recently in the case of
SnSe$_2$, and that this pressure-induced phase transition is due to the
combined effect of Fermi surface nesting and electron-phonon coupling at a
momentum wave vector $\mathbf{q}$ = $(1/3, 1/3, 0)$. In addition, we
investigate the contribution of nonadiabatic corrections on the calculated
phonon frequencies, and show that the quantitative agreement between theory and

effects are taken into account. Finally, we examine the nature of the
superconducting state recently observed in SnSe$_2$ under nonhydrostatic

in order to address recent suggestions that nuclear tunnelling can lead to
significant deviation from the linear response assumption inherent in the
Marcus picture of electron transfer. A recent study of this reaction by
Richardson and coworkers has found a large difference between their new
path-integral method, GR-QTST, and the saddle point approximation of Wolynes
(Wolynes theory). They suggested that this difference could be attributed to
the existence of multiple tunnelling pathways, leading Wolynes theory to
significantly overestimate the rate. This was used to argue that the linear
response assumptions of Marcus theory may break down for liquid systems when
tunnelling is important. If true, this would imply that the commonly used
method for studying such systems, where the problem is mapped onto a spin-boson
model, is invalid. However, we have recently shown that size inconsistency in
GR-QTST can lead to poor predictions of the rate in systems with many degrees
of freedom. We have also suggested an improved method, the path-integral linear
golden-rule (LGR) approximation, which fixes this problem. Here we demonstrate
that the GR-QTST results for ferrous-ferric electron transfer are indeed
dominated by its size consistency error. Furthermore, by comparing the LGR and
Wolynes theory results, we confirm the established picture of nuclear
tunnelling in this system. Finally, by comparing our path-integral results to
those obtained by mapping onto the spin-boson model, we reassess the importance
of anharmonic effects and the accuracy of this commonly used mapping approach.

of time-independent or static noise in the gates, with no correlations or

gains a competitive advantage by training over a variety of 3D registration

Specifically, the proposed 3D Meta-Registration model consists of two modules:
3D registration learner and 3D registration meta-learner. During the training,
the 3D registration learner is trained to complete a specific registration task
aiming to determine the desired geometric transformation that aligns the source

meta-learner is trained to provide the optimal parameters to update the 3D

prefactor. Not only do 2D numerical simulations confirm the analytical solution
for the sinusoidal source, but, more surprisingly, they indicate that it is

isothermal entropy and adiabatic temperature changes resulting from the
combined action of magnetic field and uniaxial stress on this metamagnetic
shape-memory alloy. From these results, we can conclude that the multicaloric
response of this alloy by appropriate changes of uniaxial stress and magnetic
field largely outperforms the caloric response of the alloy when subjected to
only a single stimulus. We anticipate that our findings can be applied to other
multicaloric materials, thus inspiring the development of refrigeration devices
based on the multicaloric effect.

our algorithm surpasses the state-of-the-art results and several new best

is competitive with self-supervised approaches, and is state-of-the-art with
100 hours of labeled audio without the use of a language model both at test

threshold for secured fault diagnosis is derived. By applying integral

from the realization of a finite-time transition between a non-equilibrium

this new challenging problem, a systematic trajectory planning approach is
presented. In particular, this problem is facilitated by mapping the kernel
equations into backstepping coordinates and tracing the solution of the

of motion infilling for 3D human motion data. Given a start and end sequence,
motion infilling aims to complete the missing gap in between, such that the
filled in poses plausibly forecast the start sequence and naturally transition
into the end sequence. To this end, we propose a single, end-to-end trainable
convolutional autoencoder. We show that a single model can be used to create
natural transitions between different types of activities. Furthermore, our
method is not only able to fill in entire missing frames, but it can also be
used to complete gaps where partial poses are available (e.g. from end
effectors), or to clean up other forms of noise (e.g. Gaussian). Also, the
model can fill in an arbitrary number of gaps that potentially vary in length.
In addition, no further post-processing on the model's outputs is necessary
such as smoothing or closing discontinuities at the end of the gap. At the
heart of our approach lies the idea to cast motion infilling as an inpainting
problem and to train a convolutional de-noising autoencoder on image-like
representations of motion sequences. At training time, blocks of columns are
removed from such images and we ask the model to fill in the gaps. We
demonstrate the versatility of the approach via a number of complex motion
sequences and report on thorough evaluations performed to better understand the
capabilities and limitations of the proposed approach.

Cassie-Baxter (CB) and Wenzel (W) states of a macroscopic droplet sitting on a
microscopically rough or corrugated substrate, a substrate whose surface is
covered by identical truncated or inverted truncated conical pores is
considered. The free energy landscapes of the intrusion and extrusion processes
of a liquid into single pore are analyzed when the liquid is compressed or
stretched so that the liquid phase is either stable or metastable relative to
the vapor phase. Therefore, this model is also relevant to the stability of the
superhydrophobic submerged substrates. In this study, the macroscopic classical
capillary theory is adopted. Even within this simplified model, two simple
geometries of truncated and inverted truncated cones lead to completely
different free-energy landscapes. A simple criterion for the stability of the
CB state based on Laplace pressure is shown not to be sufficient to understand
the destruction and recovery of the CB state. The free-energy landscapes
indicate that a gradual and an abrupt destruction of CB state is possible,
which depends on the orientation of the conical pore and whether the liquid is

susceptible to adversarial examples, which mislead classifiers by applying
human-imperceptible perturbations on clean inputs. Under the query-free

settle such issue, we design a max-min framework inspired by input
transformations, which are benificial to both the adversarial attack and

with the max-min theory. Extensive experiments on Imagenet demonstrate that our
defense-guided transferable attacks achieve impressive increase on
transferability. Experimentally, we show that our ASR of adversarial attack

12.1% on the normally trained models and by 11.13% on the adversarially trained

neighboring nodes have similar attributes and a node's label can be predicted
from the labels of its neighbors or other proximate (i.e., nearby) nodes in the

to understand the drivers of land expansion and to investigate the landscape

accuracy and more similar landscape pattern metrics to the true landscape than
other CA models tested. The land expansion analysis strategy also uncovered
some underlying transition rules, such as that grassland is most likely to be

forest areas tend to grow adjacent to arterial roads. We also projected the
structure of land use under different optimizing scenarios for 2035 by
combining the proposed model with multi-objective programming. The results

be analysed. Especially if the network consists of multiple groups, this
assumption conflicts with a range of systematic biases, measurement errors and
other inaccuracies that are well documented in the literature. To investigate
the effects of such errors we introduce a framework for simulating systematic
bias in attributed networks. Our framework enables us to model erroneous edge
observations that are driven by external node attributes or errors arising from
the (hidden) network structure itself. We exemplify how systematic inaccuracies
distort conclusions drawn from network analyses on the network analysis task of
minority representations in degree-based rankings. By analysing synthetic and
real networks with varying homophily levels and group sizes, we find that
introducing systematic edge errors can result both in a strongly increased or
decreased ranking of the minority. The observed effect depends both on the type
of edge error considered and level of homophily in the system. We thus conclude
that the implications of systematic bias in edge data depend on an interplay
between network topology and type of systematic error. This emphasises the need
for an error model framework as developed here, which provides a first step
towards studying the effects of systematic edge-uncertainty for various network
analysis tasks.

The main challenge is to learn the unified visual and textual representations.
Previous methods that perform well on this task primarily focus on not only the
alignment between region features in images and the corresponding words in
sentences, but also the alignment between relations of regions and relational
words. However, the lack of joint learning of regional features and global
features will cause the regional features to lose contact with the global
context, leading to the mismatch with those non-object words which have global
meanings in some sentences. In this work, in order to alleviate this issue, it
is necessary to enhance the relations between regions and the relations between
regional and global concepts to obtain a more accurate visual representation so
as to be better correlated to the corresponding text. Thus, a novel multi-level
semantic relations enhancement approach named Dual Semantic Relations Attention
Network(DSRAN) is proposed which mainly consists of two modules, separate
semantic relations module and the joint semantic relations module. DSRAN
performs graph attention in both modules respectively for region-level
relations enhancement and regional-global relations enhancement at the same
time. With these two modules, different hierarchies of semantic relations are
learned simultaneously, thus promoting the image-text matching process by
providing more information for the final visual representation. Quantitative
experimental results have been performed on MS-COCO and Flickr30K and our
method outperforms previous approaches by a large margin due to the
effectiveness of the dual semantic relations learning scheme. Codes are

dealing with the background plasma in the form of a linear dielectric, we study
the non-perturbative properties of the linear dispersion relation, showing the
necessity for a better characterization of the mode growth rate in those flat
regions of the distribution function where the Landau formula is no longer
predictive. We then upgrade the original N-body approach, in order to include a
return current in the background plasma. This correction term is responsible
for smaller saturation levels and growth rates of the Langmuir modes, as result
of the energy density transferred to the plasma via the return current.
Finally, we include friction effects, as those due to the collective influence
of all the plasma charges on the motion of the beam particles. The resulting
force induces a progressive resonance detuning, because particles are losing
energy and decreasing their velocity. This friction phenomenon gives rise to a
deformation of the distribution function, associated with a significant growth
of the less energetic particle population. The merit of this work is to show
how a fine analysis of the beam-plasma instability outlines a number of
subtleties about the linear, intermediate and late dynamics which can be of
relevance when such a system is addressed as a paradigm to describe relevant

Temperature measurements received from the rover are noisy and must be

Currently, a simple Moving Average (MA) filter is used to perform signal
denoising. The application of this basic method relies on the assumption that
the noise is stationary and statistically independent from the underlying
structure of the signal, an arguable assumption in this kind of harsh
environment. In this paper, we analyze the application of two alternative
methods to process the temperature sensor measurements: the Discrete Wavelet

different datasets, one belonging to the current Martian measurement campaigns,
and the other to the Thermal Vacuum Tests. The processing of these datasets
allows to separate the random noise from the interference created by other
systems. The experiments show that the MA filter may provide useful results
under given circumstances. However, the proposed methods allow a better fitting
for all the realistic scenarios, while providing the possibility to identify
and analyze other interesting signal features and artifacts that could be later
studied and classified. The large amount of data to be processed makes
computational efficiency an important requirement in this mission. Considering
the computational cost and the filtering performance, we propose the method
based on DWT as more suitable for this application.

future nanoelectronics and have been intensively investigated. In
nanostructures, the lattice vibrational waves (phonons) deviate drastically
from those in bulk crystals, which gives rise to anomalies in thermodynamic,
elastic, electronic, and magnetic properties. Hence, a thorough understanding
of the physical properties of these materials requires a comprehensive
investigation of the lattice dynamics as a function of the nanowire size. We
performed a systematic lattice dynamics study of endotaxial FeSi$_2$ nanowires,
forming the metastable, surface-stabilized $\alpha$-phase, which are in-plane
embedded into the Si(110) surface. The average widths of the nanowires ranged
from 24 to 3 nm, their lengths ranged from several $\mu$m to about 100 nm. The
Fe-partial phonon density of states, obtained by nuclear inelastic scattering,
exhibits a broadening of the spectral features with decreasing nanowire width.
The experimental data obtained along and across the nanowires unveiled a
pronounced vibrational anisotropy that originates from the specific orientation
of the tetragonal $\alpha$-FeSi$_2$ unit cell on the Si(110) surface. The
results from first-principles calculations are fully consistent with the
experimental data and allow for a comprehensive understanding of the lattice
dynamics of endotaxial silicide nanowires.

$m_\mathrm{PBH}<10^9\mathrm{g}$, evaporate before big-bang nucleosynthesis and
can therefore not be directly constrained. They can however be so abundant that
they dominate the universe content for a transient period (before reheating the
universe via Hawking evaporation). If this happens, they support large
cosmological fluctuations at small scales, which in turn induce the production
of gravitational waves through second-order effects. Contrary to the primordial
black holes, those gravitational waves survive after evaporation, and can
therefore be used to constrain such scenarios. In this work, we show that for
induced gravitational waves not to lead to a backreaction problem, the relative
abundance of black holes at formation, denoted $ \Omega_\mathrm{PBH,f} $,
should be such that $ \Omega_\mathrm{PBH,f}
<10^{-4}(m_\mathrm{PBH}/10^9\mathrm{g})^{-1/4}$. In particular, scenarios where
primordial black holes dominate right upon their formation time are all
excluded (given that $m_\mathrm{PBH}>10\, \mathrm{g}$ for inflation to proceed
at $\rho^{1/4}<10^{16}\mathrm{GeV}$). This sets the first constraints on

promote the face hallucination due to the ability to predict high-frequency
details from a large number of samples. However, most of them fail to take into
account the overall facial profile and fine texture details simultaneously,
resulting in reduced naturalness and fidelity of the reconstructed face, and
further impairing the performance of downstream tasks (e.g., face detection,
facial recognition). To tackle this issue, we propose a novel external-internal
split attention group (ESAG), which encompasses two paths responsible for
facial structure information and facial texture details, respectively. By
fusing the features from these two paths, the consistency of facial structure
and the fidelity of facial details are strengthened at the same time. Then, we
propose a split-attention in split-attention network (SISN) to reconstruct
photorealistic high-resolution facial images by cascading several ESAGs.
Experimental results on face hallucination and face recognition unveil that the
proposed method not only significantly improves the clarity of hallucinated
faces, but also encourages the subsequent face recognition performance
substantially. Codes have been released at

placed. Target movements and deformations are monitored by comparing images of
the dots taken at various times during the measurement. The images are acquired

As a result, the target monitoring fulfils the needs of the experiment.

base of their affinity for an Antigen (Ag), and Ag availability tunes the
selective pressure. In cases when this selective pressure is high the number of
B-cells might quickly decrease and the population might risk extinction in what
is known as a population bottleneck. Here we study the probability for a B-cell

affinity for the Ag. Using recursive relations and probability generating
functions we derive expressions for the average extinction time and progeny
size for lineages that go extinct. We then extend our results to the full

and gaseous components usually results from an external gas accretion and/or
interaction with other galaxies. The extreme case of the kinematic misalignment
is demonstrated by so-called galaxies with counterrotation that possess two
distinct components rotating in opposite directions with respect to each other.
We provide an in-deep analysis of galaxies with counterrotation from
IllustrisTNG100 cosmological simulations. We have found $25$ galaxies with
substantial stellar counterrotation in the stellar mass range of
$2\times10^{9}-3\times10^{10}$~\Msun. In our sample the stellar counterrotation
is a result of an external gas infall happened $\approx 2-8$~Gyr ago. The
infall leads to the initial removal of pre-existing gas, which is captured and
mixed together with the infalling component. The gas mixture ends up in the
counterrotating gaseous disc. We show that $\approx 90\%$ of the stellar
counterrotation formed in-situ, in the counterrotating gas. During the early
phases of the infall, gas can be found in inclined extended and rather thin
disc-like structures, and in some galaxies they are similar to (nearly-)~polar
disc or ring-like structures. We discuss a possible link between the gas
infall, AGN activity and the formation of misaligned components. In particular,
we suggest that the AGN activity does not cause the counterrotation, although
it is efficiently triggered by the retrograde gas infall, and it correlates
well with the misaligned component appearance. We also find evidence of the
stellar disc heating visible as an increase of the vertical-to-radial velocity
dispersion ratio above unity in both co- and counterrotating components, which
implies the importance of the kinematical misalignment in shaping the velocity
ellipsoids in disc galaxies.

hypercube Laplacian on functions $f:\mathscr{C}_n\to E$, whose target space $E$
has nontrivial Rademacher type via a new vector-valued version of Meyer's
multiplier theorem (1984). Inspired by Talagrand's influence inequality, we
introduce a new metric invariant called Talagrand type and estimate it for
Banach spaces with prescribed Rademacher or martingale type, Gromov hyperbolic

physical principles that govern the fate of respiratory droplets and any
viruses trapped inside them, with a focus on the role of relative humidity.
Importantly, low relative humidity -- as encountered, for instance, indoors
during winter and inside aircraft -- facilitates evaporation and keeps even
initially large droplets suspended in air as aerosol for extended periods of
time. What is more, relative humidity affects the stability of viruses in
aerosol through several physical mechanisms such as efflorescence and
inactivation at the air-water interface, whose role in virus inactivation
nonetheless remains poorly understood. Elucidating the role of relative
humidity in the droplet spread of disease would permit us to design preventive
measures that could aid in reducing the chance of transmission, particularly in
indoor environment.

evolution of Itamar Pitowsky's thinking about probability in quantum theory
from 1994 to 2008, and the role of Gleason's 1957 theorem in his derivation of
the Born Rule. Pitowsky's defence of probability therein as a logic of partial
belief leads us into a broader discussion of probability in physics, in which
the existence of objective ""chances"" is questioned, and the status of David
Lewis' influential Principal Principle is critically examined. This is followed
by a sketch of the work by David Deutsch and David Wallace which resulted in
the Deutsch-Wallace (DW) theorem in Everettian quantum mechanics. It is
noteworthy that the authors of this important decision-theoretic derivation of
the Born Rule have different views concerning the meaning of probability. The
theorem, which was the subject of a 2007 critique by Meir Hemmo and Pitowsky,
is critically examined, along with recent related work by John Earman. Here our
main argument is that the DW theorem does not provide a justification of the
Principal Principle, contrary to claims by Wallace and Simon Saunders. A final
section analyses recent claims to the effect that that the DW theorem is
redundant, a conclusion that seems to be reinforced by consideration of
probabilities in ""deviant' branches in the Everettian multiverse.

averaging strategies. So far, PLL methods without such techniques have been

verification requires a large amount of data, therefore users usually need to
adopt third-party data ($e.g.$, data from the Internet or third-party data
company). This raises the question of whether adopting untrusted third-party
data can pose a security threat. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is
possible to inject the hidden backdoor for infecting speaker verification
models by poisoning the training data. Specifically, we design a
clustering-based attack scheme where poisoned samples from different clusters
will contain different triggers ($i.e.$, pre-defined utterances), based on our
understanding of verification tasks. The infected models behave normally on
benign samples, while attacker-specified unenrolled triggers will successfully
pass the verification even if the attacker has no information about the
enrolled speaker. We also demonstrate that existing backdoor attacks cannot be
directly adopted in attacking speaker verification. Our approach not only
provides a new perspective for designing novel attacks, but also serves as a
strong baseline for improving the robustness of verification methods. The code

simulations have been developed to simulate molecular systems, where an
explicit description of changes in the electronic structure is necessary.
However, QM/MM MD simulations are computationally expensive compared to fully
classical simulations as all valence electrons are treated explicitly and a
self-consistent field (SCF) procedure is required. Recently, approaches have
been proposed to replace the QM description with machine learned (ML) models.
However, condensed-phase systems pose a challenge for these approaches due to
long-range interactions. Here, we establish a workflow, which incorporates the
MM environment as an element type in a high-dimensional neural network
potential (HDNNP). The fitted HDNNP describes the potential-energy surface of
the QM particles with an electrostatic embedding scheme. Thus, the MM particles
feel a force from the polarized QM particles. To achieve chemical accuracy, we
find that even simple systems require models with a strong gradient
regularization, a large number of data points, and a substantial number of
parameters. To address this issue, we extend our approach to a delta-learning
scheme, where the ML model learns the difference between a reference method
(DFT) and a cheaper semi-empirical method (DFTB). We show that such a scheme
reaches the accuracy of the DFT reference method, while requiring significantly
less parameters. Furthermore, the delta-learning scheme is capable of correctly
incorporating long-range interactions within a cutoff of 1.4 nm. It is
validated by performing MD simulations of retinoic acid in water and the
interaction between S-adenoslymethioniat with cytosine in water. The presented
results indicate that delta-learning is a promising approach for (QM)ML/MM MD
simulations of condensed-phase systems.

bottleneck in a federated network coupled with privacy concerns, usually
powered by a wide-area network (WAN). Such a WAN-driven FL design leads to
significantly high cost and much slower model convergence. In this work, we
propose an efficient FL protocol, which involves a hierarchical aggregation

almost negligible monetary cost than WAN. Our proposed FL can accelerate the

in the same LAN and infrequent global aggregation on a cloud across WAN. We
further design a concrete FL platform, namely LanFL, that incorporates several
key techniques to handle those challenges introduced by LAN: cloud-device

inter-LAN bandwidth capacity heterogeneity. We evaluate LanFL on 2 typical

detect the onset of acceleration, as an early warning of the impending
catastrophe. We focus on the fracture of heterogeneous materials using a fiber
bundle model, which exhibits transitions between perfectly brittle,
quasi-brittle, and ductile behaviors as the amount of disorder is increased.
Analyzing the lifetime of record size bursts, we demonstrate that the
acceleration starts at a characteristic record rank, below which record
breaking slows down due to the dominance of disorder in fracturing, while above
it stress redistribution gives rise to an enhanced triggering of bursts and
acceleration of the dynamics. The emergence of this signal depends on the
degree of disorder making both highly brittle fracture of low disorder

We prove in an infinite-dimensional setting that, first, the solutions of these

second, that an inexact Newton method enjoys fast local convergence when
applied to a reformulation of the optimality system in which the control

features that evolve as a function of time. These visual features contain
valuable clues for deducing the physical properties of the galaxy mergers. In
this work, we propose DeepGalaxy, a visual analysis framework trained to
predict the physical properties of galaxy mergers based on their morphology.
Based on an encoder-decoder architecture, DeepGalaxy encodes the input images
to a compressed latent space $z$, and determines the similarity of images
according to the latent-space distance. DeepGalaxy consists of a fully
convolutional autoencoder (FCAE) which generates activation maps at its 3D
latent-space, and a variational autoencoder (VAE) which compresses the
activation maps into a 1D vector, and a classifier that generates labels from
the activation maps. The backbone of the FCAE can be fully customized according
to the complexity of the images. DeepGalaxy demonstrates excellent scaling
performance on parallel machines. On the Endeavour supercomputer, the scaling
efficiency exceeds 0.93 when trained on 128 workers, and it maintains above

is observed with radio interferometry and is widely used to infer parameters
and structure of the innermost jet regions. The position of the radio core is
typically estimated by fitting a Gaussian template to the interferometric
visibilities. This results in a model approximation error, i.e. a bias that can
be detected and evaluated through simulations of observations with a realistic
jet model. To assess the bias, we construct an artificial sample of sources
based on the AGN jet model evaluated on a grid of the parameters derived from a
real VLBI flux-density-limited sample and create simulated VLBI data sets at
2.3, 8.1 and 15.4 GHz. We found that the core position shifts from the true jet
apex are generally overestimated. The bias is typically comparable to the core
shift random error and can reach a factor of two for jets with large apparent
opening angles. This observational bias depends mostly on the ratio between the
true core shift and the image resolution. This implies that the magnetic field,
the core radial distance and the jet speed inferred from the core shift
measurements are overestimated. We present a method to account for the bias.

model that mimics too closely (or exactly) a particular instance of data, and
may therefore fail to predict future observations reliably. In practice, this
behaviour is controlled by various--sometimes heuristics--regularization
techniques, which are motivated by developing upper bounds to the
generalization error. In this work, we study the generalization error of
classifiers relying on stochastic encodings trained on the cross-entropy loss,
which is often used in deep learning for classification problems. We derive
bounds to the generalization error showing that there exists a regime where the
generalization error is bounded by the mutual information between input
features and the corresponding representations in the latent space, which are
randomly generated according to the encoding distribution. Our bounds provide
an information-theoretic understanding of generalization in the so-called class
of variational classifiers, which are regularized by a Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence term. These results give theoretical grounds for the highly popular
KL term in variational inference methods that was already recognized to act
effectively as a regularization penalty. We further observe connections with
well studied notions such as Variational Autoencoders, Information Dropout,
Information Bottleneck and Boltzmann Machines. Finally, we perform numerical
experiments on MNIST and CIFAR datasets and show that mutual information is

more interpretable and robust but less predictive. Using their complementary
nature, this study designs a theory-based residual neural network (TB-ResNet)
framework, which synergizes discrete choice models (DCMs) and deep neural
networks (DNNs) based on their shared utility interpretation. The TB-ResNet
framework is simple, as it uses a ($\delta$, 1-$\delta$) weighting to take
advantage of DCMs' simplicity and DNNs' richness, and to prevent underfitting
from the DCMs and overfitting from the DNNs. This framework is also flexible:
three instances of TB-ResNets are designed based on multinomial logit model
(MNL-ResNets), prospect theory (PT-ResNets), and hyperbolic discounting
(HD-ResNets), which are tested on three data sets. Compared to pure DCMs, the
TB-ResNets provide greater prediction accuracy and reveal a richer set of
behavioral mechanisms owing to the utility function augmented by the DNN
component in the TB-ResNets. Compared to pure DNNs, the TB-ResNets can modestly
improve prediction and significantly improve interpretation and robustness,
because the DCM component in the TB-ResNets stabilizes the utility functions
and input gradients. Overall, this study demonstrates that it is both feasible

specifications under a TB-ResNet framework. Although some limitations remain,
this TB-ResNet framework is an important first step to create mutual benefits

of voice conversion. However, most of the StarGAN-based methods only focused on
voice conversion experiments for the situations where the number of speakers
was small, and the amount of training data was large. In this work, we aim at
improving the data efficiency of the model and achieving a many-to-many
non-parallel StarGAN-based voice conversion for a relatively large number of
speakers with limited training samples. In order to improve data efficiency,
the proposed model uses a speaker encoder for extracting speaker embeddings and
conducts adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN) on convolutional weights.
Experiments are conducted with 109 speakers under two low-resource situations,
where the number of training samples is 20 and 5 per speaker. An objective
evaluation shows the proposed model is better than the baseline methods.
Furthermore, a subjective evaluation shows that, for both naturalness and

The subject of distributed-order non-local derivatives is currently under

  of Sequential Work",,,,,"quant-ph cs.CC cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We revisit the so-called compressed oracle technique, introduced by Zhandry
for analyzing quantum algorithms in the quantum random oracle model (QROM). To
start off with, we offer a concise exposition of the technique, which easily
extends to the parallel-query QROM, where in each query-round the considered
algorithm may make several queries to the QROM in parallel. This variant of the
QROM allows for a more fine-grained query-complexity analysis.
  Our main technical contribution is a framework that simplifies the use of
(the parallel-query generalization of) the compressed oracle technique for
proving query complexity results. With our framework in place, whenever
applicable, it is possible to prove quantum query complexity lower bounds by
means of purely classical reasoning. More than that, for typical examples the
crucial classical observations that give rise to the classical bounds are
sufficient to conclude the corresponding quantum bounds.
  We demonstrate this on a few examples, recovering known results (like the
optimality of parallel Grover), but also obtaining new results (like the
optimality of parallel BHT collision search). Our main target is the hardness
of finding a $q$-chain with fewer than $q$ parallel queries, i.e., a sequence
$x_0, x_1,\ldots, x_q$ with $x_i = H(x_{i-1})$ for all $1 \leq i \leq q$.
  The above problem of finding a hash chain is of fundamental importance in the
context of proofs of sequential work. Indeed, as a concrete cryptographic
application of our techniques, we prove that the ""Simple Proofs of Sequential
Work"" proposed by Cohen and Pietrzak remains secure against quantum attacks.
Such an analysis is not simply a matter of plugging in our new bound; the
entire protocol needs to be analyzed in the light of a quantum attack. Thanks
to our framework, this can now be done with purely classical reasoning.

deterioration in the agent performance as soon as possible. Furthermore, it
often has to be done without modifying the policy and under minimal assumptions

directly on the rewards and testing for degradation. We consider an episodic
framework, where the rewards within each episode are not independent, nor
identically-distributed, nor Markov. We present this problem as a multivariate
mean-shift detection problem with possibly partial observations. We define the
mean-shift in a way corresponding to deterioration of a temporal signal (such
as the rewards), and derive a test for this problem with optimal statistical
power. Empirically, on deteriorated rewards in control problems (generated
using various environment modifications), the test is demonstrated to be more
powerful than standard tests - often by orders of magnitude. We also suggest a
novel Bootstrap mechanism for False Alarm Rate control (BFAR), applicable to
episodic (non-i.i.d) signal and allowing our test to run sequentially in an

to feedback on recently updated and released standards, and defining new
standards. Community feedback and contributions are needed for all DAL
activities. Particularly important are the experiences of data providers and
projects that are using VO technologies to address their scientific community's
requirements. This is not a trivial task since the development of a
standardised interface for the final user often requires more than one
Recommendation to be implemented. This contribution aims to summarise the
current DAL status and progress, in order to help new end-users understand how
DAL can be beneficial. It also discusses the future changes to DAL standards
and lists topics (No-SQL, code-to-data, parametric querying, actionable
retrieval, ...) worth investigating in the future to keep access layer
standardisation up to date with current needs.

between source and target speeches without using a parallel corpus. Recently,
cycle-consistent adversarial network (CycleGAN)-VC and CycleGAN-VC2 have shown
promising results regarding this problem and have been widely used as benchmark
methods. However, owing to the ambiguity of the effectiveness of
CycleGAN-VC/VC2 for mel-spectrogram conversion, they are typically used for
mel-cepstrum conversion even when comparative methods employ mel-spectrogram as
a conversion target. To address this, we examined the applicability of
CycleGAN-VC/VC2 to mel-spectrogram conversion. Through initial experiments, we
discovered that their direct applications compromised the time-frequency
structure that should be preserved during conversion. To remedy this, we
propose CycleGAN-VC3, an improvement of CycleGAN-VC2 that incorporates
time-frequency adaptive normalization (TFAN). Using TFAN, we can adjust the
scale and bias of the converted features while reflecting the time-frequency
structure of the source mel-spectrogram. We evaluated CycleGAN-VC3 on
inter-gender and intra-gender non-parallel VC. A subjective evaluation of
naturalness and similarity showed that for every VC pair, CycleGAN-VC3
outperforms or is competitive with the two types of CycleGAN-VC2, one of which
was applied to mel-cepstrum and the other to mel-spectrogram. Audio samples are

impact the discussions : calculation of DM relic density, detection of the DM
in Direct and Indirect experiments and creation /detection at the Colliders. In
case of SUSY, the results from Higgs and SUSY searches at the colliders also
have implications for the DM mass and couplings. In view of the constraints
coming from all these sources, the possibility of a light neutralino is all but
ruled out for the constrained MSSM : cMSSM. The pMSSM, where the gaugino masses
are not related at high scale, is also quite constrained and under tension in
case of thermal DM and will be put to very stern test in the near future in
Direct Detection (DD) experiments as well as by the LHC analyses. However in
the pMSSM with modified cosmology and hence non-thermal DM or in the NMSSM, a
light neutralino is much more easily accommodated. A light RH sneutrino is also
still a viable DM candidate although it requires extending the MSSM with
additional singlet neutrino superfields. All of these possibilities can be
indeed tested jointly in the upcoming SUSY-electroweakino and Higgs searches at

between different organizations is/ was crucial to develop a significant
movement to avoid the massive infection and decrease the number of deaths.
However, the data subject, i.e., the users, should have the right to request
the purpose of data use, anonymization, and data deletion. In this sense,
permissioned blockchain technology emerges to empower users to get their rights
providing data ownership, transparency, and security through an immutable,

Therefore, in order to organize the relationship between data owners and the

liquefaction has exacerbated after recent failures of upstream-raised tailings
storage facilities (TSF). Standard practices to evaluate global stability of
TSFs entail the use of limit equilibrium analyses considering peak and residual
undrained shear strengths; thus, neglecting the work input required to drive
the softening process that leads to progressive failure of susceptible
tailings. This paper presents a simplified procedure to evaluate the static
liquefaction triggering of upstream-raised TSFs by means of finite element
models employing the well-known Hardening Soil model with small-strain
stiffness (HSS). A calibration methodology is proposed to overcome the model
limitation of not being implemented in a critical state framework, focusing on
the stiffness parameters that control the rate of shear-induced plastic
volumetric strains. A real TSF is modelled in Plaxis 2D to evaluate its
vulnerability to liquefy due to an undrained lateral spreading at the
foundation. Results show that minor movements near the toe induce the material
into a strain-softening regime that leads to a progressive failure towards the
structure crest.

computations and make occasional recourse to expensive high-fidelity models to
establish accuracy guarantees. Because surrogate and high-fidelity models are
used together, poor predictions by surrogate models can be compensated with
frequent recourse to high-fidelity models. Thus, there is a trade-off between
investing computational resources to improve the accuracy of surrogate models
versus simply making more frequent recourse to expensive high-fidelity models;
however, this trade-off is ignored by traditional modeling methods that
construct surrogate models that are meant to replace high-fidelity models
rather than being used together with high-fidelity models. This work considers
multi-fidelity importance sampling and theoretically and computationally trades
off increasing the fidelity of surrogate models for constructing more accurate
biasing densities and the numbers of samples that are required from the
high-fidelity models to compensate poor biasing densities. Numerical examples
demonstrate that such context-aware surrogate models for multi-fidelity
importance sampling have lower fidelity than what typically is set as tolerance

passing by the microphone. VC is carried out via local minima detection in the
predicted distance. We propose to set the minima detection threshold at a point
where the probabilities of false positives and false negatives coincide so they
statistically cancel each other in total vehicle number. The method is trained
and tested on a traffic-monitoring dataset comprising $422$ short, $20$-second
one-channel sound files with a total of $ 1421 $ vehicles passing by the

below $ 2 \%$ within a wide range of detection threshold values. Experimental
results show that the regression accuracy in noisy environments is improved by
introducing a novel high-frequency power feature.

perturbative decay can affect different stages of the reheating. We study the

Poisson point process of moving wireless interferers. The queue is driven by an
external arrival process and is subject to a time-varying service process that
is a function of the SINR that it sees. Static configurations of interferers
result in an infinite queue workload with positive probability. In contrast, a
generic stability condition is established for the queue in the case where
interferers possess any non-zero mobility that results in displacements that
are both independent across interferers and oblivious to interferer positions.
The proof leverages the mixing property of the Poisson point process. The
effect of an increase in mobility on queueing metrics is also studied. Convex
ordering tools are used to establish that faster moving interferers result in a
queue workload that is smaller for the increasing-convex stochastic order. As a
corollary, mean workload and mean delay decrease as network mobility increases.
This stochastic ordering as a function of mobility is explained by establishing
positive correlations between SINR level-crossing events at different time
points, and by determining the autocorrelation function for interference and
observing that it decreases with increasing mobility. System behaviour is
empirically analyzed using discrete-event simulation and the performance of
various mobility models is evaluated using heavy-traffic approximations.

source task and applying it to a different but related target task. A
fundamental question in transfer learning is whether combining the data of both
tasks works better than using only the target task's data (equivalently,
whether a ""positive information transfer"" happens). We study this question
formally in a linear regression setting where a two-layer linear neural network
estimator combines both tasks' data. The estimator uses a shared parameter
vector for both tasks and exhibits positive or negative information transfer by
varying dataset characteristics.
  We characterize the precise asymptotic limit of the prediction risk of the
above estimator when the sample sizes increase with the feature dimension
proportionally at fixed ratios. We also show that the asymptotic limit is
sufficiently accurate for finite dimensions. Then, we provide the exact
condition to determine positive (and negative) information transfer in a
random-effect model, leading to several theoretical insights. For example, the
risk curve is non-monotone under model shift, thus motivating a transfer
learning procedure that progressively adds data from the source task. We
validate this procedure's efficiency on text classification tasks with a neural
network that applies a shared feature space for both tasks, similar to the
above estimator. The main ingredient of the analysis is finding the
high-dimensional asymptotic limits of various functions involving the sum of
two independent sample covariance matrices with different population covariance
matrices, which may be of independent interest.

large quantities of heat through the transport of water from deep within the
edifice to the surface. Thus, heat flux is a prime tool for evaluating volcanic
activity and unrest. We review the volcanic unrest at La Soufri\`ere de
Guadeloupe (French West Indies) using an airborne thermal camera survey, and
in-situ measurements of temperature and flow rate through temperature probes,
Pitot-tube and MultiGAS measurements. We deduce mass and heat fluxes for the
fumarolic, ground and thermal spring outputs and follow these over a period
spanning 2000--2020. Our results are compared with published data and we
performed a retrospective analysis of the temporal variations in heat flux over
this period using the literature data.
  We find that the heat emitted by the volcano is 36.5 +/- 7.9 MW, of which the
fumarolic heat flux is dominant at 28.3 +/- 6.8 MW. Given a total heated area
of 26780 m2, this equates to a heat flux density of 627 +/- 94 W/m2, which is
amongst the highest established for worldwide volcanoes with hydrothermal
systems, particularly for dome volcanoes. A major change at La Soufri\`ere de
Guadeloupe, however, is the development of a widespread region of ground
heating at the summit where heat output has increased from 0.2 +/- 0.1 MW in
2010 to 5.7 +/- 0.9 MW in 2020. This change is concurrent with accelerating
unrest at the volcano, and the emergence of two new high-flux fumaroles in
recent years. Our findings highlight the importance of continued and enhanced
surveillance and research strategies at La Soufri\`ere de Guadeloupe, the
results of which can be used to better understand hydrothermal volcanism the

demonstrate that coherent phonons at the K-point of the Brillouin zone can
effectively mediate the valley transfer of electron carriers. In the MoSe2

which has broken inversion symmetry and thus can enable electron spin-flip
during valley transfer. On the other hand, in the monolayer WSe2 case where
spin-preserving inter-valley relaxations are preferred coherent LA(K) phonons
with even inversion symmetry are efficiently generated. These findings
establish that, while the specifics of inter-valley relaxations depend on the
spin alignments of energy bands, the K-point phonons should be taken into
account as an effective valley depolarization pathway in transition metal

adapt to its environment. However, the underlying plasticity rules that govern
learning are unknown. Many proposals have been suggested, including Hebbian
mechanisms, explicit error backpropagation, and a variety of alternatives. It
is an open question as to what specific experimental measurements would need to
be made to determine whether any given learning rule is operative in a real
biological system. In this work, we take a ""virtual experimental"" approach to
this problem. Simulating idealized neuroscience experiments with artificial
neural networks, we generate a large-scale dataset of learning trajectories of
aggregate statistics measured in a variety of neural network architectures,
loss functions, learning rule hyperparameters, and parameter initializations.
We then take a discriminative approach, training linear and simple non-linear
classifiers to identify learning rules from features based on these
observables. We show that different classes of learning rules can be separated
solely on the basis of aggregate statistics of the weights, activations, or
instantaneous layer-wise activity changes, and that these results generalize to
limited access to the trajectory and held-out architectures and learning
curricula. We identify the statistics of each observable that are most relevant
for rule identification, finding that statistics from network activities across
training are more robust to unit undersampling and measurement noise than those
obtained from the synaptic strengths. Our results suggest that activation
patterns, available from electrophysiological recordings of post-synaptic
activities on the order of several hundred units, frequently measured at wider
intervals over the course of learning, may provide a good basis on which to
identify learning rules.

estimate the prompt neutron period of fissile assemblies. The method and
quantity are of widespread interest including in applications such as nuclear
criticality safety, safeguards and nonproliferation, and stockpile stewardship;
the prompt neutron period may also be used to infer the $k_\text{eff}$
multiplication factor. The Feynman-alpha method is predicated on
time-correlated neutron detections that deviate from a Poisson random variable
due to multiplication. Traditionally, such measurements are diagnosed with
one-region point kinetics, but two-region models are required when the fissile
assembly is reflected. This paper presents a derivation of the two-region point
kinetics Feynman-alpha equations based on a double integration of the
Rossi-alpha equations, develops novel propagation of measurement uncertainty,
and validates the theory. Validation is achieved with organic scintillator
measurements of weapons-grade plutonium reflected by various amounts of copper
to achieve $k_\text{eff}$ values of 0.83-0.94 and prompt periods of 5-75 ns.
The results demonstrate that Feynman-alpha measurements should use the
two-region model instead of the one-region model. The simplified one-region
model deviates from the validated two-region models by as much as 10\% in the
estimate of the prompt neutron period, and the two-region model reduces to the
one-region model for small amounts of reflector. The Feynman-alpha estimates of
the prompt neutron period are compared to those of the Rossi-alpha approach.
The comparative results demonstrate that the Feynman-alpha method is more
precise than the Rossi-alpha method and more accurate for $k_\text{eff}<0.92$,
whereas the Rossi-alpha method is generally more accurate for higher
multiplications.

percolation models that are not (necessarily) positively correlated. These
models lack the property of positive associations (also known as the `FKG
inequality'), and hence many classical arguments in percolation theory do not
apply. More precisely, we consider a smooth stationary centred planar Gaussian
field $f$ and, given a level $\ell \in \mathbb{R}$, we study the connectivity
properties of the excursion set $\{f \geq -\ell\}$. We prove the existence of a
phase transition at the critical level $\ell_{crit}=0$ under only symmetry and
(very mild) correlation decay assumptions, which are satisfied by the random
plane wave for instance. As a consequence, all non-zero level lines are bounded
almost surely, although our result does not settle the boundedness of zero
level lines (`no percolation at criticality').
  To show our main result: (i) we prove a general sharp threshold criterion,
inspired by works of Chatterjee, that states that `sharp thresholds are
equivalent to the delocalisation of the threshold location'; (ii) we prove
threshold delocalisation for crossing events at large scales -- at this step we
obtain a sharp threshold result but without being able to locate the threshold
-- and (iii) to identify the threshold, we adapt Tassion's RSW theory replacing
the FKG inequality by a sprinkling procedure. Although some arguments are
specific to the Gaussian setting, many steps are very general and we hope that
our techniques may be adapted to analyse other models without FKG.

simulating piecewise deterministic Markov processes (PDMPs), have recently
shown great promise: they are non-reversible, can mix better than standard MCMC
algorithms, and can use subsampling ideas to speed up computation in big data
scenarios. However, current PDMP samplers can only sample from posterior
densities that are differentiable almost everywhere, which precludes their use
for model choice. Motivated by variable selection problems, we show how to
develop reversible jump PDMP samplers that can jointly explore the discrete
space of models and the continuous space of parameters. Our framework is
general: it takes any existing PDMP sampler, and adds two types of
trans-dimensional moves that allow for the addition or removal of a variable
from the model. We show how the rates of these trans-dimensional moves can be
calculated so that the sampler has the correct invariant distribution.
Simulations show that the new samplers can mix better than standard MCMC
algorithms. Our empirical results show they are also more efficient than
gradient-based samplers that avoid model choice through use of continuous
spike-and-slab priors which replace a point mass at zero for each parameter
with a density concentrated around zero.

charges into the Poisson-Boltzmann equation dressed by a background monovalent

nanofluidic transport of electrolyte mixtures. We find that the experimentally
observed negative streaming currents in anionic nanochannels originate from the
collective effect of the Cl attraction by the interfacially adsorbed
multivalent cations, and the no-slip layer reducing the hydrodynamic
contribution of these cations to the net current. The like-charge current
condition emerging from this collective mechanism is shown to be the reversal
of the average potential within the no-slip zone. Applying the formalism to
surface-coated membrane nanoslits located in the giant dielectric permittivity
regime, we reveal a new type of streaming current activated by attractive
polarization forces. Under the effect of these forces, the addition of
multivalent ions into the KCl solution sets a charge separation and generates a
counterion current between the neutral slit walls. The adjustability of the
current characteristics solely via the valency and amount of the added
multivalent ions identifies the underlying process as a promising mechanism for
nanofluidic ion separation purposes.

and white) image classification. Although there has been a great deal of work
on attacking models for colored and grayscale images, little is known about
attacks on models for binary images. Models trained to classify binary images
are used in text recognition applications such as check processing, license
plate recognition, invoice processing, and many others. In contrast to colored
and grayscale images, the search space of attacks on binary images is extremely
restricted and noise cannot be hidden with minor perturbations in each pixel.
Thus, the optimization landscape of attacks on binary images introduces new
fundamental challenges.
  In this paper we introduce a new attack algorithm called SCAR, designed to
fool classifiers of binary images. We show that SCAR significantly outperforms
existing $L_0$ attacks applied to the binary setting and use it to demonstrate
the vulnerability of real-world text recognition systems. SCAR's strong
performance in practice contrasts with the existence of classifiers that are
provably robust to large perturbations. In many cases, altering a single pixel
is sufficient to trick Tesseract, a popular open-source text recognition
system, to misclassify a word as a different word in the English dictionary. We
also license software from providers of check processing systems to most of the
major US banks and demonstrate the vulnerability of check recognitions for
mobile deposits. These systems are substantially harder to fool since they
classify both the handwritten amounts in digits and letters, independently.
Nevertheless, we generalize SCAR to design attacks that fool state-of-the-art
check processing systems using unnoticeable perturbations that lead to
misclassification of deposit amounts. Consequently, this is a powerful method
to perform financial fraud.

analytical and transparent method, the counter-rotating-hybridized
rotating-wave (CHRW) method. This approach, which is based on unitary
transformations with a single parameter, treats the rotating and
counter-rotating terms on equal footing. In the unitarily transformed
representation, we find that it is the multiple-harmonic terms shown in the
transformed Hamiltonian that make a crucial contribution to the generation of
the exotic plateau phenomenon. By comparing the results of the numerically
exact calculation and several other methods, we show that the CHRW results
obtained by analytical formalism involving the collective effects of multiple
harmonics are in good agreement with the numerical results, which illustrates
not only the general tendency of the dynamical evolution of strongly driven
TLS, but also the interesting phenomena of plateaus. The developed CHRW method
reveals two kinds of plateau patterns: zigzag plateau and armchair plateau. The
plateau phenomenon has a periodical pattern whose frequency is double the
driving frequency, and possesses quantized oscillations the number of which has
a certain, precise value. Besides, fast oscillation is produced on every
plateau which is determined by the relevant driving parameters of the TLS. Our
main results are as follows: (i) in the large-amplitude oscillatory case, it
turns out that the collective effects of all even harmonics contribute to the
generation of zigzag plateau with quantized oscillation; (ii) in the
small-amplitude oscillatory case, the dynamics of the coherent destruction of
tunneling under strong driving is exactly exhibited by including the
odd-harmonic effect, namely, armchair plateau possessing a two-stair structure

nodes' information from their direct neighbors while neglecting the sequential
nature of multi-hop node connections. Such sequential node connections e.g.,
metapaths, capture critical insights for downstream tasks. Concretely, in
recommender systems (RSs), disregarding these insights leads to inadequate
distillation of collaborative signals. In this paper, we employ collaborative
subgraphs (CSGs) and metapaths to form metapath-aware subgraphs, which
explicitly capture sequential semantics in graph structures. We propose
meta\textbf{P}ath and \textbf{E}ntity-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{N}eural \textbf{N}etwork (PEAGNN), which trains multilayer GNNs to
perform metapath-aware information aggregation on such subgraphs. This
aggregated information from different metapaths is then fused using attention
mechanism. Finally, PEAGNN gives us the representations for node and subgraph,
which can be used to train MLP for predicting score for target user-item pairs.
To leverage the local structure of CSGs, we present entity-awareness that acts
as a contrastive regularizer on node embedding. Moreover, PEAGNN can be
combined with prominent layers such as GAT, GCN and GraphSage. Our empirical
evaluation shows that our proposed technique outperforms competitive baselines
on several datasets for recommendation tasks. Further analysis demonstrates
that PEAGNN also learns meaningful metapath combinations from a given set of
metapaths.

excitation stored in an ensemble of $N$ entangled atoms. Qubit rotations are
performed by applying microwave fields that drive excitations between Rydberg
states. Coherent read-out is performed by mapping the excitation into a single
photon. Ramsey interferometry is used to probe the coherence of the qubit, and
to test the robustness to external perturbations. We show that qubit coherence
is preserved even as we lose atoms from the polariton mode, preserving Ramsey
fringe visibility. We show that dephasing due to electric field noise scales as
the fourth power of field amplitude. These results show that robust quantum
information processing can be achieved via collective encoding using Rydberg
polaritons, and hence this system could provide an attractive alternative
coding strategy for quantum computation and networking.

current. This phenomenon takes place in various setups such as in
noncentrosymmetric crystals and semiconductor pn junctions. Recently, we
proposed a theory for producing DC spin current in magnets using
electromagnetic waves, i.e., the spin-current counterpart of the solar cells.
Our calculation shows that the nonlinear conductivity for the spin current is
nonzero in a variety of noncentrosymmetric magnets, implying that the
phenomenon is ubiquitous in inversion-asymmetric materials with magnetic
excitations. Intuitively, this phenomenon is a bulk photovoltaic effect of
magnetic excitations, where electrons and holes, visible light, and
inversion-asymmetric semiconductors are replaced with magnons or spinons, THz
or GHz waves, and asymmetric magnetic insulators, respectively. We also show
that the photon-driven spin current is shift current type, and as a result, the
current is stable against impurity scattering. This bulk photovoltaic spin
current is in sharp contrast to that of well-known spin pumping that takes
place at the interface between a magnet and a metal.

  Method","Accepted by SIGIR'21",,"10.1145/3404835.3462971",,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is an emerging technique for information
retrieval (IR) applications. While GCN assumes the homophily property of a
graph, real-world graphs are never perfect: the local structure of a node may
contain discrepancy, e.g., the labels of a node's neighbors could vary. This
pushes us to consider the discrepancy of local structure in GCN modeling.
Existing work approaches this issue by introducing an additional module such as
graph attention, which is expected to learn the contribution of each neighbor.
However, such module may not work reliably as expected, especially when there
lacks supervision signal, e.g., when the labeled data is small. Moreover,
existing methods focus on modeling the nodes in the training data, and never
consider the local structure discrepancy of testing nodes.
  This work focuses on the local structure discrepancy issue for testing nodes,
which has received little scrutiny. From a novel perspective of causality, we
investigate whether a GCN should trust the local structure of a testing node
when predicting its label. To this end, we analyze the working mechanism of GCN
with causal graph, estimating the causal effect of a node's local structure for
the prediction. The idea is simple yet effective: given a trained GCN model, we
first intervene the prediction by blocking the graph structure; we then compare
the original prediction with the intervened prediction to assess the causal
effect of the local structure on the prediction. Through this way, we can
eliminate the impact of local structure discrepancy and make more accurate
prediction. Extensive experiments on seven node classification datasets show
that our method effectively enhances the inference stage of GCN.

  minded systems","24 pages. Final version accepted for publication in Mathematische
  Zeitschrift",,,,"math.RT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  If $k$ is a field, $A$ a finite dimensional $k$-algebra, then the simple
$A$-modules form a simple minded collection in the derived category
$\operatorname{D}^b( \operatorname{mod} A )$. Their extension closure is
$\operatorname{mod} A$; in particular, it is abelian. This situation is
emulated by a general simple minded collection $\mathcal{S}$ in a suitable
triangulated category $\mathcal{C}$. In particular, the extension closure
$\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ is abelian, and there is a tilting theory for
such abelian subcategories of $\mathcal{C}$. These statements follow from
$\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ being the heart of a bounded $t$-structure.
  It is a defining characteristic of simple minded collections that their
negative self extensions vanish in every degree. Relaxing this to vanishing in
degrees $\{ -w+1, \ldots, -1 \}$ where $w$ is a positive integer leads to the
rich, parallel notion of $w$-simple minded systems, which have recently been
the subject of vigorous interest.
  If $\mathcal{S}$ is a $w$-simple minded system for some $w \geqslant 2$, then
$\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$ is typically not the heart of a $t$-structure.
Nevertheless, using different methods, we will prove that $\langle \mathcal{S}
\rangle$ is abelian and that there is a tilting theory for such abelian
subcategories. Our theory is based on Quillen's notion of exact categories, in
particular a theorem by Dyer which provides exact subcategories of triangulated
categories.
  The theory of simple minded systems can be viewed as ""negative cluster
tilting theory"". In particular, the result that $\langle \mathcal{S} \rangle$
is an abelian subcategory is a negative counterpart to the result from (higher)
positive cluster tilting theory that if $\mathcal{T}$ is a cluster tilting
subcategory, then $( \mathcal{T} * \Sigma \mathcal{T} )/[ \mathcal{T} ]$ is an
abelian quotient category.

improvements to the secular tidal evolution of TRAPPIST-1e and the early
history of Pluto-Charon under the simplifying assumption of homogeneous bodies.
By including higher-order eccentricity terms (up to and including $e^{20}$), we
find divergences from the traditionally used $e^{2}$ truncation starting around
$e=0.1$. Order-of-magnitude differences begin to occur for $e>0.6$. Critically,
higher-order eccentricity terms activate additional spin-orbit resonances.
Worlds experiencing non-synchronous rotation can fall into and out of these
resonances, altering their long-term evolution. Non-zero obliquity generally
does not generate significantly higher heating; however, it can considerably
alter orbital and rotational evolution. Much like eccentricity, obliquity can
activate new tidal modes and resonances. Tracking the dual-body dissipation
within Pluto and Charon leads to faster evolution and dramatically different
orbital outcomes. Based on our findings, we recommend future tidal studies on
worlds with $e\geq0.3$ to take into account additional eccentricity terms
beyond $e^{2}$. This threshold should be lowered to $e>0.1$ if non-synchronous
rotation or non-zero obliquity is under consideration. Due to the poor
convergence of the eccentricity functions, studies on worlds that may
experience very high eccentricity ($e\geq0.6$) should include terms with high
powers of eccentricity. We provide these equations up to $e^{10}$ for arbitrary
obliquity and non-synchronous rotation. Finally, the assumption that
short-period, solid-body exoplanets with $e\gtrsim0.1$ are tidally locked in
their 1:1 spin-orbit resonance should be reconsidered. Higher-order spin-orbit
resonances can exist even at these relatively modest eccentricities, while
previous studies have found such resonances can significantly alter
stellar-driven climate.

within the input audio. In an experiment on multi-person speaker identification
using synthesized LibriSpeech data, the proposed method outperforms traditional
embedding methods that are only trained to separate single speakers (not
speaker sets). In a speaker diarization experiment on the AMI Headset Mix

which has an impact on intermolecular interactions, spectroscopic observables,

involves an infinite sum over all excited (bound and continuum) states,
concealing the physical interpretation of polarization mechanisms and
complicating the derivation of efficient response models. Approximate
expressions for the dipole polarizability, $\alpha$, rely on different scaling
laws $\alpha \propto$ $R^3$, $R^4$, or $R^7$, for various definitions of the

demonstrating that their polarizability follows a universal four-dimensional
scaling law $\alpha = C (4 \mu q^2/\hbar^2)L^4$, where $\mu$ and $q$ are the
(effective) particle mass and charge, $C$ is a dimensionless excitation-energy
ratio, and the characteristic length $L$ is defined via the
$\mathcal{L}^2$-norm of the position operator. %The applicability of this

performance for predicting the responses of neurons in the visual cortex to
natural stimuli. However, they require a time consuming parameter optimization
process for accurately modeling the tuning function of newly observed neurons,
which prohibits many applications including real-time, closed-loop experiments.
We overcome this limitation by formulating the problem as $K$-shot prediction
to directly infer a neuron's tuning function from a small set of
stimulus-response pairs using a Neural Process. This required us to developed a
Factorized Neural Process, which embeds the observed set into a latent space
partitioned into the receptive field location and the tuning function
properties. We show on simulated responses that the predictions and
reconstructed receptive fields from the Factorized Neural Process approach
ground truth with increasing number of trials. Critically, the latent
representation that summarizes the tuning function of a neuron is inferred in a
quick, single forward pass through the network. Finally, we validate this
approach on real neural data from visual cortex and find that the predictive
accuracy is comparable to -- and for small $K$ even greater than --
optimization based approaches, while being substantially faster. We believe
this novel deep learning systems identification framework will facilitate
better real-time integration of artificial neural network modeling into
neuroscience experiments.

reconstruction of their evolution. However, the current measurements of the
stellar kinematics are complicated by several factors, including dust
extinction and the presence of multiple stellar populations. We use integral
field spectroscopic data of four galaxies from the TIMER survey to explore and
compare the kinematics measured in different spectral regions that are
sensitive to distinct stellar populations. We derive the line-of-sight velocity
and velocity dispersion of both a young (<2 Gyr) and an old stellar population
from the spectral regions around the H$\beta$ line and the Ca II Triplet. In
addition we obtain colour excess, mean age, and metallicity. We report a
correlation of the colour excess with the difference in the kinematic
parameters of the H$\beta$ line and the Ca II Triplet range, which are
dominated by young and old stellar populations, respectively. Young stellar
populations, located primarily in nuclear rings, have higher velocity
dispersions than old ones. These differences in the rings are typically 10 km/s
in velocity dispersion, but up to a mean value of 24 km/s in the most extreme
case. Trends with age exist in the nuclear rings but are less significant than
those with dust extinction. We report different degrees of correlation of these
trends among the galaxies in the sample, which are related to the size of the
Voronoi bins in their rings. No clear trends for the difference of
line-of-sight velocity are observed. The absence of these trends can be
explained as a consequence of the masking process of the H$\beta$ line during
the kinematic extraction, as confirmed by dedicated simulations. Our study
demonstrates that kinematic differences caused by different stellar populations
can be identified in the central regions of nearby galaxies even from
intermediate resolution spectroscopy.

The method uses an iterative Dijkstra's algorithm, a strategic node selection,
and a novel cost matrix formulation based on intensity peak prominence and is
thus termed the ""Prominence Iterative Dijkstra's"" algorithm, or ProID. Although
the current analysis focuses on the left ventricle (LV), ProID is applicable to
all four heart chambers. ProID was tested using artificial echo images
representing five different systems. Results showed accurate LV contours and
volume estimations as compared to the ground-truth for all systems.
Subsequently, ProID was used to analyze a clinical cohort of 66 pediatric
patients, including both normal and diseased hearts. Output segmentations,
end-diastolic, end-systolic volumes, and ejection fraction (EF) were compared
against manual segmentations from two expert readers. ProID maintained an
average Dice similarity score of 0.93 when comparing against manual
segmentation. Comparing the two expert readers, the manual segmentations
maintained a score of 0.93, which increased to 0.95 when they used ProID. Thus,
ProID successfully reduced the inter-operator variability across the two expert
readers. Overall, this work demonstrates that ProID yields accurate boundaries
across all age groups, disease states, and echo platforms with low computation
cost, thereby establishing its clinical usefulness.

semantic parsing, they fail at compositional generalization, i.e., they are
unable to systematically generalize to unseen compositions of seen components.
Motivated by traditional semantic parsing where compositionality is explicitly
accounted for by symbolic grammars, we propose a new decoding framework that
preserves the expressivity and generality of sequence-to-sequence models while
featuring lexicon-style alignments and disentangled information processing.
Specifically, we decompose decoding into two phases where an input utterance is
first tagged with semantic symbols representing the meaning of individual
words, and then a sequence-to-sequence model is used to predict the final
meaning representation conditioning on the utterance and the predicted tag
sequence. Experimental results on three semantic parsing datasets show that the
proposed approach consistently improves compositional generalization across
model architectures, domains, and semantic formalisms.

allows a flexible post-training hyper-parameter to be efficiently tuned on a

demonstrating that our method can deal with both problems in a unified way. The
resulting algorithm can be conveniently used on probabilistic classification
problems agnostic to underlying architectures. Our results on six different

on large-scale imbalanced datasets such as iNaturalist for classification and

driven by human activity and amplified by increasing climatic variability.
Properly managing these impacts relies on a government's ability to ensure
environmental regulatory compliance in the face of increasing uncertainty.
Water flow rates are the most widely used evaluation metric for river
regulatory compliance. Specifically, compliance thresholds are set by
calculating the minimum flow rates required by aquatic species such as fish.
These are then designated as the minimum ""environmental flows"" (eflows) for
each river. In this paper, we explore how IoT-generated open government data
can be used to enhance the development of an automated IoT-based eflows
compliance system. To reduce development and operational costs, the proposed
solution relies on routinely collected river monitoring data. Our approach
allows for any authority with similar data to rapidly develop, test and verify
a scalable solution for eflow regulatory compliance monitoring and evaluation.
Furthermore, we demonstrate a real-world application of our system using open
government data from Estonia's national river monitoring network. The main
novelty of this work is that the proposed IoT-based system provides a simple
evaluation tool that re-purposes IoT-generated open government data to evaluate
compliance and improve monitoring at a national scale. This work showcases a
new paradigm of IoT-based solutions using open government data and provides a
real-world example of how the solution can automatically evaluate environmental
compliance in increasingly uncertain environments.

must incur private cost to benefit or protect others. Using self-reported data

community compliance can predict changes in individual compliance behavior,
controlling for the potential confounders. We observe statistically significant
and positive relationship between the two, even after accounting for omitted
variable bias, plausibly allowing us to view the results from a plausible
causal lens. Further, we find subsequent lockdowns such as the ones imposed in
India, have a detrimental effect on individual compliance though the gains from
higher perceived community compliance seems to offset this loss. We also find
that sensitization through community can be particularly effective for people
with pre-existing co-morbidities. Our findings underscore the need for
multi-level behavioral interventions involving local actors and community

comprehensively study the two types of transient waves, constituting the
experimental part of the power system transient and stability course. In this
approach, three models with different levels of complexity are developed to
simultaneously show the two types of transient waves in the time domain. The
developed models are then demonstrated as testbeds for investigating various
aspects related to the two types of transient, such as waveforms induced by
different disturbances, influencing factors on the propagation speed, and the
interaction between incident waves and the reflective waves. In addition, a
theory-to-practice engineering research process is demonstrated through
developing a power system event-location application, which is inspired by
electromechanical wave propagation study. The proposed education process and
models at various complexity levels provide a creative and interactive way for
power system transients and dynamics study.

  models: Application to lymphatic filariasis in East Africa","48 pages",,,,"stat.AP stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Infectious diseases remain one of the major causes of human mortality and
suffering. Mathematical models have been established as an important tool for
capturing the features that drive the spread of the disease, predicting the
progression of an epidemic and hence guiding the development of strategies to
control it. Another important area of epidemiological interest is the
development of geostatistical methods for the analysis of data from spatially
referenced prevalence surveys. Maps of prevalence are useful, not only for
enabling a more precise disease risk stratification, but also for guiding the
planning of more reliable spatial control programmes by identifying affected
areas. Despite the methodological advances that have been made in each area
independently, efforts to link transmission models and geostatistical maps have
been limited. Motivated by this fact, we developed a Bayesian approach that
combines fine-scale geostatistical maps of disease prevalence with transmission
models to provide quantitative, spatially explicit projections of the current
and future impact of control programs against a disease. These estimates can
then be used at a local level to identify the effectiveness of suggested
intervention schemes and allow investigation of alternative strategies. The
methodology has been applied to lymphatic filariasis in East Africa to provide
estimates of the impact of different intervention strategies against the
disease.

correlated optimization problems to generate efficient machine code. Current ML

Existing learning based approaches in the literature are sample inefficient,
tackle a single optimization problem, and do not generalize to unseen graphs

sequential attention mechanism over an inductive graph neural network. GO
generates decisions on the entire graph rather than on each individual node
autoregressively, drastically speeding up the search compared to prior methods.
Moreover, we propose recurrent attention layers to jointly optimize dependent
graph optimization tasks and demonstrate 33%-60% speedup on three graph
optimization tasks compared to TensorFlow default optimization. On a diverse
set of representative graphs consisting of up to 80,000 nodes, including
Inception-v3, Transformer-XL, and WaveNet, GO achieves on average 21%

identify or predict with high probability. In the domain of chess problem
composition, the same is true. Traditional machine learning approaches tend to
focus on the ability of computers to process massive amounts of data and
continuously adjust 'weights' within an artificial neural network to better
distinguish between say, two groups of objects. Contrasted with chess
compositions, there is no clear distinction between what constitutes one and
what does not; even less so between a good one and a poor one. We propose a
computational method that is able to learn from existing databases of 'liked'
and 'disliked' compositions such that a new and unseen collection can be sorted
with increased probability of matching a solver's preferences. The method uses
a simple 'change factor' relating to the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) of each
composition's starting position, coupled with repeated statistical analysis of
sample pairs from both databases. Tested using the author's own collections of
computer-generated chess problems, the experimental results showed that the
method was able to sort a new and unseen collection of compositions such that,
on average, over 70% of the preferred compositions were in the top half of the
collection. This saves significant time and energy on the part of solvers as
they are likely to find more of what they like sooner. The method may even be
applicable to other domains such as image processing because it does not rely
on any chess-specific rules but rather just a sufficient and quantifiable
'change' in representation from one object to the next.

scattering problems of two particles which interact both electromagnetically

former interaction is modeled via the minimal coupling prescription while the
latter enters via an external potential. We also formulate logically consistent
classical and quantum field theories associated with these Lorentz covariant

invariance, we show that the present theories imply that particles and

has been an active area of research for a long time. While on one side, the
supporters of the efficient market hypothesis claim that it is impossible to
forecast stock prices accurately, many researchers believe otherwise. There
exist propositions in the literature that have demonstrated that if properly
designed and optimized, predictive models can very accurately and reliably
predict future values of stock prices. This paper presents a suite of deep
learning based models for stock price prediction. We use the historical records
of the NIFTY 50 index listed in the National Stock Exchange of India, during
the period from December 29, 2008 to July 31, 2020, for training and testing
the models. Our proposition includes two regression models built on
convolutional neural networks and three long and short term memory network
based predictive models. To forecast the open values of the NIFTY 50 index
records, we adopted a multi step prediction technique with walk forward
validation. In this approach, the open values of the NIFTY 50 index are
predicted on a time horizon of one week, and once a week is over, the actual
index values are included in the training set before the model is trained
again, and the forecasts for the next week are made. We present detailed
results on the forecasting accuracies for all our proposed models. The results
show that while all the models are very accurate in forecasting the NIFTY 50
open values, the univariate encoder decoder convolutional LSTM with the
previous two weeks data as the input is the most accurate model. On the other
hand, a univariate CNN model with previous one week data as the input is found
to be the fastest model in terms of its execution speed.

  Access",,"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3066101",,"math.DS math.OC nlin.CD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Periodic orbits are among the simplest non-equilibrium solutions to dynamical
systems, and they play a significant role in our modern understanding of the
rich structures observed in many systems. For example, it is known that
embedded within any chaotic attractor are infinitely many unstable periodic
orbits (UPOs) and so a chaotic trajectory can be thought of as `jumping' from
one UPO to another in a seemingly unpredictable manner. A number of studies
have sought to exploit the existence of these UPOs to control a chaotic system.
These methods rely on introducing small, precise parameter manipulations each
time the trajectory crosses a transverse section to the flow. Typically these
methods suffer from the fact that they require a precise description of the
Poincar\'e mapping for the flow, which is a difficult task since there is no
systematic way of producing such a mapping associated to a given system. Here
we employ recent model discovery methods for producing accurate and
parsimonious parameter-dependent Poincar\'e mappings to stabilize UPOs in
nonlinear dynamical systems. Specifically, we use the sparse identification of
nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method to frame model discovery as a sparse
regression problem, which can be implemented in a computationally efficient
manner. This approach provides an explicit Poincar\'e mapping that faithfully
describes the dynamics of the flow in the Poincar\'e section and can be used to
identify UPOs. For each UPO, we then determine the parameter manipulations that
stabilize this orbit. The utility of these methods are demonstrated on a
variety of differential equations, including the R\""ossler system in a chaotic
parameter regime.

include electron interactions with the four DNA bases using a set of cross
sections recently implemented in Geant-DNA CPA100 models and available for
liquid water. Electron interaction cross sections for elastic scattering,
ionisation, and electronic excitation were calculated in the four DNA bases
adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine. The electron energy range is extended
to include relativistic electrons. Elastic scattering cross sections were
calculated using the independent atom model with amplitude derived from ELSEPA
code. Relativistic Binary Encounter Bethe Vriens model was used to calculate
ionisation cross sections. The electronic excitation cross sections
calculations were based on the water cross sections following the same strategy
used in CPA100 code. These were implemented within the Geant4-DNA option6
physics constructor to extend its capability of tracking electrons in DNA
material in addition to liquid water. Since DNA nucleobases have different
molecular structure than water it is important to perform more accurate
simulations especially because DNA is considered the most radiosensitive
structure in cells. Differential and integrated cross sections calculations
were in good agreement with data from the literature for all DNA bases.
Stopping power, range and inelastic mean free path calculations in the four DNA
bases using this new extension of Geant4-DNA option6 are in good agreement with
calculations done by other studies, especially for high energy electrons. Some
deviations are shown at the low electron energy range, which could be
attributed to the different interaction models. Comparison with water
simulations shows obvious difference which emphasizes the need to include DNA
bases cross sections in track structure codes for better estimation of
radiation effects on biological material.

  Artificial Intelligence Research","52 pages,13 figures",,,,"cs.CY cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Increasingly, modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) research has become more
computationally intensive. However, a growing concern is that due to unequal
access to computing power, only certain firms and elite universities have
advantages in modern AI research. Using a novel dataset of 171394 papers from
57 prestigious computer science conferences, we document that firms, in
particular, large technology firms and elite universities have increased
participation in major AI conferences since deep learning's unanticipated rise
in 2012. The effect is concentrated among elite universities, which are ranked
1-50 in the QS World University Rankings. Further, we find two strategies
through which firms increased their presence in AI research: first, they have
increased firm-only publications; and second, firms are collaborating primarily
with elite universities. Consequently, this increased presence of firms and
elite universities in AI research has crowded out mid-tier (QS ranked 201-300)
and lower-tier (QS ranked 301-500) universities. To provide causal evidence
that deep learning's unanticipated rise resulted in this divergence, we
leverage the generalized synthetic control method, a data-driven counterfactual
estimator. Using machine learning based text analysis methods, we provide
additional evidence that the divergence between these two groups - large firms
and non-elite universities - is driven by access to computing power or compute,
which we term as the ""compute divide"". This compute divide between large firms
and non-elite universities increases concerns around bias and fairness within
AI technology, and presents an obstacle towards ""democratizing"" AI. These
results suggest that a lack of access to specialized equipment such as compute
can de-democratize knowledge production.

traffic accidents are distributed in time and space, and the severity level of
traffic accidents that both involve and do not involve other transportation
modes (e.g., pedestrians and motorists). We have made the following
observations: 1) the pandemic has disproportionately affected certain age
groups, races, and genders; 2) the ""hotspots"" of traffic accidents have been
shifted in both time and space compared to time periods that are prior to the
pandemic, demonstrating irregularity; and 3) the number of non-fatal accident
cases has decreased but the number of severe and fatal cases of traffic
accidents remains the same under the pandemic.

expected number of state-changes in a growing self-organizing process. With
this problem in mind, we examine two versions of the voter model on a
one-dimensional growing lattice. Our main result asserts that the expected
number of state-changes before an absorbing state is found can be controlled by
balancing the conservative and disruptive forces of growth. This is because
conservative growth preserves the self-organization of the voter model as it
searches for an absorbing state, whereas disruptive growth undermines this
self-organization. In particular, we focus on controlling the expected number
of state-changes as the rate of growth tends to zero or infinity in the limit.
These results illustrate how growth can affect the costs of self-organization
and so are pertinent to the physics of growing active matter.

structure of input language could lead to generalization problems and
over-parametrization. In the present work, we propose a new syntax-aware
language model: Syntactic Ordered Memory (SOM). The model explicitly models the
structure with an incremental parser and maintains the conditional probability
setting of a standard language model (left-to-right). To train the incremental
parser and avoid exposure bias, we also propose a novel dynamic oracle, so that
SOM is more robust to wrong parsing decisions. Experiments show that SOM can
achieve strong results in language modeling, incremental parsing and syntactic
generalization tests, while using fewer parameters than other models.

without considering the computational social aspects. However, end-users are
playing a key role in their operation and response to disturbances via demand
response and distributed energy resources. Therefore, due to the critical role
of active and passive end-users and the intermittency of renewable energy,
smart grids must be planned and operated by considering the computational
social aspects in addition to the technical aspects. The level of cooperation,
flexibility, and other social features of the various stakeholders, including
consumers, prosumers, and microgrids, affect the system efficiency,
reliability, and resilience. In this paper, we design an artificial society
simulating the interaction between power systems and the social communities
that they serve via agent-based modeling inspired by Barsade's theory on the
emotional spread. The simulation results show a decline in the consumers' and
prosumers' satisfaction levels induced by a shortage of electricity. It also
shows the effects of social diffusion via the Internet and mass media on the
satisfaction level. In view of the importance of computational social science
for power system applications and the limited number of publications devoted to
it, we provide a list of research topics that need to be achieved to enhance
the reliability and resilience of power systems' operation and planning.
