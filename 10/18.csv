  Linear Classifier Models","33 pages",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, machine learning algorithms have been applied widely in
various fields such as health, transportation, and the autonomous car. With the
rapid developments of deep learning techniques, it is critical to take the
security concern into account for the application of the algorithms. While
machine learning offers significant advantages in terms of the application of
algorithms, the issue of security is ignored. Since it has many applications in
the real world, security is a vital part of the algorithms. In this paper, we
have proposed a mitigation method for adversarial attacks against machine
learning models with an autoencoder model that is one of the generative ones.
The main idea behind adversarial attacks against machine learning models is to
produce erroneous results by manipulating trained models. We have also
presented the performance of autoencoder models to various attack methods from
deep neural networks to traditional algorithms by using different methods such
as non-targeted and targeted attacks to multi-class logistic regression, a fast
gradient sign method, a targeted fast gradient sign method and a basic
iterative method attack to neural networks for the MNIST dataset.

silico molecule design pipeline and have dual goals of learning the chemical
and structural features that render candidate molecules viable while also being
flexible enough to generate novel designs. Specifically, Variational Auto
Encoders (VAEs) are generative models in which encoder-decoder network pairs
are trained to reconstruct training data distributions in such a way that the
latent space of the encoder network is smooth. Therefore, novel candidates can
be found by sampling from this latent space. However, the scope of
architectures and hyperparameters is vast and choosing the best combination for
in silico discovery has important implications for downstream success.
Therefore, it is important to develop a principled methodology for
distinguishing how well a given generative model is able to learn salient
molecular features. In this work, we propose a method for measuring how well
the latent space of deep generative models is able to encode structural and
chemical features of molecular datasets by correlating latent space metrics
with metrics from the field of topological data analysis (TDA). We apply our
evaluation methodology to a VAE trained on SMILES strings and show that 3D
topology information is consistently encoded throughout the latent space of the

radio bursts (FRBs). Many authors directly call the TRPs as FRB 200428 without
consider two questions carefully. (1) Are the TRPs just two brighter subpulses
of a normal radio pulse liking the normal radio pulses seen in other magnetars
during their outburst? (2) If the TRPs are two bursts of an FRB, does this make
other FRBs difficult to understand? In this paper, we try to clarify these two
questions. First, we compare these TRPs with previous observations of normal
radio pulses from pulsars and magnetars, and find that the TRPs should be
produced by different mechanism from that of normal radio pulses. We then
investigate the second question by assuming the TRPs have the same origin as
that of periodically repeating FRBs and find that the origin of the periodicity
of periodically repeating FRBs should not be induced by precession. Otherwise,
we should expect that the TRPs are not an FRB, at least the TRPs don't have the
same origin as that of periodically repeating FRBs.

performance. This paper robustly evaluates 30 different Reinforcement Learning
reward functions for controlling intersections serving pedestrians and vehicles
covering the main traffic state variables available via modern vision-based
sensors. Some rewards proposed in previous literature solely for vehicular
traffic are extended to pedestrians while new ones are introduced. We use a
calibrated model in terms of demand, sensors, green times and other operational
constraints of a real intersection in Greater Manchester, UK. The assessed
rewards can be classified in 5 groups depending on the magnitudes used: queues,
waiting time, delay, average speed and throughput in the junction. The
performance of different agents, in terms of waiting time, is compared across
different demand levels, from normal operation to saturation of traditional
adaptive controllers. We find that those rewards maximising the speed of the
network obtain the lowest waiting time for vehicles and pedestrians
simultaneously, closely followed by queue minimisation, demonstrating better
performance than other previously proposed methods.

sums to $0$. In the average-case version, the $m$ elements are chosen uniformly
at random from some interval $[-u,u]$.
  We consider the total setting where $m$ is sufficiently large (with respect
to $u$ and $k$), so that we are guaranteed (with high probability) that

to problems in computational geometry, extends to the total setting.
  The best known algorithm in the average-case total setting is due to Wagner
(following the approach of Blum-Kalai-Wasserman), and achieves a run-time of
$u^{O(1/\log k)}$. This beats the known (conditional) lower bounds for
worst-case $k$-SUM, raising the natural question of whether it can be improved
even further. However, in this work, we show a matching average-case
lower-bound, by showing a reduction from worst-case lattice problems, thus
introducing a new family of techniques into the field of fine-grained

of the plots and characters throughout the story. Previous works have shown
that GPT2, a large-scale language model, has achieved good performance on story
generation. However, we observe that several serious issues still exist in the
stories generated by GPT2 which can be categorized into two folds: consistency
and coherency. In terms of consistency, on one hand, GPT2 cannot guarantee the
consistency of the plots explicitly. On the other hand, the generated stories
usually contain coreference errors. In terms of coherency, GPT2 does not take
account of the discourse relations between sentences of stories directly. To
enhance the consistency and coherency of the generated stories, we propose a
two-stage generation framework, where the first stage is to organize the story
outline which depicts the story plots and events, and the second stage is to
expand the outline into a complete story. Therefore the plots consistency can
be controlled and guaranteed explicitly. In addition, coreference supervision
signals are incorporated to reduce coreference errors and improve the
coreference consistency. Moreover, we design an auxiliary task of discourse
relation modeling to improve the coherency of the generated stories.
Experimental results on a story dataset show that our model outperforms the
baseline approaches in terms of both automatic metrics and human evaluation.

this decay on CMB. We find that helical magnetic fields lead to changes in the
evolution of baryon temperature and ionization fraction which in turn lead to
modifications in the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropy. These
modifications are different from those arising due to non-helical magnetic
fields with the changes dependent on the strength and the spectral index of the
magnetic field power spectra.

  arXiv:2006.01734",,,,"hep-th gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The quantum field theoretic description of general relativity is a modern
approach to gravity where gravitational force is carried by spin-2 gravitons.
In the classical limit of this theory, general relativity as described by the
Einstein field equations is obtained. This limit, where classical general
relativity is derived from quantum field theory is the topic of this thesis.
  The Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric, which describes the gravitational field
of an inertial point particle in arbitrary space-time dimensions, $D$, is
analyzed. The metric is related to the three-point vertex function of a massive
scalar interacting with a graviton to all orders in $G_N$, and the one-loop
contribution to this amplitude is computed from which the $G_N^2$ contribution
to the metric is derived.
  To understand the gauge-dependence of the metric, covariant gauge is used
which introduces the parameter, $\xi$, and the gauge-fixing function
$G_\sigma$. In the classical limit, the gauge-fixing function turns out to be
the coordinate condition, $G_\sigma=0$. As gauge-fixing function a novel family
of gauges, which depends on an arbitrary parameter $\alpha$ and includes both
harmonic and de Donder gauge, is used.
  Feynman rules for the graviton field are derived and important results are
the graviton propagator in covariant gauge and a general formula for the
n-graviton vertex in terms of the Einstein tensor. The Feynman rules are used
both in deriving the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric from amplitudes and in
the computation of the one-loop correction to the metric.
  The one-loop correction to the metric is independent of the covariant gauge
parameter, $\xi$, and satisfies the gauge condition $G_\sigma=0$ where
$G_\sigma$ is the family of gauges depending on $\alpha$. In space-time $D=5$ a
logarithm appears in position space and this phenomena is analyzed in terms of
redundant gauge freedom.

comparison-based data structure on the pointer machine that supports
order-based operations such as rank, select, membership, predecessor,
successor, minimum, and maximum while providing dynamic operations insert,
delete, change-key, split, and merge. We analyze the performance of our data
structure based on a partition of current elements into a set of gaps
$\{\Delta_i\}$ based on rank. A query falls into a particular gap and splits
the gap into two new gaps at a rank $r$ associated with the query operation. If
we define $B = \sum_i |\Delta_i| \log_2(n/|\Delta_i|)$, our performance over a
sequence of $n$ insertions and $q$ distinct queries is $O(B + \min(n \log \log
n, n \log q))$. We show $B$ is a lower bound.
  Effectively, we reduce the insertion time of binary search trees from
$\Theta(\log n)$ to $O(\min(\log(n/|\Delta_i|) + \log \log |\Delta_i|, \; \log
q))$, where $\Delta_i$ is the gap in which the inserted element falls. Over a
sequence of $n$ insertions and $q$ queries, a time bound of $O(n \log q + q
\log n)$ holds; better bounds are possible when queries are non-uniformly
distributed. As an extreme case of non-uniformity, if all queries are for the
minimum element, the lazy search tree performs as a priority queue with $O(\log
\log n)$ time insert and decrease-key operations. The same data structure
supports queries for any rank, interpolating between binary search trees and
efficient priority queues.
  Lazy search trees can be implemented to operate mostly on arrays, requiring
only $O(\min(q, n))$ pointers. Via direct reduction, our data structure also
supports the efficient access theorems of the splay tree, providing a powerful
data structure for non-uniform element access, both when the number of accesses
is small and large.

modifying the driving environment, which then impacts the video inputs to the

Such attacks require accounting for system dynamics and tracking viewpoint

Given the parameters of the rectangles, our proposed differentiable mapping
composites them onto pre-recorded video streams of the original environment,
accounting for geometric and color variations. Moreover, we propose a multiple
trajectory sampling approach that enables our attacks to be robust to a car's
self-correcting behavior. When combined with a neural network-based controller,
our approach allows the design of adversarial modifications through end-to-end

our fleet of floor-cleaning robots. Jitter in the robot's sensed raw map,
dynamic objects in the environment, and exploration of new space by the robot
are common challenges for robots. Solving these challenges effectively in the
context of semantic maps is key to enabling semantic maps for lifelong mapping.
First, as a robot senses new changes and alters its raw map in successive runs,
the semantics must be updated appropriately. We update the map using a spatial
transfer of semantics. Second, it is important to keep semantics and their
relative constraints consistent even in the presence of dynamic objects.
Inconsistencies are automatically determined and resolved through the
introduction of a map layer of meta-semantics. Finally, a discovery phase
allows the semantic map to be updated with new semantics whenever the robot
uncovers new information. Deployed commercially on thousands of floor-cleaning
robots in real homes, our user-facing semantic maps provide a intuitive user

$\gamma$-ensembles. It enables us to numerically compute the eigenvalue density
of $\gamma$-ensembles for all $\gamma > 0$. We show that one important effect
of the two-particle interaction parameter $\gamma$ is to generate or enhance
the non-monotonicity in the effective single-particle potential. For suitable
choices of the initial single-particle potentials, reducing $\gamma$ can lead
to a large non-monotonicity in the effective potential, which in turn leads to
significant changes in the density of eigenvalues. For a disordered conductor,
this corresponds to a systematic decrease in the conductance with increasing
disorder. This suggests that appropriate models of $\gamma$-ensembles can be
used as a possible framework to study the effects of disorder on the
distribution of conductances.

over $\mathbf{Z}$ and rings with similar properties: rings of integers of
number fields, discrete valuation rings, hybrid fields, etc. We focus on three
main themes that had not been investigated so far: category, topology and
cohomology. As regards the category, our main task is to define a well-behaved
notion of morphism. We then have the suitable setting at our disposal to carry
out and study various constructions: products, fiber products, extensions of
scalars, analytification of schemes, etc. On the topological side, we show that
Berkovich spaces over $\mathbf{Z}$ are locally path-connected. The main
ingredient is an analogue of Noether's normalization lemma, that we obtain
after a careful study of finite morphisms. Finally, we prove that open and
closed discs of arbitrary dimension have no higher coherent cohomology. This
allows us to initiate a theory of overconvergent affinoid domains over
$\mathbf{Z}$, where the analogues of Tate's and Kiehl's theorems hold. As a
consequence of our vanishing statements, we obtain a geometric proof of a
Noetherianity result for certain rings of convergent arithmetic power series

convergence), generalizing a theorem of D. Harbater from the case of a single

intervals and assessing p-values in statistical inference for high-dimensional

inference problem into a series of low-dimensional inference problems: For each
regression coefficient $\beta_i$, the confidence interval and $p$-value are
computed by regressing on a subset of variables selected according to the
conditional independence relations between the corresponding variable $X_i$ and
other variables. Since the subset of variables forms a Markov neighborhood of
$X_i$ in the Markov network formed by all the variables $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_p$,
the proposed method is coined as Markov neighborhood regression. The proposed
method is tested on high-dimensional linear, logistic and Cox regression. The
numerical results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms
the existing ones. Based on the Markov neighborhood regression, a method of
learning causal structures for high-dimensional linear models is proposed and
applied to identification of drug sensitive genes and cancer driver genes. The
idea of using conditional independence relations for dimension reduction is
general and potentially can be extended to other high-dimensional or big data
problems as well.

approaches, where the scope of a model is limited to a specific family of tasks

leverages causal link analysis and backwards reachability over state variables

independently by four radiologist experts as positive or negative for

of the dataset by measuring the AUC, sensitivity, and specificity for each

identifying radiographs with pneumoperitoneum, while DenseNet161 achieved the

treatments an operational meaning, yet its theoretical foundation defies the

result of potentially an infinite number of attributes (hence $p=\infty$),

index the degree of approximation to ultimate individuality. MR inference seeks
a primary resolution indexing an indirect training sample, which provides
enough matched attributes to increase the relevance of the results to the
target individuals and yet still accumulate sufficient indirect sample sizes
for robust estimation. Theoretically, MR inference relies on an infinite-term
ANOVA-type decomposition, providing an alternative way to model sparsity via
the decay rate of the resolution bias as a function of the primary resolution
level. Unexpectedly, this decomposition reveals a world without variance when
the outcome is a deterministic function of potentially infinitely many
predictors. In this deterministic world, the optimal resolution prefers
over-fitting in the traditional sense when the resolution bias decays
sufficiently rapidly. Furthermore, there can be many ""descents"" in the
prediction error curve, when the contributions of predictors are inhomogeneous
and the ordering of their importance does not align with the order of their
inclusion in prediction.

Bursts (LGRBs) with and without radio afterglow emission, corresponding to
radio-bright/loud and radio-dark/quiet populations, has been recently argued
and favored in the GRB literature. The radio-quiet LGRBs have been found to
have, on average, lower total isotropic gamma-ray emissions (Eiso) and shorter
intrinsic prompt gamma-ray duration (e.g., T90z). In addition, a redshift-T90z
anti-correlation has been discovered among the radio-loud LGRBs, which is
reportedly missing in the radio-quiet class.
  Here we discuss the significance of the differences between the energetics
and temporal properties of the two proposed classes of radio-loud and
radio-quiet LGRBs. We show that much of the proposed evidence in support of the
two distinct radio populations of LGRBs can be explained away in terms of
selection effects and sample incompleteness. Our arguments are based on the
recent discovery of the relatively-strong highly-significant positive
correlation between the total isotropic emission (Eiso) and the intrinsic

long-soft GRBs, predicted, quantified, and reported for the first time by

provide a reasonable ""natural"" explanation for why Betelgeuse has a large, but
sub-Keplerian equatorial velocity. They eject sufficient mass and angular
momentum in rotationally-induced mass loss to reproduce the observed ratio of
the equatorial velocity to escape velocity of Betelgeuse, ~0.23, within a
factor of three nearly independent of the primary mass, the secondary mass, and
the epoch at which merger occurs. Our models suggest that merger of a primary
of somewhat less than 15 solar masses with secondaries of from 1 to 10 solar
masses during core helium burning or core carbon burning could yield the
equatorial rotational velocity of ~15 km/s attributed to Betelgeuse. For
accreting models, a wave of angular momentum is halted at the composition
boundary at the edge of the helium core. The inner core is thus not affected by
the accretion of the companion in these simulations. Accretion has relatively
little effect on the production of magnetic fields in the inner core. Our
results do not prove, but do not negate that Betelgeuse might have ingested a

Knowledge Base Question Answering is one of the promising approaches for
extracting substantial knowledge from Knowledge Bases. Unlike web search,
Question Answering over a knowledge base gives accurate and concise results,
provided that natural language questions can be understood and mapped precisely
to an answer in the knowledge base. However, some of the existing
embedding-based methods for knowledge base question answering systems ignore
the subtle correlation between the question and the Knowledge Base (e.g.,
entity types, relation paths, and context) and suffer from the Out Of
Vocabulary problem. In this paper, we focused on using a pre-trained language
model for the Knowledge Base Question Answering task. Firstly, we used Bert
base uncased for the initial experiments. We further fine-tuned these
embeddings with a two-way attention mechanism from the knowledge base to the
asked question and from the asked question to the knowledge base answer
aspects. Our method is based on a simple Convolutional Neural Network
architecture with a Multi-Head Attention mechanism to represent the asked
question dynamically in multiple aspects. Our experimental results show the
effectiveness and the superiority of the Bert pre-trained language model
embeddings for question answering systems on knowledge bases over other

high-dimensional signal may be recovered from random, under-determined, and
corrupted linear measurements. Generalized Lasso (GL) programs are effective
for solving GCS problems due to their proven ability to leverage underlying
signal structure. Three popular GL programs are equivalent in a sense and
sometimes used interchangeably. Tuned by a governing parameter, each admit an
optimal parameter choice. For sparse or low-rank signal structures, this choice
yields minimax order-optimal error. While GCS is well-studied, existing theory
for GL programs typically concerns this optimally tuned setting. However, the
optimal parameter value for a GL program depends on properties of the data, and
is typically unknown in practical settings. Performance in empirical problems
thus hinges on a program's parameter sensitivity: it is desirable that small
variation about the optimal parameter choice begets small variation about the
optimal risk. We examine the risk for these three programs and demonstrate that
their parameter sensitivity can differ for the same data. We prove a
gauge-constrained GL program admits asymptotic cusp-like behaviour of its risk
in the limiting low-noise regime. We prove that a residual-constrained Lasso
program has asymptotically suboptimal risk for very sparse vectors. These
results contrast observations about an unconstrained Lasso program, which is
relatively less sensitive to its parameter choice. We support the asymptotic
theory with numerical simulations, demonstrating that parameter sensitivity of
GL programs is readily observed for even modest dimensional parameters.
Importantly, these simulations demonstrate regimes in which a GL program
exhibits sensitivity to its parameter choice, though the other two do not. We
hope this work aids practitioners in selecting a GL program for their problem.

decades, primarily to enable the relighting of human faces. By capturing the
appearance of the human subject under different light sources, one obtains the
light transport matrix of that subject, which enables image-based relighting in
novel environments. However, due to the finite number of lights in the stage,
the light transport matrix only represents a sparse sampling on the entire
sphere. As a consequence, relighting the subject with a point light or a
directional source that does not coincide exactly with one of the lights in the
stage requires interpolation and resampling the images corresponding to nearby
lights, and this leads to ghosting shadows, aliased specularities, and other
artifacts. To ameliorate these artifacts and produce better results under
arbitrary high-frequency lighting, this paper proposes a learning-based
solution for the ""super-resolution"" of scans of human faces taken from a light
stage. Given an arbitrary ""query"" light direction, our method aggregates the
captured images corresponding to neighboring lights in the stage, and uses a
neural network to synthesize a rendering of the face that appears to be
illuminated by a ""virtual"" light source at the query location. This neural
network must circumvent the inherent aliasing and regularity of the light stage
data that was used for training, which we accomplish through the use of
regularized traditional interpolation methods within our network. Our learned
model is able to produce renderings for arbitrary light directions that exhibit
realistic shadows and specular highlights, and is able to generalize across a
wide variety of subjects.

calculated by the Change-Point Analysis method, and a rigorous evaluation of
the statistical significance of the results. Using this algorithm, we have
identified particular patterns in the temporal co-evolution of the different

way, not only between time periods of uniscaling and multiscaling, but also
among different types of multiscaling: symmetric multiscaling (M) and
asymmetric multiscaling (A). We apply the visual methodology to time-series
comprising of daily close prices of four stock market indices: two major ones
(S\&P~500 and NIKKEI) and two peripheral ones (Athens Stock Exchange general
Index and Bombay-SENSEX). Results show that multiscaling varies greatly with
time: time periods of strong multiscaling behavior and time periods of
uniscaling behavior are interchanged while transitions from uniscaling to
multiscaling behavior occur before critical market events, such as stock market
bubbles. Moreover, particular asymmetric multiscaling patterns appear during
critical stock market eras and provide useful information about market
conditions. In particular, they can be used as 'fingerprints' of a turbulent

learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution.
Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods
which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new
neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier

experiments on Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The
Fourier neural operator is the first ML-based method to successfully model
turbulent flows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of

superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under fixed

The threshold is updated only once every few thousand iterations to reduce the

incorporates a novel technique to compress the activations and gradients sent
across the network during the forward and backward propagation, respectively.
This is done by identifying and updating only the most relevant neurons of the

publicly available natural language processing and recommender models and

reduces communication by at least $100\times$ and $20\times$ during DP and MP,

the knowledge of phonon-dislocation scattering but also shows the potential to

the assumption that the transverse wave function and the gap between the

this method also ignores the effect of Landau level mixing. We develop in this
work a three-dimensional fixed phase Monte Carlo method, which gives, in a
single framework, the total energies of various candidate states in a finite
width quantum well, including Landau level mixing, directly in a large magnetic

two-component states in the limit where the symmetric and antisymmetric bands
are nearly degenerate. Our three-dimensional fixed-phase diffusion Monte Carlo
calculations suggest that the observed 1/2 fractional quantum Hall state in
wide quantum wells is likely to be the one-component Pfaffian state supporting
non-Abelian excitations. We hope that this will motivate further experimental

ones with a CycleGANbased EEG disguising model. With the constraints added to
the model, the features of interest in EEG signals can be preserved. We
evaluate the model by performing classification tasks on both the original and
the disguised EEG and compare the results. For evaluation, we also experiment

excitations in certain strongly interacting systems either cannot move at all

not couple to each other and the theory describes a decoupled stack of 2+1D
fractional Quantum Hall systems with quasi-particles moving only in 2D planes
-- hence a fractonic system. We find that when the component gauge fields do
couple through the CS term, more varieties of fractonic orders are possible.
For example, they may describe foliated fractonic systems for which increasing
the system size requires insertion of nontrivial 2+1D topological states.
Moreover, we find examples which lie beyond the foliation framework,
characterized by 2D excitations of infinite order and braiding statistics that

standard Perdew-Zunger SIC (PZSIC) for both equilibrium properties such as

kinetic energy densities $\tau_\sigma$, ($z_\sigma =
\tau_\sigma^W/\tau_\sigma$) as a scaling factor to scale the self-interaction
correction. The present work further explores the LSIC method using a simpler
scaling factor as a ratio of orbital and spin densities in place of the ratio
of kinetic energy densities. We compute a wide array of both, equilibrium and
non-equilibrium properties using the LSIC and orbital scaling methods using
this simple scaling factor and compare them with previously reported results.
Our study shows that the present results with simple scaling factor are
comparable to those obtained by LSIC($z_\sigma$) for most properties but have
slightly larger errors. We furthermore study the binding energies of small
water clusters using both the scaling factors. Our results show that LSIC with
$z_{\sigma}$ has limitation in predicting the binding energies of weakly bonded

We introduce the arboricity game as a cooperative cost game defined on a graph.
The players are edges, and the cost of each coalition is the arboricity of the

an efficient algorithm for computing the nucleolus when the core is not empty.
In order to compute the nucleolus in the core, we introduce the prime partition

the edge set of a graph into a partially ordered set defined from minimal
densest minors and their invariant precedence relation. Moreover, edges from

Consequently, when the core is not empty, the prime partition significantly
reduces the number of variables and constraints required in the linear programs

Besides, the prime partition provides a graph decomposition analogous to the

paper, we examine how the presence of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)

vector is jointly optimized with the IRS phase shifts, whilst guaranteeing a
required BackCom performance. A unique feature in this system setup is the

Therefore, we propose algorithms based on the minorization-maximization and
alternating optimization techniques to obtain approximate solutions for the
joint design. We also propose low-complexity algorithms based on successive
optimization of individual phase shifts. Our results reveal considerable
transmit power savings in both single-tag and multi-tag systems, even with

stochastic agent-based model of COVID-19 intracellular dynamics is introduced
here, that incorporates essential steps of the viral life cycle targeted by
treatment options. Integration of model predictions with an intercellular ODE
model of within-host infection dynamics, fitted to patient data, generates a
generic profile of disease progression in patients that have recovered in the
absence of treatment. This is contrasted with the profiles obtained after
variation of model parameters pertinent to the immune response, such as
effector cell and antibody proliferation rates, mimicking disease progression
in immunocompromised patients. These profiles are then compared with disease
progression in the presence of antiviral and convalescent plasma therapy
against COVID-19 infections. The model reveals that using both therapies in
combination can be very effective in reducing the length of infection, but
these synergistic effects decline with a delayed treatment start. Conversely,
early treatment with either therapy alone can actually increase the duration of
infection, with infectious virions still present after the decline of other
markers of infection. This suggests that usage of these treatments should
remain carefully controlled in a clinical environment.

$q(D)$, but also can issue the $q(D_1)$ and calculate the $q(D_2)$ by
themselves as long as they know $D_2$. By different divisions of one query,
attackers can obtain multiple different answers for the query from differential
privacy mechanisms. However, from attackers' perspective and from differential
privacy mechanisms' perspective, the totally consumed privacy budget is
different if divisions are delicately designed. The difference leads to
unexpected information leakage because the privacy budget is the key parameter
to control the amount of legally released information from differential privacy
mechanisms. In order to demonstrate the unexpected information leakage, we
present a membership inference attacks against the Laplace mechanism.

which the transfer functions for several super-Gaussian sources are given a

characteristics on the evolution of collective behaviors are quite different
from each other. It is of great importance to understand the underlying
mechanisms of the occurrence of such differences. By incorporating pair pattern
strategies and reference point strategies into an agent-based model, we have
investigated the coupled effects of heterogeneous investment strategies and
heterogeneous risk tolerance on price fluctuations. In the market flooded with
the investors with homogeneous investment strategies or homogeneous risk
tolerance, large price fluctuations are easy to occur. In the market flooded
with the investors with heterogeneous investment strategies or heterogeneous
risk tolerance, the price fluctuations are suppressed. For a heterogeneous
population, the coexistence of investors with pair pattern strategies and
reference point strategies causes the price to have a slow fluctuation around a
typical equilibrium point and both a large price fluctuation and a no-trading
state are avoided, in which the pair pattern strategies push the system far
away from the equilibrium while the reference point strategies pull the system
back to the equilibrium. A theoretical analysis indicates that the evolutionary
dynamics in the present model is governed by the competition between different
strategies. The strategy that causes large price fluctuations loses more while
the strategy that pulls the system back to the equilibrium gains more.
Overfrequent trading does harm to one's pursuit for more wealth.

multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks with distributed antenna arrays
(DAAs) under correlated and uncorrelated channel fading. In DAA massive MIMO,
the base station (BS) consists of multiple antenna sub-arrays. Notably, the
antenna sub-arrays are deployed in arbitrary locations within a DAA massive
MIMO cell. Consequently, the distance-dependent large-scale propagation
coefficients are different from a user to these different antenna sub-arrays,
which makes power control a challenging problem. We assume that the network
operates in time-division duplex mode, where each BS obtains the channel
estimates via uplink pilots. Based on the channel estimates, the BSs perform
maximum-ratio transmission in the downlink. We then derive a closed-form
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) expression, where the channels
are subject to correlated fading. Based on the SINR expression, we propose a
networkwide max-min power control algorithm to ensure that each user in the
network receives a uniform quality of service. Numerical results demonstrate
the performance advantages offered by DAA massive MIMO. For some specific
scenarios, DAA massive MIMO can improve the average per-user throughput up to
55%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that channel fading covariance is an important
factor in determining the performance of DAA massive MIMO.

theories are usually constructed in duality frames which contain non-trivial
hair degrees of freedom localized outside the horizon. These modes are in
addition to the fermionic zero modes associated with broken supersymmetry.
Identifying and removing the hair from the $1/4$ BPS index allows us to isolate
the degrees of freedom associated with the horizon. The spherical symmetry of
the horizon then ensures that index of the horizon states has to be positive.
We verify that this is indeed the case for the canonical example of dyons in
type IIB theory on $K3\times T^2$ and prove this property holds for a class of
states. We generalise this observation to all CHL orbifolds, this involves
identifying the hair and isolating the horizon degrees of freedom. We then
identify the horizon states for $1/4$ BPS dyons in ${\cal N}=4$ models obtained
by freely acting ${\mathbb{Z}}_2$ and ${\mathbb{ Z}}_3$ orbifolds of type IIB
theory compactified on $T^6$ and observe that the index is again positive for
single centred black holes. This observation coupled with the fact the $1/4$
BPS index of single centred solutions without removal of the hair violates
positivity indicates that there exists no duality frame in these models without
non-trivial hair.

relations which, unlike sequences of standalone questions, need to be answered

different ""question discourse relations"" between the subparts of MSQs reflect
different speaker intents, and consequently elicit different answering

implement a high-precision baseline classifier based on surface features.

a new problem in federated learning called Federated Unsupervised
Representation Learning (FURL) to learn a common representation model without
supervision while preserving data privacy. FURL poses two new challenges: (1)
data distribution shift (Non-IID distribution) among clients would make local
models focus on different categories, leading to the inconsistency of
representation spaces. (2) without the unified information among clients in
FURL, the representations across clients would be misaligned. To address these
challenges, we propose Federated Constrastive Averaging with dictionary and
alignment (FedCA) algorithm. FedCA is composed of two key modules: (1)
dictionary module to aggregate the representations of samples from each client
and share with all clients for consistency of representation space and (2)
alignment module to align the representation of each client on a base model
trained on a public data. We adopt the contrastive loss for local model
training. Through extensive experiments with three evaluation protocols in IID

significant margins.

this work, we attempt to interpret BERT for RCQA. Since BERT layers do not have
predefined roles, we define a layer's role or functionality using Integrated
Gradients. Based on the defined roles, we perform a preliminary analysis across
all layers. We observed that the initial layers focus on query-passage
interaction, whereas later layers focus more on contextual understanding and
enhancing the answer prediction. Specifically for quantifier questions (how
much/how many), we notice that BERT focuses on confusing words (i.e., on other
numerical quantities in the passage) in the later layers, but still manages to
predict the answer correctly. The fine-tuning and analysis scripts will be

path-dependent process is driven by another multidimensional path-dependent
process. The second class is a generalized one-dimensional stochastic
volatility model with H\""older continuous coefficients. What greatly
differentiates those two classes of models is that both the process and its
correlated driving process have their own subdifferential operators, whose one
special case is the general reflection operators for multi-sided barriers.
Hence, the models investigated fully cover various newly explored variants of
stochastic volatility models whose well-posedness is unknown, and naturally
serve as the rigorous mathematical foundation for new stochastic volatility
model development in terms of multi-dimension, path-dependence, and multi-sided
barrier reflection.

colour strongly depend on their nuclear composition. If the ejecta are very
neutron-rich (electron fraction $Y_\mathrm{e} < 0.25$), they contain fair
amounts of lanthanides and actinides which have large opacities and therefore
efficiently trap the radiation inside the ejecta so that the emission peaks in
the red part of the spectrum. Even small amounts of this high-opacity material
can obscure emission from lower lying material and therefore act as a
""lanthanide curtain"". Here, we investigate how a relativistic jet that punches
through the ejecta can potentially push away a significant fraction of the high
opacity material before the macronova begins to shine. We use the results of
detailed neutrino-driven wind studies as initial conditions and explore with 3D
special relativistic hydrodynamic simulations how jets are propagating through
these winds. Subsequently, we perform Monte Carlo radiative transfer
calculations to explore the resulting macronova emission. We find that the hole
punched by the jet makes the macronova brighter and bluer for on-axis observers
during the first few days of emission, and that more powerful jets have larger
impacts on the macronova.

buyer-optimal information structure, which maximizes the buyers' surplus, and
the sellerworst information structure, which minimizes the seller's revenue. We
translate both information design problems into finite-dimensional, constrained
optimization problems in which one can explicitly solve for the optimal
information structures. In contrast to the case with one buyer (Roesler and
Szentes, 2017), we show that with two or more buyers, the symmetric
buyer-optimal information structure is different from the symmetric
seller-worst information structure. The good is always sold under the
seller-worst information structure but not under the buyer-optimal information
structure. Nevertheless, as the number of buyers goes to infinity, both
symmetric information structures converge to no disclosure. We also show that
in an ex ante symmetric setting, an asymmetric information structure is never
seller-worst but can generate a strictly higher surplus for the buyers than the
symmetric buyer-optimal information structure.

approximation of the true dynamics can be trusted, we estimate the Lipschitz
constant of the difference between the true and learned dynamics, and ensure
the estimate is valid with a given probability. Provided the system has at
least as many controls as states, we also derive existence conditions for a
one-step feedback law which can keep the real system within a small bound of a
nominal trajectory planned with the learned dynamics. Our method imposes the
feedback law existence as a constraint in a sampling-based planner, which
returns a feedback policy around a nominal plan ensuring that, if the Lipschitz
constant estimate is valid, the true system is safe during plan execution,
reaches the goal, and is ultimately invariant in a small set about the goal. We
demonstrate our approach by planning using learned models of a 6D quadrotor and
a 7DOF Kuka arm. We show that a baseline which plans using the same learned
dynamics without considering the error bound or the existence of the feedback
law can fail to stabilize around the plan and become unsafe.

gravitational collapse and formation of a black hole. As gravity is extreme,
rotation is extreme: neutron stars are the fastest rotating stars known, with
periods as short as a millisecond. The presence of a magnetic field not aligned

  Subgraph-Centric Programming Model on Large-scale Power-law Graphs",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The subgraph-centric programming model is a promising approach and has been
applied in many state-of-the-art distributed graph computing frameworks.
However, traditional graph partition algorithms have significant difficulties
in processing large-scale power-law graphs. The major problem is the
communication bottleneck found in many subgraph-centric frameworks. Detailed
analysis indicates that the communication bottleneck is caused by the huge
communication volume or the extreme message imbalance among partitioned
subgraphs. The traditional partition algorithms do not consider both factors at
the same time, especially on power-law graphs.
  In this paper, we propose a novel efficient and balanced vertex-cut graph
partition algorithm (EBV) which grants appropriate weights to the overall
communication cost and communication balance. We observe that the number of
replicated vertices and the balance of edge and vertex assignment have a great
influence on communication patterns of distributed subgraph-centric frameworks,
which further affect the overall performance. Based on this insight, We design
an evaluation function that quantifies the proportion of replicated vertices
and the balance of edges and vertices assignments as important parameters.
Besides, we sort the order of edge processing by the sum of end-vertices'
degrees from small to large. Experiments show that EBV reduces replication
factor and communication by at least 21.8% and 23.7% respectively than other
self-based partition algorithms. When deployed in the subgraph-centric
framework, it reduces the running time on power-law graphs by an average of
16.8% compared with the state-of-the-art partition algorithm. Our results
indicate that EBV has a great potential in improving the performance of
subgraph-centric frameworks for the parallel large-scale power-law graph
processing.

a sample of eight dwarf galaxies with known AGN and suspected outflows.
Outflows are detected in seven of them. The outflows are fast, with
50-percentile (median) velocity of up to $\sim$240 km s$^{-1}$ and
80-percentile line width reaching $\sim$1200 km s$^{-1}$, in clear contrast
with the more quiescent kinematics of the host gas and stellar components. The
outflows are generally spatially extended on a scale of several hundred pc to a
few kpc, although our data do not clearly resolve the outflows in three
targets. The outflows appear to be primarily photoionized by the AGN rather
than shocks or young, massive stars. The kinematics and energetics of these
outflows suggest that they are primarily driven by the AGN, although the star
formation activity in these objects may also contribute to the energy input. A
small but non-negligible portion of the outflowing material likely escapes the
main body of the host galaxy and contributes to the enrichment of the
circumgalactic medium. Overall, the impact of these outflows on their host
galaxies is similar to those taking place in the more luminous AGN in the
low-redshift universe.

interspecific morphological differentiation are best met by automated methods
of machine learning that learn efficient and effective species identification
from training samples. However, limited infraspecific sampling remains a key

two-level data augmentation approach may help to overcome the problem of scarce

visual data augmentation applies classic approaches of data augmentation and
generation of faked images using a GAN approach. Descriptive feature vectors
are derived from bottleneck features of a VGG-16 convolutional neural network

employs synthetic additional sampling in feature space by an oversampling

observations, we thoroughly investigate future theory-agnostic bounds on
modifications of general relativity, as well as bounds on specific theories.
For theory-agnostic bounds, we find that ground-based observations of
stellar-mass black holes and LISA observations of massive black holes can each
lead to improvements of 2-4 orders of magnitude with respect to present
gravitational wave constraints, while multiband observations can yield
improvements of 1-6 orders of magnitude. We also clarify how the relation

high-speed computing and low-latency characteristics. However, there are many
challenges in the implementation of EC. Firstly, user's privacy has been raised
as a major concern because the edge devices may be untrustworthy. In the case
of Private Edge Computing (PEC), a user wants to compute a matrix
multiplication between its local matrix and one of the matrices in a library,
which has been redundantly stored in edge devices. When utilizing resources of
edge devices, the privacy requires that each edge device cannot know which
matrix stored on it is desired by the user for the multiplication. Secondly,
edge devices usually have limited communication and storage resources, which
makes it impossible for them to store all matrices in the library. In this
paper, we consider the limited resources of edge devices and propose an unified
framework for PEC. Within the framework, we study two highly-coupled problems,
(1) storage allocation, that determines which matrices are stored on each edge
device, and (2) computation design, that determines which matrices (or linear
combinations of them) in each edge device are selected to participate in the
computing process with the privacy consideration. Specifically, we give a
general storage allocation scheme and then design two feasible private
computation schemes, i.e., General Private Computation (GPC) scheme and Private
Coded Computation (PCC) scheme. In particular, GPC can be applied in general
case and PCC can only be applied in special cases, while PCC achieves less
communication load. We theoretically analyze the proposed computing schemes and
compare them with other schemes. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to
show the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

also resolve the longstanding lithium problem if $M= 4$ MeV and $m = 0.04$ keV,
where $M$ and $m$ are respectively the masses of $X$ and $\chi$. We confront
this proposal with experiment and demonstrate that cold dark matter decaying
before recombination cannot resolve the $H_0$ problem. Moreover, we show that
the best case scenario for alleviating the $H_0$ tension within the context of
cold dark matter decaying before recombination arises when the particles decay
exclusively into dark radiation, while leaving completely unmodified the
production of light elements. To this end we calculate the general functional
form describing the number of equivalent light neutrino species $\Delta

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2002.10698",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video QA challenges modelers in multiple fronts. Modeling video necessitates
building not only spatio-temporal models for the dynamic visual channel but
also multimodal structures for associated information channels such as
subtitles or audio. Video QA adds at least two more layers of complexity -
selecting relevant content for each channel in the context of the linguistic
query, and composing spatio-temporal concepts and relations in response to the
query. To address these requirements, we start with two insights: (a) content
selection and relation construction can be jointly encapsulated into a
conditional computational structure, and (b) video-length structures can be
composed hierarchically. For (a) this paper introduces a general-reusable
neural unit dubbed Conditional Relation Network (CRN) taking as input a set of
tensorial objects and translating into a new set of objects that encode
relations of the inputs. The generic design of CRN helps ease the common
complex model building process of Video QA by simple block stacking with
flexibility in accommodating input modalities and conditioning features across
both different domains. As a result, we realize insight (b) by introducing
Hierarchical Conditional Relation Networks (HCRN) for Video QA. The HCRN
primarily aims at exploiting intrinsic properties of the visual content of a
video and its accompanying channels in terms of compositionality, hierarchy,
and near and far-term relation. HCRN is then applied for Video QA in two forms,
short-form where answers are reasoned solely from the visual content, and
long-form where associated information, such as subtitles, presented. Our
rigorous evaluations show consistent improvements over SOTAs on well-studied
benchmarks including large-scale real-world datasets such as TGIF-QA and TVQA,
demonstrating the strong capabilities of our CRN unit and the HCRN for complex
domains such as Video QA.

industrial and academic communities due to its potential for increasing the
safety, mobility and efficiency of existing transportation systems. The
state-of-the-art ADS follows the human-in-the-loop (HITL) design, where the
driver's anomalous behaviour is closely monitored by the system. Though many
approaches have been proposed for detecting driver fatigue, they largely depend
on vehicle driving parameters and facial features, which lacks reliability.
Approaches using physiological based sensors (e.g., electroencephalogram or
electrocardiogram) are either too clumsy to wear or impractical to install. In
this paper, we propose a novel driver fatigue detection method by embedding
surface electromyography (sEMG) sensors on a steering wheel. Compared with the
existing methods, our approach is able to collect bio-signals in a
non-intrusive way and detect driver fatigue at an earlier stage. The
experimental results show that our approach outperforms existing methods with
the weighted average F1 scores about 90%. We also propose promising future
directions to deploy this approach in real-life settings, such as applying
multimodal learning using several supplementary sensors.

challenge and a necessity in a world, where the number of IoT devices and the
tampering attacks against them continuously increase. Commonly used onboarding
techniques today include the use of QR codes, pin codes, or serial numbers.
These techniques typically do not protect against unauthorized device access-a
QR code is physically printed on the device, while a pin code may be included
in the device packaging. As a result, any entity that has physical access to a
device can onboard it onto their network and, potentially, tamper it
(e.g.,install malware on the device). To address this problem, in this paper,
we present a framework, called Deep Learning-based Watermarking for authorized
IoT onboarding (DLWIoT), featuring a robust and fully automated image
watermarking scheme based on deep neural networks. DLWIoT embeds user
credentials into carrier images (e.g., QR codes printed on IoT devices), thus
enables IoT onboarding only by authorized users. Our experimental results
demonstrate the feasibility of DLWIoT, indicating that authorized users can
onboard IoT devices with DLWIoT within 2.5-3sec.

determine the optimal mode of transport assignment for trips and to schedule
the routes of available cars and users whilst minimizing cost and maximizing
user satisfaction. We investigate the BiO-MMCP from a user-centred point of
view. As user satisfaction is a crucial aspect in shared mobility systems, we
consider user preferences in a second objective. Users may choose and rank
their preferred modes of transport for different times of the day. In this way
we account for, e.g., different traffic conditions throughout the planning
horizon.
  We study different variants of the problem. In the base problem, the sequence
of tasks a user has to fulfill is fixed in advance and travel times as well as
preferences are constant over the planning horizon. In variant 2,
time-dependent travel times and preferences are introduced. In variant 3, we
examine the challenges when allowing additional routing decisions. Variant 4
integrates variants 2 and 3. For this last variant, we develop a branch-and-cut
algorithm which is embedded in two bi-objective frameworks, namely the
$\epsilon$-constraint method and a weighting binary search method.
Computational experiments show that the branch-and cut algorithm outperforms
the MIP formulation and we discuss changing solutions along the Pareto
frontier.

matching items to their interests in a short time. Consequently, recommendation
systems have become a crucial part of any successful e-commerce services.
Although various recommendation techniques could be used in e-commerce, a
considerable amount of attention has been drawn to session-based recommendation
systems during the recent few years. This growing interest is due to the
security concerns in collecting personalized user behavior data, especially
after the recent general data protection regulations. In this work, we present
a comprehensive evaluation of the state-of-the-art deep learning approaches
used in the session-based recommendation. In session-based recommendation, a
recommendation system counts on the sequence of events made by a user within
the same session to predict and endorse other items that are more likely to
correlate with his/her preferences. Our extensive experiments investigate
baseline techniques (\textit{e.g.,} nearest neighbors and pattern mining
algorithms) and deep learning approaches (\textit{e.g.,} recurrent neural
networks, graph neural networks, and attention-based networks). Our evaluations
show that advanced neural-based models and session-based nearest neighbor
algorithms outperform the baseline techniques in most of the scenarios.
However, we found that these models suffer more in case of long sessions when
there exists drift in user interests, and when there is no enough data to model
different items correctly during training. Our study suggests that using hybrid
models of different approaches combined with baseline algorithms could lead to
substantial results in session-based recommendations based on dataset
characteristics. We also discuss the drawbacks of current session-based
recommendation algorithms and further open research directions in this field.

great potential to reduce manual work through improved methods and hardware.
Neural networks have been successfully applied before - even though they have
been trained only on relatively small datasets with hundreds of documents so
far. To successfully explore deep learning techniques and improve the
information extraction results, a dataset with more than twenty-five thousand
documents has been compiled, anonymized and is published as a part of this
work. We will expand our previous work where we proved that convolutions, graph
convolutions and self-attention can work together and exploit all the
information present in a structured document. Taking the fully trainable method
one step further, we will now design and examine various approaches to using
siamese networks, concepts of similarity, one-shot learning and context/memory
awareness. The aim is to improve micro F1 of per-word classification on the
huge real-world document dataset. The results verify the hypothesis that
trainable access to a similar (yet still different) page together with its
already known target information improves the information extraction.
Furthermore, the experiments confirm that all proposed architecture parts are
all required to beat the previous results. The best model improves the previous
state-of-the-art results by an 8.25 gain in F1 score. Qualitative analysis is
provided to verify that the new model performs better for all target classes.
Additionally, multiple structural observations about the causes of the
underperformance of some architectures are revealed. All the source codes,
parameters and implementation details are published together with the dataset
in the hope to push the research boundaries since all the techniques used in
this work are not problem-specific and can be generalized for other tasks and
