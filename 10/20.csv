allows a continuous assessment of changes in regional bioimpedance of different
organs. One of its most common biomedical applications is monitoring regional
ventilation distribution in critically ill patients treated in intensive care
units. In this work, we put forward a proof-of-principle study that
demonstrates how one can reconstruct synchronously measured respiratory or
circulatory parameters from the EIT image sequence using a deep learning model
trained in an end-to-end fashion. We demonstrate that one can accurately infer
absolute volume, absolute flow, normalized airway pressure and within certain
limitations even the normalized arterial blood pressure from the EIT signal
alone, in a way that generalizes to unseen patients without prior calibration.
As an outlook with direct clinical relevance, we furthermore demonstrate the
feasibility of reconstructing the absolute transpulmonary pressure from a
combination of EIT and absolute airway pressure, as a way to potentially
replace the invasive measurement of esophageal pressure. With these results, we
hope to stimulate further studies building on the framework put forward in this
work.

a gradual shrinking of the 'topological' lobes, and vanishes just beyond the

contain almost imperceptible perturbations to inputs, which mislead a
classifier to incorrect outputs in high confidence. Limited by the extreme
difficulty in examining a high-dimensional image space thoroughly, research on
explaining and justifying the causes of adversarial examples falls behind
studies on attacks and defenses. In this paper, we present a collection of
potential causes of adversarial examples and verify (or partially verify) them
through carefully-designed controlled experiments. The major causes of
adversarial examples include model linearity, one-sum constraint, and geometry
of the categories. To control the effect of those causes, multiple techniques
are applied such as $L_2$ normalization, replacement of loss functions,
construction of reference datasets, and novel models using multi-layer
perceptron probabilistic neural networks (MLP-PNN) and density estimation (DE).
Our experiment results show that geometric factors tend to be more direct
causes and statistical factors magnify the phenomenon, especially for assigning
high prediction confidence. We believe this paper will inspire more studies to
rigorously investigate the root causes of adversarial examples, which in turn
provide useful guidance on designing more robust models.

robotic controllers for low dimensional control tasks. The challenge now for
this new computing paradigm is to scale so that it can keep up with real-world

training, namely the limited ability of their spiking neurons to represent
information and the lack of effective learning algorithms. Here, we propose a
population-coded spiking actor network (PopSAN) trained in conjunction with a
deep critic network using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The population
coding scheme dramatically increased the representation capacity of the network
and the hybrid learning combined the training advantages of deep networks with
the energy-efficient inference of spiking networks. To show the general
applicability of our approach, we integrated it with a spectrum of both
on-policy and off-policy DRL algorithms. We deployed the trained PopSAN on
Intel's Loihi neuromorphic chip and benchmarked our method against the
mainstream DRL algorithms for continuous control. To allow for a fair
comparison among all methods, we validated them on OpenAI gym tasks. Our
Loihi-run PopSAN consumed 140 times less energy per inference when compared
against the deep actor network on Jetson TX2, and had the same level of

distortions that arise due to the chromaticity of the antenna used to make the
observation coupling to the spectral inhomogeneity of these foregrounds. We
demonstrate that these distortions are sufficient to conceal the 21cm signal
when the antenna is not perfectly achromatic and that simple corrections
assuming a constant spatial distribution of foreground power are insufficient
to overcome them. We then propose a new physics-motivated method of modelling
the foregrounds of 21cm experiments in order to fit the chromatic distortions
as part of the foregrounds. This is done by generating a simulated sky model
across the observing band by dividing the sky into $N$ regions and scaling a
base map assuming a distinct uniform spectral index in each region. The
resulting sky map can then be convolved with a model of the antenna beam to
give a model of foregrounds and chromaticity parameterised by the spectral
indices of the $N$ regions. We demonstrate that fitting this model for varying
$N$ using a Bayesian nested sampling algorithm and comparing the results using
the evidence allows the 21cm signal to be reliably detected in data of a
relatively smooth conical log spiral antenna. We also test a much more
chromatic conical sinuous antenna and find this model will not produce a
reliable signal detection, but in a manner that is easily distinguishable from
a true detection.

geometry seminar held at the department of mathematics in National Taiwan

defined on posets equipped with the Alexandrov topology, called the cellular
sheaves. A cellular sheaf is a functor from the category of a poset to the
category of specific algebraic structures (e.g. the category of groups).
Strictly speaking, even equipping the poset with the Alexandrov topology, it is
just the definition of a pre-sheaf on the Alexandrov topological space. By
checking details, cellular sheaves are actually sheaves on topological spaces.
This is a well-known fact in sheaf theory via the Kan extension, while it
requires readers who are familiar with the category theory. In this note, we
follow an elementary approach to describe the connection between cellular
sheaves and sheaves concerned in algebraic geometry, where only basic
commutative algebra and point-set topology are required as the background

serialization libraries) require their clients to use the provided API in a
manner that conforms to a context-free specification. Motivated by this
observation, this paper describes a new technique for verifying the correct
usage of context-free API protocols. The key idea underlying our technique is
to over-approximate the program's feasible API call sequences using a
context-free grammar (CFG) and then check language inclusion between this
grammar and the specification. However, since this inclusion check may fail due
to imprecision in the program's CFG abstraction, we propose a novel refinement
technique to progressively improve the CFG. In particular, our method obtains
counterexamples from CFG inclusion queries and uses them to introduce new
non-terminals and productions to the grammar while still over-approximating the
program's relevant behavior.
  We have implemented the proposed algorithm in a tool called CFPChecker and
evaluate it on 10 popular Java applications that use at least one API with a
context-free specification. Our evaluation shows that CFPChecker is able to
verify correct usage of the API in clients that use it correctly and produces
counterexamples for those that do not. We also compare our method against three
relevant baselines and demonstrate that CFPChecker enables verification of
safety properties that are beyond the reach of existing tools.

provided that two resonant states of $^{7}$H are located in its spectrum at

are indications that the resonant states at 7.5(3) and 11.0(3) MeV are present

distributions, obtained for the studied $^2$H($^8$He,$^3$He)$^7$H reaction, the

data subject to noise and uncertainty, leading to inaccurate results. In order
to improve the accuracy of models with noisy parameters, we consider the
problem of reducing error in an elliptic linear system with the operator
corrupted by noise. We assume the noise preserves positive definiteness, but
otherwise, we make no additional assumptions the structure of the noise. Under
these assumptions, we propose the operator shifting framework, a collection of
easy-to-implement algorithms that augment a noisy inverse operator by
subtracting an additional auxiliary term. In a similar fashion to the
James-Stein estimator, this has the effect of drawing the noisy inverse
operator closer to the ground truth, and hence reduces error by reducing both
bias and variance. We develop bootstrap Monte Carlo algorithms to estimate the
required augmentation magnitude for optimal error reduction in the noisy
system. To improve the tractability of these algorithms, we propose several
approximate polynomial expansions for the operator inverse, and prove desirable
convergence and monotonicity properties for these expansions. We also prove
theorems that quantify the error reduction obtained by operator augmentation.
In addition to theoretical results, we provide a set of numerical experiments
on four different graph and grid Laplacian systems that all demonstrate
effectiveness of our method.

presenting the STIS transit spectrum (0.29--0.93\,$\mu$m) for the first time.
We retrieve the transit spectrum both with a free-chemistry retrieval suite
(AURA) and a complementary chemical equilibrium retrieval suite (PLATON) to
constrain the atmospheric properties at the day-night terminator. Both methods
provide an excellent fit to the observed spectrum. Both AURA and PLATON
retrieve a metal-rich atmosphere for almost all model assumptions (most likely
O/H ratio of $\log_{10}{Z/Z_{\odot}} = 1.46^{+0.53}_{-0.68}$ and
$\log_{10}{Z/Z_{\odot}} = 2.33^{+0.23}_{-0.25}$, respectively); this is driven
by a 4.9-$\sigma$ detection of H$_2$O as well as evidence of gas absorption in
the optical ($>$2.7-$\sigma$ detection) due to Na, AlO and/or VO/TiO, though no
individual species is strongly detected. Both retrievals determine the transit
spectrum to be consistent with a clear atmosphere, with no evidence of haze or
high-altitude clouds. Interior modeling constraints on the maximum atmospheric
metallicity ($\log_{10}{Z/Z_{\odot}} < 1.7$) favor the AURA results. The
inferred elemental oxygen abundance suggests that HAT-P-41b has one of the most
metal-rich atmospheres of any hot Jupiters known to date. Overall, the inferred
high metallicity and high inflation make HAT-P-41b an interesting test case for

nonlinear summation of many inputs. The structural connectivity matrix of
synaptic weights between neurons is a critical determinant of overall network
function, but quantitative links between neural network structure and function
are complex and subtle. For example, many networks can give rise to similar
functional responses, and the same network can function differently depending
on context. Whether certain patterns of synaptic connectivity are required to
generate specific network-level computations is largely unknown. Here we
introduce a geometric framework for identifying synaptic connections required
by steady-state responses in recurrent networks of threshold-linear neurons.
Assuming that the number of specified response patterns does not exceed the
number of input synapses, we analytically calculate the solution space of all
feedforward and recurrent connectivity matrices that can generate the specified
responses from the network inputs. A generalization accounting for noise
further reveals that the solution space geometry can undergo topological
transitions as the allowed error increases, which could provide insight into
both neuroscience and machine learning. We ultimately use this geometric
characterization to derive certainty conditions guaranteeing a non-zero synapse
between neurons. Our theoretical framework could thus be applied to neural
activity data to make rigorous anatomical predictions that follow generally
from the model architecture.

adaptive observer saturates the measurement innovation through a preset static

have limited influence on the estimation. Essential properties of the proposed
architecture include: 1) The detector is fault-free, and the attacked and
attack-free vehicle sensors can be identified in finite time; 2) The observer
guarantees both real-time error bounds and asymptotic error bounds, with
tighter bounds when more attacked or attack-free vehicle sensors are identified
by the detector; 3) The distributed controller ensures closed-loop stability.
The effectiveness of the proposed methods is evaluated through simulations by

superconducting state in the 1T and Td phase at low temperature. Thus, it is a
model system for phase transformation studies as well as quantum phenomena such
as the quantum spin Hall effect and topological superconductivity. Careful
studies of MoTe2 and its potential applications require large area MoTe2 thin
films with high crystallinity and thickness control. Here, we present cm2 scale
synthesis of 2H MoTe2 thin films with layer control and large grains that span
several microns. Layer control is achieved by controlling the initial thickness
of the precursor MoOx thin films, which are deposited on sapphire substrates by
atomic layer deposition and subsequently tellurized. Despite the van der Waals
epitaxy, the precursor-substrate interface is found to critically determine the
uniformity in thickness and grain size of the resulting MoTe2 films: MoTe2
grown on sapphire show uniform films while MoTe2 grown on amorphous SiO2
substrates form islands. This synthesis strategy decouples the layer control
from the variabilities of growth conditions for robust growth results, and is
applicable to grow other transition metal dichalcogenides with layer control.

prediction of the structural properties of 2-RDM is an essential endeavor in
quantum chemistry, condensed matter physics and, more recently, in quantum
computation. Since 1960s, enormous progresses have been made in developing
RDM-based electronic structure theories and their large-scale computational

provided to demonstrate the pronounced violation of these constraints by the

correct small displacements in position and momentum respectively. Each
consists of first mapping the finite GKP code stabilizer information onto an

both square and hexagonal GKP codes, achieving an increase in logical lifetime

that help settle existing disputes: the absence of dependence on wind speed and
air pressure, negative correlation with precipitation; significant positive
correlation with society development level (human development index)
irrespective of testing policies, and percent of the urban population, but an
absence of correlation with population density per se. We find a strong
positive correlation of transmissibility on alcohol consumption, and the
absence of correlation on refugee numbers, contrary to some widespread beliefs.
Significant tendencies with health-related factors are reported, including a
detailed analysis of the blood type group showing consistent tendencies on Rh
factor, and a strong positive correlation of transmissibility with cholesterol
levels.

cross section models into a ``non-orthogonal'' and extensible dimensional
parameter space. Furthermore, it utilizes a rigorous calculus on graphs to
formulate partial derivatives. The GTA cross section models can be generated in
a number of ways. In our current work we explore a step-wise regression and a
complete Taylor series expansion of the parameterized cross sections to develop
expressions to evaluate them. To establish proof-of-principle of the GTA, we
compare numerical results of GTA generated cross section evaluations with
traditional models for canonical PWR case matrices and the AP1000 lattice

tool for building sophisticated prior image models that can be applied to noise
reduction in low-dose CT. We propose a new iterative CT reconstruction
algorithm, called Manifold Reconstruction of Differences (MRoD), which combines
physical and statistical models with a data-driven prior based on manifold
learning. The MRoD algorithm involves estimating a manifold component,
approximating common features among all patients, and the difference component
which has the freedom to fit the measured data. By applying a
sparsity-promoting penalty to the difference image rather than a hard
constraint to the manifold, the MRoD algorithm is able to reconstruct features
which are not present in the training data. The difference component itself may
be independently useful. While the manifold captures typical patient features
(e.g. healthy anatomy), the difference image highlights patient-specific
elements (e.g. pathology). In this work, we present a description of an
optimization framework which combines trained manifold-based modules with
physical modules. We present a simulation study using anthropomorphic lung data
showing that the MRoD algorithm can both isolate differences between a
particular patient and the typical distribution, but also provide significant
noise reduction with less bias than a typical penalized likelihood estimator in
composite manifold plus difference reconstructions.

inductive bias in the training routine, typically a variant of gradient descent
(GD). To better understand this bias, we study the tendency for transformer
parameters to grow in magnitude ($\ell_2$ norm) during training, and its
implications for the emergent representations within self attention layers.
Empirically, we document norm growth in the training of transformer language
models, including T5 during its pretraining. As the parameters grow in
magnitude, we prove that the network approximates a discretized network with
saturated activation functions. Such ""saturated"" networks are known to have a
reduced capacity compared to the full network family that can be described in
terms of formal languages and automata. Our results suggest saturation is a new
characterization of an inductive bias implicit in GD of particular interest for
NLP. We leverage the emergent discrete structure in a saturated transformer to
analyze the role of different attention heads, finding that some focus locally
on a small number of positions, while other heads compute global averages,
allowing counting. We believe understanding the interplay between these two
capabilities may shed further light on the structure of computation within
large transformers.

augmenting the classical FE basis with atom-centered numerical basis functions,
comprising of atomic solutions to the Kohn-Sham problem. Notably, to improve
the conditioning, we orthogonalize the enrichment functions with respect to the
classical FE basis, without sacrificing the locality of the resultant basis. In
addition to improved conditioning, this orthogonalization procedure also
renders the overlap matrix block-diagonal, greatly simplifying its inversion.
Subsequently, we use a Chebyshev polynomial based filtering technique to
efficiently compute the occupied eigenspace in each self-consistent field
iteration. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach
on periodic unit-cells and supercells. The benchmark studies show a staggering
$130\times$ speedup of the orthogonalized enriched FE basis over the classical
FE basis. We also present a comparison of the orthogonalized enriched FE basis
with the LAPW+lo basis, both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. Notably, we
demonstrate that the orthogonalized enriched FE basis can handle large system
sizes of $\sim$10,000 electrons.

obtained by two parties each selecting a value from a set of independent random
variables: a ""prophet"" who knows the value of each variable and may select the
maximum one, and a ""gambler"" who is free to choose the order in which to
observe the values but must select one of them immediately after observing it,
without knowing what values will be sampled for the unobserved variables. It is
known that the gambler can always ensure an expected payoff at least
$0.669\dots$ times as great as that of the prophet. In fact, there exists a
threshold stopping rule which guarantees a gambler-to-prophet ratio of at least
$1-\frac1e=0.632\dots$. In contrast, if the gambler must observe the values in
a predetermined order, the tight bound for the gambler-to-prophet ratio is
$1/2$.
  In this work we investigate a model that interpolates between these two
extremes. We assume there is a predefined set of permutations, and the gambler
is free to choose the order of observation to be any one of these predefined
permutations. Surprisingly, we show that even when only two orderings are
allowed---namely, the forward and reverse orderings---the gambler-to-prophet
ratio improves to $\varphi^{-1}=0.618\dots$, the inverse of the golden ratio.
As the number of allowed permutations grows beyond 2, a striking ""double
plateau"" phenomenon emerges: after increasing from $0.5$ to $\varphi^{-1}$, the
gambler-to-prophet ratio achievable by threshold stopping rules does not exceed
$\varphi^{-1}+o(1)$ until the number of allowed permutations grows to $O(\log
n)$. The ratio reaches $1-\frac1e-\varepsilon$ for a suitably chosen set of
$O(\text{poly}(\varepsilon^{-1})\cdot\log n)$ permutations and does not exceed
$1-\frac1e$ even when the full set of $n!$ permutations is allowed.

several current and future galaxy surveys. Lensing shear, however, is only
sampled at the positions of galaxies with measured shapes in the catalog,
making its associated sky window function one of the most complicated amongst
all projected cosmological probes of inhomogeneities, as well as giving rise to
inhomogeneous noise. Partly for this reason, cosmic shear analyses have been
mostly carried out in real-space, making use of correlation functions, as
opposed to Fourier-space power spectra. Since the use of power spectra can
yield complementary information and has numerical advantages over real-space
pipelines, it is important to develop a complete formalism describing the
standard unbiased power spectrum estimators as well as their associated
uncertainties. Building on previous work, this paper contains a study of the
main complications associated with estimating and interpreting shear power
spectra, and presents fast and accurate methods to estimate two key quantities
needed for their practical usage: the noise bias and the Gaussian covariance
matrix, fully accounting for survey geometry, with some of these results also

these methods by applying them to the latest public data releases of the Hyper

found by considering objective functions that are exponentially close (in the
number of qubits) to the identity matrix. In the finite setting, we found
abrupt transitions in the ability of quantum circuits to be trained to minimize
these objective functions. Specifically, we found that below a critical (target
gate dependent) threshold, circuit training terminates close to the identity
and remains near to the identity for subsequently added blocks trained
piece-wise. A critical layer depth will abruptly train arbitrarily close to the

Algonquin Radio Observatory (ARO) observations at 550-750 MHz of the
scintillation of PSR B1508+55, resulting in a $\sim$10,000-km baseline. This
regime of measurement lies between the shorter few 100-1000~km baselines of
earlier multi-station observations and the much longer earth-space baselines.
We measure a scintillation cross-correlation coefficient of $0.22$, offset from
zero time lag due to a $\sim 45$~s traversal time of the scintillation pattern.
The scintillation time of 135~s is $3\times$ longer, ruling out isotropic as
well as strictly 1D scattering. Hence, the low cross-correlation coefficient is
indicative of highly anisotropic but 2D scattering. The common scintillation
detected on the baseline is confined to low delays of $\lesssim 1 \mu$s,
suggesting that this correlation may not be associated with the parabolic
scintillation arc detected at the GMRT. Detection of pulsed echoes and their
direct imaging with the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) by a different group enable
them to measure a distance of 125~pc to the screen causing these echoes. These
previous measurements, alongside our observations, lead us to propose that
there are at least two scattering screens: the closer 125 pc screen causing the
scintillation arc detected at GMRT, and a screen further beyond causing the
scintillation detected on the GMRT-ARO baseline. We advance the hypothesis that
the 125-pc screen partially resolves the speckle images on the screen beyond
leading to loss of coherence in the scintillation dynamic spectrum, to explain
the low cross-correlation coefficient.

tens of thousands of new supernovae (SNe) discovered each year. However,
several observational domains, including SNe within days or hours of explosion
and faint, red transients, are just beginning to be explored. Here, we present
the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE), a novel optical time-domain survey on the
Pan-STARRS telescopes. Our survey is designed to obtain well-sampled $griz$
light curves for thousands of transient events up to $z \approx 0.2$. This
large sample of transients with 4-band light curves will lay the foundation for
the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope,
providing a critical training set in similar filters and a well-calibrated
low-redshift anchor of cosmologically useful SNe Ia to benefit dark energy
science. As the name suggests, YSE complements and extends other ongoing
time-domain surveys by discovering fast-rising SNe within a few hours to days
of explosion. YSE is the only current four-band time-domain survey and is able
to discover transients as faint $\sim$21.5 mag in $gri$ and $\sim$20.5 mag in
$z$, depths that allow us to probe the earliest epochs of stellar explosions.
YSE is currently observing approximately 750 square degrees of sky every three
days and we plan to increase the area to 1500 square degrees in the near
future. When operating at full capacity, survey simulations show that YSE will
find $\sim$5000 new SNe per year and at least two SNe within three days of
explosion per month. To date, YSE has discovered or observed 8.3% of the
transient candidates reported to the International Astronomical Union in 2020.
We present an overview of YSE, including science goals, survey characteristics
and a summary of our transient discoveries to date.

is increased, a smaller initial energy density of PBHs is required. $ii)$
Thermalization in the dark sector decreases the mean DM kinetic energy,
relaxing the bound from structure formation and hence, allowing light DM with

described by one single parameter (mass), despite the theoretical existence of
secondary parameters such as spin and concentration, which are believed to
impact these relations. In fact, the residuals of these scaling laws appear to
be almost uncorrelated with each other, posing significant constraints on
models where secondary parameters play an important role. Here, we show that a
possible solution is that such secondary parameters are correlated amongst
themselves, in a way that removes correlations in observable space. In
particular, we focus on how the existence of an anti-correlation between the
dark matter halo spin and its concentration -- which is still debated in
simulations -- can weaken the correlation of the residuals of the Tully-Fisher
and mass-size relations. Interestingly, using simple analytic galaxy formation
models, we find that this happens only for a relatively small portion of the
parameter space that we explored, which suggests that this idea could be used
to derive constraints to galaxy formation models that are still unexplored.

ahead of ionization fronts during the Epoch of Reionization, and their effects

battery, injection from supernovae, and an imposed seed field at redshift
$z\gtrsim127$. Using a suite of self-consistent cosmological and zoom-in
simulations based on the Auriga galaxy-formation model, we determine that all
mechanisms produce galactic magnetic fields that equally affect galaxy
formation, and are nearly indistinguishable at $z\lesssim1.5$. The former is
compatible with observed values, while the latter is correlated with the gas
metallicity below a seed-dependent redshift. Low-density gas and haloes below a
seed-dependent mass threshold retain memory of the initial magnetic field. We
produce synthetic Faraday rotation measure maps, showing that they have the
potential to constrain the seeding process, although current observations are
not yet sensitive enough. Our results imply that the ad-hoc assumption of a
primordial seed field - widely used in galaxy formation simulations but of
uncertain physical origin - can be replaced by physically-motivated mechanisms
for magnetogenesis with negligible impact on galactic properties. Additionally,
magnetic fields generated ahead of ionization fronts appear very similar but
weaker than those produced by the Biermann battery. Hence, in a realistic
scenario where both mechanisms are active, the former will be negligible

$\sim10^{11}M_\odot$ quiescent galaxies at $3.2 < z < 3.7$ based on deep H and
K$-$band spectra using the Keck/MOSFIRE near-infrared spectrograph. We find
high velocity dispersions of order $\sigma_e\sim250$ km/s based on strong
Balmer absorption lines and combine these with size measurements based on
HST/WFC3 F160W imaging to infer dynamical masses. The velocity dispersion are
broadly consistent with the high stellar masses and small sizes. Together with
evidence for quiescent stellar populations, the spectra confirm the existence
of a population of massive galaxies that formed rapidly and quenched in the
early universe $z>4$. Investigating the evolution at constant velocity
dispersion between $z\sim3.5$ and $z\sim2$, we find a large increase in
effective radius $0.35\pm0.12$ dex and in dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio
$<$log(M$_{\textrm{dyn}}$/M*)$>$ of 0.33$\pm0.08$ dex, with low expected
contribution from dark matter. The dynamical masses for our $z\sim3.5$ sample
are consistent with the stellar masses for a Chabrier initial mass function
(IMF), with the ratio $<$log(M$_{\textrm{dyn}}$/M$^*_{\textrm{Ch}})>$ =
-0.13$\pm$0.10 dex suggesting an IMF lighter than Salpeter may be common for
massive quiescent galaxies at $z>3$. This is surprising in light of the
Salpeter or heavier IMFs found for high velocity dispersion galaxies at
$z\sim2$ and cores of present-day ellipticals, which these galaxies are thought
to evolve into. Future imaging and spectroscopic observations with resolved
kinematics using the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope could rule out
potential systematics from rotation, and confirm these results.

G0.173-0.42 adds to four other nonthermal radio filaments with X-ray
counterparts, amongst the more than 100 elongated radio structures that have
been identified as synchrotron-emitting radio filaments in the inner couple of
degrees of the Galactic center. The synchrotron mechanism has also been
proposed to explain the emission from X-ray filaments. However, the origin of
radio filaments and the acceleration sites of energetic particles to produce
synchrotron emission in radio and X-rays remain mysterious. Using MeerKAT, VLA,
Chandra, WISE and Spitzer, we present structural details of G0.173-0.42 which
consists of multiple radio filaments, one of which has an X-ray counterpart. A
faint oblique radio filament crosses the radio and X-ray filaments. Based on
the morphology, brightening of radio and X-ray intensities, and radio spectral
index variation, we argue that a physical interaction is taking place between
two magnetized filaments. We consider that the reconnection of the magnetic
field lines at the interaction site leads to the acceleration of particles to
GeV energies. We also argue against the synchrotron mechanism for the X-ray
emission due to the short $\sim$30 year lifetime of TeV relativistic particles.
Instead, we propose that the inverse Compton scattering mechanism is more
likely to explain the X-ray emission by upscattering of seed photons emitted
from a 10^6 solar luminosity star located at the northern tip of the X-ray
filament.

Telescope, we identified the counterpart at the radio source position. Its
location in the color-magnitude diagrams reveals that the companion star is a
faint (V \sim 24.3) He-core white dwarf. We compared the observed companion
magnitudes with those predicted by state-of-the-art binary evolution models and
found out that it has a mass of 0.23 \pm 0.03 Msun, a radius of
0.033^+0.004_-0.005 Rsun and a surface temperature of 11500^+1900_-1300 K.
Combining the companion mass with the pulsar mass function is not enough to
determine the orbital inclination and the neutron star mass; however, the last
two quantities become correlated: we found that either the system is observed
at a low inclination angle, or the neutron star is massive. In fact, assuming
that binaries are randomly aligned with respect to the observer line of sight,
there is a \sim 70% of probability that this system hosts a neutron star more
massive than 1.6 Msun. In fact, the maximum and median mass of the neutron
star, corresponding to orbital inclination angles of 90 deg and 60 deg, are
M_NS,max = 3.1 \pm 0.6 Msun and M_NS,med = 2.4 \pm 0.5 Msun, respectively. On
the other hand, assuming also an empirical neutron star mass probability
distribution, we found that this system could host a neutron star with a mass
of 1.5 \pm 0.1 Msun if orbiting with a low-inclination angle around 40 deg.

quantum algorithms and practically any software framework for quantum

However, the development of quantum simulators was substantially separated from
the rest of the software frameworks which, instead, focus on usability and
compilation. Here, we demonstrate the advantage of co-developing and
integrating simulators and compilers by proposing a specialized compiler pass
to reduce the simulation time for arbitrary circuits. While the concept is
broadly applicable, we present a concrete implementation based on the Intel
Quantum Simulator, a high-performance distributed simulator. As part of this
work, we extend its implementation with additional functionalities related to
the representation of quantum states. The communication overhead is reduced by
changing the order in which state amplitudes are stored in the distributed
memory, a concept analogous to the distinction between local and global qubits
for distributed Schroedinger-type simulators. We then implement a compiler pass
to exploit the novel functionalities by introducing special instructions
governing data movement as part of the quantum circuit. Those instructions
target unique capabilities of simulators and have no analogue in actual quantum
devices. To quantify the advantage, we compare the time required to simulate
random circuits with and without our optimization. The simulation time is
typically halved.

evolution can explain the present configuration if it was initiated when the

energy of the surviving planet either recombination energy stored in the

envelope. We also discuss the evolution of the planet prior to and following
common envelope evolution. Finally, we find that if the system formed through

have been proposed in the literature, such as counterfactual generation and
optimizing over a Gumbel-Softmax distribution. Using a general formulation of

minimization problem. The analysis is used to derive an upper bound on the null
space constant (NSC) associated to this general nonconvex minimization problem,
which is further utilized to derive sufficient conditions for exact recovery as
upper bounds on the restricted isometry constant (RIC), as well as bounds on
optimal sparsity $K$ for which exact recovery occurs. The derived bounds are
explicitly calculated when the sparsity promoting function $f$ under
consideration possesses the property that the associated \emph{elasticity
function}, defined as, $\psi(x)=\frac{xdf(x)/dx}{f(x)}$, is monotonic in
nature. Numerical simulations are carried out to verify the efficacy of the
bounds and interesting conclusions are drawn about the comparative performances
of different sparsity promoting functions for the problem of $1$-sparse signal
recovery.

Over-luminous SN 1991T-like and sub-luminous SN 1991bg-like objects are two
characteristic examples of peculiar SNe. The identification and classification
of such objects is an important step in studying what makes them unique from
the remaining SN population. With the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory
promising on the order of a million new SNe over a ten-year survey,
spectroscopic classifications will be possible for only a small subset of
observed targets. As such, photometric classification has become an
increasingly important concern in preparing for the next generation of
astronomical surveys. Using observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey II
(SDSS-II) SN Survey, we apply here an empirically based classification
technique targeted at the identification of SN 1991bg-like SNe in photometric
data sets. By performing dedicated fits to photometric data in the rest-frame
redder and bluer bandpasses, we classify 16 previously unidentified 91bg-like
SNe. Using SDSS-II host-galaxy measurements, we find that these SNe are
preferentially found in host galaxies having an older average stellar age than
the hosts of normal SNe Ia. We also find that these SNe are found at a further
physical distance from the center of their host galaxies. We find no
statistically significant bias in host galaxy mass or specific star formation
rate for these targets.

self-gravity. Moreover, we performed a simulation including star-formation and
stellar feedback, allowing for a first time a direct comparison with the

planet's surface or in its atmosphere.
  Aims: The aim of this work is to assess the statistical reliability of the
line detection by independent re-analysis of the ALMA data.
  Methods: The ALMA data were reduced as in the published study, following the
provided scripts. First the spectral analysis presented in the study was
reproduced and assessed. Subsequently, the spectrum was statistically
evaluated, including its dependence on selected ALMA baselines.
  Results: We find that the 12th-order polynomial fit to the spectral passband
utilised in the published study leads to spurious results. Following their
recipe, five other >10 sigma lines can be produced in absorption or emission
within 60 km/s from the PH3 1-0 transition frequency by suppressing the
surrounding noise. Our independent analysis shows a feature near the PH3
frequency at a ~2 sigma level, below the common threshold for statistical
significance. Since the spectral data have a non-Gaussian distribution, we
consider a feature at such level as statistically unreliable that cannot be
linked to a false positive probability.
  Conclusions: We find that the published 267-GHz ALMA data provide no
statistical evidence for phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus.

supporting the possibility that the ejecta were interacting with some CSM. A
very shallow slope during the post-plateau phase is also observed and it is

illustrate that this eccentric population has a different distribution of the

for such collaborations is to have a secure system which enables information
sharing and information flow protection. Policy-based management system is a
key mechanism for secure selective sharing of protected resources. However,
policies in each party of such a collaborative environment cannot be static as
they have to adapt to different contexts and situations. One advantage of
collaborative applications is that each party in the collaboration can take
advantage of knowledge of the other parties for learning or enhancing its own
policies. We refer to this learning mechanism as policy transfer. The design of
a policy transfer framework has challenges, including policy conflicts and
privacy issues. Policy conflicts typically arise because of differences in the
obligations of the parties, whereas privacy issues result because of data
sharing constraints for sensitive data. Hence, the policy transfer framework
should be able to tackle such challenges by considering minimal sharing of data
and support policy adaptation to address conflict. In the paper we propose a
framework that aims at addressing such challenges. We introduce a formal

reward signal to units that implement a REINFORCE learning rule. Though this
presents a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation in training a
network, the high variance associated with it renders it impractical to train
deep networks. The high variance arises from the inefficient structural credit
assignment since a single reward signal is used to evaluate the collective
action of all units. To facilitate structural credit assignment, we propose
replacing the reward signal to hidden units with the change in the $L^2$ norm
of the unit's outgoing weight. As such, each hidden unit in the network is
trying to maximize the norm of its outgoing weight instead of the global
reward, and thus we call this learning method Weight Maximization. We prove
that Weight Maximization is approximately following the gradient of rewards in
expectation. In contrast to backpropagation, Weight Maximization can be used to
train both continuous-valued and discrete-valued units. Moreover, Weight
Maximization solves several major issues of backpropagation relating to
biological plausibility. Our experiments show that a network trained with
Weight Maximization can learn significantly faster than REINFORCE and slightly
slower than backpropagation. Weight Maximization illustrates an example of
cooperative behavior automatically arising from a population of self-interested

tailorable frequency. Interestingly, for exactly nine emitters in a nonagon, as
it appears in a common biological light-harvesting complex (LHC2), we find a
distinct minimum for its most dark state decay rate and a maximum of the
effective absorption cross-section, surpassing that for a single absorptive

traced to the fact that the sum of coupling strengths of a single ring emitter
to all others including the center ring closely matches the coupling of the
center to all ring emitters. The emerging dark collective eigenstate has
dominant center occupation facilitating efficient energy absorption and fast
transport. The resonance frequency can be tuned via ring size and dipole
polarization. In analogy to parabolic antennas, the ring concentrates the
incoming radiation at the center without being significantly excited, which
minimizes transport loss and time.

theoretical and experimental studies of the regime with dispersive interaction,
the dissipative regime is still mostly unexplored. Using a renormalization
group technique to solve the three-body Schr\""odinger equation, we show how the
shape and strength of dissipative three-body forces can be universally enhanced
for Rydberg polaritons. We demonstrate how these interactions relate to the
transmission through a single-mode cavity, which can be used as a probe of the
three-body physics in current experiments.

parton interactions with QGP, while low $p_\perp$ data and corresponding models
are employed to infer QGP bulk properties. On the other hand, with a proper
description of high $p_\perp$ parton-medium interactions, high $p_\perp$ probes
become also powerful tomography tools, since they are sensitive to global QGP
features, such as different temperature profiles or initial conditions. This
tomographic role of high $p_\perp$ probes can be utilized to assess the spatial
anisotropy of the QCD matter. With our dynamical energy loss formalism, we show
that a (modified) ratio of $R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ presents a reliable and robust
observable for straightforward extraction of initial state anisotropy. We
analytically estimated the proportionality between the $v_2/(1-R_{AA})$ and
anisotropy coefficient $\epsilon_{2L}$, and found surprisingly good agreement
with full-fledged numerical calculations. Within the current error bars, the
extraction of the anisotropy from the existing data using this approach is
still inaccessible. However, with the expected accuracy improvement in the
upcoming LHC runs, the anisotropy of the QGP formed in heavy ion collisions can
be straightforwardly derived from the data. Such a data-based anisotropy
parameter would present an important test to models describing the initial
stages of heavy-ion collision and formation of QGP, and demonstrate the
usefulness of high $p_\perp$ theory and data in obtaining QGP properties.

computational advantages of near-term quantum computers over their conventional
counterparts. Here, we use ensembles of low-depth random circuits with local
connectivity in $D\ge 1$ spatial dimensions to generate quantum
error-correcting codes. For random stabilizer codes and the erasure channel, we
find strong evidence that a depth $O(\log N)$ random circuit is necessary and
sufficient to converge (with high probability) to zero failure probability for
any finite amount below the optimal erasure threshold, set by the channel
capacity, for any $D$. Previous results on random circuits have only shown that
$O(N^{1/D})$ depth suffices or that $O(\log^3 N)$ depth suffices for all-to-all
connectivity ($D \to \infty$). We then study the critical behavior of the
erasure threshold in the so-called moderate deviation limit, where both the
failure probability and the distance to the optimal threshold converge to zero
with $N$. We find that the requisite depth scales like $O(\log N)$ only for
dimensions $D \ge 2$, and that random circuits require $O(\sqrt{N})$ depth for
$D=1$. Finally, we introduce an ""expurgation"" algorithm that uses quantum
measurements to remove logical operators that cause the code to fail by turning
them into additional stabilizers or gauge operators. With such targeted
measurements, we can achieve sub-logarithmic depth in $D\ge 2$ below capacity
without increasing the maximum weight of the check operators. We find that for
any rate beneath the capacity, high-performing codes with thousands of logical
qubits are achievable with depth 4-8 expurgated random circuits in $D=2$
dimensions. These results indicate that finite-rate quantum codes are
practically relevant for near-term devices and may significantly reduce the
resource requirements to achieve fault tolerance for near-term applications.

transport in an electric field that is spatially modulated within a finite
region that obeys periodic boundaries. The spatial distribution of the mean
velocity, the mean energy, and the density of the electrons, the importance of
the excitation channels, as well as the electron energy distribution function

field reversal occurs, we observe trapping of a significant population of the

  Tensor structure is often present in the data matrices of least squares,

the boundary of a domain and the property that the Green function for elliptic

hyperplanes). The results are novel in a variety of ways, in particular (1)
this is the first time the underlying property of the control of the Green
function by affine functions, or by the distance to the boundary, in the sense
of the Carleson prevalent sets, appears in the literature; the ""direct"" result
established here is new even in the half space; (2) the results are optimal,
providing a full characterization of uniform rectifiability under the
(standard) mild topological assumptions; (3) to the best of the authors'
knowledge, this is the first free boundary result applying to all elliptic
operators, without any restriction on the coefficients (the direct one assumes
the standard, and necessary, Carleson measure condition); (4) our theorems
apply to all domains, with possibly lower dimensional boundaries: this is the
first free boundary result in higher co-dimensional setting and as such, the
first PDE characterization of uniform rectifiability for a set of dimension
$d$, $d<n-1$, in ${\mathbb{R}}^n$. The paper offers a general way to deal with
related issues considerably beyond the scope of the aforementioned theorem,
including the question of approximability of the gradient of the Green
function, and the comparison of the Green function to a certain version of the
distance to the original set rather than distance to the hyperplanes.

conformal field theories and free-fermion chains, we show that the
quasiparticle picture can be adapted to this goal, leading to a general
conjecture for the charged entropies whose Fourier transform gives the desired
symmetry resolved entanglement $S_n(q)$. We point out two physically relevant
effects that should be easily observed in atomic experiments: a delay time for
the onset of $S_n(q)$ which grows linearly with $|\Delta q|$ (the difference
from the charge $q$ and its mean value), and an effective equipartition when
$|\Delta q|$ is much smaller than the subsystem size.

relevance: given a query, return some number of results ordered by relevance to
the user. The problem of result list truncation, or where to truncate the
ranked list of results, however, has received less attention despite being
crucial in a variety of applications. Such truncation is a balancing act
between the overall relevance, or usefulness of the results, with the user cost
of processing more results. Result list truncation can be challenging because
relevance scores are often not well-calibrated. This is particularly true in
large-scale IR systems where documents and queries are embedded in the same
metric space and a query's nearest document neighbors are returned during
inference. Here, relevance is inversely proportional to the distance between
the query and candidate document, but what distance constitutes relevance
varies from query to query and changes dynamically as more documents are added
to the index. In this work, we propose Surprise scoring, a statistical method
that leverages the Generalized Pareto distribution that arises in extreme value
theory to produce interpretable and calibrated relevance scores at query time
using nothing more than the ranked scores. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
the result list truncation task across image, text, and IR datasets and compare
it to both classical and recent baselines. We draw connections to hypothesis
testing and $p$-values.

scale at which are often assessed parameters and fields reflecting material

varying fields. Such analysis is difficult in geometrically disordered media,
because space discretization based on standard coordinate systems is not
commensurate with the natural discretization into geometrically disordered
cells. Indeed, we found that two classical spectral methods, the Fast Fourier
Transform and the Graph Fourier transform, fail to reproduce all expected
properties of spectra of plane waves and of white noise. We therefore built a
method, which we call Cellular Fourier Transform (CFT), to analyze cell-scale
fields, which comprise both discrete fields defined only at cell level and
continuous fields smoothed out from their sub-cell variations. Our approach is
based on the construction of a discrete operator suited to the disordered
geometry and on the computation of its eigenvectors, which, respectively, play
the same role as the Laplace operator and sine waves in Euclidean coordinate
systems. We show that CFT has the expected behavior for sinusoidal fields and
for random fields with long-range correlations. Our approach for spectral
analysis is suited to any geometrically disordered material, such as a
biological tissue with complex geometry, opening the path to systematic

equation, with finite nonsingular data, grows rapidly for some period of time.
Approximations to homogeneous solutions of the linear response equation are
computed and it is found that the criterion is violated when the maximum value,
$E_{\rm max}$, obtained by the electric field is of the order of the critical
scale for the Schwinger effect, $E_{\rm max} \sim E_{\rm crit}\equiv m^2/q$,
where $m$ is the mass of the quantized field and $q$ is its electric charge.
For these approximate solutions the criterion appears to be satisfied in the
extreme limits $\frac{qE_{\rm max}}{m^2} \ll 1$ and $\frac{qE_{\rm max}}{m^2}
\gg 1$.

including Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) and Auxiliary Field Quantum
Monte Carlo (AFQMC), have historically assumed pivotal roles in the
investigation of the finite temperature phase diagrams of a wide variety of
multidimensional lattice models and materials. Despite their utility, however,
these techniques are typically formulated in the grand canonical ensemble,
which makes them difficult to apply to condensates like superfluids and
difficult to benchmark against alternative methods that are formulated in the
canonical ensemble. Working in the grand canonical ensemble is furthermore
accompanied by the increased overhead associated with having to determine the
chemical potentials that produce desired fillings. Given this backdrop, in this
work, we present a new recursive approach for performing AFQMC simulations in
the canonical ensemble that does not require knowledge of chemical potentials.
To derive this approach, we exploit the convenient fact that AFQMC solves the
many-body problem by decoupling many-body propagators into integrals over
one-body problems to which non-interacting theories can be applied. We
benchmark the accuracy of our technique on illustrative Bose and Fermi Hubbard
models and demonstrate that it can converge more quickly to the ground state
than grand canonical AFQMC simulations. We believe that our novel use of
HS-transformed operators to implement algorithms originally derived for
non-interacting systems will motivate the development of a variety of other
methods and anticipate that our technique will enable direct performance
comparisons against other many-body approaches formulated in the canonical
ensemble.

of topology $3_1$, $4_1$, or $5_1$, as well as unknotted polymers that are
capable of forming S-loops. We measure the variation of the free energy $F$

varying the polymer topology, persistence length $P$ and cylinder diameter $D$
on the free energy functions. Similarly, we characterize the behavior of the
knot span along the channel. We find that increasing the knot complexity
increases the typical size of the knot. In the regime of low $X$, where the
knot/S-loop size is large, the conformational behavior is independent of
polymer topology. In addition, the scaling properties of the free energy and
knot span are in agreement with predictions from a theoretical model
constructed using known properties of interacting polymers in the Odijk regime.
We also examine the variation of $F$ with position of a knot in conical
channels for various values of the cone angle $\alpha$. The free energy
decreases as the knot moves in a direction where the cone widens, and it also
decreases with increasing $\alpha$ and with increasing knot complexity. The
behavior is in agreement with predictions from a theoretical model in which the
dominant contribution to the change in $F$ is the change in the size of the
hairpins as the knot moves to the wider region of the channel.

study of strain relaxation in epitaxial, tetragonal phase of Nd-doped SSO films
grown on GdScO3 (110) (GSO) substrates using radical-based hybrid molecular

prescribed-dose model, an ovarian-dose model for predicting acute ovarian
failure has a slightly lower area under the receiver operating characteristic

48%. This phenomenon of conflicting conclusions is not uncommon, and it creates
a dilemma in medical decision making. In this article, we examine the
analytical connections and differences between two IncV metrics: IncV in AUC
(IncV-AUC) and IncV in AP (IncV-AP). Additionally, since they are both
semi-proper scoring rules, we compare them with a strictly proper scoring rule:
the IncV of the scaled Brier score (IncV-sBrS), via a numerical study. We
demonstrate that both IncV-AUC and IncV-AP are weighted averages of the changes
(from the existing model to the new one) in separating the risk score
distributions between events and non-events. However, IncV-AP assigns heavier
weights to the changes in the high-risk group, whereas IncV-AUC weights the

from negative to positive, but the size of IncV-AUC is much smaller. In
addition, IncV-AP and IncV-sBr Sare highly consistent, but IncV-AUC is
negatively correlated with IncV-sBrS and IncV-AP at a low event rate. IncV-AUC

performance of an accelerator facility often necessitates multi-objective
optimization, where operators must balance trade-offs between multiple
objectives simultaneously, often using limited, temporally expensive beam
observations. Usually, accelerator optimization problems are solved offline,
prior to actual operation, with advanced beamline simulations and parallelized
optimization methods (NSGA-II, Swarm Optimization). Unfortunately, it is not
feasible to use these methods for online multi-objective optimization, since
beam measurements can only be done in a serial fashion, and these optimization
methods require a large number of measurements to converge to a useful

efficiently in a serialized manner and is thus a critical step towards
practical online multi-objective optimization in accelerators.This method uses
a set of Gaussian process surrogate models, along with a multi-objective

and continuous control tasks. In particular, recent work, for discrete action
spaces, demonstrated the effectiveness of latent-space planning via Monte-Carlo
Tree Search (MCTS) for bootstrapping MBRL during learning and at test time.
However, the potential gains from latent-space tree search have not yet been
demonstrated for environments with continuous action spaces. In this work, we
propose and explore an MBRL approach for continuous action spaces based on
tree-based planning over learned latent dynamics. We show that it is possible
to demonstrate the types of bootstrapping benefits as previously shown for
discrete spaces. In particular, the approach achieves improved sample
efficiency and performance on a majority of challenging continuous-control
benchmarks compared to the state-of-the-art.

all work in dimension $d\ge 1$, although, in $d=1$ the most natural way is to
use intersections of trajectories, which requires nothing but strong Markov
property and non-degeneracy of the diffusion coefficient. In dimensions $d>1$
it is possible to use embedded Markov chains either by considering discrete
times $n=0,1,\ldots$, or by arranging special stopping time sequences and to
use local Markov -- Dobrushin's (MD) condition. Further applications may be
based on one or another version of the MD condition. For studies of convergence
and mixing rates the (Markov) process must be strong Markov and recurrent;
however, recurrence is a separate issue which is not discussed in this paper.

language processing tasks. One challenge of performing pooling operations on
graph data is the lack of locality that is not well-defined on graphs. Previous
studies used global ranking methods to sample some of the important nodes, but
most of them are not able to incorporate graph topology. In this work, we
propose the topology-aware pooling (TAP) layer that explicitly considers graph
topology. Our TAP layer is a two-stage voting process that selects more
important nodes in a graph. It first performs local voting to generate scores
for each node by attending each node to its neighboring nodes. The scores are
generated locally such that topology information is explicitly considered. In
addition, graph topology is incorporated in global voting to compute the
importance score of each node globally in the entire graph. Altogether, the
final ranking score for each node is computed by combining its local and global
voting scores. To encourage better graph connectivity in the sampled graph, we
propose to add a graph connectivity term to the computation of ranking scores.
Results on graph classification tasks demonstrate that our methods achieve
consistently better performance than previous methods.

cosmological constraints on model parameters for both Type-I and Type-II 2HDMs
from the requirement that domain walls do not dominate the Universe by the
present day. For Type-I 2HDMs, we deduce the lower bound on the key parameter
$\tan\beta > 10^5$ for a wide range of Higgs-boson masses $\sim$ 100 GeV or
greater close to the Standard Model alignment limit. In addition, we perform
numerical simulations of the 2HDM with an approximate as well as an exact $Z_2$
symmetry but biased initial conditions. In both cases, we find that domain wall
networks are unstable and, hence, do not survive at late times. The domain
walls experience an exponential suppression of scaling in these models which
can help ameliorate the stringent constraints found in the case of an exact
discrete symmetry. For a 2HDM with softly-broken $Z_2$ symmetry, we relate the
size of this exponential suppression to the soft-breaking bilinear parameter
$m_{12}$ allowing limits to be placed on this parameter of order $\mu$eV, such
that domain wall domination can be avoided. In particular, for Type-II 2HDMs,
we obtain a corresponding lower limit on the CP-odd phase $\theta$ generated by
QCD instantons, $\theta \ \stackrel{>}{{}_\sim}\ 10^{-11}/(\sin\beta
\cos\beta)$, which is in some tension with the upper limit of $\theta \

non-observation of a non-zero neutron electric dipole moment. For a

paper examines 1) how often people read about security incidents online, 2) of

by trying to read more about the incident, and 3) what influences the
likelihood that they will read about an incident and take some action. We study
this by quantitatively examining real-world internet-browsing data from 303
participants.
  Our findings present a bleak view of awareness of security incidents. Only
16% of participants visited any web pages related to six widely publicized
large-scale security incidents; few read about one even when an incident was
likely to have affected them (e.g., the Equifax breach almost universally
affected people with Equifax credit reports). We further found that more severe
incidents as well as articles that constructively spoke about the incident
inspired more action. We conclude with recommendations for specific future
research and for enabling useful security incident information to reach more
people.

changed their passwords after a breach announcement.
  Of the 249 participants, 63 had accounts on breached domains; only 33% of the
63 changed their passwords and only 13% (of 63) did so within three months of
the announcement. New passwords were on average 1.3x stronger than old
passwords (when comparing log10-transformed strength), though most were weaker
or of equal strength. Concerningly, new passwords were overall more similar to
participants' other passwords, and participants rarely changed passwords on
other sites even when these were the same or similar to their password on the
breached domain. Our results highlight the need for more rigorous
password-changing requirements following a breach and more effective breach
notifications that deliver comprehensive advice.

irregular workloads for supercomputers and data centers. The core idea behind
the lock is a modular design that is an interplay of three distributed data
structures: a counter of readers/writers in the critical section, a set of
queues for ordering writers waiting for the lock, and a tree that binds all the
queues and synchronizes writers with readers. Each structure is associated with
a parameter for favoring either readers or writers, enabling adjustable
performance that can be viewed as a point in a three dimensional parameter
space. We also develop a distributed topology-aware MCS lock that is a building
block of the above design and improves state-of-the-art MPI implementations.
Both schemes use non-blocking Remote Memory Access (RMA) techniques for highest
performance and scalability. We evaluate our schemes on a Cray XC30 and
illustrate that they outperform state-of-the-art MPI-3 RMA locking protocols by
81% and 73%, respectively. Finally, we use them to accelerate a distributed
hashtable that represents irregular workloads such as key-value stores or graph
processing.

work under a closed set assumption and suffer from overfitting to previously

and requires extensive training of radiologists. Hence, training anomaly
detection in a fully unsupervised or self-supervised fashion would be
advantageous, allowing a significant reduction of time spent on the report by
radiologists. In this paper, we present SALAD, an end-to-end deep
self-supervised methodology for anomaly detection on X-Ray images. The proposed
method is based on an optimization strategy in which a deep neural network is
encouraged to represent prototypical local patterns of the normal data in the
embedding space. During training, we record the prototypical patterns of normal
training samples via a memory bank. Our anomaly score is then derived by
measuring similarity to a weighted combination of normal prototypical patterns
within a memory bank without using any anomalous patterns. We present extensive
experiments on the challenging NIH Chest X-rays and MURA dataset, which
indicate that our algorithm improves state-of-the-art methods by a wide margin.

efficient autonomous driving in the future by enabling collision avoidance and
platooning applications. For full automation, these applications require
cm-level positioning accuracy and greater than 50 Hz update rate. Since
sensor-based methods (e.g., LIDAR, cameras) have not been able to reliably
satisfy these requirements under all conditions so far, complementary methods
are sought. Recently, alternative methods that use visible light communication
(VLC) signals from vehicle head/tail LED lights for positioning (VLP) have
shown significant promise, attaining cm-level accuracy and near-kHz rate in
realistic driving scenarios. These methods estimate position in two steps: 1)
Relative transmitter bearings (angle) or ranges (distance) are measured based
on received VLC signals, and 2) these measurements are combined to estimate
relative positions of transmitters (i.e., head/tail lights). In this survey
paper, we first review existing bearing/range measurement techniques and
positioning algorithms for vehicular VLP. Next, we formulate two new
positioning algorithms: One based on consecutive range measurements from a
single receiver, and another one based on differential bearing measurements
from two receivers. We analyze the performance of all methods by deriving their
respective Cramer-Rao lower bounds on positioning accuracy (CRLB) and
simulating them in realistic driving scenarios with challenging noise and
weather conditions. Our results show that VLP methods can indeed satisfy the
accuracy and rate requirements for localization in collision avoidance and
platooning applications. Finally, we discuss remaining open challenges that are
faced for the deployment of VLP solutions in the automotive sector.

into pillar-like structures. Direct signatures of star formation through
outflows and jets are observed in these structures, typically at their tips.
Recent numerical simulations have suggested that this star formation could
potentially be triggered by photoionising radiation, driving compressive modes
of turbulence in the pillars. In this study we use recent high-resolution ALMA
observations of $^{12}\mathrm{CO}$, $^{13}\mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{C}^{18}
\mathrm{O}, \; J = 2-1$ emission to test this hypothesis for pillars in the
Carina Nebula. We analyse column density and intensity-weighted velocity maps,
and subtract any large-scale bulk motions in the plane of the sky to isolate
the turbulent motions. We then reconstruct the dominant turbulence driving mode
in the pillars, by computing the turbulence driving parameter $b$,
characterised by the relation $\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0} = b \mathcal{M}$ between
the standard deviation of the density contrast $\sigma_{\rho/\rho_0}$ (with gas
density $\rho$ and its average $\rho_0$) and the turbulent Mach number
$\mathcal{M}$. We find values of \mbox{$b\sim0.7$--$1.0$} for most of the
pillars, suggesting that predominantly compressive modes of turbulence are
driven in the pillars by the ionising radiation from nearby massive stars. We
find that this range of $b$ values can produce star formation rates in the
pillars that are a factor $\sim 3$ greater than with $b \sim 0.5$, a typical
average value of $b$ for spiral-arm molecular clouds. Our results provide
further evidence for the potential triggering of star formation in pillars
through compressive turbulent motions.

broad-emission lines, including H$\beta$ and He II, were observed in the first
and third years, and clear time lags between them are measured. The broad
H$\beta$ line profile consists of two Gaussian components: an
intermediate-width H$\beta_{\rm IC}$ with a full width at half-maximum (FWHM)
of 1964$\pm$18 $\rm km~s^{-1}$ and another very broad H$\beta_{\rm VBC}$ with a
FWHM of 7570$\pm$83 $\rm km~s^{-1}$. H$\beta_{\rm IC}$ has long time lags of
$\sim$40--60 days in the rest frame, while H$\beta_{\rm VBC}$ shows nearly zero
time delay with respect to the optical continuum at 5100 \AA. The
velocity-resolved delays show consistent results: lags of $\sim$30--50 days at
the core of the broad H$\beta$ line and roughly zero lags at the wings.
H$\beta_{\rm IC}$ has a redshift of $\sim$400 $\rm km~s^{-1}$ which seems to be
stable for nearly 30 years by comparing with archived spectra, and may
originate from an infall. The root mean square (rms) spectrum of H$\beta_{\rm
VBC}$ shows a double-peaked profile with brighter blue peak and extended red
wing in the first year, which matches the signature of a thin disk. Both the
double-peaked profile and the near-zero lag suggest that H$\beta_{\rm VBC}$
comes from a region associated with the part of the accretion disc that emits
the optical continuum. Adopting the FWHM (in the rms spectrum) and the time lag
measured for the total H$\beta$ line, and a virial factor of 1.5, we obtain a
virial mass of $2.89_{-0.69}^{+0.60} \times10^7 M_{\odot}$ for the central

which is capable, in principle, of dealing with a system of a large number of
anyons in an external potential. Comparison with exact results for few
particles shows that the model captures the behavior qualitatively and
semi-quantitatively, especially in the vicinity of the fermionic statistics. We
then study anyons with statistics parameter $1+1/n$, which are thought to
condense into a superconducting state. An indication of the superconducting
behavior is the mean-field result that, for uniform density systems, the ground
state energy increases under the application of an external magnetic field
independent of its direction. Our density-functional-theory based analysis does
not find that to be the case for finite systems of anyons, which can
accommodate a weak external magnetic field through density transfer between the
bulk and the boundary rather than through transitions across effective Landau
levels, but the ""Meissner repulsion"" of the external magnetic field is
recovered in the thermodynamic limit as the effect of the boundary becomes
negligible. We also consider the quantum Hall effect of anyons, and show that
its topological properties, such as the charge and statistics of the
excitations and the quantized Hall conductance, arise in a self-consistent
fashion.

simple approach to improve a model's calibration and robustness. Similarly,
data augmentation techniques, which encode prior information in the form of
invariant feature transformations, are effective for improving calibration and
robustness. In this paper, we show a surprising pathology: combining ensembles
and data augmentation can harm model calibration. This leads to a trade-off in
practice, whereby improved accuracy by combining the two techniques comes at
the expense of calibration. On the other hand, selecting only one of the
techniques ensures good uncertainty estimates at the expense of accuracy. We
investigate this pathology and identify a compounding under-confidence among
methods which marginalize over sets of weights and data augmentation techniques
which soften labels. Finally, we propose a simple correction, achieving the
best of both worlds with significant accuracy and calibration gains over using
only ensembles or data augmentation individually. Applying the correction
produces new state-of-the art in uncertainty calibration across CIFAR-10,
CIFAR-100, and ImageNet.

to using commenter subscriptions to discover channels. The subscription data,
along with an iterative approach, is applied to discover, to our current

find that our model performs better than the average individual human reviewer

have shown promising results in unconditional and semi-supervised image
generation. We propose a self-supervised approach (LT-GAN) to improve the
generation quality and diversity of images by estimating the GAN-induced
transformation (i.e. transformation induced in the generated images by
perturbing the latent space of generator). Specifically, given two pairs of
images where each pair comprises of a generated image and its transformed
version, the self-supervision task aims to identify whether the latent
transformation applied in the given pair is same to that of the other pair.
Hence, this auxiliary loss encourages the generator to produce images that are
distinguishable by the auxiliary network, which in turn promotes the synthesis
of semantically consistent images with respect to latent transformations. We
show the efficacy of this pretext task by improving the image generation
quality in terms of FID on state-of-the-art models for both conditional and
unconditional settings on CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. Moreover,
we empirically show that LT-GAN helps in improving controlled image editing for
CelebA-HQ and ImageNet over baseline models. We experimentally demonstrate that
our proposed LT self-supervision task can be effectively combined with other
state-of-the-art training techniques for added benefits. Consequently, we show
that our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art FID score of 9.8 on
conditional CIFAR-10 image generation.

diagram, we consider 303 to be candidate prestellar cores, and 178 of these to
be ""robust"" prestellar cores. From an independent extraction of sources at 70
$\mu$m, we consider 25 of the 832 dense cores to be protostellar. The
distribution of background column densities coincident with candidate
prestellar cores peaks at 2-4 $\times$ 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. About half of the
candidate prestellar cores in Cepheus may have formed due to the widespread
fragmentation expected to occur within filaments of ""transcritical"" line mass.
The lognormal robust prestellar core mass function (CMF) drawn from all five
Cepheus clouds peaks at 0.56 M$_{\odot}$ and has a width of $\sim$0.5 dex,
similar to that of Aquila's CMF. Indeed, the width of Cepheus' aggregate CMF is
similar to the stellar system Initial Mass Function (IMF). The similarity of
CMF widths in different clouds and the system IMF suggests a common, possibly
turbulent origin for seeding the fluctuations that evolve into prestellar cores
and stars.

network setting include accounting for the fraction or count of treated

study provides an approach that accounts for both the local structure in a

""causal network motifs"", which are network motifs that characterize the
assignment conditions in local ego networks; and then we propose a tree-based
algorithm for identifying different network interference conditions and
estimating their average potential outcomes. Our approach can account for
social network theories, such as structural diversity and echo chambers, and
also can help specify network interference conditions that are suitable to each
experiment. We test our method on a synthetic network setting and on a

mean field game of controls, briefly MFGC. Such a game describes the
interaction of infinitely many negligible players competing to optimize a
personal value function that depends in aggregate on the state and, most
notably, control choice of all other players. A solution of the system
corresponds to a Nash Equilibrium, a group optimal strategy for which no one
player can improve by altering only their own action. We investigate the second
order, possibly degenerate, case with non-strictly elliptic diffusion operator
and local coupling function. The main result exploits potentiality to employ
variational techniques to provide a unique weak solution to the system, with
additional space and time regularity results under additional assumptions. New
analytical subtleties occur in obtaining a priori estimates with the
introduction of an additional coupling that depends on the state distribution

Anticipating this shift, we propose SlimSell: a vectorizable graph
representation to accelerate Breadth-First Search (BFS) based on sparse-matrix
dense-vector (SpMV) products. SlimSell extends and combines the
state-of-the-art SIMD-friendly Sell-C-sigma matrix storage format with
tropical, real, boolean, and sel-max semiring operations. The resulting design
reduces the necessary storage (by up to 50%) and thus pressure on the memory
subsystem. We augment SlimSell with the SlimWork and SlimChunk schemes that
reduce the amount of work and improve load balance, further accelerating BFS.
We evaluate all the schemes on Intel Haswell multicore CPUs, the
state-of-the-art Intel Xeon Phi KNL manycore CPUs, and NVIDIA Tesla GPUs. Our
experiments indicate which semiring offers highest speedups for BFS and
illustrate that SlimSell accelerates a tuned Graph500 BFS code by up to 33%.
This work shows that vectorization can secure high-performance in BFS based on
SpMV products; the proposed principles and designs can be extended to other
graph algorithms.

  Systematic Mapping Study","Accepted in Journal of Systems and Software",,,,"cs.SE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Background: The development of scientific software applications is far from
trivial, due to the constant increase in the necessary complexity of these
applications, their increasing size, and their need for intensive maintenance
and reuse. Aim: To this end, developers of scientific software (who usually
lack a formal computer science background) need to use appropriate software
engineering (SE) practices. This paper describes the results of a systematic
mapping study on the use of SE for scientific application development and their
impact on software quality. Method: To achieve this goal we have performed a
systematic mapping study on 359 papers. We first describe a catalogue of SE
practices used in scientific software development. Then, we discuss the quality
attributes of interest that drive the application of these practices, as well
as tentative side-effects of applying the practices on qualities. Results: The
main findings indicate that scientific software developers are focusing on
practices that improve implementation productivity, such as code reuse, use of
third-party libraries, and the application of ""good"" programming techniques. In
addition, apart from the finding that performance is a key-driver for many of
these applications, scientific software developers also find maintainability
and productivity to be important. Conclusions: The results of the study are
compared to existing literature, are interpreted under a software engineering
prism, and various implications for researchers and practitioners are provided.
One of the key findings of the study, which is considered as important for
driving future research endeavors is the lack of evidence on the trade-offs
that need to be made when applying a software practice, i.e., negative
(indirect) effects on other quality attributes.

growing Internet of things (IoT) implementations at a compound annual growth

breed of IoT applications driven by artificial intelligence (AI), fog radio
access network (F-RAN) has been recently introduced for the fifth generation
(5G) wireless communications to overcome the latency limitations of cloud-RAN
(C-RAN). We consider the network slicing problem of allocating the limited
resources at the network edge (fog nodes) to vehicular and smart city users
with heterogeneous latency and computing demands in dynamic environments. We
develop a network slicing model based on a cluster of fog nodes (FNs)
coordinated with an edge controller (EC) to efficiently utilize the limited
resources at the network edge. For each service request in a cluster, the EC
decides which FN to execute the task, i.e., locally serve the request at the
edge, or to reject the task and refer it to the cloud. We formulate the problem
as infinite-horizon Markov decision process (MDP) and propose a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) solution to adaptively learn the optimal slicing
policy. The performance of the proposed DRL-based slicing method is evaluated
by comparing it with other slicing approaches in dynamic environments and for
different scenarios of design objectives. Comprehensive simulation results
corroborate that the proposed DRL-based EC quickly learns the optimal policy
through interaction with the environment, which enables adaptive and automated
network slicing for efficient resource allocation in dynamic vehicular and
smart city environments.

four types of impurities; boron substitution on carbon sites (B(C)), carbon
substitution on nitrogen sites (C(N)), nitrogen substitution on carbon sites
(N(C)), and sulfur substitution on nitrogen sites (S(N)). From cohesive energy
calculations, we find that the C(N) and B(C) substitutions are the most
energetically favorable and induce small bond modifications in the vicinity of
the impurity, while the S(N) induces strong lattice distortions. Though all of
the studied impurities induce defect levels inside the band gap of these
materials, their electronic properties are poles apart depending on the
behavior of the impurity as an acceptor or a donor. It is also observed that
acceptor (donor) wavefunctions are composed only of $\sigma$ ($\pi$) orbitals
from the impurity itself and/or neighboring sites. Consequently, acceptor
wavefunctions are directed towards the pores and donor wavefunctions are more
extended throughout the neighboring atoms, a property that could further be
explored to modify the interaction between these materials and adsorbates.
Moreover, impurity properties display a strong site sensitivity and ground
state binding energies ranging from $0.03$ to $1.13$ eV, thus offering an
interesting route for tuning the optical properties of these materials.
Finally, spin-polarized calculations reveal that all impurity configurations
have a magnetic ground state that rises from the spin splitting of the impurity
levels. In a few configurations, more than one impurity level can be found
inside the gap and two of them could potentially be explored as two-level
systems for single-photon emission, following similar proposals recently made
on defect complexes on TMDCs.

Schr\""odinger bridge problem. The objective of this paper is to study the
relationship between optimality and long-term stability of a family of exact

forcing them to become even more different and more diverse. Doing so enhances

Therefore, the key for the SSCD task is to design an effective feature fusion
method that can improve the accuracy of the corresponding change maps. To this
end, we present a novel Hierarchical Paired Channel Fusion Network (HPCFNet),
which utilizes the adaptive fusion of paired feature channels. Specifically,
the features of a given image pair are jointly extracted by a Siamese

the fusion of channel pairs at multiple feature levels. In addition, based on
the observation that the distribution of scene changes is diverse, we further
propose a Multi-Part Feature Learning (MPFL) strategy to detect diverse
changes. Based on the MPFL strategy, our framework achieves a novel approach to
adapt to the scale and location diversities of the scene change regions.

temporarily occluded. What are the neural mechanisms underlying our capacity to
track moving objects when there is no physical stimulus for the brain to track?
One possibility is that the brain 'fills-in' information about imagined objects
using internally generated representations similar to those generated by
feed-forward perceptual mechanisms. Alternatively, the brain might deploy a
higher order mechanism, for example using an object tracking model that
integrates visual signals and motion dynamics. In the present study, we used
EEG and time-resolved multivariate pattern analyses to investigate the spatial
processing of visible and imagined objects. Participants tracked an object that
moved in discrete steps around fixation, occupying six consecutive locations.
They were asked to imagine that the object continued on the same trajectory
after it disappeared and move their attention to the corresponding positions.
Time-resolved decoding of EEG data revealed that the location of the visible
stimuli could be decoded shortly after image onset, consistent with early
retinotopic visual processes. For processing of unseen/imagined positions, the
patterns of neural activity resembled stimulus-driven mid-level visual
processes, but were detected earlier than perceptual mechanisms, implicating an
anticipatory and more variable tracking mechanism. Encoding models revealed
that spatial representations were much weaker for imagined than visible
stimuli. Monitoring the position of imagined objects thus utilises similar
perceptual and attentional processes as monitoring objects that are actually
present, but with different temporal dynamics. These results indicate that
internally generated representations rely on top-down processes, and their
timing is influenced by the predictability of the stimulus.

tool to non-invasively access brain activity. Using fMRI, the functional
connectivity (FC) between brain regions can be inferred, which has contributed
to a number of findings of the fundamental properties of the brain. As an
important clinical application of FC, clustering of subjects based on FC
recently draws much attention, which can potentially reveal important
heterogeneity in subjects such as subtypes of psychiatric disorders. In
particular, a multiple-view clustering method is a powerful analytical tool,
which identifies clustering patterns of subjects depending on their FC in
specific brain areas. However, when one applies an existing multiple-view
clustering method to fMRI data, there is a need to simplify the data structure,
independently dealing with elements in a FC matrix, i.e., vectorizing a
correlation matrix. Such a simplification may distort the clustering results.
To overcome this problem, we propose a novel multiple-view clustering method
based on Wishart mixture models, which preserves the correlation matrix
structure without vectorization. The uniqueness of this method is that the
multiple-view clustering of subjects is based on particular networks of nodes
(or regions of interest, ROIs), optimized in a data-driven manner. Hence, it
can identify multiple underlying pairs of associations between a subject
cluster solution and a ROI sub-network. The key assumption of the method is
independence among sub-networks, which is effectively addressed by whitening
correlation matrices. We applied the proposed method to synthetic and fMRI
data, demonstrating the usefulness and power of the proposed method.

schemes are described in terms of certain interacting chains in which the
interaction is given in terms of the total time occupation measure of all

appropriate fashion, to states where the collection of particles has spent more
time. The schemes can be viewed as combining the key features of the two basic
simulation-based methods for approximating QSD originating from the works of
Fleming and Viot (1979) and Aldous, Flannery and Palacios (1998), respectively.
The key difference between the two schemes studied here is that in the first
method one starts with $a(n)$ particles at time $0$ and number of particles
stays constant over time whereas in the second method we start with one
particle and at most one particle is added at each time instant in such a
manner that there are $a(n)$ particles at time $n$. We prove almost sure
convergence to the unique QSD and establish Central Limit Theorems for the two

Deep learning algorithm is a newly emerged method to solve multi-factors

which make it a powerful tool in energy loss prediction. In this work, we
developed an energy loss prediction model based on deep learning. When
experimental data are available, our model can give predictions with an average
absolute difference close to 5.7%, which is in the same level compared with
other widely used programs e.g. SRIM. In the regime without experimental data,
our model still can maintain a high performance, and has higher reliability
compared with the existing models. The ion range of Au ions in SiC can be
calculated with a relative error of 0.6~25% for ions in the energy range of
700~10'000 keV, which is much better than the results calculated by SRIM.
Moreover, our model support the reciprocity conjecture of ion stopping power in

hardly been proved by any of the existing stopping power models. This
high-accuracy energy loss prediction model is very important for the research

spectra, which are likely to add a new dimension to magnon excitation. Here, we
investigate valley magnon and associated valley modulation in a kagome lattice,
with staggered exchange interaction and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The
staggered exchange interaction breaks spatial inversion symmetry, leading to
gapped degenerate valleys at $\pm K$ and consequent valley magnon Hall effect.
When the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is further included, the valley
degeneracy is lifted. As a result, net magnon anomalous Hall effect and
topological phase transition are realized. More interestingly, by tuning valley
splitting and excitation frequency, heat currents in the kagome strip can be
localized at one edge to achieve single-edge transport. Besides, for the kagmon
lattice, the edge heat currents include local circulating contribution within
triangular fine structure, together with currents flowing parallel to the
edges. These findings give full play to spin and valley degrees of freedom and
enrich energy-efficient magnonic device paradigms.

Pathfinder (ASKAP). Many theoretical models of binary neutron stars mergers
predict that bright, prompt radio emission would accompany the merger. The
detection of such prompt emission would greatly improve our knowledge of the
physical conditions, environment, and location of the merger. However, searches
for prompt emission are complicated by the relatively poor localisation for
gravitational wave events, with the 90\% credible region reaching hundreds or
even thousands of square degrees. Operating in fly's eye mode, the ASKAP field
of view can reach $\sim$1000 deg$^2$ at $\sim 888\,{\rm MHz}$. This potentially
allows observers to cover most of the 90\% credible region quickly enough to
detect prompt emission. We use skymaps for GW170817 and GW190814 from
LIGO/Virgo's third observing run to simulate the probability of detecting
prompt emission for gravitational wave events in the upcoming fourth observing
run. With only alerts released after merger we find it difficult to slew the
telescope sufficiently quickly as to capture any prompt emission. However, with
the addition of alerts released \textit{before} merger by negative-latency
pipelines we find that it should be possible to search for nearby, bright
prompt FRB-like emission from gravitational wave events. Nonetheless, the rates
are low: we would expect to observe $\sim$0.012 events during the fourth
observing run, assuming that the prompt emission is emitted microseconds around
the merger

clouds that address the complexity and objectives of modern, dense laser scans

per area on vertical surfaces); (2) vertical density as a function of
horizontal density; (3) vertical surface accuracy; and a decomposition of error
into (4) within-pass and (5) cross-pass components. Specifically considered is
vertical surface coverage and the practice of overlapping flight passes to
reduce the occlusions and achieve the vertical density needed for
twenty-first-century use cases (e.g. curb and window detection). The
application of these metrics to a quartet of recent urban flyovers demonstrates
their relevance by establishing (1) the efficacy of considering sensor position
and wall height when predicting point density on vertical surfaces; (2) that
cross-pass registration accounts for a disproportionate amount of the vertical
surface error (but not horizontal) and provides a meaningful parameter to
compare high-density, urban point clouds; and (3) that compared to horizontal
density and accuracy, the vertical counterparts are disproportionately impacted
(positively for density and negatively for accuracy) by modern, optimized
flight missions.

image patches to maximize the utility of the powerful sparse data processing
technique for CT image reconstruction. Considering heterogeneous distributions
of image features and noise in CT, region-specific customization of
dictionaries is utilized in iterative reconstruction. Thoracic CT images are
partitioned into several regions according to their structural and noise
characteristics. Dictionaries specific to each region are then learned from the
segmented thoracic CT images and applied to subsequent image reconstruction of
the region. Parameters for dictionary learning and sparse representation are
determined according to the structural and noise properties of each region. The
proposed method results in better performance than the conventional
reconstruction based on a single dictionary in recovering structures and
suppressing noise in both simulation and human CT imaging. Quantitatively, the
simulation study shows maximum improvement of image quality for the whole
thorax can achieve 4.88% and 11.1% in terms of the Structure-SIMilarity (SSIM)
and Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) indices, respectively. For human imaging
data, it is found that the structures in the lungs and heart can be better
recovered, while simultaneously decreasing noise around the vertebra
effectively. The proposed strategy takes into account inherent regional
differences inside of the reconstructed object and leads to improved images.
The method can be readily extended to CT imaging of other anatomical regions
and other applications.

essential to correctly describe high-energy deuteron scattering. The
nucleus-deuteron scattering needs information not only on the nucleus-proton
but also the nucleus-neutron interaction, for which no direct measurement of
the nucleus-neutron cross sections is available for unstable nuclei.
  Purpose: We systematically evaluated the total reaction cross sections by a
deuteron target to explore the feasibility of extracting the nucleus-neutron
interaction from measurable cross sections.
  Methods: High-energy nucleus-deuteron collision is described by the Glauber
model, in which the proton and neutron configuration of the deuteron is
explicitly taken into account.
  Results: Our calculation reproduces available experimental total reaction
cross section data on the nucleus-deuteron scattering. The possibility of
extracting the nucleus-neutron total reaction cross section from
nucleus-deuteron and nucleus-proton total reaction cross sections is explored.
The total reaction cross sections of a nucleus by proton, neutron, and deuteron
targets can be expressed, to good accuracy, in terms of the nuclear matter
radius and neutron skin thickness. Incident-energy dependence of the total
reaction cross sections is examined.
  Conclusions: The total reaction cross section on a deuteron target includes
information on both the nucleus-neutron and nucleus-proton profile functions.
Measuring the cross sections by deuteron and proton targets is a promising tool

is with the Poynting flow computed at large distances (approaching infinity!)
from the time-retarded positions of uniformly accelerated charge, and taken as
an evidence of radiation emitted by the charge, which we shall demonstrate to
be not true. As the charge picks up speed due to a constant acceleration, the
energy in its self-fields accordingly increases and the Poynting flow, usually
inferred as radiation, actually forms part of the requisite energy being fed
into fields, at a rate just sufficient to match the increasing energy in its
self-fields at various distances from the uniformly accelerated charge,

the energy in its self-fields decreases, at all distances from the charge, till
it comes to momentary rest with no energy in its transverse fields, and this
decrease in energy is shown {\em everywhere} by an inward radial flow of the
Poynting vector, toward the `present' position of the decelerating charge.
Moreover, there is a convective flow of self-fields of the charge, seen as a

conditions for a dynamical system to have a valid linear or bilinear
realization over a given set of observable functions are presented and used to
show that every control-affine system admits an infinite-dimensional bilinear
realization, but does not necessarily admit a linear one. Therefore,
approximate bilinear realizations constructed from generic sets of basis
functions tend to improve as the number of basis functions increases, whereas
approximate linear realizations may not. To demonstrate the advantages of
bilinear Koopman realizations for control, a linear, bilinear, and nonlinear
Koopman model realization of a simulated robot arm are constructed from data.
In a trajectory following task, the bilinear realization exceeds the prediction
accuracy of the linear realization and the computational efficiency of the
nonlinear realization when incorporated into a model predictive control

reconstruction has on our AMT model. Our proposed model consists of two U-nets:
the first U-net transcribes the spectrogram into a posteriorgram, and a second
U-net transforms the posteriorgram back into a spectrogram. A reconstruction
loss is applied between the original spectrogram and the reconstructed
spectrogram to constrain the second U-net to focus only on reconstruction. We
train our model on three different datasets: MAPS, MAESTRO, and MusicNet. Our
experiments show that adding the reconstruction loss can generally improve the
note-level transcription accuracy when compared to the same model without the
reconstruction part. Moreover, it can also boost the frame-level precision to
be higher than the state-of-the-art models. The feature maps learned by our
U-net contain gridlike structures (not present in the baseline model) which
implies that with the presence of the reconstruction loss, the model is

incorporating summary-level information from ""external"" models. We propose a
meta-analysis framework along with two weighted estimators as the composite of
empirical Bayes estimators, which combines the estimates from the different
external models. The proposed framework is flexible and robust in the ways that
(i) it is capable of incorporating external models that use a slightly
different set of covariates; (ii) it can identify the most relevant external
information and diminish the influence of information that is less compatible
with the internal data; and (iii) it nicely balances the bias-variance
trade-off while preserving the most efficiency gain. The proposed estimators
are more efficient than the naive analysis of the internal data and other naive
combinations of external estimators.

The key requirement is an approximation property that allows us to embed the
singular drift and diffusion mappings into a hierarchy of regular mappings that
are invariant with respect to the Hilbert space and enjoy a cancellation
property.
  Various nonlinear models in fluid dynamics with transport noise belong to
this type of singular SDEs. With a cancellation estimate for generalized Lie
derivative operators, we can construct such regular approximations for cases
involving the Lie derivative operators, or more generally, differential
operators of order one with suitable coefficients. In particular, we apply the

However, at Facebook's scale of billions of users, a single bug can manifest as
several different symptoms according to the various user and execution

two key aspects: (i) a scalable algorithm to efficiently mine patterns from
telemetric information that is collected along with the reports, and (ii)
statistical notions of precision and recall of patterns that help point towards
root causes. We evaluate Minesweeper's scalability and effectiveness in finding
root causes from symptoms on real world bug and crash reports from Facebook's

Calliope incorporates a new logic-oriented Monte Carlo tree search algorithm

The importance of data facts is measured based on information theory, and each

training and inference has obstructed the development in the field, especially
for large-scale action datasets. In this work, we propose an efficient but
strong baseline based on Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), where three main
improvements are aggregated, i.e., early fused Multiple Input Branches (MIB),
Residual GCN (ResGCN) with bottleneck structure and Part-wise Attention
(PartAtt) block. Firstly, an MIB is designed to enrich informative skeleton
features and remain compact representations at an early fusion stage. Then,
inspired by the success of the ResNet architecture in Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), a ResGCN module is introduced in GCN to alleviate computational
costs and reduce learning difficulties in model training while maintain the
model accuracy. Finally, a PartAtt block is proposed to discover the most
essential body parts over a whole action sequence and obtain more explainable
representations for different skeleton action sequences. Extensive experiments
on two large-scale datasets, i.e., NTU RGB+D 60 and 120, validate that the
proposed baseline slightly outperforms other SOTA models and meanwhile requires
much fewer parameters during training and inference procedures, e.g., at most

system where the preamble sent by each active device is delayed by some unknown

low-temperature applications, due to its high strength, excellent toughness,
and low ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT). Under dynamic loading
conditions this steel is, however, prone to shear localization that manifests
as adiabatic shear bands (ASBs). The temperature increases and thermoplastic
microstructural evolution in the ASB are studied in detail, from the
macroscopic length scale to the atomic-scale employing correlative
electron-backscatter diffraction (EBSD), transmission electron microscopy
(TEM), and atom-probe tomography (APT). From a calculation of the temperature
increase under adiabatic conditions, based on the conversion of plastic-work to
heat generation, the microstructural transitions in the ASB are discussed
specifically for: (i) a b.c.c.-f.c.c. phase-transformation and their elemental
partitioning; (ii) the thermodynamic model for the compositional change of the
V(Nb)-rich carbonitride precipitates during a temperature increase; and (iii)
grain-refinement and rotation by dynamic/mechanical recrystallization
processes. Solute segregation at subgrain boundaries, measured using the
Gibbsian interfacial excess methodology, reveals how solute segregation
contributes to the instability of localized shear-deformation by promoting the
depinning of solute elements and the migration of a grain boundary. Finally, a
kinetic model for grain refinement/rotation within an ASB is described by the
dynamic recrystallization behavior with: (i) subgrain formation; (ii)
rotation/refinement by deformation; and (iii) grain growth by subgrain
coalescence with further rotation and a temperature increase. The temperature
increase under dynamic deformation in an ASB promotes grain boundary migration
and subgrain coalescence to create a large degree of equiaxed grains with a low
density of imperfections.

firstly, we alleviate this extremely data-scarce problem by introducing depth

information to our model; secondly, we fuse the representation of original RGB
clips with multiple non-strictly corresponding depth clips sampled by our
temporal asynchronization augmentation mechanism, which synthesizes new
instances at feature-level; thirdly, a novel Depth Guided Adaptive Instance

report clear evidence for spin-momentum locking in the edge channels of

perpendicular to the tungsten chains at 40$\pm$2{\deg} to the layer normal,
implying that the spin-orbit coupling is inherited from the bulk band
structure. We show that this finding is consistent with theory if the band-edge
orbitals are taken to have like parity. We conclude that this parity assignment
is correct and that both edge states and bulk bands in monolayer WTe2 share the
same simple spin structure. Combined with other known features of the edge
states this establishes spin-momentum locking, and therefore that monolayer

viewpoint. Given point clouds sampled from a reaction dynamics, we construct a
discrete Markov process based on an approximated Voronoi tesselation. We use
the constructed Markov process to compute a discrete committor function whose
level set automatically orders the point clouds. Then based on the committor
function, an optimally controlled random walk on point clouds is constructed
and utilized to efficiently sample transition paths, which become an almost
sure event in $O(1)$ time instead of a rare event in the original reaction
dynamics. To compute the mean transition path efficiently, a local averaging
algorithm based on the optimally controlled random walk is developed, which
adapts the finite temperature string method to the controlled Monte Carlo
samples. Numerical examples on sphere/torus including a conformational
transition for the alanine dipeptide in vacuum are conducted to illustrate the
data-driven solver for the transition path theory on point clouds. The mean

energy challenges including solar fuels synthesis, long-term energy storage,
and renewable fertilizer production. Despite considerable effort by the
catalysis community to apply machine learning models to the computational
catalyst discovery process, it remains an open challenge to build models that
can generalize across both elemental compositions of surfaces and adsorbate
identity/configurations, perhaps because datasets have been smaller in
catalysis than related fields. To address this we developed the OC20 dataset,
consisting of 1,281,040 Density Functional Theory (DFT) relaxations
(~264,890,000 single point evaluations) across a wide swath of materials,
surfaces, and adsorbates (nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen chemistries). We
supplemented this dataset with randomly perturbed structures, short timescale
molecular dynamics, and electronic structure analyses. The dataset comprises
three central tasks indicative of day-to-day catalyst modeling and comes with
pre-defined train/validation/test splits to facilitate direct comparisons with
future model development efforts. We applied three state-of-the-art graph
neural network models (CGCNN, SchNet, Dimenet++) to each of these tasks as
baseline demonstrations for the community to build on. In almost every task, no
upper limit on model size was identified, suggesting that even larger models
are likely to improve on initial results. The dataset and baseline models are
both provided as open resources, as well as a public leader board to encourage
community contributions to solve these important tasks.

Bernstein/B\'ezier Optimal Trajectories (BeBOT), for the generation of

infinite dimensional optimal control formulations of trajectory generation
problems. By approximating the trajectories using Bernstein polynomials, these
problems can be transcribed as nonlinear programming problems, which can then
be solved using off-the-shelf solvers. Bernstein polynomials possess favorable
geometric properties that enable the trajectory planner to efficiently evaluate
and enforce constraints along the vehicles' trajectories, including maximum
speed and angular rates, minimum distance between trajectories and between the
vehicles and obstacles. By virtue of these properties, feasibility and safety
constraints typically imposed in autonomous vehicle operations can be enforced
and guaranteed independently on the order of the polynomials. Thus, the
trajectory generation algorithm can efficiently generate feasible and
collision-free trajectories, and can be deployed for real-time safety critical
applications in complex environments and for multiple vehicle missions.

supervised setting (1 input image, 1 prediction per image). However a very
common scenario in developing countries is to have the volume metadata lost due
multiple reasons for example formatting conversion in images (for example
.dicom to jpg), in this scenario the doctor analyses the collection of images
and then emits a single diagnostic for the patient (with possibly an unfixed
and variable number of images per patient) , this prevents it from being
possible to use state of the art 3d models, but also is not possible to convert
it to a supervised problem in a (1 image,1 diagnostic) setting because
different angles or positions of the images for a single patient may not

curricula has been amply recognized. For many students, however, gaining a good
understanding of algorithms remains a challenge.
  Because of the automated nature of sequential algorithms. there is an
inherent tension in directly applying the `learning by doing' approach. This
partly explains the limitations of efforts like algorithm animation and code
tracing.
  Algodynamics, the approach we propose and advocate, situates algorithms
within the framework of transition systems and their dynamics and offers an
attractive approach for teaching algorithms. Algodynamics starts with the
premise that the key ideas underlying an algorithm can be identified and
packaged into interactive transition systems. The algorithm when `opened up',
reveals a transition system, shorn of most control aspects, enriched instead
with interaction. The design of an algorithm can be carried out by constructing
a series of interactive systems, progressively trading interactivity with
automation. These transition systems constitute a family of notional machines.
  We illustrate the algodynamics approach by considering Bubblesort. A sequence
of five interactive transition systems culminate in the classic Bubblesort
algorithm. The exercise of constructing the individual systems also pays off
when coding Bubblesort: a highly modular implementation whose primitives are
borrowed from the transition systems. The transition systems used for
Bubblesort have been implemented as interactive experiments. These web based
implementations are easy to build. The simplicity and flexibility afforded by
the algodynamics framework makes it an attractive option to teach algorithms in
an interactive way.

to whether a treatment X has a causal effect on an outcome Y. Even if the
instrument Z satisfies the three core IV assumptions of relevance, independence
and the exclusion restriction, further assumptions are required to identify the
average causal effect (ACE) of X on Y. Sufficient assumptions for this include:
homogeneity in the causal effect of X on Y; homogeneity in the association of Z
with X; and no effect modification (NEM). Methods: We describe the NO
Simultaneous Heterogeneity (NOSH) assumption, which requires the heterogeneity
in the X-Y causal effect to be mean independent of (i.e., uncorrelated with)
both Z and heterogeneity in the Z-X association. This happens, for example, if
there are no common modifiers of the X-Y effect and the Z-X association, and
the X-Y effect is additive linear. We illustrate NOSH using simulations and by
re-examining selected published studies. Results: When NOSH holds, the Wald
estimand equals the ACE even if both homogeneity assumptions and NEM (which we
demonstrate to be special cases of - and therefore stronger than - NOSH) are
violated. Conclusions: NOSH is sufficient for identifying the ACE using IVs.

_t \beta (u) - \nabla \cdot \alpha (x , \nabla u) \ni f$ with the homogeneous
Dirichlet boundary condition in a bounded domain, where $\beta : \mathbb{R} \to
2 ^{ \mathbb{R} }$ is a maximal monotone graph satisfying $0 \in \beta (0)$ and
$ \nabla \cdot \alpha (x , \nabla u )$ stands for a generalized $p$-Laplacian.
Existence of solution to the initial boundary value problem of this equation
has been investigated in an enormous number of papers for the case where
single-valuedness, coerciveness, or some growth condition is imposed on $\beta
$. However, there are a few results for the case where such assumptions are
removed and it is difficult to construct an abstract theory which covers the
case for $1 < p < 2$. Main purpose of this paper is to show the solvability of
the initial boundary value problem for any $ p \in (1, \infty ) $ without any
conditions for $\beta $ except $0 \in \beta (0)$. We also discuss the
uniqueness of solution by using properties of entropy solution.

detection, the accuracy of the recent approaches has made stunning progress.
These approaches mainly adopt the sequential modules, based on optical flow or

modules are effective but significantly increase the computational burden of
the corresponding deep models. In this paper, to simplify the network and
maintain the accuracy, we present a lightweight network tailored for video

Specifically, in the spatial aspect, we combine a saliency guidance feature
embedding structure and spatial knowledge distillation to refine the spatial
features. In the temporal aspect, we propose a temporal knowledge distillation
strategy, which allows the network to learn the robust temporal features
through the infer-frame feature encoding and distilling information from
adjacent frames. The experiments on widely used video datasets (e.g., DAVIS,
DAVSOD, SegTrack-V2) prove that our approach achieves competitive performance.
Furthermore, without the employment of the complex sequential modules, the

with its own dataset, learn a global model collaboratively with the help of a
wireless access point acting as the parameter server (PS). At each iteration,
wireless devices perform local updates using their local data and the most
recent global model received from the PS, and send their local updates to the
PS over a wireless fading multiple access channel (MAC). The PS then updates
the global model according to the signal received over the wireless MAC, and
shares it with the devices. Motivated by the additive nature of the wireless
MAC, we propose an analog `over-the-air' aggregation scheme, in which the
devices transmit their local updates in an uncoded fashion. Unlike recent
literature on over-the-air edge learning, here we assume that the devices do
not have channel state information (CSI), while the PS has imperfect CSI.
Instead, the PS is equipped multiple antennas to alleviate the destructive
effect of the channel, exacerbated due to the lack of perfect CSI. We design a
receive beamforming scheme at the PS, and show that it can compensate for the
lack of perfect CSI when the PS has a sufficient number of antennas. We also
derive the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm highlighting the impact
of the lack of perfect CSI, as well as the number of PS antennas. Both the
experimental results and the convergence analysis illustrate the performance
improvement of the proposed algorithm with the number of PS antennas, where the
wireless fading MAC becomes deterministic despite the lack of perfect CSI when
the PS has a sufficiently large number of antennas.

semi-analytically solving the dipolar superfluid hydrodynamics of this system

the nonrotating harmonic trap. This additional degree of freedom manifests
itself in the presence of previously unknown stationary solution branches for

of the trapping geometry, rotation frequency and dipole tilt angle. For
rotation frequencies of at least an order of magnitude higher than the in-plane
trapping frequency, the stationary state density profile is almost perfectly
equivalent to the profile expected in a time-averaged dipolar potential that
effectively vanishes when the dipoles are tilted along the `magic angle', $54.7

hydrodynamics about these stationary states, we find that they are dynamically
unstable against the formation of collective modes, which we expect would

the most efficient Entropy coding algorithm in information theory, such that it

to fully utilize the high memory-bandwidth feature of modern GPU architectures.
The detailed contribution is four-fold. (1) We develop an efficient parallel
codebook construction on GPUs that scales effectively with the number of input

efficiently merge the codewords on GPUs. (3) We optimize the overall GPU
performance by leveraging the state-of-the-art CUDA APIs such as Cooperative

line graph corresponds to a unique edge in the original graph. Therefore, link
prediction problems in the original graph can be equivalently solved as a node
classification problem in its corresponding line graph, instead of a graph
classification task. Experimental results on fourteen datasets from different
applications demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods, while it has fewer parameters and high training
efficiency.

analysis due to the high cost of obtaining and labeling training data. For
example, in the study of gene interaction and regulation in Drosophila
embryogenesis, the analysis is most biologically meaningful when in situ
hybridization (ISH) gene expression pattern images from the same developmental
stage are compared. However, labeling training data with precise stages is very
time-consuming even for evelopmental biologists. Thus, a critical challenge is
how to build accurate computational models for precise developmental stage
classification from limited training samples. In addition, identification and
visualization of developmental landmarks are required to enable biologists to
interpret prediction results and calibrate models. To address these challenges,
we propose a deep two-step low-shot learning framework to accurately classify
ISH images using limited training images. Specifically, to enable accurate
model training on limited training samples, we formulate the task as a deep
low-shot learning problem and develop a novel two-step learning approach,
including data-level learning and feature-level learning. We use a deep
residual network as our base model and achieve improved performance in the
precise stage prediction task of ISH images. Furthermore, the deep model can be
interpreted by computing saliency maps, which consist of pixel-wise
contributions of an image to its prediction result. In our task, saliency maps
are used to assist the identification and visualization of developmental
landmarks. Our experimental results show that the proposed model can not only
make accurate predictions, but also yield biologically meaningful

long-range ordering, high-$T_c$ superconductivity, quantum spin liquid
behavior, topological ordering, a variety of other exotic phases, and quantum
criticalities. Frustrating perturbations in antiferromagnets may give rise to
strong quantum fluctuations, challenging the theoretical understanding of the
many-body ground state. Here we develop a method to describe the quantum
antiferromagnets using fermionic degrees of freedom. The method is based on a
formally exact mapping between spin exchange models and theories describing
fermionic matter with the emergent $U(1)$ Chern-Simons gauge field. For the
planar N\'{e}el state, this mapping self-consistently generates the
Chern-Simons superconductor mean-field ground state of introduced spinless
fermions. We systematically compare the Chern-Simons superconductor state with
the planar N\'{e}el state at the level of collective modes as well as order
parameters. We reveal qualitative and quantitative correspondences between
these two states. We demonstrate that such a construction using the
fractionalized excitations and Chern-Simons gauge field can not only describe
the N\'{e}el order but can also be applied to study quantum spin liquids.
Furthermore, we show that the confinement-deconfinement transitions from the
N\'{e}el order to quantum spin liquids are signaled and characterized by the
instabilities of Chern-Simons superconductors, driven by strong frustration.
The results suggest observing and classifying the descendants of
antiferromagnets, including other ordered states and unconventional
superconductors, as well as emergent quantum spin liquids.

The suspension is composed of neutrally buoyant initially spherical particles
and a Newtonian carrier fluid, and the flow is solved by means of direct
numerical simulations, using a fully Eulerian method based on a one-continuum
formulation. The solid phase is modeled with an incompressible viscous
hyperelastic constitutive relation, and the flow is characterized by three main
dimensionless parameters, namely the solid volume fraction, the Reynolds and
capillary numbers. The dependency of the effective viscosity on these three
quantities is investigated to study the inertial effects on a suspension of
deformable particles. It can be observed that the suspension has a
shear-thinning behavior, and the reduction in effective viscosity for high
shear rates is emphasized in denser configurations. The separate analysis of
the Reynolds and capillary numbers reveal that the effective viscosity depends
more on the capillary than on the Reynolds number. In addition, our simulations
exhibit a consistent tendency for deformable particles to move towards the
center of the channel, where the shear rate is low. This phenomenon is
particularly marked for very dilute suspensions, where a whole region near the
wall is empty of particles. Furthermore, when the volume fraction is increased
this near-wall region is gradually occupied, because of higher mutual particle
interactions. Deformability also plays an important role in the process.
Indeed, at high capillary numbers, particles are more sensitive to shear rate
variations and can modify their shape more easily to accommodate a greater
number of particles in the central region of the channel.

monoidal categories, with various applications in computer science. A state
bootstrapping technique, which has appeared in several different contexts,
yields free such categories. We show that Span(Graph)* arises in this way,
being the free feedback category over Span(Set). Given that the latter can be
seen as an algebra of predicates, the algebra of open transition systems thus

aperiodicity is subject to noisy evolution, then it is generally expected to
result in diffusion and delocalization. In this work, it is shown that the
localized phase of the kicked Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model is robust to the
effects of noisy evolution, for long times, provided that some kick is
delivered once every time period. However, if strong noisy perturbations are
applied by randomly missing kicks, a sharp dynamical transition from a
ballistic growth phase at initial times to a diffusive growth phase for longer
times is observed. Such sharp transitions are seen even in translationally
invariant models. These transitions are related to the existence of flat bands,
and using a 2-band model we obtain analytical support for these observations.
The diffusive evolution at long times has a mechanism similar to that of a
random walk. The time scale at which the sharp transition takes place is
related to the characteristics of noise. Remarkably, the wavepacket evolution
scales with the noise parameters. Further, using kick sequence modulated by a
'coin toss', it is argued that the correlations in the noise are crucial to the
observed sharp transitions.

determined and known by the users who release their data, the specific task in
which the released data is utilized is usually unknown. To address the lack of
information of the specific task, utility constraints laid on a set of possible
tasks are considered. The mechanism protects the privacy while satisfying
utility of all possible tasks in the set. First, the single-letter
characterization of the rate-leakage-distortion region is derived.
Characterization of the minimum leakage under log-loss distortion and
unconstrained released rate turns out to be a non-convex problem. Second,
focusing on the case where the raw data consists of independent components, we
show that the above problem can be decomposed into multiple parallel privacy
funnel (PF) problems with different weightings. We explicitly derive the
solution to each PF problem when the private feature is a deterministic
function of a data component. The solution is characterized by a leakage-free
threshold, and the minimum leakage is zero while the utility constraint is
below the threshold. Finally, we show that the optimal weighting of each PF
problem can be found by solving a linear program (LP). A sufficient released
rate to achieve the minimum leakage is also derived. Numerical results are
shown to illustrate the robustness of our approach against the task
non-specificity. Our results can also be extended to the differential privacy
metric. We show that the problem with multiple constraints can also be
decomposed into multiple single-constraint problems. However, the solution to
each single-constraint problem remains open and can only be solved by numerical

relations between pairs of news items. More precisely, if a user believes two
news items support each other, he will submit a positive vote on the link
between the two items, and if he believes that two news items undermine each
other, he will submit a negative vote on the corresponding link. This approach
has mainly two desirable features: (1) mitigating the effect of personal
preferences on voting, (2) connection of new items to endorsing and disputing
evidence. This approach helps the newsreaders to understand different aspects

blockchain as a distributed transparent manager to encourages users to behave

efficiency for $h^* \geq 0.7$. This is a consequence of the physical origins of
the force production for pitch-dominated ($h^* < 0.5$) and heave-dominated

added-mass-based thrust production where self-propelled efficiency is maximized
for high reduced frequencies, while heave-dominated motions are driven by
circulatory-based thrust production where self-propelled efficiency is
maximized by low reduced frequencies. Regardless of the dimensionless heave
ratio the reduced frequency is high for small amplitude motions, high Lighthill

swimming, the stopping vortex that is shed at the junction of the bursting and

that for CNT subjected to highly energetic processing, it is not sufficient to
analyze only the ID/IG ratio (as proposed in the available literature), but it
is also necessary to evaluate the shifting of the G band, which traces the
amorphization trajectory undergone by the CNT. Furthermore, we observed that
the deformation suffered by the CNT is related to the accumulated strain and
varies with the partial CNT fractions of these composites. This is related to
their capacity to withstand the plastic strain that occurs during deformation.
In addition, the defective state reaches a saturation before achieving the

supply chains which are directly involved in the manufacturing of products that
are critical to alleviating the effects of the health crisis, collectively
referred to as the Crisis-Critical Sector,to unprecedented challenges. Firms
from other sectors, such as automotive, luxury and home appliances, have rushed
into the Crisis-Critical Sector in order to support the effort to upscale
incumbent manufacturing capacities, thereby introducing Intellectual Property
(IP)related dynamics and challenges. We apply an innovation ecosystem
perspective on the Crisis-Critical Sector and adopt a novel visual mapping
approach to identify IP associated challenges and IP specific dynamic
developments during and potentially beyond the crisis.In this paper, we add
methodologically by devising and testing a visual approach to capturing IP
related dynamics in evolving innovation ecosystems and contribute to literature
on IP management in the open innovation context by proposing paraground IP as a
novel IP type.Finally, we also deduce managerial implications for IP management
practitioners at both incumbent firms and new entrants for navigating
innovation ecosystems subject to crisis-induced dynamic shifts.

interest due to its promising coverage and spectral efficiency features.
However, some challenges need to be addressed to realize this technology in
practice. One of the main challenges is the configuration of reflecting
coefficients without the need for beam training overhead or massive channel
estimation. Earlier works used estimated channel information with deep learning
algorithms to design RIS reflection matrices. Although these works can reduce
the beam training overhead, still they overlook existing correlations in the
previously sampled channels. In this paper, different from existing works, we
propose to exploit the correlation in the previously sampled channels to
estimate RIS interaction more reliably. We use a deep multi-layer perceptron
for this purpose. Simulation results reveal performance improvements achieved

Unfortunately, its popularity and openness makes it attractive for unwanted
apps, i.e., malware and potentially unwanted programs (PUP). In Android, app
installations typically happen via the official and alternative markets, but
also via other smaller and less understood alternative distribution vectors
such as Web downloads, pay-per-install (PPI) services, backup restoration,
bloatware, and IM tools. This work performs a thorough investigation on
unwanted app distribution by quantifying and comparing distribution through
different vectors. At the core of our measurements are reputation logs of a
large security vendor, which include 7.9M apps observed in 12M devices between
June and September 2019. As a first step, we measure that between 10% and 24%
of users devices encounter at least one unwanted app, and compare the
prevalence of malware and PUP. An analysis of the who-installs-who
relationships between installers and child apps reveals that the Play market is
the main app distribution vector, responsible for 87% of all installs and 67%
of unwanted app installs, but it also has the best defenses against unwanted
apps. Alternative markets distribute instead 5.7% of all apps, but over 10% of
unwanted apps. Bloatware is also a significant unwanted app distribution vector
with 6% of those installs. And, backup restoration is an unintentional
distribution vector that may even allow unwanted apps to survive users' phone
replacement. We estimate unwanted app distribution via PPI to be smaller than
on Windows. Finally, we observe that Web downloads are rare, but provide a
riskier proposition even compared to alternative markets.

model compression and knowledge transfer. However, currently knowledge
distillation lacks a convincing theoretical understanding. On the other hand,
recent finding on neural tangent kernel enables us to approximate a wide neural
network with a linear model of the network's random features. In this paper, we
theoretically analyze the knowledge distillation of a wide neural network.
First we provide a transfer risk bound for the linearized model of the network.
Then we propose a metric of the task's training difficulty, called data
inefficiency. Based on this metric, we show that for a perfect teacher, a high
ratio of teacher's soft labels can be beneficial. Finally, for the case of
imperfect teacher, we find that hard labels can correct teacher's wrong
prediction, which explains the practice of mixing hard and soft labels.

videos which contain both spatial and temporal variations, and (ii) the
complexity of user utterances which query different segments and/or different
objects in videos over multiple dialogue turns. However, existing approaches to
video-grounded dialogues often focus on superficial temporal-level visual cues,
but neglect more fine-grained spatial signals from videos. To address this
drawback, we propose Bi-directional Spatio-Temporal Learning (BiST), a
vision-language neural framework for high-resolution queries in videos based on
textual cues. Specifically, our approach not only exploits both spatial and
temporal-level information, but also learns dynamic information diffusion
between the two feature spaces through spatial-to-temporal and
temporal-to-spatial reasoning. The bidirectional strategy aims to tackle the
evolving semantics of user queries in the dialogue setting. The retrieved
visual cues are used as contextual information to construct relevant responses
to the users. Our empirical results and comprehensive qualitative analysis show
that BiST achieves competitive performance and generates reasonable responses
on a large-scale AVSD benchmark. We also adapt our BiST models to the Video QA
setting, and substantially outperform prior approaches on the TGIF-QA
benchmark.

equilibrium spin period due to the fallback accretion. The corresponding
accretion rates are inferred as $\dot{M}\approx10^{-4}-10^{-1}$ M$_\odot$

also reach an accretion-induced spin equilibrium, but the corresponding $B-P_0$

accretion, magnetars with relatively weak fields are responsible for the
SLSNe~I, while those with stronger magnetic fields could lead to SNe~Ic/Ic-BL.

approach the Shannon limit. However, it has been proved that conventional
carrier phase recovery (CPR) algorithm designed for uniform distribution may
have extra penalty in PS systems. In this paper, we find that the performance
of QPSK partition algorithm is degenerated when PS is implemented. To solve
this issue, a modified QPSK partition algorithm that jointly optimizes the
amplitude decision threshold and filter weight is proposed, where the
optimization of decision threshold is based on maximum a posterior probability
(MAP) estimation. Different from the conventional decision methods which
commonly use Euclidean distance metric, the MAP-based decision introduces the
statistical characteristics of the received signals to obtain an accurate
amplitude partition. In addition, the filter weight is optimized for different
decision thresholds to enhance the tolerance of ASE-induced phase noise. We
verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithm in a 56 GBaud PS 16-ary
quadrature amplitude modulation (16-QAM) system. The proposed algorithm reduces
the error of phase noise estimation by nearly half. Compared with conventional
QPSK partition, the proposed algorithm could narrow the gap with theoretical
mutual information (MI) by more than 0.1 bit/symbol. The channel capacity is
increased by 4.2%, 4.3% and 3.6% with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) from 8 dB to
10 dB respectively. These observations show that the proposed algorithm is a
promising method to relieve the penalty of QPSK partition algorithm in PS
systems.

reliably capturing van der Waals interaction -- were already conceived in the
1990's. In 2004, a seminal paper introduced the first practical non-local
exchange-correlation functional called vdW-DF, which has become widely
successful and laid the foundation for much further research. However, since
then, the functional form of vdW-DF has remained unchanged. Several successful
modifications paired the original functional with different (local) exchange
functionals to improve performance and the successor vdW-DF2 also updated one
internal parameter. Bringing together different insights from almost two
decades of development and testing, we present the next-generation non-local
correlation functional called vdW-DF3, in which we change the functional form
while staying true to the original design philosophy. Although many popular
functionals show good performance around the binding separation of van der
Waals complexes, they often result in significant errors at larger separations.
With vdW-DF3, we address this problem by taking advantage of a recently
uncovered and largely unconstrained degree of freedom within the vdW-DF
framework that can be constrained through empirical input, making our
functional semi-empirical. For two different parameterizations, we benchmark
vdW-DF3 against a large set of well-studied test cases and compare our results
with the most popular functionals, finding good performance in general for a
wide array of systems and a significant improvement in accuracy at larger
separations. Finally, we discuss the achievable performance within the current
vdW-DF framework, the flexibility in functional design offered by vdW-DF3, as
well as possible future directions for non-local van der Waals density
functional theory.

association between the Corona Australis molecular cloud (CrA), traced by
interstellar dust emission, and two shell-like structures observed with line
emission of atomic hydrogen (HI) at 21 cm. Although the existence of the two
shells had already been reported in the literature, the physical link between
the HI emission and CrA was never highlighted before. We use both Planck and
Herschel data to trace dust emission and the Galactic All Sky HI Survey (GASS)
to trace HI. The physical association between CrA and the shells is assessed
based both on spectroscopic observations of molecular and atomic gas and on
dust extinction data with Gaia. The shells are located at a distance between
140 and 190 pc, comparable to the distance of CrA, which we derive as 150.5 +-
6.3 pc. We also employ dust polarization observations from Planck to trace the
magnetic-field structure of the shells. Both of them show patterns of
magnetic-field lines following the edge of the shells consistently with the
magnetic-field morphology of CrA. We estimate the magnetic-field strength at
the intersection of the two shells via the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi (DCF)
method. Albeit the many caveats that are behind the DCF method, we find a
magnetic-field strength of 27 +- 8 $\mu$G, at least a factor of two larger than
the magnetic-field strength computed off of the HI shells. This value is also
significantly larger compared to the typical values of a few $\mu$G found in
the diffuse HI gas from Zeeman splitting. We interpret this as the result of
magnetic-field compression caused by the shell expansion. This study supports a
scenario of molecular-cloud formation triggered by supersonic compression of
cold magnetized HI gas from expanding interstellar bubbles.

societal disruption was over 100 years ago, when higher education was not a
critical part of society, (ii) not much was known about causes of pandemics,
and hence effective ways of safe operations were not known, and (iii) today
with distance learning, remote operation of an academic institution is
possible. Our approach is unique in presenting a flexible simulation system,
containing a suite of model libraries, one for each major component. The system
integrates agent based modeling (ABM) and stochastic network approach, and
models the interactions among individual entities, e.g., students, instructors,
classrooms, residences, etc. in great detail. For each decision to be made, the
system can be used to predict the impact of various choices, and thus enable
the administrator to make informed decisions. While current approaches are good
for infection modeling, they lack accuracy in social contact modeling. Our ABM
approach, combined with ideas from Network Science, presents a novel approach
to contact modeling. A detailed case study of the University of Minnesota's
Sunrise Plan is presented. For each decisions made, its impact was assessed,
and results used to get a measure of confidence. We believe this flexible tool

While the coupling dependence has been addressed in detail both theoretically
and experimentally for an attractive Fermi gas undergoing the BCS-BEC
crossover, a corresponding study of the temperature dependence of the Josephson
characteristics is still lacking in this context. Here, we investigate the
combined coupling and temperature dependence of the Josephson characteristics
in a systematic way for a wide set of barriers, within ranges of height and
width that can be experimentally explored. Our study smoothly connects the two
limiting cases, of non-overlapping composite bosons at low temperature
described by the Gross-Piatevskii equation, and of strongly overlapping Cooper
pairs near the critical temperature described by the Ginzburg-Landau equation.
In this way, we are able to explore several interesting effects related to how
the current-phase characteristics evolve along the BCS-BEC crossover as a
function of temperature and of barrier shape. These effects include the
coherence length outside the barrier and the pair penetration length inside the
barrier (which is related to the proximity effect), as well as the temperature
evolution of the Landau criterion in the limit of a vanishingly small barrier.
A comparison is also presented between the available experimental data for the
critical current and our theoretical results over a wide range of couplings
along the BCS-BEC crossover.

Microfluidics experiments, however, are accompanied by vast amounts of data,
such as time series of microscopic images, for which manual evaluation is
infeasible due to the sheer number of samples. While classical image processing
technologies do not lead to satisfactory results in this domain, modern deep
learning technologies such as convolutional networks can be sufficiently
versatile for diverse tasks, including automatic cell tracking and counting as
well as the extraction of critical parameters, such as growth rate. However,
for successful training, current supervised deep learning requires label
information, such as the number or positions of cells for each image in a
series; obtaining these annotations is very costly in this setting. Results: We
propose a novel Machine Learning architecture together with a specialized
training procedure, which allows us to infuse a deep neural network with
human-powered abstraction on the level of data, leading to a high-performing
regression model that requires only a very small amount of labeled data.
Specifically, we train a generative model simultaneously on natural and

occurring when torus knots reach the ends of a semi-flexible polymer under
tension. These include decays into simpler knots and total unknotting. The
minimal number of crossings and the minimal knot contour length are the
topological invariants playing a key role in the model. The crossings behave as
particles diffusing along the chain and the application of appropriate boundary
conditions at the ends of the chain accounts for the knot disentanglement.
Starting from the number of particles and their positions, suitable rules allow
reconstructing the type and location of the knot moving on the chain. Our
theory is extensively benchmarked with corresponding Molecular Dynamics
simulations and the results show a remarkable agreement between the simulations

dust grains from the surface of Bennu can be caught in the gravitational field
of Bennu. To this end, we calculated numerically the trajectories of dust
grains of various sizes, from the 0.1mum to the ten millimeter range. The shape
and the fate of an emitted cloud of particles depend on the size of the grains:
smaller grains form a more narrowly confined dust trail while trails formed by
larger grains disperse more rapidly. Four different fates are possible for
ejected dust. All grains with radius less than 1.0mum, directly re-impact on
Bennu or they escape directly. In contrast, a fraction of grains with a radius
larger than 10.0 mum will impact or escape only after performing a number of
non-Keplerian revolutions around Bennu. Our findings show how dust grains may
populate the vicinity of Bennu and other active asteroids and that they can
reach interplanetary space and other celestial bodies, implying that organic

compressing large-scale tensorial data. Existing Tucker decomposition
algorithms usually rely on a single solver to compute the factor matrices and
core tensor, and are not flexible enough to adapt with the diversities of the
input data and the hardware. Moreover, to exploit highly efficient GEMM
kernels, most Tucker decomposition implementations make use of explicit
matricizations, which could introduce extra costs in terms of data conversion
and memory usage. In this paper, we present a-Tucker, a new framework for
input-adaptive and matricization-free Tucker decomposition of dense tensors. A
mode-wise flexible Tucker decomposition algorithm is proposed to enable the
switch of different solvers for the factor matrices and core tensor, and a
machine-learning adaptive solver selector is applied to automatically cope with
the variations of both the input data and the hardware. To further improve the
performance and enhance the memory efficiency, we implement a-Tucker in a fully
matricization-free manner without any conversion between tensors and matrices.
Experiments with a variety of synthetic and real-world tensors show that
a-Tucker can substantially outperform existing works on both CPUs and GPUs.

bidirectional soliton gases: isotropic gases, in which the position shifts
accompanying the head-on and overtaking soliton collisions have the same sign,
and anisotropic gases, in which the position shifts for head-on and overtaking

the collision of two ""monochromatic"" soliton beams consisting of solitons of
approximately the same amplitude and velocity. The corresponding weak solutions
of the kinetic equations consisting of differing uniform states separated by
contact discontinuities for the mean flow are constructed. Concrete examples of
bidirectional Eulerian soliton gases for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\""odinger

fundamental problem with many applications. As computations on dense graphs can
be prohibitively expensive, and it is preferable to perform the computations on
a sparse skeleton of the given graph that roughly preserves the shortest paths
information. Spanners and emulators serve this purpose. This paper develops
fast dynamic algorithms for sparse spanner and emulator maintenance and
provides evidence from fine-grained complexity that these algorithms are tight.
  Under the popular OMv conjecture, we show that there can be no decremental or
incremental algorithm that maintains an $n^{1+o(1)}$ edge (purely additive)
$+n^{\delta}$-emulator for any $\delta<1/2$ with arbitrary polynomial
preprocessing time and total update time $m^{1+o(1)}$. Also, under the
Combinatorial $k$-Clique hypothesis, any fully dynamic combinatorial algorithm
that maintains an $n^{1+o(1)}$ edge $(1+\epsilon,n^{o(1)})$-spanner or emulator
must either have preprocessing time $mn^{1-o(1)}$ or amortized update time
$m^{1-o(1)}$. Both of our conditional lower bounds are tight.
  As the above fully dynamic lower bound only applies to combinatorial
algorithms, we also develop an algebraic spanner algorithm that improves over
the $m^{1-o(1)}$ update time for dense graphs. For any constant $\epsilon\in
(0,1]$, there is a fully dynamic algorithm with worst-case update time
$O(n^{1.529})$ that whp maintains an $n^{1+o(1)}$ edge
$(1+\epsilon,n^{o(1)})$-spanner.
  Our new algebraic techniques and spanner algorithms allow us to also obtain
(1) a new fully dynamic algorithm for All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) with
update and path query time $O(n^{1.9})$; (2) a fully dynamic
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate APSP algorithm with update time $O(n^{1.529})$; (3)

by the classical statistical language model for IR, specifically the query
likelihood model, which assumes that the query is generated as the piece of
text representative of the ""ideal"" document. Based on this idea, we construct
the representative words prediction (ROP) task for pre-training. Given an input
document, we sample a pair of word sets according to the document language
model, where the set with higher likelihood is deemed as more representative of
the document. We then pre-train the Transformer model to predict the pairwise
preference between the two word sets, jointly with the Masked Language Model
(MLM) objective. By further fine-tuning on a variety of representative
downstream ad-hoc retrieval tasks, PROP achieves significant improvements over
baselines without pre-training or with other pre-training methods. We also show
that PROP can achieve exciting performance under both the zero- and

Towards maximizing the communication efficiency, the real-time associations
with orbiting SATs and the moving trajectories of UAVs should be optimized with
suitable FSO/RF links, which is challenging due to the time-varying network
topology and a huge number of possible control actions. To overcome the
difficulty, we lift this problem to multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MARL) with a novel action dimensionality reduction technique. Simulation
results corroborate that our proposed SAT-UAV integrated scheme achieves 1.99x
higher end-to-end sum throughput compared to a benchmark scheme with fixed
ground relays. While improving the throughput, our proposed scheme also aims to
reduce the UAV control energy, yielding 2.25x higher energy efficiency than a

hybrid FSO/RF links, the proposed scheme achieves up to 62.56x higher peak

deposition in tissue, we derive a master equation describing the time evolution
of the probability density function of lethal and potentially lethal DNA damage
induced by radiation in a cell nucleus. The resulting probability distribution
is not required to satisfy any a priori assumption. Furthermore, we generalized
the master equation to consider damage induced by a continuous dose delivery.
In addition, spatial features and damage movement inside the nucleus have been
taken into account. In doing so, we provide a general mathematical setting to
fully describe the spatiotemporal damage formation and evolution in a cell
nucleus. Finally, we provide numerical solutions of the master equation
exploiting Monte Carlo simulations to validate the accuracy of GSM2.
Development of GSM2 can lead to improved modeling of radiation damage to both
tumor and normal tissues, and thereby impact treatment regimens for better
tumor control and reduced normal tissue toxicities.

programming of flight paths. These frameworks provide vendor-dependent
programming and communication interfaces that are intended for flight path
definitions. However, they are often limited to outdoor and GPS-based use only.
A key disadvantage of such a solution is that they are complicated to use and
require readjustments when changing the drone model. This is time-consuming
since it requires redefining the flight path for the new framework. This
workshop paper proposes additional features for DronOS, a community-driven
framework that enables model-independent automatisation and programming of
drones. We enhanced DronOS to include additional functions to account for the
specific design constraints in human-drone-interaction. This paper provides a
starting point for discussing the requirements involved in designing a drone
system with other researchers within the human-drone interaction community. We
envision DronOS as a community-driven framework that can be applied to generic
drone models, hence enabling the automatisation for any commercially available
drone. Our goal is to build DronOS as a software tool that can be easily used

if the intruder, which is modeled as a passive observer, can never infer
confidently that the system is at a secret state. The design objective is to
synthesize a supervisor such that the closed-loop system is opaque even when
the control policy is publicly known. In this paper, we propose a new approach
for enforcing opacity using non-deterministic supervisors. A non-deterministic
supervisor is a decision mechanism that provides a set of control decisions at
each instant, and randomly picks a specific control decision from the decision
set to actually control the plant. Compared with the standard deterministic
control mechanism, such a non-deterministic control mechanism can enhance the
plausible deniability of the controlled system as the online control decision
is a random realization and cannot be implicitly inferred from the control
policy. We provide a sound and complete algorithm for synthesizing a
non-deterministic opacity-enforcing supervisor. Furthermore, we show that
non-deterministic supervisors are strictly more powerful than deterministic
supervisors in the sense that there may exist a non-deterministic

to a surging interest in federated learning (FL) which focuses on collaborative
training of deep neural networks (DNNs) via first-order optimization
techniques. However, some common machine learning tasks such as hyperparameter
tuning of DNNs lack access to gradients and thus require zeroth-order/black-box
optimization. This hints at the possibility of extending BO to the FL setting
(FBO) for agents to collaborate in these black-box optimization tasks. This
paper presents federated Thompson sampling (FTS) which overcomes a number of
key challenges of FBO and FL in a principled way: We (a) use random Fourier
features to approximate the Gaussian process surrogate model used in BO, which
naturally produces the parameters to be exchanged between agents, (b) design
FTS based on Thompson sampling, which significantly reduces the number of
parameters to be exchanged, and (c) provide a theoretical convergence guarantee
that is robust against heterogeneous agents, which is a major challenge in FL

research has focused on extracting flows in given procedures or understanding
the procedures in order to answer conceptual questions. Identifying and
extracting multiple procedures automatically from documents of diverse formats

Analyzing documents to extract the relevant linguistic and structural

analysis. We first implemented and deployed unsupervised techniques which were
used in different use cases. Based on the evaluation in different use cases, we
figured out the weaknesses of the unsupervised approach. We then designed an
improved version which was supervised. We demonstrate that our technique is

interior eigenvalue problems. However, the solution of many large linear
systems with multiple right hand sides may prove a prohibitive computational
expense. The number of right hand sides, and thus, computational cost may be
reduced if the projected subspace is created using multiple moments. In this
work, we explore heuristics for the choice and application of moments with
respect to various other important parameters in a contour integration scheme.
We provide evidence for the expected performance, accuracy, and robustness of
various schemes, showing that good heuristic choices can provide a scheme
featuring good properties in all three of these measures.

the number of network layers in the feature extraction stage to learn deeper
features. In the decoding stage, by fusing the features of the encoding,
upsampling, and decoding parts, Claw UNet can achieve effective segmentation in
the fine-grained regions of scleral blood vessels. To effectively extract small

Bernstein turbulence. The excitation of the small amplitude kinetic waves due

India, the UK, and the US. Our scans gather data from both application (URLs

that HTTPS security inconsistencies are strongly related to URLs and IPs
diversity among regions, and to a lesser extent to the presence of

of n = 1 HCs with m/n = 2/1 TMs based on the experimental observations and a
simple quasi-linear MHD model. In the previous study, it was reported that a
""coupling"" on the phase of the MHD mode is observed between n = 1 HCs and m/n =
2/1 TMs. In this study, it is found that the coupling is observed with the mode
frequency from several Hz to 6 kHz. This indicates that the resistive wall and
the plasma control system do not induce the coupling because the both time
scales are different from the mode frequency. In addition, n = 1 HCs appear to
be the non-resonant mode from the two observations: n = 1 HCs do not rotate
with the plasma around the q = 1 surface in the core and the coupling is also
observed even when qmin > 1. It is also observed that the electron fluctuation
due to an n = 1 HC in the core region disappears with the stabilization of an
m/n = 2/1 neoclassical tearing mode by electron cyclotron current drive,
implying that n = 1 HCs are driven by m/n = 2/1 TMs. This perspective, n = 1
HCs are driven by m/n = 2/1 TMs, is supported by the observation that the
saturated amplitude of the m/n = 1/1 component of the radial displacement in
the core is smaller than that of the m/n = 2/1 component. Finally, we revisit a
quasi-linear MHD model where the m/n = 1/1 HC is induced directly by the
sideband of the current for the m/n = 2/1 TM, which allows to excite the
non-resonant m/n = 1/1 mode. The model also describes the characteristic of the
coupling, fm/n=1/1(HC) = 2fm/n=2/1(TM).

applied in a variety of applications ranging from medical imaging to automotive
LiDAR systems. Over the last few years, improvements of the sensor performance
are gradually approaching to a saturation. In this work we present our new
concept to overcome the intrinsic limitations of planar configurations of
electrodes. Our non-planar technology is based on focusing and enhancing the
electric fields by tip-like electrodes. The shape of the electric field and the
lack of typical micro-cell edges, allows us to exclude cell separation
boundaries and eliminate dead space around active cell areas. Our design
provides a high-density micro-cell layout with a high geometric efficiency. It
resolves the well-known trade-off between the detection efficiency and the
dynamic range. The first ""Tip Avalanche Photodiode"" (TAPD) prototypes show a
remarkable geometric efficiency above 80% for a micro-cell pitch of
15$\mathrm{\mu}$m. This directly translates into a photon detection efficiency
(PDE) record peak value of 73% at 600nm with respect to the state-of-the-art
SiPMs. Moreover, the PDE remains above a value of 45% up to a wavelength of
800nm with another record value of 22% at 905nm. The reduced micro-cell
capacity allows for a fast recovery time below 4ns, which improves the
operation at high photon rates. Overall, the TAPD is anticipated to be a very
promising SiPM generation for various wide-spectral and high-dynamic-range
applications in health science, biophysics, particle physics and LiDARs.

configurations of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) is required for understanding
and eventually predicting solar eruptions. Only two, but seemingly disparate,
magnetic configurations are considered viable; namely, sheared magnetic arcades
(SMA) and magnetic flux ropes (MFR). They can form via three physical
mechanisms (flux emergence, flux cancellation, helicity condensation) . Whether
the CME culprit is an SMA or an MFR, however, has been strongly debated for
thirty years. We formed an International Space Science Institute (ISSI) team to
address and resolve this issue and report the outcome here. We review the
status of the field across modeling and observations, identify the open and
closed issues, compile lists of SMA and MFR observables to be tested against
observations and outline research activities to close the gaps in our current
understanding. We propose that the combination of multi-viewpoint multi-thermal
coronal observations and multi-height vector magnetic field measurements is the
optimal approach for resolving the issue conclusively. We demonstrate the
approach using MHD simulations and synthetic coronal images.
  Our key conclusion is that the differentiation of pre-eruptive configurations
in terms of SMAs and MFRs seems artificial. Both observations and modeling can
be made consistent if the pre-eruptive configuration exists in a hybrid state
that is continuously evolving from an SMA to an MFR. Thus, the 'dominant'
nature of a given configuration will largely depend on its evolutionary stage
(SMA-like early-on, MFR-like near the eruption).

  Optimization Problems",,,,,"cs.MA cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs) are a widely studied
framework for coordinating interactions in cooperative multi-agent systems. In
classical DCOPs, variables owned by agents are assumed to be discrete. However,
in many applications, such as target tracking or sleep scheduling in sensor
networks, continuous-valued variables are more suitable than discrete ones. To
better model such applications, researchers have proposed Continuous DCOPs
(C-DCOPs), an extension of DCOPs, that can explicitly model problems with
continuous variables. The state-of-the-art approaches for solving C-DCOPs
experience either onerous memory or computation overhead and unsuitable for
non-differentiable optimization problems. To address this issue, we propose a
new C-DCOP algorithm, namely Particle Swarm Optimization Based C-DCOP (PCD),
which is inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a well-known
centralized population-based approach for solving continuous optimization
problems. In recent years, population-based algorithms have gained significant
attention in classical DCOPs due to their ability in producing high-quality
solutions. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, this class of algorithms
has not been utilized to solve C-DCOPs and there has been no work evaluating
the potential of PSO in solving classical DCOPs or C-DCOPs. In light of this
observation, we adapted PSO, a centralized algorithm, to solve C-DCOPs in a
decentralized manner. The resulting PCD algorithm not only produces
good-quality solutions but also finds solutions without any requirement for
derivative calculations. Moreover, we design a crossover operator that can be
used by PCD to further improve the quality of solutions found. Finally, we
theoretically prove that PCD is an anytime algorithm and empirically evaluate
PCD against the state-of-the-art C-DCOP algorithms in a wide variety of
benchmarks.

propose optimistic search methods with $O(\log n)$ evaluations exploiting
specific structure of the gain function.
  Towards solid understanding of our strategy, we investigate in detail the
$p$-dimensional Gaussian changing means setup, including high-dimensional
scenarios. For some of our proposals, we prove asymptotic minimax optimality
for detecting change points and derive their asymptotic localization rate.
These rates (up to a possible log factor) are optimal for the univariate and
multivariate scenarios, and are by far the fastest in the literature under the
weakest possible detection condition on the signal-to-noise ratio in the
high-dimensional scenario. Computationally, our proposed methodology has the
worst case complexity of $O(np)$, which can be improved to be sublinear in $n$

overall outcome of the cycle, but also the stage-specific responses, can be
useful. This could be done by developing separate models for each response
variable, but recent work has suggested that it may be advantageous to use a
multivariate approach to model all outcomes simultaneously. Here, joint
analysis of the sequential responses is complicated by mixed outcome types
defined at two levels (patient and embryo). A further consideration is whether
and how to incorporate information about the response at each stage in models
for subsequent stages. We develop a case study using routinely collected data
from a large reproductive medicine unit in order to investigate the feasibility
and potential utility of multivariate prediction in IVF. We consider two
possible scenarios. In the first, stage-specific responses are to be predicted
prior to treatment commencement. In the second, responses are predicted
dynamically, using the outcomes of previous stages as predictors. In both
scenarios, we fail to observe benefits of joint modelling approaches compared

efforts made by a few scientific communities and the relevant results obtained
so far, there are still many issues only partially solved, that ask for general
and quantitative methodologies to be addressed. A prominent aspect of
scientific and practical relevance is how to characterize the mobility behavior
of individuals. In this article, we look at the problem from a location-centric
perspective: we investigate methods to extract, classify and quantify the
symbolic locations specified in telco trajectories, and use such measures to
feature user mobility. A major contribution is a novel trajectory summarization
technique for the extraction of the locations of interest, i.e. attractive,
from symbolic trajectories. The method is built on a density-based trajectory
segmentation technique tailored to telco data, which is proven to be robust
against noise. To inspect the nature of those locations, we combine the two
dimensions of location attractiveness and frequency into a novel location
taxonomy, which allows for a more accurate classification of the visited
places. Another major contribution is the selection of suitable entropy-based
metrics for the characterization of single trajectories, based on the diversity
of the locations of interest. All these components are integrated in a
framework utilized for the analysis of 100,000+ telco trajectories. The
experiments show how the framework manages to dramatically reduce data
complexity, provide high-quality information on the mobility behavior of people

deal with special sampling sets such as sparse grids or rank-1 lattices. This
requires black-box access to the function, i.e., the ability to evaluate it at
any point. Here, we focus on scattered data points and grouped frequency index
sets along the dimensions. From there we propose a fast matrix-vector
multiplication, the grouped Fourier transform, for high-dimensional grouped
index sets. Those transformations can be used in the application of the
previously introduced method of approximating functions with low superposition
dimension based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA) decomposition where there
is a one-to-one correspondence from the ANOVA terms to our proposed groups. The
method is able to dynamically detected important sets of ANOVA terms in the
approximation. In this paper, we consider the involved least-squares problem
and add different forms of regularization: Classical Tikhonov-regularization,
namely, regularized least squares and the technique of group lasso, which
promotes sparsity in the groups. As for the latter, there are no explicit
solution formulas which is why we applied the fast iterative
shrinking-thresholding algorithm to obtain the minimizer. Moreover, we discuss
the possibility of incorporating smoothness information into the least-squares
problem. Numerical experiments in under-, overdetermined, and noisy settings
indicate the applicability of our algorithms. While we consider periodic

component of model-based control for sophisticated robots such as robots driven
by hydraulics, artificial muscles, or robots dealing with different contact
situations. Analytic models to such processes are often unavailable or
inaccurate due to complex hysteresis effects, unmodelled friction and stiction
phenomena,and unknown effects during contact situations. A promising approach
is to obtain spatio-temporal models in a data-driven way using recurrent neural
networks, as they can overcome those issues. However, such models often do not
meet accuracy demands sufficiently, degenerate in performance for the required
high sampling frequencies and cannot provide uncertainty estimates. We adopt a
recent probabilistic recurrent neural network architecture, called Re-current
Kalman Networks (RKNs), to model learning by conditioning its transition
dynamics on the control actions. RKNs outperform standard recurrent networks
such as LSTMs on many state estimation tasks. Inspired by Kalman filters, the
RKN provides an elegant way to achieve action conditioning within its recurrent
cell by leveraging additive interactions between the current latent state and
the action variables. We present two architectures, one for forward model
learning and one for inverse model learning. Both architectures significantly
outperform exist-ing model learning frameworks as well as analytical models in
terms of prediction performance on a variety of real robot dynamics models.

However, their practical use in fiber-based quantum communication depends

present a temperature-dependent study on single QD emission and single-photon
emission from metalorganic vapour-phase epitaxy-grown InGaAs/GaAs QDs emitting

holes in the vicinity of a QD act as reservoir of carriers that can be
exploited to enhance photoluminescence from trion states observed at elevated
temperatures up to at least 80 K. The luminescence quenching is mainly related
to the promotion of holes to higher states in the valence band and this aspect
must be primarily addressed in order to further increase the thermal stability
of emission. Photon autocorrelation measurements yield single photon emission
with a purity of $g_{50\mathrm{K}}^{(2)}\left(0\right)=0.13$ up to 50 K. Our
results imply that these nanostructures are very promising candidates for

performing the SR of a clinical CT into the resolution level of a micro CT
($\mu$CT). The precise non-invasive diagnosis of lung cancer typically utilizes
clinical CT data. Due to the resolution limitations of clinical CT (about $0.5
\times 0.5 \times 0.5$ mm$^3$), it is difficult to obtain enough pathological
information such as the invasion area at alveoli level. On the other hand,
$\mu$CT scanning allows the acquisition of volumes of lung specimens with much
higher resolution ($50 \times 50 \times 50 \mu {\rm m}^3$ or higher). Thus,
super-resolution of clinical CT volume may be helpful for diagnosis of lung
cancer. Typical SR methods require aligned pairs of low-resolution (LR) and
high-resolution (HR) images for training. Unfortunately, obtaining paired
clinical CT and $\mu$CT volumes of human lung tissues is infeasible.
Unsupervised SR methods are required that do not need paired LR and HR images.
In this paper, we create corresponding clinical CT-$\mu$CT pairs by simulating
clinical CT images from $\mu$CT images by modified CycleGAN. After this, we use
simulated clinical CT-$\mu$CT image pairs to train an SR network based on
SRGAN. Finally, we use the trained SR network to perform SR of the clinical CT
images. We compare our proposed method with another unsupervised SR method for
clinical CT images named SR-CycleGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method can successfully perform SR of clinical CT images of lung
cancer patients with $\mu$CT level resolution, and quantitatively and
qualitatively outperformed conventional method (SR-CycleGAN), improving the
SSIM (structure similarity) form 0.40 to 0.51.

(PSP) was the presence of magnetic switchbacks, whose deflections dominated the
magnetic field measurements. Determining their shape and size could provide
evidence of their origin, which is still unclear. Previous work with a single
solar wind stream has indicated that these are long, thin structures although
the direction of their major axis could not be determined. We investigate if
this long, thin nature extends to other solar wind streams, while determining
the direction along which the switchbacks within a stream were aligned. We try
to understand how the size and orientation of the switchbacks, along with the
flow velocity and spacecraft trajectory, combine to produce the observed
structure durations for past and future orbits. We searched for the alignment
direction that produced a combination of a spacecraft cutting direction and
switchback duration that was most consistent with long, thin structures. The
expected form of a long, thin structure was fitted to the results of the best
alignment direction, which determined the width and aspect ratio of the
switchbacks for that stream. The switchbacks had a mean width of $50,000 \,
\rm{km}$, with an aspect ratio of the order of $10$. We find that switchbacks
are not aligned along the background flow direction, but instead aligned along
the local Parker spiral, perhaps suggesting that they propagate along the
magnetic field. Since the observed switchback duration depends on how the
spacecraft cuts through the structure, the duration alone cannot be used to
determine the size or influence of an individual event. For future PSP orbits,
a larger spacecraft transverse component combined with more radially aligned
switchbacks will lead to long duration switchbacks becoming less common.

explosion mechanism accounts for the misalignment of the post-kick jets axis

field over 15 years (centred on solar cycle 23). The flux emergence profile was
extracted from solar synoptic maps and used as input for a photospheric flux

synthesise spectropolarimetric data from the simulated maps and reconstruct
them using ZDI. The ZDI observed solar cycle is set into the context of other
cool star observations and we present observable trends of the magnetic field
topology with time, sunspot number and S-index. We find that the axisymmetric
energy fraction is the best parameter of the ZDI detectable large-scale field
to trace solar-like cycles. Neither the surface averaged large-scale field or
the total magnetic energy is appropriate. ZDI seems also to be able to recover
the increase of the toroidal energy with S-index. We see further that ZDI might

This challenge can be addressed by employing many-body perturbation theory to
obtain the optical absorption spectra of defected transition metal
dichalcogenides. Herein metal vacancies, which are largely unreported, show a
larger set of polarized exitons than chalcogenide vacancies, introducing
localized excitons in the sub-optical-gap region, whose wave functions and
spectra make them good candidates as quantum emitters. Despite the strong
interaction with substitutional defects, the spin texture and pristine exciton
energies are preserved, enabling grafting and patterning in optical detectors,
as the full optical-gap region remains available. A redistribution of excitonic
weight between the A and B excitons is visible in both cases and may allow the
quantification of the defect concentration. This work establishes excitonic
signatures to characterize defects in 2D materials and highlights vacancies as

remains a challenging task. The pollution error (i.e. the discrepancy between
the numerical and analytical wave number k) requires the mesh resolution to be
kept fine enough to obtain accurate solutions. A recent study showed that the
use of Isogeometric Analysis (IgA) for the spatial discretization significantly
reduces the pollution error.
  However, solving the resulting linear systems by means of a direct solver
remains computationally expensive when large wave numbers or multiple
dimensions are considered. An alternative lies in the use of (preconditioned)
Krylov subspace methods. Recently, the use of the exact Complex Shifted
Laplacian Preconditioner (CSLP) with a small complex shift has shown to lead to
wave number independent convergence while obtaining more accurate numerical
solutions using IgA.
  In this paper, we propose the use of deflation techniques combined with an
approximated inverse of the CSLP using a geometric multigrid method. Numerical
results obtained for both one- and two-dimensional model problems, including
constant and non-constant wave numbers, show scalable convergence with respect
to the wave number and approximation order p of the spatial discretization.
Furthermore, when kh is kept constant, the proposed approach leads to a
significant reduction of the computational time compared to the use of the
exact inverse of the CSLP with a small shift.

the injection of a proton-electron plasma from stellar winds within the host
galaxy into initially pair plasma jets, with mean stellar mass-losses ranging
from $10^{-14}$ to $10^{-9}\,{M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}$. The spatial jet evolution
covers $\sim 500\,{\rm pc}$ from jet injection in the grid at 10~pc from the
jet nozzle. Our simulations use a relativistic gas equation of state and a
pressure profile for the ambient medium. We compare these simulations with
previous dynamical simulations of relativistic, non-magnetised jets. Our
results show that toroidal magnetic fields can prevent fast jet expansion and
the subsequent embedding of further stars via magnetic tension. In this sense,
magnetic fields avoid a runaway deceleration process. Furthermore, when the
mass-load is large enough to increase the jet density and produce fast,
differential jet expansion, the conversion of magnetic energy flux into kinetic
energy flux (i.e., magnetic acceleration), helps to delay the deceleration
process with respect to non-magnetised jets. We conclude that the typical
stellar population in elliptical galaxies cannot explain jet deceleration in
classical FRI radio galaxies. However, we observe a significant change in the
jet composition, thermodynamical parameters and energy dissipation along its
evolution, even for moderate values of the mass-load.

a joint set of bilingual corpora which is acutely English-centric (i.e. English
either as the source or target language). While direct data between two
languages that are non-English is explicitly available at times, its use is not
common. In this paper, we first take a step back and look at the commonly used
bilingual corpora (WMT), and resurface the existence and importance of implicit
structure that existed in it: multi-way alignment across examples (the same
sentence in more than two languages). We set out to study the use of multi-way
aligned examples to enrich the original English-centric parallel corpora. We
reintroduce this direct parallel data from multi-way aligned corpora between
all source and target languages. By doing so, the English-centric graph expands
into a complete graph, every language pair being connected. We call MNMT with
such connectivity pattern complete Multilingual Neural Machine Translation
(cMNMT) and demonstrate its utility and efficacy with a series of experiments
and analysis. In combination with a novel training data sampling strategy that
is conditioned on the target language only, cMNMT yields competitive
translation quality for all language pairs. We further study the size effect of
multi-way aligned data, its transfer learning capabilities and how it eases
adding a new language in MNMT. Finally, we stress test cMNMT at scale and
demonstrate that we can train a cMNMT model with up to 111*112=12,432 language
pairs that provides competitive translation quality for all language pairs.

use a repulsion term built from negative pairs in its training objective. Yet,
it avoids collapse to a trivial, constant representation. Thus, it has recently
been hypothesized that batch normalization (BN) is critical to prevent collapse

information about negative views in the batch, which could act as an implicit
negative (contrastive) term. However, we experimentally show that replacing BN
with a batch-independent normalization scheme (namely, a combination of group
normalization and weight standardization) achieves performance comparable to
vanilla BYOL ($73.9\%$ vs. $74.3\%$ top-1 accuracy under the linear evaluation

through multi-regional programs, reformulation of the same drug, or previous
trials for a drug under the same class. Statistical designs that borrow
information from historical data can reduce cost, speed up drug development,
and maintain safety. Purpose -- Based on a hybrid design that partly uses
probability models and partly uses algorithmic rules for decision making, we
aim to improve the efficiency of the dose-finding trials in the presence of
historical data, maintain safety for patients, and achieve a level of
simplicity for practical applications. Methods -- We propose the Hi3+3 design,
in which the letter ""H"" represents ""historical data"". We apply the idea in
power prior to borrow historical data and define the effective sample size
(ESS) of the prior. Dose-finding decision rules follow the idea in the i3+3
design while incorporating the historical data via the power prior and ESS. The
proposed Hi3+3 design pretabulates the dosing decisions before the trial
starts, a desirable feature for ease of application in practice. Results -- The
Hi3+3 design is superior than the i3+3 design due to information borrow from
historical data. It is capable of maintaining a high level of safety for trial
patients without sacrificing the ability to identify the correct MTD.
Illustration of this feature are found in the simulation results. Conclusion --
With the demonstrated safety, efficiency, and simplicity, the Hi3+3 design
could be a desirable choice for dose-finding trials borrowing historical data.

for gravitation on a Lorentzian manifold, inspired from the 1+3 and 3+1
formalisms of general relativity. We first show that the freedom on the
coordinate velocity of a general time-parametrised coordinate system with
respect to a Galilean reference system is similar to the shift freedom in the
3+1-formalism of general relativity. This allows us to write Newton's theory as
living in a 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold $M^N$. This manifold can be
chosen to be curved depending on the dynamics of the Newtonian fluid. In this
paper, we focus on a specific choice for $M^N$ leading to what we call the
\textit{1+3-Newton equations}. We show that these equations can be recovered
from general relativity with a Newtonian limit performed in the rest frames of
the relativistic fluid. The 1+3 formulation of the Newton equations along with
the Newtonian limit we introduce also allow us to define a dictionary between
Newton's theory and general relativity. This dictionary is defined in the rest
frames of the dust fluid, i.e. a non-accelerating observer. A consequence of
this is that it is only defined for irrotational fluids. As an example
supporting the 1+3-Newton equations and our dictionary, we show that the
parabolic free-fall solution in 1+3-Newton exactly translates into the
Schwarzschild spacetime, and this without any approximations. The dictionary
might then be an additional tool to test the validity of Newtonian solutions
with respect to general relativity. It however needs to be further tested for
non-vacuum, non-stationary and non-isolated Newtonian solutions, as well as to
be adapted for rotational fluids. One of the main applications we consider for
the 1+3 formulation of Newton's equations is to define new models suited for
the study of backreaction and global topology in cosmology.

seismic and medical imaging, image processing, and neural networks. Temporal
blocking is a performance optimization that aims to reduce the required memory
bandwidth of stencil computations by re-using data from the cache for multiple
time steps. It has already been shown to be beneficial for this class of
algorithms. However, applying temporal blocking to practical applications'
stencils remains challenging. These computations often consist of sparsely
located operators not aligned with the computational grid (""off-the-grid""). Our
work is motivated by modeling problems in which source injections result in
wavefields that must then be measured at receivers by interpolation from the
grided wavefield. The resulting data dependencies make the adoption of temporal
blocking much more challenging. We propose a methodology to inspect these data
dependencies and reorder the computation, leading to performance gains in
stencil codes where temporal blocking has not been applicable. We implement
this novel scheme in the Devito domain-specific compiler toolchain. Devito
implements a domain-specific language embedded in Python to generate optimized
partial differential equation solvers using the finite-difference method from
high-level symbolic problem definitions. We evaluate our scheme using isotropic
acoustic, anisotropic acoustic, and isotropic elastic wave propagators of
industrial significance. After auto-tuning, performance evaluation shows that
this enables substantial performance improvement through temporal blocking over
highly-optimized vectorized spatially-blocked code of up to 1.6x.

analysis highlights the differences in mobility patterns of the users of

  recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR cs.SD eess.AS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  State-of-the-art music recommendation systems are based on collaborative
filtering, which predicts a user's interest from his listening habits and
similarities with other users' profiles. These approaches are agnostic to the
song content, and therefore face the cold-start problem: they cannot recommend
novel songs without listening history. To tackle this issue, content-aware
recommendation incorporates information about the songs that can be used for
recommending new items. Most methods falling in this category exploit either
user-annotated tags, acoustic features or deeply-learned features.
Consequently, these content features do not have a clear musical meaning, thus
they are not necessarily relevant from a musical preference perspective. In
this work, we propose instead to leverage a model of musical preference which
originates from the field of music psychology. From low-level acoustic features
we extract three factors (arousal, valence and depth), which have been shown
appropriate for describing musical taste. Then we integrate those into a
collaborative filtering framework for content-aware music recommendation.
Experiments conducted on large-scale data show that this approach is able to
address the cold-start problem, while using a compact and meaningful set of

improved by including higher dimensional operators to reflect the UV physics of

and $SU(4)$ gauge theory with fundamental and sextet quarks. In each case, the

ubiquitous, making buildings more livable, energy efficient, and sustainable.
These devices sense the environment and generate multivariate temporal data of
paramount importance for detecting anomalies and improving the prediction of
energy usage in smart buildings. However, detecting these anomalies in
centralized systems is often plagued by a huge delay in response time. To
overcome this issue, we formulate the anomaly detection problem in a federated
learning setting by leveraging the multi-task learning paradigm, which aims at
solving multiple tasks simultaneously while taking advantage of the
similarities and differences across tasks. We propose a novel privacy-by-design
federated learning model using a stacked long short-time memory (LSTM) model,
and we demonstrate that it is more than twice as fast during training
convergence compared to the centralized LSTM. The effectiveness of our
federated learning approach is demonstrated on three real-world datasets
generated by the IoT production system at General Electric Current smart
building, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline methods
in both classification and regression tasks. Our experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in reducing the overall
training cost without compromising the prediction performance.

insulating domain is not always a predictor of a certain non-trivial
higher-order topological invariant, even though they appear to co-exist in the
same Hamiltonian parameter space. Our analysis of $C^n$-symmetric crystalline
insulators and their multi-layer stacks reveals that topological corner states
are not necessarily correlated with other well-established higher-order
boundary observables, such as fractional corner charge or filling anomaly. In a
$C^3$-symmetric breathing Kagome lattice, for example, we show that the bulk
polarization, which successfully predicts the fractional corner anomaly, fails
to be the relevant topological invariant for zero-energy corner states;
instead, these corner states can be exactly explained by the decoration of
topological edges. Also, while the zero-energy corner states in $C^4$-symmetric
topological crystalline insulators have long been conjectured to be the result
of the bulk polarization at quarter-filling, we correct this misconception by
introducing a proper bulk invariant at half-filling and establishing a precise
bulk-corner correspondence. By refining several bulk-corner correspondences in
two-dimensional topological crystalline insulators, our work motivates further
development of rigorous theoretical grounds for associating the existence of
corner states with higher-order topology of host materials.

so-called zigzag mapping under maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding was known to be
asymptotically optimal, but the problem of determining the optimal index

all SNRs. It is further proved that the same optimality results also hold under
minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) decoding. Numerical results are presented to

of trends in the electron heat flux signatures near the Sun. The magnitude of
the heat flux is anticorrelated with solar wind speed, likely as a result of
the lower saturation heat flux in the higher-speed wind. When divided by the
saturation heat flux, the resulting normalized net heat flux is anticorrelated
with plasma beta on all PSP orbits, which is consistent with the operation of
collisionless heat flux regulation mechanisms. The net heat flux also decreases
in very high beta regions in the vicinity of the heliospheric current sheet,
but in most cases of this type the omnidirectional suprathermal electron flux
remains at a comparable level or even increases, seemingly inconsistent with
disconnection from the Sun. The measured heat flux values appear inconsistent
with regulation primarily by collisional mechanisms near the Sun. Instead, the
observed heat flux dependence on plasma beta and the distribution of
suprathermal electron parameters are both consistent with theoretical

uncertainty in the spatial correlation to be utilised in the modelling. The
first enumeration algorithm utilises dynamic programming on a tree
decomposition, and has polynomial time precalculation and linear delay if both

evidencea co-solvency effect with a better solvation of the complex

Overall the gel viscoelasticity can be accounted for by a unique characteristic

characterized by the magnetic ordering transition at Curie temperature TC and
the transition between two different ferromagnetic phases TFM, accompanied by a
structure transition from monoclinic to triclinic symmetry upon cooling. The

deaths minus the baseline, the definition of which varies from country to
country. In the UK it is the average number of deaths over the last five years,
in Germany it is over the last four years and in Belgium over the last 11
years. This means that in all cases the individual baselines depend strongly on
the timing and intensity of adverse factors such as past influenza epidemics
and heat waves. This makes cross-country comparisons difficult. A baseline
defined as the number the number of deaths in the absence of adverse factors
can be operationalized by taking say the 10\% quantile of the number of deaths.
This varies little over time and European countries within given age groups. It
therefore enables more robust and accurate comparisons of different countries.
The article criticizes the use of Z-scores which distort the comparison between
countries. Finally the problem of describing past epidemics by their timing,
that is start and finish and time of the maximum, and by their effect, the
height of the maximum and the total number of deaths, is considered.

well presented for decades in the literature. However, the residual patterns
due to errors in the pulsar acceleration have not been reported previously,
while a pulsar in the galaxy or a globular cluster (GC) will be unavoidably
accelerated. The coupling effect of the pulsar transverse acceleration and the
R$\rm{\ddot{o}}$mer delay on timing residuals are simulated in this work. The
results show that the residual due to the effect can be identified by the
oscillation envelopes of the residuals. It is also shown that the amplitude of
the residual due to the effect is usually relatively small, however, it may
probably be observable for pulsars distributing in the vicinity of the core of
a nearby GC.

in massive systems which are in the state of merging. The radio emission can
usually be classified as relic or halo emission, which are believed to be
related to merger shocks or volume-filling turbulence, respectively. Recent
observations have revealed radio bridges for some pairs of very closeby galaxy
clusters. The mechanisms that may allow to explain the high specific density of
relativistic electrons, necessary to explain the radio luminosity of these
bridge regions, are poorly explored. We analyse the galaxy cluster Abell 1430
with LoTSS data in detail and complement it with recent JVLA L-band
observations, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and SDSS data. Moreover, we compare our
results to clusters extracted from the ""The Three Hundred Project"" cosmological
simulation. We find that Abell 1430 consists of two components, namely A1430-A
and A1430-B. We speculate that the two components undergo an off-axis merger.
The more massive component shows diffuse radio emission which can be classified
as radio halo showing a low radio power given the mass of the cluster. Most
interestingly, there is extended diffuse radio emission, dubbed as the
`Pillow', which is apparently related to A1430-B and thus related to low
density intracluster or intergalactic medium. To date, a only few examples for
emission originating from such regions are known. These discoveries are crucial
to constrain possible acceleration mechanisms, which may allow to explain the
presence of relativistic electrons in these regions. Our results indicate a
spectral index of $\alpha_{144\,\text{MHz}}^{1.5\,\text{GHz}}=-1.4\pm0.5$ for
the Pillow. If future observations confirm a slope as flat as the central value
of -1.4 or even flatter, this would pose a severe challenge for the electron
acceleration scenarios.

and demises in each region and to predict their final numbers, as well as the
dates of maximum daily occurrences and the local stabilization date. The model
parameters are calibrated using a computational methodology for numerical
optimization. Trend analyses are run, allowing to assess the effects of public

equation $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 3xyz$. Already in 1880, Markov showed that all
these solutions could be generated along a binary tree. So it became quite
usual (and useful) to index the Markov numbers by the rationals between 0 and 1
which stand at the same place in the Stern-Brocot binary tree. The Frobenius
conjecture claims that each Markov number appears at most once in the tree.
  In particular, if the conjecture is true, the order of Markov numbers would
establish a new strict order on the rationals. Aigner suggested three
conjectures to better understand this order. The first one has already been
solved for a few months. We prove that the other two conjectures are also true.
  Along the way, we generalize Markov numbers to any couple (p,q) of
nonnegative integers (not only when they are relatively primes) and conjecture
that the unicity is still true as soon as $p \leq q$. Finally, we show that the
three conjectures are in fact true for this superset.

puzzling and many are now known to be surrounded by an extensive halo of stars.
Distinctive core-halo structure is characteristic of dark matter as a Bose
Einstein condensate, $\psi$DM, with a dense, soliton core predicted in every
galaxy, representing the ground state, surrounded by a large, tenuous halo of
excited density waves. A marked density transition is predicted between the
core and the halo set by the de Broglie wavelength, as the soliton core is a
prominent standing wave that is denser by over an order of magnitude than the
surrounding halo. Here we identify this predicted behavior in the stellar
profiles of the well known ""isolated"" dwarfs that lie outside the Milky Way,
each with a clear density transition at $\simeq 1.0~{\rm kpc}$, implying a very
light boson, $m_{\psi} \simeq 10^{-22}$eV. The classical dwarf galaxies
orbiting within the Milky Way also show this predicted core-halo structure but
with larger density transitions of over two orders of magnitude, that we show
implies tidal stripping of dwarf galaxies by the Milky way, as the tenuous halo
is more easily stripped than the stable soliton core. We conclude that dark
matter as a light boson explains the observed family of classical dwarf
profiles with tidal stripping included, in contrast to the standard heavy
particle interpretation where low mass galaxies should be concentrated and
core-less, quite unlike the core-halo structure observed.

memory accrues and stores semantic information for the probabilistic inference

is grown from scratch and gradually consolidated by absorbing information from
tasks it experiences. By doing so, it is able to accumulate long-term, general
knowledge that enables it to learn new concepts of objects. We formulate memory
recall as the variational inference of a latent memory variable from addressed
contents, which offers a principled way to adapt the knowledge to individual
tasks. Our variational semantic memory, as a new long-term memory module,
confers principled recall and update mechanisms that enable semantic
information to be efficiently accrued and adapted for few-shot learning.
Experiments demonstrate that the probabilistic modelling of prototypes achieves
a more informative representation of object classes compared to deterministic
vectors. The consistent new state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks
shows the benefit of variational semantic memory in boosting few-shot

orbitals in $\alpha$-Sr$_2$CrO$_4$, with the $3d^2$ electronic configuration
for the Cr$^{4+}$ oxidation state, opens up the possibility of orbital ordering
in this material. Using real-space Hartree-Fock for multi-orbital systems, we
constructed the ground-state phase diagram for the two-dimensional compound
$\alpha$-Sr$_2$CrO$_4$. We found stable ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic,
antiferro-orbital, and staggered orbital stripe ordering in robust regions of
the phase diagram. Furthermore, using the density matrix renormalization group
method for two-leg ladders with the realistic hopping parameters of
$\alpha$-Sr$_2$CrO$_4$, we explore magnetic and orbital ordering for
experimentally relevant interaction parameters. Again, we find a clear
signature of antiferromagnetic spin ordering along with antiferro-orbital
ordering at moderate to large Hubbard interaction strength. We also explore the
orbital-resolved density of states with Lanczos, predicting insulating behavior
for the compound $\alpha$-Sr$_2$CrO$_4$, in agreement with experiments.
Finally, an intuitive understanding of the results is provided based on a
hierarchy between orbitals, with $d_{xy}$ driving the spin order, while
electronic repulsion and the effective one dimensionality of the movement

data. It decomposes a provenance graph into tree-patterns rooted at a given
node and considers the labels of edges and nodes up to a certain distance from
the root. We employ provenance kernels to classify provenance graphs from three
application domains. Our evaluation shows that they perform well in terms of
classification accuracy and yield competitive results when compared against
existing graph kernel methods and the provenance network analytics method while
more efficient in computing time. Moreover, the provenance types used by
provenance kernels also help improve the explainability of predictive models
built on them.

research in many domains of science and engineering. In this context, Monte
Carlo methods have been widely used as powerful tools for numerical inference
and optimization. They require the choice of a suitable proposal density that
is crucial for their performance. For this reason, several adaptive importance
sampling (AIS) schemes have been proposed in the literature. We here present an
AIS framework called Regression-based Adaptive Deep Importance Sampling
(RADIS). In RADIS, the key idea is the adaptive construction via regression of
a non-parametric proposal density (i.e., an emulator), which mimics the
posterior distribution and hence minimizes the mismatch between proposal and
target densities. RADIS is based on a deep architecture of two (or more) nested
IS schemes, in order to draw samples from the constructed emulator. The
algorithm is highly efficient since employs the posterior approximation as
proposal density, which can be improved adding more support points. As a
consequence, RADIS asymptotically converges to an exact sampler under mild
conditions. Additionally, the emulator produced by RADIS can be in turn used as
a cheap surrogate model for further studies. We introduce two specific RADIS
implementations that use Gaussian Processes (GPs) and Nearest Neighbors (NN)
for constructing the emulator. Several numerical experiments and comparisons
show the benefits of the proposed schemes. A real-world application in remote
sensing model inversion and emulation confirms the validity of the approach.

functional molecules on inorganic surfaces. To obtain specific molecular
arrangements, a common strategy is to equip molecules with functional groups.
However, focusing on the functional groups alone does not provide a
comprehensive picture. Especially at interfaces, processes that govern
self-ordering are complex and involve various physical and chemical effects,
often leading to structures that defy chemical intuition, as we showcase here
on the example of a homologous series of quinones on Ag(111). From chemical
intuition one could expect that such quinones, which all bear the same
functionalization, form similar motifs. In salient contrast, our joint
theoretical and experimental study shows that profoundly different structures
are formed. Using a machine-learning-based structure search algorithm, we find
that this is due to a shift of the balance of three antagonizing driving
forces: adsorbate-substrate interactions governing adsorption sites,
adsorbate-adsorbate interactions favoring close packing, and steric hindrance
inhibiting certain otherwise energetically beneficial molecular arrangements.
The theoretical structures show excellent agreement with our experimental
characterizations of the organic/inorganic interfaces, both for the unit cell
sizes and the orientations of the molecules within. With a detailed examination
of all driving forces, we are further able to devise a design principle for
self-assembly of functionalized molecules. The non-intuitive interplay of
similarly strong interaction mechanisms will continue to be a challenging
aspect for the design of functional interfaces. Our agreement between theory
and experiment combined with the new physical insights indicates that these
methods have now reached the necessary accuracy to do so.

recently, the concept of cloud-native application has been proposed and
represents an invaluable step toward helping organizations develop software
faster and update it more frequently to achieve dramatic business outcomes.
Cloud-native is an approach to build and run applications that exploit the
cloud computing delivery model's advantages. It is more about how applications
are created and deployed than where. The container-based virtualization
technology, such as Docker and Kubernetes, serves as the foundation for
cloud-native applications. This paper investigates the performance of two
popular computational-intensive applications, big data, and deep learning, in a
cloud-native environment. We analyze the system overhead and resource usage for
these applications. Through extensive experiments, we show that the completion
time reduces by up to 79.4% by changing the default setting and increases by up
to 96.7% due to different resource management schemes on two platforms.
Additionally, the resource release is delayed by up to 116.7% across different
systems. Our work can guide developers, administrators, and researchers to
better design and deploy their applications by selecting and configuring a

has previously been found between the multiplicity of a planetary system and
the orbital eccentricities of its components, for systems with multiplicities
above two. In this study we investigate the correlation for an expanded data
sample, by focusing on planetary systems as units (unlike previous studies that
have focused on individual planets). Our full data sample contains 1171
exoplanets, in 895 systems, and the correlation between eccentricity and
multiplicity is found to follow a clear power law for all multiplicities above
one. We discuss the correlation for several individual subsamples, and find
that all samples consistently follow the same basic trend regardless of e.g.
planet types and detection methods. We find that the eccentricities of the
Solar System fit the general trend and suggest that the Solar System might not
show uncommonly low eccentricities (as often speculated) but rather uncommonly
many planets compared to a ""standard"" planetary system. The only outlier from
the power law correlation is, consistently in all the samples, the one-planet
systems. It has previously been suggested that this may be due to additional
unseen exoplanets in the observed one-planet systems. Based on this assumption
and the power law correlation, we estimate that the probability of a system
having 8 planets or more is of the order of 1%, in good agreement with recent
predictions from analyses based on independent arguments.

states in an intermediate complexity climate model and analyze their interplay.
First, drawing from the theory of quasipotentials, and viewing the state space
as an energy landscape with valleys and mountain ridges, we infer the relative
likelihood of the identified multistable climate states, and investigate the
most likely transition trajectories as well as the expected transition times
between them. Second, harnessing techniques from data science, specifically
manifold learning, we characterize the data landscape of the simulation output
to find climate states and basin boundaries within a fully agnostic and
unsupervised framework. Both approaches show remarkable agreement, and reveal,
apart from the well known warm and snowball earth states, a third intermediate
stable state in one of the two climate models we consider. The combination of
our approaches allows to identify how the negative feedback of ocean heat
transport and entropy production via the hydrological cycle drastically change
the topography of the dynamical landscape of Earth's climate.

compression algorithms are necessary. Here, a Bayesian data compression (BDC)
algorithm that adapts to the specific measurement situation is derived in the
context of signal reconstruction. BDC compresses a data set under conservation
of its posterior structure with minimal information loss given the prior
knowledge on the signal, the quantity of interest. Its basic form is valid for
Gaussian priors and likelihoods. For constant noise standard deviation, basic
BDC becomes equivalent to a Bayesian analog of principal component analysis.
Using Metric Gaussian Variational Inference, BDC generalizes to non-linear
settings. In its current form, BDC requires the storage of effective instrument
response functions for the compressed data and corresponding noise encoding the
posterior covariance structure. Their memory demand counteract the compression
gain. In order to improve this, sparsity of the compressed responses can be
obtained by separating the data into patches and compressing them separately.
The applicability of BDC is demonstrated by applying it to synthetic data and
radio astronomical data. Still the algorithm needs further improvement as the
computation time of the compression and subsequent inference exceeds the time
of the inference with the original data.

Parker Solar Probe (PSP) have revealed the presence of patches of switchbacks
on the scale of hours to days, separated by 'quieter' radial fields. We aim to
further diagnose the origin of these patches using measurements of proton
temperature anisotropy that can illuminate possible links to formation
processes in the solar corona. We fitted 3D bi-Maxwellian functions to the core
of proton velocity distributions measured by the SPAN-Ai instrument onboard PSP
to obtain the proton parallel, $T_{p,\|}$, and perpendicular, $T_{p,\perp}$,
temperature. We show that the presence of patches is highlighted by a
transverse deflection in the flow and magnetic field away from the radial
direction. These deflections are correlated with enhancements in $T_{p,\|}$,
while $T_{p,\perp}$ remains relatively constant. Patches sometimes exhibit
small proton and electron density enhancements. We interpret that patches are
not simply a group of switchbacks, but rather switchbacks are embedded within a
larger-scale structure identified by enhanced $T_{p,\|}$ that is distinct from
the surrounding solar wind. We suggest that these observations are consistent
with formation by reconnection-associated mechanisms in the corona.

However, when agents are self-interested, the gains from team formation must be
allocated appropriately to incentivize agreement. Various approaches for

particular negotiation protocols. More general methods usually require human

evaluate our approach on both non-spatial and spatially extended team-formation

this system is thought to achieve a good balance between the flexibility of

vocabularies from the general domain is not always suitable, especially when
building models for specialized domains (e.g., the medical domain). Moreover,
adopting a wordpiece tokenization shifts the focus from the word level to the

a crucial role. In the case of a discrete symmetry group, the corrections decay
algebraically with system size, with exponents related to the operators'

the computation of twisted overlaps.

spreading: endogenous social self-distancing and exogenous imposed quarantine.
We use the framework of adaptive networks, moment-closure, and ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) to introduce several novel models based upon
susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) dynamics. First, we compare
computationally expensive, adaptive network simulations with their
corresponding computationally highly efficient ODE equivalents and find
excellent agreement. Second, we discover that there exists a relatively simple
critical curve in parameter space for the epidemic threshold, which strongly
suggests that there is a mutual compensation effect between the two mitigation
strategies: as long as social distancing and quarantine measures are both
sufficiently strong, large outbreaks are prevented. Third, we study the total
number of infected and the maximum peak during large outbreaks using a
combination of analytical estimates and numerical simulations. Also for large
outbreaks we find a similar compensation effect as for the epidemic threshold.
This suggests that if there is little incentive for social distancing within a
population, drastic quarantining is required, and vice versa. Both pure
scenarios are unrealistic in practice. Our models show that only a combination
of measures is likely to succeed to control epidemic spreading. Fourth, we
analytically compute an upper bound for the total number of infected on
adaptive networks, using integral estimates in combination with the
moment-closure approximation on the level of an observable. This is a
methodological innovation. Our method allows us to elegantly and quickly check
and cross-validate various conjectures about the relevance of different network
control measures.

  arXiv:1701.07879",,,,"cs.LG cs.NE q-bio.NC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  There is increasing realization in neuroscience that information is
represented in the brain, e.g., neocortex, hippocampus, in the form sparse
distributed codes (SDCs), a kind of cell assembly. Two essential questions are:
a) how are such codes formed on the basis of single trials, and how is
similarity preserved during learning, i.e., how do more similar inputs get
mapped to more similar SDCs. I describe a novel Modular Sparse Distributed Code
(MSDC) that provides simple, neurally plausible answers to both questions. An
MSDC coding field (CF) consists of Q WTA competitive modules (CMs), each
comprised of K binary units (analogs of principal cells). The modular nature of
the CF makes possible a single-trial, unsupervised learning algorithm that
approximately preserves similarity and crucially, runs in fixed time, i.e., the
number of steps needed to store an item remains constant as the number of
stored items grows. Further, once items are stored as MSDCs in superposition
and such that their intersection structure reflects input similarity, both
fixed time best-match retrieval and fixed time belief update (updating the
probabilities of all stored items) also become possible. The algorithm's core
principle is simply to add noise into the process of choosing a code, i.e.,
choosing a winner in each CM, which is proportional to the novelty of the
input. This causes the expected intersection of the code for an input, X, with
the code of each previously stored input, Y, to be proportional to the
similarity of X and Y. Results demonstrating these capabilities for spatial
patterns are given in the appendix.

where the potential energy wells are connected by index-1 saddles, the motion
between potential wells is governed by the invariant manifolds of a periodic
orbit around the saddle. In two degree of freedom systems, such invariant
manifolds appear as cylindrical conduits which are referred to as transition
tubes. In this study, we apply the concept of invariant manifolds to study the
transition between potential wells in not only conservative systems, but more
realistic dissipative systems, by solving respective proper boundary-value
problems. The example system considered is a two mode model of the snap-through
buckling of a shallow arch. We define the transition region, $\mathcal{T}_h$,
as a set of initial conditions of a given initial Hamiltonian energy $h$ with
which the trajectories can escape from one potential well to another, which in
the example system corresponds to snap-through buckling of a structure. The
numerical results reveal that in the conservative system the boundary of the
transition region, $\partial \mathcal{T}_h$, is a cylinder, while in the
dissipative system, $\partial \mathcal{T}_h$ is an ellipsoid. The algorithms
developed in the current research from the perspective of invariant manifold
provides a robust theoretical-computational framework to study escape and

this generalizes the model underpinning the Elo algorithm, where the MOV
variable is discretized into three categories (win/loss/draw). Second, with the
formal probabilistic model at hand, the optimization required by the maximum

avoid the significant accuracy degradation due to its numerical approximation
and lower redundancy. In this paper, a novel robustness-aware 2-bit
quantization scheme is proposed for NN base on binary NN and generative
adversarial network(GAN), witch improves the performance by enriching the
information of binary NN, efficiently extract the structural information and
considering the robustness of the quantized NN. Specifically, using shift
addition operation to replace the multiply-accumulate in the quantization
process witch can effectively speed the NN. Meanwhile, a structural loss
between the original NN and quantized NN is proposed to such that the
structural information of data is preserved after quantization. The structural
information learned from NN not only plays an important role in improving the
performance but also allows for further fine tuning of the quantization network
by applying the Lipschitz constraint to the structural loss. In addition, we
also for the first time take the robustness of the quantized NN into

introducing an extraneous term of spectral norm. The experiments are conducted
on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets with popular NN( such as MoblieNetV2,

significant forecasting results. There are generally, four factors that
determine the performance of the forecasting method (1) number of intervals
(NOIs) and length of intervals to partition universe of discourse (UOD) (2)
fuzzification rules or feature representation of crisp time series (3) method
of establishing fuzzy logic rule (FLRs) between input and target values (4)
defuzzification rule to get crisp forecasted value. Considering the first two
factors to improve the forecasting accuracy, we proposed a novel non-stochastic
method fuzzy time series forecasting in which interval index number and
membership value are used as input features to predict future value. We
suggested a simple rounding-off range and suitable step size method to find the
optimal number of intervals (NOIs) and used fuzzy c-means clustering process to
divide UOD into intervals of unequal length. We implement support vector
machine (SVM) to establish FLRs. To test our proposed method we conduct a
simulated study on five widely used real time series and compare the
performance with some recently developed models. We also examine the
performance of the proposed model by using multi-layer perceptron (MLP) instead
of SVM. Two performance measures RSME and SMAPE are used for performance
analysis and observed better forecasting accuracy by the proposed model.

consideration of core overshooting and stellar wind physics with an improved
scaling of mass loss with iron (Fe) contents characteristic for the host galaxy

the past decade, the availability of big data in the healthcare domain did open
a new era for clinical decision support. Machine learning technologies are now
widely used in the clinical domain, nevertheless, mostly as a tool for disease
prediction. A tool that not only predicts future states, but also enables

state changes based on actions planned in clinical pathways. Weighted state
transition logic extends linear logic by taking weights -- numerical values
indicating the quality of an action or an entire clinical pathway -- into
account. It allows us to predict the future states of a patient and it enables
adaptive clinical pathway management based on these predictions. We provide an
implementation of weighted state transition logic using semantic web
technologies, which makes it easy to integrate semantic data and rules as
background knowledge. Executed by a semantic reasoner, it is possible to
generate a clinical pathway towards a target state, as well as to detect
potential conflicts in the future when multiple pathways are coexisting. The
transitions from the current state to the predicted future state are traceable,
which builds trust from human users on the generated pathway.

successes. Models such as Linear Discriminant Analysis or Artificial Neural
Network employ discriminative classification techniques. They lack explicit
provision to include prior expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose another
