(CF) models. The intuition is to exploit neighbors with similar preferences for
bridging unseen user-item pairs and alleviating data sparseness. Many existing
works propose neural attention networks to aggregate neighbors and place higher
weights on specific subsets of users for recommendation. However, the
neighborhood information is not necessarily always informative, and the noises
in the neighborhood can negatively affect the model performance. To address
this issue, we propose a novel neighborhood-based recommender, where a hybrid
gated network is designed to automatically separate similar neighbors from
dissimilar (noisy) ones, and aggregate those similar neighbors to comprise
neighborhood representations. The confidence in the neighborhood is also
addressed by putting higher weights on the neighborhood representations if we
are confident with the neighborhood information, and vice versa. In addition, a
user-neighbor component is proposed to explicitly regularize user-neighbor
proximity in the latent space. These two components are combined into a unified
model to complement each other for the recommendation task. Extensive
experiments on three publicly available datasets show that the proposed model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art neighborhood-based recommenders. We
also study different variants of the proposed model to justify the underlying
intuition of the proposed hybrid gated network and user-neighbor modeling
components.

  transport in core-collapse supernovae","Invited review article for Living Reviews in Computational
  Astrophysics. In press",,,,"astro-ph.HE gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The proposal that core collapse supernovae are neutrino driven is still the
subject of active investigation more than fifty years after the seminal paper
by Colgate and White. The modern version of this paradigm, which we owe to
Wilson, proposes that the supernova shock wave is powered by neutrino heating,
mediated by the absorption of electron-flavor neutrinos and antineutrinos
emanating from the proto-neutron star surface, or neutrinosphere. Neutrino weak
interactions with the stellar core fluid, the theory of which is still
evolving, are flavor and energy dependent. The associated neutrino mean free
paths extend over many orders of magnitude and are never always small relative
to the stellar core radius. Thus, neutrinos are never always fluid like.
Instead, a kinetic description of them in terms of distribution functions that
determine the number density of neutrinos in the six-dimensional phase space of
position, direction, and energy, for both neutrinos and antineutrinos of each
flavor, or in terms of angular moments of these neutrino distributions that
instead provide neutrino number densities in the four-dimensional phase-space
subspace of position and energy, is needed. In turn, the computational
challenge is twofold: (i) to map the kinetic equations governing the evolution
of these distributions or moments onto discrete representations that are
stable, accurate, and, perhaps most important, respect physical laws such as
conservation of lepton number and energy and the Fermi--Dirac nature of
neutrinos and (ii) to develop efficient, supercomputer-architecture-aware
solution methods for the resultant nonlinear algebraic equations. In this
review, we present the current state of the art in attempts to meet this
challenge.

microstructure and be subjected to a remote field. At the microscale,
finite-strain micromechanical analysis based on the homogenization technique
for the (intact) composite is employed for the prediction of the effective
deformation. At the macroscale, a procedure, based on the representative cell
method and the associated higher-order theory, is developed for the
determination of the elastic field in the damaged composite. The periodic
composite is discretized into identical cells and then reduced to the problem
of a single cell by application of the discrete Fourier transform. The
resulting governing equations, interfacial and boundary conditions in the
Fourier transform domain, are solved by employing the higher-order theory in
conjunction with an iterative procedure to treat the effects of damage and
material nonlinearity. The initial conditions for the iterative solution are
obtained using the weakly-nonlinear material limit and a natural fixed-point
iteration. A locally-convergent low-memory Quasi-Newton solver is then
employed. A new algorithm for the implementation of the solver is proposed,
which allows storing in the memory directly the vector-function
history-sequence, which may be advantageous for convergence-control based on
specific components of the objective vector-function. The strong-form Fourier
transform-based approach employed here, in conjunction with the new solver,
enables to extend the application of the method to nonlinear materials and may
have computational efficiency comparable or possibly advantageous to that of

the swap test on qubits to calculate the values of quantum-based loss

94.98% reduction on the parameter set when compared to classical GANs. With the

turbulence in a layer where the fundamental processes of transport vary rapidly
and a strongly superadiabatic region lies very closely to a subadiabatic layer.
Our tools for probing the turbulence are high-resolution spectropolarimetric
observations such as have recently been obtained with the two sunrise missions,
and numerical simulations. Our aim is to study photospheric turbulence with the
help of Fourier power spectra that we compute from observations and
simulations. We also attempt to explain some properties of the photospheric
overshooting flow with the help of its governing equations and simulations. We
find that quiet-Sun observations and smeared simulations exhibit a power-law
behavior in the subgranular range of their Doppler velocity power spectra with
an index of$~\approx -2$. The unsmeared simulations exhibit a power-law index
of$~\approx -2.25$. The smearing considerably reduces the extent of the
power-law-like portion of the spectra. Therefore, the limited spatial
resolution in some observations might eventually result in larger uncertainties
in the estimation of the power-law indices.
  The simulated vertical velocity power spectra as a function of height show a
rapid change in the power-law index from the solar surface to $300$~km above
it. A scale-dependent transport of the vertical momentum occurs. At smaller
scales, the vertical momentum is more efficiently transported sideways than at
larger scales. This results in less vertical velocity power transported upward
at small scales than at larger scales and produces a progressively steeper
vertical velocity power law below $180$ km. Above this height, the gravity work
progressively gains importance at all scales, making the atmosphere
progressively more hydrostatic and resulting in a gradually less steep power
law.

especially in medical imaging, where reliance on inference without taking into
account uncertainty could lead to misdiagnosis. Recently, the probabilistic
Variational AutoEncoder (VAE) has become a popular model for anomaly detection
in applications such as lesion detection in medical images. The VAE is a
generative graphical model that is used to learn the data distribution from
samples and then generate new samples from this distribution. By training on
normal samples, the VAE can be used to detect inputs that deviate from this
learned distribution. The VAE models the output as a conditionally independent
Gaussian characterized by means and variances for each output dimension. VAEs
can therefore use reconstruction probability instead of reconstruction error
for anomaly detection. Unfortunately, joint optimization of both mean and
variance in the VAE leads to the well-known problem of shrinkage or
underestimation of variance. We describe an alternative approach that avoids
this variance shrinkage problem by using quantile regression. Using estimated
quantiles to compute mean and variance under the Gaussian assumption, we
compute reconstruction probability as a principled approach to outlier or
anomaly detection. Results on simulated and Fashion MNIST data demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach. We also show how our approach can be used for
principled heterogeneous thresholding for lesion detection in brain images.

groups acting on the Berkovich projective line, highlighting how geometry and
group theory come together to prove that the quotient by the action of a
Schottky group is an analytic Mumford curve. Finally, we present an analytic
proof of Schottky uniformization, showing that any analytic Mumford curves can
be described as a quotient of this kind. The guiding principle of our

singularities which could appear in the theory will generically affect
predictability and so one will be forced to analyse whether there is a way to
regularise them. For these possible regularisations, the presence and behaviour

equation introduced by Karl Heun in 1889. The Heun functions generalize many
known special functions and appear in many fields of modern physics. Evaluation
of the functions was described in [1]. It is based on local power series
solutions near the origin, derived by the Frobenius method, and analytic
continuation to the whole complex plane with branch cuts. However, exceptional
cases can occur at integer values of an exponent-related parameter $\gamma$ of
the equation, when one of the two local solutions should include a logarithmic

approaches the integer values. Here we suggest a method of regularization and
redefine the Heun functions in some vicinities of the integer values of
$\gamma$, where the new functions depend smoothly on the parameter.

knowledge and hyper-rational models of individual behavior. However, decades of
work in behavioral economics have questioned the validity of both foundations.
Meanwhile, computational neuroscience has contributed a modernized 'dual
process' account of decision-making where model-free (MF) reinforcement
learning trades off with model-based (MB) reinforcement learning. The former
captures habitual and procedural learning while the latter captures choices
taken via explicit planning and deduction. Some conventions (e.g. international
treaties) are likely supported by cognition that resonates with the game
theoretic and MB accounts. However, convention formation may also occur via MF
mechanisms like habit learning; though this possibility has been understudied.
Here, we demonstrate that complex, large-scale conventions can emerge from MF
learning mechanisms. This suggests that some conventions may be supported by
habit-like cognition rather than explicit reasoning. We apply MF multi-agent
reinforcement learning to a temporo-spatially extended game with incomplete
information. In this game, large parts of the state space are reachable only by
collective action. However, heterogeneity of tastes makes such coordinated
action difficult: multiple equilibria are desirable for all players, but
subgroups prefer a particular equilibrium over all others. This creates a
coordination problem that can be solved by establishing a convention. We
investigate start-up and free rider subproblems as well as the effects of group
size, intensity of intrinsic preference, and salience on the emergence dynamics
of coordination conventions. Results of our simulations show agents establish
and switch between conventions, even working against their own preferred
outcome when doing so is necessary for effective coordination.

When coupled with generation maintenance, the joint optimization problem poses
significant computational challenges due to coupling constraints linking
maintenance and UC decisions. Obviously, these challenges grow with the size of
the network. With the introduction of sensors for monitoring generator health
and condition-based maintenance(CBM), these challenges have been magnified.
ADMM-based decentralized methods have shown promise in solving large-scale UC
problems, especially in vertically integrated power systems. However, in their
current form, these methods fail to deliver similar computational performance
and scalability when considering the joint UC and CBM problem.
  This paper provides a novel decentralized optimization framework for solving
large-scale, joint UC and CBM problems. Our approach relies on the novel use of
the subgradient method to temporally decouple various subproblems of the
ADMM-based formulation of the joint problem along the maintenance horizon. By
effectively utilizing multithreading, our decentralized subgradient approach
delivers superior computational performance and eliminates the need to move
sensor data thereby alleviating privacy and security concerns. Using
experiments on large scale test cases, we show that our framework can provide a
speedup of upto 50x as compared to various state of the art benchmarks without
compromising on solution quality.

the Poisson structure on fibres is locally trivial (Poisson fibre bundles and
coupling Poisson structures), or at the very least which admit a compatible

  This prompted us to study here general Poisson submersions whose fibres
inherit Poisson structures. It turns out that the induced Poisson structure on
fibres is always of an especially well-behaved nature -- what we call coregular
submanifolds -- and that such Poisson submersions enjoy nice functorial

construction absent even local triviality of the induced foliations, and we

labels depends on the annotator, some of the labels might be wrong, which
results in degraded recognition performance. In this paper, we address the
problems of i) how a system can identify which of the queried labels are wrong
and ii) how a multi-class active learning system can be adapted to minimize the
negative impact of label noise. Towards solving the problems, we propose a
noisy label filtering based learning approach where the inter-relationship
(context) that is quite common in natural data is utilized to detect the wrong
labels. We construct a graphical representation of the unlabeled data to encode
these relationships and obtain new beliefs on the graph when noisy labels are
available. Comparing the new beliefs with the prior relational information, we
generate a dissimilarity score to detect the incorrect labels and update the
recognition model with correct labels which result in better recognition
performance. This is demonstrated in three different applications: scene
classification, activity classification, and document classification.

example, when a car is about to turn around a corner, the road which is
currently occluded by buildings may turn out to be either free to drive, or
occupied by people, other vehicles or roadworks. When a deterministic model
confronts such situation, its best guess is to forecast the most likely
outcome. However, this is not acceptable since it defeats the purpose of
forecasting to improve security. It also throws away valuable training data,
since a deterministic model is unable to learn any deviation from the norm. We
address this problem by providing more freedom to the model through allowing it
to forecast different futures. We propose to formulate multimodal forecasting
as sampling of a multimodal generative model conditioned on the observed
frames. Experiments on the Cityscapes dataset reveal that our multimodal model

infinitely large environments. While this idealization facilitates theoretical
treatments, real physical systems are always finite and their interaction range
is limited. These constraints have consequences for important tasks such as
cooling, not directly captured by the second law of thermodynamics. Here, we
study catalytic transformations that cannot be achieved when a system
exclusively interacts with a finite environment. Our core result consists of
constructive conditions for these transformations, which include the
corresponding global unitary operation and the explicit states of all the
systems involved. From this result we present various findings regarding the
use of catalysts for cooling. First, we show that catalytic cooling is always
possible if the dimension of the catalyst is sufficiently large. In particular,
the cooling of a qubit using a hot qubit can be maximized with a catalyst as
small as a three-level system. We also identify catalytic enhancements for
tasks whose implementation is possible without a catalyst. For example, we find
that in a multiqubit setup catalytic cooling based on a three-body interaction
outperforms standard (non-catalytic) cooling using higher order interactions.
Another advantage is illustrated in a thermometry scenario, where a qubit is
employed to probe the temperature of the environment. In this case, we show
that a catalyst allows to surpass the optimal temperature estimation attained
only with the probe.

  (OOPSLA 2020)",,,,"cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Pressed by the difficulty of writing asynchronous, event-driven code,
mainstream languages have recently been building in support for a variety of
advanced control-flow features. Meanwhile, experimental language designs have
suggested effect handlers as a unifying solution to programmer-defined control
effects, subsuming exceptions, generators, and async--await. Despite these
trends, complex control flow---in particular, control flow exhibiting a
bidirectional pattern---remains challenging to manage.
  We introduce bidirectional algebraic effects, a new programming abstraction
that supports bidirectional control transfer in a more natural way. Handlers of
bidirectional effects can raise further effects to transfer control back to the
site where the initiating effect was raised, and can use themselves to handle
their own effects. We present applications of this expressive power, which
falls out naturally as we push toward the unification of effectful programming
with object-oriented programming. We pin down the mechanism and the unification
formally using a core language that generalizes to effect operations and effect
handlers.
  The usual propagation semantics of control effects such as exceptions
conflicts with modular reasoning in the presence of effect polymorphism---it
breaks parametricity. Bidirectionality exacerbates the problem. Hence, we set
out to show the core language, which builds on the existing tunneling semantics
for algebraic effects, is not only type-safe (no effects go unhandled), but
also abstraction-safe (no effects are accidentally handled). We devise a
step-indexed logical-relations model, and construct its parametricity and
soundness proofs. These core results are fully mechanized in Coq. Preliminary
experiments show that as a first-class language feature, bidirectional handlers
can be implemented efficiently.

this paper, we combine SEIR and RNN on a graph structure to develop a hybrid

(local temporal infection trend) and edge feature (geographic neighbor effect).
For node feature, we derive a discrete recursion (called I-equation) from SEIR
so that gradient descend method applies readily to its optimization. For edge
feature, we design an RNN model to capture the neighboring effect and
regularize the landscape of loss function so that local minima are effective

models, an attacker adds a small trigger to a subset of the training data, such
that the presence of this trigger at test time causes the classifier to always
predict some target class. It is often implicitly assumed that the poisoned
classifier is vulnerable exclusively to the adversary who possesses the
trigger. In this paper, we show empirically that this view of backdoored
classifiers is incorrect. We describe a new threat model for poisoned
classifier, where one without knowledge of the original trigger, would want to
control the poisoned classifier. Under this threat model, we propose a
test-time, human-in-the-loop attack method to generate multiple effective
alternative triggers without access to the initial backdoor and the training
data. We construct these alternative triggers by first generating adversarial
examples for a smoothed version of the classifier, created with a procedure
called Denoised Smoothing, and then extracting colors or cropped portions of
smoothed adversarial images with human interaction. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our attack through extensive experiments on high-resolution

modeling trigger distributions and find that our method are more scalable and
efficient in generating effective triggers. Last, we include a user study which
demonstrates that our method allows users to easily determine the existence of
such backdoors in existing poisoned classifiers. Thus, we argue that there is
no such thing as a secret backdoor in poisoned classifiers: poisoning a
classifier invites attacks not just by the party that possesses the trigger,

The motion is a continuous-time, constant-speed interpolation of the simple
symmetric random walk on the marked points. In this paper we study the large
fluctuations of the continuous-time process and the resulting transport
properties of the model, both annealed and quenched, confirming and extending
previous work by physicists that pertain to the annealed framework.
Specifically, focusing on the particle displacement, and under the assumption
that the tail distribution of the interdistances between scatterers is

quenched moments, showing that the asymptotic diffusive regime conditional on a
typical arrangement of the scatterers is normal diffusion, and not
superdiffusion. Although the L\'evy-Lorentz gas seems to be accepted as a model
for anomalous diffusion, our findings suggest that superdiffusion is a
transient behavior which develops into normal diffusion on long timescales, and
raise a new question about how the transition from the quenched normal

obtains multi-scale partial representations using a state-of-the-art deep

co-occurrences of the patterns among the partial features in forward and
backward directions using Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (BGRU). Finally,
a capsule network is adopted to learn deeper part-whole relationships and
assigns more weights to the more relevant features while ignoring the spurious
dimensions. That way, we obtain final features that are more robust to both
viewing and appearance changes. The performance of our method has been
extensively tested on two gait recognition datasets, CASIA-B and OU-MVLP, using
four challenging test protocols. The results of our method have been compared

However, there is a gap between the practical demand and the achievable

With many efforts devoted to designing more sophisticated L2O models, we argue
for another orthogonal, under-explored theme: the training techniques for those
L2O models. We show that even the simplest L2O model could have been trained
much better. We first present a progressive training scheme to gradually
increase the optimizer unroll length, to mitigate a well-known L2O dilemma of
truncation bias (shorter unrolling) versus gradient explosion (longer
unrolling). We further leverage off-policy imitation learning to guide the L2O
learning, by taking reference to the behavior of analytical optimizers. Our
improved training techniques are plugged into a variety of state-of-the-art L2O
models, and immediately boost their performance, without making any change to

The outflowing gas is characterized by two distinct thermal phases, cool

most energy and newly-injected metals carried by the hot phase. Both components
have a broad distribution of outflow velocity, and especially for cool gas this

features acquired from their body movement during walking. Despite the recent
advances in gait recognition with deep learning, variations in data acquisition
and appearance, namely camera angles, subject pose, occlusions, and clothing,
are challenging factors that need to be considered for achieving accurate gait
recognition systems. In this paper, we propose a network that first learns to
extract gait convolutional energy maps (GCEM) from frame-level convolutional
features. It then adopts a bidirectional recurrent neural network to learn from
split bins of the GCEM, thus exploiting the relations between learned partial
spatiotemporal representations. We then use an attention mechanism to
selectively focus on important recurrently learned partial representations as
identity information in different scenarios may lie in different GCEM bins. Our
proposed model has been extensively tested on two large-scale CASIA-B and
OU-MVLP gait datasets using four different test protocols and has been compared
to a number of state-of-the-art and baseline solutions. Additionally, a
comprehensive experiment has been performed to study the robustness of our
model in the presence of six different synthesized occlusions. The experimental
results show the superiority of our proposed method, outperforming the
state-of-the-art, especially in scenarios where different clothing and carrying

multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), while the non-orthogonal multiple

efficiency of the wireless network. The optimization problem of joint
three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design and power allocation is formulated for
maximizing the throughput. Since ground mobile users are considered as roaming
continuously, the UAVs need to be re-deployed timely based on the movement of
users. In an effort to solve this pertinent dynamic problem, a K-means based
clustering algorithm is first adopted for periodically partitioning users.
Afterward, a mutual deep Q-network (MDQN) algorithm is proposed to jointly
determine the optimal 3D trajectory and power allocation of UAVs. In contrast
to the conventional DQN algorithm, the MDQN algorithm enables the experience of
multi-agent to be input into a shared neural network to shorten the training
time with the assistance of state abstraction. Numerical results demonstrate
that: 1) the proposed MDQN algorithm is capable of converging under minor

algorithm in the multi-agent case; 2) The achievable sum rate of the NOMA
enhanced UAV network is 23% superior to the case of orthogonal multiple access

MDON algorithm, the sum rate of the network enjoys 142% and 56% gains than that
of invoking the circular trajectory and the 2D trajectory, respectively.

a target $t$ and are asked whether some subset of $X$ sums to $t$. Natural
parameters for this problem that have been studied in the literature are $n$
and $t$ as well as the maximum input number $\rm{mx}_X$ and the sum of all
input numbers $\Sigma_X$. In this paper we study the dense case of Subset Sum,
where all these parameters are polynomial in $n$. In this regime, standard
pseudo-polynomial algorithms solve Subset Sum in polynomial time $n^{O(1)}$.
  Our main question is: When can dense Subset Sum be solved in near-linear time
$\tilde{O}(n)$? We provide an essentially complete dichotomy by designing
improved algorithms and proving conditional lower bounds, thereby determining
essentially all settings of the parameters $n,t,\rm{mx}_X,\Sigma_X$ for which
dense Subset Sum is in time $\tilde{O}(n)$. For notational convenience we
assume without loss of generality that $t \ge \rm{mx}_X$ (as larger numbers can
be ignored) and $t \le \Sigma_X/2$ (using symmetry). Then our dichotomy reads
as follows:
  - By reviving and improving an additive-combinatorics-based approach by Galil
and Margalit [SICOMP'91], we show that Subset Sum is in near-linear time
$\tilde{O}(n)$ if $t \gg \rm{mx}_X \Sigma_X/n^2$.
  - We prove a matching conditional lower bound: If Subset Sum is in
near-linear time for any setting with $t \ll \rm{mx}_X \Sigma_X/n^2$, then the
Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis and the Strong k-Sum Hypothesis fail.
  We also generalize our algorithm from sets to multi-sets, albeit with
non-matching upper and lower bounds.

rigorously calculate the observables and contrast this new interferometric

this technique could allow robust high-precision measurements of the relative
astrometry of the two sources. A basic calculation suggests that angular

general noise models, including the Tsybakov model which considerably
generalizes the Massart condition by allowing the flipping probability to be
arbitrarily close to $\frac{1}{2}$ for a subset of the domain. As a corollary,
we employ an evolutionary algorithm by \cite{DBLP:conf/colt/KanadeVV10} to
obtain the first polynomial time algorithm with arbitrarily small excess error

complexes whose points lie in the tail of these noise distributions. This study
advances this line of inquiry, and demonstrates functional strong laws of large
numbers for the Euler characteristic process of random geometric complexes
formed by random points outside of an expanding ball in $\mathbb{R}^d$. When
the points are drawn from a heavy tailed distribution with a regularly varying
tail, the Euler characteristic process grows at a regularly varying rate, and
the scaled process converges uniformly and almost surely to a smooth function.
When the points are drawn from a distribution with an exponentially decaying
tail, the Euler characteristic process grows logarithmically, and the scaled
process converges to another smooth function in the same sense. All of the
limit theorems take place when the points inside the expanding ball are densely

ensures that all entities in the voting system have the same view of the

existing remote blockchain-based boardroom voting solution called Open Voting

topics to automatically annotate all remaining repositories, by training models
that recommend high-quality topic tags to developers.
  In this work, we study the application of multi-label classification
techniques to predict software repositories' topics. First, we map the large
space of user-defined topics to those featured by GitHub. The core idea is to
derive more information from projects' available documentation. Our data
contains about $152$K GitHub repositories and $228$ featured topics. Then, we
apply supervised models on repositories' textual information such as
descriptions, README files, wiki pages, and file names. We assess the
performance of our approach both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our proposed
model achieves Recall@5 and LRAP scores of $0.890$ and $0.805$, respectively.
Moreover, based on users' assessment, our approach is highly capable of
recommending a correct and complete set of topics. Finally, we use our models
to develop an online tool named \texttt{Repository Catalogue}, that
automatically predicts topics for GitHub repositories and is publicly
available.

remains as regular as the initial data during this time. If only the scaling

carefully-crafted inputs that mislead classification at test time. Recent
defenses have been shown to improve adversarial robustness by detecting
anomalous deviations from legitimate training samples at different layer
representations - a behavior normally exhibited by adversarial attacks. Despite
technical differences, all aforementioned methods share a common backbone
structure that we formalize and highlight in this contribution, as it can help
in identifying promising research directions and drawbacks of existing methods.
The first main contribution of this work is the review of these detection
methods in the form of a unifying framework designed to accommodate both
existing defenses and newer ones to come. In terms of drawbacks, the
overmentioned defenses require comparing input samples against an oversized
number of reference prototypes, possibly at different representation layers,
dramatically worsening the test-time efficiency. Besides, such defenses are
typically based on ensembling classifiers with heuristic methods, rather than
optimizing the whole architecture in an end-to-end manner to better perform
detection. As a second main contribution of this work, we introduce FADER, a
novel technique for speeding up detection-based methods. FADER overcome the
issues above by employing RBF networks as detectors: by fixing the number of
required prototypes, the runtime complexity of adversarial examples detectors
can be controlled. Our experiments outline up to 73x prototypes reduction
compared to analyzed detectors for MNIST dataset and up to 50x for CIFAR10
dataset respectively, without sacrificing classification accuracy on both clean
and adversarial data.

A/B testing allows sellers to find effective advertisement strategies such as
ad creatives or segmentations. Even though several studies propose a technique
to maximize the effect of an advertisement, there is insufficient comprehension
of the customers' offline shopping behavior invited by the online
advertisements. Herein, we study the difference in offline behavior between
customers who received online advertisements and regular customers (i.e., the
customers visits the target shop voluntary), and the duration of this
difference. We analyzed approximately three thousand users' offline behavior
with their 23.5 million location records through 31 A/B testings. We first
demonstrate the externality that customers with advertisements traverse larger
areas than those without advertisements, and this spatial difference lasts
several days after their shopping day. We then find a long-run effect of this
externality of advertising that a certain portion of the customers invited to
the offline shops revisit these shops. Finally, based on this revisit effect
findings, we utilize a causal machine learning model to propose a marketing
strategy to maximize the revisit ratio. Our results suggest that advertisements
draw customers who have different behavior traits from regular customers. This
study's findings demonstrate that a simple analysis may underrate the effects
of advertisements on businesses, and an analysis considering externality can
attract potentially valuable customers.

concept of PHY anonymity, and reveal that the receiver can unmask the sender's
identity by only analyzing the PHY information, i.e., the signaling patterns

where the receiver has more antennas than the sender in the strong receiver
case, and vice versa in the strong sender case. For each scenario, we first
investigate sender detection strategy at the receiver, and then we develop
corresponding anonymous precoding to address anonymity while guaranteeing high
receive signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) for communications. In
particular, an interference suppression anonymous precoder is first proposed,
assisted by a dedicated transmit phase equalizer for removing phase ambiguity.
Afterwards, a constructive interference anonymous precoder is further
investigated to utilize the inter-antenna interference as a beneficial element
without loss of sender's anonymity. Simulation demonstrates the proposed
anonymous precoders are able to preserve the sender's anonymity and
simultaneously guarantee high receive SINR, opening a new dimension on PHY

rely on multi-view imagery which are not readily available in practice. Recent
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that synthesize images, in contrast,
seem to acquire 3D knowledge implicitly during training: object viewpoints can
be manipulated by simply manipulating the latent codes. However, these latent

for a ring of phase-only oscillators that otherwise require explicit

based on 3d metals such as Fe and Co, possess a small SOC. To circumvent this

nonmagnetic layers of 5d heavy metals (HMs), such as Pt, to generate spin

breaking mainly engineered by interfaces. These ""self-torques"" are enhanced
around the magnetization compensation temperature (close to room temperature)

applied this procedure to hydrogen fluoride (HF), a promising tracer of the
molecular content of galaxies. In total we found 13 unique equilibrium
structures of HF binding to small water clusters of up to 4 molecules, with
binding energies ranging from 1208 to 7162 K. We computed a 22-molecules model
of amorphous solid water (ASW) surface using \textit{ab initio} molecular
dynamics simulations and carried out a systematic analysis of the binding sites
of HF, in terms of binding modes and binding energies. Considering 10 different
water clusters, we found a binding energy distribution with an average value of
$5313\pm74$ K, and a dispersion of $921\pm115$ K. Finally, the effect of the
electrostatic field of the 22 water molecules on the binding energies was
investigated incrementally by symmetry adapted perturbation theory, in order to
gauge the effect of the water environment. The results indicate that the extent

diversity-based testing techniques aim to exercise diverse behavior in the
system under test (SUT), the diversity has mainly been measured on and between
artefacts (e.g., inputs, outputs or test scripts). Here, we introduce a family
of measures to capture behavioural diversity (b-div) of test cases by comparing
their executions and failure outcomes. Using failure information to capture the
SUT behaviour has been shown to improve effectiveness of history-based test
prioritisation approaches. However, history-based techniques require reliable
test execution logs which are often not available or can be difficult to obtain
due to flaky tests, scarcity of test executions, etc. To be generally
applicable we instead propose to use mutation testing to measure behavioral
diversity by running the set of test cases on various mutated versions of the
SUT. Concretely, we propose two specific b-div measures (based on accuracy and
Matthew's correlation coefficient, respectively) and compare them with
artefact-based diversity (a-div) for prioritising the test suites of 6
different open-source projects. Our results show that our b-div measures
outperform a-div and random selection in all of the studied projects. The
improvement is substantial with an average increase in average percentage of

approximating the equilibrium distribution function, the second for
approximating the non-equilibrium distribution function, and the third one for
encoding the Boltzmann-BGK equation as well as the corresponding
boundary/initial conditions. By minimizing the residuals of the governing
equations and the mismatch between the predicted and provided boundary/initial

various benchmark flows given boundary/initial conditions, e.g., Kovasznay
flow, Taylor-Green flow, cavity flow, and micro Couette flow for Knudsen number
up to 5. For inverse problems, we focus on rarefied flows in which accurate
boundary conditions are difficult to obtain. We employ the PINN-BGK to infer
the flow field in the entire computational domain given a limited number of
interior scattered measurements on the velocity with unknown boundary
conditions. Results for the two-dimensional micro Couette and micro cavity
flows with Knudsen numbers ranging from 0.1 to 10 indicate that the PINN-BGK
can infer the velocity field in the entire domain with good accuracy. Finally,
we also present some results on using transfer learning to accelerate the

recording where speech was produced by speakers that are physically within
proximity of the recording device (""Live Speech"") from speech and other types
of audio that were played back such as traffic noise and television broadcasts
(""Distractor Audio""). In this work, we propose a deep-learning-based VTD system
that features an initial layer of learnable spectro-temporal receptive fields
(STRFs). Our approach is also shown to provide very strong performance on a
similar spoofing detection task in the ASVspoof 2019 challenge. We evaluate our
approach on a new standardized VTD database that was collected to support
research in this area. In particular, we study the effect of using learnable
STRFs compared to static STRFs or unconstrained kernels. We also show that our
system consistently improves a competitive baseline system across a wide range
of signal-to-noise ratios on spoofing detection in the presence of VTD
distractor noise.

matrices L and g, where the matrix entries are the h energy of homoclinic
intersections. We know that the sum over all h values on G is equal to the sum
of the Green matrix entries g(x,y). We also have already seen that that the
determinants of L or g are both the product of the h(x). In the case where h(x)
is the parity of dimension, the sum of the energy values was the standard Euler
characteristic and the determinant was a unit. If h(x) was the unit in the ring
then L,g are integral quadratic forms which are isospectral and inverse
matrices of each other. We prove here that the quadratic energy expression
summing over all pairs h(x)^* h(y) of intersecting sets is a signed sum of
squares of Green function entries. The quadratic energy expression is Wu
characteristic in the case when h is dimension parity. For general h, the
quadratic energy expression resembles an Ising Heisenberg type interaction. The
conjugate of g is the inverse of L if h takes unit values in a normed ring or
in the group of unitary operators in an operator algebra.

self-focal point if all geodesics loop back but not all are smoothly closed.
Umbilic points of two dimensional tri-axial ellipsoids are non-polar self-focal

manifolds of dimension $\geq 3$. We prove that ellipsoids of dimension $\geq 3$

  Self-focal points play an important role in the study of $L^{\infty}$ norms

recommend publication venues from a different perspective. We estimate the

venue and recommend the venue where the paper has the most potential impact.
However, there are two challenges to this task. First, a paper is published in
only one venue, and thus, we cannot observe the number of citations the paper
would receive if the paper were published in another venue. Secondly, the
contents of a paper and the publication venue are not statistically
independent; that is, there exist selection biases in choosing publication

treatment effect estimation problem. We use a bias correction method to
estimate the potential impact of choosing a publication venue effectively and
to recommend venues based on the potential impact of papers in each venue. We
highlight the effectiveness of our method using paper data from computer

obstacle-occupied space in a collision-free manner requires either an extensive
amount of data or high-quality demonstrations. This requirement is caused by
the fact that among the variety of maneuvers the robot can perform, it is
difficult to find the single optimal plan without many trial-and-error or an
expert who is already capable of doing so. However, given a plan performed in
obstacle-free space, it is relatively easy to find an obstacle geometry, where
this plan is optimal. We consider this ""dual"" problem of classical motion
planning and name this process of finding appropriate obstacle geometry as
hallucination. In this work, we present two different approaches to hallucinate
(1) the most constrained and (2) a minimal obstacle space where a given plan
executed during an exploration phase in a completely safe obstacle-free
environment remains optimal. We then train an end-to-end motion planner that
can produce motions to move through realistic obstacles during deployment. Both
methods are tested on a physical mobile robot in real-world cluttered
environments.

over time, the density of technical debt (technical debt divided by lines of
code) is reduced in some cases. This can be explained by either the application
of refactorings or the development of new artifacts with limited Technical
Debt. In this paper we explore the second explanation, by investigating the
relation between the amount of Technical Debt in new code and the evolution of
Technical Debt in the system. To this end, we compare the Technical Debt
Density of new code with existing code, and we investigate which of the three
major types of code changes (additions, deletions and modifications) is
primarily responsible for changes in the evolution of Technical Debt density.
Furthermore, we study whether there is a relation between code quality
practices and the 'cleanness' of new code. To obtain the required data, we have
performed a large-scale case study on twenty-seven open-source software
projects by the Apache Software Foundation, analyzing 66,661 classes and 56,890
commits. The results suggest that writing ""clean"" (or at least ""cleaner"") new
code can be an efficient strategy for reducing Technical Debt Density, and thus
preventing software decay over time. The findings also suggest that projects
adopting an explicit policy for quality improvement, e.g. through discussions
on code quality in board meetings, are associated with a higher frequency of
cleaner new code commits. Therefore, we champion the establishment of processes
that monitor the density of Technical Debt of new code to control the
accumulation of Technical Debt in a software system.

In the former, both the digital and analog beamformers are generated
independently at each AP based on the local channel state information (CSI). In
contrast, in the latter, only the digital beamformer is obtained locally at the
AP, whereas the analog beamforming matrix is generated at the central
processing unit (CPU) based on the global CSI received from all APs. We show
that the analog beamformers generated in these two HBF schemes provide
approximately the same achievable rates despite the lower complexity of D-HBF
and its lack of CSI requirement.} Furthermore, to reduce the power consumption,
we propose a novel adaptive radio frequency (RF) chain-activation (ARFA)
scheme, which dynamically activates/deactivates RF chains and their connected
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and phase shifters (PSs) at the APs based
on the CSI. For the activation of RF chains, low-complexity algorithms are
proposed, which can achieve significant improvement in energy efficiency (EE)

unsaturated flow problem within complex heterogeneous fractured porous media.
Mathematically, each of the dual continua is modeled by a multiscale Richards
equation (for pressure head), and these equations are coupled to one another by
transfer terms. On its own, Richards equation is already a nonlinear partial
differential equation, and it is exceedingly difficult to solve numerically due
to the extra nonlinear dependencies involving the soil water. To deal with
multiple scales, our strategy is that starting from a microscopic scale, we
upscale the coupled system of dual-continuum Richards equations via
homogenization by the two-scale asymptotic expansion, to obtain a homogenized
system, at an intermediate scale (level). Based on a hierarchical approach, the
homogenization's effective coefficients are computed through solving the
arising cell problems. To tackle the nonlinearity, after time discretization,
we use Picard iteration procedure for linearization of the homogenized Richards
equations. At each Picard iteration, some degree of multiscale still remains
from the intermediate level, so we utilize the generalized multiscale finite
element method (GMsFEM) combining with a multi-continuum approach, to upscale
the homogenized system to a macroscopic (coarse-grid) level. This scheme
involves building uncoupled and coupled multiscale basis functions, which are
used not only to construct coarse-grid solution approximation with high
accuracy but also (with the coupled multiscale basis) to capture the
interactions among continua. These prospects and convergence are demonstrated
by several numerical results for the proposed method.

the parameter that controls the mass of the heavy field(s) that would be
integrated out in the process of EFT reduction. By numerical methods, we
demonstrate that the introduction of a heavy field indeed resolves the caustic

study the cosmological application of the model. By expanding the equations
with respect to the curvature scale of the field space, we prove that the EFT
reduction is successfully done by taking the limit of infinite curvature, both

leading-order computation is consistently conducted and shows that the EFT
reduction breaks down in the limit of vanishing sound speed of the

designing a channel decorrelation mechanism to extract the inter-channel
differential information to enhance the multi-channel encoder representation.
We compare the proposed methods with two strong state-of-the-art baselines.
Experimental results on the multi-channel reverberant WSJ0 2-mix dataset

over the past few years. Nevertheless, most existing algorithms merely take the
consensus information among different views into consideration for clustering.
Actually, it may hinder the multi-view clustering performance in real-life
applications, since different views usually contain diverse statistic
properties. To address this problem, we propose a novel Tensor-based Intrinsic
Subspace Representation Learning (TISRL) for multi-view clustering in this
paper. Concretely, the rank preserving decomposition is proposed firstly to
effectively deal with the diverse statistic information contained in different
views. Then, to achieve the intrinsic subspace representation, the
tensor-singular value decomposition based low-rank tensor constraint is also
utilized in our method. It can be seen that specific information contained in
different views is fully investigated by the rank preserving decomposition, and
the high-order correlations of multi-view data are also mined by the low-rank
tensor constraint. The objective function can be optimized by an augmented
Lagrangian multiplier based alternating direction minimization algorithm.
Experimental results on nine common used real-world multi-view datasets
illustrate the superiority of TISRL.

achieve a faster decoding speed but at the sacrifice of translation accuracy.
To remedy a flawed translation by non-autoregressive models, a promising
approach is to train a conditional masked translation model (CMTM), and refine
the generated results within several iterations. Unfortunately, such approach
hardly considers the \textit{sequential dependency} among target words, which
inevitably results in a translation degradation. Hence, instead of solely
training a Transformer-based CMTM, we propose a Self-Review Mechanism to infuse
sequential information into it. Concretely, we insert a left-to-right mask to
the same decoder of CMTM, and then induce it to autoregressively review whether
each generated word from CMTM is supposed to be replaced or kept. The
experimental results (WMT14 En$\leftrightarrow$De and WMT16
En$\leftrightarrow$Ro) demonstrate that our model uses dramatically less
training computations than the typical CMTM, as well as outperforms several

transmit power for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) conducting covert

surveillance from airborne platforms, where it is vital for a UAV's signal
transmission to be undetectable by those within the surveillance region.
Specifically, we maximize the communication quality to a legitimate ground
receiver outside the surveillance region, subject to: a covertness constraint,
a maximum transmit power constraint, and a physical location constraint
determined by the required surveillance quality. We provide an explicit
solution to the optimization problem for one of the most practical constraint
combinations. For other constraint combinations, we determine feasible regions
for flight, that can then be searched to establish the UAV's optimal location.
In many cases, the 2-dimensional optimal location is achieved by a
1-dimensional search. We discuss two heuristic approaches to UAV placement, and

providing encodings of the observed structures that act as bottom-up

show that the current-induced NMR shift is reversed by a chirality reversal of
the tellurium crystal structure. This result is the first direct evidence of
crystal-chirality-induced spin polarization, which is an inorganic-bulk-crystal

shrinks due to gravitational radiation, the power and speed of this
binary-induced inspiral wind may (depending on pair loading) secularly
increase, leading to self-interaction and internal shocks in the outflow beyond
the binary orbit. The magnetized forward shock can generate coherent radio

of the high-order numerical schemes [D'Elia et al., Acta Numer., (2020); Leng

(shifted-symmetric) piecewise quadratic polynomial collocation for solving the
linear nonlocal diffusion model, which has the {\em symmetric positive definite
system} and satisfies the discrete maximum principle. Using Faulhaber's formula
and Riemann zeta function, the perturbation error for symmetric positive
definite system and nonsymmetric indefinite systems are given. Then the
detailed proof of the convergence analysis for the nonlocal models with the
general horizon parameter $\delta=\mathcal{O}\left(h^\beta\right)$,
$\beta\geq0$ are provided. More concretely, the global error is
$\mathcal{O}\left(h^{\min\left\{2,1+\beta\right\}}\right)$ if $\delta$ is not
set as a grid point, but it shall recover
$\mathcal{O}\left(h^{\max\left\{2,4-2\beta\right\}}\right)$ when $\delta$ is
set as a grid point. We also prove that the shifted-symmetric scheme is
asymptotically compatible, which has the global error
$\mathcal{O}\left(h^{\min\left\{2,2\beta\right\}}\right)$ as
$\delta,h\rightarrow 0$. The numerical experiments (including two-dimensional
case) are performed to verify the convergence.

re-identification (ReID) struggled to redevelop official benchmarks to provide
various supervisions, which requires prohibitive human labors. In this paper,
we seek to achieve the similar goal but do not involve more human efforts. To
this end, we introduce a novel framework, which successfully encodes both
geometric local features and global representations to distinguish vehicle
instances, optimized only by the supervision from official ID labels.
Specifically, given our insight that objects in ReID share similar geometric
characteristics, we propose to borrow self-supervised representation learning
to facilitate geometric features discovery. To condense these features, we
introduce an interpretable attention module, with the core of local maxima
aggregation instead of fully automatic learning, whose mechanism is completely
understandable and whose response map is physically reasonable. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first that perform self-supervised learning to
discover geometric features. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three most
popular datasets for vehicle ReID, i.e., VeRi-776, CityFlow-ReID, and
VehicleID. We report our state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances and promising

the expansion of the universe on the two polarization modes, the so-called ""+""

when it is propagating through the curved background. By direct computations of
the polarization angle, we show that different epochs, radiation-, matter- and
$\Lambda$-dominated, have different effects on the polarization. In particular,
for a GW emitted by a binary system, we find explicitly the relation between
the change of the polarization angle $|\Delta \varphi|$ and the redshift $z_s$

second-order feature interactions and FMs with sparse regularization are called
sparse FMs. Such regularizations enable feature selection, which selects the
most relevant features for accurate prediction, and therefore they can
contribute to the improvement of the model accuracy and interpretability.
However, because FMs use second-order feature interactions, the selection of
features often causes the loss of many relevant feature interactions in the
resultant models. In such cases, FMs with regularization specially designed for
feature interaction selection trying to achieve interaction-level sparsity may
be preferred instead of those just for feature selection trying to achieve
feature-level sparsity. In this paper, we present a new regularization scheme
for feature interaction selection in FMs. The proposed regularizer is an upper
bound of the $\ell_1$ regularizer for the feature interaction matrix, which is
computed from the parameter matrix of FMs. For feature interaction selection,
our proposed regularizer makes the feature interaction matrix sparse without a
restriction on sparsity patterns imposed by the existing methods. We also
describe efficient proximal algorithms for the proposed FMs and present
theoretical analyses of both existing and the new regularize. In addition, we
will discuss how our ideas can be applied or extended to more accurate feature
selection and other related models such as higher-order FMs and the all-subsets
model. The analysis and experimental results on synthetic and real-world

Chamber (TPC) to search for Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay (NLDBD) with
ton-scale isotope mass and beyond. A meter-sized plane, tiled with an array of
CMOS integrated sensors called Topmetal that directly collect charge without
gas avalanche gain, is to be deployed into a high-pressure gaseous TPC with
working gases containing suitable NLDBD candidate isotopes such as Xe-136 and
Se-82. The Topmetal sensor has an electronic noise <30 e- per pixel, which
allows the detector to reach <1% FWHM energy resolution at the NLDBD Q-value
for both Xe-136 and 82SeF6 gases by measuring ionization charges alone. The
elimination of charge avalanche gain allows the direct sensing of slow-drifting
ions, which enables the use of highly electronegative gas SeF6 in which free
electrons do not exist. It supports the swapping of working gases without
hardware modification, which is a unique way to validate signals against
radioactive backgrounds. Since the sensor manufacturing and plane assembling
could leverage unaltered industrial mass-production processes, stability,
uniformity, scalability, and cost-effectiveness that are required for ton-scale
experiments could all be reached. The strengths of TPC such as 3D ionization
tracking and decay daughter tagging are retained. This development could lead
to a competitive NLDBD experiment at and above ton-scale. The conceptual
considerations, simulations, and initial prototyping are discussed.

other are compared more often than when they are placed far apart. We introduce
a model that allows product competition effects mediated by their relative
position in the display. This model naturally produces an increased competition
on products located closer together, inducing demand correlations based on
products proximity with their competitors in the shelf, and not only their
relative characteristics. We fit this model to experimental data from physical
retail stores and in online product displays.The proposed model shows this
effect to be significant; moreover, this model outperforms traditional models
in fit and prediction power, and shows that ignoring the shelf-implied
competition generates a bias in the price sensitivity, affecting price and
promotion strategies. The proposed model was used to evaluate different shelf
displays, and to evaluate and select displays with higher profitability, by
exploiting the influence on competition among products to shift demand to
higher profitability products. Finally, from the model,we generate
recommendations for retail managers to construct better shelf designs;testing
these suggestions on our fitted model on retail store data, we achieve a 3%

favorably applied to real-world scenarios in which pixel-level labels are hard
to be obtained. In most of the existing UDA methods, all target data are
assumed to be introduced simultaneously. Yet, the data are usually presented
sequentially in the real world. Moreover, Continual UDA, which deals with more
practical scenarios with multiple target domains in the continual learning
setting, has not been actively explored. In this light, we propose Continual
UDA for semantic segmentation based on a newly designed Expanding
Target-specific Memory (ETM) framework. Our novel ETM framework contains
Target-specific Memory (TM) for each target domain to alleviate catastrophic
forgetting. Furthermore, a proposed Double Hinge Adversarial (DHA) loss leads
the network to produce better UDA performance overall. Our design of the TM and
training objectives let the semantic segmentation network adapt to the current
target domain while preserving the knowledge learned on previous target
domains. The model with the proposed framework outperforms other
state-of-the-art models in continual learning settings on standard benchmarks
such as GTA5, SYNTHIA, CityScapes, IDD, and Cross-City datasets. The source

assumed, which means that the order of the cells along the different layers can

be periodic immediately after the first lap, which enables to reduce
significantly the computational cost when testing all the permutations. In view
of optimizing the production, a functional corresponding to the average growth
rate along depth and for one lap is introduced. A suboptimal but explicit
solution is proposed and compared numerically to the optimal permutation and
other strategies for different cases. Finally, the expected gains in growth

  The distance between an optimal fractional solution and an optimal integral
solution (called proximity) is an important measure. A classical result by Cook
et al.~(Math. Program., 1986) shows that it is at most $\Delta^{\Theta(d)}$
where $\Delta$ is the largest coefficient in the constraint matrix.
  Another important measure studies the change in an optimal solution if the
right-hand side $b$ is replaced by another right-hand side $b'$. The distance
between an optimal solution $x$ w.r.t.~$b$ and an optimal solution $x'$
w.r.t.~$b'$ (called sensitivity) is similarly bounded, i. e., $\lVert b-b'
\rVert_{1}\cdot \Delta^{\Theta(d)}$, also shown by Cook et al.
  Even after more than thirty years, these bounds are essentially the best
known bounds for these measures.
  While some lower bounds are known for these measures, they either only work
for very small values of $\Delta$, require negative entries in the constraint
matrix, or have fractional right-hand sides.
  Hence, these lower bounds often do not correspond to instances from
algorithmic problems.
  This work presents for each $\Delta > 0$ and each $d > 0$ ILPs of the above
type with non-negative constraint matrices such that their proximity and
sensitivity is at least $\Delta^{\Theta(d)}$.
  Furthermore, these instances are closely related to instances of the Bin
Packing problem as they form a subset of columns of the configuration ILP.
  We thereby show that the results of Cook et al. are indeed tight, even for
instances arising naturally from problems in combinatorial optimization.

each individual is either active or inactive. The diffusion is driven by two
characteristics: the network structure and the diffusion mechanism represented
by an aggregation function. We distinguish between two diffusion mechanisms
(probabilistic, deterministic) and focus on two types of aggregation functions
(strict, Boolean). Under strict aggregation functions, polarization of the
society cannot happen, and its state evolves towards a mixture of infinitely
many active and infinitely many inactive agents, or towards a homogeneous
society. Under Boolean aggregation functions, the diffusion process becomes
deterministic and the contagion model of Morris (2000) becomes a particular
case of our framework. Polarization can then happen. Our dynamics also allows
for cycles in both cases. The network structure is not relevant for these
questions, but is important for establishing irreducibility, at the price of a

that further offloads operations which would usually be performed by a central
server. The server becomes more like an assistant coordinating clients to work
together rather than micro-managing the workforce as in traditional DML. One of
the greatest advantages of federated learning is the additional privacy and
security guarantees it affords. Federated learning architecture relies on smart
devices, such as smartphones and IoT sensors, that collect and process their
own data, so sensitive information never has to leave the client device.
Rather, clients train a sub-model locally and send an encrypted update to the
central server for aggregation into the global model. These strong privacy
guarantees make federated learning an attractive choice in a world where data
breaches and information theft are common and serious threats. This survey
outlines the landscape and latest developments in data privacy and security for
federated learning. We identify the different mechanisms used to provide
privacy and security, such as differential privacy, secure multi-party
computation and secure aggregation. We also survey the current attack models,
identifying the areas of vulnerability and the strategies adversaries use to
penetrate federated systems. The survey concludes with a discussion on the open
challenges and potential directions of future work in this increasingly popular

subject to a congestion charge. The platform determines the ride prices over
the transportation network to maximize its profit, while the regulatory agency
imposes the congestion charge to reduce traffic congestion in the urban core. A
network economic equilibrium model is proposed to capture the intimate
interactions among passenger demand, driver supply, passenger and driver
waiting times, platform pricing, vehicle repositioning and flow balance over
the transportation network. The overall optimal pricing problem is cast as a
non-convex program. An algorithm is proposed to approximately compute its
optimal solution, and a tight upper bound is established to evaluate its
performance loss with respect to the globally optimal solution. Using the
proposed model, we compare the impacts of three forms of congestion charge: (a)
a one-directional cordon charge on ride-sourcing vehicles that enter the
congestion area; (b) a bi-directional cordon charge on ride-sourcing vehicles
that enter or exit the congestion area; (c) a trip-based congestion charge on
all ride-sourcing trips. We show that the one-directional congestion charge not
only reduces the ride-sourcing traffic in the congestion area, but also reduces
the travel cost outside the congestion zone and benefits passengers in these
underserved areas. We further show that compared to other congestion charges,
the one-directional cordon charge is more effective in congestion mitigation:
to achieve the same congestion-mitigation target, it imposes a smaller cost on
passengers, drivers, and the platform. On the other hand, compared with the
other charges, the trip-based congestion charge is more effective in
revenue-raising: to raise the same tax revenue, it leads to a smaller loss to
passengers, drivers, and the platform.

the presence or absence of certain discrete symmetries. For non-hermitian
operators we in addition need to specify the type of spectral gap. They come in
the flavor of a point gap or a line gap. Since the presence of a line gap
implies the existence of a point gap, there is usually more than one
mathematical classification applicable to a physical system. That raises the
question: which of these gap-type classifications is physically meaningful?
  To decide this question, I propose a simple criterion, namely the choice of
physically relevant states. This generalizes the notion of Fermi projection
that plays a crucial role in the topological classification of fermionic
condensed matter systems, and enters as an auxiliary quantity in the bulk
classification of photonic and magnonic crystals. After that the classification
is entirely algorithmic, the system's topology is encoded in (pairs of)
projections with symmetries and constraints. A crucial point in my
investigation is the relevance of diagonalizability. Even for existing
topological classifications of non-hermitian systems diagonalizability needs to
be assumed to ensure that continuous deformations of the hamiltonian lead to
continuous deformations of the spectra, projections and unitaries.

immediate rewards frequently have lower transaction costs than delayed rewards

whether the use of hypothetical - versus real - payments affects the

linearly with visual extinction $A\rm_V$ when $A\rm_V$ is less than 3 mag. It

imply tight chemical evolution and spatial occupation between OH and $^{13}$CO.
No obvious correlation is found between column density and nonthermal velocity
dispersion of OH and HI Narrow Self-Absorption (HINSA), indicating different
chemical evolution and spatial volume occupation between OH and HINSA. Using
the age information of HINSA analysis, OH abundance $X$(OH) is found to
increase linearly with cloud age, which is consistent with previous

a new model which is called the \textit{Stochastic Linear Combination of
Non-linear Regressions} model. However, due to the high non-convexity of the
problem, there is no previous work study how to estimate the model. In this
paper, we provide the first study on how to estimate the model efficiently and
scalably. Specifically, we first show that with some mild assumptions, if the
variate vector $x$ is multivariate Gaussian, then there is an algorithm whose
output vectors have $\ell_2$-norm estimation errors of $O(\sqrt{\frac{p}{n}})$
with high probability, where $p$ is the dimension of $x$ and $n$ is the number
of samples. The key idea of the proof is based on an observation motived by the
Stein's lemma. Then we extend our result to the case where $x$ is bounded and
sub-Gaussian using the zero-bias transformation, which could be seen as a
generalization of the classic Stein's lemma. We also show that with some
additional assumptions there is an algorithm whose output vectors have
$\ell_\infty$-norm estimation errors of
$O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}}+\sqrt{\frac{p}{n}})$ with high probability. We also
provide a concrete example to show that there exists some link function which
satisfies the previous assumptions. Finally, for both Gaussian and sub-Gaussian
cases we propose a faster sub-sampling based algorithm and show that when the
sub-sample sizes are large enough then the estimation errors will not be
sacrificed by too much. Experiments for both cases support our theoretical
results.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies and
provides theoretical guarantees for the stochastic linear combination of

cross-section absorption of rare earths like erbium, it is necessary to obtain
an efficient energy transfer mechanism between the host matrix and the rare
earth to obtain high luminescence efficiency. Our strategy is then to elaborate
some nanostructures that could introduce additional intermediate electronic
levels within the gap thanks to the presence of structural defects (point
defects, grain boundaries{\ldots}) and could lead to energy transfer from the
AlN matrix to the rare earth.Doped and non-doped AlN films were prepared by
radio frequency magnetron sputtering by using different experimental conditions
that will be detailed. It will notably be shown how a negative polarization of
samples during deposition allows obtaining crystalline morphologies ranging
from the classical columnar structure to a highly disordered polycrystalline
structure with grains of several nanometers (nearly amorphous). The
nanostructures of the films could be categorized in three types: 1) type 1 was
nanocolumnar (width of column ~ 15 nm), 2) type 2 was made of short columns
(width of column ~ 10 nm) and 3) the last type was made of equiaxed
nanocrystallites (size of grains ~3-4 nm).High-resolution photoluminescence
spectroscopy was performed to characterize their optical behaviour. The samples
were excited by the laser wavelengths at 458, 488 or 514 nm. A broad
photoluminescence band was observed centred around 520 nm in columnar samples.
In the same energy range, the highly resolved spectra also showed several sharp
emission peaks. This fine structure could be attributed to erbium transitions.
This fine structure tended to disappear going from type 1 to type 3 samples.
Indeed, the relative intensity of the peaks decreased and their full width at
half maximum increased. This change could be related to the density of defects
that increased when the size of the grains decreased. The photoluminescence
properties of the films in the visible range will be discussed in relation with
their structure.

prove existence of several new quasipatterns. The most surprising are
hexa-rolls: periodic and quasiperiodic patterns made from the superposition of
hexagons and rolls (stripes) oriented in almost any direction with respect to
each other and with any relative translation; these bifurcate directly from the
featureless solution. In addition, we find quasipatterns made from the
superposition of hexagons with unequal amplitude (provided the coefficient of
the quadratic nonlinearity is small). We consider the periodic case as well,
and extend the class of known solutions, including the superposition of
hexagons and rolls. While we have focused on the Swift-Hohenberg equation, our
work contributes to the general question of what periodic or quasiperiodic
patterns should be found generically in pattern-forming problems on the plane.

(BN) Layer in benefiting convergence and generalization. However, BN requires
extra memory and float-point calculation. Moreover, BN would be inaccurate on
micro-batch, as it depends on batch statistics. In this paper, we address these
problems by simplifying BN regularization while keeping two fundamental impacts
of BN layers, i.e., data decorrelation and adaptive learning rate. We propose a
novel normalization method, named MimicNorm, to improve the convergence and
efficiency in network training. MimicNorm consists of only two light
operations, including modified weight mean operations (subtract mean values
from weight parameter tensor) and one BN layer before loss function (last BN
layer). We leverage the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory to prove that our
weight mean operation whitens activations and transits network into the chaotic
regime like BN layer, and consequently, leads to an enhanced convergence. The
last BN layer provides autotuned learning rates and also improves accuracy.
Experimental results show that MimicNorm achieves similar accuracy for various
network structures, including ResNets and lightweight networks like ShuffleNet,
with a reduction of about 20% memory consumption. The code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Kid-key/MimicNorm.

problems or user equilibrium problems. However, some problems such as the
maximum flow (MF) problem, minimum-cost-maximum-flow (MCMF) problem, and

PPA-based research, a novel framework, the capacitated physarum polycephalum

link flow in the PPA. To prove the validity of the CPPA, we developed three
applications of the CPPA, i.e., the CPPA for the MF problem (CPPA-MF), the CPPA
for the MCFC problem, and the CPPA for the link-capacitated traffic assignment

the problems successfully. Some of them demonstrate efficiency compared to the
baseline algorithms. The experimental results prove the validation of using the
CPPA framework to control link flow in the PPA is valid. The CPPA is also very
robust and easy to implement since it could be successfully applied in three

control the maximum among flow flowing through links in the PPA, the CPPA could
tackle more complex real-world problems in the future.

their utility in many applications such as cellular-based localization, channel
modeling, and link establishment for mm-wave initial access (IA). Leveraging
tools from stochastic geometry, a Boolean model is used to statistically
characterize the random locations, orientations, and sizes of reflectors, e.g.,
buildings. Assuming non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation is due to first-order
(i.e., single-bounce) reflections, and that reflectors can either facilitate or
block reflections, the distribution of the path length (i.e., absolute time
delay) of the first-arriving MPC is derived. This result is then used to obtain
the first NLOS bias distribution in the localization literature that is based
on the absolute delay of the first-arriving MPC for outdoor time-of-flight

well with commonly assumed gamma and exponential NLOS bias models in the
literature, which were only attainted previously through heuristic or indirect

environmental obstacles affect the AOA and also represents the first AOA

higher-order PGMs. We then embed the message passing updates into a neural
network to provide the inductive bias of the inference algorithm in end-to-end
learning. This gives us a model that is flexible enough to accommodate domain

methods for constructing higher-order factors that are conditioned on node and

Reynolds number ($\Rey$) of $50,000$ are examined using spectral proper
orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) which considers all three velocity components
in a numerical database. The SPOD eigenvalues at a given streamwise ($x$)
location are functions of azimuthal wavenumber ($m$), frequency ($\Str$), and
SPOD index ($n$). By $x/D =10$, two specific modes dominate the fluctuation
energy: (i) the vortex shedding (VS) mode with $m=1, \Str =0.135, n=1$, and
(ii) the double helix (DH) mode with $m=2, \Str \rightarrow 0, n=1$. The VS
mode is more energetic than the DH mode in the near wake but, in the far wake,
it is the DH mode which is dominant. The DH mode, when scaled with local
turbulent velocity and length scales, shows self-similarity in eigenvalues and
eigenmodes while the VS mode, which is a global mode, does not exhibit strict
self-similarity. Modes $m = 0$, 3 and 4, although subdominant, also make a
significant net contribution to the fluctuation energy, and their eigenspectra
are evaluated. The reconstruction of TKE and Reynolds shear stress, $\langle
u'_{x} u'_{r} \rangle$, is evaluated by varying $(m,\Str,n)$ combinations.
Higher SPOD modes contribute significantly to the TKE, especially near the
centerline. In contrast, reconstruction of $\langle u'_{x}u'_{r}\rangle $
requires far fewer modes: $|m| \leq 4 $, $|\Str| \leq 1$ and $n \leq 3$. Among
azimuthal modes, $m=1$ and $2$ are the leading contributors to both TKE and
$\langle u'_{x}u'_{r} \rangle $. While $m=1$ captures the slope of the
shear-stress profile near the centerline, $m=2$ is important to capture
$\langle u'_{x}u'_{r} \rangle $ at and near its peak. SPOD is also performed in
the vicinity of the disk to describe the modal transition to the principal
contributors in the wake.

Agents face balancing constraints between their customers consumption plus
intraday sales and their production plus intraday purchases. They have
continuously updated forecast of their customers consumption at maturity with
decreasing volatility error. Forecasts are prone to idiosyncratic noise as well
as common noise (weather). Agents production capacities are subject to
independent random outages, which are each modelled by a Markov chain. The
equilibrium price is defined as the price that minimises trading cost plus
imbalance cost of each agent and satisfies the usual market clearing condition.
Existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium are proved, and we show that the
equilibrium price and the optimal trading strategies are martingales. The main
economic insights are the following. (i) When there is no uncertainty on
generation, it is shown that the market price is a convex combination of
forecasted marginal cost of each agent, with deterministic weights.
Furthermore, the equilibrium market price follows Almgren and Chriss's model
and we identify the fundamental part as well as the permanent market impact. It
turns out that heterogeneity across agents is a necessary condition for the
Samuelson's effect to hold. (ii) When there is production uncertainty, the
price volatility becomes stochastic but converges to the case without
production uncertainty when the number of agents increases to infinity.
Further, on a two-agent case, we show that the potential outages of a low
marginal cost producer reduces her sales position.

tasks is achieved. Among these methods, Gradient-based meta-learning algorithms
are a specific sub-class that excel at quick adaptation to new tasks with
limited data. This demonstrates their ability to acquire transferable
knowledge, a capability that is central to human learning. However, the
existing meta-learning approaches only depend on the current task information
during the adaptation, and do not share the meta-knowledge of how a similar
task has been adapted before. To address this gap, we propose a 'Path-aware'
model-agnostic meta-learning approach. Specifically, our approach not only
learns a good initialization for adaptation, it also learns an optimal way to
adapt these parameters to a set of task-specific parameters, with learnable
update directions, learning rates and, most importantly, the way updates evolve
over different time-steps. Compared to the existing meta-learning methods, our
approach offers: (a) The ability to learn gradient-preconditioning at different
time-steps of the inner-loop, thereby modeling the dynamic learning behavior
shared across tasks, and (b) The capability of aggregating the learning context
through the provision of direct gradient-skip connections from the old
time-steps, thus avoiding overfitting and improving generalization. In essence,
our approach not only learns a transferable initialization, but also models the
optimal update directions, learning rates, and task-specific learning trends.
Specifically, in terms of learning trends, our approach determines the way
update directions shape up as the task-specific learning progresses and how the
previous update history helps in the current update. Our approach is simple to
implement and demonstrates faster convergence. We report significant
performance improvements on a number of FSL datasets.

twisted bivariant groups. Local contributions to the trace map give rise to
quadratic refinements of the classical local terms, and some
$\mathbb{A}^1$-enumerative invariants, such as the local $\mathbb{A}^1$-Brouwer

prove an analogue of a theorem of Varshavsky, which states that for a

binarized into 1 bit, have been widely studied in recent years due to its great
benefit of highly accelerated computation and substantially reduced memory
footprint that appeal to the development of resource constrained devices. In
contrast to previous methods tending to reduce the quantization error for
training BNN structures, we argue that the binarized convolution process owns
an increasing linearity towards the target of minimizing such error, which in
turn hampers BNN's discriminative ability. In this paper, we re-investigate and
tune proper non-linear modules to fix that contradiction, leading to a strong
baseline which achieves state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale
ImageNet dataset in terms of accuracy and training efficiency. To go further,
we find that the proposed BNN model still has much potential to be compressed
by making a better use of the efficient binary operations, without losing
accuracy. In addition, the limited capacity of the BNN model can also be
increased with the help of group execution. Based on these insights, we are
able to improve the baseline with an additional 4~5% top-1 accuracy gain even
with less computational cost. Our code will be made public at

double-uncertainty weighted method for semi-supervised segmentation based on

model by penalizing their inconsistent prediction on both labeled and unlabeled

double-uncertainty, i.e. segmentation uncertainty and feature uncertainty. It
is the first to extend segmentation uncertainty estimation to feature
uncertainty, which reveals the capability to capture information among
channels. A learnable uncertainty consistency loss is designed for the
unsupervised learning process in an interactive manner between prediction and
uncertainty. With no ground-truth for supervision, it can still incentivize
more accurate teacher's predictions and facilitate the model to reduce
uncertain estimations. Furthermore, our proposed double-uncertainty serves as a
weight on each inconsistency penalty to balance and harmonize supervised and
unsupervised training processes. We validate the proposed feature uncertainty
and loss function through qualitative and quantitative analyses. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art uncertainty-based

wide bandgap top-cell materials with prospects of a fully earth-abundant,
stable and efficient tandem solar cell. Thin film chalcogenides (TFCs) such as
the Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) could be suitable top-cell materials. However, TFCs have
the disadvantage that generally at least one high temperature step (>500 C) is
needed during the synthesis, which could contaminate the Si bottom cell. Here,
we systematically investigate the monolithic integration of CZTS on a Si bottom
solar cell. A thermally resilient double-sided Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact
(TOPCon) structure is used as bottom cell. A thin (<25 nm) TiN layer between
the top and bottom cells, doubles as diffusion barrier and recombination layer.
We show that TiN successfully mitigates in-diffusion of CZTS elements into the
c-Si bulk during the high temperature sulfurization process, and find no
evidence of electrically active deep Si bulk defects in samples protected by
just 10 nm TiN. Post-process minority carrier lifetime in Si exceeded 1.5 ,s.
i.e., a promising implied open-circuit voltage (i-Voc) of 715 mV after the high

complex semiconductors on Si using high temperature steps is technically
feasible, and can potentially lead to efficient monolithically integrated

find strong splitting in the s-process elements of \ion{Ba}{ii} $6141.713$ \AA\

decomposition of such profiles allows us to distinguish four shell components,
two expanding and two in-falling toward the central star, which are subject to

Two special cases of animals that differ from the rest were also discussed. Our

enhance low light images by penalizing the pixel-wise loss of low light and

1) the need of pairs of low light and normal light images for training, 2) the
poor performance for dark images, 3) the amplification of noise. To alleviate
these problems, in this paper, we propose a two-stage unsupervised method that
decomposes the low light image enhancement into a pre-enhancement and a
post-refinement problem. In the first stage, we pre-enhance a low light image

the image quality. The experimental results show that our method outperforms
previous methods on four benchmark datasets. In addition, we show that our

mission-specific payload data delivery. In particular, 5G networks need to
support three typical usage scenarios, namely, enhanced mobile broadband
(eMBB), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and massive
machine-type communications (mMTC). On the one hand, UAVs can be leveraged as
cost-effective aerial platforms to provide ground users with enhanced
communication services by exploiting their high cruising altitude and
controllable maneuverability in three-dimensional (3D) space. On the other
hand, providing such communication services simultaneously for both UAV and
ground users poses new challenges due to the need for ubiquitous 3D signal

requirement of high-performance wireless communications, the ability to support
effective and efficient sensing as well as network intelligence is also
essential for 5G-and-beyond 3D heterogeneous wireless networks with coexisting
aerial and ground users. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of
the latest research efforts on integrating UAVs into cellular networks, with an

graphs within the paradigm of graph percolation. It has been recently observed
that urban networks show a critical percolation transition when a fraction of
edges are removed. The resulting strongly connected components form a cluster
structure whose size distribution follows a power law with critical exponent
$\tau$. We start by analyzing how the networks react when subjected to
increasingly widespread random edge removal and the effect of spatial
correlations with power-law decay. We observe a progressive decrease of $\tau$
as spatial correlations grow. A similar phenomenon happens when real traffic
data (UBER) is used to delete congested graph edges: during low congestion
periods $\tau$ is close to that obtained for uncorrelated percolation, while
during rush hours the exponent becomes closer to the one obtained from
spatially correlated edge removal. We show that spatial correlations seem to
play an important role to model different traffic regimes. We finally present
some preliminary evidence that, at criticality, the largest clusters display
spatial predictability and that cluster configurations form a taxonomy with few
main clades: only a finite number of breakup patterns, specific for each city,
exists. This holds both for random percolation and real traffic, where the
three largest clusters are well localized and spatially distinct. This
consistent cluster organization is strongly influenced by local topographical
structures such as rivers and bridges.

obtains the common shared multi-view subspace representation, which can be used
to get clustering results by employing the standard spectral clustering
algorithm. As an end-to-end trainable framework, the proposed method fully
investigates the valuable information of multiple views. Comprehensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and

artificial creatures are lagging behind. The key foundation is an internal
representation of the body that the agent - human, animal, or robot - has
developed. In the biological realm, evidence has been accumulated by diverse
disciplines giving rise to the concepts of body image, body schema, and others.
In robotics, a model of the robot is an indispensable component that enables to
control the machine. In this article I compare the character of body
representations in biology with their robotic counterparts and relate that to
the differences in performance that we observe. I put forth a number of axes
regarding the nature of such body models: fixed vs. plastic, amodal vs. modal,
explicit vs. implicit, serial vs. parallel, modular vs. holistic, and
centralized vs. distributed. An interesting trend emerges: on many of the axes,
there is a sequence from robot body models, over body image, body schema, to
the body representation in lower animals like the octopus. In some sense,
robots have a lot in common with Ian Waterman - ""the man who lost his body"" -
in that they rely on an explicit, veridical body model (body image taken to the
extreme) and lack any implicit, multimodal representation (like the body
schema) of their bodies. I will then detail how robots can inform the
biological sciences dealing with body representations and finally, I will study
which of the features of the ""body in the brain"" should be transferred to
robots, giving rise to more adaptive and resilient, self-calibrating machines.

the PPC setup studied in this paper generalizes all the previous MDS coded PPC

the low hit rate in the register file cache.
  In this paper, we propose the Latency-Tolerant Register File (LTRF)
architecture to achieve low latency in a two-level hierarchical structure while
keeping power consumption low. We observe that compile-time interval analysis
enables us to divide GPU program execution into intervals with an accurate
estimate of a warp's aggregate register working-set within each interval. The
key idea of LTRF is to prefetch the estimated register working-set from the
main register file to the register file cache under software control, at the
beginning of each interval, and overlap the prefetch latency with the execution
of other warps. We observe that register bank conflicts while prefetching the
registers could greatly reduce the effectiveness of LTRF. Therefore, we devise
a compile-time register renumbering technique to reduce the likelihood of
register bank conflicts. Our experimental results show that LTRF enables
high-capacity yet long-latency main GPU register files, paving the way for
various optimizations. As an example optimization, we implement the main
register file with emerging high-density high-latency memory technologies,
enabling 8X larger capacity and improving overall GPU performance by 34%.

specific object instances is a challenging task. Complex scenes contain
multiple semantics and objects, which are frequently cluttered or ambiguous,
thus hampering the performance of inpainting models. Conventional techniques
often rely on structural information such as object contours in multi-stage
approaches that generate unreliable results and boundaries. In this work, we
propose a novel deep learning model to alter a complex urban scene by removing
a user-specified portion of the image and coherently inserting a new object
(e.g. car or pedestrian) in that scene. Inspired by recent works on image
inpainting, our proposed method leverages the semantic segmentation to model
the content and structure of the image, and learn the best shape and location
of the object to insert. To generate reliable results, we design a new decoder
block that combines the semantic segmentation and generation task to guide
better the generation of new objects and scenes, which have to be semantically
consistent with the image. Our experiments, conducted on two large-scale
datasets of urban scenes (Cityscapes and Indian Driving), show that our
proposed approach successfully address the problem of semantically-guided
inpainting of complex urban scene.

of science. We address the problem of inferring a causal direction from two
observed discrete symbolic sequences $X$ and $Y$. We present a framework which
relies on lossless compressors for inferring context-free grammars (CFGs) from
sequence pairs and quantifies the extent to which the grammar inferred from one
sequence compresses the other sequence. We infer $X$ causes $Y$ if the grammar
inferred from $X$ better compresses $Y$ than in the other direction. To put
this notion to practice, we propose three models that use the
Compression-Complexity Measures (CCMs) - Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity and
Effort-To-Compress (ETC) to infer CFGs and discover causal directions without
demanding temporal structures. We evaluate these models on synthetic and
real-world benchmarks and empirically observe performances competitive with
current state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we present two unique applications of
the proposed models for causal inference directly from pairs of genome
sequences belonging to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using a large number of sequences,
we show that our models capture directed causal information exchange between
sequence pairs, presenting novel opportunities for addressing key issues such
as contact-tracing, motif discovery, evolution of virulence and pathogenicity

is, it has over 200 years old roots in regression modeling and rule-based
machine learning, starting in the 1960s. Recently, many new IML methods have
been proposed, many of them model-agnostic, but also interpretation techniques
specific to deep learning and tree-based ensembles. IML methods either directly
analyze model components, study sensitivity to input perturbations, or analyze
local or global surrogate approximations of the ML model. The field approaches
a state of readiness and stability, with many methods not only proposed in
research, but also implemented in open-source software. But many important
challenges remain for IML, such as dealing with dependent features, causal
interpretation, and uncertainty estimation, which need to be resolved for its
successful application to scientific problems. A further challenge is a missing
rigorous definition of interpretability, which is accepted by the community. To
address the challenges and advance the field, we urge to recall our roots of
interpretable, data-driven modeling in statistics and (rule-based) ML, but also
to consider other areas such as sensitivity analysis, causal inference, and the
social sciences.

coupling, and forces laser beams to recover a quasi-single mode profile at the

spatiotemporal reshaping allows for improving the performances of nonlinear

experimentally demonstrate that the beam brightness increase, induced by
self-cleaning, enables two and three-photon imaging of biological samples with
high spatial resolution. Temporal pulse shortening accompanying spatial beam
clean-up enhances the output peak power, hence the efficiency of nonlinear

To handle the crucial issue, in this paper, we firstly propose a dynamic

reveals the subtle movement changes visually in an efficient way. Secondly, a
segmented movement-attending spatiotemporal network (SMA-STN) is proposed to
further unveil imperceptible small movement changes, which utilizes a
spatiotemporal movement-attending module (STMA) to capture long-distance
spatial relation for facial expression and weigh temporal segments. Besides, a
deviation enhancement loss (DE-Loss) is embedded in the SMA-STN to enhance the
robustness of SMA-STN to subtle movement changes in feature level. Extensive
experiments on three widely used benchmarks, i.e., CASME II, SAMM, and SHIC,

that $\varepsilon^+ \propto {y^+}^{-1}$ for streamwise homogeneous flows and a

consequence is that the usual eddy viscosity model for these terms cannot be

modulated by varying the concentration of Ru vacancies. We observe Hall effect
anomalies that closely resemble signatures of the THE, but a quantitative

of topological spin textures in numerous prior transport studies of quantum

each other in fixed coplanar Keplerian orbits. Moreover, their respective spin
axes are assumed to be perpendicular to the orbital plane, that is also a
common equatorial plane. The spin-spin model deals with the coupled rotational
dynamics of both ellipsoids. For a non-zero orbital eccentricity, it has the
structure of a non-autonomous system of coupled pendula. This model is a
natural extension of the classical spin-orbit problem for two extended bodies.
In addition, we consider dissipative tidal torques, that can trigger the
capture of the system into spin-orbit and spin-spin resonances. In this paper
we give some theoretical results for both the conservative model and the
dissipative one. The conservative model has a Hamiltonian structure. We use
properties of Hamiltonian systems to give some sufficient conditions in the
space of parameters of the model, that guarantee existence, uniqueness and
linear stability of an odd periodic solution. This solution represents a double
synchronous resonance in the conservative regime. Such solution can be
continued to the dissipative regime, where it becomes asymptotically stable. We
see asymptotic stability as a dynamical mechanism for the capture into the

magnetohydrodynamics simulations of a massive, turbulent, magnetised PSC,
coupled with a sophisticated deuteration astrochemical network. Although the

one freefall time, which marks the end of the simulations. Our fiducial model

ionization rates and significant heavy element depletion, we then study the

resultant pairs $(s,y)$. We then prove that this bound is achievable via an
\emph{$X$-invariant} randomization $p(y|x) = R(y)$ for $x,y\in\Xepsc$. However,
the utility measured by the mutual information $I(X;Y)$ is severely damaged in
imposing a strict upper bound $\eps$ on the abs-log-lift. To remedy this and
inspired by the probabilistic ($\eps$, $\delta$)-DP, we propose a relaxed
($\eps$, $\delta$)-log-lift framework. To achieve this relaxation, we introduce
a greedy algorithm which exempts some elements in $\Xepsc$ from randomization,
as long as their abs-log-lift is bounded by $\eps$ with probability $1-\delta$.
Numerical results demonstrate efficacy of this algorithm in achieving a better
privacy-utility tradeoff.

rapid development since the 1950s, mainly for engineering applications. More
recently, it has become a widely used method to improve process performance in
quantum technologies by means of highly efficient control of quantum dynamics.
This tutorial aims at providing an introduction to key concepts of optimal
control theory which is accessible to physicists and engineers working in
quantum control or in related fields. The different mathematical results are
introduced intuitively, before being rigorously stated. This tutorial describes
modern aspects of optimal control theory, with a particular focus on the
Pontryagin Maximum Principle, which is the main tool for determining open-loop
control laws without experimental feedback. The different steps to solve an
optimal control problem are discussed, before moving on to more advanced topics
such as the existence of optimal solutions or the definition of the different
types of extremals, namely normal, abnormal, and singular. The tutorial covers
various quantum control issues and describes their mathematical formulation
suitable for optimal control. The connection between the Pontryagin Maximum
Principle and gradient-based optimization algorithms used for high-dimensional
quantum systems is described. The optimal solution of different low-dimensional
quantum systems is presented in detail, illustrating how the mathematical tools
are applied in a practical way.

The investigation which is a combination of experimental observations and a
theoretical analysis of the ultrahigh optical response of semiconductor
nanowires, has been carried out with emphasis on Ge nanowires. Semiconductor
nanowire photodetectors show a signature of photogating where G_Pc rolls-off
with increasing illumination intensity. We show that surface band bending due
to depleted surface layers in nanowires induces a strong radial field (~ 108
V/m at the nanowire surface) which causes physical separation of photogenerated
electron-hole pairs. This was established quantitatively through a
self-consistent theoretical model based on coupled Schrodinger and Poisson
Equations. It shows that carrier separation slows down the surface
recombination velocity to a low value (< 1 cm/s) thus reducing the carrier
recombination rate and extending the recombination lifetime by few orders of
magnitude. An important outcome of the model is the prediction of G_Pc ~ 106 in
a single Ge nanowire (with diameter 60 nm), which matches well with our
experimental observation. The model also shows an inverse dependence of G_Pc on
the diameter that has been observed experimentally. Though carried out in
context of Ge nanowires, the physical model developed has general applicability
in other semiconductor nanowires as well.

not exist by itself alone on lattice. The obstruction to such a lattice

anomalous 1d system with a 2d bulk, which is in a topologically non-trivial
state, as the boundary of the latter. In this paper, we propose a 1+1D chiral
fermion model on 1d spatial lattice, {standing alone} -- without being
associated with a 2d bulk -- with a simple {non-Hermitian} hopping Hamiltonian.
We demonstrate, using various methods, that the model possesses the same chiral
anomaly and gravitational anomaly as in continuum theory. Furthermore, with
appropriate parameters, the low energy effective theory of the model remains a
field theory for unitary chiral fermions. The essential reason for the success
is that the usual ""doubled"" fermion mode with opposite chirality is rapidly
damped out because of non-Hermicity of the Hamiltonian.

scheme. We find that the net fractional well-defined chiral corrections with
respect to the leading order Born cross section can be as large as $10\%$

Experiment (MUSE) kinematics. We show {\it via} our model-independent treatment
of the low-energy lepton-proton kinematics, that the largest theoretical
uncertainty is due to the recent different published values of the proton's rms
radius while, e.g., the next higher order hadronic chiral terms are expected to
give rather nominal errors. For the radiative corrections we demonstrate a
systematic order by order cancellation of all infrared singularities and
present our finite ultraviolet regularization results. We find that the
radiative corrections for muon-proton scattering is of the order of $2\%$,
whereas for electron scattering the radiative corrections could be as large as
$25\%$. We attribute such a contrasting result partially to the fact that in
muon scattering the leading radiative order correction goes through zero in
some intermediate low-momentum transfer region, leaving the sub-leading
radiative chiral order effects to play a dominant role in this particular
kinematic region. For the low-energy MUSE experiment, the often neglected

forces of gravity, gas drag and radiation pressure. Our main focus is on the
optically thin regions of dusty disc, where the dust is exposed to the most
extreme heating conditions and dynamical perturbations: the surface of
optically thick disc and the inner dust sublimation zone. We utilise results
from two numerically strenuous fields of research. The first is the
quasi-stationary solutions on gas velocity and density distributions from
mangetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of accretion discs. This is critical
for implementing a more realistic gas drag impact on dust movements. The second
is the optical depth structure from a high-resolution dust radiation transfer.
This step is critical for a better understanding of dust distribution within
the disc. We describe a numerical method that incorporates these solutions into
the dust dynamics equations. We use this to integrate dust trajectories under
different disc wind models and show how grains end up trapped in flows that
range from simple accretion onto the star to outflows into outer disc regions.
We demonstrate how the radiation pressure force plays one of the key roles in
this process and cannot be ignored. It erodes the dusty disc surface, reduces
its height, resists dust accretion onto the star, and helps the disc wind in
pushing grains outwards. The changes in grain size and porosity significantly
affect the results, with smaller and porous grains being influenced more
strongly by the disc wind and radiation pressure.

models need to adapt to distributional changes, which are known as concept
drift. The timely and robust identification of concept drift can be difficult,
as we never have access to the true distribution of streaming data. In this
work, we propose a novel framework for the detection of real concept drift,
called ERICS. By treating the parameters of a predictive model as random
variables, we show that concept drift corresponds to a change in the
distribution of optimal parameters. To this end, we adopt common measures from
information theory. The proposed framework is completely model-agnostic. By
choosing an appropriate base model, ERICS is also capable to detect concept
drift at the input level, which is a significant advantage over existing
approaches. An evaluation on several synthetic and real-world data sets
suggests that the proposed framework identifies concept drift more effectively
and precisely than various existing works.

scientific models by quantifying the impact of model parameters on the
predicted effects. However, there has been little formal investigation of
causation in this framework, despite causal models being a fundamental part of
science and explanation. Here we introduce causal geometry, which formalizes
not only how outcomes are impacted by parameters, but also how the parameters
of a model can be intervened upon. Therefore we introduce a geometric version
of ""effective information"" -- a known measure of the informativeness of a
causal relationship. We show that it is given by the matching between the space
of effects and the space of interventions, in the form of their geometric
congruence. Therefore, given a fixed intervention capability, an effective
causal model is one that matches those interventions. This is a consequence of
""causal emergence,"" wherein macroscopic causal relationships may carry more
information than ""fundamental"" microscopic ones. We thus argue that a
coarse-grained model may, paradoxically, be more informative than the
microscopic one, especially when it better matches the scale of accessible
interventions -- as we illustrate on toy examples.

oesophagus. Its low contrast on CT and the oblong shape renders motion
estimation difficult. We tackle this issue by modern algorithms to measure the
oesophageal motion voxel-wise and to estimate motion related dosimetric impact.
Oesophageal motion was measured using deformable image registration and 4DCT of
11 internal and 5 public datasets. Current clinical practice of contouring the
organ on 3DCT was compared to timely resolved 4DCT contours. The dosimetric
impact of the motion was estimated by analysing the trajectory of each voxel in
the 4D dose distribution. Finally an organ motion model was built, allowing for
easier patient-wise comparisons. Motion analysis showed mean absolute maximal
motion amplitudes of 4.55 +/- 1.81 mm left-right, 5.29 +/- 2.67 mm
anterior-posterior and 10.78 +/- 5.30 mm superior-inferior. Motion between the
cohorts differed significantly. In around 50 % of the cases the dosimetric
passing criteria was violated. Contours created on 3DCT did not cover 14 % of
the organ for 50 % of the respiratory cycle and the 3D contour is around 38 %
smaller than the union of all 4D contours. The motion model revealed that the
maximal motion is not limited to the lower part of the organ. Our results
showed motion amplitudes higher than most reported values in the literature and
that motion is very heterogeneous across patients. Therefore, individual motion
information should be considered in contouring and planning.

Consequently, they have only a small number of applications, such as
location-based services and document processing. In this paper, we propose a
couple of mechanisms providing extended DP with a different metric: angular
distance (or cosine distance). Our mechanisms are based on locality sensitive
hashing (LSH), which can be applied to the angular distance and work well for
personal data in a high-dimensional space. We theoretically analyze the privacy
properties of our mechanisms, and prove extended DP for input data by taking
into account that LSH preserves the original metric only approximately. We
apply our mechanisms to friend matching based on high-dimensional personal data
with angular distance in the local model, and evaluate our mechanisms using two
real datasets. We show that LDP requires a very large privacy budget and that
RAPPOR does not work in this application. Then we show that our mechanisms
enable friend matching with high utility and rigorous privacy guarantees based

in two long period pulsars, PSR B0525+21 and B2046-16 at frequencies below 1

studies did not detect off-pulse emission from these pulsars at higher radio
frequencies (> 1 GHz). We have carefully inspected the analysis scheme used in

which resulted in leakage of signal from the on-pulse to the off-pulse region.

towards self-similarity is analyzed using an analytical solution in a power-law

self-similarity after a number of dynamical times even if the inital conditions
are far from self-similarity. The power-law model is extended by using
perturbative analysis. The perturbative analysis shows that once the power-law

demonstrates the mechanism behind the convergence towards auto-similarity. The
cold solutions are compatible with a broad range of self-similar solutions. As

components of the $^1\Sigma^{-}$ and $^1\!\Delta$ states. Dissociation into CO
and S fragments was observed through time-delayed strong-field ionisation and
imaging of the kinetic energy of the resulting CO$^+$ and S$^+$ fragments by
intense $790$ nm laser pulses. Surprisingly, fast oscillations with a period of
$\sim100$ fs were observed in the S$^+$ channel of the UV dissociation. Based
on wavepacket-dynamics simulations coupled with a simple
electrostatic-interaction model, these oscillations do not correspond to the
known highly-excited rotational motion of the leaving CO$(X\,^1\Sigma^+,J\gg0)$
fragments, which has a timescale of $\sim140$ fs. Instead, we suggest to assign
the observed oscillations to the excitation of vibrational wavepackets in the
$2\,^3\!A''$ or $2\,^1\!A''$ states of the molecule that predissociate to form
S$(^3\!P_{J})$ photoproducts.

explicit breaking of $SU(2)$ symmetry by introduction of mass imbalance in a
variant of Hubbard model, known as the ionic Hubbard model in the presence of
frustration at half-filling on a square lattice. The ionic Hubbard model has in
addition to hopping($\sim t$) and onsite coulomb repulsion ($\sim U$), a
staggered ionic potential ($\sim \Delta$) which breaks translational symmetry
of the underlying lattice. In the low to intermediate ranges of $U$ and
$\Delta$, we use unrestricted Hartree-Fock theory to construct the phase
diagram in the $U-\Delta$ plane for a fixed mass imbalance($\sim\eta$). Where
as in the limit where both $U,\Delta$ are comparable and much larger than the
first $(\sim t_{\sigma})$ and second $(\sim t_{\sigma}')$ neighbor hopping
amplitudes , we employ the technique of generalized Gutzwiller approximation
and subsequently use renormalized mean field theory to construct the phase
diagram for varying values of hopping asymmetry. In both cases, starting from a
correlated band insulator with weak antiferromagnetic spin density wave order,
if we tune $U/\Delta$, we observe the opening of novel magnetically ordered
metallic phases such as spin imbalanced ferromagnetic metal, ferrimagnetic
metal and antiferromagnetic half metal. We also study singlet superconductivity
in the d-wave and extended s-wave channels in the strong coupling limit of this

direct and indirect methods: an enhanced illumination-invariant Lucas-Kanade

deformable map estimation, and bag-of-words based on feature descriptors for
camera relocation. Dynamic objects are detected and segmented-out using a CNN

the mean curvature motion model is the regularization of the first variation of
the varifold via convolution with kernels with small stencil. Consistency with
the evolution velocity for a smooth surface is proven if a sufficiently small
stencil and a regular sampling are taking into account. Furthermore, an
implicit and a semiimplicit time discretization are derived. The implicit
scheme comes with discrete barrier properties known for the smooth, continuous

It is shown that the proposed method is robust with respect to noise and

we propose to synthesize visual features for unseen classes, so that the model

major challenge becomes, how to accurately synthesize unseen objects merely
using their class semantics? Towards this ambitious goal, we propose a novel
generative model that uses class-semantics to not only generate the features
but also to discriminatively separate them. Further, using a unified model, we
ensure the synthesized features have high diversity that represents the
intra-class differences and variable localization precision in the detected

  Things Networks",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Privacy protection in electronic healthcare applications is an important
consideration due to the sensitive nature of personal health data. Internet of
Health Things (IoHT) networks have privacy requirements within a healthcare
setting. However, these networks have unique challenges and security
requirements (integrity, authentication, privacy and availability) must also be
balanced with the need to maintain efficiency in order to conserve battery
power, which can be a significant limitation in IoHT devices and networks. Data
are usually transferred without undergoing filtering or optimization, and this
traffic can overload sensors and cause rapid battery consumption when
interacting with IoHT networks. This consequently poses restrictions on the
practical implementation of these devices. As a solution to address the issues,
this paper proposes a privacy-preserving two-tier data inference framework,
this can conserve battery consumption by reducing the data size required to
transmit through inferring the sensed data and can also protect the sensitive
data from leakage to adversaries. Results from experimental evaluations on
privacy show the validity of the proposed scheme as well as significant data
savings without compromising the accuracy of the data transmission, which
contributes to energy efficiency of IoHT sensor devices.

time series often assume linear relationships. Hence, they may fail in
realistic settings that contain nonlinear relations between the variables. We
propose Neural Additive Vector Autoregression (NAVAR) models, a neural approach
to causal structure learning that can discover nonlinear relationships. We
train deep neural networks that extract the (additive) Granger causal
influences from the time evolution in multi-variate time series. The method
achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmark data sets for causal
discovery, while providing clear interpretations of the mapped causal

of the most informative features. In this paper, we propose an innovative
framework for unsupervised feature selection, called fractal autoencoders
(FAE). It trains a neural network to pinpoint informative features for global
exploring of representability and for local excavating of diversity.
Architecturally, FAE extends autoencoders by adding a one-to-one scoring layer
and a small sub-neural network for feature selection in an unsupervised
fashion. With such a concise architecture, FAE achieves state-of-the-art
performances; extensive experimental results on fourteen datasets, including
very high-dimensional data, have demonstrated the superiority of FAE over
existing contemporary methods for unsupervised feature selection. In
particular, FAE exhibits substantial advantages on gene expression data
exploration, reducing measurement cost by about $15$\% over the widely used
L1000 landmark genes. Further, we show that the FAE framework is easily
extensible with an application.

optical and near-infrared is key to characterizing sub-stellar objects and
developing potential diagnostics for determining properties of their
atmospheres. Differential scattering from a population of aligned,
non-spherical dust grains is a potential source of polarization that could be
used to determine geometric properties of the dust clouds. This paper addresses
the problem of the spheroidal growth of dust grains in electrically activated
sub-stellar atmospheres. It presents the novel application of a mechanism
whereby non-spherical, elongated dust grains can be grown via plasma deposition
as a consequence of the surface electric field effects of charged dust grains.
We numerically solve the differential equations governing the spheroidal growth
of charged dust grains via plasma deposition as a result of surface electric
field effects in order to determine how the dust eccentricity and the dust
particle eccentricity distribution function evolve with time. From these
results, we determine the effect of spheroidal dust on the observed linear
polarization. Numerical solutions show that $e\approx 0.94$ defines a watershed
eccentricity, where the eccentricity of grains with an initial eccentricity
less than (greater than) this value decreases (increases) and spherical
(spheroidal) growth occurs. This produces a characteristic bimodal eccentricity
distribution function yielding a fractional change in the observed linear
polarization of up to $\approx0.1$ corresponding to dust grains of maximal
eccentricity at wavelengths of $\approx1 \mu$m, consistent with the near
infrared observational window. The results presented here are relevant to the
growth of non-spherical, irregularly shaped dust grains of general geometry
where non-uniform surface electric field effects of charged dust grains are
significant.

role for the advanced scientific missions. This thesis makes a series of
studies on the typical error sources associated with the positioning and
calibration processes, such as the centroiding algorithm, detector noise,
motion, focal length drift, variation of the center wavelength of stellar
spectrum, the model error, etc., some works of which are listed as follows:
IWCOG algorithm is studied for the characteristics of both the accuracy and

approximate optimum property for signal with Possion noise and the optimum
feature in case of Gaussian noise. In order to enhance the dynamic performance,
the generallized dynamic compensation formula is derived to compensate out the
error from motion. decoupling of three technical indicators including dynamic
performance, pointing accuracy and attitude output rate. To solve the problems
exhibited in the in-orbit correction procedure, a brilliant idea, known as the
CRLB constraint method, is presented to minimize some small error sources. To
fulfill this goal, the full CRLB constaint formulas are derived to build a
budget to limit the in-flight parameters. Using this method the overall error
are obtained, which in turn results in three significant inferences. The
attitude determination process is further optimized, by giving different
weights to each star according to their magnitudes and the position over
different star field, the QUEST algorithm is thus upgraded. The results show
that this method can improve the attitude measurement accuracy statistically by
10-20%. The theory and deductions can be directly applied to various types of
star trackers, whether it is a super-high accuracy one, or a high dynamic one.

difference between the jets, and of the dijet invariant mass. A fiducial region
for the measurement is defined by requiring that the two jets originating from
the two $b$ or $c$ quarks are emitted with transverse momentum greater than 20
GeV$/c$, pseudorapidity in the range $2.2 < \eta < 4.2$, and with a difference
in the azimuthal angle between the two jets greater than 1.5. The integrated $b

$c \bar{c}$-dijet cross-section is measured to be $73 \pm 16$ nb. The ratio
between $c \bar{c}$- and $b \bar{b}$-dijet cross-sections is also measured and

readily available while labeled examples are limited. There has been
substantial interest in semi-supervised learning (SSL) which aims to leverage
unlabeled data to improve estimation or prediction. However, current SSL
literature focuses primarily on settings where labeled data is selected
randomly from the population of interest. Non-random sampling, while posing
additional analytical challenges, is highly applicable to many real world
problems. Moreover, no SSL methods currently exist for estimating the
prediction performance of a fitted model under non-random sampling. In this
paper, we propose a two-step SSL procedure for evaluating a prediction rule
derived from a working binary regression model based on the Brier score and
overall misclassification rate under stratified sampling. In step I, we impute
the missing labels via weighted regression with nonlinear basis functions to
account for nonrandom sampling and to improve efficiency. In step II, we
augment the initial imputations to ensure the consistency of the resulting
estimators regardless of the specification of the prediction model or the
imputation model. The final estimator is then obtained with the augmented
imputations. We provide asymptotic theory and numerical studies illustrating
that our proposals outperform their supervised counterparts in terms of
efficiency gain. Our methods are motivated by electronic health records (EHR)
research and validated with a real data analysis of an EHR-based study of
diabetic neuropathy.

result, the $2$-ranks of the (0,1)-incidence matrices of all
$3$-$(q+1,k,\lambda)$ designs that are invariant under

present two infinite families of cyclic codes over $\mathrm{GF}(2^m)$ such that
the set of the supports of all codewords of any fixed nonzero weight is
invariant under $\mathrm{PGL}_2(\mathrm{GF}(2^m))$, therefore, the codewords of
any nonzero weight support a 3-design. A code from the first family has
parameters $[q+1,q-3,4]_q$, where $q=2^m$, and $m\ge 4$ is even. The exact
number of the codewords of minimum weight is determined, and the codewords of
minimum weight support a 3-$(q+1,4,2)$ design. A code from the second family

codewords support a 3-$(q +1,q-4,(q-4)(q-5)(q-6)/60)$ design, whose
complementary 3-$(q +1, 5, 1)$ design is isomorphic to the Witt spherical
geometry with these parameters. A lower bound on the dimension of a linear code
over $\mathrm{GF}(q)$ that can support a 3-$(q +1,q-4,(q-4)(q-5)(q-6)/60)$

finite-state agents interact in pairs. The cut-off problem asks if there exists
a number $B$ such that all initial configurations of the protocol with at least
$B$ agents in a given initial state can reach a final configuration with all
agents in a given final state. In a recent paper (Horn and Sangnier, CONCUR

least as hard as the Petri net reachability problem) for protocols with a
leader, and in EXPSPACE for leaderless protocols. Further, for the special
class of symmetric protocols they reduce these bounds to PSPACE and NP,
respectively. The problem of lowering these upper bounds or finding matching
lower bounds was left open. We show that the cut-off problem is P-complete for
leaderless protocols and in NC for leaderless symmetric protocols. Further, we
also consider a variant of the cut-off problem suggested in (Horn and Sangnier,
CONCUR 2020), which we call the bounded-loss cut-off problem and prove that
this problem is P-complete for leaderless protocols and NL-complete for
leaderless symmetric protocols. Finally, by reusing some of the techniques
applied for the analysis of leaderless protocols, we show that the cut-off
problem for symmetric protocols with a leader is NP-complete, thereby improving
upon all the elementary upper bounds of (Horn and Sangnier, CONCUR 2020).

minimizes the squared Euclidean norm of the weight vector subject to a set of
relaxed linear inequality constraints. The magnitude of relaxation, controlled
by a tuning parameter, balances the bias and variance. When the
variance-covariance (VC) matrix of the individual forecast errors or financial
assets exhibits latent group structures -- a block equicorrelation matrix plus
a VC for idiosyncratic noises, the solution to L2-relaxation delivers roughly
equal within-group weights. Optimality of the new method is established under
the asymptotic framework when the number of the cross-sectional units $N$
potentially grows much faster than the time dimension $T$. Excellent finite

temporal information is critical to address this issue yet not fully considered
in the existing works. In this paper, we visit the video-oriented face
alignment problem in two perspectives: detection accuracy prefers lower error
for a single frame, and detection consistency forces better stability between
adjacent frames. On this basis, we propose a Jitter loss function that
leverages temporal information to suppress inaccurate as well as jittered
landmarks. The Jitter loss is involved in a novel framework with a fine-tuning
ConvLSTM structure over a backbone replaceable network. We further demonstrate
that accurate and stable landmarks are associated with different regions with
overlaps in a canonical coordinate, based on which the proposed Jitter loss
facilitates the optimization process during training. The proposed framework
achieves at least 40% improvement on stability evaluation metrics while
enhancing detection accuracy versus state-of-the-art methods. Generally, it can
swiftly convert a landmark detector for facial images to a better-performing
one for videos without retraining the entire model.

  In this paper, we present Hector, a novel web application framework that

improving user experience with lower latencies while generating less costs for

obtained by contrastive learning. While existing approaches implicitly induce a
degree of invariance as representations are learned, we look to more directly
enforce invariance in the encoding process. To this end, we first introduce a
training objective for contrastive learning that uses a novel regularizer to
control how the representation changes under transformation. We show that
representations trained with this objective perform better on downstream tasks
and are more robust to the introduction of nuisance transformations at test
time. Second, we propose a change to how test time representations are
generated by introducing a feature averaging approach that combines encodings
from multiple transformations of the original input, finding that this leads to
across the board performance gains. Finally, we introduce the novel Spirograph
dataset to explore our ideas in the context of a differentiable generative
process with multiple downstream tasks, showing that our techniques for
learning invariance are highly beneficial.

  always welcome!",,,,"math.AT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The primary goal of this paper is to study Spanier-Whitehead duality in the
$K(n)$-local category. One of the key players in the $K(n)$-local category is
the Lubin-Tate spectrum $E_n$, whose homotopy groups classify deformations of a
formal group law of height $n$, in the implicit characteristic $p$. It is known
that $E_n$ is self-dual up to a shift; however, that does not fully take into
account the action of the Morava stabilizer group $\mathbb{G}_n$, or even its
subgroup of automorphisms of the formal group in question. In this paper we
find that the $\mathbb{G}_n$-equivariant dual of $E_n$ is in fact $E_n$ twisted
by a sphere with a non-trivial (when $n>1$) action by $\mathbb{G}_n$. This
sphere is a dualizing module for the group $\mathbb{G}_n$, and we construct and
study such an object $I_{\mathcal{G}}$ for any compact $p$-adic analytic group
$\mathcal{G}$. If we restrict the action of $\mathcal{G}$ on $I_{\mathcal{G}}$
to certain type of small subgroups, we identify $I_{\mathcal{G}}$ with a
specific representation sphere coming from the Lie algebra of $\mathcal{G}$.
This is done by a classification of $p$-complete sphere spectra with an action
by an elementary abelian $p$-group in terms of characteristic classes, and then
a specific comparison of the characteristic classes in question. The setup
makes the theory quite accessible for computations, as we demonstrate in the
later sections of this paper, determining the $K(n)$-local Spanier-Whitehead
duals of $E_n^{hH}$ for select choices of $p$ and $n$ and finite subgroups $H$
of $\mathbb{G}_n$.

learning techniques to build state-of-the-art code search models. Particularly,
they leverage deep neural networks to embed codes and queries into a unified

layer-wise attention to capture the valuable code's intrinsic structural logic.
To further increase the learning efficiency of COSEA, we propose a variant of
contrastive loss for training the code search model, where the ground-truth

implemented a prototype of COSEA. Extensive experiments over existing public

provide complementary information and we hypothesize that combining them will
improve the prediction accuracy. In practice, not all patients have all these

multi-path multi-modal missing network (M3Net), to integrate the multi-modal
data (i.e., CDEs, biomarker and CT image) considering missing modality with
multiple paths neural network. Each path learns discriminative features of one
modality, and different modalities are fused in a second stage for an
integrated prediction. The network can be trained end-to-end with both medical
image features and CDEs/biomarkers, or make a prediction with single modality.
We evaluate M3Net with datasets including three sites from the Consortium for
Molecular and Cellular Characterization of Screen-Detected Lesions (MCL)
project. Our method is cross validated within a cohort of 1291 subjects (383
subjects with complete CDEs/biomarkers and CT images), and externally validated
with a cohort of 99 subjects (99 with complete CDEs/biomarkers and CT images).
Both cross-validation and external-validation results show that combining
multiple modality significantly improves the predicting performance of single
modality. The results suggest that integrating subjects with missing either
CDEs/biomarker or CT imaging features can contribute to the discriminatory
power of our model (p < 0.05, bootstrap two-tailed test). In summary, the
proposed M3Net framework provides an effective way to integrate image and
non-image data in the context of missing information.

essential for cardiac intervention. Currently, the state-of-the-art
segmentation algorithms are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs),
which achieved remarkable performances in a standard Cartesian volumetric data.
Nevertheless, these approaches suffer the challenges of low efficiency and GPU
unfriendly image size. Therefore, such difficulties and expensive hardware
requirements become a bottleneck to build accurate and efficient segmentation
models for real clinical application. In this paper, we propose a novel Frustum
ultrasound based catheter segmentation method. Specifically, Frustum ultrasound
is a polar coordinate based image, which includes same information of standard
Cartesian image but has much smaller size, which overcomes the bottleneck of
efficiency than conventional Cartesian images. Nevertheless, the irregular and
deformed Frustum images lead to more efforts for accurate voxel-level
annotation. To address this limitation, a weakly supervised learning framework
is proposed, which only needs 3D bounding box annotations overlaying the
region-of-interest to training the CNNs. Although the bounding box annotation
includes noise and inaccurate annotation to mislead to model, it is addressed
by the proposed pseudo label generated scheme. The labels of training voxels
are generated by incorporating class activation maps with line filtering, which
is iteratively updated during the training. Our experimental results show the
proposed method achieved the state-of-the-art performance with an efficiency of
0.25 second per volume. More crucially, the Frustum image segmentation provides
a much faster and cheaper solution for segmentation in 3D US image, which meet
the demands of clinical applications.

problems is proposed where the fluid field is spatially discretized using
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and the structural field using the finite
element method (FEM). As compared to fully mesh- or grid-based FSI frameworks,
due to the Lagrangian nature of SPH this framework can be easily extended to
account for more complex fluids consisting of multiple phases and dynamic phase
transitions. Moreover, this approach facilitates the handling of large
deformations of the fluid domain respectively the fluid-structure interface
without additional methodological and computational efforts. In particular, to
achieve an accurate representation of interaction forces between fluid
particles and structural elements also for strongly curved interface
geometries, the novel sliding boundary particle approach is proposed to ensure
full support of SPH particles close to the interface. The coupling of the fluid
and the structural field is based on a Dirichlet-Neumann partitioned approach,
where the fluid field is the Dirichlet partition with prescribed interface
displacements and the structural field is the Neumann partition subject to
interface forces. To overcome instabilities inherent to weakly coupled schemes
an iterative fixed-point coupling scheme is employed. Several numerical
examples in form of well-known benchmark tests are considered to validate the
accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed formulation. Finally, the
filling process of a highly flexible thin-walled balloon-like container is
studied, representing a model problem close to potential application scenarios

further line of sight or better ride quality. Although many DLC decision-making
models have been studied in traffic engineering and autonomous driving, the
impact of human factors, which is an integral part of current and future
traffic flow, is largely ignored in the existing literature. In autonomous
driving, the ignorance of human factors of surrounding vehicles will lead to
poor interaction between the ego vehicle and the surrounding vehicles, thus, a
high risk of accidents. The human factors are also a crucial part to simulate a
human-like traffic flow in the traffic engineering area. In this paper, we
integrate the human factors that are represented by driving styles to design a
new DLC decision-making model. Specifically, our proposed model takes not only
the contextual traffic information but also the driving styles of surrounding
vehicles into consideration and makes lane-change/keep decisions. Moreover, the
model can imitate human drivers' decision-making maneuvers to the greatest
extent by learning the driving style of the ego vehicle. Our evaluation results
show that the proposed model almost follows the human decision-making
maneuvers, which can achieve 98.66% prediction accuracy with respect to human
drivers' decisions against the ground truth. Besides, the lane-change impact
analysis results demonstrate that our model even performs better than human

critical examples to label. Typically, the active learning strategy is
contingent on the classification model. For instance, uncertainty sampling
depends on poorly calibrated model confidence scores. In the cold-start
setting, active learning is impractical because of model instability and data
scarcity. Fortunately, modern NLP provides an additional source of information:
pre-trained language models. The pre-training loss can find examples that
surprise the model and should be labeled for efficient fine-tuning. Therefore,
we treat the language modeling loss as a proxy for classification uncertainty.
With BERT, we develop a simple strategy based on the masked language modeling
loss that minimizes labeling costs for text classification. Compared to other
baselines, our approach reaches higher accuracy within less sampling iterations

\emph{value generalization among policies}. We formally analyze the value
generalization under Generalized Policy Iteration (GPI). From theoretical and
empirical lens, we show that generalized value estimates offered by PeVFA may
have lower initial approximation error to true values of successive policies,
which is expected to improve consecutive value approximation during GPI. Based
on above clues, we introduce a new form of GPI with PeVFA which leverages the
value generalization along policy improvement path. Moreover, we propose a
representation learning framework for RL policy, providing several approaches
to learn effective policy embeddings from policy network parameters or
state-action pairs. In our experiments, we evaluate the efficacy of value
generalization offered by PeVFA and policy representation learning in several
OpenAI Gym continuous control tasks. For a representative instance of algorithm
implementation, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) re-implemented under the

which we cannot existentially or universally define the ring of integers
$\mathcal{O}_K$. A complete answer to this question would have important
consequences. For example, the existence of an existential definition of
$\mathbb{Z}$ in $\mathbb{Q}$ would imply that Hilbert's Tenth Problem for
$\mathbb{Q}$ is undecidable, resolving one of the biggest open problems in the
area. However, a conjecture of Mazur implies that the integers are not
existentially definable in the rationals. Although proving that an existential
definition of $\mathbb{Z}$ in $\mathbb{Q}$ does not exist appears to be out of
reach right now, we show that when we consider all algebraic extensions of
$\mathbb{Q}$, this is the generally expected outcome. Namely, we prove that in
most algebraic extensions of the rationals, the ring of integers is not
existentially definable. To make this precise, we view the set of algebraic
extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$ as a topological space homeomorphic to Cantor space.
In this light, the set of fields which have an existentially definable ring of
integers is a meager set, i.e. is very small. On the other hand, by work of
Koenigsmann and Park, it is possible to give a universal definition of the ring
of integers in finite extensions of the rationals, i.e. in number fields.

algorithms to support decisions with a critical impact on people's lives such
as job hiring, child maltreatment, disease diagnosis, loan granting, etc.
Several notions of fairness have been defined and examined in the past decade,
such as statistical parity and equalized odds. The most recent fairness
notions, however, are causal-based and reflect the now widely accepted idea
that using causality is necessary to appropriately address the problem of
fairness. This paper examines an exhaustive list of causal-based fairness
notions and study their applicability in real-world scenarios. As the majority
of causal-based fairness notions are defined in terms of non-observable
quantities (e.g., interventions and counterfactuals), their deployment in
practice requires to compute or estimate those quantities using observational
data. This paper offers a comprehensive report of the different approaches to
infer causal quantities from observational data including identifiability
(Pearl's SCM framework) and estimation (potential outcome framework). The main
contributions of this survey paper are (1) a guideline to help selecting a
suitable fairness notion given a specific real-world scenario, and (2) a
ranking of the fairness notions according to Pearl's causation ladder
indicating how difficult it is to deploy each notion in practice.

associated phase transition in the epitaxial films. However, the systematic
study of intrinsic characters and their strain dependency in transition-metal
nitrides remains challenging due to the difficulty in fabricating the
stoichiometric and high-quality films. Here we report the observation of
electronic state transition in highly crystalline antiferromagnetic CrN films
with strain and reduced dimensionality. Shrinking the film thickness to a
critical value of ~ 30 unit cells, a profound conductivity reduction
accompanied by unexpected volume expansion is observed in CrN films. The
electrical conductivity is observed surprisingly when the CrN layer as thin as
single unit cell thick, which is far below the critical thickness of most
metallic films. We found that the metallicity of an ultrathin CrN film recovers
from an insulating behavior upon the removal of as-grown strain by fabrication
of first-ever freestanding nitride films. Both first-principles calculations
and linear dichroism measurements reveal that the strain-mediated orbital
splitting effectively customizes the relatively small bandgap at the Fermi
level, leading to exotic phase transition in CrN. The ability to achieve highly
conductive nitride ultrathin films by harness strain-controlling over competing
phases can be used for utilizing their exceptional characteristics.

learning strategies to exploit the observed source-domain labeled data. The

introduced to learn the target-specific feature space, and we design a novel

conventional UDA method, and both teacher and student networks compete to
provide target pseudo-labels to constrain every target sample's training in

label noise (CCN) robust scheme for binary classification. It first generates a
set of correctly labelled data points from noisy labelled data and 0.1% or 1%
clean labels such that the generated and true (clean) labelled data
distributions are close; generated labelled data is used to learn a good
classifier. The mode collapse problem while generating correct feature-label
pairs and the problem of skewed feature-label dimension ratio ($\sim$ 784:1)
are avoided by using Wasserstein GAN and a simple data representation change.
Another WGAN with information-theoretic flavour on top of the new
representation is also proposed. The major advantage of both schemes is their
significant improvement over the existing ones in presence of very high CCN
rates, without either estimating or cross-validating over the noise rates. We
proved that KL divergence between clean and noisy distribution increases w.r.t.
noise rates in symmetric label noise model; can be extended to high CCN rates.
This implies that our schemes perform well due to the adversarial nature of
GANs. Further, use of generative approach (learning clean joint distribution)
while handling noise enables our schemes to perform better than discriminative
approaches like GLC, LDMI and GCE; even when the classes are highly imbalanced.
Using Friedman F test and Nemenyi posthoc test, we showed that on high

complementary cosmological information to what is accessible with two-point
statistics, like the power spectrum. While the standard way of measuring the
bispectrum involves estimating a bispectrum value in a large number of Fourier
triangle bins, the compressed modal bispectrum approximates the bispectrum as a
linear combination of basis functions and estimates the expansion coefficients
on the chosen basis. In this work, we compare the two estimators by using
parallel pipelines to analyze the real-space halo bispectrum measured in a
suite of $N$-body simulations corresponding to a total volume of $\sim 1{,}000
\,h^{-3}\,{\rm Gpc}^3$, with covariance matrices estimated from 10,000 mock
halo catalogs. We find that the modal bispectrum yields constraints that are
consistent and competitive with the standard bispectrum analysis: for the halo
bias and shot noise parameters within the tree-level halo bispectrum model up
to $k_{\rm max} \approx 0.06 \, (0.10) \,h\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$, only 6 (10) modal
expansion coefficients are necessary to obtain constraints equivalent to the
standard bispectrum estimator using $\sim$ 20 to 1,600 triangle bins, depending
on the bin width. For this work, we have implemented a modal estimator pipeline
using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations for the first time, and we discuss
in detail how the parameter posteriors and modal expansion are robust to, or
sensitive to, several user settings within the modal bispectrum pipeline. The
combination of the highly efficient compression that is achieved and the large

bispectrum constraints depend on the number of mocks that are used to estimate
covariance matrices and the functional form of the likelihood.

methods have been proposed in the literature. In this study, we have developed
an ensemble Deep Convolutional Neural Network-based classifier to classify
wound images including surgical, diabetic, and venous ulcers, into
multi-classes. The output classification scores of two classifiers (patch-wise
and image-wise) are fed into a Multi-Layer Perceptron to provide a superior
classification performance. A 5-fold cross-validation approach is used to
evaluate the proposed method. We obtained maximum and average classification
accuracy values of 96.4% and 94.28% for binary and 91.9\% and 87.7\% for
3-class classification problems. The results show that our proposed method can

We propose a novel, integrative, and neural network-based literature-based
discovery (LBD) approach to identify drug candidates from both PubMed and
COVID-19-focused research literature. Our approach relies on semantic triples
extracted using SemRep (via SemMedDB). We identified an informative subset of
semantic triples using filtering rules and an accuracy classifier developed on
a BERT variant, and used this subset to construct a knowledge graph. Five SOTA,
neural knowledge graph completion algorithms were used to predict drug
repurposing candidates. The models were trained and assessed using a time
slicing approach and the predicted drugs were compared with a list of drugs
reported in the literature and evaluated in clinical trials. These models were
complemented by a discovery pattern-based approach. Results: Accuracy
classifier based on PubMedBERT achieved the best performance (F1= 0.854) in
classifying semantic predications. Among five knowledge graph completion
models, TransE outperformed others (MR = 0.923, Hits@1=0.417). Some known drugs
linked to COVID-19 in the literature were identified, as well as some candidate
drugs that have not yet been studied. Discovery patterns enabled generation of
plausible hypotheses regarding the relationships between the candidate drugs
and COVID-19. Among them, five highly ranked and novel drugs (paclitaxel, SB
203580, alpha 2-antiplasmin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and butylated

Conclusion: We show that an LBD approach can be feasible for discovering drug
candidates for COVID-19, and for generating mechanistic explanations. Our
approach can be generalized to other diseases as well as to other clinical

stochastically perturbed version. The deterministic attractor is well known to
be ""strange"" but it is frozen in time. When driven by multiplicative noise, the
Lorenz model's random attractor (LORA) evolves in time. Algebraic topology
sheds light on the most striking effects involved in such an evolution. In
order to examine the topological structure of the snapshots that approximate
LORA, we use Branched Manifold Analysis through Homologies (BraMAH) -- a
technique originally introduced to characterize the topological structure of
deterministically chaotic flows -- which is being extended herein to nonlinear
noise-driven systems. The analysis is performed for a fixed realization of the
driving noise at different time instants in time. The results suggest that
LORA's evolution includes sharp transitions that appear as topological tipping
points.

and we study their correlation functions when the initial data is sampled with
respect to the Gibbs measure. Such correlation functions display rapid
oscillations that travel through the chain. We show that the correlation
functions always have two fastest peaks which move in opposite directions and
decay at rate $t^{-\frac{1}{3}}$ for position and momentum correlations and as
$t^{-\frac{2}{3}}$ for energy correlations. The shape of these peaks is
asymptotically described by the Airy function. Furthermore, the correlation
functions have some non generic peaks with lower decay rates. In particular,
there are peaks which decay at rate $t^{-\frac{1}{4}}$ for position and
momentum correlators and with rate $t^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ for energy correlators.
The shape of these peaks is described by the Pearcey integral. Crucial for our
analysis is an appropriate generalisation of spacings, i.e. differences of the
positions of neighbouring particles, that are used as spatial variables in the
case of nearest neighbour interactions. Using the theory of circulant matrices
we are able to introduce a quantity that retains both localisation and analytic
viability. This also allows us to define and analyse some additional quantities
used for nearest neighbour chains. Finally, we study numerically the evolution
of the correlation functions after adding nonlinear perturbations to our model.
Within the time range of our numerical simulations the asymptotic description
of the linear case seems to persist for small nonlinear perturbations while
stronger nonlinearities change shape and decay rates of the peaks
significantly.

including completely-at-random, at-random or even not-at-random. All these

highly specialized approaches. This paper proposes an original, encompassing,
view of Weakly Supervised Learning, which results in the design of generic

an alternative setting called ""Biquality data"" is used. It assumes that a small

untrusted dataset of noisy examples. In this paper, we propose a new
reweigthing scheme capable of identifying noncorrupted examples in the
untrusted dataset. This allows one to learn classifiers using both datasets.
Extensive experiments that simulate several types of label noise and that vary

leads to dynamic changes and systemic problems, which have a more significant
impact on those that are most vulnerable. Ethical frameworks based only on the
individual level are no longer sufficient as they lack the necessary
articulation to provide solutions to the new challenges. A new ethical vision
must comprise the understanding of the scales and complex interconnections, as
well as the causal chains of modern social systems. Many of these systems are
internally fragile and very sensitive to external factors and threats, which
lead to unethical situations that require systemic solutions still centered on
individuals. Furthermore, the multi-layered net-like social tissue generates
clusters of power that prevent certain communities from proper development.
Digital technology has also impacted at the individual level posing the risk of
a more homogeneous, predictable and ultimately controllable humankind. To
preserve the core of humanity and the aspiration of common truth, a new ethical
framework must empower individuals and uniqueness, as well as cultural
heterogeneity, tackling the negative outcomes of digitalization. Only combining
human-centered and collectiveness-oriented digital development will it be

the case of sequences of discrete symbols, WFA and 2-RNN with linear

  Assumptions",,,,,"cs.CR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The widespread adoption of encrypted communications (e.g., the TLS protocol,
the Tor anonymity network) fixed several critical security flaws and shielded
the end-users from adversaries intercepting their transmitted data. While these
protocols are very effective in protecting the confidentiality of the users'
data (e.g., credit card numbers), it has been shown that they are prone (to
different degrees) to adversaries aiming to breach the users' privacy. Traffic
fingerprinting attacks allow an adversary to infer the webpage or the website
loaded by a user based only on patterns in the user's encrypted traffic. In
fact, many recent works managed to achieve a very high classification accuracy
under optimal conditions for the adversary.
  This paper revisits the optimality assumptions made by those works and
discusses various additional parameters that should be considered when
evaluating a fingerprinting model. We propose three realistic scenarios
simulating non-optimal fingerprinting conditions where various factors could
affect the adversary's performance or operation. We then introduce a novel
adaptive fingerprinting adversary and experimentally evaluate its accuracy and
operation. Our experiments show that adaptive adversaries can reliably uncover
the webpage visited by a user among several thousand potential pages, even
under considerable distributional shift (e.g., the webpage contents change
significantly over time). Such adversaries could infer the products a user
browses on shopping websites or log the browsing habits of state dissidents on
online forums and encyclopedias. Our technique achieves ~90% accuracy in a
top-15 setting where the model distinguishes the article visited out of 6,000
Wikipedia webpages, while the same model achieves ~80% accuracy in a dataset of
13,000 classes that were not included in the training set.

its application to novel electronics. With Moore's law beginning to plateau,
the need for post-silicon technology in industry is becoming more apparent.
Moreover, existing technology is insufficient for implementing terahertz
detectors and receivers, which are required for a number of applications
including medical imaging and security scanning. Graphene is considered to be a
key potential candidate for replacing silicon in existing CMOS technology as
well as realizing field effect transistors for terahertz detection, due to its
remarkable electronic properties, with observed electronic mobilities reaching
up to $2 \times 10^5$ cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ in suspended graphene samples.
This report reviews the physics and electronic properties of graphene in the
context of graphene transistor implementations. Common techniques used to
synthesize graphene, such as mechanical exfoliation, chemical vapor deposition,
and epitaxial growth are reviewed and compared. One of the challenges
associated with realizing graphene transistors is that graphene is
semimetallic, with a zero bandgap, which is troublesome in the context of
digital electronics applications. Thus, the report also reviews different ways
of opening a bandgap in graphene by using bilayer graphene and graphene
nanoribbons. The basic operation of a conventional field effect transistor is
explained and key figures of merit used in the literature are extracted.
Finally, a review of some examples of state-of-the-art graphene field effect

asthma later in life. The numbers of statistical tests possible were estimated
for 19 base papers considered for the meta-analysis. A p-value plot for NO2 and
PM2.5 was constructed to evaluate effect heterogeneity of p-values used from
the base papers. The numbers of statistical tests possible in the base papers
were large - median 13,824, interquartile range 1,536-221,184; range 96-42M, in
comparison to statistical test results presented. Statistical test results
drawn from the base papers are unlikely to provide unbiased measures for
meta-analysis. The p-value plot indicated that heterogeneity of the NO2 results
across the base papers is consistent with a two-component mixture. First, it
makes no sense to average across a mixture in meta-analysis. Second, the shape
of the p-value plot for NO2 appears consistent with the possibility of analysis
manipulation to obtain small p-values in several of the cohort studies. As for
PM2.5, all corresponding p-values fall on a 45-degree line indicating complete
randomness rather than a true association. Our interpretation of the
meta-analysis is that the random p-values indicating no cause-effect
associations are more plausible and that their meta-analysis will not likely
replicate in the absence of bias. We conclude that claims made in the base
papers used for meta-analysis are unreliable due to bias induced by multiple
testing and multiple modelling, MTMM. We also show there is evidence that the
heterogeneity across the base papers used for meta-analysis is more complex
than simple sampling from a normal process.

limited number of people are being allowed on-site as long as social distancing

impact of Covid-19 for their customers and employees. We introduce the quantity
Spread in which minimizing Spread gives the optimum number and arrangement of

arrangements under a social distancing measure for two different popular

optimal numbers and optimal arrangements of passengers considering both family
groups and individual passengers for the social distancing measure. The
obtained optimal arrangements of passengers show complex patterns with groups
and individual passengers mixed in complex and non-trivial ways. This
demonstrates the necessity of using our model or its variants to find these
optimal arrangements. In addition, we show that any other arrangements of
passengers with the same number of passengers is a suboptimal arrangement with
higher health risks as a result of less distance between passengers. Our model
could be implemented for other social situations such as sports events,

34000 ultracool dwarfs M7 to L2.5 that all lie within 350 pc of the plane. We
fit a profile of the form sech$^\alpha$, where $\alpha=2$ is the theoretically
preferred isothermal profile and $\alpha=0$ is the exponential function. Larger
values of $\alpha$ correspond to greater flattening of the profile towards the
plane. We employ a likelihood analysis that accounts in a direct way for
unresolved binaries in the sample, as well as for the spread in absolute
magnitude $M_J$ within each spectral sub-type (Malmquist bias). We measure
$\alpha=0.29^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$. The $\alpha=1$ (sech) and flatter profiles are
ruled out at high confidence for this sample, while $\alpha=0$ (exponential) is
included in the 95% credible interval. Any flattening relative to exponential
is modest, and is confined to within 50 pc of the plane. The measured value of
$\alpha$ is consistent with the results of the recent analysis by Xiang et al.
Our value for $\alpha$ is also similar to that determined for nearby spiral
galaxies by de Grijs et al., measured from photometry of galaxies viewed edge
on. The measured profile allows an accurate determination of the local space
density of ultracool dwarfs M7 to L2.5, and we use this to make a new
determination of the luminosity function at the bottom of the main sequence.
Our results for the luminosity function are a factor two to three lower than
the recent measurement by Bardalez Gagliuffi et al., that uses stars in the
local 25 pc radius bubble, but agree well with the older study by Cruz et al.

zonotopes and constrained zonotopes as they can compactly represent
high-dimensional sets and are closed under linear maps and Minkowski addition.
By selectively encrypting parameters of the set representations, we establish
the notion of encrypted sets and intersect sets in the encrypted domain, which
enables guaranteed state estimation while ensuring privacy. In particular, we
show that our protocols achieve computational privacy using the cryptographic

Meanwhile it is easy to construct first-order, second-order and higher-order
unconditionally energy stable time-stepping schemes. Other than that, the
ESI-SAV approach can be proved to be effective to solve the non-gradient but

induced by the secondary star, has previously been studied. Alternatively, we
also assessed the possibility that observations are compatible with eventual
jet instabilities. Results. The new radio data presented here confirm that the
large-scale radio morphology of GRS 1758-258 is changing over time. Our study
shows that the 18.48 day period could plausibly be ascribed to precession, thus
implying a reinterpretation of assumptions made for the orbital period to date.
However, the observed structural changes in radio jets cannot be easily
attributed to jet precession according to our analysis. In contrast, the growth
of instabilities certainly appears to be a more realistic explanation of these
effects.

  Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) Data",,,,,"cs.CY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Emerging micromobility services (e.g., e-scooters) have a great potential to
enhance urban mobility but more knowledge on their usage patterns is needed.
The General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS) data are a possible source for
examining micromobility trip patterns, but efforts are needed to infer trips
from the GBFS data. Existing trip inference methods are usually based upon the
assumption that the vehicle ID of a micromobility option (e-scooter or e-bike)
does not change, and so they cannot deal with data with vehicle IDs that change
over time. In this study, we propose a comprehensive package of algorithms to
infer trip origins and destinations from GBFS data with different types of
vehicle ID. We implement the algorithms in Washington DC by analyzing one-week
(last week of February 2020) of GBFS data published by six vendors, and we
evaluate the inference accuracy of the proposed algorithms by R-squared, mean
absolute error, and sum absolute error. We find that the R-squared measure is
larger than 0.9 and the MAE measure is smaller than 2 when the algorithms are
evaluated with a 400m*400m grid, and the absolute errors are relatively larger
in the downtown area. The accuracy of the trip-inference algorithms is
sufficiently high for most practical applications.

temporal feature embeddings into the response embeddings: elapsed time, the
time taken for a student to answer, and lag time, the time interval between
adjacent learning activities. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of
SAINT+ on EdNet, the largest publicly available benchmark dataset in the
education domain. Experimental results show that SAINT+ achieves
state-of-the-art performance in knowledge tracing with an improvement of 1.25%
in area under receiver operating characteristic curve compared to SAINT, the

for marketers. Most previous studies used various mathematical models to
segment customers without considering the correlation between customer
segmentation and a campaign. This work presents a conceptual model by studying
the significant campaign-dependent variables of customer targeting in customer
segmentation context. In this way, the processes of customer segmentation and
targeting thus can be linked and solved together. The outcomes of customer
segmentation of this study could be more meaningful and relevant for marketers.
This investigation applies a customer life time value (LTV) model to assess the
fitness between targeted customer groups and marketing strategies. To integrate
customer segmentation and customer targeting, this work uses the genetic
algorithm (GA) to determine the optimized marketing strategy. Later, we suggest
using C&RT (Classification and Regression Tree) in SPSS PASW Modeler as the
replacement to Genetic Algorithm technique to accomplish these results. We also
suggest using LOSSYCOUNTING and Counting Bloom Filter to dynamically design the

patient-specific data and the significant amount of time needed to record the
sufficient number of samples needed for diagnostic and treatment purposes. In
this study, we present a framework to simultaneously generate and classify
biomedical time series based on a modified Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE)
algorithm and one-dimensional convolutions. Our work is based on breathing time
series, with specific motivation to capture breathing motion during
radiotherapy lung cancer treatments. First, we explore the potential in using
the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) and AAE algorithms to model breathing from
individual patients. We extend the AAE algorithm to allow joint semi-supervised
classification and generation of different types of signals. To simplify the
modeling task, we introduce a pre-processing and post-processing compressing
algorithm that transforms the multi-dimensional time series into vectors
containing time and position values, which are transformed back into time
series through an additional neural network. By incorporating few labeled
samples during training, our model outperforms other purely discriminative
networks in classifying breathing baseline shift irregularities from a dataset
completely different from the training set. To our knowledge, the presented
framework is the first approach that unifies generation and classification
within a single model for this type of biomedical data, enabling both computer
aided diagnosis and augmentation of labeled samples within a single framework.

multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), while non-orthogonal multiple access
(NOMA) technique is employed at each UAV to further improve the spectrum
efficiency of the wireless network. The optimization problem of joint
three-dimensional (3D) trajectory design and power allocation is formulated for
maximizing the throughput. In an effort to solve this pertinent dynamic
problem, a K-means based clustering algorithm is first adopted for periodically
partitioning users. Afterward, a mutual deep Q-network (MDQN) algorithm is
proposed to jointly determine the optimal 3D trajectory and power allocation of
UAVs. In contrast to the conventional deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm, the MDQN
algorithm enables the experience of multi-agent to be input into a shared
neural network to shorten the training time with the assistance of state
abstraction. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed MDQN algorithm
has a faster convergence rate than the conventional DQN algorithm in the
multi-agent case; 2) The achievable sum rate of the NOMA enhanced UAV network
is $23\%$ superior to the case of orthogonal multiple access (OMA); 3) By
designing the optimal 3D trajectory of UAVs with the aid of the MDON algorithm,
the sum rate of the network enjoys ${142\%}$ and ${56\%}$ gains than that of
invoking the circular trajectory and the 2D trajectory, respectively.
