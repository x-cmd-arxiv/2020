necessitates an extension from Riemannian to Finsler metrics. The second part
of the paper follows the Higgs bundle approach to flat connections adapted to
this infinite dimensional group and focuses on a family of metrics, relying on
a construction of O.Biquard, which is parametrized by the infinite-dimensional
space of CR functions on the unit circle bundle of a hyperbolic surface. This
generates an alternative approach to defining a connection and offers the
possibility of this vector space representing a moduli space which generalizes

to questionable expert evidence, the post of the Forensic Science Regulator was
created in 2008. The main objective of this role is to improve the standard of
practitioner competences and forensic procedures. One of the key strategies
deployed to achieve this is the push to incorporate a greater level of
scientific conduct in the various fields of forensic practice. Currently there
is no statutory requirement for practitioners to become accredited to continue
working with the Criminal Justice System of England and Wales. However, the
Forensic Science Regulator is lobbying the UK Government to make this
mandatory. This paper focuses upon the challenge of incorporating a scientific
methodology to digital forensic investigations where malicious software
('malware') has been identified. One aspect of such a methodology is the
approach followed to both select and evaluate the tools used to perform dynamic
malware analysis during an investigation. Based on the literature, legal,
regulatory and practical needs we derive a set of requirements to address this
challenge. We present a framework, called the 'Malware Analysis Tool Evaluation
Framework' (MATEF), to address this lack of methodology to evaluate software
tools used to perform dynamic malware analysis during investigations involving
malware and discuss how it meets the derived requirements.

further developed for diatomic gas with the energy exchange between
translational and rotational modes for flow study in all regimes. The
multiscale transport mechanism in UGKWP is coming from the direct modeling in a
discretized space, where the cell's Knudsen number, defined by the ratio of
particle mean free path over the numerical cell size, determines the flow
physics simulated by the wave particle formulation. The non-equilibrium
distribution function in UGKWP is tracked by the discrete particle and
analytical wave. The weights of distributed particle and wave in different
regimes are controlled by the accumulating evolution solution of particle
transport and collision within a time step, where distinguishable macroscopic
flow variables of particle and wave are updated inside each control volume.
With the variation of local cell's Knudsen number, the UGKWP becomes a particle
method in the highly rarefied flow regime and converges to the gas-kinetic
scheme (GKS) for the Navier-Stokes solution in the continuum flow regime
without particles. Even targeting on the same solution as the discrete velocity
method (DVM)-based unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), the computational cost
and memory requirement in UGKWP could be reduced by several orders of magnitude
for the high speed and high temperature flow simulation, where the
translational and rotational non-equilibrium becomes important in the
transition and rarefied regime. As a result, 3D hypersonic computations around
a flying vehicle in all regimes can be conducted using a personal computer. The
UGKWP method for diatomic gas will be validated in various cases from one
dimensional shock structure to three dimensional flow over a sphere, and the
numerical solutions will be compared with the reference DSMC results and
experimental measurements.

factors with disease incidence from logistic regression only include cases with
newly diagnosed disease. Recently proposed methods allow incorporating
information on prevalent cases, individuals who survived from disease diagnosis
to sampling, into cross-sectionally sampled case-control studies under
parametric assumptions for the survival time after diagnosis. Here we propose
and study methods to additionally use prospectively observed survival times
from prevalent and incident cases to adjust logistic models for the time
between disease diagnosis and sampling, the backward time, for prevalent cases.
This adjustment yields unbiased odds-ratio estimates from case-control studies
that include prevalent cases. We propose a computationally simple two-step
generalized method-of-moments estimation procedure. First, we estimate the
survival distribution based on a semi-parametric Cox model using an
expectation-maximization algorithm that yields fully efficient estimates and
accommodates left truncation for the prevalent cases and right censoring. Then,
we use the estimated survival distribution in an extension of the logistic
model to three groups (controls, incident and prevalent cases), to accommodate
the survival bias in prevalent cases. In simulations, when the amount of
censoring was modest, odds-ratios from the two-step procedure were equally
efficient as those estimated by jointly optimizing the logistic and survival
data likelihoods under parametric assumptions. Even with 90% censoring they
were as efficient as estimates obtained using only cross-sectionally available
information under parametric assumptions. This indicates that utilizing
prospective survival data from the cases lessens model dependency and improves
precision of association estimates for case-control studies with prevalent
cases.

overcome this challenge, we propose HeartBees, a bio-feedback system for
visualizing collective emotional states, which maps a multi-dimensional emotion
model into a metaphorical visualization of flocks of birds. Grounded on
Affective Computing literature and physiological sensing, we mapped
physiological indicators that could be obtained from wearable devices into a
multi-dimensional emotion model, which, in turn, our HeartBees can make use of.
We evaluated our nature-inspired interactive system with 353 online

rules for the non-linear/activation layers during the backward pass, so as to
produce gradients of the input and then the attribution map. Despite the
promising results achieved, such methods are sensitive to the non-informative
high-frequency components and lack adaptability for various models and samples.
In this paper, we propose a dedicated method to generate attribution maps that
allow us to learn the propagation rules automatically, overcoming the flaws of
the handcrafted ones. Specifically, we introduce a learnable plugin module,
which enables adaptive propagation rules for each pixel, to the non-linear
layers during the backward pass for mask generating. The masked input image is
then fed into the model again to obtain new output that can be used as a
guidance when combined with the original one. The introduced learnable module
can be trained under any auto-grad framework with higher-order differential

proposed method yields state-of-the-art results and gives cleaner and more

language processing (NLP) datasets and classifiers. These include the presence
of annotation artifacts in datasets, classifiers relying on shallow features

tends to be positive), or unnecessary words (e.g., learning a proper noun to

subsequently led to the development of challenging datasets to force the model

counterfactual examples and contrast sets, have been proposed, the theoretical
justification about what makes these examples difficult for the classifier is
often lacking or unclear. In this paper, using tools from information geometry,
we propose a theoretical way to quantify the difficulty of an example in NLP.
Using our approach, we explore difficult examples for several deep learning
architectures. We discover that both BERT, CNN and fasttext are susceptible to
word substitutions in high difficulty examples. These classifiers tend to
perform poorly on the FIM test set. (generated by sampling and perturbing
difficult examples, with accuracy dropping below 50%). We replicate our
experiments on 5 NLP datasets (YelpReviewPolarity, AGNEWS, SogouNews,

bi-directional temporal coherence of the video stream and applies loss
functions that encourage both temporal cycle closure as well as contrastive
feature separation. Architecturally, the underpinning network structure
utilises a single feature encoder for all video snippets, adding two predictive
modules that learn temporal forward and backward transitions. We apply our
framework for pretext training of networks for action recognition tasks. We
report significantly improved results for the standard datasets UCF101 and

particulate media, comprised of spherical or polyhedral particles, is commonly
encountered in industrial sectors of construction (cement and rock fragments),
pharmaceutics (tablets), and transportation (ballast). Elucidating particulate
media's behavior in concert with particle attrition (i.e., particle wear and
subsequent particle fragmentation) is essential for predicting the performance
and increasing the efficiency of engineering systems using such media. Discrete
element method (DEM) based techniques can describe the interaction between
particles but cannot model intra-particle deformation, especially
intra-particle fracture. On the other hand, peridynamics provides the means to
account for intra-particle deformation and fracture due to contact forces
between particles. The present study proposes a hybrid model referred to as
\textit{PeriDEM} that combines the advantages of peridynamics and DEM. The
model parameters can be tuned to achieve desired DEM contact forces, damping
effects, and intra-particle stiffness. Two particle impacts and compressive
behavior of multi-particle systems are thoroughly investigated. The model can
account for any arbitrarily shaped particle in general. Spherical, hexagonal,
and non-convex particle shapes are simulated in the present study. The effect
of mesh resolution on intra-particle peridynamics is explicitly studied. The
proposed hybrid model opens a new avenue to explore the complicated
interactions encountered in discrete particle dynamics that involve the
formation of force chains, particle interlocking, particle attrition, wear, and
the eventual breakage.

relationship between features to classify images. By capturing the poses and
relative positions between features, its ability to recognize affine
transformation is improved, and it surpasses traditional convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) when handling translation, rotation and scaling. The Stacked
Capsule Autoencoder (SCAE) is the state-of-the-art capsule network. The SCAE
encodes an image as capsules, each of which contains poses of features and
their correlations. The encoded contents are then input into the downstream
classifier to predict the categories of the images. Existing research mainly
focuses on the security of capsule networks with dynamic routing or EM routing,
and little attention has been given to the security and robustness of the SCAE.
In this paper, we propose an evasion attack against the SCAE. After a
perturbation is generated based on the output of the object capsules in the
model, it is added to an image to reduce the contribution of the object
capsules related to the original category of the image so that the perturbed
image will be misclassified. We evaluate the attack using an image
classification experiment, and the experimental results indicate that the
attack can achieve high success rates and stealthiness. It confirms that the
SCAE has a security vulnerability whereby it is possible to craft adversarial
samples without changing the original structure of the image to fool the
classifiers. We hope that our work will make the community aware of the threat
of this attack and raise the attention given to the SCAE's security.

posed in 1967 and still open, asks for a decomposition of $K_v$ into copies of
$F$. In this paper we show that $OP(F)$ has a solution whenever $F$ has a
sufficiently large cycle which meets a given lower bound and, in addition, has
a single-flip automorphism, which is an involutory automorphism acting as a
reflection on exactly one of the cycles of $F$. Furthermore, we prove analogous
results for the minimum covering version and the maximum packing version of the
problem. We also show a similar result when the edges of $K_v$ have
multiplicity 2, but in this case we do not require that $F$ be single-flip.
  Our approach allows us to explicitly construct solutions to the Oberwolfach
Problem with well-behaved automorphisms, in contrast with some recent
asymptotic results, based on probabilistic methods, which are nonconstructive
and do not provide a lower bound on the order of $F$ that guarantees the
solvability of $OP(F)$.
  Our constructions are based on a doubling construction which applies to
graceful labelings of $2$-regular graphs with a vertex removed. We show that
this class of graphs is graceful as long as the length of the path-component is
sufficiently large. A much better lower bound on the length of the path is
given for an $\alpha$-labeling of such graphs to exist.

As a social media platform with hundreds of millions of users interacting in

questions regarding the anomaly detection are: 1) How can we detect the

by applying linguistic cues. The results of our work can help detect negative

fully described by Beilinson and Levin's elliptic polylogarithms. In this

nonlinear dynamical system by transforming the nonlinear dynamics into a higher
dimensional observable function space where the evolution of observable
functions is governed by an infinite-dimensional linear operator. For practical
application of Koopman operator theory, various data-driven methods have been
developed to derive lifted state-space models via approximation to the Koopman
operator. Based on approximate models, several Koopman-based model predictive
control (KMPC) schemes have been proposed. However, since a finite-dimensional
approximation to the infinite-dimensional Koopman operator cannot fully
represent a nonlinear dynamical system, plant-model mismatch inherently exists
in these KMPC schemes and negatively influences the performance of control
systems. In this work, we present offset-free Koopman Lyapunov-based model
predictive control (KLMPC) framework that addresses the inherent plant-model
mismatch in KMPC schemes using an offset-free control framework based on a
disturbance estimator approach and ensures feasibility and stability of the
control system by applying Lyapunov constraints to the optimal control problem.
The zero steady-state offset condition of the developed framework is
mathematically examined. The effectiveness of the developed framework is also
demonstrated by comparing the closed-loop results of the proposed offset-free
KLMPC and the nominal KLMPC.

measurements of about 1700 solar analogs from the Apache Point Observatory

for the data, we place constraints on the statistical properties of the

the fraction of stars with refractory element depletions. We find evidence for
two distinct populations: a depleted population of stars that makes up the
majority of solar analogs including the Sun, and a not-depleted population that
makes up between 10-30% of our sample. We find correlations with condensation
temperature generally in agreement with higher precision surveys of a smaller
sample of stars. Such trends, if robustly linked to the formation of planetary
systems, provide a means to connect stellar chemical abundance patterns to
planetary systems over large samples of Milky Way stars.

a generic Picard curve. By combining this with recent work of Sutherland, we
obtain a practical deterministic algorithm that computes $Z(C_p,T)$ for almost
all primes $p \le N$ using $N\log(N)^{3+o(1)}$ bit operations. This is the
first practical result of this type for curves of genus greater than 2.

positive Grassmannian ${\rm Gr}_+(k,n)$ to the Grassmannian ${\rm Gr}(k,k+m)$,
whose image is the amplituhedron $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,m}$ and is endowed with a
top-degree form called the canonical form ${\bf\Omega}(\mathcal{A}_{n,k,m})$.
This construction was introduced by Arkani-Hamed and Trnka, where they showed
that ${\bf\Omega}(\mathcal{A}_{n,k,4})$ encodes scattering amplitudes in
$\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. Moreover, the computation of
${\bf\Omega}(\mathcal{A}_{n,k,m})$ is reduced to finding the triangulations of
$\mathcal{A}_{n,k,m}$. However, while triangulations of polytopes are fully
captured by their secondary polytopes, the study of triangulations of objects
beyond polytopes is still underdeveloped.
  We initiate the geometric study of subdivisions of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,m}$ and
provide a concrete birational parametrization of fibers of $\pi: {\rm
Gr}(k,n)\dashrightarrow {\rm Gr}(k,k+m)$. We then use this to explicitly
describe a rational top-degree form $\omega_{n,k,m}$ (with simple poles) on the
fibers and compute ${\bf\Omega}(\mathcal{A}_{n,k,m})$ as a summation of certain
residues of $\omega_{n,k,m}$. As main application of our approach, we develop a
well-structured notion of secondary amplituhedra for conjugate to polytopes,
i.e. when $n-k-1=m$ (even). We show that, in this case, each fiber of $\pi$ is
parametrized by a projective space and its volume form $\omega_{n,k,m}$ has
only poles on a hyperplane arrangement. Using such linear structures, for
amplituhedra which are cyclic polytopes or conjugate to polytopes, we show that
the Jeffrey-Kirwan residue computes ${\bf\Omega}(\mathcal{A}_{n,k,m})$ from
$\omega_{n,k,m}$. Finally, we propose a more general framework of fiber
positive geometries and analyze new families of examples such as fiber
polytopes and Grassmann polytopes.

formulating it as a ranking problem in an image retrieval context on a large

on two intuitions: first, a good representation of images must yield a
high-quality image ranking in a retrieval task; second, we would expect random
views of an image to be ranked closer to a reference view of that image than
random views of other images. Hence, we model representation learning as a
learning to rank problem for image retrieval. We train a representation encoder
by maximizing average precision (AP) for ranking, where random views of an
image are considered positively related, and that of the other images
considered negatives. The new framework, dubbed S2R2, enables computing a
global objective on multiple views, compared to the local objective in the
popular contrastive learning framework, which is calculated on pairs of views.
In principle, by using a ranking criterion, we eliminate reliance on
object-centric curated datasets. When trained on STL10 and MS-COCO, S2R2
outperforms SimCLR and the clustering-based contrastive learning model, SwAV,
while being much simpler both conceptually and at implementation. On MS-COCO,
S2R2 outperforms both SwAV and SimCLR with a larger margin than on STl10. This
indicates that S2R2 is more effective on diverse scenes and could eliminate the

symmetry or cancellation between isoscalar and isovector photonic
contributions, leaving only the polarized parity-odd contribution, i.e., the
Gamow-Teller equivalent of the well-known axial $\gamma W$ box contribution for
Fermi decays. We show that weak magnetism contributes significantly to the Born
amplitude, and consider additional hadronic contributions at low energy using a
holomorphic continuation of the polarized Bjorken sum rule constrained by
experimental data. We perform the same procedure for the Fermi inner radiative
correction through a combination of the running of Bjorken and Gross-Llewellyn
Smith sum rules. We discuss heavy flavor, higher-twist, and target mass
corrections and find a significant increase at low momentum from the latter. We
find $\Delta_R^A = 0.02532(22)$ and $\Delta_R^V = 0.02473(27)$ for axial and

apply this approach to analyze the classical limits of unbounded quantities in
bosonic quantum field theories with particular attention to number operators
and Hamiltonians. The methods take classical limits in a
representation-independent manner and so allow one to compare quantities
appearing in inequivalent Fock space representations.

of energy eigenstates cross over from the groundstate scaling to a volume law.
In previous work, we pointed out that, when strong or weak eigenstate
thermalization (ETH) applies, the entanglement entropies of all or,
respectively, almost all eigenstates follow a single crossover function. The
crossover functions are determined by the subsystem entropy of thermal states
and assume universal scaling forms in quantum-critical regimes. This was
demonstrated by field-theoretical arguments and the analysis of large systems
of non-interacting fermions and bosons. Here, we substantiate such scaling
properties for integrable and non-integrable interacting spin-1/2 chains at
criticality using exact diagonalization. In particular, we analyze XXZ and
transverse-field Ising models with and without next-nearest-neighbor
interactions. Indeed, the crossover of thermal subsystem entropies can be
described by a universal scaling function following from conformal field
theory. Furthermore, we analyze the validity of ETH for entanglement in these
models. Even for the relatively small system sizes that can be simulated, the
distributions of eigenstate entanglement entropies are sharply peaked around
the subsystem entropies of the corresponding thermal ensembles.

inhomogeneous, and gravity is a nonlinear theory, thus any curvature
perturbations violate the assumptions of the FLRW model; it is not necessarily
true that local curvature, averaged over patches of constant-time surfaces,

modes on hypersurfaces of an inhomogeneous spacetime non-perturbatively in a
numerical relativistic setting, and how this curvature corresponds with that

sensitive to the impact of curvature sourced by inhomogeneities on inferred

  Aims: We study the dynamical evolution of small bodies from the Hill regions

gravitational fragmentation. We attempt to determine whether the observed
features of the orbital distribution of distant trans-Neptunian objects could
be caused by this process.
  Methods: We consider a simple model that includes the Sun, two point-like
giant clumps with masses of ~ 10 Jupiter masses, and a set of massless objects
initially located in the Hill regions of these clumps. We carry out numerical
simulations of the motions of small bodies under gravitational perturbations
from two giant clumps that move in elliptical orbits and approach each other.
The orbital distribution of these small bodies is compared with the observed
distribution of distant trans-Neptunian objects.
  Results: In addition to the known grouping in longitudes of perihelion, we
note new features for observed distant trans-Neptunian objects. The observed
orbital distribution points to the existence of two groups of distant
trans-Neptunian objects with different dynamical characteristics. We show that
the main features of the orbital distribution of distant trans-Neptunian
objects can be explained by their origin in the Hill regions of migrating giant

clumps move in high-eccentricity orbits and have a close encounter with each

and the observed distribution of distant trans-Neptunian objects have similar
features.

parameters is asymptotically normal. When the linear model is misspecified, we
propose the online weighted least squares estimator using the inverse
propensity score weighting and also establish its asymptotic normality. Based
on the properties of the parameter estimators, we further show that the
in-sample inverse propensity weighted value estimator is asymptotically normal.
We illustrate our results using simulations and an application to a news

cosmology of the Symmetrical Relativity offer proposals to explain the creation
and evolution of the universe. In essence they are still very distinct.
However, we will argue that there was an antecedent to the big bang. Thus, we
will penetrate a trans-Planckian regime, where we find an effective Planck
length $L_P^{\prime}\rightarrow 0$. This will lead to more fundamental physical
reflections about {\it nothing} in the cosmology of spontaneous creation. From
the point of view of spontaneous creation, the step backwards went back to
another principle, based on the {\it information}, which led to the big bang.
While the spontaneous creation refers to the virtual pre-existence of {\it
information}, which would have emerged randomly from {\it nothing}, the
cosmology of Symmetrical Relativity does not stop there: we go back to one's
own origin by projecting it before the creation of one's own time. From the
present perspective, {\it nothing} is a primordial vacuum, whose {\it
information} has made the universe by condensing and igniting. It was not
randomly created, since the entropy had to vary from infinite (chaos) to zero
(big bang) by violating the 2nd.law of thermodynamics in a trans-Planckian
regime. {\it Nothing} or chaos with infinite entropy precedes the big bang
(null entropy) within a trans-Planckian scenario and it determines the whole
plot until the total extinction of the universe. We will show that {\it
information}, besides not being born of the universe, also does not develop
from it like the computational idea of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Thus, the
universe is not simply self-taught as defended by the spontaneous creation.
This could shed light on the problem of Penrose's Weyl curvature hypothesis,
which considers a null Weyl curvature due to a null entropy in the big bang.

this, our simulations also show that the time-variable scattering delays have
little impact on the root mean square of the timing residuals. This suggests
that the variability seen in recovered DM, when time-variable scattering delays

indicates a deficiency of [CII] emission, possibly ascribed to various
explanations, such as a low-density gas and/or a strong radiation field caused
by intense stellar feedback, and a low metal content. From the non-detection in
the continuum we derive constraints on the dust mass, with 3-sigma upper limit

for the development of initial data to reproduce or approximate the standard
cosmological model. Usually these conditions involve the Einstein field
equations, which change if one considers alternative theories of gravity or if
the coupling matter fields change. Therefore, the derivation of conditions
which do not depend on the field equations is an advantage. In this work we
present a geometric derivation of such a condition. We require the existence of
a unit vector field to distinguish at each point of space two (non-equal)
sectional curvatures. This is equivalent for the Riemann tensor to adopt a
specific form. Our geometrical approach yields a local isometry between the
space and a Robertson-Walker space of the same dimension, curvature and metric
tensor sign (the dimension of the largest subspace on which the metric tensor
is negative definite). Remarkably, if the space is simply-connected, the
isometry is global. Our result generalize to a class of spaces of non-constant
curvature the theorem that spaces of the same constant curvature, dimension and
metric tensor sign must be locally isometric. Because we do not make any
assumptions regarding field equations, matter fields or metric tensor sign, one
can readily use this result to study cosmological models within alternative
theories of gravity or with different matter fields.

a useful theoretical concept to characterize nonequilibrium states of quantum
matter. DQPTs are marked by singular behavior in an \textit{effective free
energy} $\lambda(t)$, which, however, is a global measure, making its
experimental or theoretical detection challenging in general. We introduce two
local measures for the detection of DQPTs with the advantage of requiring fewer
resources than the full effective free energy. The first, called the
\textit{real-local} effective free energy $\lambda_M(t)$, is defined in real
space and is therefore suitable for systems where locally resolved measurements
are directly accessible such as in quantum-simulator experiments involving
Rydberg atoms or trapped ions. We test $\lambda_M(t)$ in Ising chains with
nearest-neighbor and power-law interactions, and find that this measure allows
extraction of the universal critical behavior of DQPTs. The second measure we
introduce is the \textit{momentum-local} effective free energy $\lambda_k(t)$,
which is targeted at systems where momentum-resolved quantities are more
naturally accessible, such as through time-of-flight measurements in ultracold
atoms. We benchmark $\lambda_k(t)$ for the Kitaev chain, a paradigmatic system
for topological quantum matter, in the presence of weak interactions. Our
introduced local measures for effective free energies can further facilitate
the detection of DQPTs in modern quantum-simulator experiments.

driven, radiatively-cooled cold clouds embedded in hot material, as found in
galactic outflows. In such interactions, CRs stream towards the cloud at the
Alfv\'en speed, which decreases dramatically at the cloud boundary, leading to
a bottleneck in which pressure builds up in front of the cloud. At the same
time, CRs stream along the sides of the cloud, forming a boundary layer where
large filaments develop. Shear in this boundary layer is the primary mode of
cloud destruction, which is relatively slow in all cases, but slowest in the
cases with the lowest Alfv\'en speeds. Thus the CR ray pressure in the
bottleneck region has sufficient time to accelerate the cold clouds
efficiently. Furthermore, radiative cooling has relatively little impact on
these interactions. Our simulations are two-dimensional and limited by a
simplified treatment of cosmic-ray dynamics, the neglect of CR heating, and an
idealized magnetic field geometry. Nevertheless, our results suggest that
cosmic rays, when acting as the primary source of momentum input, are capable
of accelerating clouds to velocities comparable to those observed in galaxy

in the observed mean ratio of dust mass to stellar mass of galaxies over the

IllustrisTNG show relatively little evolution, even after splitting the sample

the total luminosities and colors of nearby massive galaxies. The low surface
brightness limits of the survey ($\mu_g \approx $ 31 mag arcsec $^{-2}$ on a
one arcmin scale) allows us to implement a method, based on integrating the 1-D
surface brightness profile, that is minimally dependent on any
parameterization. We construct a sample of 1188 massive galaxies with $\log
M_*/M_\odot > 10.75$ based on the Galaxy Mass and Assembly (GAMA) survey and
measure their total luminosities and $g-r$ colors. We then compare our
measurements to various established methods applied to imaging from the Sloan
Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), focusing on those favored by the GAMA survey. In
general, we find that galaxies are brighter in the $r$ band by an average of
${\sim}0.05$ mag and bluer in $g-r$ colors by $\sim 0.06$ mag compared to the
GAMA measurements. These two differences have opposite effects on the stellar
mass estimates. The total luminosities are larger by $5\%$ but the
mass-to-light ratios are lower by $\sim 10\%$. The combined effect is that the
stellar mass estimate of massive galaxies decreases by $7\%$. This, in turn,
implies a small change in number density of massive galaxies: $\leq 30\%$ at
$\log M_*/M_\odot \geq 11$.

built within the framework of the cosmological hydro-dynamical moving mesh code
AREPO. The model resolves the multi-phase interstellar medium down to 10 K. It
forms individual stars sampled from the initial mass function (IMF), and tracks
their lifetimes and death pathways individually. Single supernova (SN) blast
waves with variable energy are followed within the hydrodynamic calculation to
interact with the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). In this paper, we
present the methods and apply the model to a $10^{10} M_{\odot}$ isolated halo.
We demonstrate that the majority of supernovae are Sedov-resolved at our
fiducial gas mass resolution of $4 M_{\odot}$. We show that our SN feedback
prescription self-consistently produces a hot phase within the ISM that drives
significant outflows, reduces the gas density and suppresses star formation.
Clustered SN play a major role in enhancing the effectiveness of feedback,
because the majority of explosions occur in low density material. Accounting
for variable SN energy allows the feedback to respond directly to stellar
evolution. We show that the ISM is sensitive to the spatially distributed
energy deposition. It strongly affects the outflow behaviour, reducing the mass
loading by a factor of 2-3, thus allowing the galaxy to retain a higher
fraction of mass and metals. LYRA makes it possible to use a comprehensive
multi-physics ISM model directly in cosmological (zoom) simulations of dwarf
and higher mass galaxies.

from a compound V$_3$Si target at room temperature onto sapphire and
oxide-coated silicon wafers, followed by rapid thermal processing under
secondary vacuum. The superconducting properties of the films thus produced are
found to improve with annealing temperature, which is ascribed to a reduction
of defects in the polycrystalline layer. Critical temperatures ($T_\text{c}$)
up to $15.3\,$K were demonstrated after thermal processing, compared to less
than $1\,$K after deposition. The $T_\text{c}$ was found to always be lower on
the silicon wafers, by on average $1.9(3)\,$K for the annealed samples. This
difference, as well as a broadening of the superconducting transitions, is
nearly independent of the annealing conditions. In-situ XRD measurements reveal
that the silicide layer becomes strained upon heating due to a mismatch between
the thermal expansion of the substrate and that of V$_3$Si. Taking into account
the volume reduction due to crystallization, this mismatch is initially larger
on sapphire, though stress relaxation allows the silicide layer to be in a
relatively unstrained state after cooling. On oxidized silicon however, no
clear evidence of relaxation upon cooling is observed, and the V$_3$Si ends up
with an out-of-plane strain of 0.3\% at room temperature. This strain increases
as the sample is cooled down to cryogenic temperatures, though the deformation
of the polycrystalline layer is expected to be highly inhomogeneous. Taking
into account also the reported occurrence of a Martensitic transition just
above the critical temperature, this extrapolated strain distribution is found
to closely match an existing model of the strain dependence of A-15
superconducting compounds.

assuming perturbing Gaussian Random Fields permeating the smooth overall lens

provides probability distributions as output, and adopts a composite loss

Future observations will further improve the sensitivity and this will require
accurate cosmological simulations to quantify possible systematic uncertainties
and to make predictions for nonlinear scales, where much information resides.
However, shot noise arising from neutrino thermal motions limits the accuracy
of simulations. In this paper, we introduce a new method for simulating
large-scale structure formation with neutrinos that accurately resolves the
neutrinos down to small scales and significantly reduces the shot noise. The
method works by tracking perturbations to the neutrino phase-space distribution
with particles and reduces shot noise in the power spectrum by a factor of
$\mathcal{O}\left(10^2\right)$ at $z=0$ for minimal neutrino masses and
significantly more at higher redshifts, without neglecting the back-reaction
caused by neutrino clustering. We prove that the method is part of a family of
optimal methods that minimize shot noise subject to a maximum deviation from
the nonlinear solution. Compared to other methods we find permille level
agreement in the matter power spectrum and percent level agreement in the
large-scale neutrino bias, but large differences in the neutrino component on
small scales. A basic version of the method can easily be implemented in
existing N-body codes and makes it possible to run neutrino simulations with
significantly reduced particle load. Further gains are possible by constructing
background models based on perturbation theory. A major advantage of this
technique is that it works well for all masses, enabling a consistent
exploration of the full neutrino parameter space.

making use of new HST photometry and Keck spectroscopy, and a recently improved
distance measurement. We apply a homogeneous photometric selection method to
the combined GC sample of DF2 and DF4. The new analysis shows that the peak of
the combined GC luminosity function remains at $M_V \approx -9$ mag. In
addition, we find a subpopulation of less luminous GCs at $M_V \approx -7.5$

magnitude range of $-5$ to $-8$ is $7.1_{-4.34}^{+7.33}$ in DF2 and
$8.6_{-4.83}^{+7.74}$ in DF4, similar to that expected from other galaxies of
the same luminosity. The total GC number between $M_V$ of $-5$ to $-11$ is
$18.5_{-4.42}^{+8.99}$ for DF2 and $18.6_{-4.92}^{+9.37}$ for DF4, calculated
from the background-subtracted GCLF. The updated total number of GCs in both

mass in either DF2 or DF4, suggesting that $N_{GC}$ is not directly determined
by the merging of halos.

which they need to mount a collective defense. To do so, honeybees use an alarm
pheromone that recruits nearby bees into mass stinging of the perceived threat.
This alarm pheromone is carried directly on the stinger, hence its
concentration builds up during the course of the attack. Here, we investigate
how individual bees react to different alarm pheromone concentrations, and how
this evolved response-pattern leads to better coordination at the group level.
We first present an individual dose-response curve to the alarm pheromone,
obtained experimentally. Second, we apply Projective Simulation to model each
bee as an artificial learning agent that relies on the pheromone concentration
to decide whether to sting or not. If the emergent collective performance
benefits the colony, the individual reactions that led to it are enhanced via
reinforcement learning, thus emulating natural selection. Predators are modeled
in a realistic way so that the effect of factors such as their resistance,
their killing rate or their frequency of attacks can be studied. We are able to
reproduce the experimentally measured response-pattern of real bees, and to
identify the main selection pressures that shaped it. Finally, we apply the
model to a case study: by tuning the parameters to represent the environmental
conditions of European or African bees, we can predict the difference in
aggressiveness observed between these two subspecies.

Yet, many of these are plagued by a fundamental question: When gauge symmetry
is only approximate in the quantum device, do we actually quantum-simulate a
gauge theory? Here, we answer this question in the affirmative for a paradigm
gauge theory akin to quantum electrodynamics. Analytically, we derive a
renormalized gauge symmetry that is at least exponentially accurate. Further,
numerically computing the phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit, we find
that the long-distance behavior of the gauge theory is only compromised upon
reaching a sharp quantum phase transition. This behavior is enabled by an
energy penalty term, which lends a mass to the Higgs boson to which the
coherent gauge breaking couples. Our results not only lend validity to ongoing

where the masses of the particles participating in the interaction cannot be
neglected. By using an inclusive jet function to describe the scattered quark
final state, we can restrict the needed parton kinematic approximations just to
the four-momentum conservation of the hard scattering process, and explicitly
expand the rest of the diagram in powers of the unobserved parton transverse
momenta rather than neglecting those. This procedure provides one with more
flexibility in fixing the virtuality of the scattered and recoiling partons
than in the standard derivation, and naturally leads to scaling variables that
more faithfully represent the partonic kinematic at sub-asymptotic energy than
the Bjorken's xB variable.

considering a diquark spectator model designed to reproduce the main features
of electron-proton scattering at large $x_B$ in Quantum Chromo-Dynamics. In the
model, the Deep Inelastic Scattering contribution to the cross section can be
explicitly isolated and analytically calculated, then compared to the
factorized approximation. Limiting ourselves to the leading twist contribution,
we then show that use of the new scaling variables maximizes the kinematic
range of validity of collinear factorization, and highlight the intrinsic
limitations of this approach due to the unavoidably approximate treatment of
four momentum conservation in factorized diagrams. Finally, we briefly discuss

macro (e.g. structural) levels, and it may be important to be fair to
attributes at multiple levels. For example, instead of simply considering race
as a causal, protected attribute of an individual, the cause may be distilled
as perceived racial discrimination an individual experiences, which in turn can
be affected by neighborhood-level factors. This multi-level conceptualization
is relevant to questions of fairness, as it may not only be important to take
into account if the individual belonged to another demographic group, but also
if the individual received advantaged treatment at the macro-level. In this
paper, we formalize the problem of multi-level fairness using tools from causal
inference in a manner that allows one to assess and account for effects of
sensitive attributes at multiple levels. We show importance of the problem by
illustrating residual unfairness if macro-level sensitive attributes are not
accounted for, or included without accounting for their multi-level nature.
Further, in the context of a real-world task of predicting income based on
macro and individual-level attributes, we demonstrate an approach for
mitigating unfairness, a result of multi-level sensitive attributes.

approach to modeling probability distributions that has become ubiquitous in
deep learning. The softmax function is defined by a lone hyperparameter, the
temperature, that is commonly set to one or regarded as a way to tune model
confidence after training; however, less is known about how the temperature
impacts training dynamics or generalization performance. In this work we
develop a theory of early learning for models trained with
softmax-cross-entropy loss and show that the learning dynamics depend crucially
on the inverse-temperature $\beta$ as well as the magnitude of the logits at
initialization, $||\beta{\bf z}||_{2}$. We follow up these analytic results
with a large-scale empirical study of a variety of model architectures trained
on CIFAR10, ImageNet, and IMDB sentiment analysis. We find that generalization
performance depends strongly on the temperature, but only weakly on the initial
logit magnitude. We provide evidence that the dependence of generalization on
$\beta$ is not due to changes in model confidence, but is a dynamical
phenomenon. It follows that the addition of $\beta$ as a tunable hyperparameter
is key to maximizing model performance. Although we find the optimal $\beta$ to
be sensitive to the architecture, our results suggest that tuning $\beta$ over
the range $10^{-2}$ to $10^1$ improves performance over all architectures
studied. We find that smaller $\beta$ may lead to better peak performance at
the cost of learning stability.

the risk of obesity in schoolchildren. To achieve this goal, we propose a
two-stage Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework. In the first stage,
examining the position of FFRs relative to that of some reference locations -
in our case, schools - we model the distances of FFRs from these reference
locations as realizations of Inhomogenous Poisson processes (IPP). With the
goal of identifying representative spatial patterns of exposure to FFRs, we
model the intensity functions of the IPPs using a Bayesian non-parametric
viewpoint and specifying a Nested Dirichlet Process prior. The second stage
model relates exposure patterns to obesity, offering two different approaches
to accommodate uncertainty in the exposure patterns estimated in the first
stage: in the first approach the odds of obesity at the school level is
regressed on cluster indicators, each representing a major pattern of exposure
to FFRs. In the second, we employ Bayesian Kernel Machine regression to relate
the odds of obesity to the multivariate vector reporting the degree of
similarity of a given school to all other schools. Our analysis on the
influence of patterns of FFR occurrence on obesity among Californian
schoolchildren has indicated that, in 2010, among schools that are consistently
assigned to a cluster, there is a lower odds of obesity amongst 9th graders who
attend schools with most distant FFR occurrences in a 1-mile radius as compared

overconfidence on out-of-distribution (OOD) data and ungraceful failing under
distributional shift. Previous benchmarks have found that ensembles of neural
networks (NNs) are typically the best calibrated models on OOD data. Inspired
by this, we leverage recent theoretical advances that characterize the
function-space prior of an ensemble of infinitely-wide NNs as a Gaussian
process, termed the neural network Gaussian process (NNGP). We use the NNGP
with a softmax link function to build a probabilistic model for multi-class
classification and marginalize over the latent Gaussian outputs to sample from
the posterior. This gives us a better understanding of the implicit prior NNs
place on function space and allows a direct comparison of the calibration of
the NNGP and its finite-width analogue. We also examine the calibration of
previous approaches to classification with the NNGP, which treat classification
problems as regression to the one-hot labels. In this case the Bayesian
posterior is exact, and we compare several heuristics to generate a categorical
distribution over classes. We find these methods are well calibrated under
distributional shift. Finally, we consider an infinite-width final layer in
conjunction with a pre-trained embedding. This replicates the important
practical use case of transfer learning and allows scaling to significantly
larger datasets. As well as achieving competitive predictive accuracy, this

the light nodes. Recently, a technique based on erasure codes called Coded
Merkle Tree (CMT) was proposed by Yu et al. that enables light nodes to detect
a DA attack with high probability. The CMT is constructed using LDPC codes for
fast decoding but can fail to detect a DA attack if a malicious node hides a
small stopping set of the code. To combat this, Yu et al. used well-studied
techniques to design random LDPC codes with high minimum stopping set size.
Although effective, these codes are not necessarily optimal for this
application. In this paper, we demonstrate a more specialized LDPC code design
to improve the security against DA attacks. We achieve this goal by providing a
deterministic LDPC code construction that focuses on concentrating stopping
sets to a small group of variable nodes rather than only eliminating stopping
sets. We design these codes by modifying the Progressive Edge Growth algorithm
into a technique called the entropy-constrained PEG (EC-PEG) algorithm. This
new method demonstrates a higher probability of detecting DA attacks and allows
for good codes at short lengths.

recognition has received an increasing interest over the last years. As

have been proposed for this task. While current graph convolutional networks
accurately recognize actions, they are too expensive for robotics applications

therefore propose a highly efficient graph convolutional network that addresses
the limitations of previous works. This is achieved by a parallel structure
that gradually fuses motion and spatial information and by reducing the
temporal resolution as early as possible. Furthermore, we explicitly address
the issue that human poses can contain errors. To this end, the network first
refines the poses before they are further processed to recognize the action. We
therefore call the network Pose Refinement Graph Convolutional Network.
Compared to other graph convolutional networks, our network requires 86\%-93\%
less parameters and reduces the floating point operations by 89%-96% while
achieving a comparable accuracy. It therefore provides a much better trade-off
between accuracy, memory footprint and processing time, which makes it suitable

two extreme cases where every time-series is disconnected from every other
time-series in the collection or likewise, that every time-series is related to
every other time-series resulting in a completely connected graph. In this
work, we propose a deep hybrid probabilistic graph-based forecasting framework
called Graph Deep Factors (GraphDF) that goes beyond these two extremes by
allowing nodes and their time-series to be connected to others in an arbitrary
fashion. GraphDF is a hybrid forecasting framework that consists of a
relational global and relational local model. In particular, we propose a
relational global model that learns complex non-linear time-series patterns
globally using the structure of the graph to improve both forecasting accuracy
and computational efficiency. Similarly, instead of modeling every time-series
independently, we learn a relational local model that not only considers its
individual time-series but also the time-series of nodes that are connected in
the graph. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep
hybrid graph-based forecasting model compared to the state-of-the-art methods
in terms of its forecasting accuracy, runtime, and scalability. Our case study
reveals that GraphDF can successfully generate cloud usage forecasts and
opportunistically schedule workloads to increase cloud cluster utilization by

still weakly bounded. Hence, we revisit binary decision trees on real-valued
features from the perspective of partitions of the data. We introduce the
notion of partitioning function, and we relate it to the growth function and to
the VC dimension. Using this new concept, we are able to find the exact VC
dimension of decision stumps, which is given by the largest integer $d$ such
that $2\ell \ge \binom{d}{\left\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\right\rfloor}$, where $\ell$
is the number of real-valued features. We provide a recursive expression to
bound the partitioning functions, resulting in a upper bound on the growth
function of any decision tree structure. This allows us to show that the VC
dimension of a binary tree structure with $N$ internal nodes is of order $N
\log(N\ell)$. Finally, we elaborate a pruning algorithm based on these results

advantage that no cross-validation is required.

improved by $\sim 50$% when including cross-$M_{\rm ap}$. It is further boosted
by the use of 1D $M_{\rm ap}$ that outperforms all other estimators, including

Moreover, we develop regret bounds for ZO with residual feedback for both

estimates with much smaller variance compared to conventional one-point

Numerical experiments show that ZO with residual feedback significantly

optimal indemnity functions both with and without the customary ex ante

ambiguity (multiplicity of priors) on the structure of optimal indemnity
functions. In particular, we show how the singularity in beliefs leads to an
optimal indemnity function that involves full insurance on an event to which
the insurer assigns zero probability, while the decision maker assigns a
positive probability. We examine several illustrative examples, and we provide

both neural-network architectures and the data they model become increasingly
complex. Unique challenges arise when a model's input features become high
dimensional: on one hand, principled model-agnostic approaches to
explainability become too computationally expensive; on the other, more
efficient explainability algorithms lack natural interpretations for general
users. In this work, we introduce a framework for human-interpretable
explainability on high-dimensional data, consisting of two modules. First, we
apply a semantically meaningful latent representation, both to reduce the raw
dimensionality of the data, and to ensure its human interpretability. These
latent features can be learnt, e.g. explicitly as disentangled representations
or implicitly through image-to-image translation, or they can be based on any
computable quantities the user chooses. Second, we adapt the Shapley paradigm
for model-agnostic explainability to operate on these latent features. This
leads to interpretable model explanations that are both theoretically
controlled and computationally tractable. We benchmark our approach on
synthetic data and demonstrate its effectiveness on several
image-classification tasks.

datasets. In order to bring together disparate data sources, dataset discovery
methods rely on some form of schema matching: the process of establishing
correspondences between datasets. Traditionally, schema matching has been used
to find matching pairs of columns between a source and a target schema.
However, the use of schema matching in dataset discovery methods differs from
its original use. Nowadays schema matching serves as a building block for
indicating and ranking inter-dataset relationships. Surprisingly, although a
discovery method's success relies highly on the quality of the underlying
matching algorithms, the latest discovery methods employ existing schema
matching algorithms in an ad-hoc fashion due to the lack of openly-available
datasets with ground truth, reference method implementations, and evaluation
metrics. In this paper, we aim to rectify the problem of evaluating the
effectiveness and efficiency of schema matching methods for the specific needs
of dataset discovery. To this end, we propose Valentine, an extensible
open-source experiment suite to execute and organize large-scale automated
matching experiments on tabular data. Valentine includes implementations of
seminal schema matching methods that we either implemented from scratch (due to
absence of open source code) or imported from open repositories. The
contributions of Valentine are: i) the definition of four schema matching
scenarios as encountered in dataset discovery methods, ii) a principled dataset
fabrication process tailored to the scope of dataset discovery methods and iii)
the most comprehensive evaluation of schema matching techniques to date,
offering insight on the strengths and weaknesses of existing techniques, that
can serve as a guide for employing schema matching in future dataset discovery

basis of the well-known generalized additive models is proposed. It can be
viewed as an extension or a modification of the algorithm using the neural
additive model. The method is based on using an ensemble of gradient boosting
machines (GBMs) such that each GBM is learned on a single feature and produces
a shape function of the feature. The ensemble is composed as a weighted sum of
separate GBMs resulting a weighted sum of shape functions which form the
generalized additive model. GBMs are built in parallel using randomized
decision trees of depth 1, which provide a very simple architecture. Weights of
GBMs as well as features are computed in each iteration of boosting by using
the Lasso method and then updated by means of a specific smoothing procedure.
In contrast to the neural additive model, the method provides weights of
features in the explicit form, and it is simply trained. A lot of numerical
experiments with an algorithm implementing the proposed method on synthetic and

to use model explainability to gain insights into model fairness, however
existing explainability tools do not reliably indicate whether a model is
indeed fair. In this work we present a new approach to explaining fairness in

explanations attribute a model's overall unfairness to individual input
features, even in cases where the model does not operate on sensitive
attributes directly. Moreover, motivated by the linearity of Shapley
explainability, we propose a meta algorithm for applying existing training-time
fairness interventions, wherein one trains a perturbation to the original

perturbation, and the fair-corrected model, we gain insight into the
accuracy-fairness trade-off that is being made by the intervention. We further
show that this meta algorithm enjoys both flexibility and stability benefits

it turns out that they can be significantly different than the GR ones. This

children with disabilities to be able to control a robot to manipulate toys in
a play environment, and for a helper to demonstrate the desired trajectories as
the play tasks change. A relatively inexpensive 3-DOF haptic device made by
Novint is used to perform tasks where trajectories of the end-effector are
demonstrated and reproduced. Under the condition where the end-effector carries
different loads, conventional control systems possess the potential issue that
they cannot compensate for the load variation effect. Adaptive tracking control
can handle the above issue. Using the Lyapunov stability theory, a set of
update laws are derived to give closed-loop stability with proper tracking

reconstructing them from omics data is challenging because correlation does not
imply causation. Combining genomics and transcriptomics data from a segregating
population allows to orient the direction of causality between gene expression
traits using genomic variants. Instrumental-variable methods (IV) use a local
expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) as a randomized instrument for a
gene's expression level, and assign target genes based on distal eQTL
associations. Mediation-based methods (ME) additionally require that distal
eQTL associations are mediated by the source gene. Here we used Findr, a
software providing uniform implementations of IV, ME, and coexpression-based
methods, a recent dataset of 1,012 segregants from a cross between two budding
yeast strains, and the YEASTRACT database of known transcriptional interactions
to compare causal gene network inference methods. We found that causal
inference methods result in a significant overlap with the ground-truth,
whereas coexpression did not perform better than random. A subsampling analysis
revealed that the performance of ME decreases at large sample sizes, due to a
loss of sensitivity when residual correlations become significant. IV methods
contain false positive predictions, due to genomic linkage between eQTL
instruments. IV and ME methods also have complementary roles for identifying
causal genes underlying transcriptional hotspots. IV methods correctly
predicted STB5 targets for a hotspot centred on the transcription factor STB5,
whereas ME failed due to Stb5p auto-regulating its own expression. ME suggests
a new candidate gene, DNM1, for a hotspot on Chr XII, where IV methods could
not distinguish between multiple genes located within the hotspot.

gravitational waves and memory for asymptotically-flat spacetimes of slow
decay. These structures do not arise in spacetimes resulting from data that is
stationary outside a compact set. Rather the more general situations exhibit
richer geometric-analytic interactions displaying the physics of these more
general systems. It has been known that for stronger decay of the data
gravitational wave memory is finite and of electric parity only. We investigate
general spacetimes that are asymptotically flat in a rough sense, where the
decay of the data to Minkowski space towards infinity is very slow. Main new
feature: We prove that there exists diverging magnetic memory sourced by the
magnetic part of the curvature tensor (a) in the Einstein vacuum and (b) in the
Einstein-null-fluid equations. The magnetic memory occurs naturally in the
Einstein vacuum setting (a) of pure gravity. In case (b), in the ultimate class
of solutions, the magnetic memory also contains a curl term from the
energy-momentum tensor for neutrinos also diverging at the highest rate. The
electric memory diverges too, it is generated by the electric part of the
curvature tensor and in the Einstein-null-fluid situation also by the
corresponding energy-momentum component. In addition, we find a panorama of
finer structures in these manifolds. Some of these manifest themselves as
additional contributions to both electric and magnetic memory. Our theorems
hold for any type of matter or energy coupled to the Einstein equations as long
as the data decays slowly towards infinity and other conditions are satisfied.

expressed as a sum of terms that scale linearly with its volume and area, plus
a correction term that is independent of its size. We conjecture that these
states have an efficient dual description in terms of a set of marginal density
matrices on bounded regions, obeying the same entropy scaling law locally. We
prove a restricted version of this conjecture for translationally invariant
systems in two spatial dimensions. Specifically, we prove that a
translationally invariant marginal obeying three non-linear constraints -- all

consistent with some global state on an infinite lattice. Moreover, we derive a

The main challenge is that the steady flow properties (Herschel-Bulkley model
parameters) used in the current dimensionless group cannot be defined or
measured for thixotropically aged samples, because any deformation inherently
rejuvenates and breaks down the microstructure. We find the most suitable
hypothesis is to only increase the yield stress ($\sigma_{\rm y}$, plastic

viscous parameters ($K$ or $\eta_{\infty}$) constant. The work reveals
fundamental insight into rarely studied short-timescale flow conditions with

  Architecture",,,,,"cs.CR cs.DC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed, and decentralized machine learning
protocol. By executing FL, a set of agents can jointly train a model without
sharing their datasets with each other, or a third-party. This makes FL
particularly suitable for settings where data privacy is desired.
  At the same time, concealing training data gives attackers an opportunity to
inject backdoors into the trained model. It has been shown that an attacker can
inject backdoors to the trained model during FL, and then can leverage the
backdoor to make the model misclassify later. Several works tried to alleviate
this threat by designing robust aggregation functions. However, given more
sophisticated attacks are developed over time, which by-pass the existing
defenses, we approach this problem from a complementary angle in this work.
Particularly, we aim to discourage backdoor attacks by detecting, and punishing
the attackers, possibly after the end of training phase.
  To this end, we develop a hybrid blockchain-based FL framework that uses
smart contracts to automatically detect, and punish the attackers via monetary
penalties. Our framework is general in the sense that, any aggregation
function, and any attacker detection algorithm can be plugged into it. We
conduct experiments to demonstrate that our framework preserves the
communication-efficient nature of FL, and provide empirical results to
illustrate that it can successfully penalize attackers by leveraging our novel
attacker detection algorithm.

partial point clouds. Existing works usually estimate the missing shape by
decoding a latent feature encoded from the input points. However, real-world
objects are usually with diverse topologies and surface details, which a latent
feature may fail to represent to recover a clean and complete surface. To this
end, we propose a skeleton-bridged point completion network (SK-PCN) for shape
completion. Given a partial scan, our method first predicts its 3D skeleton to
obtain the global structure, and completes the surface by learning
displacements from skeletal points. We decouple the shape completion into
structure estimation and surface reconstruction, which eases the learning
difficulty and benefits our method to obtain on-surface details. Besides,
considering the missing features during encoding input points, SK-PCN adopts a
local adjustment strategy that merges the input point cloud to our predictions
for surface refinement. Comparing with previous methods, our skeleton-bridged
manner better supports point normal estimation to obtain the full surface mesh
beyond point clouds. The qualitative and quantitative experiments on both point
cloud and mesh completion show that our approach outperforms the existing
methods on various object categories.

added incrementally and distributed evenly in the explored region, yielding the
best viewpoints. To further shortening exploration time and ensuring safety,
our planner optimizes paths locally and refine them based on the Euclidean

allows the proposed planner to quickly search alternative paths to avoid

hindering widespread adoption of unsupervised representation learning methods
across domains and modalities. To address this, we propose viewmaker networks:
generative models that learn to produce useful views from a given input.
Viewmakers are stochastic bounded adversaries: they produce views by generating
and then adding an $\ell_p$-bounded perturbation to the input, and are trained
adversarially with respect to the main encoder network. Remarkably, when
pretraining on CIFAR-10, our learned views enable comparable transfer accuracy
to the well-tuned SimCLR augmentations -- despite not including transformations
like cropping or color jitter. Furthermore, our learned views significantly
outperform baseline augmentations on speech recordings (+9% points, on average)
and wearable sensor data (+17% points). Viewmakers can also be combined with
handcrafted views: they improve robustness to common image corruptions and can
increase transfer performance in cases where handcrafted views are less
explored. These results suggest that viewmakers may provide a path towards more
general representation learning algorithms -- reducing the domain expertise and
effort needed to pretrain on a much wider set of domains. Code is available at

Here, we report an in-depth evaluation of multiple conformation selection
techniques, including simple averaging, Boltzmann weighting, lowest energy
selection, low energy threshold reductions, and similarity reduction.
Generating 50,000 conformers each for 18 molecules, we used the In Silico
Chemical Library Engine (ISiCLE) to calculate the collision cross sections for
the entire dataset. First, we employed Monte Carlo simulations to understand
the variability between conformer structures as generated using simulated
annealing. Then we employed Monte Carlo simulations to the aforementioned
conformer selection techniques applied on the simulated molecular property -
the ion mobility collision cross section. Based on our analyses, we found
Boltzmann weighting to be a good tradeoff between precision and theoretical
accuracy. Combining multiple techniques revealed that energy thresholds and
root-mean-squared deviation-based similarity reductions can save considerable
computational expense while maintaining property prediction accuracy. Molecular
dynamic conformer generation tools like AMBER can continue to generate new
lowest energy conformers even after tens of thousands of generations,
decreasing precision between runs. This reduced precision can be ameliorated
and theoretical accuracy increased by running density functional theory
geometry optimization on carefully selected conformers.

prioritization of radiologists' reading lists for reducing turnaround times in

counts were significantly lower during (40.1 +/- 7.9) than before (44.4 +/-

AI during than before the COVID-19 outbreak (p<0.05), with approximately one
daily ICH+ case more than statistically expected. Conclusion: Our results
suggest that, by tracking both large-scale utilization and AI results data in

curves for coastal flooding and demonstrate which insights can be gained from
the functions only. Therefore, we include protection cost curves -- relating
the typical investment costs necessary to protect a city against a natural
hazard of certain magnitude -- which are analogous to and consistent with the
above mentioned damage cost curves. Specifically, we motivate log-logistic
functions, which exhibit a power-law increase at the lower end, and fit them to
the cost curves. As expected, cities with large maximum potential loss
(typically large cities) are also more costly to protect. Moreover, we study
the idealized case of continuous adaptation, i.e.\ increasing protection levels

residual damage from extreme events exceeding the protection. Based on the

The main aims of this paper are: a) to derive reliable estimates for the BH
mass and accretion rates for the Type-1 AGN in this survey; b) to characterize
the properties of the AGN driven winds in the BLR. We analyzed rest-frame
optical and UV spectra of 21 Type-1 AGN. We found that the BH masses estimated
from H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines are in agreement. We estimate BH masses in
the range Log(M$\rm_{BH}/M_{\odot}$)=8.4-10.8 and Eddington ratios
$\rm\lambda_{Edd}$ =0.04-1.3. We confirm that the CIV line width does not
correlate with the Balmer lines and the peak of the line profile is
blue-shifted with respect to the [OIII]-based systemic redshift. These findings
support the idea that the CIV line is tracing outflowing gas in the BLR, with
velocities up to $\sim$4700 km/s. We confirm the strong dependence of the BLR
wind velocity with the UV-to-Xray continuum slope, L$\rm_{Bol}$ and
$\rm\lambda_{Edd}$. We inferred BLR mass outflow rates in the range 0.005-3
M$_{\odot}$/yr, showing a correlation with the bolometric luminosity consistent
with that observed for ionized winds in the NLR and X-ray winds detected in
local AGN, and kinetic power $\sim$10$^{[-7:-4]}\times$ L$\rm_{Bol}$. Finally,
we found an anti-correlation between the equivalent width of the [OIII] line
with respect to the CIV shift, and a positive correlation with [OIII] outflow
velocity. These findings, for the first time in an unbiased sample of AGN at

matching consists in the recognition of a pattern obtained from a sensor's

user to input several different commands with a low dimensionality interface

(Actigraph GT9X and LSM9DS1) and results were compared with the data fusion
results from a validated commercial sensor (XSens MVN system).
Cross-correlation analyses [r], root-mean-square error (RMSE) and average
absolute error of estimate were used to establish the construct validity of the
algorithm. Five subjects each performed ten different arm elevation tasks. The
results show that the algorithm is valid to evaluate shoulder movements with
high correlations between the results of the two different sensors and the

to a practical reality. This is due to continued progress in three key areas: a
mathematical understanding of locomotion, the computational ability to encode
this mathematics through optimization, and the hardware capable of realizing
this understanding in practice. In this context, this review article outlines
the end-to-end process of methods which have proven effective in the literature
for achieving dynamic walking on bipedal robots. We begin by introducing
mathematical models of locomotion, from reduced order models that capture
essential walking behaviors to hybrid dynamical systems that encode the full
order continuous dynamics along with discrete footstrike dynamics. These models
form the basis for gait generation via (nonlinear) optimization problems.
Finally, models and their generated gaits merge in the context of real-time
control, wherein walking behaviors are translated to hardware. The concepts
presented are illustrated throughout in simulation, and experimental
instantiation on multiple walking platforms are highlighted to demonstrate the
ability to realize dynamic walking on bipedal robots that is agile and

existence of optimal policies have in general been established via converting
the original partially observed stochastic control problem to a fully observed
one on the belief space, leading to a belief-MDP. However, computing an optimal
policy for this fully observed model, and so for the original POMDP, using
classical dynamic or linear programming methods is challenging even if the
original system has finite state and action spaces, since the state space of
the fully observed belief-MDP model is always uncountable. Furthermore, there
exist very few rigorous value function approximation and optimal policy
approximation results, as regularity conditions needed often require a tedious
study involving the spaces of probability measures leading to properties such
as Feller continuity. In this paper, we study a planning problem for POMDPs
where the system dynamics and measurement channel model are assumed to be
known. We construct an approximate belief model by discretizing the belief
space using only finite window information variables. We then find optimal
policies for the approximate model and we rigorously establish near optimality
of the constructed finite window control policies in POMDPs under mild
non-linear filter stability conditions and the assumption that the measurement

establish a rate of convergence result which relates the finite window memory
size and the approximation error bound, where the rate of convergence is
exponential under explicit and testable exponential filter stability
conditions. While there exist many experimental results and few rigorous
asymptotic convergence results, an explicit rate of convergence result is new

considerably when the voltage data window for feature extraction is reduced, or
when features from the charge voltage curve instead of discharge are used. As
deep constant-current discharges rarely happen in practice, this imposes new

with a summary statistic before performing Bayesian inference, and the choice
of this statistic is often difficult. The summary statistic should be
low-dimensional for computational reasons, while retaining as much information
as possible about the parameter. Using a recent idea from the interpretable
machine learning literature, we develop some regression-based diagnostic
methods which are useful for detecting when different parts of a summary
statistic vector contain conflicting information about the model parameters.
Conflicts of this kind complicate summary statistic choice, and detecting them
can be insightful about model deficiencies and guide model improvement. The
diagnostic methods developed are based on regression approaches to
likelihood-free inference, in which the regression model estimates the
posterior density using summary statistics as features. Deletion and imputation
of part of the summary statistic vector within the regression model can remove
conflicts and approximate posterior distributions for summary statistic
subsets. A larger than expected change in the estimated posterior density
following deletion and imputation can indicate a conflict in which inferences
of interest are affected. The usefulness of the new methods is demonstrated in
a number of real examples.

learning algorithms for robots to learn complex behaviors in real-world
environments. However, obtaining sufficient demonstrations may be impractical
because many behaviors are difficult for humans to demonstrate. A more
practical approach is to replace human demonstrations by human queries, i.e.,
preference-based reinforcement learning. One key limitation of the existing
algorithms is the need for a significant amount of human queries because a
large number of labeled data is needed to train neural networks for the
approximation of a continuous, high-dimensional reward function. To reduce and
minimize the need for human queries, we propose a new GAN-assisted human
preference-based reinforcement learning approach that uses a generative
adversarial network (GAN) to actively learn human preferences and then replace
the role of human in assigning preferences. The adversarial neural network is
simple and only has a binary output, hence requiring much less human queries to
train. Moreover, a maximum entropy based reinforcement learning algorithm is
designed to shape the loss towards the desired regions or away from the
undesired regions. To show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we
present some studies on complex robotic tasks without access to the environment
reward in a typical MuJoCo robot locomotion environment. The obtained results
show our method can achieve a reduction of about 99.8% human time without
performance sacrifice.

adaptive methods (e.g. Adam) and accelerated schemes (e.g. stochastic gradient

worse compared to SGD; for complex settings such as generative adversarial

stability.We propose AdaBelief to simultaneously achieve three goals: fast
convergence as in adaptive methods, good generalization as in SGD, and training
stability. The intuition for AdaBelief is to adapt the stepsize according to
the ""belief"" in the current gradient direction. Viewing the exponential moving
average (EMA) of the noisy gradient as the prediction of the gradient at the
next time step, if the observed gradient greatly deviates from the prediction,
we distrust the current observation and take a small step; if the observed
gradient is close to the prediction, we trust it and take a large step. We
validate AdaBelief in extensive experiments, showing that it outperforms other
methods with fast convergence and high accuracy on image classification and
language modeling. Specifically, on ImageNet, AdaBelief achieves comparable
accuracy to SGD. Furthermore, in the training of a GAN on Cifar10, AdaBelief
demonstrates high stability and improves the quality of generated samples

two set of pseudo labels are used to jointly train a student network with the

pre-maximum high-resolution spectroscopy. All 12 novae show the same spectral
evolution. Before optical peak, they show a slow P Cygni component. After peak
a fast component quickly arises, while the slow absorption remains superimposed
on top of it, implying the presence of at least two physically distinct flows.
For novae with high-cadence monitoring, a third, intermediate-velocity
component is also observed.
  These observations are consistent with a scenario where the slow component is
associated with the initial ejection of the accreted material and the fast
component with a radiation-driven wind from the white dwarf. When these flows
interact, the slow flow is swept up by the fast flow, producing the
intermediate component. These colliding flows may produce the gamma-ray
emission observed in some novae. Our spectra also show that the transient heavy
element absorption lines seen in some novae have the same velocity structure
and evolution as the other lines in the spectrum, implying an association with
the nova ejecta rather than a pre-existing circumbinary reservoir of gas or
material ablated from the secondary. While this basic scenario appears to
qualitatively reproduce multi-wavelength observations of classical novae,
substantial theoretical and observational work is still needed to untangle the
rich diversity of nova properties.

multi-parametric imaging. PETenabled dual-energy CT combines a low-energy x-ray
CT image with a high-energy &\gamma&-ray CT (GCT) image reconstructed from
time-of-flight PET emission data to enable dual-energy CT material
decomposition on a PET/CT scanner. The maximumlikelihood attenuation and
activity (MLAA) algorithm has been used for GCT reconstruction but suffers from
noise. Kernel MLAA exploits an x-ray CT image prior through the kernel
framework to guide GCT reconstruction and has demonstrated substantial
improvements in noise suppression. However, similar to other kernel methods for
image reconstruction, the existing kernel MLAA uses image intensity-based
features to construct the kernel representation, which is not always robust and
may lead to suboptimal reconstruction with artifacts. In this paper, we propose
a modified kernel method by using an autoencoder convolutional neural network
(CNN) to extract an intrinsic feature set from the x-ray CT image prior. A
computer simulation study was conducted to compare the autoencoder CNN-derived
feature representation with raw image patches for evaluation of kernel MLAA for
GCT image reconstruction and dual-energy multimaterial decomposition. The
results show that the autoencoder kernel MLAA method can achieve a significant
image quality improvement for GCT and material decomposition as compared to the
existing kernel MLAA algorithm. A weakness of the proposed method is its
potential over-smoothness in a bone region, indicating the importance of
further optimization in future work. The codes is available on

a successful attack, during operation, the trained classifier will: 1)
misclassify a test image from the source class(es) to the target class whenever

kinetic inductance detector (CB-KID), where neutrons are converted into charged
particles using a 10B conversion layer. The charged particles are detected
based on local changes in kinetic inductance of X and Y superconducting
meanderlines under a modest DC bias current. The system uses a delay-line
method to locate the positions of neutron-10B reactions by acquiring the four
arrival timestamps of signals that propagate from hot spots created by a
passing charged particle to the end electrodes of the meanderlines. Unlike
conventional multi-pixel imaging systems, the CB-KID system performs high
spatial resolution imaging over a 15 mm x 15 mm sensitive area using only four
channel readouts. Given the large sensitive area, it is important to check the
spatial homogeneity and linearity of detected neutron positions when imaging
with CB-KID. To this end we imaged a pattern of 10B dot absorbers with a
precise dot pitch to investigate the spatial homogeneity of the detector. We
confirmed the spatial homogeneity of detected dot positions based on the
distribution of measured dot pitches across the sensitive area of the detector.
We demonstrate potential applications of the system by taking a clear
transmission image of tiny metallic screws and nuts and a ladybug. The image
was useful for characterizing the ladybug noninvasively. Detection efficiencies
were low when the detector was operated at 4 K, so we plan to explore raising
the operating temperature towards the critical temperature of the detector as a
means to improve counting rates.

framework for reducing the computational cost of a class of molecular dynamics
simulations with constrained latent variables. The XLMD method relaxes the
constraints by introducing a fictitious mass $\varepsilon$ for the latent
variables, solving a set of singularly perturbed ordinary differential
equations. While favorable numerical performance of XLMD has been demonstrated
in several different contexts in the past decade, mathematical analysis of the
method remains scarce. We propose the first error analysis of the XLMD method
in the context of a classical polarizable force field model. While the dynamics
with respect to the atomic degrees of freedom are general and nonlinear, the
key mathematical simplification of the polarizable force field model is that
the constraints on the latent variables are given by a linear system of
equations. We prove that when the initial value of the latent variables is
compatible in a sense that we define, XLMD converges as the fictitious mass
$\varepsilon$ is made small with $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ error for the
atomic degrees of freedom and with $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ error for
the latent variables, when the dimension of the latent variable $d'$ is 1.
Furthermore, when the initial value of the latent variables is improved to be
optimally compatible in a certain sense, we prove that the convergence rate can
be improved to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ for the latent variables as well.
Numerical results verify that both estimates are sharp not only for $d' =1$,
but also for arbitrary $d'$. In the setting of general $d'$, we do obtain
convergence, but with the non-sharp rate of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$
for both the atomic and latent variables.

its orbital motion. In this paper, we investigate several broad emission lines
of PG1302-102 using archived UV spectra obtained by IUE, GALEX, and Hubble, to

obvious periodical variation. Adopting a simple model for the BLR, we perform
Markov chain Monte Carlo fittings to these broad lines, and find that the BLR
must be viewed at an orientation angle of $\sim33^{\circ}$, close to face-on.
If the Doppler boosting interpretation is correct, then the BLR is misaligned
with the BBH orbital plane by an angle of $\sim51^\circ$, which suggests that
the Doppler boosted continuum variation has little effect on the broad-line
emission and thus does not lead to periodical line variation. We further
discuss the possible implications for such a BLR configuration with respect to

separated appearance and motion information-for example, using a pre-trained
optical flow model. This explicit separation restricts reciprocal
representation capabilities between two types of information. In contrast, we
propose an implicit two-path AE (ITAE), a structure in which two encoders
implicitly model appearance and motion features, along with a single decoder
that combines them to learn normal video patterns. For the complex distribution
of normal scenes, we suggest normal density estimation of ITAE features through
normalizing flow (NF)-based generative models to learn the tractable
likelihoods and identify anomalies using out of distribution detection. NF
models intensify ITAE performance by learning normality through implicitly
learned features. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ITAE and its
feature distribution modeling on six benchmarks, including databases that
contain various anomalies in real-world scenarios.

E(G) \to \{+, -\}$ is a signature which assigns to each edge of $G$ a sign.
Various notions of coloring of signed graphs have been studied. In this paper,
we extend circular coloring of graphs to signed graphs. Given a signed graph
$(G, \sigma)$ a circular $r$-coloring of $(G, \sigma)$ is an assignment $\psi$
of points of a circle of circumference $r$ to the vertices of $G$ such that for
every edge $e=uv$ of $G$, if $\sigma(e)=+$, then $\psi(u)$ and $\psi(v)$ have
distance at least $1$, and if $\sigma(e)=-$, then $\psi(v)$ and the antipodal
of $\psi(u)$ have distance at least $1$. The circular chromatic number
$\chi_c(G, \sigma)$ of a signed graph $(G, \sigma)$ is the infimum of those $r$
for which $(G, \sigma)$ admits a circular $r$-coloring. For a graph $G$, we
define the signed circular chromatic number of $G$ to be $\max\{\chi_c(G,
\sigma): \sigma \text{ is a signature of $G$}\}$.
  We study basic properties of circular coloring of signed graphs and develop
tools for calculating $\chi_c(G, \sigma)$. We explore the relation between the
circular chromatic number and the signed circular chromatic number of graphs,
and present bounds for the signed circular chromatic number of some families of
graphs. In particular, we determine the supremum of the signed circular
chromatic number of $k$-chromatic graphs of large girth, of simple bipartite
planar graphs, $d$-degenerate graphs, simple outerplanar graphs and
series-parallel graphs. We construct a signed planar simple graph whose
circular chromatic number is $4+\frac{2}{3}$. This is based and improves on a
signed graph built by Kardos and Narboni as a counterexample to a conjecture of
M\'{a}\v{c}ajov\'{a}, Raspaud, and \v{S}koviera.

over data distributed across multiple data owners without centralizing clients'
raw data. However, sharing of local model updates can also reveal information
of clients' local datasets. Trusted execution environments (TEEs) within the FL
server have been recently deployed by companies like Meta for secure
aggregation. However, secure aggregation can suffer from error-prone local
updates sent by clients that become faulty during training due to underlying
device malfunctions. Also, data heterogeneity across clients makes fault
mitigation challenging, as even updates from normal clients are dissimilar.
Thus, most of the prior fault tolerant methods, which treat any local update
differing from the majority of other updates as faulty, perform poorly. We
propose DiverseFL to make model aggregation secure as well as robust to faults.
In DiverseFL, any client whose local model update diverges from its associated
guiding update is tagged as being faulty. To implement our novel per-client
criteria for fault mitigation, DiverseFL creates a TEE-based secure enclave
within the FL server, which in addition to performing secure aggregation for
carrying out the global model update step, securely receives a small
representative sample of local data from each client only once before training,
and computes guiding updates for each participating client during training.
Thus, DiverseFL provides security against privacy leakage as well as robustness
against faulty clients. In experiments, DiverseFL consistently achieves
significant improvements in absolute test accuracy over prior fault mitigation
benchmarks. DiverseFL also performs closely to OracleSGD, where server combines
updates only from the normal clients. We also analyze the convergence rate of

  EMNLP-2020",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Constituency parsing is a fundamental and important task for natural language
understanding, where a good representation of contextual information can help
this task. N-grams, which is a conventional type of feature for contextual
information, have been demonstrated to be useful in many tasks, and thus could
also be beneficial for constituency parsing if they are appropriately modeled.
In this paper, we propose span attention for neural chart-based constituency
parsing to leverage n-gram information. Considering that current chart-based
parsers with Transformer-based encoder represent spans by subtraction of the
hidden states at the span boundaries, which may cause information loss
especially for long spans, we incorporate n-grams into span representations by
weighting them according to their contributions to the parsing process.
Moreover, we propose categorical span attention to further enhance the model by
weighting n-grams within different length categories, and thus benefit
long-sentence parsing. Experimental results on three widely used benchmark
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in parsing Arabic,
Chinese, and English, where state-of-the-art performance is obtained by our
approach on all of them.

we propose a method that can detect and estimate the age of multi-person with a

EELG candidates with intense emission lines and estimated observed-frame
equivalent width (EW) of $\gtrsim 1000$ angstrom over the UltraVISTA-DR2
ultra-deep stripe in the COSMOS field. We then carried out a HK band follow-up
spectroscopy for 23 of the candidates with Subaru/MOIRCS, and find that 19 and
two of them are at $z>3$ with intense [OIII] emission, and H$\alpha$ emitters
at $z\simeq 2$, respectively. These spectroscopically identified EELGs at
$z\simeq 3.3$ show, on average, higher specific star formation rates (sSFR)
than the star-forming main sequence, low dust attenuation of $E(B-V) \lesssim
0.1$ mag, and high [OIII]/[OII] ratios of $\gtrsim 3$. We also find that our
EELGs at $z\simeq 3.3$ have higher hydrogen ionizing photon production
efficiencies ($\xi_\mathrm{ion}$) than the canonical value ($\simeq 10^{25.2}$
Hz/erg), indicating that they are efficient in ionizing their surrounding
interstellar medium. These physical properties suggest that they are low
metallicity galaxies with higher ionization parameters and harder UV spectra
than normal SFGs, which is similar to galaxies with Lyman continuum (LyC)

motion is predominantly influenced by the smallest turbulent scales in the
flow. We can exploit this property by using an Arnold--Beltrami--Childress
(ABC) flow instead of a full direct numerical simulation (DNS) to simulate the
turbulent effect on cloud drop collisions. This allows simulation of drop
motion using much less computational resources than needed by DNS and
therefore, allows for simulations with many more drops and larger model domains
or more complex cloud physics. This is useful in cases where a specific process
needs to be studied and the complexity and details of a realistic turbulent
flow are of secondary interest.
  It is shown that the simulations using ABC flow can faithfully reproduce
collision statistics from much more comprehensive DNS calculations when using a
similar Taylor microscale and root mean square velocity in the ABC and DNS
flows. The results from the ABC flow are robust to changes in these two
parameters within a reasonable range, even though adjustments to the parameters
can be used to further tune the results.

(donor/mixed/acceptor) BHJ, where the (intermediate) mixed-phase can inhibit
morphological changes, such as phase separation. Using a mean-field approach,
we reveal and distinguish, between generic mechanisms that alter through
transverse instabilities the evolution of stripes: the bending (zigzag mode)
and the pinching (cross-roll mode) of the donor/acceptor domains. The results
are summarized in a parameter plane spanned by the mixing energy and
illumination, and show that donor-acceptor mixtures with higher mixing energy
are more likely to develop pinching under charge-flux boundary conditions. The
latter is notorious as it leads to the formation of disconnected domains and
hence to loss of charge flux. We believe that these results provide a
qualitative road-map for BHJ optimization, using mixed-phase composition and
therefore, an essential step toward long-lasting OPV. More broadly, the results
are also of relevance to study the coexistence of multiple-phase domains in

the coupling constant for a phantom dilaton field. In the noncritical case, the
target space is $\mathbb R\times {\rm SL}(2,\mathbb R)/H$ with the maximal
subgroup $H=\{{\rm SO}(2), {\rm SO}(1,1)\}$, whereas in the critical case the
target space becomes a symmetric pp-wave and the corresponding Killing vectors
form a non-semisimple algebra. In either case, we apply the formalism to charge
up the neutral solutions and show the analytical expression for dilatonic
charged versions of (i) the Fisher solution, (ii) the Gibbons solution, and
(iii) the Ellis-Bronnikov solution. We discuss global structures of these
solutions in detail. It turns out that some solutions contained in the Fisher
and Gibbons classes possess the parallelly propagated (p.p) curvature
singularities in the parameter region where all the scalar curvature invariants
remain bounded. These p.p curvature singularities are not veiled by a horizon,
thrusting them into physically untenable nakedly singular spacetimes. We also
demonstrate that the dilatonic-charged Ellis-Bronnikov solution admits a
parameter range under which the solution represents a regular wormhole
spacetime in the two-sided asymptotically flat regions.

To illustrate the point, we construct a four-parametric family of

charged point particle in those backgrounds is insensitive to a particular
permutation of the parameters although this very permutation does alter the
background geometry. In particular, we find that a direct product of the
Euclidean plane with the two-dimensional Euclidean black hole admits a
point-particle T-dual with asymptotically negative curvature. For neutral
particles, this point-particle T-duality picture gets slightly modified because
the T-duality map is no longer defined everywhere but only on a dense open

learning community in recent years due to their ability to handle convex
constraints that are popular in many applications, but for which computing
projections is often computationally impractical in high-dimensional settings,
and hence prohibit the use of most standard projection-based methods. In
particular, a significant research effort was put on projection-free methods
for online learning. In this paper we revisit the Online Frank-Wolfe (OFW)
method suggested by Hazan and Kale \cite{Hazan12} and fill a gap that has been
left unnoticed for several years: OFW achieves a faster rate of $O(T^{2/3})$ on
strongly convex functions (as opposed to the standard $O(T^{3/4})$ for convex
but not strongly convex functions), where $T$ is the sequence length. This is
somewhat surprising since it is known that for offline optimization, in
general, strong convexity does not lead to faster rates for Frank-Wolfe. We
also revisit the bandit setting under strong convexity and prove a similar
bound of $\tilde O(T^{2/3})$ (instead of $O(T^{3/4})$ without strong
convexity). Hence, in the current state-of-affairs, the best projection-free
upper-bounds for the full-information and bandit settings with strongly convex

equations for a variable composition mixture and the combustion modelling is
based on a phenomenological approach: the flame propagation is represented by
the transport of the characteristic function of the burnt zone, where the
chemical reaction is complete; outside this zone, the atmosphere remains in its
fresh state. Numerically, we approximate this problem by a penalization-like
approach, i.e. using a finite conversion rate with a characteristic time
tending to zero with the space and time steps. The numerical scheme works on
staggered, possibly unstructured, meshes. The time-marching algorithm is of
segregated type, and consists in solving in a first step the chemical species
mass balances and then, in a second step, mass, momentum and energy balances.
For this latter stage of the algorithm, we use a pressure correction technique,
and solve a balance equation for the so-called sensible enthalpy instead of the
total energy balance, with corrective terms for consistency. The scheme is
shown to satisfy the same stability properties as the continuous problem: the
chemical species mass fractions are kept in the [0, 1] interval, the density
and the sensible internal energy stay positive and the integral over the
computational domain of a discrete total energy is conserved. In addition, we
show that the scheme is in fact conservative, i.e. that its solution satisfy a
conservative discrete total energy balance equation, with space and time
discretizations which are unusual but consistent in the Lax-Wendroff sense.
Finally, we observe numerically that the penalization procedure converges, i.e.
that making the chemical time scale tend to zero allows to converge to the
solution of the target (infinitely fast chemistry) continuous problem. Tests
also evidence that the scheme accuracy dramatically depends on the
discretization of the convection operator in the chemical species mass
balances. October 14, 2020.

negative-parity spectra. [Method:] The structure of $^{24}$Mg was calculated
using the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics~(AMD). Proton and alpha inelastic

by folding the Melbourne $g$-matrix $NN$ interaction with the AMD densities of

phenomena associated to scattering resonances, leading to numerical
instabilities in approximating the solution. This result can be established via
the ``quasimodes to resonances'' argument from the black-box scattering
framework. Those localized phenomena concentrate at the inner boundary of the
cavity and are called whispering gallery modes. In this paper we investigate
scattering resonances for unbounded transmission problems with sign-changing
coefficient (corresponding to optical cavities with negative optical
properties, for example made of metamaterials). Due to the change of sign of
optical properties, previous results cannot be applied directly, and interface
phenomena at the metamaterial-dielectric interface (such as the so-called
surface plasmons) emerge. We establish the existence of scattering resonances
for arbitrary two-dimensional smooth metamaterial cavities. The proof relies on
an asymptotic characterization of the resonances, and showing that problems
with sign-changing coefficient naturally fit the black box scattering

metamaterial's properties, scattering resonances situated closed to the real

water due to factors such as population and economic growth. In less than 30
years, the need for energy and water will nearly double globally. As the energy
and water resources are limited, it is critical to have a sustainable
energy-water nexus framework to meet these growing demands. Renewable energies
provide substantial opportunities in energy-water nexuses by boosting energy
and water reliability and sustainability and can be less water-intensive than
conventional technologies. These resources, such as wind and solar power, do
not need water inputs. As a result, they can be used as a supplement to the
energy-water nexus portfolio. In this paper, renewable energies in energy-water
nexus have been investigated for a range of possible scenarios. As renewable
energy resources are not deterministic, fuzzy logic is used to model the
uncertainty. The results show that renewable energies can significantly improve
the energy-water nexus planning; however, the power grid reliability on

led to volatile depletion and concurrent mass-dependent fractionation of the
isotopes of moderately volatile elements (MVE). The detailed processes and
conditions surrounding this episode remain obscured and are not unified by a
single model for all volatile elements and compounds. Using available data,
including new Zn isotope data for eight lunar samples, we demonstrate that the
isotopic fractionation of MVE in the Moon is best expressed by non-ideal
Rayleigh distillation, approaching the fractionation factor {\alpha} using the
reduced masses of the evaporated isotopologues. With these calculations a best
fit for the data is obtained when the lunar MVE isotope data is normalized to
ordinary or enstatite chondrites ({\Delta}Moon-OC,EC), rather than a bulk
silicate Earth (BSE) composition. This analysis further indicates that the
parent body from which the Moon formed cannot have partitioned S into its core
based on S isotope compositions of lunar rocks. The best fit between
{\Delta}Moon-OC,EC and modelled non-ideal Rayleigh fractionation is defined by
a slope that corresponds to a saturation index of 90 +/- 4 %. In contrast, the
older Highland suite is defined by a saturation index of 75 +/- 2 %, suggesting
the vapor phase pressure was higher during mare basalt eruptions. This provides
the first tangible evidence that the Moon was veiled by a thin atmosphere
during mare basalt eruption events spanning at least from 3.8 to 3 billion
years ago and implies that MVE isotope fractionation dominantly occurred after
the Moon had accreted.

perfectly align representations of different domains, i.e. their input

propose to learn so-called hypothesis invariant representations (HIRs), which
relax the invariance assumptions by merely aligning posteriors, instead of
aligning representations. We report experimental results on public domain

constructing stellar model grids, the initial helium abundance is estimated
either (i) by using the semi-empirical helium-to-heavy element enrichment
ratio, (${\Delta Y}/{\Delta Z}$), anchored to the standard Big Bang
Nucleosynthesis value or (ii) by setting the initial helium abundance as a free
variable. Adopting 35 low-mass, solar-type stars with multi-year Kepler
photometry from the asteroseismic ""LEGACY"" sample, we explore the systematic
uncertainties on the inferred stellar parameters (i.e., radius, mass, and age)
arising from the treatment of the initial helium abundance in stellar model

  electricity demand based on the customers risk aversion behavior","32 pages, 19 figures, 12 tables, 32 refrences",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Nowadays, attitudes towards electricity customers have been changed, so that
they are no longer considered static players. The customers behavior
identification is vital for establishing modern power systems. This paper
utilizes the customers risk aversion coefficient to model their consumption
behavior. Through the coefficients, the value of electricity consumption is
measured employing the concept of the utility function. The utility function is
an essential concept in microeconomics that measures customers preferences and
interprets how a rational consumer would make consumption decisions. Based on
the utility function, an economic load model and the customers welfare function
are formulated. The load model is utilized to estimate price elasticity, and
income elasticity of electricity demand. The results illustrated as the risk
aversion coefficient increases, the consumers achieve more satisfaction from
the consumption. Electricity consumption will be complement (substitute) if the
risk aversion coefficient is greater (lower) than the unit. For the unit risk
aversion coefficient, the cross-price elasticity will be zero, which means the
consumption is independent of the other period demand. The results illustrated
electricity price increment neutralizes the income increment effect on
consumption. Hence, to study electricity consumption, the price and income
variations should be considered, simultaneously.

the behavior of hyperbolic edge exciton polaritons in Bi2Se3. Edge polaritons
are hybrid modes that result from the coupling of the polaritons bound to the
upper and lower edges of Bi2Se3 nanoplatelets. In particular, we use electron
energy-loss spectroscopy to compare Fabry-P\'erot-like resonances emerging in
edge polariton propagation along pristine and artificially structured edges of
the nanoplatelets. The experimentally observed scattering of edge polaritons by
defect structures was found to be in good agreement with finite-difference
time-domain simulations. Moreover, we experimentally proved coupling of
localized polaritons in identical open and closed circular nanocavities to the
propagating edge polaritons. Our findings are testimony to the extraordinary
capability of the hyperbolic polariton propagation to cope with the presence of

networks and their potential bottlenecks have not yet been fully examined.
Furthermore, the vehicular scenarios can be identified as the locations, where
the social distancing is mostly violated. With this motivation, this article
provides an extensive discussion on vehicular networking for combating a
pandemic. We provide the major applications of vehicular networking for
combating COVID-19 in public transportation, in-vehicle diagnosis, border

neural network to estimate the ground-truth posterior for the simulation of
interest. Training the network and accumulating the dataset alternatively in a
sequential manner could save the total simulation budget by orders of

within a portion of the total simulation budget to accumulate upon the
collected dataset. This newly accumulated data degenerates because the set of
simulation inputs is hardly mixed, and this degenerated data collection process
ruins the posterior inference. This paper introduces a new sampling approach,
called Neural Proposal (NP), of the simulation input that resolves the biased
data collection as it guarantees the i.i.d. sampling. The experiments show the
improved performance of our sampler, especially for the simulations with

to be erroneous. In this paper, we address the occlusion problem by exploiting
the current and future possible locations of the target object from its past

takes into account background motion modeling and trajectory prediction. Our
trajectory prediction module predicts the target object's locations in the
current and future frames based on the object's past trajectory. Since, in the
input video, the target object's trajectory is not only affected by the object
motion but also the camera motion, our background motion module estimates the
camera motion. So that the object's trajectory can be made independent from it.
To dynamically switch between the appearance-based tracker and the trajectory
prediction, we employ a network that can assess how good a tracking prediction
is, and we use the assessment scores to choose between the appearance-based
tracker's prediction and the trajectory-based prediction. Comprehensive
evaluations show that the proposed method sets a new state-of-the-art
performance on commonly used tracking benchmarks.

within the pair-instability (PI) mass gap, and it is difficult to form because
of the effects of PI supernovae (PISNe) and pulsational PI (PPI). In this
study, we examined the formation of GW190521-like BH-BHs under Population (Pop)
III environments by binary population synthesis calculations. We reveal that
convective overshooting in stellar evolution strongly affects the formation of
GW190521-like BH-BHs. A model with a small overshoot parameter (similar to
GENEC) can form GW190521-like BH-BHs. The derived merger rate is $4 \times
10^{-2}$ ${\rm yr}^{-1}$ ${\rm Gpc}^{-3}$ at a redshift of $\sim 0.82$, which
is comparable to the merger rate of GW190521-like BH-BHs inferred by
gravitational wave (GW) observations. In this model, a $\sim 90~M_\odot$ star
collapses to form a $\sim 90~M_\odot$ BH by avoiding PPI and PISN even if it is
a member of a binary star. This is because it expands up to $10^2~R_\odot$, and
lose only little mass through binary evolution. However, a model with a large
overshoot parameter (similar to Stern) cannot form GW190521-like BH-BHs at all.
Thus, we cannot conclude that a Pop~III binary system is the origin of GW190521
because determination of the overshoot parameter involves highly uncertain. If
a Pop~III binary system is the origin of GW190521, the merger rate of BH-BHs
including a $100-135~M_\odot$ BH is substantially smaller than that of
GW190521-like BH-BHs. This will be assessed by GW observations in the near
future.

key issues for a general multi-hop reasoning model: i) where to go, and ii)

with three modules: 1) the local-global knowledge module to estimate the
possible paths, 2) the differentiated action dropout module to explore a
diverse set of paths, and 3) the adaptive stopping search module to avoid over
searching. The comprehensive results on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of our model with significant improvements against baselines in

a starburst or a central quasar plus cold mode accretion (infall), which adds
to the mass build-up in the galaxies. To study the nature of these infall and
outflows in the quasar environments, we have examined the correlation of narrow
absorption lines (NALs) at positive and negative velocity shifts to other
quasar properties, such as their broad absorption-line (BAL) outflows and
radio-loudness, using spectral data from SDSS-BOSS DR12. Our results show that
the incidence of associated absorption lines (AALs) and outflow AALs is
strongly correlated with BALs, which indicates most AALs form in quasar-driven
outflows. Multiple AALs are also strongly correlated with BALs, demonstrating
quasar outflows tend to be highly structured and can create multiple gas
components with different velocity shifts along our line of sight. Infall AALs
appear less often in quasars with BALs than quasars without BALs. This suggests
that BAL outflows act on large scale in host galaxies and inhibit the infall of
gas from the IGM, supporting theoretical models in which quasar outflow plays
an important role in the feedback to host galaxies. Despite having larger
distances, infall AALs are more highly ionized than outflow AALs, which can be
attributed to the lower densities in the infall absorbers.

in suppressing magnetic activity is also investigated. On a sample of flaring
giant stars we search for flaring specialities which may be associated with the
giant nature. We search for flares using the full K1 data on a sample of 706
stars compiled from two lists of flaring giants found in the literature. In the
end, we confirm only 61 stars as flaring giants. Among these 61 flaring giants
we found only six which also show oscillations; we suggest that a large
fraction of the 61 flaring giants are members of spectroscopic binaries which
are proven already for 11. Tests are carried out to correct the detection bias
at low flare energies for a subsample of 19 further studied, frequently flaring
stars. For these 19 stars flare energy distributions and flare frequency
diagrams (FFDs) are constructed. The number of detected flares on giant stars
correlate only weakly with the rotational periods. The 61 confirmed flaring
giant stars make up only about 0.3% of the entire giant star population in the
Kepler database, in contrast with previous estimates of about an order higher
percentage. No strong correlation was found between the stellar properties and
the flaring characteristics. The wide scale of the flaring specialities are
hardly related to the giant nature, if at all. This, together with the finding
that the observed flare durations correlate with flare energies, regardless of
the flare energy level and stellar luminosity class, suggest common background
physics in flaring stars, or in other words, a general scaling effect behind.

an energy harvesting (EH) source-equipped remote sensing setting is considered.
The EH source opportunistically samples one or multiple processes over discrete
time instants and sends the status updates to a sink node over a time-varying
wireless link. At any discrete-time instant, the EH node decides whether to
probe the link quality using its stored energy and further decides whether to
sample a process and communicate the data based on the channel probe outcome.
The trade-off is between the freshness of information available at the sink
node and the available energy at the energy buffer of the source node. To this
end, an infinite horizon Markov decision process theory is used to formulate
the problem of minimization of time-averaged expected AoI for a single energy
harvesting source node. The following two scenarios are considered: (i) single
process with channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT), (ii) multiple
processes with CSIT. In each scenario, for probed channel state, the optimal
source node sampling policy is shown to be a threshold policy involving the
instantaneous age of the process(es), the available energy in the buffer, and
the instantaneous channel quality as the decision variables. Finally, numerical
results are provided to demonstrate the policy structures and trade-offs.

managing the complexities of system development. MBSE empowers the formalisms
of system architectures for supporting model-based requirement elicitation,
specification, design, development, testing, fielding, etc. However, the
modeling languages and techniques are quite heterogeneous, even within the same
enterprise system, which creates difficulties for data interoperability. The
discrepancies among data structures and language syntaxes make information
exchange among MBSE models even more difficult, resulting in considerable
information deviations when connecting data flows across the enterprise. For
this reason, this paper presents an ontology based upon graphs, objects,
points, properties, roles, and relationships with entensions (GOPPRRE),
providing meta models that support the various lifecycle stages of MBSE
formalisms. In particular, knowledge-graph models are developed to support
unified model representations to further implement ontological data integration
based on GOPPRRE throughout the entire lifecycle. The applicability of the MBSE
formalism is verified using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Moreover,
the GOPPRRE ontologies are generated from the MBSE language formalisms in a
domain-specific modeling tool, \textit{MetaGraph} in order to evaluate its
availiablity. The results demonstrate that the proposed ontology supports both
formal structures and the descriptive logic of the systems engineering

sparsity and unexplained recommendation. To address these challenges, many
works propose to exploit semantic information from review data. However, these
methods have two major limitations in terms of the way to model textual
features and capture textual interaction. For textual modeling, they simply
concatenate all the reviews of a user/item into a single review. However,
feature extraction at word/phrase level can violate the meaning of the original
reviews. As for textual interaction, they defer the interactions to the
prediction layer, making them fail to capture complex correlations between
users and items. To address those limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical
Text Interaction model(HTI) for rating prediction. In HTI, we propose to model
low-level word semantics and high-level review representations hierarchically.
The hierarchy allows us to exploit textual features at different granularities.
To further capture complex user-item interactions, we propose to exploit
semantic correlations between each user-item pair at different hierarchies. At
word level, we propose an attention mechanism specialized to each user-item
pair, and capture the important words for representing each review. At review
level, we mutually propagate textual features between the user and item, and
capture the informative reviews. The aggregated review representations are
integrated into a collaborative filtering framework for rating prediction.
Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate that HTI outperforms
state-of-the-art models by a large margin. Further case studies provide a deep
insight into HTI's ability to capture semantic correlations at different levels
of granularities for rating prediction.

frequency-dependent explicitly-correlated electron-hole interaction kernel
(FD-GSIK) to address the computation bottleneck associated with these

dense manifold of particle-hole states by constructing a transformed set of
dressed particle-holes states. Electron-hole correlation is introduced by using
an explicitly correlated, frequency-dependent two-body operator which is local
in real-space representation. The resulting electron-hole interaction kernel
expressed in an energy-restricted subspace of particle-hole excitations is
derived using the Lowdin's partitioning theory. Finally, the excitation

generalized pseudoeigenvalue equation. The FD-GSIK method was used to
investigate low-lying excited states of a series of silver linear clusters and

adequately learn from, we improve the model performance of both a
sentence-level and a contextual model without using any additional data. We
target the improvement of pronoun translations through our fine-tuning and
evaluate our models on a pronoun benchmark testset. Our sentence-level model
shows a 0.5 BLEU improvement on both the WMT14 and the IWSLT13 De-En testsets,
while our contextual model achieves the best results, improving from 31.81 to
32 BLEU on WMT14 De-En testset, and from 32.10 to 33.13 on the IWSLT13 De-En
testset, with corresponding improvements in pronoun translation. We further
show the generalizability of our method by reproducing the improvements on two
additional language pairs, Fr-En and Cs-En. Code available at

  Electrocardiogram Signal Classification",,,,,"eess.SP cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An essential part for the accurate classification of electrocardiogram (ECG)
signals is the extraction of informative yet general features, which are able
to discriminate diseases. Cardiovascular abnormalities manifest themselves in
features on different time scales: small scale morphological features, such as
missing P-waves, as well as rhythmical features apparent on heart rate scales.
For this reason we incorporate a variant of the complex wavelet transform,
called a scatter transform, in a deep residual neural network (ResNet). The
former has the advantage of being derived from theory, making it well behaved
under certain transformations of the input. The latter has proven useful in ECG
classification, allowing feature extraction and classification to be learned in
an end-to-end manner. Through the incorporation of trainable layers in between
scatter transforms, the model gains the ability to combine information from
different channels, yielding more informative features for the classification
task and adapting them to the specific domain. For evaluation, we submitted our
model in the official phase in the PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge
2020. Our (Team Triage) approach achieved a challenge validation score of
0.640, and full test score of 0.485, placing us 4th out of 41 in the official

vision-based localization and mapping tasks in dynamic environments, where the
presence (or absence) of different dynamic objects in different moments makes
these tasks less robust. We introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework to
turn images of an urban environment that include dynamic content, such as
vehicles or pedestrians, into realistic static frames suitable for localization
and mapping. This objective faces two main challenges: detecting the dynamic
objects, and inpainting the static occluded back-ground. The first challenge is
addressed by the use of a convolutional network that learns a multi-class
semantic segmentation of the image. The second challenge is approached with a
generative adversarial model that, taking as input the original dynamic image
and the computed dynamic/static binary mask, is capable of generating the final
static image. This framework makes use of two new losses, one based on image
steganalysis techniques, useful to improve the inpainting quality, and another
one based on ORB features, designed to enhance feature matching between real

extensive evaluation on different tasks that are affected by dynamic entities,

is important to detect and control the misinformation in such platforms before
it spreads to the masses. In this work, we focus on rumors, which is one type
of misinformation (other types are fake news, hoaxes, etc). One way to control
the spread of the rumors is by identifying users who are possibly the rumor
spreaders, that is, users who are often involved in spreading the rumors. Due
to the lack of availability of rumor spreaders labeled dataset (which is an
expensive task), we use publicly available PHEME dataset, which contains rumor
and non-rumor tweets information, and then apply a weak supervised learning
approach to transform the PHEME dataset into rumor spreaders dataset. We
utilize three types of features, that is, user, text, and ego-network features,
before applying various supervised learning approaches. In particular, to
exploit the inherent network property in this dataset (user-user reply graph),
we explore Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), a type of Graph Neural Network

LSTM. Extensive experiments performed on the rumor spreaders dataset, where we
achieve up to 0.864 value for F1-Score and 0.720 value for AUC-ROC, shows the

several mirror pairs in the middle mass range. For the first time the
correlation between the thickness of the neutron skin and the characteristics
related with the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy is
investigated simultaneously for nuclei and their corresponding mirror partners.
As an example, the Ni isotopic chain with mass number $A=48-60$ is considered.
These quantities are calculated within the coherent density fluctuation model
using Brueckner and Skyrme energy-density functionals for isospin asymmetric
nuclear matter with two Skyrme-type effective interactions, SkM* and SLy4.
Results are also presented for the symmetry energy as a function of $A$ for a
family of mirror pairs from selected chains of nuclei with $Z=20$, $N=14$, and
$N=50$. The evolution curves show a similar behavior crossing at the $N=Z$

test for some real high-frequency financial data. We observe that in almost
half of the days tested, the assumption of constant volatility within a day is
violated. And this is due to that the stock prices during opening and closing

subjectivity. In recent years, the target representation of image aesthetic
quality has changed from a one-dimensional binary classification label or
numerical score to a multi-dimensional score distribution. According to current
methods, the ground truth score distributions are straightforwardly regressed.
However, the subjectivity of aesthetics is not taken into account, that is to
say, the psychological processes of human beings are not taken into
consideration, which limits the performance of the task. In this paper, we
propose a Deep Drift-Diffusion (DDD) model inspired by psychologists to predict
aesthetic score distribution from images. The DDD model can describe the
psychological process of aesthetic perception instead of traditional modeling
of the results of assessment. We use deep convolution neural networks to
regress the parameters of the drift-diffusion model. The experimental results
in large scale aesthetic image datasets reveal that our novel DDD model is
simple but efficient, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in
aesthetic score distribution prediction. Besides, different psychological
processes can also be predicted by our model.

interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). The parallel diffusion of
particles is reduced because the magnetic turbulence level in sheath region
bounded by ICME's leading edge and shock is high. Besides, in sheath and
magnetic cloud (MC) energetic particles would feel enhanced magnetic focusing
effect caused by the strong inhomogeneity of the background magnetic field.
Therefore, particles would be partially blocked in sheath-MC structure. Here,
we study two-step Fds by considering the magnetic turbulence and background
magnetic field in sheath-MC structure with diffusion coefficients calculated
with theoretical models, to reproduce the Fd associated with the ground-level
enhancement event on 2000 July 14 by solving the focused transport equation.
The sheath and MC are set to spherical caps that are portions of spherical
shells with enhanced background magnetic field. Besides, the magnetic
turbulence levels in sheath and MC are set to higher and lower than that in
ambient solar wind, respectively. In general, the simulation result conforms to
the main characteristics of the Fd observation, such as the pre-increase
precursor, amplitude, total recovery time, and the two-step decrease of the
flux at the arrival of sheath and MC. It is suggested that sheath played an
important role in the amplitude of Fd while MC contributed to the formation of
the second step decrease and prolonged the recovery time. It is also inferred
that both magnetic turbulence and background magnetic field in sheath-MC
structure are important for reproducing the observed two-step Fd.

industrial applications and in natural phenomena. Despite the relevance of the
problem, a satisfactory comprehension of the mechanisms involved has not still
be achieved because of the wide range of turbulent scales and the huge number
of droplets involved. In this context, we address a DNS of a turbulent jet
spray at relatively high Reynolds number, i.e. Re=10,000. We focus on the
effect of the jet Re on the evaporation process and the preferential
segregation of droplets, comparing the outcomes also with a DNS at lower
Reynolds number, Re = 6,000, in corresponding conditions. The problem is
addressed in the hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian framework employing the
point-droplet approximation. Detailed statistical analysis on both the gas and
dispersed phases are presented. We found that the droplet vaporization length
grows as the bulk Re is increased from Re = 6,000 to Re = 10,000 keeping other
conditions fixed. We attribute this result to the complex interaction between
the inertia of the droplets and the turbulent gaseous phase dynamics. In
particular, at higher Re, the slower droplet mass transfer is not able to
comply with the faster turbulent fluctuations of the mixing layer that tend to
fasten the process. We also found an intense droplet clustering which is
originated by entrainment of dry air in the mixing layer and intensified by the
small-scale clustering mechanism in the far-field region. We will show how
clustering creates a strongly heterogeneous droplet Lagrangian evolution. All
these aspects contribute to the Re dependence of the overall droplet
evaporation rate. Finally, we discuss the accuracy of the d-square law, often
used in spray modeling, for present cases. We found that using this law based
on environmental conditions the droplet evaporation rate is overestimated.

simulate the density curves of multiple types of components based on the
equilibria of gravitational and repulsive forces along the urban-rural
gradient. The forces from city center to components are determined by both the
city's attributes (land rent, population and people's environmental
preferences) and the components attributes (supply capacity, product
transportability and environmental impacts). The simulation for the
distribution curves of 22 types of components on the urban-rural gradient are a
good fit for the real-world data in cities. Based on the 4 typical types of
components, the model reveals a bottom-up self-organizing mechanism that is,
the patterns in city development are determined by the economic, ecological,
and social attributes of both cities and components. Based on the mechanism, we
predict the distribution curves of many types of components along with the
development of cities. The model provides a general tool for analyzing the
distribution of objects on the gradients.

compromised cognitive performances. The human body expresses the use of
cognitive resources through physiological responses when confronted with a
plethora of cognitive workload. This temporarily mobilizes additional resources
to deal with the workload at the cost of accelerated mental exhaustion. We
predict that recent developments in physiological sensing will increasingly
create user interfaces that are aware of the user's cognitive capacities, hence
able to intervene when high or low states of cognitive workload are detected.
Subsequently, we investigate suitable feedback modalities in a user-centric
design process which are desirable for cognitive assistance. We then
investigate different physiological sensing modalities to enable suitable
real-time assessments of cognitive workload. We provide evidence that the human
brain and eye gaze are sensitive to fluctuations in cognitive resting states.
We show that electroencephalography and eye tracking are reliable modalities to
assess mental workload during user interface operation. In the end, we present
applications that regulate cognitive workload in home and work setting,
investigate how cognitive workload can be visualized to the user, and show how
cognitive workload measurements can be used to predict the efficiency of
information intake through reading interfaces. Finally, we present our vision

ability to utilize cognitive workload for user interaction. Together with the
collected data sets, this thesis paves the way for methodical and technical

images are formed without detecting the light that interacted with the object

it is now of utmost importance to understand its resolution limits, in

theoretically and experimentally that the momentum correlation between the
detected and undetected photons governs the spatial resolution - a stronger
correlation results in a higher resolution. In our experiment, the momentum
correlation plays the dominating role in determining the resolution compared to
the effect of diffraction. We find that the resolution is determined by the
wavelength of the undetected light rather than the wavelength of the detected

resolution characterized by a wavelength much shorter than the detected

input sequences into a common semantic space as feature vectors upon which the

vectors projected from different domains tend to be indistinguishable. The
phenomenon, however, is often overlooked in existing matching models. As a
result, the feature vectors are constructed without any regularization, which
inevitably increases the difficulty of learning the downstream matching
functions. In this paper, we propose a novel match method tailored for text
matching in asymmetrical domains, called WD-Match. In WD-Match, a Wasserstein
distance-based regularizer is defined to regularize the features vectors
projected from different domains. As a result, the method enforces the feature
projection function to generate vectors such that those correspond to different
domains cannot be easily discriminated. The training process of WD-Match
amounts to a game that minimizes the matching loss regularized by the
Wasserstein distance. WD-Match can be used to improve different text matching
methods, by using the method as its underlying matching model. Four popular
text matching methods have been exploited in the paper. Experimental results
based on four publicly available benchmarks showed that WD-Match consistently

walker visits independently the nodes of a finite ergodic graph in a
discrete-time markovian walk governed by his specific transition matrix. With
this assumption, we first derive an upper bound for the reproduction numbers.
Then we assume that a walker is in one of the states: susceptible, infectious,
or recovered. An infectious walker remains infectious during a certain
characteristic time. If an infectious walker meets a susceptible one on the
same node there is a certain probability for the susceptible walker to get
infected. By implementing this hypothesis in computer simulations we study the

solution of the subsonic Navier-Stokes equation, are gaining increasing
popularity in the fluid dynamics community. One of the most popular among these
methods is the weakly-compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (WCSPH).
Since the dynamics of a single numerical particle is determined by fluid
dynamic transport equations, the particle per definition should represent a
homogeneous fluid element. However, it can be easily argued that a single
particle behaves only pseudo-Lagrangian as it is affected by volume partition
errors and can hardly adapt its shape to the actual fluid flow. Therefore, we
will assume that the kernel support provides a better representative of an
actual fluid element. By means of non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD)
analysis, we derive isothermal transport equations for a kernel-based fluid
element. The main discovery of the NEMD analysis is a molecular stress tensor
which may serve to explain current problems encountered in applications of
weakly-compressible particle-based discretization methods.

collaborators to share their local update of a common model, i.e. gradients

other collaborators. However, recent optimization-based gradient attacks show
that raw data can often be accurately recovered from gradients. It has been
shown that minimizing the Euclidean distance between true gradients and those
calculated from estimated data is often effective in fully recovering private

and when gradients can lead to unique recovery of original data. Our research
fills this gap by providing a closed-form recursive procedure to recover data
from gradients in deep neural networks. We name it Recursive Gradient Attack on

a monoidal derivator E. In parallel to the unenriched case, these
E-prederivators provide a framework for studying the constructions of enriched

  As a precursor to E-(pre)derivators, we study E-categories, which are
categories enriched over a bicategory Prof(E) associated to E. We prove a
number of fundamental results about E-categories, which parallel classical
results for enriched categories. In particular, we prove an E-category Yoneda

  In any E-category, we define notions of weighted homotopy limits and
colimits. We define E-derivators to be E-categories with a number of further
properties; in particular, they admit all weighted homotopy (co)limits. We show
that the closed E-modules studied by Groth, Ponto and Shulman give rise to
associated E-derivators, so that the theory of E-(pre)derivators captures these
examples. However, by working in the more general context of E-prederivators,
we can study weighted homotopy (co)limits in other settings, in particular in
settings where not all weighted homotopy (co)limits exist.
  Using the E-category Yoneda lemma, we prove a representability theorem for

characterized. Strain gradient effects associated with dislocation hardening
mechanisms elevate crack tip stresses relative to conventional plasticity. A
parametric study is conducted and differences with conventional plasticity
predictions are quantified. Moreover, the asymptotic nature of the crack tip
solution is investigated. The numerical results reveal that the singularity
order predicted by the first-order MSG theory is equal or higher to that of
linear elastic solids. Also, the crack tip field appears not to have a
separable solution. Moreover, contrarily to what has been shown in the higher
order version of MSG plasticity, the singularity order exhibits sensitivity to
the plastic material properties. Secondly, analytical and numerical approaches
are employed to formulate novel amplitude factors for strain gradient
plasticity. A generalized J-integral is derived and used to characterize a
nonlinear amplitude factor. A closed-form equation for the analytical stress
intensity factor is obtained. Amplitude factors are also derived by decomposing
the numerical solution for the crack tip stress field. Nonlinear amplitude
factor solutions are determined across a wide range of values for the material

fields in various environments, including star-forming regions. However, the
question of to what optical depth grain alignment still exists in a dense

formulae for the minimum size of aligned grains ($a_{\rm align}$) and
rotational disruption ($a_{\rm disr}$) by RAdiative Torques (RATs) as a
function of the local physical parameters within dense MCs. We first find the
analytical approximations for the radiation strength and the mean wavelength of
the attenuated radiation field in a dense MC without and with embedded stars
and then derive analytical formulae for $a_{\rm align}$ and $a_{\rm disr}$ as
functions of the visual extinction $A_{V}$ and the gas density. We find that
within a starless core of density $n_{\rm H}\sim 10^{5}\rm cm^{-3}$, grains of
size $a<0.25\mu m$ can be aligned up to $A_{V}\sim 5$ by RATs, whereas
micron-sized grains can still be aligned at $A_{V}\sim 50$. The increase in the
alignment size with $A_{V}$ can explain the presence of polarization holes
observed toward starless cores. For MCs with an embedded protostar, we find
that the efficiency of both alignment and rotational disruption increases
toward the protostar due to the increasing radiation strength. Such a
disruption effect results in the decrease of the polarization degree with
$A_{V}$ or emission intensity, which reproduces the popular polarization holes
observed toward the location of protostars. Finally, we derive the formula for
the maximum $A_{V}$ where grain alignment still exists in a starless core and
discuss its potential for constraining grain growth.

machine learning algorithm. However, it is well known that it suffers from the
curse of dimensionality, which is why in practice one often applies a kNN
classifier on top of a (pre-trained) feature transformation. From a theoretical
perspective, most, if not all theoretical results aimed at understanding the
kNN classifier are derived for the raw feature space. This leads to an emerging
gap between our theoretical understanding of kNN and its practical
applications. In this paper, we take a first step towards bridging this gap. We
provide a novel analysis on the convergence rates of a kNN classifier over
transformed features. This analysis requires in-depth understanding of the
properties that connect both the transformed space and the raw feature space.
More precisely, we build our convergence bound upon two key properties of the
transformed space: (1) safety -- how well can one recover the raw posterior
from the transformed space, and (2) smoothness -- how complex this recovery
function is. Based on our result, we are able to explain why some (pre-trained)
feature transformations are better suited for a kNN classifier than other. We
empirically validate that both properties have an impact on the kNN convergence
on 30 feature transformations with 6 benchmark datasets spanning from the

different values of the potential parameters and coupling strength using the
two-timing small-amplitude formalism. We show that the interaction sign,
attractive or repulsive, leads to different oscillon solutions, albeit with
similar characteristics, like the emergence of ""flat-top"" shapes. In the case
of attractive interactions, the oscillons can reach higher values of the energy
density and smaller values of the width. For repulsive interactions we identify
a threshold for the coupling strength, above which oscillons do not exist
within the two-timing small-amplitude framework. We extend the
Vakhitov-Kolokolov (V-K) stability criterion, which has been used to study
single-field oscillons, and show that the symmetry of the potential leads to
similar equations as in the single-field case, albeit with modified terms. We
explore the basin of attraction of stable oscillon solutions numerically to
test the validity of the V-K criterion and show that, depending on the initial
perturbation size, unstable oscillons can either completely disperse or relax
to the closest stable configuration. Similarly to the V-K criterion, the decay
rate and lifetime of two-field oscillons are found to be qualitatively and
quantitatively similar to their single-field counterparts. Finally, we
generalize our analysis to multi-field oscillons and show that the governing
equations for their shape and stability can be mapped to the ones arising in
the two-field case.

and implemented in a GPU parallel computing technique, and achieves a rather

investigate the nuclear isoscalar giant monopole resonances and isovector giant

reasonably the excitation energies of nuclear giant resonances, the full LBUU

strong correlation between the width of nuclear giant dipole resonance and the
NN elastic cross section suggests that the NN elastic scattering plays an
important role in nuclear collective dynamics, and the width of nuclear giant

numerical test for two spherical $^{60}$Ni and $^{90}$Zr nuclei shows that the
collective vibrational enhancement is mostly dominated by the quadrupole and
octupole excitations. This is the first microscopic model confirming such an
effect, which was phenomenologically predicted long time ago and widely
employed in several NLD models. In addition, the influence of collective
vibrational enhancement on nuclear thermodynamic quantities such as excitation

successive pulses, and the time interval ($\sim0.8$ ms) between the first and
third pulses coincides with that between the second and fourth pulses, which
can be interpreted as a neutron star (NS) spinning at a period of about $0.8$
ms. Although this period is shorter than the most rapidly rotating pulsar
currently known ($1.4$ ms), it is typical for a simulated massive NS formed
immediately after the coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNS). Therefore, a
BNS merger is a good candidate for the origin of this FRB if the periodicity is
real. We discuss the future implications that can be obtained if such a
periodicity is detected from FRBs simultaneously with gravitational waves (GW).
The remnant spin period $P_{\rm rem}$ inferred from the FRB observation is
unique information which is not readily obtained by current GW observations at
the post-merger phase. If combined with the mass of the merger remnant $M_{\rm
rem}$ inferred from GW data, it would set a new constraint on the equation of
state of nuclear matter. Furthermore, the post-merger quantity $P_{\rm
rem}/M_{\rm rem}$, or the tidal deformability of the merger remnant, is closely
related to the binary tidal deformability parameter $\Lambda$ of NSs before
they merge, and a joint FRB-GW observation will establish a new limit on
$\Lambda$. Thus, if $\Lambda$ is also well measured by GW data, a comparison
between these two will provide further insights into the nature of nuclear

used in the CNC analysis, in the $yy$-PS modeling. This provides a systematic
method, based mainly on SZ observables, for obtaining two complementary
$y$-maps, one incorporating detected/resolved clusters and the other relying
only on diffuse/unresolved SZ contributions. We use the catalogue of clusters
obtained in the \Planck CNC analysis to define the completeness function
linking these two $y$-maps. The split depends on the chosen signal-to-noise
detection threshold, which we vary in our discussion. We carefully propagate
the effect of completeness cuts on the non-Gaussian error contributions in the
$yy$-PS analysis, highlighting the benefits of masking massive clusters. Our
analysis of the \Planck $yy$-PS for the unresolved component yields a mass bias
of $b=0.15\pm0.04$, consistent with the standard value ($b\approx0.2$), in
comparison to $b=0.4\pm 0.05$ for the total $yy$-PS. We find indications for
this drift being driven by the CIB-tSZ cross correlation, which dominantly
originates from clusters in the resolved component of the $y$-map. Another
possible explanation is the presence of a mass-dependent bias, which has been
theoretically motivated and can be quantified with our novel method. We
furthermore find first hints for the presence of the 2-halo terms in the
$yy$-PS. Finally, the proposed method provides a new framework for combining
the complementary information of the CNC and PS analyses in upcoming SZ

performance of deep neural networks and led to state-of-the-art results in
computer vision. However, state-of-the-art data augmentation strongly distorts
training images, leading to a disparity between examples seen during training
and inference. In this work, we explore a recently proposed training paradigm
in order to correct for this disparity: using an auxiliary BatchNorm for the
potentially out-of-distribution, strongly augmented images. Our experiments
then focus on how to define the BatchNorm parameters that are used at
evaluation. To eliminate the train-test disparity, we experiment with using the
batch statistics defined by clean training images only, yet surprisingly find
that this does not yield improvements in model performance. Instead, we
investigate using BatchNorm parameters defined by weak augmentations and find
that this method significantly improves the performance of common image
classification benchmarks such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. We then
explore a fundamental trade-off between accuracy and robustness coming from
using different BatchNorm parameters, providing greater insight into the
benefits of data augmentation on model performance.

awareness of serious problems with NHST as it is typically used, and hence to
proposals to limit the use of NHST techniques, to abandon these techniques and
move to alternative statistical approaches, or even to ban the use of NHST
entirely. These proposals are premature, because the observed problems with
NHST all arise as a consequence of a contingent and in many cases incorrect
choice: that of NHST testing against point-form nulls. We show that testing
against distributional, rather than point-form, nulls is better motivated
mathematically and experimentally, and that the use of distributional nulls
addresses many problems with the standard point-form NHST approach. We also
show that use of distributional nulls allows a form of null hypothesis testing
that takes into account both the statistical significance of a given result and
the probability of replication of that result in a new experiment. Rather than
abandoning NHST, we should use the NHST approach in its more general form, with

part considers three tensor models in three dimensions, a Fermionic quartic
with tensors of rank-3 and two Bosonic sextic, of ranks 3 and 5. We rely upon
the large-$N$ melonic expansion of tensor models. For the first model,
invariant under $U(N)^3$, we obtain the RG flow of the two melonic couplings
and the vacuum phase diagram, from a reformulation with a diagonalizable matrix
intermediate field. The discrete chiral symmetry breaks spontaneously and we
compare with the three-dimensional Gross-Neveu model. Beyond the massless
$U(N)^3$ symmetric phase, we also observe a massive phase of same symmetry and
another where the symmetry breaks into $U(N^2)\times U(N/2)\times U(N/2)$. A
matrix model invariant under $U(N)\times U(N^2)$, with close properties, is
also studied. For the other models, with symmetry groups $U(N)^3$ and $O(N)^5$,
a non-melonic coupling (the ""wheel"") with an optimal scaling in $N$ drives us
to a generalized melonic expansion. The kinetic terms are taken of short- and
long-range, and we analyze perturbatively, at large-$N$, the RG flows of the
sextic couplings up to four loops. Only the rank-3 model displays non-trivial
fixed points (two real Wilson-Fisher-like in the short-range case and a line of
fixed points in the other). We finally obtain the real conformal dimensions of
the primary bilinear operators. In the second part, we establish the first
results of perturbative multi-scale renormalization for a quartic scalar field
on critical Galton-Watson trees, with a long-range kinetic term. At
criticality, an emergent infinite spine provides a space of effective dimension
$4/3$ on which to compute averaged correlation fonctions. This approach
formalizes the notion of a QFT on a random geometry. We use known probabilistic
bounds on the heat-kernel on a random graph reviewed in detail.

exposure of another person have been modelled and quantified. Start is a
COVID-19 illness progression model specifying rising emissions by an infected
person: the human virion factory. The first route covers closed spaces, with an
emission, concentration, and decay model quantifying exposure. A next set of
routes covers person-to-person contacts mostly in open spaces, modelling the
spatial distribution of exhales towards inhalation. These models also cover
incidental exposures, like coughs and sneezes, and exposure through objects.
Routes through animal contacts, excrements, and food, have not been quantified.
Potential exposures differ by six orders of magnitude. Closed rooms, even with
reasonably (VR 2) to good (VR 5) ventilation, constitute the major exposure
risks. Close person-to-person contacts of longer duration create two orders of
magnitude lower exposure risks. Open spaces may create risks an order of
magnitude lower again. Burst of larger droplets may cause a common cold but not
viral pneumonia as the virions in such droplets cannot reach the alveoli.
Fomites have not shown viable viruses in hospitals, let alone infections.
Infection by animals might be possible, as by cats and ferrets kept as pets.
These results indicate priority domains for individual and collective measures.
The wide divergence in outcomes indicates robustness to most modelling and data
improvements, hardly leading to major changes in relative exposure potentials.

introduce a family of fully spin-$SU(2)$ and lattice-$C_{4v}$ symmetric on-site
tensors (of bond dimensions $D=4$ or $D=7$) and a plaquette-based
Trotter-Suzuki decomposition of the imaginary-time evolution operator. A
variational optimization is performed on the plaquettes, using a full (for
$D=4$) or simple (for $D=7$) environment obtained from the single-site Corner
Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group fixed point. The method is benchmarked by
a comparison to quantum Monte Carlo in the thermodynamic limit. Although the
iPEPO spin correlation length starts to deviate from the exact exponential
growth for inverse-temperature $\beta \gtrsim 2$, the behavior of various
observables turns out to be quite accurate once plotted w.r.t the inverse
correlation length. We also find that a direct $T=0$ variational energy
optimization provides results in full agreement with the
$\beta\rightarrow\infty$ limit of finite-temperature data, hence validating the
imaginary-time evolution procedure. Extension of the method to frustrated
models is described and preliminary results are shown.

spectral CT and material decomposition. There are several approaches to
modulate the sensitivity of the imaging system to obtain the different spectral
channels required for decomposition. Spectral CT technologies that enable this
varied sensitivity include source kV-switching, dual-layer detectors, and
source-side filtering (e.g., tiled spatial-spectral filters). In this work, we
use an advanced physical model to simulate these three spectral CT strategies
as well as hybrid acquisitions using all combinations of two or three
strategies. We apply model-based material decomposition to a water-iodine
phantom with iodine concentrations from 0.1 to 5.0 mg/mL. We present bias-noise
plots for the different combinations of spectral techniques and show that
combined approaches permit diversity in spectral sensitivity and improve low
concentration imaging performance relative to the those strategies applied
individually. Better ability to estimate low concentrations of contrast agent
has the potential to reduce risks associated with contrast administration (by
lowering dosage) or to extend imaging applications into targets with much lower

than 200 billions samples (pixels); it is varied, covering 16 conurbations in
France, with various climates, different landscapes, and urban as well as

applications in kidney exchange and online dating. In this problem, we are
given an undirected graph. Each edge is assigned a known, independent
probability of existence and a positive weight (or profit). We must probe an
edge to discover whether or not it exists. Each node is assigned a positive
integer called a timeout (or a patience). On this random graph we are executing
a process, which probes the edges one-by-one and gradually constructs a
matching. The process is constrained in two ways. First, if a probed edge
exists, it must be added irrevocably to the matching (the query-commit model).
Second, the timeout of a node $v$ upper-bounds the number of edges incident to
$v$ that can be probed. The goal is to maximize the expected weight of the
constructed matching.
  For this problem, Bansal et al. (Algorithmica 2012) provided a

  In the context of open non-uniformly expanding maps (a special case of

existence of finitely many ergodic equilibrium states for the so-called
hyperbolic potentials and also for the so-called geometric potentials $\phi_{t}

for measurable potentials). Moreover, for the same class of potentials, we show
the existence of conformal measures. We prove uniqueness of equilibrium state
when the map is strongly topologically transitive and backward separated.
  The technique consists in using an inducing scheme in a finite Markov

increasingly popular, significant concerns on the potential discrimination
during the AI decision-making process have been observed. For example, the
distribution of predictions is usually biased and dependents on the sensitive
attributes (e.g., gender and ethnicity). Numerous approaches have therefore
been proposed to develop decision-making systems that are
discrimination-conscious by-design, which are typically batch-based and require
the simultaneous availability of all the training data for model learning.
However, in the real-world, the data streams usually come on the fly which
requires the model to process each input data once ""on arrival"" and without the
need for storage and reprocessing. In addition, the data streams might also
evolve over time, which further requires the model to be able to simultaneously
adapt to non-stationary data distributions and time-evolving bias patterns,
with an effective and robust trade-off between accuracy and fairness. In this
paper, we propose a novel framework of online decision tree with fairness in
the data stream with possible distribution drifting. Specifically, first, we
propose two novel fairness splitting criteria that encode the data as well as
possible, while simultaneously removing dependence on the sensitive attributes,
and further adapts to non-stationary distribution with fine-grained control
when needed. Second, we propose two fairness decision tree online growth
algorithms that fulfills different online fair decision-making requirements.
Our experiments show that our algorithms are able to deal with discrimination
in massive and non-stationary streaming environments, with a better trade-off

and solar, which produce intermittent power, storage is needed to transfer
power from times of peak generation to peak demand. This may require the
storage of power for hours, days, or months. One solution that offers the
potential of scaling to nation-sized grids is the conversion of renewable
energy to other fuels, such as hydrogen or methane. To be widely adopted, this
process requires cost-effective solutions to running electrochemical reactions.
An open challenge is finding low-cost electrocatalysts to drive these reactions
at high rates. Through the use of quantum mechanical simulations (density
functional theory), new catalyst structures can be tested and evaluated.
Unfortunately, the high computational cost of these simulations limits the
number of structures that may be tested. The use of machine learning may
provide a method to efficiently approximate these calculations, leading to new
approaches in finding effective electrocatalysts. In this paper, we provide an
introduction to the challenges in finding suitable electrocatalysts, how
machine learning may be applied to the problem, and the use of the Open
Catalyst Project OC20 dataset for model training.

dynamics (CFD) domain are viewed as point clouds and used as inputs to a neural
network based on the PointNet architecture, which learns an end-to-end mapping
between spatial positions and CFD quantities. Using our approach, (i) the
network inherits desirable features of unstructured meshes (e.g., fine and
coarse point spacing near the object surface and in the far field,
respectively), which minimizes network training cost; (ii) object geometry is
accurately represented through vertices located on object boundaries, which
maintains boundary smoothness and allows the network to detect small changes
between geometries; and (iii) no data interpolation is utilized for creating

overcome the $n\log n$ barrier when the keys to be sorted are short.
Specifically, we prove that there is a circuit with $(k + w) \cdot O(n k) \cdot

development of countries in Africa. Leveraging on the fourth industrial
revolution, Africa can achieve accelerated development in health care services,
educational systems and socio-economic infrastructures. While a number of
conceptual frameworks have been proposed for the African continent, many have
discounted the Cloud infrastructure used for data storage and processing, as
well as the underlying network infrastructure upon which such frameworks would
be built. This work therefore presents a continental network model for
interconnecting nations in Africa through its data centres. The proposed model
is based on a multilayer network engineering approach, which first groups
African countries into clusters of data centres using a hybrid combination of
clustering techniques; then utilizes Ant Colony Optimization with Stench
Pheromone, that is modified to support variable evaporation rates, to find the
ideal network path(s) across the clusters and the continent as a whole. The
propsoed model takes into consideration the geo-spatial location, population
sizes, data centre counts and intercontinental submarine cable landings of each
African country, when clustering and routing. For bench-marking purposes, the
path selection algorithm was tested on both the obtained clusters and African
Union's regional clusters.

high-speed PAM technology often sacrifices spatial sampling density (i.e.,
undersampling) for increased imaging speed over a large field-of-view. Deep
learning (DL) methods have recently been used to improve sparsely sampled PAM
images; however, these methods often require time-consuming pre-training and
large training dataset with ground truth. Here, we propose the use of deep
image prior (DIP) to improve the image quality of undersampled PAM images.
Unlike other DL approaches, DIP requires neither pre-training nor fully-sampled
ground truth, enabling its flexible and fast implementation on various imaging
targets. Our results have demonstrated substantial improvement in PAM images
with as few as 1.4$\%$ of the fully sampled pixels on high-speed PAM. Our
approach outperforms interpolation, is competitive with pre-trained supervised
DL method, and is readily translated to other high-speed, undersampling imaging
modalities.

by the theory of elasticity and does not require labeled data for training.
Results show that the proposed method can learn the hidden elasticity of solids
accurately and is robust when it comes to noisy and missing measurements. A
probable elasticity distribution for areas without measurements may also be
reconstructed by the neural network based on the elasticity distribution in
nearby regions. The neural network learns the hidden elasticity of solids as a
function of positions and thus it can generate elasticity images with an
arbitrary resolution. This feature is applied to create super-resolution
elasticity images in this study. We demonstrate that the neural network can
also learn the hidden physics when strain and elasticity distributions are both

method for searching databases of biological sequences. BLAST compares
sequences via similarity defined by a weighted edit distance, which results in
it being computationally expensive. As opposed to working with edit distance, a
vector similarity approach can be accelerated substantially using modern
hardware or hashing techniques. Such an approach would require fixed-length
embeddings for biological sequences. There has been recent interest in learning
fixed-length protein embeddings using deep learning models under the hypothesis
that the hidden layers of supervised or semi-supervised models could produce
potentially useful vector embeddings. We consider transformer (BERT) protein
language models that are pretrained on the TrEMBL data set and learn
fixed-length embeddings on top of them with contextual lenses. The embeddings
are trained to predict the family a protein belongs to for sequences in the
Pfam database. We show that for nearest-neighbor family classification,
pretraining offers a noticeable boost in performance and that the corresponding
learned embeddings are competitive with BLAST. Furthermore, we show that the
raw transformer embeddings, obtained via static pooling, do not perform well on
nearest-neighbor family classification, which suggests that learning embeddings

alternative to fine-tuning.

allows a set of participating agents to collaboratively train a model without

privacy is desired. However, it has been observed that the performance of FL is
closely tied with the local data distributions of agents. Particularly, in
settings where local data distributions vastly differ among agents, FL performs
rather poorly with respect to the centralized training. To address this
problem, we hypothesize the reasons behind the performance degradation, and
develop some techniques to address these reasons accordingly. In this work, we
identify four simple techniques that can improve the performance of trained
models without incurring any additional communication overhead to FL, but
rather, some light computation overhead either on the client, or the
server-side. In our experimental analysis, combination of our techniques
improved the validation accuracy of a model trained via FL by more than 12%

Our work thus focuses on optimizing the computational cost of fine-tuning for
document classification. We achieve this by complementary learning of both
topic and language models in a unified framework, named TopicBERT. This
significantly reduces the number of self-attention operations - a main
performance bottleneck. Consequently, our model achieves a 1.4x ($\sim40\%$)

give an enumerator for a language. This so-called $W$-index allows for naming
arbitrary computably enumerable languages, with the drawback that even the
membership problem is undecidable. In this paper we use a different system
which allows for naming arbitrary decidable languages, namely programs for
characteristic functions (called $C$-indices). These indices have the drawback
that it is now not decidable whether a given hypothesis is even a legal
$C$-index.
  In this first analysis of learning with $C$-indices, we give a structured
account of the learning power of various restrictions employing $C$-indices,
also when compared with $W$-indices. We establish a hierarchy of learning power
depending on whether $C$-indices are required (a) on all outputs; (b) only on
outputs relevant for the class to be learned and (c) only in the limit as
final, correct hypotheses. Furthermore, all these settings are weaker than
learning with $W$-indices (even when restricted to classes of computable
languages). We analyze all these questions also in relation to the mode of data
presentation.
  Finally, we also ask about the relation of semantic versus syntactic
convergence and derive the map of pairwise relations for these two kinds of
convergence coupled with various forms of data presentation.

been restricted to examining ensembles of synthetic networks generated by
canonical models from the Network Science literature, which do not plausibly
represent real road networks. Furthermore disparate ranges of parameter
settings for demand and supply structure are often used, making it difficult to
compare one study with another.
  To address these deficiencies, this paper proposes an experimental framework
for the design of numerical investigations to study how network performance
varies with respect to the structural properties of urban road networks. The
key step within this experimental framework is the generation of a spectrum of
ensembles of synthetic networks, which vary with respect to a single aspect of
network structure and which adhere to plausibility constraints that ensure
relevance to real urban road networks. This paper then demonstrates the
application of this experimental framework to an investigation of how two
performance indicators; the average link Volume-to-Capacity ratio and the Price
of Anarchy, vary with respect to the density of travel demand, and the size,
density and connectivity of network infrastructure. In so doing, several key
challenges of such investigations are identified, with respect to the
computational burden of the experiments and the need for empirical data on some
important aspects of network structure such as the distribution of capacity.
