the velocity of light to vary as a function of the scale factor $c\propto
a^{-\zeta}$, as initiated by Barrow [1]. The variation in the velocity of light
creates an effect akin to the refraction phenomenon which occurs for a wave
traveling in a medium with varying speed of wave. We elucidate the role of the
local scale of gravitationally-bound regions in assisting the refraction effect
to manifest. The refraction effect alters the redshift formulae (Lemaitre,
distance-vs-z, luminosity distance-vs-z) and warrants a new analysis of the
Pantheon dataset. Upon a reformulation of the distance-redshift relations, we
achieve a high-quality fit of the Pantheon dataset to the variable light speed
approach; the fit is as robust as that obtained in the standard $\Lambda CDM$
model. We find that the Pantheon dataset is consistent with the variable light
speed of the functional form: $a\propto t^{\mu}$ and $c\propto a^{1-1/\mu}$
with (i) the cosmic age $t_{0}\approx 13.9$ Gy as a free parameter, while $\mu$
is unspecified; and (ii) a monotonic variation in the local scale for
gravitationally-bound objects (applicable to the emission sources and the Solar
System-based apparatus/observer). Due to the agent in (ii), the high-z portion
of the Pantheon dataset would produce an ""effective"" $H_{0}$ estimate which is
10 percent lower than the $H_{0}$ estimate obtained from the low-z portion of
the dataset. We offer an alternative interpretation of the accelerating
expansion by way of variable speed of light, and as a by-product of the agent
uncovered in (ii), a tentative suggestion toward ""resolving"" the ongoing
tension in the Hubble constant estimates.

  Intention to Continuous Trajectory",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the challenges to reduce the gap between the machine and the human
level driving is how to endow the system with the learning capacity to deal
with the coupled complexity of environments, intentions, and dynamics. In this
paper, we propose a hierarchical driving model with explicit model of
continuous intention and continuous dynamics, which decouples the complexity in
the observation-to-action reasoning in the human driving data. Specifically,
the continuous intention module takes the route planning map obtained by GPS
and IMU, perception from a RGB camera and LiDAR as input to generate a
potential map encoded with obstacles and intentions being expressed as grid
based potentials. Then, the potential map is regarded as a condition, together
with the current dynamics, to generate a continuous trajectory as output by a
continuous function approximator network, whose derivatives can be used for
supervision without additional parameters. Finally, we validate our method on
both datasets and simulator, demonstrating that our method has higher
prediction accuracy of displacement and velocity and generates smoother
trajectories. The method is also deployed on the real vehicle with loop
latency, validating its effectiveness. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to produce the driving trajectory using a continuous function
approximator network.

equivalent if there are infinitely many vertex-disjoint paths between them in

  Halin conjectured that the end degree can be characterised in terms of
certain typical ray configurations, which would generalise his famous
\emph{grid theorem}. In particular, every end of regular uncountable degree
$\kappa$ would contain a \emph{star of rays}, i.e.\ a configuration consisting
of a central ray $R$ and $\kappa$ neighbouring rays $(R_i \colon i < \kappa)$
all disjoint from each other and each $R_i$ sending a family of infinitely many
disjoint paths to $R$ so that paths from distinct families only meet in $R$.
  We show that Halin's conjecture fails for end degree $ \aleph_1$, holds for
$\aleph_2,\aleph_3,\ldots,\aleph_\omega$, fails for $ \aleph_{\omega+1}$, and
is undecidable (in ZFC) for the next $\aleph_{\omega+n}$ with $n \in

a fundamental challenge in distributed radio frequency system cooperation -
inter-node phase alignment - which must be accomplished wirelessly, and is
particularly challenging when the nodes are in relative motion. We present a
solution to this problem that is based on a novel combined high-accuracy
ranging and frequency transfer technique. Using this approach, we present the
design of the first fully wireless distributed system operating at the
wavelength level. We demonstrate the system in the first open-loop coherent
distributed beamforming experiment. Internode range estimation to support phase
alignment was performed using a two-tone stepped frequency waveform with a
single pulse, while a two-tone waveform was used for frequency synchronization,
where the oscillator of a secondary node was disciplined to the primary node.
In this concept, secondary nodes are equipped with an adjunct self-mixing
circuit that is able to extract the reference frequency from the captured
synchronization waveform. The approach was implemented on a two-node dynamic
system using Ettus X310 software-defined radios, with coherent beamforming at
1.5 GHz. We demonstrate distributed beamforming with greater than 90% of the
maximum possible coherent gain throughout the displacement of the secondary

stellar disk of our Galaxy to be warped and that this imparts a strong
signature on the kinematics of stars beyond the solar neighborhood. However,
due to the limitation of accurate distance estimates, many attempts to explore
the extent of these Galactic features have generally been restricted to a
volume near the Sun. By combining Gaia DR2 astrometric solution, StarHorse
distance and stellar abundances from the APOGEE survey, we present the most
detailed and radially expansive study yet of the vertical and radial motions of
stars in the Galactic disk. We map stellar velocity with respect to their
Galactocentric radius, angular momentum, and azimuthal angle and assess their
relation to the warp. A decrease in vertical velocity is discovered at
Galactocentric radius $R=13\ \text{kpc}$ and angular momentum $L_z=2800\
\text{kpc}\ \text{km}\ \text{s}^{-1}$. Smaller ripples in vertical and radial
velocity are also discovered superposed on the main trend. We also discovered
that trends in the vertical velocity with azimuthal angle are not symmetric
about the peak, suggesting the warp to be lopsided. To explain the global trend
in vertical velocity, we built a simple analytical model of the Galactic warp.
Our best fit yields a starting radius of $8.87^{+0.08}_{-0.09}\ \text{kpc}$ and
precession rate of $13.57^{+0.20}_{-0.18}\ \text{km}\ \text{s}^{-1}\
\text{kpc}^{-1}$. These parameters remain consistent across stellar age groups,
a result that supports the notion that the warp is the result of an external,
gravitationally induced phenomenon.

warped-like product is regarded as a generalization of multiply-warped product
manifolds, by allowing the fiber metric to be non block diagonal. For some
special cases, we present explicit example of $(3+3+2)$ warped-like product
manifolds with $Spin(7)$ holonomy of the form $M=F\times B$, where the base $B$
is a two dimensional Riemannian manifold, and the fibre $F$ is of the form
$F=F_1\times F_2$ where $F_i$'s $(i=1,2)$ are Riemannian $3$-manifolds.
Additionally an explicit example of $(3+3+1)$ warped-like product manifold with

of the presence of the structural disturbances and consists in two main

self-coupling, the coupling of the inhomogeneities with one another. Two
particular cases of deviation from homogeneity are considered in more details:
the case of non-interacting inhomogeneities and that of interacting
inhomogeneities. The effects on the small angle scattering (SAS) due to

common methods for tackling this supervised learning problem. Nonetheless,
interpretation of these models remains sometimes difficult, and solutions based

identification of the most informative wavelengths. Unfortunately, for some
delicate applications like food authenticity, mislabeled and adulterated

Motivated by these issues, the present paper proposes a robust model-based
method that simultaneously performs variable selection, outliers and label

with three agri-food spectroscopic studies, where several forms of

time. In the past, they were postulated using a generalization of the symmetry
properties of the Riemann tensor (curl on each index of a totally symmetric
rank-$n$ field for each spin-$n$). For this reason they are sometimes referred
to as the generalized 'Riemann' tensors. In this article, a method for deriving
these curvature tensors from first principles is presented; the derivation is
completed without any a priori knowledge of the existence of the Riemann
tensors or the curvature tensors of higher-spin gauge theories. To perform this
derivation, a recently developed procedure for deriving exactly gauge invariant
Lagrangian densities from quadratic combinations of $N$ order of derivatives
and $M$ rank of tensor potential is applied to the $N = M = n$ case under the
spin-$n$ gauge transformations. This procedure uniquely yields the Lagrangian
for classical electrodynamics in the $N = M = 1$ case and the Lagrangian for
higher derivative gravity (`Riemann' and `Ricci' squared terms) in the $N = M =
2$ case. It is proven here by direct calculation for the $N = M = 3$ case that
the unique solution to this procedure is the spin-3 curvature tensor and its
contractions. The spin-4 curvature tensor is also uniquely derived for the $N =
M = 4$ case. In other words, it is proven here that, for the most general
linear combination of scalars built from $N$ derivatives and $M$ rank of tensor
potential, up to $N=M=4$, there exists a unique solution to the resulting
system of linear equations as the contracted spin-$n$ curvature tensors.
Conjectures regarding the solutions to the higher spin-$n$ $N = M = n$ are
discussed.

model observables using free field techniques. We attempt to derive and clarify
these rules using standard techniques of QFT. We begin with a careful
examination of the timelike linear dilaton. Although the background charge $Q$
breaks the scalar field's continuous shift symmetry, the exponential of the
action is invariant under a discrete shift because $Q$ is imaginary. Gauging
this symmetry makes the dilaton compact and introduces winding modes into the
spectrum. One of these winding operators corresponds to the BRST current first
introduced by Felder. The cohomology of this BRST charge isolates the
irreducible representations of the Virasoro algebra within the linear dilaton
Fock space, and the supertrace in the BRST complex reproduces the minimal model
partition function. The model at the radius $R=\sqrt{pp'}$ has two marginal
operators corresponding to the Dotsenko-Fateev screening charges. Deforming by
them, we obtain a model that might be called a ""BRST quotiented compact
timelike Liouville theory."" The Hamiltonian of the zero-mode quantum mechanics
is not Hermitian, but it is $PT$-symmetric and exactly solvable. Its
eigenfunctions have support on an infinite number of plane waves, suggesting an
infinite reduction in the number of independent states in the full QFT.
Applying conformal perturbation theory to the exponential interactions
reproduces the Coulomb gas calculations of minimal model correlators. In
contrast to spacelike Liouville, these resonance correlators are finite because
the zero mode is compact. We comment on subtleties regarding the reflection
operator identification, as well as naive violations of truncation in
correlators with multiple reflection operators inserted. This work is part of

hide their hydrodynamic traces from predators. A group of
windward-suction-leeward-blowing (WSLB) actuators are adopted to control the
wake of a circular cylinder submerged in a uniform flow. An array of velocity
sensors are deployed in the near wake to provide feedback signals. Through the
data-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL), effective control strategies are
trained for the WSLB actuation to mitigate the cylinder's hydrodynamic
signatures, i.e., strong shears and periodically shed vortices. Only a 0.29%
deficit in streamwise velocity is detected, which is a 99.5% reduction from the
uncontrolled value. The same control strategy is found to be also effective
when the cylinder undergoes transverse vortex-induced vibration (VIV). The
findings from this study can shed some lights on the design and operation of
underwater structures and robotics to achieve hydrodynamic stealth.

variability in proliferative potential and resistance to infection among

phenotype and the presence of a fitness trade-off between resistance to
infection and proliferative potential are incorporated into the model. The
model comprises an ODE for the number of infected individuals that is coupled
with a partial integrodifferential equation for the population density of
susceptibles through an integral term. The expression for the basic
reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$ is derived, the disease-free and endemic
equilibrium of the model are characterised and a threshold theorem is proved.
Analytical results are integrated with numerical simulations of a calibrated
version of the model based on the results of artificial selection experiments
in a host-parasite system. The results of our mathematical study disentangle
the impact of different evolutionary parameters on the spread of infectious
diseases and the consequent phenotypic adaption of susceptible individuals. In
particular, these results provide a theoretical basis for the observation that
infectious diseases exerting stronger selective pressures on susceptibles and
being characterised by higher infection rates are more likely to spread.
Moreover, our results indicate that spontaneous phenotypic changes in
proliferative potential and resistance to infection can either promote or
prevent the spread of diseases depending on the strength of selection acting on
susceptible individuals prior to infection. Finally, we demonstrate that, when
an endemic equilibrium is established, higher levels of resistance to infection
and lower degrees of phenotypic heterogeneity are to be expected in the
presence of infections which are characterised by lower rates of death and
exert stronger selective pressures.

challenging for real-world applications (e.g., electric vehicle). In this
paper, the estimation of SOH (i.e., capacity fading) under partial discharge
with different starting and final State of Charge (SOC) levels is investigated.
The challenge lies in the fact that partial discharge truncates the data
available for SOH estimation, thereby leading to the loss or distortion of
common SOH indicators. To address this challenge associated with partial
discharge, we explore the convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract
indicators for both SOH and changes in SOH ($\Delta$SOH) between two successive
charge/discharge cycles. The random forest algorithm is then adopted to produce
the final SOH estimate by exploiting the indicators from the CNNs. Performance
evaluation is conducted using the partial discharge data with different SOC
ranges created from a fast-discharging dataset. The proposed approach is
compared with i) a differential analysis-based approach and ii) two CNN-based
approaches using only SOH and $\Delta$SOH indicators, respectively. Through
comparison, the proposed approach demonstrates improved estimation accuracy and
robustness. Sensitivity analysis of the CNN and random forest models further

uniformity, it is computationally challenging to be calculated accurately. We
introduce the concept of directed Discrepancy based on which we have developed
an algorithm, called Directional Discrepancy, that can offer accurate

calculating the Cap Discrepancy of a specific distribution, Polar Coordinates,

real-space, and enhance the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) peak. For this
purpose, we introduce a new implementation of eFAM that accounts for selection
effects, survey footprint, and galaxy bias. We use the reconstructed BAO peak
to measure the angular diameter distance, D_A(z)r^{fid}_s/r_s, and the Hubble
parameter, H(z)r_s/r^{fid}_s, normalized to the sound horizon scale for a
fiducial cosmology r^{fid}_s, at the mean redshift of the sample z=0.38,
obtaining D_A(z=0.38)r^{fid}_s/r_s=1090 +/- 29 (Mpc)^{-1}, and
H(z=0.38)r_s}/r^{fid}_s=83 +/- 3 (km s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}), in agreement with
previous measurements on the same dataset. The validation tests, performed
using 400 publicly available SDSS-DR12 mock catalogues, reveal that eFAM
performs well in reconstructing the 2PCF down to separations of 25h^{-1}Mpc$,
i.e. well into the non-linear regime. Besides, eFAM successfully removes the
anisotropies due to redshift-space distortion at all redshifts including that
of the survey, allowing us to decrease the number of free parameters in the
model and fit the full-shape of the back-in-time reconstructed 2PCF well beyond
the BAO peak. Recovering the real-space 2PCF, eFAM improves the precision on
the estimates of the fitting parameters. When compared with the
no-reconstruction case, eFAM reduces the uncertainty of the Alcock-Paczynski
distortion parameters of about 40% and that on the non-linear damping scale of
about 70%. These results show that eFAM can be successfully applied to existing
redshift galaxy catalogues and should be considered as a reconstruction tool
for next-generation surveys alternative to popular methods based on the

materials has flourished a new endeavour of fundamental problems in magnetism
as well as potential applications in computing, sensing and storage
technologies. Of particular interest are antiferromagnets, which due to their
intrinsic antiferromagnetic exchange coupling show several advantages in
relation to ferromagnets such as robustness against external magnetic
perturbations. This property is one of the cornerstones of antiferromagnets and
implies that information stored in antiferromagnetic domains is invisible to
applied magnetic fields preventing it from being erased or manipulated. Here we
show that, despite this fundamental understanding, the magnetic domains of
recently discovered vdW MnPS3 antiferromagnet can be controlled via external
magnetic fields and currents. We realize ultrafast domain-wall dynamics with
velocities up to 1500 m/s and 3000 m/s respectively to a broad range of fields
and current densities. Both domain wall dynamics are determined by the edge
terminations which generated uncompensated spins following the underlying
symmetry of the honeycomb structure. We find that edge atoms belonging to
different magnetic sublattices function as geometrical constrictions preventing
the displacement of the wall, whereas having atoms of the same sublattice at
both edges of the material allows for the field-driven domain wall motion which
is only limited by the spin-flop transition of the antiferromagnet beyond 25 T.
Conversely, electric currents can induce motion of domain walls in most of the
edges except those where the two sublattices are present at the borders (e.g.
armchair edges). Our results indicate that the implementation of 2D vdW
antiferromagnets in real applications requires the engineering of the layer
edges which enables an unprecedented functional feature in ultrathin device

research. For decades, lexical matching signal has dominated the ad-hoc

mismatch problem. Recently, Dense Retrieval (DR) technique has been proposed to
alleviate these limitations by capturing the deep semantic relationship between
queries and documents. The training of most existing Dense Retrieval models
relies on sampling negative instances from the corpus to optimize a pairwise
loss function. Through investigation, we find that this kind of training
strategy is biased and fails to optimize full retrieval performance effectively
and efficiently. To solve this problem, we propose a Learning To Retrieve
(LTRe) training technique. LTRe constructs the document index beforehand. At
each training iteration, it performs full retrieval without negative sampling
and then updates the query representation model parameters. Through this
process, it teaches the DR model how to retrieve relevant documents from the
entire corpus instead of how to rerank a potentially biased sample of
documents. Experiments in both passage retrieval and document retrieval tasks
show that: 1) in terms of effectiveness, LTRe significantly outperforms all
competitive sparse and dense baselines. It even gains better performance than
the BM25-BERT cascade system under reasonable latency constraints. 2) in terms
of training efficiency, compared with the previous state-of-the-art DR method,
LTRe provides more than 170x speed-up in the training process. Training with a

activities including the way people communicate, move, provision themselves, or

in Austria (15% of the population) across the first phase of the COVID-19
crisis, we quantify gender-specific patterns of communication intensity,
mobility, and circadian rhythms. We show the resilience of behavioral patterns
with respect to the shock imposed by a strict nation-wide lock-down that
Austria experienced in the beginning of the crisis with severe implications on
public and private life. We find drastic differences in gender-specific
responses during the different phases of the pandemic. After the lock-down
gender differences in mobility and communication patterns increased massively,
while sleeping patterns and circadian rhythms tend to synchronize. In
particular, women had fewer but longer phone calls than men during the
lock-down. Mobility declined massively for both genders, however, women tend to
restrict their movement stronger than men. Women showed a stronger tendency to
avoid shopping centers and more men frequented recreational areas. After the
lock-down, males returned back to normal quicker than women; young age-cohorts
return much quicker. Differences are driven by the young and adolescent
population. An age stratification highlights the role of retirement on
behavioral differences. We find that the length of a day of men and women is
reduced by one hour. We discuss the findings in the light of gender-specific

because the patterns are hard to predict and large corpora are usually required
to collect enough examples. This work shows a comparison of a neural model and
character language models with varying amounts on target language data. Our
usage scenario is interactive correction with nearly zero amounts of training
examples, improving models as more data is collected, for example within a chat
app. Such models are designed to be incrementally improved as feedback is given
from users. In this work, we design a knowledge-base and prediction model
embedded system for spelling correction in low-resource languages. Experimental
results on multiple languages show that the model could become effective with a
small amount of data. We perform experiments on both natural and synthetic
data, as well as on data from two endangered languages (Ainu and Griko). Last,
we built a prototype system that was used for a small case study on Hinglish,
which further demonstrated the suitability of our approach in real world

by Thomson scattering of photons by free electrons. Around recombination, the
Thomson scattering probability quickly diminishes as the free electrons combine
with protons to form neutral hydrogen off which CMB photons can scatter through
Rayleigh scattering. Unlike Thomson scattering, Rayleigh scattering is
frequency dependent resulting in the generation of anisotropies with a
different spectral dependence. Unfortunately the Rayleigh scattering efficiency
rapidly decreases with the expansion of the neutral universe, with the result
that only a small percentage of photons are scattered by neutral hydrogen.
Although the effect is very small, future CMB missions with higher sensitivity
and improved frequency coverage are poised to measure Rayleigh scattering
signal. The uncorrelated component of the Rayleigh anisotropies contains unique
information on the primordial perturbations that could potentially be leveraged
to expand our knowledge of the early universe. In this paper we explore whether
measurements of Rayleigh scattering anisotropies can be used to constrain
primordial non-Gaussianity (NG) and examine the hints of anomalies found by
WMAP and \textit{Planck} satellites. We show that the additional Rayleigh
information has the potential to improve primordial NG constraints by $30\%$,
or more. Primordial bispectra that are not of the local type benefit the most
from these additional scatterings, which we attribute to the different scale
dependence of the Rayleigh anisotropies. Unfortunately this different scaling
means that Rayleigh measurements can not be used to constrain anomalies or
features on large scales. On the other hand, anomalies that may persist to
smaller scales, such as the potential power asymmetry seen in WMAP and
\textit{Planck}, could be improved by the addition of Rayleigh measurements.

that the fluctuation relations known from stationary systems do no longer apply

physical interpretation of the corrected pumping fluctuation relations as well
as the role of many-body interactions remained unexplored. Here, we study
quantum systems with many-body interactions subject to slow time-dependent
driving, and show that fluctuation relations of the charge current can in
general not be formulated without taking into account the total energy current
put into the system through the pumping process. Moreover, we show that this
correction due to the input energy is nonzero only when Coulomb-interactions
are present. Thus, fluctuation response relations offer an until now unrevealed
opportunity to probe many-body correlations in quantum systems. We demonstrate

on a real-valued parameter that is partially identified through upper and lower
bounds with asymptotically normal estimators. A simple confidence interval is
proposed and is shown to have the following properties:
  - It is never empty or awkwardly short, including when the sample analog of
the identified set is empty.
  - It is valid for a well-defined pseudotrue parameter whether or not the
model is well-specified.
  - It involves no tuning parameters and minimal computation.
  Computing the interval requires concentrating out one scalar nuisance
parameter. In most cases, the practical result will be simple: To achieve 95%
coverage, report the union of a simple 90% (!) confidence interval for the
identified set and a standard 95% confidence interval for the pseudotrue
parameter.
  For uncorrelated estimators -- notably if bounds are estimated from distinct
subsamples -- and conventional coverage levels, validity of this simple
procedure can be shown analytically. The case obtains in the motivating
empirical application (de Quidt, Haushofer, and Roth, 2018), in which
improvement over existing inference methods is demonstrated. More generally,
simulations suggest that the novel confidence interval has excellent length and
size control. This is partly because, in anticipation of never being empty, the
interval can be made shorter than conventional ones in relevant regions of
sample space.

$d\ge 3$, at low-temperatures the Ising interface (dual-surface separating the
plus/minus phases) is rigid, i.e., it has $O(1)$ height fluctuations. Recently,
the authors decomposed these oscillations into pillars and identified their
typical shape, leading to a law of large numbers and tightness of their
maximum.
  Suppose we condition on a height-$h$ level curve of the interface, bounding a
set $S \subset \mathbb Z^{d-1}$, along with the entire interface outside the
cylinder $S\times \mathbb Z$: what does the interface in $S\times \mathbb Z$
look like? Many models of random surfaces (e.g., SOS and DGFF) fundamentally
satisfy the domain Markov property, whereby their heights on $S$ only depend on
the heights on $S^c$ through the heights on $\partial S$. The Ising interface
importantly does not satisfy this property; the law of the interface depends on
the full spin configuration outside $S\times \mathbb Z$.
  Here we establish an approximate domain Markov property inside the level
curves of the Ising interface. We first extend Dobrushin's result to this
setting, showing the interface in $S\times \mathbb Z$ is rigid about height
$h$, with exponential tails on its height oscillations. Then we show that the
typical tall pillars in $S\times \mathbb Z$ are uniformly absolutely continuous
with respect to tall pillars of the unconditional Ising interface. Using this
we identify the law of large numbers, tightness, and Gumbel tail bounds on the
maximum oscillations in $S\times \mathbb Z$ about height $h$, showing that
these only depend on the conditioning through the cardinality of $S$.

mechanics and computational physics in general. Classical constitutive models
for solid and fluid materials are typically local, algebraic equations or flow
rules describing the dependence of stress on the local strain and/or
strain-rate. Closure models such as those describing Reynolds stress in
turbulent flows and laminar--turbulent transition can involve transport PDEs
(partial differential equations). Such models play similar roles to
constitutive relation, but they are often more challenging to develop and
calibrate as they describe nonlocal mappings and often contain many submodels.
Inspired by the structure of the exact solutions to linear transport PDEs, we
propose a neural network representing a region-to-point mapping to describe
such nonlocal constitutive models. The range of nonlocal dependence and the
convolution structure are derived from the formal solution to transport
equations. The neural network-based nonlocal constitutive model is trained with
data. Numerical experiments demonstrate the predictive capability of the

without using data from that level, thanks to its interpretable mathematical

comprising a generative model for sampling from a target distribution and a
discriminative model for evaluating the proximity of a sample to the target
distribution. GANs exhibit strong performance in imaging or anomaly detection.
However, they suffer from training instabilities, and sampling efficiency may
be limited by the classical sampling procedure. We introduce variational
quantum-classical Wasserstein GANs to address these issues and embed this model
in a classical machine learning framework for anomaly detection. Classical
Wasserstein GANs improve training stability by using a cost function better
suited for gradient descent. Our model replaces the generator of Wasserstein
GANs with a hybrid quantum-classical neural net and leaves the classical
discriminative model unchanged. This way, high-dimensional classical data only
enters the classical model and need not be prepared in a quantum circuit. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on a credit card fraud dataset.
For this dataset our method shows performance on par with classical methods in
terms of the $F_1$ score. We analyze the influence of the circuit ansatz, layer
width and depth, neural net architecture parameter initialization strategy, and
sampling noise on convergence and performance.

perturbatively renormalizable and as a result perturbation theory is badly
divergent. Often the method of choice for investigating nonperturbative effects
has been the lattice formulation, and in the case of gravity the Regge-Wheeler
lattice path integral lends itself well for that purpose. Nevertheless, lattice
methods ultimately rely on extensive numerical calculations, leaving a desire
for alternate calculations that can be done analytically. In this work we
outline the Hartree-Fock approximation to quantum gravity, along lines which
are analogous to what is done for scalar fields and gauge theories. The
starting point is Dyson's equations, a closed set of integral equations which
relate various physical amplitudes involving graviton propagators, vertex
functions and proper self-energies. Such equations are in general difficult to
solve, and as a result not very useful in practice, but nevertheless provide a
basis for subsequent approximations. This is where the Hartree-Fock
approximation comes in, whereby lowest order diagrams get partially dressed by
the use of fully interacting Green's function and self-energies, which then
lead to a set of self-consistent integral equations. Specifically, for quantum
gravity one finds a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point in Newton's constant G
for spacetime dimensions greater than two, and nontrivial scaling dimensions
between d=2 and d=4, above which one obtains Gaussian exponents. In addition,
the Hartree-Fock approximation gives an explicit analytic expression for the
renormalization group running of Newton's constant, suggesting gravitational
antiscreening with Newton's G slowly increasing on cosmological scales.

nuclear equations of state and muon formation in the proto-neutron star (PNS),
which requires six-species transport with coupling of all neutrino flavors

quantum circuits to be deployed on quantum devices such as those available at
the IBM Q Experience. Quantum circuit reversibility is ensured by minimal
complements, extended recursively. Measurements are postponed to the end of

quantum effect. Quantamorphisms are classical catamorphisms which, extended to
ensure quantum reversibility, implement quantum cycles (vulg. for-loops) and
quantum folds on lists. By Kleisli correspondence, quantamorphisms can be
written as monadic functional programs with quantum parameters. This enables
the use of Haskell, a monadic functional programming language, to perform the

pushed through Quipper to the Qiskit interface to IBM Q quantum devices. The
generated quantum circuits - often quite large - exhibit the predicted
behaviour. However, running them on real quantum devices incurs into a

from singularities) by fluxes that satisfy the bound imposed by the tadpole
cancelation condition. More precisely, while the tadpole bound in the limit of
a large number of complex-structure moduli goes like 1/4 of the number of
moduli, we conjecture that the amount of charge induced by fluxes stabilizing
all moduli grows faster than this, and is therefore larger than the allowed
amount. Our conjecture is supported by two examples: K3 x K3 compactifications,
where by using evolutionary algorithms we find that moduli stabilization needs
fluxes whose induced charge is 44% of the number of moduli, and Type IIB
compactifications on CP^3, where the induced charge of the fluxes needed to
stabilize the D7-brane moduli is also 44% of the number of these moduli.
Proving our conjecture would rule out de Sitter vacua obtained via antibrane

physics may be degenerate with the predictions of two different models of dark
matter -- Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and a 7 keV sterile neutrino, which behaves as
Warm Dark Matter (WDM). Our models are calibrated to the observed UV luminosity
function at $z=4$ using two separate dust attenuation prescriptions, which
manifest as high and low star formation efficiency in low mass haloes. We find
that while at fixed star formation efficiency, $\varepsilon$, there are marked
differences in the abundance of faint galaxies in the two dark matter models at
high-$z$, these differences are mimicked easily by varying $\varepsilon$ in the
same dark matter model. We find that a high $\varepsilon$ WDM and a low
$\varepsilon$ CDM model -- which provide equally good fits to the $z=4$ UV
luminosity function -- exhibit nearly identical evolution in the cosmic stellar
mass and star formation rate densities. We show that differences in the star
formation rate at fixed stellar mass are larger for variations in $\varepsilon$
in a given dark matter model than they are between dark matter models; however,
the scatter in star formation rates is larger between the two models than they
are when varying $\varepsilon$. Our results suggest that JWST will likely be
more informative in constraining baryonic processes operating in high-$z$
galaxies than it will be in constraining the nature of dark matter.

open question in the wake of discoveries by LIGO/Virgo. In active galactic

stellar-mass black hole (BH) mergers in such environments can explain the
merger rate and the number of suspected hierarchical mergers observed by
LIGO/Virgo. The binary eccentricity distribution can provide further
information to distinguish between astrophysical models. Here we derive the
eccentricity distribution of BH mergers in AGN disks. We find that eccentricity
is mainly due to binary-single (BS) interactions, which lead to most BH mergers
in AGN disks having a significant eccentricity at $0.01\,\mathrm{Hz}$,
detectable by LISA. If BS interactions occur in isotropic-3D directions, then
$8$--$30\%$ of the mergers in AGN disks will have eccentricities at

LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, while $5$--$17\%$ of mergers have $e_{10\,\rm Hz}\geq 0.3$.
On the other hand, if BS interactions are confined to the AGN-disk plane due to
torques from the disk, with 1-20 intermediate binary states during each
interaction, or if BHs can migrate to $\lesssim10^{-3}\,\mathrm{pc}$ from the

strong episodic bursts of accretion activity, which appear to take place
preferentially as the amount of material accessible for star formation and

is, Helium is present in the ejecta, but produces no obvious features in the

code TARDIS to a SN Ic, and we investigate the question of how much Helium can

for the nearby, well-observed, and extensively modeled SN Ic 1994I, and we
perform a code comparison to a different, well-established Monte Carlo based
radiation transfer code. The code comparison shows that TARDIS produces
consistent synthetic spectra for identical ejecta models of SN1994I. In
addition, we perform a systematic experiment of adding outer He shells of
varying masses to our SN1994I models. We find that an outer He shell of only
$0.05M_{\odot}$ produces strong optical and NIR He spectral features for
SN1994I which are not present in observations, thus indicating that the SN1994I
ejecta is almost fully He deficient compared to the He masses of typical
He-rich SN progenitors. Finally we show that the He I $\lambda$20851 line
pseudo equivalent width of our modeled spectra for SN1994I could be used to
infer the outer He shell mass which suggests that NIR spectral follow-up of SNe

affected by the spatially-clustered stellar formation environment, either
through dynamical star-star interactions or external photoevaporation by nearby
massive stars. It is challenging to quantify how the architecture of planetary
systems is affected by these environmental processes, because stellar groups
spatially disperse within <1 billion years, well below the ages of most known
exoplanets. Here we identify old, co-moving stellar groups around exoplanet
host stars in the astrometric data from the Gaia satellite and demonstrate that
the architecture of planetary systems exhibits a strong dependence on local
stellar clustering in position-velocity phase space, implying a dependence on
their formation or evolution environment. After controlling for host stellar
age, mass, metallicity, and distance from the Sun, we obtain highly significant
differences (with $p$-values of $10^{-5}{-}10^{-2}$) in planetary (system)

Assuming that these stars have been enriched by the first generation of massive
metal-free stars, we consider the mass distribution of the enriching population
alongside the stellar mixing and explosion energy of their supernovae. For our
choice of stellar yields, our model suggests that the most metal-poor stars
were enriched, on average, by N*=5^{+13}_{-3} (1 sigma) Population III stars.
This is comparable to the number of enriching stars inferred for the most
metal-poor DLAs. Our analysis therefore suggests that some of the lowest mass
structures at z~3 contain the chemical products from <13 (2 sigma) Population
III enriched minihaloes. The inferred IMF is consistent with that of a Salpeter
distribution and there is a preference towards ejecta from minimally mixed
hypernovae. However, the estimated enrichment model is sensitive to small
changes in the stellar sample. An offset of ~0.1 dex in the [Mg/Ca] abundance
is shown to be sensitive to the inferred number of enriching stars. We suggest

averaged feedback prescriptions, where star particles are assumed to represent
single stellar populations that fully sample the IMF. This approximation breaks
down at high mass resolution, where stochastic variations in stellar
populations become important. We discuss various schemes to populate star
particles with stellar masses explicitly sampled from the IMF. We use Monte
Carlo numerical experiments to examine the ability of the schemes to reproduce
an input IMF in an unbiased manner while conserving mass. We present our
preferred scheme which can easily be added to pre-existing star formation
prescriptions. We then carry out a series of high resolution isolated
simulations of dwarf galaxies with supernovae, photoionization and
photoelectric heating to compare the differences between using IMF averaged
feedback and explicitly sampling the IMF. We find that if supernovae are the
only form of feedback, triggering individual supernovae from IMF averaged rates
gives identical results to IMF sampling. However, we find that photoionization
is more effective at regulating star formation when IMF averaged rates are
used, creating more, smaller H II regions than the rare, bright sources
produced by IMF sampling. We note that the increased efficiency of the IMF
averaged feedback versus IMF sampling is not necessarily a general trend and
may be reversed depending on feedback channel, resolution and other details.
However, IMF sampling is always the more physically motivated approach. We
conservatively suggest that it should be used for star particles less massive

surprising persistent oscillations of local observables. These oscillations
have been attributed to a special set of non-ergodic states, referred to as
quantum many-body scars. Although a significant amount of research has been
invested to understand these special states, it has remained unclear how stable
scar states are against disorder. We address this question by studying
numerically and analytically the magnetization and spatio-temporal correlators
of a model of interacting Rydberg atoms in the presence of disorder. While the
oscillation amplitudes of these observables decay with time as the disorder
strength is increased, their oscillation frequency remains remarkably constant.
We show that this stability stems from resonances in the disordered spectrum
that are approximately centered at the same scar energies of the clean system.
We also find that multiple additional sets of scar resonances become accessible
due to the presence of disorder and further enhance the oscillation amplitudes.
Our results show the robustness of non-ergodic dynamics in scar systems, and

the ratio of IR to UV luminosity (IRX) versus UV slope ($\beta$) as a function

with mass, age, and sSFR. We conclude that, of the physical properties tested
here, metallicity is the primary physical cause of the IRX-$\beta$ scatter, and
the IRX correlation with mass is presumably due to the mass dependence on
metallicity. Our results indicate that the UV attenuation curve steepens with
decreasing metallicity, and spans the full range of slope possibilities from a
shallow Calzetti-type curve for galaxies with the highest metallicity in our
sample (12+log(O/H)~8.6) to a steep SMC-like curve for those with
12+log(O/H)~8.3. Using a Calzetti (SMC) curve for the low (high) metallicity

for possible relations between the outflow properties and those of the host

three outflow properties $-$ outflow column density ($\mathrm{N_{out}}$),
maximum outflow velocity ($\mathrm{V_{max}}$), and normalized maximum velocity
($\mathrm{V_{norm}}$ = $\mathrm{V_{max}/V_{circ, halo}}$, where
$\mathrm{V_{circ,halo}}$ is the halo circular velocity). We observe clear

high-ion-traced outflows, with a stronger ($>~3\sigma$) $\mathrm{V_{max}}-$SFR
correlation. We find that the estimated mass outflow rate and momentum flux of
the high-ion outflows scale with SFR and can be supported by the momentum
imparted by star formation (supernovae and stellar winds). The kinematic
correlations of high-ion-traced outflows with SFR are similar to those observed
for star-forming galaxies at low redshifts.
  The correlations with SFR are weaker in low-ions. This, along with the lower
detection fraction in low-ions, indicates that the outflow is primarily
high-ion dominated. We also observe a strong ($>~3\sigma$) trend of normalized
velocity ($\mathrm{V_{norm}}$) decreasing with halo mass and increasing with
sSFR, suggesting that outflows from low-mass halos and high-sSFR galaxies are
most likely to escape and enrich the outer CGM and IGM with metals. By
comparing the CGM-GRB stacks with those of starbursts at $z\sim2$ and

expected in the leading edge of supernovae ejecta and sub-relativistic outflows

owing to the steep density profile. However, the prolonged shock evolution
exhibits two distinct pathways: In one, the shock strength diminishes with time
until the shock eventually dies out. In the other, the shock strength steadily
increases, and the solution approaches the self-similar solution of a shock is
a static medium. By mapping the parameter space of shock solutions, we find
that the evolutionary pathways are dictated by $\alpha$ and by the initial
ratio between the shock velocity and the local upstream velocity. We find that
for $\alpha<\omega_c$ ($\omega_c \approx 8$), the shock always decays, and that
for $\alpha>\omega_c$ the shock may decay or grow stronger depending on the
initial value of the velocity ratio. These two branches bifurcate from a
self-similar solution derived analytically for a constant velocity ratio. We

206893 B, a substellar companion orbiting within the debris disk of its F5V
star. The $J$, $H$, $K1$, and $K2$ spectra from GPI demonstrate the
extraordinarily red colors of the object, confirming it as the reddest
substellar object observed to date. The significant flux increase throughout
the infrared presents a challenging atmosphere to model with existing grids.
Best-fit values vary from 1200 K to 1800 K for effective temperature and from
3.0 to 5.0 for log($g$), depending on which individual wavelength band is fit
and which model suite is applied. The extreme redness of the companion can be
partially reconciled by invoking a high-altitude layer of sub-micron dust
particles, similar to dereddening approaches applied to the peculiar red field
L-dwarf population. However, reconciling the HD 206893 B spectra with even
those of the reddest low-gravity L-dwarf spectra still requires the
contribution of additional atmospheric dust, potentially due to the debris disk
environment in which the companion resides. Orbit fitting from four years of
astrometric monitoring is consistent with a $\sim$30-year period, orbital
inclination of 147$^{\circ}$, and semimajor axis of 10 au, well within the
estimated disk inner radius of $\sim$50 au. As one of very few substellar
companions imaged interior to a circumstellar disk, the properties of this

suggesting that there is no evolution over a long period of cosmic time, which
is consistent with previous studies. To derive the chemical abundances from the
measured equivalent widths (EWs), their dependence on nonabundance factors must
be corrected. In our previous paper, we proposed a method to derive the [Mg/Fe]

investigated the dependence of EWs on luminosity, which is known as the Baldwin

derived chemical abundances for the six luminous quasars at z ~ 2.7, and the
resultant abundances agree well with the prediction of chemical evolution

against adversarial attacks: randomly-smoothed functions have a universal
Lipschitz-like bound, allowing for robustness certificates to be easily
computed. In this work, we show that there also exists a universal
curvature-like bound for Gaussian random smoothing: given the exact value and
gradient of a smoothed function, we compute a lower bound on the distance of a
point to its closest adversarial example, called the Second-order Smoothing
(SoS) robustness certificate. In addition to proving the correctness of this
novel certificate, we show that SoS certificates are realizable and therefore
tight. Interestingly, we show that the maximum achievable benefits, in terms of
certified robustness, from using the additional information of the gradient
norm are relatively small: because our bounds are tight, this is a fundamental
negative result. The gain of SoS certificates further diminishes if we consider
the estimation error of the gradient norms, for which we have developed an
estimator. We therefore additionally develop a variant of Gaussian smoothing,
called Gaussian dipole smoothing, which provides similar bounds to randomized
smoothing with gradient information, but with much-improved sample efficiency.

identify non-ergodic states of matter beyond many-body localization (MBL).
Strongly disordered spin chains with non-Abelian symmetry and chains of
non-Abelian anyons are natural candidates, as they are incompatible with
standard MBL. In such chains, real space renormalization group methods predict
a partially localized, non-ergodic regime known as a quantum critical glass (a
critical variant of MBL). This regime features a tree-like hierarchy of
integrals of motion and symmetric eigenstates with entanglement entropy that
scales as a logarithmically enhanced area law. We argue that such tentative
non-ergodic states are perturbatively unstable using an analytic computation of
the scaling of off-diagonal matrix elements and accessible level spacing of
local perturbations. Our results indicate that strongly disordered chains with
non-Abelian symmetry display either spontaneous symmetry breaking or ergodic
thermal behavior at long times. We identify the relevant length and time scales

optically thin critical density ($\sim10^7\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$) is the highest
among the tracers ever used in CMZ surveys. Logistic regression is performed to
empirically formulate star formation probability of 195 HCN clumps, 13 of which
contain star formation signatures. The explanatory parameters in the best-fit
model are reduced into the virial parameter $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ without
significant contribution from other parameters, whereas the performance of the
model without $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ is no better than that using randomly
generated data. The threshold $\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ is 6, which translates
into a volume density ($n_{\mathrm{H_2}}$) of $10^{4.6}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ with
the $n_{\mathrm{H_2}}$-$\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ correlation. The scarcity of the
low-$\alpha_{\mathrm{vir}}$ clumps, whose fraction to all HCN clumps is 0.1,
can be considered as one of the immediate causes of the suppressed SFE. No
correlation between the clump size or mass and star formation probability is
found, implying that HCN $J$=4-3 does not immediately trace the mass of
star-forming gas above a threshold density. Meanwhile, star-forming and
non-star-forming clouds are degenerate in the physical parameters of the CS

$\lesssim2$ Myr, which is consistent with the tidal compression and X1/X2 orbit

However, there are conflicting reports -- summarized here for different glasses
-- on whether the structural relaxation time of glass can be calculated using
the Maxwell equation, which relates relaxation time with shear viscosity and
shear modulus. Hence, this study aimed to verify whether these two relaxation
times are comparable. The structural relaxation kinetics of a lead metasilicate
glass were studied by measuring the re-fractive index variation over time at
temperatures between 5 and 25 K below the fictive temperature, which was
initially set 5 K below the glass transition temperature. Equilibrium shear
viscosity was measured above and below the glass transition range, expanding
the current knowledge by one order of magnitude. The Kohlrausch equation
described very well the experimental structural relaxation kinetics throughout
the investigated temperature range and the Kohlrausch exponent increased with
temperature, in agreement with studies on other glasses. The experimental
average structural relaxation times were much longer than the values computed
from isostructural viscosity, as expected. Still, they were less than one order
of magnitude higher than the average relaxation time computed through the
Maxwell equation, which relies on equilibrium shear viscosity. Thus, these
results demon-strate that the structural relaxation process is not controlled
by isostructural viscosity, and that equilibrium shear viscosity only provides
a lower boundary for structural relaxation kinetics.

certainty individual stars within clusters of size $\approx 1\, \rm{pc}$. In
this work, we explore how such uncertainty in distance estimates can lead to
the misidentification of membership of sub-clusters selected by the minimum
spanning tree (MST) algorithm. Our goal is to assess how this impacts their
estimated properties. Using N-body simulations, we build Gravity-Driven
Fragmentation (GDF) models that reproduce self-consistently the early stellar
configurations of a star forming region. Stellar groups are then identified
both in 3- and 2-dimensions by the MST algorithm, representing respectively an
ideal and an inaccurate identification. We compare the properties derived of
these resulting groups, to assess the systematic bias introduced by projection
and incompleteness. We show that in such fragmented configurations, the
dynamical mass of groups identified in projection is systematically
underestimated compared to those of groups identified in 3D. This systematic
error is statistically of $50\%$ for more than half of the groups and reach
$100\%$ in a quarter of them. Adding incompleteness further increases this
bias. These results challenge our ability to identify accurately sub-clusters
in most nearby star forming regions where distance estimate uncertainties are
comparable to the size of the region. New clump finding methods have to tackle
this issue in order to define better the dynamical state of these

utilizes the popular gradient-based control law which, in this paper, is either
the distance-based or the bearing-only formation control. For the two and three

can give rise to an undesired invariant set where a distorted formation shape
is moving at a constant velocity. The (in)stability of such an invariant set is
dependent on the specified distance and bearing constraints. For the two robot

every $L^2$ harmonic form, or every $L^q$ harmonic form, $1<q(\ne 2)<3\, $

nonlinear partial differential inequalities for differential forms $

brain, is known to have many recurrent connections within its layers and from
higher to lower layers. But, in the case of machine learning with neural
networks, it is generally assumed that strict feed-forward architectures are
suitable for static input data, such as images, whereas recurrent networks are
required mainly for the processing of sequential input, such as language.
However, it is not clear whether also processing of static input data benefits
from recurrent connectivity. In this work, we introduce and test a novel
implementation of recurrent neural networks with lateral and feed-back
connections into deep learning. This departure from the strict feed-forward
structure prevents the use of the standard error backpropagation algorithm for
training the networks. Therefore we provide an algorithm which implements the
backpropagation algorithm on a implicit implementation of recurrent networks,
which is different from state-of-the-art implementations of recurrent neural
networks. Our method, in contrast to current recurrent neural networks,
eliminates the use of long chains of derivatives due to many iterative update
steps, which makes learning computationally less costly. It turns out that the
presence of recurrent intra-layer connections within a one-layer implicit
recurrent network enhances the performance of neural networks considerably: A
single-layer implicit recurrent network is able to solve the XOR problem, while
a feed-forward network with monotonically increasing activation function fails
at this task. Finally, we demonstrate that a two-layer implicit recurrent
architecture leads to a better performance in a regression task of physical
parameters from the measured trajectory of a damped pendulum.

and potentially vortices or horseshoes. The origin of the asymmetries and their
diversity remains unclear. We present a comprehensive study of 16 disks for
which the gas surface density profile has been constrained by CO isotopologue
data. We compare the azimuthal extents of the dust continuum profiles with the
local gas surface density in each disk, and find that the asymmetries
correspond to higher Stokes numbers or low gas surface density. We discuss
which asymmetric structures can be explained by a horseshoe, a vortex or spiral
density waves. Second, we reassess the gas gap radii from the $^{13}$CO maps,
which are about a factor 2 smaller than the dust ring radii, suggesting that
companions in these disks are in the brown dwarf mass regime ($\sim 15-50
M_{\rm Jup}$) or in the Super-Jovian mass regime ($\sim 3-15 M_{\rm Jup}$) on
eccentric orbits. This is consistent with the estimates from contrast curves on
companion mass limits. These curves rule out (sub)stellar companions ($q>$0.05)
for the majority of the sample at the gap location, but it remains possible at
even smaller radii. Third, we find that spiral arms in scattered light images
are primarily detected around high luminosity stars with disks with wide gaps,
which can be understood by the dependence of the spiral arm pitch angle on disk
temperature and companion mass.

cumulative regret averaged over the entire network. We propose a decentralized
Bayesian multi-armed bandit framework that extends single-agent Bayesian bandit
algorithms to the decentralized setting. Specifically, we study an information
assimilation algorithm that can be combined with existing Bayesian algorithms,
and using this, we propose a decentralized Thompson Sampling algorithm and
decentralized Bayes-UCB algorithm. We analyze the decentralized Thompson
Sampling algorithm under Bernoulli rewards and establish a problem-dependent
upper bound on the cumulative regret. We show that regret incurred scales
logarithmically over the time horizon with constants that match those of an
optimal centralized agent with access to all observations across the network.
Our analysis also characterizes the cumulative regret in terms of the network
structure. Through extensive numerical studies, we show that our extensions of
Thompson Sampling and Bayes-UCB incur lesser cumulative regret than the
state-of-art algorithms inspired by the Upper Confidence Bound algorithm. We
implement our proposed decentralized Thompson Sampling under gossip protocol,

shortly downstream of the shock impingement, without the need of any inflow
free-stream disturbances. The transition causes a localized significant
increase in the Stanton number and skin-friction coefficient, with high
incidence angles augmenting the peak thermomechanical loads in an approximately
linear way. Statistical analyses of the boundary layer downstream of the
interaction for each case are provided that quantify streamwise spatial
variations of the Reynolds analogy factors and indicate a breakdown of the
Morkovin's hypothesis near the wall, where velocity and temperature become
correlated. A modified strong Reynolds analogy with a fixed turbulent Prandtl
number is observed to perform best. Conventional transformations fail at
collapsing the mean velocity profiles on the incompressible log law. The WMLES
prompts transition and peak heating, delays separation, and advances
reattachment, thereby shortening the separation bubble. When the shock leads to
transition, WMLES provides predictions of DNS peak thermomechanical loads
within $\pm 10\%$ at a computational cost lower than DNS by two orders of

We randomly compromise some clients by manipulating different noise levels
reflected by the local privacy budget epsilon of differential privacy on the
local model updates of these Sybil clients such that the global model
convergence rates decrease or even leads to divergence. We apply our attacks to
two recent aggregation defense mechanisms, called Krum and Trimmed Mean. Our

effectively slow down the convergence of the global models. We then propose a
method to keep monitoring the average loss of all participants in each round

that our defense approach effectively mitigates the impact of our Sybil attacks

The structure of the system along with a value function parameterized in the
quadratic form provides a flexibility in analytically calculating an update

parameters is obtained, where the solution is used to characterize the optimal
feedback control in terms of the bases, at any time step. Moreover, the
quadratic form of the value function suggests a compact way of updating the
parameters that considerably decreases the computational complexity.
Considering the state-dependency of the differential equation, we exploit the

results, the presented algorithm is implemented on four nonlinear benchmark
examples, where the regulation problem is successfully solved while an

number of embeddings up to rigid motions for a given set of edge length

system. Naturally, the complex solutions of such systems extend the notion of
rigidity to $\mathbb{C}^d$. A major open problem has been to obtain tight upper
bounds on the number of embeddings in $\mathbb{C}^d$, for a given number $|V|$
of vertices, which obviously also bound their number in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
Moreover, in most known cases, the maximal numbers of embeddings in
$\mathbb{C}^d$ and $\mathbb{R}^d$ coincide. For decades, only the trivial bound
of $O(2^{d\cdot |V|})$ was known on the number of embeddings.Recently, matrix
permanent bounds have led to a small improvement for $d\geq 5$. This work
improves upon the existing upper bounds for the number of embeddings in

graphical construction, where the proof iteratively eliminates vertices or
vertex paths. For the most important cases of $d=2$ and $d=3$, the new bounds
are $O(3.7764^{|V|})$ and $O(6.8399^{|V|})$, respectively. In general, the
recent asymptotic bound mentioned above is improved by a factor of $1/

to understand what user attributes potentially cause users to share fake news.
The key to this causal-inference problem is to identify confounders --
variables that cause spurious associations between treatments (e.g., user
attributes) and outcome (e.g., user susceptibility). In fake news
dissemination, confounders can be characterized by fake news sharing behavior
that inherently relates to user attributes and online activities. Learning such
user behavior is typically subject to selection bias in users who are
susceptible to share news on social media. Drawing on causal inference
theories, we first propose a principled approach to alleviating selection bias
in fake news dissemination. We then consider the learned unbiased fake news
sharing behavior as the surrogate confounder that can fully capture the causal
links between user attributes and user susceptibility. We theoretically and
empirically characterize the effectiveness of the proposed approach and find
that it could be useful in protecting society from the perils of fake news.

release to brake pedal depression (AccPdl), and the cumulative time from light

Results indicate that the two brake lights containing incandescent bulbs led to

can present a hierarchy of competing treatments, from the least to most

Methods and Results: We introduce the notion of a treatment hierarchy question
that describes the criterion for choosing a specific treatment over one or more
competing alternatives. For example, stakeholders might ask which treatment is
most likely to improve mean survival by at least 2 years or which treatment is
associated with the longest mean survival. The answers to these two questions
are not necessarily the same. We discuss the most commonly used ranking metrics
(quantities that describe or compare the estimated treatment-specific effects),
how the metrics produce a treatment hierarchy and the type of treatment
hierarchy question that each metric can answer. We show that the ranking
metrics encompass the uncertainty in the estimation of the treatment effects in
different ways, which results in different treatment hierarchies. Conclusions:
Network meta-analyses that aim to rank treatments should state in the protocol
the treatment hierarchy question they aim to address and employ the appropriate
ranking metric to answer it.

of what is known about the stability of the various polymorphs of hybrid and
inorganic perovskites ABX$_{3}$ with large A cations and hence large tolerance
factor $t$. Remarkably, FAPI at room and higher temperature behaves like a
perovskite with large $t$, while just below room temperature it behaves like a
perovskite with small $t$. The kinetics of the transformations between the
polymorphs is enhanced by small amounts of intercalated water. It seems
therefore worthy to try improving the atomic diffusion and crystallization
during synthesis, and hence the final photovoltaic performance, through
controlled small amounts of water that should be thoroughly removed after a
sufficiently homogeneous and smooth microstructure is achieved.

is directed towards a voice-enabled smart-assistant device or not. An
undirected utterance is termed as a ""false trigger"" and false trigger
mitigation (FTM) is essential for designing a privacy-centric non-intrusive
smart assistant. The directedness of an utterance can be identified by running
automatic speech recognition (ASR) on it and determining the user intent by
analyzing the ASR transcript. But in case of a false trigger, transcribing the
audio using ASR itself is strongly undesirable. To alleviate this issue, we
propose an LSTM-based FTM architecture which determines the user intent from
acoustic features directly without explicitly generating ASR transcripts from
the audio. The proposed models are small footprint and can be run on-device
with limited computational resources. During training, the model parameters are
optimized using a knowledge transfer approach where a more accurate
self-attention graph neural network model serves as the teacher. Given the
whole audio snippets, our approach mitigates 87% of false triggers at 99% true
positive rate (TPR), and in a streaming audio scenario, the system listens to
only 1.69s of the false trigger audio before rejecting it while achieving the
same TPR.

formation models and population synthesis models, that planetesimals are
broadly distributed in the protoplanetary disc. Here we propose a new scenario
in which planetesimals can form in broad areas of the discs. Planetesimals form
at the gas pressure bump formed by a first-generation planet (e.g. formed by
pebble accretion) and the formation region spreads inward in the disc as the
planet migrates. We use a simple 1D Lagrangian particle model to calculate the
radial distribution of pebbles in the gas disc perturbed by a migrating
embedded planet. We consider that planetesimals form by streaming instability
at the points where the pebble-to-gas density ratio on the mid-plane becomes
larger than unity. We also study the effect of some key parameters like the
ones of the gas disc model, the pebble mass flux, the migration speed of the
planet, and the strength of turbulence. We find that planetesimals form in wide
areas of the discs provided the flux of pebbles is typical and the turbulence
is not too strong. The planetesimal surface density depends on the pebble mass
flux and the migration speed of the planet. The total mass of the planetesimals
and the orbital position of the formation area depend strongly on the pebble
mass flux. We also find that the profile of the planetesimal surface density
and its slope can be estimated by very simple equations. We show that our new
scenario can explain the formation of planetesimals in broad areas. The simple
estimates we provide for the planetesimal surface density profile can be used
as initial conditions for population synthesis models.

populations, the variance of each sample is approximately proportional to a

  In particular, it has been observed in the problems involving population

  For this many authors consider panel data in order to obtain laws of large

considering ergodic behaviors without independence. Thus we restrict the study
to stationary time series and we develop different Taylor exponents in this
setting.
  From a theoretic point of view, there has been a growing interest on the
study of the behavior of such a phenomenon. Most of these works focused on the
so-called static Taylor related to independent samples. In this paper, we
introduce a dynamic Taylor's law for dependent samples using self-normalised
expressions involving Bernstein blocks. A central limit theorem (CLT) is proved
under either weak dependence or strong mixing assumptions for the marginal
process. The limit behavior of such a new index involves the series of
covariances unlike the classic framework where the limit behavior involves the
marginal variance. We also provide an asymptotic result for for a

Taylor's law holds in empirical studies. Moreover, we also obtain a consistent

In contrast, using a model of opinion dynamics I have been developing for a few
decades within the framework of sociophysics, I predicted his victory against
all odds. According to the model, the winning paradoxical martingale of 2016,
has been Trump capability to activate frozen prejudices in many voters by
provoking their real indignation. However, four year later, Trump shocking
outings do not shock anymore, they became devitalized, losing their ability to
generate major emotional reactions. Does this mean that this time around he
will lose the 2020 election against Biden, as nearly all analysts, pundits and
commentators still predict? No, because with frozen prejudices remaining
frozen, the spontaneous prejudices will be activated but this time they will
benefit to both Biden and Trump. The main ones are the fear of the other
candidate policy and the personal stand facing a danger. In addition, Trump
presidency having polarized a large part of American voters into narrow-minded
anti-Trump and narrow-minded pro-Trump, those I denote in my model as
inflexibles, will be driving the dynamics of choices. Both effects, prejudices
and inflexibles can either compete or cooperate making their local combination
within each state, decisive to determine the faith of the state election. As a
result, tiny differences can make the outcome. Based on my rough estimates of
associated proportions of inflexibles and prejudices, the model predicts Trump
victory in the 2020 November election.

anchored to the solar surface destabilize and erupt away from the Sun. This
destabilization is often described in terms of an ideal magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) instability called the torus instability. It occurs when the external
magnetic field decreases sufficiently fast such that its decay index,
$n=-z\,\partial\,(\ln B)/\partial z$ is larger than a critical value, $n>n_{\rm
cr}$, where $n_{\rm cr}=1.5$ for a full, large aspect ratio torus. However,
when this is applied to solar MFRs, a range of conflicting values for $n_{\rm
cr}$ is found in the literature. To investigate this discrepancy, we have
conducted laboratory experiments on arched, line-tied flux ropes and have
applied a theoretical model of the torus instability. Our model describes an
MFR as a partial torus with footpoints anchored in a conducting surface and
numerically calculates various magnetic forces on it. This calculation yields a
better prediction of $n_{\rm cr}$ which takes into account the specific
parameters of the MFR. We describe a systematic methodology to properly
translate laboratory results to their solar counterparts, provided that the
MFRs have sufficiently small edge safety factor, or equivalently, large enough
twist. After this translation, our model predicts that $n_{\rm cr}$ in solar
conditions often falls near $n_{\rm cr}^{\rm Sol}\sim0.9$ and within a larger
range of $n_{\rm cr}^{\rm Sol}\sim(0.7,1.2)$ depending on the parameters. The
methodology of translating laboratory MFRs to their solar counterparts enables
quantitative investigations of the initiation of CMEs through laboratory
experiments. These experiments allow for new physics insights that are required
for better predictions of space weather events but are difficult to obtain
otherwise.

from the X-Calibur mission, which observed the accreting neutron star GX 301-2
from Antarctica, between December 29th 2018 and January 1st 2019. The
XL-Calibur design incorporates an X-ray mirror, which focusses X-rays onto a
polarimeter comprising a beryllium rod surrounded by Cadmium Zinc Telluride
(CZT) detectors. The polarimeter is housed in an anticoincidence shield to
mitigate background from particles present in the stratosphere. The mirror and
polarimeter-shield assembly are mounted at opposite ends of a 12 m long
lightweight truss, which is pointed with arcsecond precision by WASP - the
Wallops Arc Second Pointer. The XL-Calibur mission will achieve a substantially
improved sensitivity over X-Calibur by using a larger effective area X-ray
mirror, reducing background through thinner CZT detectors, and improved
anticoincidence shielding. When observing a 1 Crab source for $t_{\rm day}$
days, the Minimum Detectable Polarisation (at 99% confidence level) is
$\sim$2$\%\cdot t_{\rm day}^{-1/2}$. The energy resolution at 40 keV is
$\sim$5.9 keV. The aim of this paper is to describe the design and performance
of the XL-Calibur mission, as well as the foreseen science programme.

pixel-wise segmentation framework through a convolutional 3D to 2D MR patch
conversion model to predict class labels of the central pixel in the input
sliding patches. Precisely, we first extract 3D patches from each modality to
calibrate slices through the squeeze and excitation (SE) block. Then, the
output of the SE block is fed directly into subsequent bottleneck layers to
reduce the number of channels. Finally, the calibrated 2D slices are
concatenated to obtain multimodal features through a 2D convolutional neural
network (CNN) for prediction of the central pixel. In our architecture, both
local inter-slice and global intra-slice features are jointly exploited to
predict class label of the central voxel in a given patch through the 2D CNN
classifier. We implicitly apply all modalities through trainable parameters to
assign weights to the contributions of each sequence for segmentation.
Experimental results on the segmentation of brain tumors in multimodal MRI

This process requires a lengthy profiling stage, iterating over all the
available primitives for each layer configuration, to measure their execution
time on the target platform. Because each primitive exploits the hardware in
different ways, new profiling is needed to obtain the best performance when
moving to another platform. In this work, we propose to replace this

of performance modeling. Our approach speeds up the optimisation time
drastically. After training, our performance model can estimate the performance
of convolutional primitives in any layer configuration. The time to optimise
the execution of large neural networks via primitive selection is reduced from

We propose a hub-and-spoke design and utilize real data of student activities

same total number of buses to operate, each new bus route has 50\% or fewer
seats being used and takes maximumly 15 minutes, to reduce disease transmission

variations of peak demand, social-distancing requirements, and break-down
buses, to demonstrate the system resiliency of the new routes and schedules via
simulation. The new bus routes are implemented and used by all UM campuses
during the academic year 2020-2021, to ensure social distancing and short

a novel metric termed the ENsemble Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate (ENSURE)
framework, which can be used to train deep image reconstruction algorithms
without fully sampled and noise-free images. The proposed framework is the
generalization of the classical SURE and GSURE formulation to the setting where
the images are sampled by different measurement operators, chosen randomly from
a set. We evaluate the expectation of the GSURE loss functions over the
sampling patterns to obtain the ENSURE loss function. We show that this loss is
an unbiased estimate for the true mean-square error, which offers a better
alternative to GSURE, which only offers an unbiased estimate for the projected
error. Our experiments show that the networks trained with this loss function
can offer reconstructions comparable to the supervised setting. While we
demonstrate this framework in the context of MR image recovery, the ENSURE
framework is generally applicable to arbitrary inverse problems.

perihelion that is thought to directly supply the Geminid meteor stream. Both
of these objects currently have very small perihelion distances, which results
in them having perihelion temperatures of or exceeding 1000 K. The current
activity from Phaethon is relevant to the destruction of NEOs close to the Sun,
which most likely has produced meteor streams linked to asteroids in the past.
We model the past thermal characteristics of Phaethon and 2005 UD using a
combination of a thermophysical model (TPM) and orbital integrations of each
object. Temperature characteristics such as maximum daily temperature, maximum
thermal gradient, and temperature at varying depths are extracted from the
model, which is run for a predefined set of a and e. Next, dynamical
integrations of orbital clones of Phaethon and 2005 UD are used to estimate the
past orbital elements of each object. These dynamical results are then combined
with the temperature characteristics to model the past evolution of thermal
characteristics such as maximum (and minimum) surface temperature and thermal
gradient. We find that dwarf planet (2) Pallas is unlikely to be the parent
body for Phaethon and 2005 UD, and it is more likely that the source is in the
inner part of the asteroid belt. The orbital histories of Phaethon and 2005 UD
are characterized by cyclic changes in, resulting in perihelia values
periodically shifting between present-day values and 0.3 au. We find that the
subsurface temperatures are too large over this timescale for water ice to be

category. The fundamental property of the category $Pro(C)$ is that there is an
embedding $C \stackrel{c}{\rightarrow} Pro(C)$, $Pro(C)$ is closed under small
cofiltered limits, and these are free in the sense that for any category $E$
closed under small cofiltered limits, pre-composition with $c$ determines an
equivalence of categories $Cat(Pro(C),E)_+ \simeq Cat(C,E)$, (the $+$ indicates
the full subcategory of the functors that preserve cofiltered limits).
  In this work we develop a 2-dimensional pro-object theory. Given a 2-category
$\mathcal{C}$, we define the 2-category $2$-$\mathcal{P}ro(\mathcal{C})$ whose
objects we call 2-pro-objects. We prove that
$2\hbox{-}\mathcal{P}ro(\mathcal{C})$ has all the expected basic properties
adequately relativized to the 2-categorical setting, including the
corresponding universal property. We give an adecuate definition of closed
2-model 2-category and demonstrations of its basic properties. We leave for a
future work the construction of its homotopy 2-category. Finally, we prove that
our 2-category $2\hbox{-}\mathcal{P}ro(\mathcal{C})$ has a closed 2-model
2-category structure provided that $\mathcal{C}$ has one.
  Part of the motivation of this work was to develop a conceptual framework to
handle the $\check{C}$ech nerve in homotopy theory, in particular in strong
shape theory. The $\check{C}$ech nerve is indexed by the categories of covers
and of hypercovers, with cover refinements as morphisms, which are not filtered
categories, but determine 2-filtered 2-categories on which the $\check{C}$ech
nerve is also defined, sends 2-cells into homotopies, and determines a
2-pro-object of simplicial sets. Usually, the $\check{C}$ech nerve has to be
considered as a pro-object in the homotopy category, loosing the information
encoded in the explicit homotopies.

we target to explore the inter-subject variations eliminated facial expression
representation in the compressed video domain. In the up to two orders of
magnitude compressed domain, we can explicitly infer the expression from the
residual frames and possibly extract identity factors from the I frame with a
pre-trained face recognition network. By enforcing the marginal independence of
them, the expression feature is expected to be purer for the expression and be
robust to identity shifts. Specifically, we propose a novel collaborative
min-min game for mutual information (MI) minimization in latent space. We do
not need the identity label or multiple expression samples from the same person
for identity elimination. Moreover, when the apex frame is annotated in the
dataset, the complementary constraint can be further added to regularize the
feature-level game. In testing, only the compressed residual frames are
required to achieve expression prediction. Our solution can achieve comparable
or better performance than the recent decoded image-based methods on the
typical FER benchmarks with about 3 times faster inference.

defence mechanisms that enable apps to detect whether they are running in a

exploits the virtualization technique in a new way, achieving the full
feasibility against any Android app and proving the ineffectiveness of existing

installed as a standard Android app, but, after the installation, it launches
Mascara against the victim app. The malicious add-on is generated by Mascarer,

Concerning Mascara, we evaluated its effectiveness against three popular apps
(i.e., Telegram, Amazon Music and Alamo) and its capability to bypass existing

our attack by measuring the overhead introduced at runtime by the
virtualization technique and the compilation time required by Mascarer to

secret weights, where an aggregator wants to compute the weighted sum of the
local data of some agents. Depending on the privacy requirements posed on the
weights, there are different secure multi-party computation schemes exploiting
the information structure. First, when each agent has a local private value and
a local private weight, we review private sum aggregation schemes. Second, we
discuss how to extend the previous schemes for when the agents have a local
private value, but the aggregator holds the corresponding weights. Third, we
treat a more general case where the agents have their local private values, but
the weights are known neither by the agents nor by the aggregator; they are
generated by a system operator, who wants to keep them private. We give a
solution where aggregator obliviousness is achieved, even under collusion
between the participants, and we show how to obtain a more efficient
communication and computation strategy for multi-dimensional data, by batching
the data into fewer ciphertexts. Finally, we implement our schemes and discuss

the multi-exits pedestrian evacuation. To investigate the effect of guiding
strategies on evacuation efficiency, we propose a force-driven cellular
automaton model with adjustable guiding attractions imposed by the evacuation
assistants located in the exits. In this model, each of the evacuation
assistants tries to attract the pedestrians in the evacuation space towards its
own exit by sending a quantifiable guiding signal, which may be adjusted
according to the values of pedestrian density near the exit. The effects of
guiding strategies pursuing balanced pedestrian densities are studied. It is
observed that the unbalanced pedestrian distribution is mainly yielded by a
snowballing effect generated from the mutual attractions among the pedestrians,
and can be suppressed by controlling the pedestrian densities around the exits.
We also reveal an interesting fact that given a moderate target density value,
the density control for the partial regions (near the exits) could yield a
global effect for balancing the pedestrians in the rest of the regions and
hence improve the evacuation efficiency. Our findings may contribute to give
new insight into designing effective guiding strategies in the realistic
evacuation process.

Biased media can
influence people in undesirable directions and hence should be unmasked as

which rely only on the distribution of low-level lexical information fail to
detect media bias. This weakness becomes most noticeable for articles on new
events, where words appear in new contexts and hence their ""bias
predictiveness"" is unclear. In this paper, we therefore study how second-order
information about biased statements in an article helps to improve detection
effectiveness. In particular, we utilize the probability distributions of the
frequency, positions, and sequential order of lexical and informational
sentence-level bias in a Gaussian Mixture Model. On an existing media bias
dataset, we find that the frequency and positions of biased statements strongly
impact article-level bias, whereas their exact sequential order is secondary.
Using a standard model for sentence-level bias detection, we provide empirical
evidence that article-level bias detectors that use second-order information
clearly outperform those without.

adversarial perturbations to the inputs. To improve the robustness of these
models, one of the most popular defense mechanisms is to alternatively maximize
the loss over the constrained perturbations (or called adversaries) on the
inputs using projected gradient ascent and minimize over weights. In this
paper, we analyze the dynamics of the maximization step towards understanding
the experimentally observed effectiveness of this defense mechanism.
Specifically, we investigate the non-concave landscape of the adversaries for a
two-layer neural network with a quadratic loss. Our main result proves that
projected gradient ascent finds a local maximum of this non-concave problem in
a polynomial number of iterations with high probability. To our knowledge, this
is the first work that provides a convergence analysis of the first-order
adversaries. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that, in the initial phase of
adversarial training, the scale of the inputs matters in the sense that a
smaller input scale leads to faster convergence of adversarial training and a
""more regular"" landscape. Finally, we show that these theoretical findings are
in excellent agreement with a series of experiments.

In this work, we examine such computational issues for recently developed

which are statistically optimal in minimax sense, yet computationally
intensive. Such an estimator is computed as the minimiser of a smoothness
functional (e.g., TV norm) over the class of all estimators such that none of
its coefficients with respect to a given multiscale dictionary is statistically
significant. The so obtained multiscale Nemirowski-Dantzig estimator (MIND) can
incorporate any convex smoothness functional and combine it with a proper
dictionary including wavelets, curvelets and shearlets. The computation of MIND
in general requires to solve a high-dimensional constrained convex optimisation
problem with a specific structure of the constraints induced by the statistical
multiscale testing criterion. To solve this explicitly, we discuss three
different algorithmic approaches: the Chambolle-Pock, ADMM and semismooth
Newton algorithms. Algorithmic details and an explicit implementation is
presented and the solutions are then compared numerically in a simulation study
and on various test images. We thereby recommend the Chambolle-Pock algorithm
in most cases for its fast convergence. We stress that our analysis can also be
transferred to signal recovery and other denoising problems to recover more
general objects whenever it is possible to borrow statistical strength from

for non-equilibrium Feynman diagrams in the Keldysh-rotated form, which
simplifies the analysis considerably. Before the Keldysh rotation, each
worldsheet surface $\Sigma$ in the dual string theory expansion was found to
exhibit a triple decomposition into the parts $\Sigma^\pm$ corresponding to the
forward and backward segments of the closed time contour, and $\Sigma^\wedge$
which corresponds to the instant in time where the two segments meet. After the
Keldysh rotation, we find that the worldsheet surface $\Sigma$ of the dual
string theory undergoes a very different natural decomposition: $\Sigma$
consists of a ""classical"" part $\Sigma^{\textrm{cl}}$, and a ""quantum
embellishment"" part $\Sigma^{\textrm{qu}}$. We show that both parts of $\Sigma$
carry their own independent genus expansion. The non-equilibrium sum over
worldsheet topologies is naturally refined into a sum over the double
decomposition of each $\Sigma$ into its classical and quantum part. We apply
this picture to the classical limits of the quantum non-equilibrium system
(with or without interactions with a thermal bath), and find that in these
limits, the dual string perturbation theory expansion reduces to its
appropriately defined classical limit.

that travel rigidly in linear media without diffraction or dispersion at a

of spatio-temporal spectral correlations introduced into the field;
specifically, each spatial frequency is associated with a single temporal

temporal frequencies allows one to circumvent the proportionality between the
spatial and temporal bandwidths of ST wave packets, which has been one of their

We, therefore, measured the phonon spectra of 5d pyrochlore Cd2Os2O7 over the

(IXS). Our main finding is a visible mode-dependence in the phonon spectra,
measured across the metal-insulator transition at 227 K. We examined the SOC

with first-principle calculations. Our experimental data taken at 100 K are in
good agreement with the theoretical results obtained with the optimized U = 2.0

spectra both at initialization and over the course of training. Through this
analysis, we identify several statistical properties which appear linked to
Batch Norm's superior performance. We propose two simple normalizers,
PreLayerNorm and RegNorm, which better match these desirable properties without

applied in situations where Batch Norm is ineffective.

are thought to be more efficient and effective. Efficient global optimization
(EGO) is one of the most popular SAD methods for expensive black-box
optimization problems. A well-recognized weakness of the original EGO in
complex computer experiments is that it is serial, and hence the modern
parallel computing techniques cannot be utilized to speed up the running of
simulator experiments. For those multiple points EGO methods, the heavy
computation and points clustering are the obstacles. In this work, a novel
batch SAD method, named ""accelerated EGO"", is forwarded by using a refined
sampling/importance resampling (SIR) method to search the points with large
expected improvement (EI) values. The computation burden of the new method is
much lighter, and the points clustering is also avoided. The efficiency of the
proposed SAD is validated by nine classic test functions with dimension from 2
to 12. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithm indeed can
parallelize original EGO, and gain much improvement compared against the other
parallel EGO algorithm especially under high-dimensional case. Additionally, we
also apply the new method to the hyper-parameter tuning of Support Vector
Machine (SVM). Accelerated EGO obtains comparable cross validation accuracy
with other methods and the CPU time can be reduced a lot due to the parallel

in diverse applications. However, for disease diagnosis, the widely used
knowledge graph is hard to represent the symptom-symptom relations and
symptom-disease relations since the edges of traditional knowledge graph are
unweighted. Most research on disease diagnosis dialogue systems highly rely on
data-driven methods and statistical features, lacking profound comprehension of
symptom-disease relations and symptom-symptom relations. To tackle this issue,
this work presents a weighted heterogeneous graph based dialogue system for
disease diagnosis. Specifically, we build a weighted heterogeneous graph based
on symptom co-occurrence and a proposed symptom frequency-inverse disease
frequency. Then this work proposes a graph based deep Q-network (Graph-DQN) for
dialogue management. By combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with DQN to
learn the embeddings of diseases and symptoms from both the structural and
attribute information in the weighted heterogeneous graph, Graph-DQN could
capture the symptom-disease relations and symptom-symptom relations better.
Experimental results show that the proposed dialogue system rivals the
state-of-the-art models. More importantly, the proposed dialogue system can
complete the task with less dialogue turns and possess a better distinguishing
capability on diseases with similar symptoms.

driving based on unsupervised learning. Most of them take advantage of
reconstruction losses to remove dependency on disparity groundtruth. Occlusion
handling is a challenging problem in stereo matching, especially for
unsupervised methods. Previous unsupervised methods failed to take full
advantage of geometry properties in occlusion handling. In this paper, we
introduce an effective way to detect occlusion regions and propose a novel
unsupervised training strategy to deal with occlusion that only uses the
predicted left disparity map, by making use of its geometry features in an
iterative way. In the training process, we regard the predicted left disparity
map as pseudo groundtruth and infer occluded regions using geometry features.
The resulting occlusion mask is then used in either training, post-processing,
or both of them as guidance. Experiments show that our method could deal with
the occlusion problem effectively and significantly outperforms the other
unsupervised methods for stereo matching. Moreover, our occlusion-aware
strategies can be extended to the other stereo methods conveniently and improve
their performances.

frequently suffers from the formation of long-lived dark states, which include
excitons with intervalley charge carriers, spin-forbidden transitions, and a
large center-of-mass momentum located outside the light cone of dispersion
relations. Efficient relaxation from bright exciton states to dark states
suppresses the quantum yield of photon emission. In addition, the radiative
recombination of excitons is heavily influenced by Auger-type exciton-exciton
scattering, which yields another nonradiative relaxation channel at room
temperature. Here, we show that Auger-type scattering is promoted not only
between (bright) excitons but also between excitons and long-lived dark states.
We studied the luminescence dynamics of monolayer WS2 capped with hexagonal BN
over broad time ranges of picoseconds to milliseconds using carefully designed
pump-and-probe techniques. We observed that luminescence quenching associated
with Auger-type scattering occurs on 1-100 microsecond time scales, which thus
correspond to the lifetimes of the relevant dark states. The broad distribution

believed that magnetars could form by core-collapse (CC) explosions and compact
binary mergers, such as binary neutron star (BNS), binary white dwarfs (BWD),
and neutron star-white dwarf (NSWD) mergers. Therefore, it is important to
distinguish the various progenitors. The expansion of the merger ejecta
produces a time-evolving dispersion measure (DM) and rotation measure (RM) that
can probe the local environments of FRBs. In this paper, we derive the scaling
laws for the DM and RM from ejecta with different dynamical structures (the
mass and energy distribution) in the uniform ambient medium (merger scenario)
and wind environment (CC scenario). We find that the DM and RM will increase in
the early phase, while DM will continue to grow slowly but RM will decrease in
the later phase in the merger scenario. We fit the DM and RM evolution of FRB
121102 simultaneously for the first time in the BNS merger scenario, and find
the source age is $ \sim9-10 $ yr when it was first detected in 2012, and the
ambient medium density is $ \sim 2.5-3.1 $ cm$ ^{-3} $. The large offsets of
some FRBs are consistent with BNS/NSWD channel. The population synthesis method
is used to estimate the rate of compact binary mergers. The rate of BWD mergers
is close to the observed FRB rate. Therefore, the progenitors of FRBs may not
be unique.

remarkable success on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). However, it is not
clear if Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) can similarly benefit from such a
technique. In this paper, inspired by the similarity between CNNs and GCNs, we
study the impact of the Global Self-attention mechanism on GCNs. We find that
consistent with the intuition, the GSA mechanism allows GCNs to capture
feature-based vertex relations regardless of edge connections; As a result, the
GSA mechanism can introduce extra expressive power to the GCNs. Furthermore, we
analyze the impacts of the GSA mechanism on the issues of overfitting and
over-smoothing. We prove that the GSA mechanism can alleviate both the
overfitting and the over-smoothing issues based on some recent technical
developments. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets illustrate both
superior expressive power and less significant overfitting and over-smoothing
problems for the GSA-augmented GCNs, which corroborate the intuitions and the

However, a growing number of studies have shown that there exist adversarial
examples in DNNs, which are almost imperceptibly different from original
samples, but can greatly change the network output. Existing white-box attack
algorithms can generate powerful adversarial examples. Nevertheless, most of
the algorithms concentrate on how to iteratively make the best use of gradients
to improve adversarial performance. In contrast, in this paper, we focus on the
properties of the widely-used ReLU activation function, and discover that there
exist two phenomena (i.e., wrong blocking and over transmission) misleading the
calculation of gradients in ReLU during the backpropagation. Both issues
enlarge the difference between the predicted changes of the loss function from
gradient and corresponding actual changes, and mislead the gradients which
results in larger perturbations. Therefore, we propose a universal adversarial
example generation method, called ADV-ReLU, to enhance the performance of
gradient based white-box attack algorithms. During the backpropagation of the
network, our approach calculates the gradient of the loss function versus
network input, maps the values to scores, and selects a part of them to update
the misleading gradients. Comprehensive experimental results on \emph{ImageNet}
demonstrate that our ADV-ReLU can be easily integrated into many
state-of-the-art gradient-based white-box attack algorithms, as well as
transferred to black-box attack attackers, to further decrease perturbations in

emergence in the LB that is of opposite polarity to that of the sunspot. The

execute filter pruning accordingly. To increase the reliability of the results,
we prefer to have a more rigorous research design by including a scientific
control group as an essential part to minimize the effect of all factors except
the association between the filter and expected network output. Acting as a
control group, knockoff feature is generated to mimic the feature map produced
by the network filter, but they are conditionally independent of the example
label given the real feature map. We theoretically suggest that the knockoff
condition can be approximately preserved given the information propagation of
network layers. Besides the real feature map on an intermediate layer, the
corresponding knockoff feature is brought in as another auxiliary input signal
for the subsequent layers. Redundant filters can be discovered in the
adversarial process of different features. Through experiments, we demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art methods. For
example, our method can reduce 57.8% parameters and 60.2% FLOPs of ResNet-101

the time spent in each state. In a discrete-time HSMM, the duration in each

The recent occlusion handling strategy of popular two-stage approaches is to
build a two-branch architecture with the help of additional visible body
annotations. Nonetheless, these methods still have some weaknesses. Either the
two branches are trained independently with only score-level fusion, which
cannot guarantee the detectors to learn robust enough pedestrian features. Or
the attention mechanisms are exploited to only emphasize on the visible body
features. However, the visible body features of heavily occluded pedestrians
are concentrated on a relatively small area, which will easily cause missing
detections. To address the above issues, we propose in this paper a novel
Mutual-Supervised Feature Modulation (MSFM) network, to better handle occluded
pedestrian detection. The key MSFM module in our network calculates the
similarity loss of full body boxes and visible body boxes corresponding to the
same pedestrian so that the full-body detector could learn more complete and
robust pedestrian features with the assist of contextual features from the
occluding parts. To facilitate the MSFM module, we also propose a novel

annotations, respectively. To verify the effectiveness of our proposed method,
extensive experiments are conducted on two challenging pedestrian datasets:

radiative-transfer simulations, the community has developed sophisticated
models for these transients for a wide portion of the expected parameter space.
Using these simulations and surrogate models made from them, it has been
possible to perform Bayesian inference of the observed signals to infer
properties of the ejected matter. It has been pointed out that combining
inclination constraints derived from the kilonova with gravitational-wave
measurements increases the accuracy with which binary parameters can be
measured and allows a more accurate inference of the Hubble Constant. In order
to not introduce biases, constraints on the inclination angle for AT2017gfo
should be insensitive to the employed models. In this work, we compare
different assumptions about the ejecta and radiative reprocesses used by the
community and we investigate their impact on the parameter inference. While
most inferred parameters agree, we find disagreement between posteriors for the
inclination angle for different geometries that have been used in the
literature. According to our study, the inclusion of reprocessing of the
photons between different ejecta types improves the modeling fits to AT2017gfo
and in some cases affects the inferred constraints. Our study motivates the
inclusion of large $\sim$ 1 mag uncertainties in the kilonova models employed
for Bayesian analysis to capture yet unknown systematics, especially when
inferring inclination angles, although smaller uncertainties seem appropriate
to capture model systematics for other parameters. We also use this method to
impose soft constraints on the ejecta geometry of the kilonova AT2017gfo.

$*$-isomorphic, then $X$ and $Y$ are coarsely equivalent provided that either
$X$ or $Y$ contains no sparse subspaces consisting of ghostly measured
asymptotic expanders. Note that this geometric condition generalises the
existing technical assumptions used for rigidity of Roe algebras.
  Consequently, we show that the rigidity holds for all bounded geometry spaces
which coarsely embed into some $L^p$-space for $p\in [1,\infty)$. Moreover, we
also verify the rigidity for the box spaces constructed by Arzhantseva-Tessera
and Delabie-Khukhro even though they do \emph{not} coarsely embed into any
$L^p$-space.
  The key step towards our proof for the rigidity is to show that a
block-rank-one (ghost) projection on a sparse space $X$ belongs to the Roe
algebra $C^*(X)$ if and only if $X$ consists of (ghostly) measured asymptotic
expanders. As a by-product, we also deduce that ghostly measured asymptotic

heat engine to evaluate the capacity of outputting adequate power with high

thermoelectric heat engine can be achieved with the hypothetical boxcar-shaped
electron transmission, which is realized here by the resonant tunneling in the
one-dimensional symmetric InP/InSe superlattice. It is found with the transfer
matrix method that a symmetric mode is robust that regardless of the
periodicity, and the obtained boxcar-like electron transmission stems from the
strong coupling between symmetric mode and Fabry-P\'erot modes inside the
allowed band. High uniformity of the boxcar-like transmission and the sharp
drop of the transmission edge are both beneficial to the maximum power and the
EMP, which are optimized by the bias voltage and the thicknesses of barrier and
well. The maximum power and EMP are extracted with the help of machine learning

finite field called Finite State Systems (FSS), a dual linear system over the
space of functions on the state space is constructed using the dual map. This
system constitutes the well known Koopman linear system framework of dynamical
systems, hence called the Koopman linear system (KLS). It is first shown that
several structural properties of solutions of the FSS can be inferred from the
solutions of the KLS. The problems of computation of structural parameters of
solutions of non-linear FSS are computationally hard and hence become
infeasible as the number of variables increases. In contrast, it has been well
known that these problems can be solved by linear algebra for linear FSS in
terms of elementary divisors of matrices and their orders. In the next step,
the KLS is reduced to the smallest order (called RO-KLS) while still retaining
all the information of the parameters of structure of solutions of the FSS.
Hence when the order of the RO-KLS is sufficiently small, the above
computational problems of non-linear FSS are practically feasible. Next, it is
shown that the observability of the non-linear FSS with an output function is
equivalent to that of the RO-KLS with an appropriate linear output map. Hence,
the problem of non-linear observability is solved by an observer design for the
equivalent RO-KLS. Such a construction should have striking applications to
realistic FSS arising in Cryptology and Biological networks.

found a parallax measurement of 1.91+/-0.39 mas, equivalent to a mode distance
of d=560 pc (90% credible interval of 380-1050 pc). The progenitor was also
observed by the 2MASS and WISE surveys. When adopting the Gaia distance, the
spectral energy distribution of the progenitor is close to that of a G-type
star. Swift/XRT detected the supersoft X-ray emission of the nova (kT=30-40
keV) since day 236, and the inferred blackbody size is comparable to that of
other novae assuming d=560 pc (i.e., R_bb~5*10^8 cm). However, there is also an
unknown astrometric excess noise of 3.2 mas found in the Gaia data, and the
inferred distance becomes controversial. If the Gaia distance is accurate, the
gamma-ray luminosity of V549 Vel will be as low as L_gamma~4*10^33 erg/s,
making it the least luminous gamma-ray nova known so far. This may imply that
the shock properties responsible for the gamma-ray emission in V549 Vel are
different from those of the more luminous events. If the nova is located
farther away, it is likely a symbiotic system with a giant companion as the

This makes them unable to adapt at runtime in the face of three types of

user's latency-accuracy requirements change. In this paper we introduce
ApproxDet, an adaptive video object detection framework for mobile devices to
meet accuracy-latency requirements in the face of changing content and resource

scheduler to pick the best execution branch at runtime. We couple this kernel
with approximable video object tracking algorithms to create an end-to-end
video object detection system. We evaluate ApproxDet on a large benchmark video

ApproxDet is able to adapt to a wide variety of contention and content

EMD-like tool for instantaneous frequency (IF) estimation and component
separation of non-stationary multicomponent signals. Recently, a direct method
of the time-frequency approach, called signal separation operation (SSO), was
introduced to solving the problem of multicomponent signal separation. While
both SST and SSO are mathematically rigorous on IF estimation, SSO avoids the
second step of the two-step SST method in component recovery (mode retrieval).
In addition, SSO is simple: the IF of a component is estimated by a
time-frequency ridge of the SSO plane; and this component is recovered by
simply plugging the time-frequency ridge to the SSO operation. In recent paper
""Direct signal separation via extraction of local frequencies with adaptive
time-varying parameters"", after showing that the SSO operation is related to
the adaptive short-time Fourier transform (STFT), the authors obtained a more
accurate component recovery formula derived from the linear chirp (also called
linear frequency modulation signal) approximation at any local time and they
also proposed a recovery scheme to extract the signal components one by one
with the time-varying window updated for each component. However the
theoretical analysis of the recovery formula derived from linear chirp local
approximation has not been studied there. In this paper, we carry out such
analysis and obtain error bounds for IF estimation and component recovery.
These results provide a mathematical guarantee to the proposed adaptive

applied it to images with radiologist eye tracking points, which limits the
state-action space. Here we generalize the Deep-Q Learning to a gridworld-based
environment, so that only the images and image masks are required.
  Materials and Methods We trained a Deep Q network on 30 two-dimensional image
slices from the BraTS brain tumor database. Each image contained one lesion. We
then tested the trained Deep Q network on a separate set of 30 testing set
images. For comparison, we also trained and tested a keypoint detection
supervised deep learning network for the same set of training / testing images.
  Results Whereas the supervised approach quickly overfit the training data,
and predicably performed poorly on the testing set (11\% accuracy), the Deep-Q

optimization (TO) formulation that approximates the governing physics using
component-wise reduced order modeling, which can reduce solution time by
multiple orders of magnitude over a full-order finite element model while
providing a relative error in the solution of less than one percent. In
addition, the offline training data set from such component-wise models is
reusable, allowing its application to many design problems for only the cost of
a single offline training phase, and the component-wise method is nearly
embarrassingly parallel. We also show how the parameterization chosen in our
optimization allows a simplification of the component-wise reduced order model
(CWROM) not noted in previous literature, for further speedup of the
optimization process. The sensitivity of the compliance with respect to the
particular parameterization is derived solely in the component level. In
numerical examples, we demonstrate a 1000x speedup over a full-order FEM model

designs for two different cantilever beam examples, one smaller and one larger.
Finally, error bounds for displacement field, compliance, and compliance

a suitable training data set, and selecting a promising machine learning
technique. These steps often require a prolonged back-and-forth that makes this

so-called AutoML systems from being truly automatic. In this review article, we
introduce a new classification system for AutoML systems, using a seven-tiered

begin by describing what an end-to-end machine learning pipeline actually looks

so far. We highlight those subtasks which are still done manually - generally
by a data scientist - and explain how this limits domain experts' access to

characteristic acceleration scale of $g_\dagger \approx 1.2\times 10^{-10}$ m
s$^{-2}$. Whether this acceleration is a manifestation of a universal scale, or
merely an emergent property with an intrinsic scatter, has been debated in the
literature. Here we investigate whether a universal acceleration scale exists
in dispersion-supported galaxies using two uniform sets of integral field
spectroscopy (IFS) data from SDSS-IV MaNGA and ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$. We apply the
spherical Jeans equation to 15 MaNGA and 4 ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ slow-rotator E0
(i.e., nearly spherical) galaxies. Velocity dispersion profiles for these
galaxies are well determined with observational errors under control. Bayesian
inference indicates that all 19 galaxies are consistent with a universal
acceleration of $g_\dagger=1.5_{-0.6}^{+0.9}\times 10^{-10}$ m s$^{-2}$.
Moreover, all 387 data points from the radial bins of the velocity dispersion
profiles are consistent with a universal relation between the radial
acceleration traced by dynamics and that predicted by the observed distribution
of baryons. This universality remains if we include 12 additional non-E0
slow-rotator elliptical galaxies from ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$. Finally, the universal
acceleration from MaNGA and ATLAS$^{\rm 3D}$ is consistent with that for
rotationally supported galaxies, so our results support the view that dark
matter phenomenology in galaxies involves a universal acceleration scale.

from using single ID or interaction history to exploiting higher-order
neighbors. This leads to the success of graph convolution networks (GCNs) for
recommendation such as PinSage and LightGCN. Despite effectiveness, we argue
that they suffer from two limitations: (1) high-degree nodes exert larger
impact on the representation learning, deteriorating the recommendations of
low-degree (long-tail) items; and (2) representations are vulnerable to noisy
interactions, as the neighborhood aggregation scheme further enlarges the
impact of observed edges.
  In this work, we explore self-supervised learning on user-item graph, so as
to improve the accuracy and robustness of GCNs for recommendation. The idea is
to supplement the classical supervised task of recommendation with an auxiliary
self-supervised task, which reinforces node representation learning via
self-discrimination. Specifically, we generate multiple views of a node,
maximizing the agreement between different views of the same node compared to
that of other nodes. We devise three operators to generate the views -- node
dropout, edge dropout, and random walk -- that change the graph structure in
different manners. We term this new learning paradigm as
\textit{Self-supervised Graph Learning} (SGL), implementing it on the
state-of-the-art model LightGCN. Through theoretical analyses, we find that SGL
has the ability of automatically mining hard negatives. Empirical studies on
three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SGL, which improves
the recommendation accuracy, especially on long-tail items, and the robustness
against interaction noises. Our implementations are available at

core of various recommendation models including matrix factorization and neural
collaborative filtering. The standard approach creates an embedding table where
each row represents a dedicated embedding vector for every unique feature
value. However, this method fails to efficiently handle high-cardinality
features and unseen feature values (e.g. new video ID) that are prevalent in
real-world recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose an alternative
embedding framework Deep Hash Embedding (DHE), replacing embedding tables by a
deep embedding network to compute embeddings on the fly. DHE first encodes the
feature value to a unique identifier vector with multiple hashing functions and
transformations, and then applies a DNN to convert the identifier vector to an
embedding. The encoding module is deterministic, non-learnable, and free of
storage, while the embedding network is updated during the training time to
learn embedding generation. Empirical results show that DHE achieves comparable
AUC against the standard one-hot full embedding, with smaller model sizes. Our
work sheds light on the design of DNN-based alternative embedding schemes for
categorical features without using embedding table lookup.

  highly chromatic digraphs",,,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A $(2+1)$-bispindle $B(k_1,k_2;k_3)$ is the union of two $xy$-dipaths of
respective lengths $k_1$ and $k_2$, and one $yx$-dipath of length $k_3$, all
these dipaths being pairwise internally disjoint. Recently, Cohen et al.
conjectured that, for every positive integers $k_1, k_2, k_3$, there is an
integer $g(k_1, k_2, k_3)$ such that every strongly connected digraph not
containing subdivisions of $B(k_1, k_2; k_3)$ has a chromatic number at most
$g(k_1, k_2, k_3)$, and they proved it only for the case where $k_2=1$. For
Hamiltonian digraphs, we prove Cohen et al.'s conjecture, namely $g(k_1, k_2,
k_3)\leq 4k$, where $k=max\{k_1, k_2, k_3\}$. A two-blocks cycle $C(k_1,k_2)$
is the union of two internally disjoint $xy$-dipaths of length $k_1$ and $k_2$
respectively. Addario et al. asked if the chromatic number of strong digraphs
not containing subdivisions of a two-blocks cycle $C(k_1,k_2)$ can be bounded
from above by $O(k_1+k_2)$, which remains an open problem. Assuming that
$k=max\{k_1,k_2\}$, the best reached upper bound, found by Kim et al., is
$12k^2$. In this article, we conjecture that this bound can be slightly
improved to $4k^2$ and we confirm our conjecture for some particular cases.
Moreover, we provide a positive answer to Addario et al.'s question for the
class of digraphs having a Hamiltonian directed path.

using a new method of proof which relies on in a crucial way on a quantitative
bathtub principle. We believe our approach susceptible of being generalised to
other steady elliptic optimisation problems. In the second part of this paper,
we use this inequality to tackle a turnpike problem. Namely, considering a
bilinear control system of the form $u_t-\Delta u=\mathcal V u$, $\mathcal
V=\mathcal V(t,x)$ being the control, can we give qualitative information,
under $L^\infty$ and $L^1$ constraints on $\mathcal V$, on the solutions of the
optimisation problem $\sup \int_\Omega u(T,x)dx$? We prove that the
quantitative inequality for eigenvalues implies an integral turnpike property:
defining $\mathcal I^*$ as the set of optimal potentials for the eigenvalue
optimisation problem and $\mathcal V_T^*$ as a solution of the bilinear optimal
control problem, the quantity $\int_0^T \operatorname{dist}_{L^1}(\mathcal

When training deep net classifiers on those multi-modal datasets, the
modalities get exploited at different scales, i.e., some modalities can more
easily contribute to the classification results than others. This is suboptimal
because the classifier is inherently biased towards a subset of the modalities.
To alleviate this shortcoming, we propose a novel regularization term based on
the functional entropy. Intuitively, this term encourages to balance the
contribution of each modality to the classification result. However,
regularization with the functional entropy is challenging. To address this, we
develop a method based on the log-Sobolev inequality, which bounds the
functional entropy with the functional-Fisher-information. Intuitively, this
maximizes the amount of information that the modalities contribute. On the two
challenging multi-modal datasets VQA-CPv2 and SocialIQ, we obtain
state-of-the-art results while more uniformly exploiting the modalities. In

Our search identified 265 $^{13}$CO clouds with radii being $\sim$ 0.04 --
17.12 pc. We estimate the turbulent support and potential disruptive effect of
the outflow activities through analyzing physical properties of outflow
candidates and their host clouds in terms of turbulence and gravitational
binding energy. We find:(1) clouds of larger size might be less affected by
feedback; (2) the possible scale break is $\gtrsim 4.7$ pc for both turbulent
support and potential disruptive effect; (3) if outflows couple to dense gas
where stars are forming, for clouds in the Perseus arm, a scale $\lesssim$ 0.2
-- 0.4 pc is sufficient for the energy and momentum injected by outflow
activity to maintain turbulence, while for clouds in the Local arm, the scale
is $\lesssim$ 0.1 -- 0.2 pc; and (4) for clouds in the Perseus arm, a scale
$\lesssim$ 0.3 -- 1.0 pc is needed for outflow activity to potentially disperse
material away from the natal clouds, while for clouds in the Local arm, the
scale is $\lesssim$ 0.2 -- 0.6 pc.The strength of outflow activity may affect
the values in the points (3) and (4). Finally, we find that outflow feedback

magnetic quantum oscillations (MQOs) have been used to discern the topology of
orbits in Dirac materials. However, many previous researchers have relied on
the single-orbit Lifshiftz-Kosevich formula, which overlooks the significant
effect of degenerate orbits on MQOs. Since the single-orbit LK formula is valid
for massless Dirac semimetals with small cyclotron masses, it is imperative to
generalize the method applicable to a wide range of Dirac semimetals, whether
massless or massive. This report demonstrates how spin-degenerate orbits affect
the phases in MQOs of three-dimensional massive Dirac semimetal, NbSb$_2$. With
varying the direction of the magnetic field, an abrupt $\pi$ phase shift is
observed due to the interference between the spin-degenerate orbits. We
investigate the effect of cyclotron mass on the $\pi$ phase shift and verify
its close relation to the phase from the Zeeman coupling. We find that the
$\pi$ phase shift occurs when the cyclotron mass is 1/2 of the electron mass,
indicating the effective spin gyromagnetic ratio is $g_s$ = 2. Our approach is
not only useful for analysing MQOs of massless Dirac semimetals with a small
cyclotron mass, but also can be used for MQOs in massive Dirac materials with
degenerate orbits, especially in topological materials with a sufficiently
large cyclotron mass. Furthermore, this method provides a useful way to
estimate the precise $g_s$ value of the material.

that guarantees the secrecy of a successfully transferred classical message
even when all keys leak at a later time. We propose an Unclonable Encryption
protocol with the additional property that the sender's key material is allowed
to leak even in the case of an unsuccessful run. This extra feature makes it
possible to achieve secure quantum encryption even when one of the parties is
unable to protect its keys against after-protocol theft. Such an asymmetry
occurs e.g. in case of server-client scenarios, where the client device is
resource-constrained and/or located in a hostile environment.
  Our protocol makes use of a bidirectional quantum channel in a manner similar
to the two-way protocol LM05. Bob sends random qubit states to Alice. Alice
flips the states in a way that depends on the message and a shared key, and
sends the resulting states back to Bob. Bob recovers Alice's message by
measuring the flips. We prove that our protocol satisfies the definition of
unclonable encryption and additionally that the message remains secure even if
all of Alice's keys leak after the protocol. Furthermore, we show that some of
the key material can be safely re-used. Our security proof is formulated in
terms of diamond norms, which makes it composable, and allows for noisy quantum
channels. We work out the details only for the asymptotics in the limit of long
messages.
  As a side result we construct a two-way QKD scheme with a high key rate. We
show that its key rate is higher than the rate of the two-way QKD scheme LM05
proven for the case of independent channel noise.

understanding to what extent the inoculum impacts on the behaviour of the

methane production and microbial population dynamics. Three different inocula
were used: two from environmental sources (anaerobic sludge and river sediment)
and another one from a pre-enriched electroactive consortium adapted to
propionate degradation. Contrary to expectations, the reactor inoculated with
the pre-enriched consortium was not able to maintain its initial good
performance in the long run, and the bioelectrochemical activity collapsed
after three months of operation. In contrast, the reactor inoculated with
anaerobic sludge, although it required a relatively longer time to produce any
observable current, was able to maintain the electrogenic activity operation
(0.8 A.m-2) as well as the positive contribution of AD-MET integration to
tackle propionate accumulation and to enhance methane yield (338 mL.gCOD-1).
However, it must also be highlighted that from a purely energetic point of view
the AD-MET was not favorable.

composed of core and strahl populations as typically encountered in the
near-Sun solar wind as observed by Parker Solar Probe. We demonstrate that, as
a consequence of the evolution of the electron velocity distribution function,
two branches of the whistler heat flux instability can be excited, which can
drive whistler waves propagating in the direction oblique or parallel to the
background magnetic field. First, oblique whistler waves induce pitch-angle
scattering of strahl electrons, towards higher perpendicular velocities. This
leads to the broadening of the strahl pitch angle distribution and hence to the
formation of a halo-like population at the expense of the strahl. Later on, the
electron velocity distribution function experiences the effect of parallel
whistler waves, which contributes to the redistribution of the particles
scattered in the perpendicular direction into a more symmetric halo, in
agreement with observations. Simulation results show a remarkable agreement
with the linear theory of the oblique whistler heat flux instability. The
process is accompanied by a significant decrease of the heat flux carried by
the strahl population.

important cosmological quantities such as the equation of state $\omega_{_T}$,
energy density $\rho_{_T}$, density parameter $\Omega_{_T}$, and pressure
$p_{_T}$, which are the function of the redshift $z$. It is observed that in
both IR cut-offs the EoS parameter displays quintom-like behaviour for three

Universe is an accelerating model of rapid growth that is explained by quintom

investigated from a global point of view with an over 40 yr Mg II index. We
determined the time-varying rotational period lengths (RPLs) with the
synchrosqueezed wavelet transform which provides high temporal and frequency
resolution; furthermore, we compared the RPLs with the photospheric and coronal
RPLs obtained from the sunspot numbers and the 10.7 cm radio flux data. The
significance of the RPLs is taken into consideration. We found that the RPLs of
the chromosphere exhibit a downward trend, as do those that of the photosphere
and corona; in addition, their RPLs at the recent four solar maxima also show a
declining trend. It suggests that the rotation of the solar atmosphere has been
accelerating during the recent four solar cycles, which is inferred to be
caused by the declining strength of solar activity. The variations of the solar
atmospheric RPLs show periodicities of multiple harmonics of the solar cycle
period, and it is modulated by the solar activity cycle.

additional expressive power to enable diverging computation and to encode
recursive data-types (e.g., lists). Two formulations of recursive types exist:
iso-recursive and equi-recursive. The relative advantages of iso- and
equi-recursion are well-studied when it comes to their impact on
type-inference. However, the relative semantic expressiveness of the two
formulations remains unclear so far. This paper studies the semantic
expressiveness of STLC with iso- and equi-recursive types, proving that these
formulations are equally expressive. In fact, we prove that they are both as
expressive as STLC with only term-level recursion. We phrase these
equi-expressiveness results in terms of full abstraction of three canonical
compilers between these three languages (STLC with iso-, with equi-recursive
types and with term-level recursion). Our choice of languages allows us to
study expressiveness when interacting over both a simply-typed and a
recursively-typed interface. The three proofs all rely on a typed version of a
proof technique called approximate backtranslation. Together, our results show
that there is no difference in semantic expressiveness between STLCs with iso-

we believe our results scale to more powerful type systems like System F.

resort to Whittle's index approach for optimal AoI. In this paper, practical
Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) schemes which are widely-used in today's wireless networks

many terminals in this case, by explicitly deriving tight, closed-form AoI gaps
between optimum and achievable AoI by RR-P. In particular, it is rigorously
proved that for RR-P, under HARQ models concerning fading channels (resp.

within a constant of $(\sqrt{e}-1)^2/4\sqrt{e} \cong 6.4\%$ (resp. $6.2\%$ with

upwards and towards the symmetry axis of the central black hole. Eventually,
huge blobs appear, which supports the catastrophe model of episodic jets

core than the strain field, but the strain field dominates at long distances,
in agreement with recent numerical findings. The small restoring force of the
outside string motion places its average frequency close to the boson peak. The
average creation energy of a soft mode in this binary glass is about 2.5 times
the thermal energy at the freezing temperature. Scaling the soft potential
parameters of the numerical modes to metallic glasses, one finds quantitative
agreement with measurements of the sound absorption by tunneling states at low
temperatures and by the excess modes at the boson peak.

security researchers may leverage to motivate technical research into given
attack vectors and defenses. We subsequently apply this model to an original

the previous 60 years. Together, these are used to assess the state-of-the-art

lingering in other disciplines which the systems security community is aptly

scalars. Since the scalar mass is radiatively unstable, a special explanation
is required to make the mass much smaller than the UV scale. There are two
well-known mechanisms for the origin of scalar mass. The scalar can be
identified as a pseudo-Goldstone boson, whose shift symmetry is explicitly
broken by non-perturbative corrections, like the axion. Alternatively, it can
be identified as a composite particle like the glueball, whose mass is limited
by the confinement scale of the theory. In both cases, the scalar can be
naturally light, but interaction behavior is quite different. The lighter the
axion (glueball), the weaker (stronger) it interacts. We consider the dark
axion whose shift symmetry is anomalously broken by the hidden non-abelian
gauge symmetry. After the confinement of the gauge group, the dark axion and
the dark glueball get masses and both form multicomponent dark matter. We
carefully consider the effects of energy flow from the dark gluons to the dark
axions and derive the full equations of motion for the background and the
perturbed variables. The effect of the dark axion-dark gluon coupling on the
evolution of the entropy and the isocurvature perturbations is also clarified.
Finally, we discuss the gravo-thermal collapse of the glueball subcomponent
dark matter after the halos form, in order to explore the potential to
contribute to the formation of seeds for the supermassive black holes observed
at high redshifts. With the simplified assumptions, the glueball subcomponent
dark matter with the mass of $0.01-0.1 {\rm MeV}$, and the axion main dark
matter component with the decay constant $f_a={\cal O}(10^{15}-10^{16}){\rm

her agency on her own data. Maximum agency is afforded by local anonymization,
that allows each individual to anonymize her own data before handing them to
the data controller. Randomized response (RR) is a local anonymization approach
able to yield multi-dimensional full sets of anonymized microdata that are
valid for exploratory analysis and machine learning. This is so because an
unbiased estimate of the distribution of the true data of individuals can be

privacy guarantees. The main weakness of RR is the curse of dimensionality when
applied to several attributes: as the number of attributes grows, the accuracy
of the estimated true data distribution quickly degrades. We propose several
complementary approaches to mitigate the dimensionality problem. First, we
present two basic protocols, separate RR on each attribute and joint RR for all
attributes, and discuss their limitations. Then we introduce an algorithm to
form clusters of attributes so that attributes in different clusters can be
viewed as independent and joint RR can be performed within each cluster. After
that, we introduce an adjustment algorithm for the randomized data set that
repairs some of the accuracy loss due to assuming independence between
attributes when using RR separately on each attribute or due to assuming
independence between clusters in cluster-wise RR. We also present empirical
work to illustrate the proposed methods.

training \textit{meta-supersample} obtained by first sampling $2N$ independent

samples for each sampled task. The meta-training data fed to the meta-learner
is modelled as being obtained by randomly selecting $N$ tasks from the

formation sites of the clusters based on the Gaia~DR2 data is borrowed from the
literature. Those sources estimate the probability of belonging to the Galactic
bulge and disk, as well as to six known events of the merger of dwarf satellite
galaxies with the Milky Way, for 151~globular clusters. It is shown that all
metal-poor ($\rm{[Fe/H]}<-1.0$) genetically related globular clusters have high
relative abundances of $\alpha$-elements. According to modern views, since type
II supernovae release more $\alpha$-elements into the interstellar medium with
increasing mass, it has been suggested that masses of type II supernovae in the
Galaxy were greater than in the accreted galaxies. It is proved that the
clusters of the low-energy group, which were considered accreted, are
genetically related to a single protogalactic cloud, same as the unstratified
clusters UKS~1 and Liller~1, which most likely belong to the bulge. It is shown
that not only the lower but also the upper limits of the clusters' masses
decrease with an increase in the average radius of their orbits. The latter
fact is explained by a decrease in the masses of emerging clusters with a
decrease in the masses of their host galaxies. It is demonstrated that an
extremely multicomponent stellar population is observed only in accreted
globular clusters with an initial mass $>10^{6}M_{\odot}$. It has been
suggested that these clusters retained all the matter ejected by their evolved
stars, from which new generations of stars formed due to long evolution far
from our Galaxy.

leverages the syntactic relations and relative positions between each word and
the specified entity pair, is introduced to guide the attention to filter out

playing a pushing-away game between classifying a sentence into a true relation

restricted model of quantum computing able to calculate efficiently the
normalized trace of a unitary matrix. In this work we analyse the quantum
correlations named entanglement, Bell's nonlocality, quantum discord, and
coherence generated by the DQC1 circuit considering only two qubits (auxiliary
and control). For the standard DQC1 model only quantum discord and coherence
appear. By introducing a filter in the circuit we purify the auxiliary qubit
taking it out from the totally mixed state and consequently promoting other
quantum correlations between the qubits, such as entanglement and Bell's
nonlocality. Through the optimization of the purification process we conclude
that even a small purification is enough to generate entanglement and Bell's
nonlocality. We obtain, in average, that applying the purification process
repeatedly by twelve times the auxiliary qubit becomes 99% pure. In this
situation, almost maximally entangled states are achieved, which by its turn,
almost maximally violate the Bell's inequality. This result suggests that with
a simple modification the DQC1 model can be promoted to a universal model of

obscuration event. In 2016/17, Landt et al. conducted a near-IR spectroscopic
monitoring campaign on NGC 5548 and discovered He i 1.08 {\mu}m absorption.
Here we decompose this absorption into its components and study its time
variability. We attribute the narrow He i absorption lines to the warm absorber
and, as for the newly appeared low-ionization warm absorber lines in the UV,
their presence is most likely due to a reduction in ionization parameter caused
by the obscurer. The observed variability of the narrow He i absorption is
consistent with what is expected for the warm absorber. Most importantly, we
also detect fast, broad He i absorption, which we attribute to the obscurer.
This He i broad absorption, which is indicative of a high-column density gas,
is unsaturated and variable on time-scales of a few months. The observed
variability of the obscurer is mainly due to changes in ionization, although
density changes also play a role. We test the physical cycle model of
Dehghanian et al. which proposes that helium recombination can account for how
the obscurer influences the physics of the warm absorber gas. Our results
support their model, but also indicate that the reality might be more complex.

the reaction of C atoms with the mantels of molecular ices covering refractory

explicitly evaluates relative source and target contributions to a generation
decision. We argue that this relative contribution can be evaluated by adopting
a variant of Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Its underlying
'conservation principle' makes relevance propagation unique: differently from
other methods, it evaluates not an abstract quantity reflecting token
importance, but the proportion of each token's influence. We extend LRP to the
Transformer and conduct an analysis of NMT models which explicitly evaluates
the source and target relative contributions to the generation process. We
analyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of
prefixes, when varying the training objective or the amount of training data,
and during the training process. We find that models trained with more data
tend to rely on source information more and to have more sharp token
contributions; the training process is non-monotonic with several stages of
different nature.

phase in inducing such nonordinary behaviors, we study a system on a
two-dimensional square lattice consisted by interacting spin-1 Haldane chains,
which has a genuine SPT phase--the Haldane phase--at weak interchain
interactions and a quantum critical point belonging to the classical 3D O(3)
universality class to the N\'eel phase. Different from models studied
previously, there is no dimerization in the current model. Cutting the system
along the chain direction or perpendicular to the chain direction exposes two
different surfaces. Using unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we find
that the two different types of surface show completely different surface
critical behaviors at the bulk critical point, resulted from different surface
states in the SPT phase. For the system with surfaces along the chain
direction, the surface critical behavior is of ordinary type of the bulk 3D
O(3) critical point, while for the surfaces perpendicular to the chain
direction, the surface critical behavior is nonordinary, consistent with
special transitions found in dimerized Heisenberg models. Our numerical results

(HSC) deep survey, the Y band and i-Y color, to select the 4000A Balmer jump in
passive galaxies to the highest redshift possible within the survey. With the
rich multi-wavelength data in the HSC deep fields, we then confirm that the
selected galaxies are in the targeted redshift range of 1<z<1.5, lie in the
passive region of the UVJ diagram, and have high stellar masses at
log(M*/M_sun)>10.5, with a median of log(M*/M_sun)=11.0. A small fraction of
our galaxies is also covered by the HST CANDELS. Morphological analysis in the
observed H band shows that the majority of this subsample are early-type
galaxies. As massive early-type galaxies trace the high density regions in the
large scale structure in the universe, our study provides a quick and simple
way to obtain a statistical significant sample of massive galaxies in a
relative narrow redshift range. Our sample is 7-20 times larger at the massive
end (log(M*/M_sun)>10.5) than any existing samples obtained in previous
surveys. This is a pioneer study, and the technique introduced here can be
applied to future wide-field survey to study large scale structure, and to
identify high density region and clusters.

examine the electric field impact on the lithium coordination environment,
polymer structure as well as ionic transport properties and further present a

are able to exclude a structurally conditioned enhancement of ion transport and

spectroscopy, in particular (101429) 1998 $\mbox{VF}_{31}$, the only L5 Trojan
that does not belong to the Eureka family (Christou, 2013). We find that this
asteroid most likely belongs to the Bus-Demeo S-complex, in agreement with
Rivkin et al. (2007) and obtain good spectral matches with Sq- or S-type
asteroids, the lunar surface and of Martian and lunar meteorites. Mixture
fitting to spectral endmembers suggests a surface abundance of Mg-rich
orthopyroxene and iron metal or, alternatively, a mixture of plagioclase and
metal with a small amount of Mg-poor orthopyroxene. The metallic component may
be part of the intrinsic mineral makeup of the asteroid or an indication of
extreme space weathering.
  We discuss several origin scenarios for (101429). The asteroid could be
related to iron-rich primitive achondrites (Rivkin et al.), may have originated
as impact ejecta from Mars - as proposed recently for the Eureka family
asteroids (Polishook et al., 2017) - or could be a relic fragment of the Moon's
original solid crust. If, on the other hand, (101429) is a relatively recent
addition to the Martian Trojan clouds (Christou et al., 2020), its origin is
probably traced to high-inclination asteroid families in the Inner Main Belt.
  For the olivine-dominated Eureka family, we find that the two smaller
asteroids are more spectrally similar to one another than to (5261) Eureka.
Spectral profiles of all three asteroids are closely similar shortward of
$\sim$0.7$\mu$m but diverge at longer wavelengths. For the two smaller
asteroids in particular, we find the spectra are virtually identical up to
$0.8$$\mu$m. We attribute spectral differences in the near-IR region to
differences in either: degree of space weathering, olivine chemical composition
and/or regolith grain size.

step is to retrieve a query from the map database. This problem is called place
recognition. In recent years, LiDAR scan based place recognition has drawn
attention as it is robust against the appearance change. In this paper, we
propose a LiDAR-based place recognition method, named Differentiable Scan
Context with Orientation (DiSCO), which simultaneously finds the scan at a
similar place and estimates their relative orientation. The orientation can
further be used as the initial value for the down-stream local optimal metric
pose estimation, improving the pose estimation especially when a large
orientation between the current scan and retrieved scan exists. Our key idea is
to transform the feature into the frequency domain. We utilize the magnitude of
the spectrum as the place signature, which is theoretically rotation-invariant.
In addition, based on the differentiable phase correlation, we can efficiently
estimate the global optimal relative orientation using the spectrum. With such
structural constraints, the network can be learned in an end-to-end manner, and
the backbone is fully shared by the two tasks, achieving interpretability and
light weight. Finally, DiSCO is validated on three datasets with long-term
outdoor conditions, showing better performance than the compared methods.

influence in a social network has been a task of interest. Various methods have
been proposed to select the optimal vertices in a static network, however, they
are challenged by the dynamics, i.e. the time-dependent variation of the social
network structure. Such dynamics hinder the paradigm for static networks and
leaves a seemingly unbridgeable gap between algorithms of influence
maximization on static networks and those on dynamic ones. In this paper, we
extend our previous work and demonstrate that conjugate learning automata (an
elementary variant of reinforcement learning) that have been successfully
applied to maximize influence on static networks can be applied to dynamic
networks as well. The network dynamics is measured by the variation of the
influence range and absorbed into the learning procedure. Our proposal
delicately formulates the effect of network dynamics: the more the influence
range varies, the more likely the seeds are to be learned from scratch. Under
this assumption, the continuity of the network variation is fully taken
advantage of. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world networks
verify the privileges of our proposal against alternative methods.

convolutional networks with additional symmetry priors, which can lead to a
considerably improved performance. Recent advances in the theoretical
description of GCNNs revealed that such models can generally be understood as
performing convolutions with G-steerable kernels, that is, kernels that satisfy
an equivariance constraint themselves. While the G-steerability constraint has
been derived, it has to date only been solved for specific use cases - a
general characterization of G-steerable kernel spaces is still missing. This
work provides such a characterization for the practically relevant case of G
being any compact group. Our investigation is motivated by a striking analogy
between the constraints underlying steerable kernels on the one hand and
spherical tensor operators from quantum mechanics on the other hand. By
generalizing the famous Wigner-Eckart theorem for spherical tensor operators,
we prove that steerable kernel spaces are fully understood and parameterized in
terms of 1) generalized reduced matrix elements, 2) Clebsch-Gordan
coefficients, and 3) harmonic basis functions on homogeneous spaces.

were obtained as part of the follow-up that stemmed from the detection of
high-energy neutrinos and gamma rays with IceCube, \textit{Fermi}-LAT, MAGIC,

Auger Observatory is sensitive to neutrinos in the energy range from 100 PeV to
100 EeV and in the zenith angle range from $\theta=60^\circ$ to
$\theta=95^\circ$, where the zenith angle is measured from the vertical
direction. No neutrinos from the direction of TXS 0506+056 have been found. The
results were analyzed in three periods: One of 6 months around the detection of
IceCube-170922A, coinciding with a flare period of TXS 0506+056, a second one
of 110 days during which the IceCube collaboration found an excess of 13
neutrinos from a direction compatible with TXS 0506+056, and a third one from
2004 January 1 up to 2018 August 31, over which the Pierre Auger Observatory
has been taking data. The sensitivity of the Observatory is addressed for
different spectral indices by considering the fluxes that would induce a single
expected event during the observation period. For indices compatible with those
measured by the IceCube collaboration the expected number of neutrinos at the
Observatory is well-below one. Spectral indices as hard as 1.5 would have to
apply in this energy range to expect a single event to have been detected.

automata, are paradigmatic systems for the study of non-equilibrium phenomena.
Such systems evolve in discrete time-steps, and are thus free of
time-discretisation errors. Moreover, information about critical phenomena can
be obtained by simulating the evolution of an initial seed that, at any finite
time, has support only on a finite light-cone. This allows for essentially
numerically exact simulations, free of finite-size errors or boundary effects.
Here, we show how similar advantages can be gained in the quantum regime: The
many-body critical dynamics occurring in $(1+1)D$ quantum cellular automata
with an absorbing state can be studied directly on an infinite lattice when

simulating the dynamics of an associated one-dimensional, non-unitary quantum

they allow policy makers to test and compare various strategies to limit
disease transmission while mitigating collateral damage on the economy.
Epidemic models that are more faithful to the microscopic details of disease
transmission can offer more reliable projections, which in turn can lead to
more reliable control strategies. For example, many epidemic models describe
disease progression via a series of artificial 'stages' or 'compartments' (e.g.
exposed, activated, infectious, etc.) but an epidemic model that explicitly
tracks time since infection (TSI) can provide a more precise description. At
present, epidemic models with 'compartments' are more common than TSI models ,
largely due to higher computational cost and complexity typically associated
with TSI models. Here, however, we show that with the right discretization
scheme a TSI model is not much more difficult to solve than a comparment model
with three or four 'stages' for the infected class. We also provide a new
perspective for adding 'stages' to a TSI model in a way that decouples the
disease transmission dynamics from the residence time distributions at each
stage. These results are also generalized for age-structured TSI models in an
appendix. Finally, as proof-of-principle for the efficiency of the proposed
numerical methods, we provide calculations for optimal epidemic control by
non-pharmaceutical intervention. Many of the tools described in this report are
available through the software package 'pyross'

researchers to identify biomarkers from a system perspective by utilizing
network selection (consisting of functionally related biomarkers) as well as
network structures. In the main-effect analysis, network information has been

study is among the first to identify gene-gene interactions with the assistance
of network selection for phenotype prediction, while simultaneously
accommodating the underlying network structures. It innovatively respects the
multiple hierarchies among main effects, interactions, and networks. Bayesian
method is adopted, which has been shown to have multiple advantages over some

explore the posterior distribution. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate
the practical superiority of the proposed approach. The analysis of TCGA data

characteristic kinematic features on the MSs. We present a 2D kinematic

proper motions obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. Thanks to a careful
data reduction, well-measured bright stars in our proper-motion catalogs have
errors better than 0.5 mas yr$^{-1}$. We discuss the absolute motion of the MSs
in the field and their motion relative to Sgr A*, the Arches and the
Quintuplet. For the majority of the MSs, we rule out any distance further than
3-4 kpc from Sgr A* using only kinematic arguments. If their membership to the
GC is confirmed, most of the isolated MSs are likely not associated with either
the Arches or Quintuplet clusters or Sgr A*. Only a few MSs have proper motions
suggesting they are likely members of the Arches cluster, in agreement with
previous spectroscopic results. Line-of-sight radial velocities and distances

ceramics yields core-shell structures that give excellent functional
properties, but their precise phase assemblage and nanostructure remains an
open question. By comparing conventional electron energy loss spectroscopy
(EELS) with scanning precession electron diffraction (SPED) mapping using a
direct electron detector, we correlate chemical composition with the presence
or absence of octahedral tilting and with changes in lattice parameters. This
reveals that some grains have a 3-phase assemblage of a BaTiO3-rich pseudocubic
shell; a BiFeO3-rich outer core with octahedral tilting consistent with an R3c
structure; and an inner core richer in Ba and even poorer in Ti, which seems to
show a pseudocubic structure of slightly smaller lattice parameter than the
shell region. This last structure has not been previously identified in these
materials, but the composition and structure fit with previous studies. These
inner cores are likely to be non-polar and play no part in the ferroelectric
properties. Nevertheless, the combination of EELS and SPED clearly provides a
novel way to examine heterogeneous microstructures with high spatial
resolution, thus revealing the presence of phases that may be too subtle to
detect with more conventional techniques.

non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) have now reached 18%. However, this is still
lower than inorganic solar cells, for which PCEs >20% are commonplace. A key
reason is that OSCs still show low open-circuit voltages (Voc) relative to
their optical band gaps, attributed to non-radiative recombination. For OSCs to
compete with inorganics in efficiency, all non-radiative loss pathways must be
identified and where possible, removed. Here, we show that in most NFA OSCs,
the majority of charge recombination at open-circuit proceeds via formation of
non-emissive NFA triplet excitons (T1); in the benchmark PM6:Y6 blend, this
fraction reaches 90%, contributing 60 mV to the reduction of Voc. We develop a
new design to prevent recombination via this non-radiative channel through the
engineering of significant hybridisation between the NFA T1 and the
spin-triplet charge transfer exciton (3CTE). We model that the rate of the back
charge transfer from 3CTE to T1 can be reduced by an order of magnitude,
allowing re-dissociation of the 3CTE. We then demonstrate NFA systems where T1
formation is suppressed. This work therefore provides a clear design pathway
for improved OSC performance to 20% PCE and beyond.

directionality feature of mmWave channels, we first propose a novel initial
agglomerative nesting (AGNES) based user grouping algorithm by taking advantage
of the channel correlations. It is noted that the optimization of the SE/EE is
a challenging task due to the non-linear programming nature of the
corresponding problem involving user grouping, beam selection, and power
allocation. Our idea is to decompose the overall optimization problem into a
mixed integer problem comprising of user grouping and beam selection only,
followed by a continuous problem involving power allocation and digital
beamforming design. To avoid the prohibitively high complexity of the
brute-force search approach, we propose two suboptimal low-complexity user
grouping and beam selection schemes, the direct AGNES (DIR-AGNES) scheme and
the successive AGNES (SUC-AGNES) scheme. We also introduce the quadratic
transform (QT) to recast the non-convex power allocation optimization problem
into a convex one subject to a minimum required data rate of each user. The
continuous problem is solved by iteratively optimizing the power and the

external forcing (winds, radiation, heat and freshwater fluxes) and the
emergent turbulence, which transfers energy to dissipative structures. The
forcing gives rise to jets in the atmosphere and currents in the ocean, which
spontaneously develop turbulent eddies through the baroclinic instability. A
critical step in the development of a theory of climate is to properly include
the resulting eddy-induced turbulent transport of properties like heat,
moisture, and carbon. The baroclinic instability generates flow structures at
the Rossby deformation radius, a length scale of order 1000 km in the
atmosphere and 100 km in the ocean, smaller than the planetary scale and the
typical extent of ocean basins respectively. There is therefore a separation of
scales between the large-scale temperature gradient and the smaller eddies that
advect it randomly, inducing effective diffusion. Numerical solutions of the
two-layer quasi-geostrophic model, the standard model for studies of eddy
motions in the atmosphere and ocean, show that such scale separation remains in
the strongly nonlinear turbulent regime, provided there is sufficient bottom
drag. We compute the scaling-laws governing the eddy-driven transport
associated with baroclinic turbulence. First, we provide a theoretical
underpinning for empirical scaling-laws reported in previous studies, for
different formulations of the bottom drag law. Second, these scaling-laws are
shown to provide an important first step toward an accurate local closure to

edge sign captures the polarity of a relationship. Balance of signed networks
is a well-studied property in graph theory. In a balanced (sub)graph, the
vertices can be partitioned into two subsets with negative edges present only
across the partitions. Balanced portions of a graph have been shown to increase
coherence among its members and lead to better performance. While existing
works have focused primarily on finding the largest balanced subgraph inside a
graph, we study the network design problem of maximizing balance of a target
community (subgraph). In particular, given a budget $b$ and a community of
interest within the signed network, we aim to make the community as close to
being balanced as possible by deleting up to $b$ edges. Besides establishing
NP-hardness, we also show that the problem is non-monotone and non-submodular.
To overcome these computational challenges, we propose heuristics based on the
spectral relation of balance with the Laplacian spectrum of the network. Since
the spectral approach lacks approximation guarantees, we further design a
greedy algorithm, and its randomized version, with provable bounds on the
approximation quality. The bounds are derived by exploiting
pseudo-submodularity of the balance maximization function. Empirical evaluation
on eight real-world signed networks establishes that the proposed algorithms
are effective, efficient, and scalable to graphs with millions of edges.

in various contexts--from hiring to health care. The Rooney Rule is an
intervention developed to counter implicit bias and has been implemented in the
private and public sectors. The Rooney Rule requires that a selection panel
include at least one candidate from an underrepresented group in their
shortlist of candidates. Recently, Kleinberg and Raghavan proposed a model of
implicit bias and studied the effectiveness of the Rooney Rule when applied to
a single selection decision. However, selection decisions often occur
repeatedly over time. Further, it has been observed that, given consistent
counterstereotypical feedback, implicit biases against underrepresented
candidates can change.
  We consider a model of how a selection panel's implicit bias changes over
time given their hiring decisions either with or without the Rooney Rule in
place. Our main result is that, when the panel is constrained by the Rooney
Rule, their implicit bias roughly reduces at a rate that is the inverse of the
size of the shortlist--independent of the number of candidates, whereas without
the Rooney Rule, the rate is inversely proportional to the number of
candidates. Thus, when the number of candidates is much larger than the size of
the shortlist, the Rooney Rule enables a faster reduction in implicit bias,
providing an additional reason in favor of using it as a strategy to mitigate
implicit bias. Towards empirically evaluating the long-term effect of the
Rooney Rule in repeated selection decisions, we conduct an iterative candidate
selection experiment on Amazon MTurk. We observe that, indeed, decision-makers
subject to the Rooney Rule select more minority candidates in addition to those
required by the rule itself than they would if no rule is in effect, and do so
without considerably decreasing the utility of candidates selected.

efficient retriever that drastically reduces the search space for the expensive
reader. A rather overlooked question in the community is the relationship
between the retriever and the reader, and in particular, if the whole purpose
of the retriever is just a fast approximation for the reader. Our empirical
evidence indicates that the answer is no, and that the reader and the retriever
are complementary to each other even in terms of accuracy only. We make a
careful conjecture that the architectural constraint of the retriever, which
has been originally intended for enabling approximate search, seems to also
make the model more robust in large-scale search. We then propose to distill
the reader into the retriever so that the retriever absorbs the strength of the
reader while keeping its own benefit. Experimental results show that our method
can enhance the document recall rate as well as the end-to-end QA accuracy of
off-the-shelf retrievers in open-domain QA tasks.

medical imaging community. In continual environments, datasets acquired under
different conditions arrive sequentially; and each is only available for a
limited period of time. Given the inherent privacy risks associated with
medical data, this setup reflects the reality of deployment for deep learning
diagnostic radiology systems. Many techniques exist to learn continuously for
image classification, and several have been adapted to semantic segmentation.
Yet most struggle to accumulate knowledge in a meaningful manner. Instead, they
focus on preventing the problem of catastrophic forgetting, even when this
reduces model plasticity and thereon burdens the training process. This puts
into question whether the additional overhead of knowledge preservation is
worth it - particularly for medical image segmentation, where computation
requirements are already high - or if maintaining separate models would be a
better solution. We propose UNEG, a simple and widely applicable multi-model
benchmark that maintains separate segmentation and autoencoder networks for
each training stage. The autoencoder is built from the same architecture as the
segmentation network, which in our case is a full-resolution nnU-Net, to bypass
any additional design decisions. During inference, the reconstruction error is
used to select the most appropriate segmenter for each test image. Open this
concept, we develop a fair evaluation scheme for different continual learning
settings that moves beyond the prevention of catastrophic forgetting. Our
results across three regions of interest (prostate, hippocampus, and right

reinforcing the need for strong baselines in continual learning research.

In previous work on standardized mean difference and log-odds-ratio, we found
superior performance with an estimator of the overall effect whose weights use
only group-level sample sizes. The $Q$ statistic with those weights has the
form proposed by DerSimonian and Kacker. The distribution of this $Q$ and the
$Q$ with IV weights must generally be approximated. We investigate
approximations for those distributions, as a basis for testing and estimating
the between-study variance ($\tau^2$). Some approximations require the variance
and third moment of $Q$, which we derive. We describe the design and results of
a simulation study, with mean difference as the effect measure, which provides
a framework for assessing accuracy of the approximations, level and power of
the tests, and bias in estimating $\tau^2$. Use of $Q$ with sample-size-based
weights and its exact distribution (available for mean difference and evaluated
by Farebrother's algorithm) provides precise levels even for very small and
unbalanced sample sizes. The corresponding estimator of $\tau^2$ is almost
unbiased for 10 or more small studies. Under these circumstances this
performance compares favorably with the extremely liberal behavior of the
standard tests of heterogeneity and the largely biased estimators based on
inverse-variance weights.

minimum number of landmark nodes needed to distinguish every pair of nodes in
the graph based on graph distance. We study how much the MD can increase if we
add a single edge to the graph. The extra edge can either be selected
adversarially, in which case we are interested in the largest possible value
that the MD can take, or uniformly at random, in which case we are interested
in the distribution of the MD. The adversarial setting has already been studied
by [Eroh et. al., 2015] for general graphs, who found an example where the MD
doubles on adding a single edge. By constructing a different example, we show
that this increase can be as large as exponential. However, we believe that
such a large increase can occur only in specially constructed graphs, and that
in most interesting graph families, the MD at most doubles on adding a single
edge. We prove this for $d$-dimensional grid graphs, by showing that $2d$
appropriately chosen corners and the endpoints of the extra edge can
distinguish every pair of nodes, no matter where the edge is added. For the
special case of $d=2$, we show that it suffices to choose the four corners as
landmarks. Finally, when the extra edge is sampled uniformly at random, we
conjecture that the MD of 2-dimensional grids converges in probability to
$3+\mathrm{Ber}(8/27)$, and we give an almost complete proof.

measurement information both prior and posterior to the estimation time. Two
notable examples of this technique are the Rauch-Tung-Striebel and
Mayne-Fraser-Potter smoothing techniques for linear Gaussian systems, both
resulting in the optimal smoothed estimate of the state. However, when
considering a quantum system, classical smoothing techniques can result in an
estimate that is not a valid quantum state. Consequently, a different smoothing
theory was developed explicitly for quantum systems. This theory has since been
applied to the special case of linear Gaussian quantum (LGQ) systems, where, in
deriving the LGQ state smoothing equations, the Mayne-Fraser-Potter technique
was utilised. As a result, the final equations describing the smoothed state
are closely related to the classical Mayne-Fraser-Potter smoothing equations.
In this paper, I derive the equivalent Rauch-Tung-Striebel form of the quantum
state smoothing equations, which further simplify the calculation for the
smoothed quantum state in LGQ systems. Additionally, the new form of the LGQ
smoothing equations bring to light a property of the smoothed quantum state
that was hidden in the Mayne-Fraser-Potter form, the non-differentiablilty of
the smoothed mean. By identifying the non-differentiable part of the smoothed
mean, I was then able to derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the
quantum smoothed mean to be differentiable in the steady state regime.

galactic disk are significantly stripped in the presence of the moderate winds,
whereas turbulent pressure provides support against ram pressure in the central
region where star formation is active. Moderate ICM winds facilitate gas
collapsing, increasing the total star formation rates by ~40% when the wind is
oriented face-on or ~80% when it is edge-on. In contrast, strong winds rapidly
blow away neutral and molecular hydrogen gas from the galaxy, suppressing the
star formation by a factor of two within ~200 Myr. Dense gas clumps with N_H >

young stellar populations are found in such clumps. In our attempts to enhance

field points vertically downwards, has long been a topic of scientific
fascination. Since the first in-situ measurements in 1831 of its location in
the Canadian arctic, the pole has drifted inexorably towards Siberia,
accelerating between 1990 and 2005 from its historic speed of 0-15 km/yr to its
present speed of 50-60 km/yr. In late October 2017 the north magnetic pole
crossed the international date line, passing within 390 km of the geographic
pole, and is now moving southwards. Here we show that over the last two decades
the position of the north magnetic pole has been largely determined by two
large-scale lobes of negative magnetic flux on the core-mantle-boundary under
Canada and Siberia. Localised modelling shows that elongation of the Canadian
lobe, likely caused by an alteration in the pattern of core-flow between 1970
and 1999, significantly weakened its signature on Earth's surface causing the
pole to accelerate towards Siberia. A range of simple models that capture this
process indicate that over the next decade the north magnetic pole will
continue on its current trajectory travelling a further 390-660 km towards
Siberia.

$\ln(2n/\varepsilon)$, where $\varepsilon>0$ is a probability of failure. The
sampling points should be picked at random according to a well-chosen
probability measure $\sigma$ whose density is given by the inverse Christoffel
function that depends both on $V_n$ and $\mu$. While this approach is greatly
facilitated when $D$ and $\mu$ have tensor product structure, it becomes
problematic for domains $D$ with arbitrary geometry since the optimal measure
depends on an orthonormal basis of $V_n$ in $L^2(D,\mu)$ which is not
explicitly given, even for simple polynomial spaces. Therefore sampling
according to this measure is not practically feasible. In this paper, we
discuss practical sampling strategies, which amount to using a perturbed

improve the learning effectiveness and efficiency when training deep neural
networks, among which some recent influential attempts would like to adaptively
control the parameter-wise learning rate (e.g., Adam and RMSProp). Although
they show a large improvement in convergence speed, most adaptive learning rate
methods suffer from compromised generalization compared with SGD. In this
paper, we proposed an Adaptive Gradient Method with Resilience and Momentum
(AdaRem), motivated by the observation that the oscillations of network
parameters slow the training, and give a theoretical proof of convergence. For
each parameter, AdaRem adjusts the parameter-wise learning rate according to
whether the direction of one parameter changes in the past is aligned with the
direction of the current gradient, and thus encourages long-term consistent
parameter updating with much fewer oscillations. Comprehensive experiments have
been conducted to verify the effectiveness of AdaRem when training various
models on a large-scale image recognition dataset, e.g., ImageNet, which also
demonstrate that our method outperforms previous adaptive learning rate-based
algorithms in terms of the training speed and the test error, respectively.

studied here combines evolving surface finite elements, whose nodes determine

time integration. The numerical method is based on a system coupling the
surface evolution to non-linear second-order parabolic evolution equations for
the normal velocity and normal vector. Convergence proofs are presented in the
case of finite elements of polynomial degree at least two and backward
difference formulae of orders two to five. The error analysis combines
stability estimates and consistency estimates to yield optimal-order $H^1$-norm
error bounds for the computed surface position, velocity, normal vector, normal
velocity, and therefore for the mean curvature. The stability analysis is
performed in the matrix-vector formulation, and is independent of geometric
arguments, which only enter the consistency analysis. Numerical experiments are

periodic-antiperiodic boundary conditions, i.e. a graph $\Gamma$ in the Klein
bottle $K$. Let $\Gamma_{mn}$ denote the graph obtained by pasting $m$ rows and
$n$ columns of copies of $\Gamma$, which embeds in $K$ for $n$ odd and in the
torus $\mathbb{T}^2$ for $n$ even. We compute the dimer partition function
$Z_{mn}$ of $\Gamma_{mn}$ for $n$ odd, in terms of the well-known
characteristic polynomial $P$ of $\Gamma_{12}\subset\mathbb{T}^2$ together with
a new characteristic polynomial $R$ of $\Gamma\subset K$. Using this result
together with work of Kenyon, Sun and Wilson [arXiv:1310.2603], we show that in
the bipartite case, this partition function has the asymptotic expansion $\log
Z_{mn}=mn f_0/2 +\mathrm{fsc}+o(1)$, for $m, n$ tending to infinity and $m/n$
bounded below and above, where $f_0$ is the bulk free energy for
$\Gamma_{12}\subset\mathbb{T}^2$ and $\mathrm{fsc}$ an explicit finite-size
correction term. The remarkable feature of this later term is its universality:
it does not depend on the graph $\Gamma$, but only on the zeros of $P$ on the
unit torus and on an explicit (purely imaginary) shape parameter. A similar
expansion is also obtained in the non-bipartite case, assuming a conjectural
condition on the zeros of $P$. We then show that this asymptotic expansion
holds for the Ising partition function as well, with $\mathrm{fsc}$ taking a
particularly simple form: it vanishes in the subcritical regime, is equal to
$\log(2)$ in the supercritical regime, and to an explicit function of the shape
parameter at criticality. These results are in full agreement with the
conformal field theory predictions of Bl\""ote, Cardy and Nightingale.

techniques, including double-sensor conductivity probes, high-speed imaging,

of interest (QoIs), including void fraction and phasic velocities, are obtained
to support the modular Bayesian inference. In the process, the epistemic
uncertainties of the closure relations are inversely quantified, the aleatory
uncertainties from stochastic fluctuation of the system are evaluated based on
experimental uncertainty analysis. The combined uncertainties are then
propagated through the MCFD solver to obtain uncertainties of QoIs, based on
which probability-boxes are constructed for validation. The proposed approach
relies on three machine learning methods: feedforward neural networks and
principal component analysis for surrogate modeling, and Gaussian processes for
model form uncertainty modeling. The whole process is implemented within the
framework of open-source deep learning library PyTorch with graphics processing

determined kinematic distances from the velocity components, in order to
analyze the structure of the outer Galaxy and to estimate physical properties
such as dust temperatures, bolometric luminosities, clump masses, and H2 column
densities for 611 clumps. We find the CO clouds to be strongly correlated with
the highest column density parts of the Hi emission distribution, spanning a
web of bridges, spurs and blobs of star forming regions between the larger
complexes, unveiling the complex three-dimensional structure of the outer
Galaxy in unprecedented detail. Using the physical properties of the clumps, we
find an upper limit of 6% (40 sources) to be able to form high-mass stars. This
is supported by the fact that only 2 methanol Class II masers or 34 known or
candidate Hii regions are found in the whole survey area, indicating an even
lower fraction to be able to form high-mass stars in the outer Galaxy. We fail
to find any correlation of the physical parameters of the identified

In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and critical analysis of the data
leakage issue in recommender system offline evaluation. Data leakage is caused
by not observing global timeline in evaluating recommenders, e.g., train/test
data split does not follow global timeline. As a result, a model learns from
the user-item interactions that are not expected to be available at prediction
time. We first show the temporal dynamics of user-item interactions along
global timeline, then explain why data leakage exists for collaborative
filtering models. Through carefully designed experiments, we show that all
models indeed recommend future items that are not available at the time point
of a test instance, as the result of data leakage. The experiments are
conducted with four widely used baseline models - BPR, NeuMF, SASRec, and
LightGCN, on four popular offline datasets - MovieLens-25M, Yelp, Amazon-music,
and Amazon-electronic, adopting leave-last-one-out data split. We further show
that data leakage does impact models' recommendation accuracy. Their relative
performance orders thus become unpredictable with different amount of leaked
future data in training. To evaluate recommendation systems in a realistic

planner for UAVs that generates collision-free trajectories in environments
with static obstacles, dynamic obstacles, and other planning agents. Real-time
collision avoidance with other dynamic obstacles or agents is done by
performing outer polyhedral representations of every interval of the
trajectories and then including the plane that separates each pair of polyhedra
as a decision variable in the optimization problem. MADER uses our recently
developed MINVO basis to obtain outer polyhedral representations with volumes
2.36 and 254.9 times, respectively, smaller than the Bernstein or B-Spline
bases used extensively in the planning literature. Our decentralized and
asynchronous algorithm guarantees safety with respect to other agents by
including their committed trajectories as constraints in the optimization and
then executing a collision check-recheck scheme. Finally, extensive simulations
in challenging cluttered environments show up to a 33.9% reduction in the
flight time, and a 88.8% reduction in the number of stops compared to the
Bernstein and B-Spline bases, shorter flight distances than centralized
approaches, and shorter total times on average than synchronous decentralized

Most of the research and development efforts have been concentrated on
improving the performance of the fraud scoring models. Yet, the downstream
fraud alert systems still have limited to no model adoption and rely on manual
steps. Alert systems are pervasively used across all payment channels in retail
banking and play an important role in the overall fraud detection process.
Current fraud detection systems end up with large numbers of dropped alerts due
to their inability to account for the alert processing capacity. Ideally, alert
threshold selection enables the system to maximize the fraud detection while
balancing the upstream fraud scores and the available bandwidth of the alert
processing teams. However, in practice, fixed thresholds that are used for
their simplicity do not have this ability. In this paper, we propose an
enhanced threshold selection policy for fraud alert systems. The proposed
approach formulates the threshold selection as a sequential decision making
problem and uses Deep Q-Network based reinforcement learning. Experimental
results show that this adaptive approach outperforms the current static
solutions by reducing the fraud losses as well as improving the operational
efficiency of the alert system.

Firstly, by tuning the height of an enclosing photonic cavity, we can lower the
energy level of the symmetric `bright' mode underneath that of the
anti-symmetric `dark' mode. This is possible due to the polaritonic nature of
the symmetric mode, that shares simultaneously its excitation with the cavity
and the dimer. For a heterogeneous dimer, we show that the polariton modes can
be smoothly tuned from symmetric to anti-symmetric, resulting in a variable
mode localisation from extended throughout the cavity to concentrated around
the vicinity of the dimer. In addition, we reveal a critical point where one of
the meta-atoms becomes `shrouded', with no response to a driving electric
field, and thus the field re-radiated by the dimer is only that of the other
meta-atom. We provide an exact analytical description of the system from first
principles, as well as full-wave electromagnetic simulations that show a strong
quantitative agreement with the analytical model. Our description is relevant
for any physical dimer where dipolar interactions are the dominant mechanism.

magnetic resonances including both fundamental dipoles and high-order
multipoles, leading to ideal asymmetrical scattering pattern for redistributing
the energy between the diffraction channels at will. The participation of
quadrupole and hexapole not only significantly enhance the working efficiency,

negative refraction and reflection are demonstrated with almost unity
efficiency under both polarizations. Compared with conventional metasurfaces,
such an all-dielectric mategrating has the merits of high flexibility, high

are promising platforms for quantum communications and sensing. The presence of
avoided crossings between the electronic levels of these defects can
substantially alter their quantum dynamics and be both detrimental and
beneficial for quantum information applications. Avoided crossings give rise to
clock transitions, which can significantly improve protection from magnetic
noise and favorably increase coherence time. However, the reduced coupling
between electronic and nuclear spins at an avoided crossing may be detrimental
to applications where nuclear spins act as quantum memories. Here we present a
combined theoretical and experimental study of the quantum dynamics of
paramagnetic defects interacting with a nuclear spin bath at avoided crossings.
We develop a computational approach based on a generalization of the cluster
expansion technique, which can account for processes beyond pure dephasing and
describe the dynamics of any solid-state spin-qubits near avoided crossings.
Using this approach and experimental validation, we determine the change in
nature and source of noise at avoided crossings for divacancies in SiC. We find
that we can condition the clock transition of the divacancies in SiC on
multiple adjacent nuclear spins states. In our experiments, we demonstrate that
one can suppress the effects of fluctuating charge impurities with depletion
techniques, leading to an increased coherence time at clock transition, limited

conversations take place concurrently. Interleaved conversations lead to
difficulties in not only following the ongoing discussions but also extracting
relevant information from simultaneous messages. Conversation disentanglement
aims to separate intermingled messages into detached conversations. However,
existing disentanglement methods rely mostly on handcrafted features that are
dataset specific, which hinders generalization and adaptability. In this work,
we propose an end-to-end online framework for conversation disentanglement that
avoids time-consuming domain-specific feature engineering. We design a novel
way to embed the whole utterance that comprises timestamp, speaker, and message
text, and proposes a custom attention mechanism that models disentanglement as
a pointing problem while effectively capturing inter-utterance interactions in
an end-to-end fashion. We also introduce a joint-learning objective to better
capture contextual information. Our experiments on the Ubuntu IRC dataset show
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both link and
conversation prediction tasks.

Results show excellent agreement with those of trained experts in terms of

extendable to other computer vision medical applications and to problems

The irregularity of such data violates some key assumptions used in almost all

guarantees. To better understand this type of challenges, we provide in this
paper a comprehensive study of DP-SCO under various settings. First, we
consider the case where the loss function is strongly convex and smooth. For
this case, we propose a method based on the sample-and-aggregate framework,
which has an excess population risk of $\tilde{O}(\frac{d^3}{n\epsilon^4})$
(after omitting other factors), where $n$ is the sample size and $d$ is the
dimensionality of the data. Then, we show that with some additional assumptions
on the loss functions, it is possible to reduce the \textit{expected} excess
population risk to $\tilde{O}(\frac{ d^2}{ n\epsilon^2 })$. To lift these
additional conditions, we also provide a gradient smoothing and trimming based
scheme to achieve excess population risks of $\tilde{O}(\frac{

$\tilde{O}(\frac{d^\frac{2}{3}}{(n\epsilon^2)^\frac{1}{3}})$ for strongly

matrix algebra. A \emph{generalized inverse} of a real matrix $A$ is a matrix
$H$ that satisfies the Moore-Penrose (M-P) property $AHA=A$. If $H$ also
satisfies the M-P property $HAH=H$, then it is called \emph{reflexive}.
Reflexivity of a generalized inverse is equivalent to minimum rank, a highly
desirable property. We consider aspects of symmetry related to the calculation
of various \emph{sparse} reflexive generalized inverses of $A$. As is common,
we use (vector) 1-norm minimization for both inducing sparsity and for keeping
the magnitude of entries under control.
  When $A$ is symmetric, a symmetric $H$ is highly desirable, but generally
such a restriction on $H$ will not lead to a 1-norm minimizing reflexive
generalized inverse. We investigate a block construction method to produce a
symmetric reflexive generalized inverse that is structured and has guaranteed
sparsity. Letting the rank of $A$ be $r$, we establish that the 1-norm
minimizing generalized inverse of this type is a 1-norm minimizing symmetric
generalized inverse when (i) $r=1$ and when (ii) $r=2$ and $A$ is nonnegative.
  Another aspect of symmetry that we consider relates to another M-P property:
$H$ is \emph{ah-symmetric} if $AH$ is symmetric. The ah-symmetry property is
sufficient for a generalized inverse to be used to solve the least-squares
problem $\min\{\|Ax-b\|_2:~x\in\mathbb{R}^n\}$ using $H$, via $x:=Hb$. We
investigate a column block construction method to produce an ah-symmetric
reflexive generalized inverse that is structured and has guaranteed sparsity.
We establish that the 1-norm minimizing ah-symmetric generalized inverse of

where only classification confidence of a victim model is available. Inspired
by consistency of visual saliency between different vision models, a surrogate
model is expected to improve the attack performance via transferability. By
combining transferability-based and query-based black-box attack, we propose a
surprisingly simple baseline approach (named SimBA++) using the surrogate
model, which significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art methods.
Moreover, to efficiently utilize the query feedback, we update the surrogate
model in a novel learning scheme, named High-Order Gradient Approximation
(HOGA). By constructing a high-order gradient computation graph, we update the
surrogate model to approximate the victim model in both forward and backward
pass. The SimBA++ and HOGA result in Learnable Black-Box Attack (LeBA), which
surpasses previous state of the art by considerable margins: the proposed LeBA
significantly reduces queries, while keeping higher attack success rates close
to 100% in extensive ImageNet experiments, including attacking vision
benchmarks and defensive models. Code is open source at

cooperative driving. Given the increasing rate of connectivity in modern
vehicles, and road infrastructure, cooperative driving is a promising first
step in automated driving. The example scenario we explored in this paper, is
coordinated lane merge, with data collection, test and evaluation all conducted
in an automotive test track. The assumption is that vehicles are a mix of those
equipped with communication units on board, i.e. connected vehicles, and those
that are not connected. However, roadside cameras are connected and can capture
all vehicles including those without connectivity. We develop a Traffic
Orchestrator that suggests trajectories based on these two sources of
information, i.e. connected vehicles, and connected roadside cameras.
Recommended trajectories are built, which are then communicated back to the
connected vehicles. We explore the use of different machine learning techniques
in accurately and timely prediction of trajectories.

Previous computational models of brain capillary networks have predicted that
heterogeneous cerebral capillary flow patterns result in lower brain tissue
partial oxygen pressures. It has been suggested that this may lead to number of
diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, acute ischemic stroke, traumatic brain
injury and ischemic heart disease. We have previously developed a computational
model that was used to describe in detail the effect of flow heterogeneities on
tissue oxygen levels. The main result in that paper was that, for a general
class of capillary networks, perturbations of segment diameters or conductances
always lead to decreased oxygen levels. This result was verified using both
numerical simulations and mathematical analysis. However, the analysis depended
on a novel conjecture concerning the Laplace operator of functions related to
the segment flow rates and how they depend on the conductances. The goal of
this paper is to give a mathematically rigorous proof of the conjecture for a
general class of networks. The proof depends on determining the number of trees
and forests in certain graphs arising from the capillary network.

of the incoming particles, are highlighted. Thereafter, the notion of symmetry
and its application to the non-relativistic Schrodinger equation have been
delineated. The demand for U(1) gauge invariance and the resulting `gauge
miracle', that automatically leads to the correct interaction terms describing
the electromagnetic force between the charge particles and the field, have been
elaborated upon. A simple treatment, but with explicit derivation, of the
Aharonov-Bohm effect, is presented, that underlines a strange phenomena -
sites, impenetrable by charge particles but are threaded with magnetic field
lines, conspire with a `Trojan Horse', namely the magnetic vector potential
outside, to cause measurable shift in the double-slit interference fringes.
This shift in the interference pattern is non-classical since the charge
particles move in field-free regions. The crucial Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phase that
makes its entry in the above bizarre effect is also deployed to derive the
observed magnetic flux quantisation in superconductors as well as the Dirac
result which implies that the existence of a single magnetic monopole anywhere
in the universe would entail quantisation of the product of a particle's
electric charge and the monopole's magnetic charge. Nontrivial consequences of
AB phase follow whenever the physical region accessible, from the point of view
of the wavefunction of a charge particle, is multiply-connected.

suite of output distribution parameterizations that incorporate latent
variables to add expressivity and better fit the natural distribution of
numeric values in running text, and combine them with both recurrent and
transformer-based encoder architectures. We evaluate these models on two
numeric datasets in the financial and scientific domain. Our findings show that
output distributions that incorporate discrete latent variables and allow for
multiple modes outperform simple flow-based counterparts on all datasets,
yielding more accurate numerical prediction and anomaly detection. We also show
that our models effectively utilize textual con-text and benefit from
general-purpose unsupervised pretraining.

signals with second-order nonlinear media. For the optical signal, this
interaction can be strongly enhanced by using dielectric slot-waveguide
structures that exploit a field discontinuity at the interface between a
high-index waveguide core and the low-index EO cladding. In contrast to this,
the electrical signal is usually applied through conductive regions in the
direct vicinity of the optical waveguide. To avoid excessive optical loss, the
conductivity of these regions is maintained at a moderate level, thus leading
to inherent RC-limitations of the modulation bandwidth. In this paper, we show
that these limitations can be overcome by extending the slot-waveguide concept
to the modulating radio-frequency (RF) signal. Our device combines an RF
slotline that relies on BaTiO3 as a high-k dielectric material with a
conventional silicon photonic slot waveguide and a highly efficient organic EO
cladding material. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrate a 1 mm-long
Mach-Zehnder modulator that offers a 3 dB-bandwidth of 76 GHz and a 6
dB-bandwidth of 110 GHz along with a small {\pi}-voltage of 1.3 V (U{\pi}L =
1.3 V mm). To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest EO
bandwidth so far achieved with a silicon photonic modulator based on dielectric
waveguides. We further demonstrate the viability of the device in a data
transmission experiment using four-state pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM4) at
line rates up to 200 Gbit/s. Our first-generation devices leave vast room for
further improvement and may open an attractive route towards highly efficient
silicon photonic modulators that combine sub-1 mm device lengths with sub-1 V
drive voltages and modulation bandwidths of more than 100 GHz.
