the accuracy and efficiency of the transformation from noisy resource states to
pure ones (e.g.,~distillation) in any well-behaved quantum resource theory
[Fang/Liu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 060405 (2020)]. Here, we develop a novel and
powerful method for analyzing the limitations on quantum resource purification,
which not only leads to improved bounds that rule out exact purification for a
broader range of noisy states and are tight in certain cases, but also enable
us to establish a robust no-purification theory for quantum channel (dynamical)
resources. More specifically, we employ the new method to derive universal
bounds on the error and cost of transforming generic noisy channels (where
multiple instances can be used adaptively, in contrast to the state theory) to
some unitary resource channel under any free channel-to-channel map. We address
several cases of practical interest in more concrete terms, and discuss the
connections and applications of our general results to distillation, quantum
error correction, quantum Shannon theory, and quantum circuit synthesis.

intelligent exploitation of the information in the panel. Our methodology is
completed by support vector machine procedures to estimate magnitude and form

explore the trade-off between accuracy and robustness. This paper asks this new
question: how to quickly calibrate a trained model in-situ, to examine the
achievable trade-offs between its standard and robust accuracies, without
(re-)training it many times? Our proposed framework, Once-for-all Adversarial
Training (OAT), is built on an innovative model-conditional training framework,
with a controlling hyper-parameter as the input. The trained model could be
adjusted among different standard and robust accuracies ""for free"" at testing

standard and adversarial feature statistics, so that they can be learned in one
model without degrading performance. We further extend OAT to a Once-for-all
Adversarial Training and Slimming (OATS) framework, that allows for the joint
trade-off among accuracy, robustness and runtime efficiency. Experiments show
that, without any re-training nor ensembling, OAT/OATS achieve similar or even

Coulomb interaction is taken into account, this ferromagnet can appeal either
to the spin degree of freedom or equivalently to the valley pseudo-spin degree
of freedom. This freedom in choice is then limited by subleading energy scales
that explicitly break the SU(4) symmetry, the simplest of which is given by the
Zeeman effect that orients the spin in the direction of the magnetic field. In
addition, there are also valley symmetry breaking terms that can arise from
short-range interactions or electron-phonon couplings. Here, we build upon the
phase diagram, which has been obtained by Kharitonov [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{85},
155439 (2012)], in order to identify the different skyrmions that are
compatible with these types of quantum-Hall ferromagnets. Similarly to the
ferromagnets, the skyrmions at charge neutrality are described by the
$\text{Gr}(2,4)$ Grassmannian at the center, which allows us to construct the
skyrmion spinors. The different skyrmion types are then obtained by minimizing
their energy within a variational approach, with respect to the remaining free
parameters that are not fixed by the requirement that the skyrmion at large
distances from their center must be compatible with the ferromagnetic
background. We show that the different skyrmion types have a clear signature in
the local, sublattice-resolved, spin magnetization, which is in principle

is decentralized and the joint estimate can only be computed after the task
ends by fusing observations of all agents. The objective is to maximize the
accuracy of the estimate. The accuracy is quantified by a centralized
prediction reward determined by a centralized decision-maker who perceives the
observations gathered by all agents after the task ends. In this paper, we
model multi-agent active perception as a decentralized partially observable
Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) with a convex centralized prediction
reward. We prove that by introducing individual prediction actions for each
agent, the problem is converted into a standard Dec-POMDP with a decentralized
prediction reward. The loss due to decentralization is bounded, and we give a
sufficient condition for when it is zero. Our results allow application of any
Dec-POMDP solution algorithm to multi-agent active perception problems, and
enable planning to reduce uncertainty without explicit computation of joint

Particle Tracking Velocimetry (APTV) can be utilized to measure suspensions
dynamics. Measurements were successfully performed in monodisperse, refractive
index matched suspensions of up to a volume fraction of $\Phi=19.9\%$. For
this, a small percentage of the particles is labeled with fluorescent dye
acting as tracers for the particle tracking procedure. Calibration results
show, that a slight deviation of the refractive index of liquid and particles
leads to a strong shape change of the calibration curve with respect to the
unladen case. This effect becomes more severe along the channel height. To
compensate the shape change of the calibration curves the interpolation
technique developed by Brockmann et al. (Experiments in Fluids, 61(2), 67,
\citeyear{brockmann2020utilizing}) is adapted. Using this technique, the
interpolation procedure is applied to suspensions with 6 different volume
fractions ranging from $\Phi<0.01\%$ to $\Phi=19.9\%$. To determine the effect
of volume fraction on the perfomance of the method, the depth reconstruction
error $\sigma_z$ and the measurement volume depth $\Delta z$, obtained in
different calibration measurements, are estimated. Here, a relative position
reconstruction accuracy of $\sigma_z$/$\Delta z$=0.90\% and $\sigma_z$/$\Delta
z$=2.53\% is achieved for labeled calibration particles in dilute

respectively. The measurement technique is validated for a laminar flow in a
straight rectangular channel with a cross-sectional area of

9.04\% and 22.57\% for the out-of-plane velocity with respect to the maximum

maximum at the frequency of the selected mode. The linewidth of scattered light
is much smaller than that of the spontaneous emission of a single atom,

paucity of sufficient word occurrences in such posts, classification of this

additional cues in the form of past labels and times associated with the post

To address this problem, we propose models based on the Hawkes process (HP)
which can naturally incorporate the temporal features and past labels along
with textual features for improving short text classification. In particular,
we propose a discriminative approach to model text in HP where the text
features parameterize the base intensity and/or the triggering kernel. Another
major contribution is to consider kernel to be a function of both time and

modelling and effectively learning the text along with the historical
influences for tweet classification. We demonstrate the advantages of the
proposed techniques on standard benchmarks for rumour stance classification.

if such models can stray so far from an initial self-supervision objective, a
wayward model might generalize in undesirable ways too, say to nonsensical

language models trained on (positive) training data also generalize to

extent to which language models learn undesirable properties of text, such as
n-grams, that might interfere with the learning of more desirable properties of

ability to generalize to negative n-gram data, indicating standard
self-supervision generalizes too far. We propose a form of inductive bias that
attenuates such undesirable signals with negative data distributions

modeled as compartmental models, in which the population under study is divided
into compartments and has assumptions about the nature and time rate of
transfer from one compartment to another. Usually, they are composed of a
system of ordinary differential equations (ODE's) in time. A class of such
models considers the Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, and Deceased

the formulation of SEIRD compartmental models to diffusion-reaction systems of

introduce a source term to the equation system, representing exposed people who

diffusion. We implement the whole model in \texttt{libMesh}, an open finite

adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. Therefore, the model can represent
several spatial scales, adapting the resolution to the disease dynamics. We

from NASA's Kepler mission have revealed a bimodality in the radius
distribution of these objects, with a relative underabundance of planets
between 1.5 and 2.0 $R_{\oplus}$. This bimodality suggests that sub-Neptunes
are mostly rocky planets that were born with primary atmospheres a few percent
by mass accreted from the protoplanetary nebula. Planets above the radius gap
were able to retain their atmospheres (""gas-rich super-Earths""), while planets
below the radius gap lost their atmospheres and are stripped cores (""true

the difficulties inherent in sentence-level rephrasing as well as the problem
of setting the criteria for legitimate rewriting.
  In this paper, we explore the problem of creating adversarial examples with
sentence-level rewriting. We design a new sampling method, named
ParaphraseSampler, to efficiently rewrite the original sentence in multiple
ways. Then we propose a new criteria for modification, called a sentence-level
threaten model. This criteria allows for both word- and sentence-level changes,
and can be adjusted independently in two dimensions: semantic similarity and
grammatical quality. Experimental results show that many of these rewritten

ParaphraseSampler achieves a better attack success rate than our baseline.

data centers and 5G networks. In an SDN network, routing and traffic management
decisions are made by a centralized controller and communicated to switches via
a control channel. Transport Layer Security (TLS) has been proposed as its
single security layer; however, use of TLS is optional and connections are
still vulnerable to downgrade attacks. In this paper, we propose the
strengthening of security assurance using a protocol dialecting approach to
provide additional and customizable security. We consider and evaluate two
dialecting approaches for OpenFlow protocol operation, adding per-message
authentication to the SDN control channel that is independent of TLS and
provides robustness against downgrade attacks in the optional case of TLS

dialecting primitives in a Mininet experiment. The results show a modest

recently common to evaluate the loss using the permutation invariant training

between $N$ ground truths and $N$ estimates. Since the factorial complexity
explodes very rapidly as $N$ increases, a PIT-based training works only when
the number of source signals is small, such as $N = 2$ or $3$. To overcome this
limitation, this paper proposes a SinkPIT, a novel variant of the PIT losses,
which is much more efficient than the ordinary PIT loss when $N$ is large. The
SinkPIT is based on Sinkhorn's matrix balancing algorithm, which efficiently
finds a doubly stochastic matrix which approximates the best permutation in a

preserved within a certain error, and then iteratively approximate CoSimRank
values in the k-dimensional subspace in O(n^2k) time. Theoretically,

problems) by considering an asymptotic expansion of the Laplace transformed
probability flux into each target. The latter determines the distribution of
arrival or capture times into an individual target, conditioned on the set of
events that result in capture by that target. A characteristic feature of
strongly localized perturbations in 2D is that matched asymptotics generates a
series expansion in $\nu=-1/\ln \epsilon$ rather than $\epsilon$,

to the size of the search domain. Moreover, it is possible to sum over all

method for obtaining corresponding asymptotic expansions of the splitting

(CI) relationships among parameters are a crucial aspect of probabilistic
models that capture a qualitative summary of the specified model and can
facilitate more efficient inference. We present an information flow type system
for probabilistic programming that captures conditional independence (CI)
relationships, and show that, for a well-typed program in our system, the
distribution it implements is guaranteed to have certain CI-relationships.
Further, by using type inference, we can statically deduce which CI-properties
are present in a specified model. As a practical application, we consider the
problem of how to perform inference on models with mixed discrete and
continuous parameters. Inference on such models is challenging in many existing
PPLs, but can be improved through a workaround, where the discrete parameters
are used implicitly, at the expense of manual model re-writing. We present a
source-to-source semantics-preserving transformation, which uses our CI-type
system to automate this workaround by eliminating the discrete parameters from
a probabilistic program. The resulting program can be seen as a hybrid
inference algorithm on the original program, where continuous parameters can be
drawn using efficient gradient-based inference methods, while the discrete

irrational algebraic numbers is 2, and the same holds true over function fields
in characteristic zero, some counter-examples were found over function fields
in positive characteristic. This was put forward first by Mahler in 1949, in
his fundamental paper on Diophantine approximation \cite{M}. It seems that,
except for particular elements, as power series with bounded partial quotients,
Roth's theorem holds. Until now, only one element, with unbounded partial
quotients, discovered by Mills and Robbins \cite{MR} in 1986, has been
recognized having this property. It concerns a quartic power series over
$\mathbb{F}_{3}$ having a continued fraction expansion with remarkable pattern.
This continued fraction expansion was explicitly described by Buck and Robbins
\cite{BR}, and later by Lasjaunias \cite{LA2} who used another method somewhat
easier. Furthermore, Lasjaunias \cite{LA2} improve the value of its
irrationality measure in relation with Roth's theorem. We will see that this
power series is included in a large quartic power series family, for which the
continued fraction expansion and the irrationality measure can be explicitly
given. Moreover, we will study the rational approximation of other examples of
quartic power series over $\mathbb{F}_{3}$ and we will extend the set of
counter-examples initiated by Mahler.

one of the most time consuming steps. Although Versatile Place and Route (VPR),
which is a commonly used algorithm for this purpose, routes effectively, it is
slow in execution. One way to accelerate this design flow is to use
parallelization. Since VPR is intrinsically sequential, a set of parallel
algorithms have been recently proposed for this purpose (ParaLaR and
ParaLarPD).
  These algorithms formulate the routing process as a Linear Program (LP) and
solve it using the Lagrange relaxation, the sub-gradient method, and the
Steiner tree algorithm. Out of the many metrics available to check the
effectiveness of routing, ParaLarPD, which is an improved version of ParaLaR,
suffers from large violations in the constraints of the LP problem (which is
related to the minimum channel width metric) as well as an easily measurable
critical path delay metric that can be improved further.
  In this paper, we introduce a set of novel Lagrange heuristics that improve
the Lagrange relaxation process. When tested on the MCNC benchmark circuits, on
an average, this leads to halving of the constraints violation, up to 10%
improvement in the minimum channel width, and up to 8% reduction in the
critical path delay as obtained from ParaLarPD. We term our new algorithm as
ParaLarH. Due to the increased work in the Lagrange relaxation process, as
compared to ParaLarPD, ParaLarH does slightly deteriorate the speedup obtained
because of parallelization, however, this aspect is easily compensated by using
more number of threads.

to guide the learning of (causal) sequential decision making strategies. The
hope is that offline reinforcement learning coupled with function approximation
methods (to deal with the curse of dimensionality) can provide a means to help
alleviate the excessive sample complexity burden in modern sequential decision
making problems. However, the extent to which this broader approach can be
effective is not well understood, where the literature largely consists of
sufficient conditions.
  This work focuses on the basic question of what are necessary
representational and distributional conditions that permit provable
sample-efficient offline reinforcement learning. Perhaps surprisingly, our main
result shows that even if: i) we have realizability in that the true value
function of \emph{every} policy is linear in a given set of features and 2) our
off-policy data has good coverage over all features (under a strong spectral
condition), then any algorithm still (information-theoretically) requires a
number of offline samples that is exponential in the problem horizon in order
to non-trivially estimate the value of \emph{any} given policy. Our results
highlight that sample-efficient offline policy evaluation is simply not
possible unless significantly stronger conditions hold; such conditions include
either having low distribution shift (where the offline data distribution is
close to the distribution of the policy to be evaluated) or significantly
stronger representational conditions (beyond realizability).

sensitive to the $\mathcal{O}(v^2)$ NRQCD matrix elements. With the appropriate

gained popularity recently for tracking and localization applications. It uses
Monte Carlo simulation and has proven to be a very reliable technique to model
non-Gaussian and non-linear elements of physical systems. Particle filters
outperform various other traditional filters like Kalman filters in
non-Gaussian and non-linear settings due to their non-analytical and
non-parametric nature. However, a significant drawback of particle filters is
their computational complexity, which inhibits their use in real-time
applications with conventional CPU or DSP based implementation schemes. This
paper proposes a modification to the existing particle filter algorithm and
presents a highspeed and dedicated hardware architecture. The architecture
incorporates pipelining and parallelization in the design to reduce execution
time considerably. The design is validated for a source localization problem
wherein we estimate the position of a source in real-time using the particle
filter algorithm implemented on hardware. The validation setup relies on an
Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) with a photodiode housing on top to sense and
localize a light source. We have prototyped the design using Artix-7
field-programmable gate array (FPGA), and resource utilization for the proposed
system is presented. Further, we show the execution time and estimation
accuracy of the high-speed architecture and observe a significant reduction in
computational time. Our implementation of particle filters on FPGA is scalable
and modular, with a low execution time of about 5.62 us for processing 1024
particles and can be deployed for real-time applications.

general purpose robotic agents. However, a core challenge in this paradigm lies
in collecting large amounts of meaningful data, while not depending on a human
in the loop for data collection. One way to address this challenge is through
task-agnostic exploration, where an agent attempts to explore without a
task-specific reward function, and collect data that can be useful for any
downstream task. While these approaches have shown some promise in simple
domains, they often struggle to explore the relevant regions of the state space
in more challenging settings, such as vision based robotic manipulation. This
challenge stems from an objective that encourages exploring everything in a
potentially vast state space. To mitigate this challenge, we propose to focus
exploration on the important parts of the state space using weak human
supervision. Concretely, we propose an exploration technique, Batch Exploration
with Examples (BEE), that explores relevant regions of the state-space, guided
by a modest number of human provided images of important states. These human
provided images only need to be collected once at the beginning of data
collection and can be collected in a matter of minutes, allowing us to scalably
collect diverse datasets, which can then be combined with any batch RL
algorithm. We find that BEE is able to tackle challenging vision-based
manipulation tasks both in simulation and on a real Franka robot, and observe
that compared to task-agnostic and weakly-supervised exploration techniques, it
(1) interacts more than twice as often with relevant objects, and (2) improves
downstream task performance when used in conjunction with offline RL.

Gierer-Meinhardt (GM) model, one can consider the singular limit $D_a\ll D_h$,
where $D_a$ and $D_h$ are the diffusivities of the activator and inhibitor,
respectively. Asymptotic analysis can then be used to analyze the existence and
linear stability of multi-spike solutions. In this paper, we analyze
multi-spike solutions in a hybrid reaction-transport model, consisting of a
slowly diffusing activator and an actively transported inhibitor that switches
at a rate $\alpha$ between right-moving and left-moving velocity states. This
class of model was recently introduced to account for the formation and
homeostatic regulation of synaptic puncta during larval development in {\em C.

exact mapping between states in $\mathcal{H}_\pm$ and geometries of droplets.
In particular, coherent states in $\mathcal{H}_\pm$ correspond to classical
deformation of upper and lower Fermi surfaces. We prove that correlation
between two coherent states in $\mathcal{H}_\pm$ is equal to the chiral and
anti-chiral partition function of $2d$ Yang-Mills theory on a cylinder. Using
the fact that the full Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_+ \otimes \mathcal{H}_-$

vacuous. Focusing on generalization bounds, this work addresses the question of
how to evaluate such bounds empirically. Jiang et al. (2020) recently described

a deduction method for computing the function's output on a given input, and an
abduction method for computing the function's inputs for a given output; the
neural module exposes a deduction method for computing the function's output on

practical machine learning systems that deal with sensitive customer data. A
popular approach for privacy-preserving text analysis is noise injection, in
which text data is first mapped into a continuous embedding space, perturbed by
sampling a spherical noise from an appropriate distribution, and then projected
back to the discrete vocabulary space. While this allows the perturbation to
admit the required metric differential privacy, often the utility of downstream
tasks modeled on this perturbed data is low because the spherical noise does
not account for the variability in the density around different words in the
embedding space. In particular, words in a sparse region are likely unchanged
even when the noise scale is large. %Using the global sensitivity of the
mechanism can potentially add too much noise to the words in the dense regions
of the embedding space, causing a high utility loss, whereas using local
sensitivity can leak information through the scale of the noise added.
  In this paper, we propose a text perturbation mechanism based on a carefully
designed regularized variant of the Mahalanobis metric to overcome this
problem. For any given noise scale, this metric adds an elliptical noise to
account for the covariance structure in the embedding space. This heterogeneity
in the noise scale along different directions helps ensure that the words in
the sparse region have sufficient likelihood of replacement without sacrificing
the overall utility. We provide a text-perturbation algorithm based on this
metric and formally prove its privacy guarantees. Additionally, we empirically
show that our mechanism improves the privacy statistics to achieve the same
level of utility as compared to the state-of-the-art Laplace mechanism.

might be other sources for which we do not have reliable models. Some are

totally unanticipated. So far, no unmodeled sources have been discovered, but
the lack of models makes the search for such sources much more difficult and
less sensitive. We present here a search for unmodeled GW signals using
semi-supervised machine learning. We apply deep learning and outlier detection
algorithms to labeled spectrograms of GW strain data, and then search for
spectrograms with anomalous patterns in public LIGO data. We searched $\sim
13\%$ of the coincident data from the first two observing runs. No candidates
of GW signals were detected in the data analyzed. We evaluate the sensitivity
of the search using simulated signals, we show that this search can detect
spectrograms containing unusual or unexpected GW patterns, and we report the

NANOGrav dataset, injecting a wide range of stochastic gravitational wave
background (GWB) signals that encompass a variety of amplitudes and spectral
shapes, and quantify three key milestones: (I) Given the amplitude measured in
the 12.5 yr analysis and assuming this signal is a GWB, we expect to accumulate
robust evidence of an interpulsar-correlated GWB signal with 15--17 yrs of
data, i.e., an additional 2--5 yrs from the 12.5 yr dataset; (II) At the
initial detection, we expect a fractional uncertainty of $40\%$ on the
power-law strain spectrum slope, which is sufficient to distinguish a GWB of
supermassive black-hole binary origin from some models predicting more exotic
origins;(III) Similarly, the measured GWB amplitude will have an uncertainty of
$44\%$ upon initial detection, allowing us to arbitrate between some population
models of supermassive black-hole binaries. In addition, power-law models are
distinguishable from those having low-frequency spectral turnovers once 20~yrs
of data are reached. Even though our study is based on the NANOGrav data, we
also derive relations that allow for a generalization to other pulsar-timing
array datasets. Most notably, by combining the data of individual arrays into
the International Pulsar Timing Array, all of these milestones can be reached
significantly earlier.

tertiary companions constitute an important class of dynamical formation
channels for compact binaries detected by LIGO/VIRGO. Recent works have
examined numerically the combined orbital and spin dynamics of BH binaries that
undergo large Lidov-Kozai (LK) eccentricity oscillations induced by a highly
inclined companion and merge via gravitational wave radiation. However, the
extreme eccentricity variations make such systems difficult to characterize
analytically. In this paper, we develop an analytical formalism for
understanding the spin dynamics of binary BHs undergoing LK-induced mergers. We
show that, under certain conditions, the eccentricity oscillations of the
binary can be averaged over to determine the long-term behavior of the BH spin
in a smooth way. In particular, we demonstrate that the final spin-orbit
misalignment angle $\theta_{\rm sl}$ is often related to the binary's
primordial spin orientation through an approximate adiabatic invariant. Our
theory explains the ""$90^\circ$ attractor"" (as found in recent numerical
studies) for the evolution of $\theta_{\rm sl}$ when the initial BH spin is
aligned with the orbital axis and the octupole LK effects are negligible --
such a ""$90^\circ$ attractor"" would lead to a small binary effective spin
parameter $\chi_{\rm eff}\sim 0$ even for large intrinsic BH spins. We
calculate the deviation from adiabaticity in closed form as a function of the
initial conditions. We also place accurate constraints on when this adiabatic
invariant breaks down due to resonant spin-orbit interactions. We consider both
stellar-mass and supermassive BH tertiary companions, and provide simple
prescriptions for determining analytically the final spin-orbit misalignment
angles of the merging BH binaries.

ionizing region and the mid-infrared (MIR) dust echoes, can be interpreted as a
hint on AGN evolution. Here we present a catalog of 88 AGN candidates showing
hints on the fading and rising of their activity in the nearby Universe. We use
AGN scaling relations to select them from an initial sample of 877 candidates
using publicly available optical, X-ray, and MIR luminosities. We then use the
multi-wavelength information to discard sources contaminated with extranuclear
emission and those with an X-ray luminosity not well corrected for absorption.
We find that 96% of our candidates are fading sources. This result suggests a
scenario where the Universe had its peak of AGN activity somewhere in the past
and is dominated by a fading phase at the present time. Alternatively, the
fading phase is longer than the rising phase, which is consistent with galaxy
merger simulations. Around 50% of these fading candidates are associated with
merging or interacting systems. Finally, we also find the existence of jets in
~30% of these candidates and that the preferred AGN dust geometry is

analogue of the $Y$-parameter. This allows the scaling relations in $f(R)$
gravity to be mapped to their $\Lambda$CDM counterparts to within a few
percent. We confirm that a simple analytical tanh formula for the ratio between
the dynamical and true masses of haloes in chameleon $f(R)$ gravity, proposed
and calibrated using dark-matter-only simulations in a previous work, works
equally well for haloes identified in simulations with two very different --
full-physics and non-radiative -- baryonic models. The mappings of scaling
relations can be computed using this tanh formula, which depends on the halo
mass, redshift and size of the background scalar field, also at a very good
accuracy. Our results can be used for accurate determination of the cluster
mass using SZ and X-ray observables, and will form part of a general framework
for unbiased and self-consistent tests of gravity using data from present and
upcoming galaxy cluster surveys. We also propose an alternative test of
gravity, using the $Y_{\rm X}$-temperature relation, which does not involve
mass calibration.

extremely low gas surface densities. Star formation in these regions, where the
interstellar medium is dominated by diffuse atomic hydrogen, is difficult to
explain with classic star formation theories. In this letter, we introduce
runaway stars as an explanation for this observation. Runaway stars, produced
by collisional dynamics in young stellar clusters, can travel kiloparsecs
during their main-sequence lifetime. Using galactic-scale hydrodynamic
simulations including a treatment of individual stars, we demonstrate that this
mechanism enables the ejection of young massive stars into environments where
the gas is not dense enough to trigger star formation. This results in the
appearance of star formation in regions where it ought to be impossible. We
conclude that runaway stars are a contributing, if not dominant, factor to the
observations of star formation in the outskirts of spiral galaxies.

applies a consistency loss to penalize differences between a model's
predictions on (a) observed (unlabeled) examples; and (b) corresponding
'noised' examples produced via data augmentation. While UDA has gained
popularity for text classification, open questions linger over which design
decisions are necessary and over how to extend the method to sequence labeling
tasks. This method has recently gained traction for text classification. In
this paper, we re-examine UDA and demonstrate its efficacy on several
sequential tasks. Our main contribution is an empirical study of UDA to
establish which components of the algorithm confer benefits in NLP. Notably,
although prior work has emphasized the use of clever augmentation techniques
including back-translation, we find that enforcing consistency between
predictions assigned to observed and randomly substituted words often yields
comparable (or greater) benefits compared to these complex perturbation models.
Furthermore, we find that applying its consistency loss affords meaningful
gains without any unlabeled data at all, i.e., in a standard supervised
setting. In short: UDA need not be unsupervised, and does not require complex
data augmentation to be effective.

and automatically generates coordinated combinations of charts, in contrast to
existing systems that primarily focus on singleton visual encodings of tabular
datasets. We automatically detect linkages across multiple input datasets by
analyzing non-numeric attribute fields, creating an entity graph within which
we analyze and rank paths. For each high-ranking path, we specify chart
combinations with spatial and color alignments between shared fields, using a
gradual binding approach to transform initial partial specifications of
singleton charts to complete specifications that are aligned and oriented
consistently. A novel aspect of our approach is its combination of
domain-agnostic elements with domain-specific information that is captured
through a domain-specific visualization prevalence design space. Our
implementation is applied to both synthetic data and real data from an Ebola
outbreak. We compare GEViTRec's output to what previous visualization
recommendation systems would generate, and to manually crafted visualizations

(DBM), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
and Autoregressive GAN, on learning quantum data set generated by deep random
circuits. We demonstrate the leading performance of LSTM in learning quantum
samples, and thus the autoregressive structure present in the underlying
quantum distribution from random quantum circuits. Both numerical experiments
and a theoretical proof in the case of the DBM show exponentially growing
complexity of learning-agent parameters required for achieving a fixed accuracy
as n increases. Finally, we establish a connection between learnability and the
complexity of generative models by benchmarking learnability against different
sets of samples drawn from probability distributions of variable degrees of
complexities in their quantum and classical representations.

suppression in the electronic density of states extending above the critical
temperature - has been a long-standing mystery. Here, we employ combined
\textit{in situ} electrical transport and angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements to reveal an unprecedentedly large pseudogap
regime in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO$_3$, an interfacial superconductor where
incoherent Cooper pairs are initially formed above $T_{\Delta}$ $\approx$ 60 K,
but where a zero resistance state is only achieved below $T_{0}$ $<$ 30 K. We
show that this behavior is accompanied by distinct transport signatures of
two-dimensional phase fluctuating superconductivity, suggesting a mixed vortex
state hosting incoherent Cooper pairs which persist well above the maximum
clean limit $T_{c}$ of $\approx$ 40 K. Our work establishes the critical role
of reduced dimensionality in driving the complex interplay between Cooper
pairing and phase coherence in two-dimensional high-$T_c$ superconductors,
providing a paradigm for understanding and engineering higher-$T_{c}$
interfacial superconductors.

  Language Sequences","NAACL 2021",,,,"cs.CL cs.CV cs.LG cs.MM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human communication is multimodal in nature; it is through multiple
modalities such as language, voice, and facial expressions, that opinions and
emotions are expressed. Data in this domain exhibits complex multi-relational
and temporal interactions. Learning from this data is a fundamentally
challenging research problem. In this paper, we propose Modal-Temporal
Attention Graph (MTAG). MTAG is an interpretable graph-based neural model that
provides a suitable framework for analyzing multimodal sequential data. We
first introduce a procedure to convert unaligned multimodal sequence data into
a graph with heterogeneous nodes and edges that captures the rich interactions
across modalities and through time. Then, a novel graph fusion operation,
called MTAG fusion, along with a dynamic pruning and read-out technique, is
designed to efficiently process this modal-temporal graph and capture various
interactions. By learning to focus only on the important interactions within
the graph, MTAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal sentiment
analysis and emotion recognition benchmarks, while utilizing significantly
fewer model parameters.

experiment, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $5.0\,$fb$^{-1}$. The
branching fraction is found to be ${\mathcal{B}(B^{0}\rightarrow
D_{s}^{+}\pi^{-}) = (19.4 \pm 1.8\pm 1.3 \pm 1.2)\times 10^{-6}}$, where the
first uncertainty is statistical, the second systematic and the third is due to
the uncertainty on the $B^0 \to D^{-}\pi^{+}$, $D_{s}^{+}\rightarrow
K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{+}$ and $D^{-}\rightarrow K^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{-}$ branching
fractions. This is the most precise single measurement of this quantity to
date. As this decay proceeds through a single amplitude involving a $b \to u$
charged-current transition, the result provides information on non-factorisable
strong interaction effects and the magnitude of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa
matrix element $V_{ub}$. Additionally, the collision energy dependence of the
hadronisation-fraction ratio $f_s/f_d$ is measured through
$\bar{B}{}_{s}^{0}\rightarrow D_{s}^{+}\pi^{-}$ and $B^0 \to D^{-}\pi^{+}$
decays.

domains and generate programs unseen at training has long been acknowledged,
and datasets testing out-of-domain performance are becoming increasingly
available. However, little or no attention has been devoted to learning
algorithms or objectives which promote domain generalization, with virtually
all existing approaches relying on standard supervised learning. In this work,
we use a meta-learning framework which targets zero-shot domain generalization
for semantic parsing. We apply a model-agnostic training algorithm that
simulates zero-shot parsing by constructing virtual train and test sets from
disjoint domains. The learning objective capitalizes on the intuition that
gradient steps that improve source-domain performance should also improve
target-domain performance, thus encouraging a parser to generalize to unseen
target domains. Experimental results on the (English) Spider and Chinese Spider

and deletions, called insdel codes, with optimal trade-offs between their
redundancy and their error-correction capabilities, as well as efficient
encoding and decoding algorithms.
  In many applications, polynomial running time may still be prohibitively
expensive, which has motivated the study of codes with super-efficient decoding
algorithms. These have led to the well-studied notions of Locally Decodable
Codes (LDCs) and Locally Correctable Codes (LCCs). Inspired by these notions,
Ostrovsky and Paskin-Cherniavsky (Information Theoretic Security, 2015)
generalized Hamming LDCs to insertions and deletions. To the best of our
knowledge, these are the only known results that study the analogues of Hamming
LDCs in channels performing insertions and deletions.
  Here we continue the study of insdel codes that admit local algorithms.
Specifically, we reprove the results of Ostrovsky and Paskin-Cherniavsky for
insdel LDCs using a different set of techniques. We also observe that the
techniques extend to constructions of LCCs. Specifically, we obtain insdel LDCs
and LCCs from their Hamming LDCs and LCCs analogues, respectively. The rate and
error-correction capability blow up only by a constant factor, while the query
complexity blows up by a poly log factor in the block length.
  Since insdel locally decodable/correctble codes are scarcely studied in the
literature, we believe our results and techniques may lead to further research.
In particular, we conjecture that constant-query insdel LDCs/LCCs do not exist.

back even further to the work of Galton, Pearson, Lee, and Fisher. While
consistent estimators of the regression coefficients have been identified, the
error rates are not well-understood, especially in high dimensions.
  Under a thickness assumption about the covariance matrix of the covariates in
the revealed sample, we provide a computationally efficient estimator for the
coefficient vector $w$ from $n$ revealed samples that attains $l_2$ error
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k/n})$. Our estimator uses Projected Stochastic Gradient
Descent (PSGD) without replacement on the negative log-likelihood of the
truncated sample. For the statistically efficient estimation we only need
oracle access to the set $S$.In order to achieve computational efficiency we
need to assume that $S$ is a union of a finite number of intervals but still
can be complicated. PSGD without replacement must be restricted to an
appropriately defined convex cone to guarantee that the negative log-likelihood
is strongly convex, which in turn is established using concentration of
matrices on variables with sub-exponential tails. We perform experiments on

is one of the most critical problems in the autonomous driving domain. The
overall safety of driving and the comfort of a passenger directly depend on its
successful solution. The motion prediction problem also remains one of the most
challenging problems in autonomous driving engineering, mainly due to high
variance of the possible agent's future behavior given a situation. The two
phenomena responsible for the said variance are the multimodality caused by the
uncertainty of the agent's intent (e.g., turn right or move forward) and
uncertainty in the realization of a given intent (e.g., which lane to turn
into). To be useful within a real-time autonomous driving pipeline, a motion
prediction system must provide efficient ways to describe and quantify this
uncertainty, such as computing posterior modes and their probabilities or
estimating density at the point corresponding to a given trajectory. It also
should not put substantial density on physically impossible trajectories, as
they can confuse the system processing the predictions. In this paper, we
introduce the PRANK method, which satisfies these requirements. PRANK takes
rasterized bird-eye images of agent's surroundings as an input and extracts
features of the scene with a convolutional neural network. It then produces the
conditional distribution of agent's trajectories plausible in the given scene.
The key contribution of PRANK is a way to represent that distribution using
nearest-neighbor methods in latent trajectory space, which allows for efficient
inference in real time. We evaluate PRANK on the in-house and Argoverse

this issue in the framework of effective field theory, keeping the gauge
structure of the Standard Model (SM) unchanged. We introduce gauge-invariant
dimension-6 effective operators that couple the Higgs doublet to leptons,
thereby giving non-universal tree-level contributions to the couplings of
electroweak gauge bosons. Due to the $SU(2)_L$ gauge symmetry, a tension arises
between the $V_{us}$ measurements that are affected by new $W$ couplings, and
the electroweak precision measurements, which are also affected by the new $Z$
couplings. We show that this tension can be alleviated by allowing additional
sources of gauge-invariant couplings of $Z$ boson to left- or right-handed
leptons, and find the optimal regions indicated by the current data in the
Wilson-coefficient space. We illustrate our model-independent results with the
examples of minimal extensions of the SM involving the vector-like lepton (VLL)
models. We point out that dimension-6 operators coupling the Higgs doublet to
leptons can affect the rate of $h \to \tau \tau$ decay significantly in

heavily depend on the amount and quality of provided training data to perform
well. To this end, we developed a new method for realistic generation of
synthetic 2D+t microscopy image data of fluorescently labeled cellular nuclei.
The method combines spatiotemporal statistical shape models of different cell
cycle stages with a conditional GAN to generate time series of cell populations
and provides instance-level control of cell cycle stage and the fluorescence
intensity of generated cells. We show the effect of the GAN conditioning and
create a set of synthetic images that can be readily used for training and
benchmarking of cell segmentation and tracking approaches.

challenge in audio analysis arising in numerous applications. Our approach is
based on a key observation about human speech: there is often a short pause
between each sentence or word. In a recorded speech signal, those pauses
introduce a series of time periods during which only noise is present. We
leverage these incidental silent intervals to learn a model for automatic
speech denoising given only mono-channel audio. Detected silent intervals over
time expose not just pure noise but its time-varying features, allowing the
model to learn noise dynamics and suppress it from the speech signal.
Experiments on multiple datasets confirm the pivotal role of silent interval
detection for speech denoising, and our method outperforms several
state-of-the-art denoising methods, including those that accept only audio
input (like ours) and those that denoise based on audiovisual input (and hence
require more information). We also show that our method enjoys excellent
generalization properties, such as denoising spoken languages not seen during

dimensions of massless Lagrangians described by a symmetric rank-2 tensor and
invariant under transverse differmorphisms (TDiff). They include the linearized
Einstein-Hilbert theory, linearized unimodular gravity and scalar tensor
models. We obtain simple expressions in terms of gauge invariant field
combinations and show that unitarity is preserved in all cases. After fixing a
gauge, the reduced model becomes a massive scalar tensor theory. We show that
the diffeomorphism (Diff) symmetry, instead of TDiff, is a general feature of
the massless sector of consistent massive scalar tensor models. We discuss some
subtleties when eliminating St\""uckelberg fields directly at action level as
gauge conditions. We also show that the reduced models all have a smooth
massless limit.
  A non local connection between the massless sector of the scalar tensor
theory and the pure tensor TDiff model leads to a parametrization of the non
conserved source which naturally separates spin-0 and spin-2 contributions in
the pure tensor theory.
  The case of curved backgrounds is also investigated. If we truncate the non
minimal couplings to linear terms in the curvature, vector and scalar
constraints require Einstein spaces as in the Diff and WTDiff (Weyl plus Diff)
cases. We prove that our linearized massive scalar tensor models admit those
curved background extensions.

between electron count and system volume. On the other hand, conventional
topological insulators, outside of quantum hall effect systems, do not
typically display such a commensuration. Tnstead, they can undergo a phase
transition to a trivial insulator that preserves the electron filling.
Nevertheless, in some crystalline insulators, termed filling-enforced quantum
band insulators (feQBIs), electron filling can dictate nontrivial topology in
the insulating ground state. Currently, little is known about the relation
between feQBIs and conventional topological invariants. In this work, we study
such relations for a particularly interesting example of a half-filling feQBI
that is realized in space group 106 with spinless electrons. We prove that any
4-band feQBI in space group 106 with filling 2 must have a nontrivial
topological invariant, namely the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ glide invariant, and thus must
have a quantized magnetoelectric polarizability $\theta=\pi$. We thus have
found a three-dimensional example where electron filling and band topology are
tied. Such a locking raises intriguing questions about the generality of the
band-inversion paradigm in describing the transition between trivial and
topological phases.

of 2(N-1)/N relative to the best previously known approach. In addition, we
introduce a more communication-efficient approach to parallelizing an
approximate CP-ALS algorithm, pairwise perturbation. This technique uses
perturbative corrections to the subproblems rather than recomputing the
contractions, and asymptotically accelerates ALS. Our benchmark results show
that the per-sweep time achieves 1.25X speed-up for MSDT and 1.94X speed-up for
pairwise perturbation compared to the state-of-art dimension trees running on

Gaussian base distributions and can be seen in the norms of the interpolated

result in better interpolations, but it is not clear how to correct the norm in
an unambiguous way. In this paper, we solve this issue by enforcing a fixed
norm and, hence, change the base distribution, to allow for a principled way of
interpolation. Specifically, we use the Dirichlet and von Mises-Fisher base
distributions. Our experimental results show superior performance in terms of

exchanging money; exchanges are often facilitated by a central clearinghouse,
with the goal of maximizing the aggregate quality (or number) of swaps. Barter
exchanges are subject to many forms of uncertainty--in participant preferences,
the feasibility and quality of various swaps, and so on. Our work is motivated
by kidney exchange, a real-world barter market in which patients in need of a
kidney transplant swap their willing living donors, in order to find a better
match. Modern exchanges include 2- and 3-way swaps, making the kidney exchange
clearing problem NP-hard. Planned transplants often fail for a variety of
reasons--if the donor organ is refused by the recipient's medical team, or if
the donor and recipient are found to be medically incompatible. Due to 2- and
3-way swaps, failed transplants can ""cascade"" through an exchange; one US-based
exchange estimated that about 85% of planned transplants failed in 2019. Many
optimization-based approaches have been designed to avoid these failures;
however most exchanges cannot implement these methods due to legal and policy
constraints. Instead we consider a setting where exchanges can query the
preferences of certain donors and recipients--asking whether they would accept
a particular transplant. We characterize this as a two-stage decision problem,
in which the exchange program (a) queries a small number of transplants before
committing to a matching, and (b) constructs a matching according to fixed
policy. We show that selecting these edges is a challenging combinatorial
problem, which is non-monotonic and non-submodular, in addition to being
NP-hard. We propose both a greedy heuristic and a Monte Carlo tree search,
which outperforms previous approaches, using experiments on both synthetic data

The chirality of a molecule can typically be identified by its characteristic

used to identify the state of molecules or to follow dynamic protein
configurations. In recent years, the focus has moved towards plasmonic
nanostructures, as they show potential for applications ranging from pathogen
sensing to novel optical materials. The plasmonic coupling of the individual
elements of such chiral metallic structures is a crucial prerequisite to obtain
sizeable CD signals. We here identified and implemented various coupling
entities - chiral and achiral - to obtain chiral transfer over distances close
to 100 nm. The coupling is realized by an achiral nanosphere situated between a
pair of gold nanorods that are arranged far apart but in a chiral fashion. We
synthesized these structures with nanometer precision using DNA origami and
obtained sample homogeneity that allowed us to directly demonstrate efficient
chiral energy transfer between the distant nanorods. The transmitter particle
causes a strong enhancement in amplitude of the CD response, the emergence of
an additional chiral feature at the resonance frequency of the nanosphere, and
a redshift of the longitudinal plasmonic resonance frequency of the nanorods.
Numerical simulations closely match our experimental observations and give
insights in the intricate behavior of chiral optical fields and the transfer of

typically easy to control even when the number of interacting components is
large. We provide a theoretical explanation of the scaling by separating
controlling nodes into three types: those that act as inputs, those that
distinguish among attractors, and any remaining nodes. We further identify
characteristics of dynamics that can invalidate this scaling, and speculate
about how this relates more broadly to non-biological systems.

(ALPs), produced in the Sun, with unprecedented sensitivity. BabyIAXO is
conceived to test all IAXO subsystems (magnet, optics and detectors) at a
relevant scale for the final system and thus serve as prototype for IAXO, but
at the same time as a fully-fledged helioscope with relevant physics reach
itself, and with potential for discovery. The BabyIAXO magnet will feature two
10 m long, 70 cm diameter bores, and will host two detection lines (optics and
detector) of dimensions similar to the final ones foreseen for IAXO. BabyIAXO
will detect or reject solar axions or ALPs with axion-photon couplings down to
$g_{a\gamma} \sim 1.5 \times 10^{-11}$ GeV$^{-1}$, and masses up to $m_a\sim
0.25$ eV. BabyIAXO will offer additional opportunities for axion research in
view of IAXO, like the development of precision x-ray detectors to identify
particular spectral features in the solar axion spectrum, and the
implementation of radiofrequency-cavity-based axion dark matter setups.

potential as the fundamental building blocks for next-generation electronics.
However, all the 2D semiconductors that have been experimentally made so far
have room-temperature electron mobility lower than that of bulk silicon, which
is not understood. Here, by using first-principles calculations and
reformulating the transport equations to isolate and quantify contributions of
different mobility-determining factors, we show that the universally low
mobility of 2D semiconductors originates from the high 'density of
scatterings,' which is intrinsic to the 2D material with a parabolic electron
band. The density of scatterings characterizes the density of phonons that can
interact with the electrons and can be fully determined from the electron and
phonon band structures without knowledge of electron-phonon coupling strength.
Our work reveals the underlying physics limiting the electron mobility of 2D
semiconductors and offers a descriptor to quickly assess the mobility.

(AV) systems for decades. As more security vendors turn to machine learning,
alert deluge has hit critical mass with over 20% of all alerts resulting in FPs
and, in some organizations, the number reaches half of all alerts. This
increase has resulted in fatigue, frustration, and, worst of all, neglect from
security workers on SOC teams. A foundational cause for FPs is that vendors
must build one global system to try and satisfy all customers, but have no
method to adjust to individual local environments. This leads to outrageous,
albeit technically correct, characterization of their platforms being 99.9%
effective. Once these systems are deployed the idiosyncrasies of individual,
local environments expose blind spots that lead to FPs and uncertainty.
  We propose a strategy for fixing false positives in production after a model
has already been deployed. For too long the industry has tried to combat these
problems with inefficient, and at times, dangerous allowlist techniques and
excessive model retraining which is no longer enough. We propose using a
technique called passive-aggressive learning to alter a malware detection model
to an individual's environment, eliminating false positives without sharing any
customer sensitive information. We will show how to use passive-aggressive
learning to solve a collection of notoriously difficult false positives from a
production environment without compromising the malware model's accuracy,
reducing the total number of FP alerts by an average of 23x.

compute Shapley values based on the original formula is exponential, and as the

method for estimating Shapley values. Our method is applicable to any machine
learning model, in particular for either multi-class classifications or

demonstrate that our method provides more accurate estimations of the Shapley

demonstrations along with verbal descriptions in order to describe the

then interrelates these two modalities to encode the correlations between

policies can be conditioned at runtime on new human commands and instructions,
which allows for more fine-grained control over the trained policies while also
reducing situational ambiguity. We demonstrate in a set of simulation

implication of privacy-preserving inaccessibility to the source-domain data but
it has rarely been addressed before. Because of limited training data, we
propose a non-parametric approach to this FSL problem by assuming that all the
class prototypes are structurally arranged on a manifold. Accordingly, we
estimate the novel-class prototype locations by projecting the few-shot samples
onto the average of the subspaces on which the surrounding classes lie. During
classification, we again exploit the structural arrangement of the categories
by inducing a Markov chain on the graph constructed with the class prototypes.
This manifold distance obtained using the Markov chain is expected to produce
better results compared to a traditional nearest-neighbor-based Euclidean
distance. To evaluate our proposed framework, we have tested it on two image
datasets - the large-scale ImageNet and the small-scale but fine-grained

has increasingly become a topic of rigorous exploration. While instruments
pertaining to criminal recidivism and academic admissions, for example, have
garnered much attention, the predictive instruments of Child Welfare
jurisdictions have received considerably less attention. This is in part
because comparatively few such instruments exist and because even fewer have
been scrutinized through the lens of algorithmic fairness. In this work, we
seek to address both of these gaps. To this end, a novel classification
algorithm for predicting reunification success within Oregon Child Welfare is
presented, including all of the relevant details associated with building such
an instrument. The purpose of this tool is to maximize the number of stable
reunifications and identify potentially unstable reunifications which may
require additional resources and scrutiny. Additionally, because the
algorithmic fairness of the resulting tool, if left unaltered, is
unquestionably lacking, the utilized procedure for mitigating such unfairness
is presented, along with the rationale behind each difficult and unavoidable
choice. This procedure, though similar to other post-processing group-specific
thresholding methods, is novel in its use of a penalized optimizer and
contextually requisite subsampling. These novel methodological components yield
a rich and informative empirical understanding of the trade-off continuum
between fairness and accuracy. As the developed procedure is generalizable
across a variety of group-level definitions of algorithmic fairness, as well as
across an arbitrary number of protected attribute levels and risk thresholds,
the approach is broadly applicable both within and beyond Child Welfare.

Such lensing
phenomena can magnify the waves, create multiple images observable as repeated

discernible patterns on the waves. In particular, when the lens is small,
$\lesssim 10^5 M_\odot$, it can produce lensed images with time delays shorter
than the typical gravitational-wave signal length that conspire together to
form ``beating patterns''. We present a proof-of-principle study utilizing deep
learning for identification of such a lensing signature. We bring the
excellence of state-of-the-art deep learning models at recognizing foreground
objects from background noises to identifying lensed GWs from noise present
spectrograms. We assume the lens mass is around $10^3 M_\odot$ -- $10^5
M_\odot$, which can produce the order of millisecond time delays between two
images of lensed GWs. We discuss the feasibility of distinguishing lensed GWs
from unlensed ones and estimating physical and lensing parameters. Suggested
method may be of interest to the study of more complicated lensing

investigated. In analogy to the classical Kiefer--Weiss problem, the objective
is to minimize the maximum expected sample size of a sequential test. However,
instead of taking the maximum over a parametric family of distributions, it is
taken over all distributions defined on the given sample space. Two optimality
conditions are stated, one necessary and one sufficient. The latter is based on
existing results on a more general minimax problem in sequential detection.
These results are specialized and made explicit in this paper. It is shown that
the nonparametric Kiefer--Weiss test is distinctly different from its
parametric counterpart and admits non-standard, arguably counterintuitive
properties. In particular, it can be nontruncated and critically depends on its
stopping rules being randomized. These properties are illustrated numerically
using the example of coin flipping, that is, testing the success probability of
a Bernoulli random variable.

used on smart speakers and on-device applications. Since these models are
expected to transcribe speech with minimal latency, they are constrained to be
causal with no future context, compared to their non-streaming counterparts.
Consequently, streaming models usually perform worse than non-streaming models.
We propose a novel and effective learning method by leveraging a non-streaming
ASR model as a teacher to generate transcripts on an arbitrarily large data
set, which is then used to distill knowledge into streaming ASR models. This
way, we scale the training of streaming models to up to 3 million hours of
YouTube audio. Experiments show that our approach can significantly reduce the
word error rate (WER) of RNNT models not only on LibriSpeech but also on
YouTube data in four languages. For example, in French, we are able to reduce
the WER by 16.4% relatively to a baseline streaming model by leveraging a
non-streaming teacher model trained on the same amount of labeled data as the
baseline.

  Fields","63 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math-ph cond-mat.mes-hall math.AP math.MP quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Topological insulators (TIs) are a class of materials which are insulating in
their bulk form yet, upon introduction of an a boundary or edge, e.g. by
abruptly terminating the material, may exhibit spontaneous current along their
boundary. This property is quantified by topological indices associated with
either the bulk or the edge system. In the field of condensed matter physics,
tight binding (discrete) approximate models, parametrized by hopping
coefficients, have been used successfully to capture the topological behavior
of TIs in many settings. However, whether such tight binding models capture the
same topological features as the underlying continuum models of quantum physics
has been an open question.
  We resolve this question in the context of the archetypal example of
topological behavior in materials, the integer quantum Hall effect. We study a
class of continuum Hamiltonians, $H^\lambda$, which govern electron motion in a
two-dimensional crystal under the influence of a perpendicular magnetic field.
No assumption is made on translation invariance of the crystal. We prove, in
the regime where both the magnetic field strength and depth of the crystal
potential are sufficiently large, $\lambda\gg1$, that the low-lying energy
spectrum and eigenstates (and corresponding large time dynamics) of $H^\lambda$
are well-described by a scale-free discrete Hamiltonian, $H^{\rm TB}$; we show
norm resolvent convergence. The relevant topological index is the Hall
conductivity, which is expressible as a Fredholm index. We prove that for large
$\lambda$ the topological indices of $H^\lambda$ and $H^{\rm TB}$ agree. This
is proved separately for bulk and edge geometries. Our results justify the
principle of using discrete models in the study of topological matter.

fabrication procedures featuring poor reproducibility. Planar resonant antennas
fabricated via photolithography have been recently investigated, also because
of their superior field enhancement properties. Nevertheless, the electron
emission from these structures is parallel to the substrate plane, which limits
their practical use as electron sources. In this work, we present an innovative
out-of-plane, resonant nanoantenna design for field-driven photoemission
enabled by high-resolution 3D printing. Numerical and experimental evidences
demonstrate that gold-coated, terahertz resonant nanocones provide large local
electric fields at their apex, automatically ensuring out-of-plane coherent
electron emission and acceleration. We show that the resonant structures can be
conveniently arranged in an array form, for a further significant electron
extraction enhancement via a collective terahertz response. Remarkably, such
collective behaviour can also be harvested to boost photoemission from an
individual nano-source. Our approach opens the path for a new generation of
photocathodes that can be reproducibly fabricated and designed at will,
significantly relaxing the requirement for intense terahertz drivers.

both fragmentation and magnetic field properties are studied in a uniform way.
We measured the fragmentation level, Nmm, within the field of view common to
all regions, of 0.15 pc, with a mass sensitivity of about 0.5 Msun, and a
spatial resolution of about 1000 au. In order to obtain the magnetic field
strength using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, we estimated the
dispersion of the polarization position angles, the velocity dispersion of the
H13CO+(4-3) gas, and the density of each core, all averaged within 0.15 pc. A
strong correlation is found between Nmm and the average density of the parental
core, although with significant scatter. When large-scale systematic motions
are separated from the velocity dispersion and only the small-scale (turbulent)
contribution is taken into account, a tentative correlation is found between
Nmm and the mass-to-flux ratio, as suggested by numerical and theoretical

As a result, the algorithm simultaneously achieves order-optimal convergence

$\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ iterations in non-smooth ones. Importantly,
these guarantees do not require any of the standard boundedness or Lipschitz

languages presented during training. However, the representations it learned
were not successful in zero-shot transfer to unseen languages. Because that

insight into the factors limiting zero-shot ASR transfer, we replace the

Then, we perform an extensive evaluation of monolingual, multilingual, and

crosslingual phonotactics is limited, and imposing a too strong model can hurt

popular practice, driving innovation in ever-expanding fields. This has opened
the door to new attacks that can have serious privacy implications. One such
attack, the Membership Inference Attack (MIA), exposes whether or not a
particular data point was used to train a model. A growing body of literature
uses Differentially Private (DP) training algorithms as a defence against such
attacks. However, these works evaluate the defence under the restrictive
assumption that all members of the training set, as well as non-members, are

real-world use cases in the literature. Motivated by this, we evaluate
membership inference with statistical dependencies among samples and explain
why DP does not provide meaningful protection (the privacy parameter $\epsilon$

series of empirical evaluations with off-the-shelf MIAs using training sets

intersecting families of subsets, extremal problems regarding intersecting
properties of families of various combinatorial objects have been extensively
investigated. Among them, studies about families of subsets, vector spaces and
permutations are of particular concerns.
  Recently, the authors proposed a new quantitative intersection problem for
families of subsets: For $\mathcal{F}\subseteq {[n]\choose k}$, define its
\emph{total intersection number} as $\mathcal{I}(\mathcal{F})=\sum_{F_1,F_2\in
\mathcal{F}}|F_1\cap F_2|$. Then, what is the structure of $\mathcal{F}$ when
it has the maximal total intersection number among all families in ${[n]\choose

problem and characterized extremal structures of families maximizing the total
intersection number of given sizes.
  In this paper, we consider the analogues of this problem for families of
vector spaces and permutations. For certain ranges of family size, we provide
structural characterizations for both families of subspaces and families of
permutations having maximal total intersection numbers. To some extent, these
results determine the unique structure of the optimal family for some certain
values of $|\mathcal{F}|$ and characterize the relation between having maximal
total intersection number and being intersecting. Besides, we also show several
upper bounds on the total intersection numbers for both families of subspaces
and families of permutations of given sizes.

which has profound significance in research on asteroids and can provide a
total geometric perspective to understanding the evolution of the dynamic
characteristics from a global perspective. Based on the polyhedron model,
convergence is derived via a series of theoretical analyses and derivations,
which shows that a periodic orbit will evolve into a nearly circular orbit with
a normal periodic ratio (e.g., 2:1, 3:2, and 4:3) and almost zero torsion under
proper circumstances. As an application of the results developed here, three
asteroids, (216) Kleopatra, (22) Kalliope and (433) Eros, are studied, and
several representative periodic orbit families are detected, with convergence
in three different cases: bidirectional, increasing-directional and
decreasing-directional continuation. At the same time, four commonalities among
these numerical examples are concluded. First, a (pseudo) tangent bifurcation
arises at the cuspidal points during the variations in the periodic ratios in a
single periodic orbit family. In addition, these cuspidal points in the
periodic ratio coincide with the turning points during the variations in the
average radius, the maximal torsion and the maximal radius of curvature.
Furthermore, the periodic ratio increases (or decreases) with an increase (or
decrease) in the Jacobian constant overall. We find the relationship between
periodic ratio and Jacobian constant. The results implies that the periodic
ratios for a fixed resonant status have an infimum and a supremum. Finally, if
the periodic orbit converges to a point, it can be an unstable equilibrium
point of the asteroid.

  Adversarial Discriminative Domain Regularization","8 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Matching information across image and text modalities is a fundamental
challenge for many applications that involve both vision and natural language
processing. The objective is to find efficient similarity metrics to compare
the similarity between visual and textual information. Existing approaches
mainly match the local visual objects and the sentence words in a shared space
with attention mechanisms. The matching performance is still limited because
the similarity computation is based on simple comparisons of the matching
features, ignoring the characteristics of their distribution in the data. In
this paper, we address this limitation with an efficient learning objective
that considers the discriminative feature distributions between the visual
objects and sentence words. Specifically, we propose a novel Adversarial
Discriminative Domain Regularization (ADDR) learning framework, beyond the
paradigm metric learning objective, to construct a set of discriminative data
domains within each image-text pairs. Our approach can generally improve the
learning efficiency and the performance of existing metrics learning frameworks
by regulating the distribution of the hidden space between the matching pairs.
The experimental results show that this new approach significantly improves the
overall performance of several popular cross-modal matching techniques (SCAN,
VSRN, BFAN) on the MS-COCO and Flickr30K benchmarks.

are distinct from those in their pre-/postsynaptic layers, but how this affects
network-level information processing remains unexplored. Here we show that
layer-to-layer heterogeneity arising from lamina-specific cellular properties
facilitates signal and information transmission in FFNs. Specifically, we found
that signal transformations, made by each layer of neurons on an input-driven
spike signal, demodulate signal distortions introduced by preceding layers.
This mechanism boosts information transfer carried by a propagating spike
signal and thereby supports reliable spike signal and information transmission
in a deep FFN. Our study suggests that distinct cell types in neural circuits,
performing different computational functions, facilitate information processing

  for Multistage Stochastic Linear Programming",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multistage stochastic programming deals with operational and planning
problems that involve a sequence of decisions over time while responding to
realizations that are uncertain. Algorithms designed to address multistage
stochastic linear programming (MSLP) problems often rely upon scenario trees to
represent the underlying stochastic process. When this process exhibits
stagewise independence, sampling-based techniques, particularly the stochastic
dual dynamic programming (SDDP) algorithm, have received wide acceptance.
However, these sampling-based methods still operate with a deterministic
representation of the problem that uses the so-called sample average
approximation. In this work, we present a sequential sampling approach for MSLP
problems that allows the decision process to assimilate newly sampled data
recursively. We refer to this method as the stochastic dynamic linear
programming (SDLP) algorithm. Since we use sequential sampling, the algorithm
does not necessitate a priori representation of uncertainty, either through a
scenario tree or sample average approximation, both of which require a
knowledge/estimation of the underlying distribution. In this regard, SDLP is a
sequential sampling approach to address MSLP problems. This method constitutes
a generalization of the Stochastic Decomposition (SD) for two-stage SLP models.
We employ quadratic regularization for optimization problems in the
non-terminal stages. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of basic feasible
policies which provide a piecewise-affine solution discovery scheme, that is
embedded within the optimization algorithm to identify incumbent solutions used
for regularization. Finally, we show that the SDLP algorithm provides a
sequence of decisions and corresponding value function estimates along a
sequence of state trajectories that asymptotically converge to their optimal
counterparts, with probability one.

Over-the-air computation, as a new diagram of sensor networks, integrates data
collection and processing in one slot: all nodes transmit their signals
simultaneously in the analog wave and the processing is done in the air. This
method, although efficient, requires that signals from all nodes arrive at the
sink, aligned in signal magnitude so as to enable an unbiased estimation. For
nodes far away from the sink with a low channel gain, misalignment in signal
magnitude is unavoidable. To solve this problem, in this paper, we investigate
the amplify-and-forward based relay, in which a relay node amplifies signals

a simple relay policy. Then, a coherent relay policy is proposed to reduce
relay transmission power. Directly minimizing the computation error tends to
over-increase node transmission power. Therefore, the two relay policies are

surgeries to total joint replacements represent a substantial financial burden
to the health care system. Fixation failures, such as implant loosening, wear,
and mechanical instability of the poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) cement,
which bonds the implant to the bone, are the main causes of long-term implant
failure. Early and accurate diagnosis of cement failure is critical for
developing novel therapeutic strategies and reducing the high risk of a
misjudged revision. Unfortunately, prevailing imaging modalities, notably plain
radiographs, struggle to detect the precursors of implant failure and are often
interpreted incorrectly. Our prior work has shown that the modification of PMMA
bone cement with low concentrations of conductive fillers makes it
piezoresistive and therefore self-sensing such that when combined with a
conductivity imaging modality, such as electrical impedance tomography (EIT),
it is possible to monitor load transfer across the PMMA using cost-effective,
physiologically benign, and real-time electrical measurements. Herein, we
expand upon these results by integrating machine learning techniques with EIT.
We survey different machine learning algorithms and principal component
analysis for application to this problem, including neural networks on voltage
readings of an EIT phantom for tracking position of a sample, specifying defect
location, and classifying defect types. Our results show advantage of neural
network with more than 91.9 %, 95.5 %, and 98 % accuracy in interpreting EIT
signals for location tracking, specifying defect location, and defect
classification respectively. These preliminary results show that the
combination of smart materials, EIT, and machine learning may be a powerful
tool for diagnosing the origin and evolution of failure in joint replacement.

ERNIE-Gram, n-grams are masked and predicted directly using explicit n-gram
identities rather than contiguous sequences of n tokens. Furthermore,
ERNIE-Gram employs a generator model to sample plausible n-gram identities as
optional n-gram masks and predict them in both coarse-grained and fine-grained
manners to enable comprehensive n-gram prediction and relation modeling. We
pre-train ERNIE-Gram on English and Chinese text corpora and fine-tune on 19

phenomenological damping arising from coupling to modes extrinsic to the

example, we calculate the current-induced orbital magnetization in SnP, and
find that it might be sufficiently large for measurement. Next, we consider a
two-dimensional system without inversion symmetry. We establish a method to
calculate the current-induced orbital magnetization in the in-plane direction
by using real-space coordinates in the thickness direction. By applying this
theory to surfaces and interfaces of insulators, we find that an electric

particles, pulsars and pulsar wind nebulae are believed to be a more natural
astrophysical origin: electrons injected from nearby pulsars at their early
ages can form a bump-like feature in the spectrum due to radiative energy
losses. In this paper, with a survey of nearby pulsars, we find 4 pulsars that
may have notable contributions to $\sim$ 1.4 TeV cosmic ray electrons. Among
them, PSR J0855$-$4644 has a spin down luminosity more than 50 times higher
than others and presumably dominates the electron fluxes from them. X-ray
observations on the inner compact part (which may represent a tunnel for the
transport of electrons from the pulsar) of PWN G267.0$-$01.0 are then used to
constrain the spectral index of high energy electrons injected by the pulsar.

reproduce the 1.4 TeV spectral feature hinted by the DAMPE with reasonable

adaptive Lasso (Alasso) which show reasonable ability with a wide range of
sparsity constant in our preliminary tests, to a two-dimensional single
cylinder wake at $Re_D=100$, its transient process, and a wake of two-parallel
cylinders, as examples of high-dimensional fluid data. To handle these high
dimensional data with SINDy whose library matrix is suitable for
low-dimensional variable combinations, a convolutional neural network-based
autoencoder (CNN-AE) is utilized. The CNN-AE is employed to map a
high-dimensional dynamics into a low-dimensional latent space. The SINDy then
seeks a governing equation of the mapped low-dimensional latent vector.
Temporal evolution of high-dimensional dynamics can be provided by combining
the predicted latent vector by SINDy with the CNN decoder which can remap the
low-dimensional latent vector to the original dimension. The SINDy can provide
a stable solution as the governing equation of the latent dynamics and the
CNN-SINDy based modeling can reproduce high-dimensional flow fields
successfully, although more terms are required to represent the transient flow

turbulent shear flow model is finally considered to examine the applicability
of SINDy to turbulence, although without using CNN-AE. The present results
suggest that the proposed scheme with an appropriate parameter choice enables

not necessarily need such a heavy structure for all time frames especially when
the cross-talker challenge happens only occasionally. For example, in
conversation scenarios, most regions contain only a single active speaker,
where the separation task downgrades to a single speaker enhancement problem.
It turns out that using a very deep network structure for dealing with signals
with a low overlap ratio not only negatively affects the inference efficiency
but also hurts the separation performance. To deal with this problem, we
propose an early exit mechanism, which enables the Transformer model to handle
different cases with adaptive depth. Experimental results indicate that not

  Autoencoders with Knowledge Distillation",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Automatically generating financial report from a piece of news is quite a
challenging task. Apparently, the difficulty of this task lies in the lack of
sufficient background knowledge to effectively generate long financial report.
To address this issue, this paper proposes the conditional variational
autoencoders (CVAE) based approach which distills external knowledge from a
corpus of news-report data. Particularly, we choose Bi-GRU as the encoder and
decoder component of CVAE, and learn the latent variable distribution from
input news. A higher level latent variable distribution is learnt from a corpus
set of news-report data, respectively extr acted for each input news, to
provide background knowledge to previously learnt latent variable distribution.
Then, a teacher-student network is employed to distill knowledge to refine
theoutput of the decoder component. To evaluate the model performance of the
proposed approach, extensive experiments are preformed on a public dataset and
two widely adopted evaluation criteria, i.e., BLEU and ROUGE, are chosen in the
experiment. The promising experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
approach is superior to the rest compared methods.

focuses on enriching the training data by involving perturbed data. Despite of
the efficiency in defending specific attacks, adversarial training is benefited
from the data augmentation, which does not contribute to the robustness of DNN

propose a novel defense that aims at augmenting the model in order to learn

Specifically, we introduce multiple paths to augment the network, and impose
orthogonality constraints on these paths. In addition, a margin-maximization
loss is designed to further boost DIversity via Orthogonality (DIO). Extensive
empirical results on various data sets, architectures, and attacks demonstrate
the adversarial robustness of the proposed DIO.

examine the performance on a set of small organic molecules. We achieve a high
level of accuracy when fitting individual molecules, comparable to those of the

Protoplanetary disks display a large variety of structures in recently

morphology of these disks is often difficult to infer from the two-dimensional
projected images we observe. We spatially resolve the disk around HD 34282
using VLT/SPHERE in polarimetric imaging mode. We retrieve a profile for the
height of the scattering surface to create a height-corrected deprojection,
which simulates a face-on orientation. The disk displays a complex scattering
surface. An inner clearing or cavity extending up to r<0.28"" (88 au) is
surrounded by a bright inclined (i = 56 deg) ring with a position angle of 119
deg. The center of this ring is offset from the star along the minor axis with
0.07"", which can be explained with a disk-height of 26 au above the mid-plane.
Outside this ring, beyond its south-eastern ansa we detect an azimuthal
asymmetry or blob at r ~ 0.4"". At larger separation, we detect an outer disk
structure that can be fitted with an ellipse, compatible with a circular ring
seen at r = 0.62"" (190 au) and height of 77 au. After applying a
height-corrected deprojection we see a circular ring centered on the star at 88
au, while what seemed to be a separate blob and outer ring, now both could be
part of a single-armed spiral. Based on the current data it is not possible to
conclude decisively whether $H_{\rm scat} / r$ remains constant or whether the
surface is flared with at most $H_{\rm scat} \propto r^{1.35}$ , although we
favor the constant ratio based on our deprojections. The height-corrected
deprojection allows a more detailed interpretation of the observed structures,

optimisation problem. Deep learning has been successfully extended to
meta-learning, where previous solving efforts assist in learning how to

approaches have shown success in solving TSP problems. However, they focus on
one type of TSP problem, namely ones where the points are uniformly distributed
in Euclidean spaces and have issues in generalising to other embedding spaces,
e.g., spherical distance spaces, and to TSP instances where the points are
distributed in a non-uniform manner. An aim of learning to optimise is to train
once and solve across a broad spectrum of (TSP) problems. Although supervised
learning approaches have shown to achieve more optimal solutions than
unsupervised approaches, they do require the generation of training data and
running a solver to obtain solutions to learn from, which can be time-consuming
and difficult to find reasonable solutions for harder TSP instances. Hence this
paper introduces a new learning-based approach to solve a variety of different

to train and are easier to obtain better solutions. We name this approach the
non-Euclidean TSP network (NETSP-Net). The approach is evaluated on various TSP

approach generalises across many types of instances and scales to instances
that are larger than what was used during training.

its inner lesions in most cases, we propose a hierarchical organ-to-lesion

student segmentor is trained with combinations of manual-labeled and
pseudo-labeled annotations. We further proposed a localization branch realized
via an aggregation of high-level features in a deep decoder to predict

Poincar\'{e} surface of section, the Lyapunov exponent and the statistics of
eigenmodes and eigenfrequency spectrum in the transformed inhomogeneous table
billiard, we find that the degree of chaos is fully controlled by a single
geometric parameter of the curved surface. A simple interpretation of our
findings in transformed billiards, the ""fictitious force"", allows to extend our
prediction to other class of curved surfaces. This powerful analogy between two
a prior unrelated systems not only brings forward a novel approach to control
the degree of chaos, but also provides potentialities for further studies and
applications in various fields, such as billiards design, optical fibers, or

knowledge of measurable network characteristics, find a topology with the

Internet networks with 10 Gbps access links for silos, our algorithms speed up
training by a factor 9 and 1.5 in comparison to the master-slave architecture

train and test label distributions do not match. Existing work addressing label
shift usually assumes access to an \emph{unlabelled} test sample. This sample
may be used to estimate the test label distribution, and to then train a
suitably re-weighted classifier. While approaches using this idea have proven
effective, their scope is limited as it is not always feasible to access the
target domain; further, they require repeated retraining if the model is to be
deployed in \emph{multiple} test environments. Can one instead learn a
\emph{single} classifier that is robust to arbitrary label shifts from a broad
family? In this paper, we answer this question by proposing a model that
minimises an objective based on distributionally robust optimisation (DRO). We
then design and analyse a gradient descent-proximal mirror ascent algorithm
tailored for large-scale problems to optimise the proposed objective. %, and
establish its convergence. Finally, through experiments on CIFAR-100 and

a number of baselines in settings where label shift is present.

of a given 2D image from a large 3D shape database. The common routine is to
map 2D images and 3D shapes into an embedding space and define (or learn) a
shape similarity measure. While metric learning with some adaptation techniques
seems to be a natural solution to shape similarity learning, the performance is
often unsatisfactory for fine-grained shape retrieval. In the paper, we

away negative pairs. To tackle this issue, we develop a geometry-focused

the adverse effects of rich texture in 2D images, thereby push the network to

high time resolution density data obtained by calibrating spacecraft potential
allow an investigation of the turbulent density fluctuations in the solar wind
and their three-dimensional structure in the sub-ion range. The wave-vector
associated with the highest energy density at each spacecraft frequency is
obtained by application of the Multi-point signal resonator technique to the
four-point density data. The fluctuations show a strong wave-vector anisotropy
$k_{\perp}\gg k_{\parallel}$ where the parallel and perpendicular symbols are
with respect to the mean magnetic field direction. The plasma frame frequencies
show two populations, one below the proton cyclotron frequency
$\omega<\Omega_{ci}$ consistent with kinetic Alfv\'en wave (KAW) turbulence.
The second component has higher frequencies $\omega > \Omega_{ci}$ consistent
with ion Bernstein wave (IBW) turbulence. Alternatively, these fluctuations may
constitute KAWs that have undergone multiple wave-wave interactions causing a
broadening in the plasma frame frequencies. The scale-dependent kurtosis in
this wave-vector region shows a reduction in intermittency at the small scales
which can also be explained by the presence of wave activity. Our results
suggest that small-scale turbulence exhibits linear-wave properties of kinetic
Alfv\'en and possibly ion-Bernstein/magnetosonic waves. Based on our results,
we speculate that these waves may play a role in describing the observed
reduction in intermittency at sub ion scales.

where context distribution and exploration policy are decoupled, and we obtain
an algorithm robust to unbalanced context distributions. Then, using an
incremental primal-dual approach to solve the Lagrangian relaxation of the

Finally, we remove forced exploration and build on confidence intervals of the
optimization problem to encourage a minimum level of exploration that is better
adapted to the problem structure. We demonstrate the asymptotic optimality of
our algorithm, while providing both problem-dependent and worst-case
finite-time regret guarantees. Our bounds scale with the logarithm of the
number of arms, thus avoiding the linear dependence common in all related prior

works of GNN for recommendation systems do not consider the relational

lattices, including metasurfaces and photonic crystal slabs, have been studied
extensively in recent years. Typically, the BICs and Fano resonances are
associated with the second stop bands open at the second-order Gamma ($\Gamma$)
point. This paper address the fundamental properties of the fourth stop band
accompanied by BICs at the third-order $\Gamma$ point in one-dimensional (1D)
leaky-mode photonic lattices. At the fourth stop band, one band edge mode
suffers radiation loss, thereby generating a Fano resonance, while the other
band edge mode becomes a nonleaky BIC. The fourth stop band is controlled
primarily by the Bragg processes associated with the first, second, and fourth
Fourier harmonic components of the periodic dielectric constant modulation. The
interplay between these three major processes closes the fourth band gap and
induces a band flip whereby the leaky and BIC edges transit across the fourth
band gap. At the fourth stop band, a new type of BIC is formed owing to the
destructive interplay between the first and second Fourier harmonics. When the
fourth band gap closes with strongly enhanced $Q$ factors, Dirac cone
dispersions can appear at the third-order $\Gamma$ point. Our results
demonstrate a method for manipulating electromagnetic waves by utilizing the

threat, dictionary attacks must be thoughtfully configured and tuned. However,
this process requires a domain-knowledge and expertise that cannot be easily
replicated. The consequence of inaccurately calibrating dictionary attacks is
the unreliability of password security analyses, impaired by a severe
measurement bias.
  In the present work, we introduce a new generation of dictionary attacks that
is consistently more resilient to inadequate configurations. Requiring no
supervision or domain-knowledge, this technique automatically approximates the
advanced guessing strategies adopted by real-world attackers. To achieve this:
(1) We use deep neural networks to model the proficiency of adversaries in
building attack configurations. (2) Then, we introduce dynamic guessing
strategies within dictionary attacks. These mimic experts' ability to adapt
their guessing strategies on the fly by incorporating knowledge on their
targets.
  Our techniques enable more robust and sound password strength estimates
within dictionary attacks, eventually reducing overestimation in modeling
real-world threats in password security. Code available:

the other hand, infrastructure-based methods can generally overcome these
issues, but at the expense of some installation cost. This poses an interesting
problem of how to effectively combine these methods, so as to achieve
localization with long-term consistency as well as flexibility compared to any
single method. To this end, we propose a comprehensive optimization-based
estimator for 15-dimensional state of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), fusing
data from an extensive set of sensors: inertial measurement units (IMUs),
Ultra-Wideband (UWB) ranging sensors, and multiple onboard Visual-Inertial and
Lidar odometry subsystems. In essence, a sliding window is used to formulate a
sequence of robot poses, where relative rotational and translational
constraints between these poses are observed in the IMU preintegration and OSL
observations, while orientation and position are coupled in body-offset UWB
range observations. An optimization-based approach is developed to estimate the
trajectory of the robot in this sliding window. We evaluate the performance of
the proposed scheme in multiple scenarios, including experiments on public
datasets, high-fidelity graphical-physical simulator, and field-collected data
from UAV flight tests. The result demonstrates that our integrated localization
method can effectively resolve the drift issue, while incurring minimal

laboratory experiments of a reactive (i.e. melting) solid sphere freely falling
by gravity in a stratified environment, in the regime of large Reynolds ($Re$)
and Froude numbers. We compare our results to non-reactive spheres in the same
regime. First, we confirm for larger values of $Re$, the stratification drag
enhancement previously observed for low and moderate Re (Magnaudet and Mercier,
2020). We also show an even more significant drag enhancement due to melting,
much larger than the stratification-induced one. We argue that the mechanism
for both enhancements is similar, due to the specific structure of the
vorticity field sets by buoyancy effects and associated baroclinic torques, as
deciphered for stratification by Zhang et al. (2019). Using particle image
velocimetry, we then characterize the long-term evolution (at time $t \gg 1/N$
with $N$ the Br\""unt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency) of the internal wave field
generated by the wake of the spheres. Measured wave field is similar for both
reactive and inert spheres: indeed, each sphere fall might be considered as a
quasi impulsive source of energy in time and the horizontal direction, as the
falling time (resp. the sphere radius) is much smaller than $N$ (resp. than the
tank width). Internal gravity waves are generated by wake turbulence over a
broad spectrum, with the least damped component being at the
Br\""unt-V\""ais\""al\""a frequency and the largest admissible horizontal

converted in to kinetic energy in the internal waves, with no significant

in which mutually-distrusted parties can work together. Recently, oracle
services emerged to provide these applications with real-world data feeds.
Unfortunately, these capabilities have been used for malicious purposes under
what is called criminal smart contracts. A few works explored this dark side
and showed a variety of such attacks. However, none of them considered
collaborative attacks against targets that reside outside the blockchain
ecosystem. In this paper, we bridge this gap and introduce a smart
contract-based framework that allows a sponsor to orchestrate a collaborative
attack among (pseudo)anonymous attackers and reward them for that. While all
previous works required a technique to quantify an attacker's individual
contribution, which could be infeasible with respect to real-world targets, our
framework avoids that. This is done by developing a novel scheme for trustless
collaboration through betting. That is, attackers bet on an event (i.e., the
attack takes place) and then work on making that event happen (i.e., perform
the attack). By taking DDoS as a usecase, we formulate attackers' interaction
as a game, and formally prove that these attackers will collaborate in
proportion to the amount of their bets in the game's unique equilibrium. We
also model our framework and its reward function as an incentive mechanism and
prove that it is a strategy proof and budget-balanced one. Finally, we conduct
numerical simulations to demonstrate the equilibrium behavior of our framework.

diffusion of information as a result of repeated local exchanges of

situations where agents may be hesitant to share raw data due to privacy
concerns. Nevertheless, in the absence of additional privacy-preserving
mechanisms, the exchange of local estimates, which are generated based on
private data can allow for the inference of the data itself. The most common
mechanism for guaranteeing privacy is the addition of perturbations to local
estimates before broadcasting. These perturbations are generally chosen
independently at every agent, resulting in a significant performance loss. We
propose an alternative scheme, which constructs perturbations according to a
particular nullspace condition, allowing them to be invisible (to first order

dispersion. They match extremely well with the two-spinon continuum following
the comparison with Mueller Ansatz calculations. The localized $dd$ excitations
and the observation of the strongly dispersive magnetic excitations suggest
that orbiton dispersion is below the resolution detection limit. Our results
can reconcile with the strong {\it local} Jahn-Teller effect in KCuF$_3$, which
predominantly drives orbital ordering.

meaningful patterns with the goal of driving group instructions based on
students' characteristics. However, these methods ignore the individual
characteristics of students as they only focus on common characteristics of
students. In this article, we propose a framework to detect both group
characteristics and individual characteristics of students simultaneously. We
assume that the characteristics matrix of students' is composed of two parts:
one is a low-rank matrix representing the common characteristics of students;
the other is a sparse matrix representing individual characteristics of
students. Thus, we treat the balancing issue as a matrix recovering problem.
The experiment results show the effectiveness of our method. Firstly, it can
detect meaningful biclusters that are comparable with the state-of-the-art
biclutering algorithms. Secondly, it can identify individual characteristics
for each student simultaneously. Both the source code of our algorithm and the

(EFT), which provides a systematic model independent framework for assessing
the feasibility of light particle-stable three-body bound states, utilizing
low-energy universality. Here we take recourse to a simplistic speculation of
the three-body system by eliminating the repulsive spin-singlet $\Xi^- n$
sub-system, while retaining the predominantly attractive (possibly bound)
spin-triplet $\Xi^{-}n$ and the virtual bound spin-singlet $nn$ sub-system. In
particular, a qualitative leading order EFT investigation by introducing a
sharp momentum (ultraviolet) cut-off parameter $\Lambda_c$ into the
Faddeev-like coupled integral equations, indicates a discrete scaling behavior
akin to a renormalization group limit cycle, thereby suggesting the formal
existence of Efimov states in the unitary limit, as $\Lambda_c\to \infty$. Our
subsequent non-asymptotic analysis indicates that the three-body binding energy
$B_3$ is sensitively dependent on the cut-off without the inclusion of
three-body contact interactions. Furthermore, our analysis reproduces several
values of the binding energy $B_3\sim 3-4$ MeV, predicted in context of
existing potential models, with the regulator $\Lambda_c$ in the range, $\sim
350-460$ MeV. Finally, based on these model inputs for $B_3$, a ballpark
estimate of the three-body scattering length in the range, $2.6-4.9$ fm, is
naively constrained by our EFT analysis, ostensibly demonstrating the universal
nature of three-body correlations that is likely to manifest themselves in a
halo-bound $\Xi^{-}nn$ system.

one stellar component of a binary star, most of which have very diverse
eccentricity. These discoveries raise the question of their formation and
long-term evolution because the stellar companion can strongly affect the
planet formation process. We aim to study the dynamical influence of a wide
binary companion on the evolution of a single giant planet migrating in a
protoplanetary disk. Methods. Using a symplectic n-body integrator adapted for
binary star systems and modeling the dissipation due to the disk by appropriate
formulae emerging from hydrodynamical simulations, we carried out 3600
simulations with different orbital parameters for the planet and different
eccentricity and inclination values for the binary companion. The long-term
evolution of the planets was followed for 100 Myr and the different dynamical
behaviors were unveiled using a quadrupolar Hamiltonian approach. Results. We
highlight the high probability for planets to experience, during the disk
phase, a scattering event or an ejection due to the presence of a binary
companion. We show that a capture in a Lidov-Kozai resonant state is far from
automatic when the binary companion star is highly inclined, since only $11 \%$
of the systems end up locked in the resonance at the end of the simulations.
Nevertheless, in the presence of a highly inclined binary companion, all the
planetary evolutions are strongly influenced by the Lidov-Kozai resonance and
the nonresonant evolutions present high eccentricity and inclination variations
associated with circulation around the Lidov-Kozai islands.

relays to cache sensing data generated by IoT sensors as well as provide
communication services for data consumers. However, a critical issue of IoT
sensing is that data are usually transient, which necessitates temporal updates
of caching content items while frequent cache updates could lead to
considerable energy cost and challenge the lifetime of IoT sensors. To address
this issue, we adopt the Age of Information (AoI) to quantify data freshness
and propose an online cache update scheme to obtain an effective tradeoff
between the average AoI and energy cost. Specifically, we first develop a
characterization of transmission energy consumption at IoT sensors by
incorporating a successful transmission condition. Then, we model cache
updating as a Markov decision process to minimize average weighted cost with
judicious definitions of state, action, and reward. Since user preference
towards content items is usually unknown and often temporally evolving, we
therefore develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to enable
intelligent cache updates. Through trial-and-error explorations, an effective
caching policy can be learned without requiring exact knowledge of content
popularity. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed
framework.

transition, in a prototypical q-state vector Potts model which is driven out of
equilibrium by coupling the spins to heat baths at two different temperatures.
We discuss the behavior of the quantities that are typically considered in the
vicinity of (equilibrium) phase transitions, like the specific heat, and
moreover investigate the behavior of the entropy production (EP), which
directly quantifies the irreversibility of the process. For the second-order
phase transition, we show that the universality class remains the same as in
equilibrium. Further, the derivative of the EP rate with respect to the
temperature diverges with a power-law at the critical point, but displays a
non-universal critical exponent, which depends on the temperature difference,
i.e., the strength of the driving. For the infinite-order transition, the
derivative of the EP exhibits a maximum in the disordered phase, similar to the
specific heat. However, in contrast to the specific heat, whose maximum is
independent of the strength of the driving, the maximum of the derivative of
the EP grows with increasing temperature difference. We also consider entropy
fluctuations and find that their skewness increases with the driving strength,

material into water governs the wave generation process. We observe that the
amplitude of the wave relative to the water height scales linearly with the
Froude number based on the horizontal velocity of the moving granular front
relative to the wave velocity. For all the different parameters considered
here, the aspect ratio and the volume of the column, the diameter and density
of the grains, and the height of the water, the granular collapse acts like a
moving piston displacing the water. We also highlight that the density of the
falling grains has a negligible influence on the wave amplitude, which suggests
that the volume of grains entering the water is the relevant parameter in the
wave generation.

time-domain nonlinearity mitigation via the recently proposed learned digital
backpropagation (LDBP) with distributed compensation of polarization-mode

LDBP-PMD on multiple PMD realizations and show that it converges within 1% of
its peak dB performance after 428 training iterations on average, yielding a
peak effective signal-to-noise ratio of only 0.30 dB below the PMD-free case.
Similar to state-of-the-art lumped PMD compensation algorithms in practical
systems, our approach does not assume any knowledge about the particular PMD
realization along the link, nor any knowledge about the total accumulated PMD.
This is a significant improvement compared to prior work on distributed PMD
compensation, where knowledge about the accumulated PMD is typically assumed.
We also compare different parameterization choices in terms of performance,
complexity, and convergence behavior. Lastly, we demonstrate that the learned
models can be successfully retrained after an abrupt change of the PMD
realization along the fiber.

in electric double-layer field-effect transistors (FET). However, for the case
of single layer NbSe$_2$, FET doping is limited to $\approx 1\times 10^{14}$
cm$^{-2}$, while a somewhat larger charge injection can be obtained via
deposition of K atoms. Here, by performing ARPES, STM, quasiparticle
interference measurements, and first principles calculations we show that a
misfit compound formed by sandwiching NbSe$_2$ and LaSe layers behaves as a
NbSe$_2$ single layer with a rigid doping of $0.55-0.6$ electrons per Nb atom
or $\approx 6\times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$. Due to this huge doping, the $3\times3$

sandwiching TMDs layers with rock salt or other layers, our work paves the way

2D-to-3D pose uplifting. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the
most commonly used simplified projection models, which relate the estimated 3D
pose representation to 2D labels: normalized perspective and weak perspective
projections. Specifically, we derive theoretical lower bound errors for those
projection models under the commonly used mean per-joint position error
(MPJPE). Additionally, we show how the normalized perspective projection can be
replaced to avoid this guaranteed minimal error. We evaluate the derived lower
bounds on the most commonly used 3D human pose estimation benchmark datasets.
Our results show that both projection models lead to an inherent minimal error
between 19.3mm and 54.7mm, even after alignment in position and scale. This is
a considerable share when comparing with recent state-of-the-art results. Our
paper thus establishes a theoretical baseline that shows the importance of
suitable projection models in weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation.

by power spectral densities consisting of a single power-law component, ranging
from Brownian to white noise. Aims. The main goal here is to assess the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model by studying the range of its three parameters
that reproduces these statistical properties. Methods. We develop procedures
for extracting values of the three OU model parameters (mean flux, correlation
length, and random amplitude) from time series data, and apply them to compare
numerical integrations of the OU process with the Fermi-LAT data. Results. The
OU process fully describes the statistical properties of the flux variations of
the 236 blazars. The distributions of the extracted OU parameters are narrowly
peaked about well-defined values (sigma, mu, theta) = (0.2, -8.4, 0.5) with
variances (0.004, 0.07, 0.13). The distributions of rise and decay time scales
of flares in the numerical simulations, i.e. major flux variations fulfilling
pre-defined criteria, are in agreement with the observed ones. The power
spectral densities of the synthetic light curves are statistically
indistinguishable from those of the measured light curves. Conclusions.
Long-term gamma-ray flux variability of blazars on monthly time scales is well
described by a stochastic model involving only three parameters. The methods
described here are powerful tools to study randomness in light curves and
thereby constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for the observed flux
variations.

docking results indicated that naproxen, methadone, and amitriptyline
considering their higher binding energy, lower energy variance, and higher

complicated functions, compared to classical computing, so there is an
increasing interest in the relaxation dynamics of quantum spin systems.
Moreover, it is known that problems in quantum annealing caused by first order
phase transitions can be reduced via appropriate temporal adjustment of control
parameters, aimed at steering the system away from local minima. To do this
optimally, it would be helpful to predict the evolution of the system at the
level of macroscopic observables. Solving the dynamics of a quantum ensemble is
nontrivial, as it requires modelling not just the quantum spin system itself
but also its interaction with the environment, with which it exchanges energy.
An interesting alternative approach to the dynamics of quantum spin systems was
proposed about a decade ago. It involves creating a stochastic proxy dynamics
via the Suzuki-Trotter mapping of the quantum ensemble to a classical one (the
quantum Monte Carlo method), and deriving from this new dynamics closed
macroscopic equations for macroscopic observables, using the dynamical replica
method. In this chapter we give an introduction to this approach, focusing on
the ideas and assumptions behind the derivations, and on its potential and
limitations.

terms of classification performance. The task of spectral-spatial hyperspectral
image classification has remained challenging because of high intraclass
spectrum variability and low interclass spectral variability. This fact has
made the extraction of spatial information highly active. In this work, a novel
hyperspectral image classification framework using the fusion of dual spatial
information is proposed, in which the dual spatial information is built by both
exploiting pre-processing feature extraction and post-processing spatial
optimization. In the feature extraction stage, an adaptive texture smoothing
method is proposed to construct the structural profile (SP), which makes it
possible to precisely extract discriminative features from hyperspectral
images. The SP extraction method is used here for the first time in the remote
sensing community. Then, the extracted SP is fed into a spectral classifier. In
the spatial optimization stage, a pixel-level classifier is used to obtain the
class probability followed by an extended random walker-based spatial
optimization technique. Finally, a decision fusion rule is utilized to fuse the
class probabilities obtained by the two different stages. Experiments performed
on three data sets from different scenes illustrate that the proposed method
can outperform other state-of-the-art classification techniques. In addition,
the proposed feature extraction method, i.e., SP, can effectively improve the
discrimination between different land covers.

next-to-leading order (NLO) EOSs are introduced which contain renormalized

guide the asymptotic behavior of the introduced renormalized parameters, we
focus our analysis on two aspects: (i) With a minimum number of counterterms
introduced at NLO, we show that each energy contribution entering in the EOS
has a regular evolution with respect to the momentum cutoff (introduced in the
adopted regularization procedure) and is found to converge to a
cutoff-independent curve. The convergence features of each term are related to
its Fermi-momentum dependence. (ii) We find that the asymptotic evolution of

perturbative behavior, which in turns confirms that the adopted strategy is
coherent with a possible underlying power counting in the chosen

abstracting perturbed uncertain nonlinear ETC systems with general triggering

partitioned into regions, b) for each region an interval is determined,
containing all intersampling times of points in the region, and c) the
abstraction's transitions are determined through reachability analysis. To
determine intervals and transitions, we devise algorithms based on reachability

s$^{-1}$, respectively, while today it is $\approx 7.5\times 10^{17}$ s$^{-1}$.
Depending on whether the Sun originated as a slow, moderate or fast rotator,
thermal escape was the dominant escape process for the first 100 to 1000 Myr
after the formation of the solar system. If Titan's atmosphere originated that
early, it could have lost between $\approx 0.5 - 16$ times its present
atmospheric mass depending on the Sun's rotational evolution. We also
investigated the mass-balance parameter space for an outgassing of Titan's
nitrogen through decomposition of NH$_3$-ices in its deep interior. Our study
indicates that, if Titan's atmosphere originated at the beginning, it could
have only survived until today if the Sun was a slow rotator. In other cases,
the escape would have been too strong for the degassed nitrogen to survive
until present-day, implying later outgassing or an additional nitrogen source.
An endogenic origin of Titan's nitrogen partially through NH$_3$-ices is
consistent with its initial fractionation of $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N $\approx$ 166 -
172, or lower if photochemical removal was relevant for longer than the last
$\approx$ 1,000 Myr. Since this ratio is slightly above the ratio of cometary
ammonia, some of Titan's nitrogen might have originated from refractory
organics.

dimension of the space. On the other hand, the few existing results in the
infinite-dimensional setting only prove very weak types of convergence, owing
to weak assumptions on the problem. In particular, there are no results that
show convergence with a rate. In this article, we bridge these two worlds by
assuming more regularity of the optimization problem, which allows us to prove
convergence with an (optimal) sub-linear rate also in an infinite-dimensional
setting.
  In particular, we assume that the objective function is the expected value of
a family of convex differentiable functions. While we require that the full
objective function is strongly convex, we do not assume that its constituent
parts are so. Further, we require that the gradient satisfies a weak local
Lipschitz continuity property, where the Lipschitz constant may grow
polynomially given certain guarantees on the variance and higher moments near
the minimum.

associated with fixed costs and are ordered, forming a cascade. In each round,
a context is presented, and the learner selects the arms sequentially till some
depth. The total cost incurred by stopping at an arm is the sum of fixed costs
of arms selected and the stochastic loss associated with the arm. The learner's
goal is to learn a decision rule that maps contexts to arms with the goal of
minimizing the total expected loss. The problem is challenging as we are faced
with an unsupervised setting as the total loss cannot be estimated. Clearly,
learning is feasible only if the optimal arm can be inferred (explicitly or
implicitly) from the problem structure. We observe that learning is still
possible when the problem instance satisfies the so-called 'Contextual Weak

analysis in the same setup. High-quality MBE-grown (In,Ga,Mn)As films represent
an ideal testing ground, because of the non-centrosymmetric GaAs crystal
structure itself and In and Mn doping concentrations of few percent. Here we
present results of k-mapping and hXPD for the title compound with 3% In and 2.5
or 5.6% Mn using hard X-ray photons (3 to 5 keV) at beamline P22 at PETRA III
(DESY, Hamburg). Numerical processing (difference or ratio images) emphasizes
subtle differences of hXPD patterns like the fingerprint-like hXPD-signatures
of As and Ga sites. XPD calculations using the Bloch-wave method show a
one-to-one correspondence with the measurements. The hXPD results reveal a
predominant Ga substitutional site for Mn. Valence band mapping shows that the
Fermi energy lies within the valence band and decreases as the Mn concentration
increases. The results support the p-d Zener model of ferromagnetism in the
title compound. In addition to the shift of the Fermi energy, the band
splitting increases with increasing Mn content, which we attribute to an
increase of many-body correlations with increasing metallicity of the sample.

on the late stage of cosmic reionization because the relative velocity quickly
decreases. However, recent studies have suggested that the recombination in gas
clouds smaller than the local Jeans mass ($\lesssim$ $10^8~M_\odot$) can affect
the reionization history by boosting the number of ultraviolet photons required
for ionizing the intergalactic medium. Motivated by this, we performed a series
of radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to investigate whether the streaming
motion can generate variation in the local reionization history by smoothing
out clumpy small-scale structures and lowering the ionizing photon budget. We
found that the streaming velocity can add a variation of $\Delta z_e$ $\sim$
$0.05$ $-$ $0.5$ in the end-of-reionization redshift, depending on the level of
X-ray preheating and the time evolution of ionizing sources. The variation
tends to be larger when the ionizing efficiency of galaxies decreases toward
later times. Given the long spatial fluctuation scales of the streaming motion
($\gtrsim 100$ Mpc), it can help to explain the Ly$\alpha$ opacity variation
observed from quasars and leave large-scale imprints on the ionization field of
the intergalactic medium during the reionization. The pre-reionization heating
by X-ray sources is another critical factor that can suppress small-scale gas
clumping and can diminish the variation in $z_e$ introduced by the streaming
motion.

mmWave networks in an urban scenario, focusing on the trade-off between ABF and
HBF architectures. A multi-beam coverage model is derived as a function of
several UAV-specific parameters, including the number of UAVs, the deployment
altitude, the antenna configuration, and the beamforming design. Our results,
validated by simulation, show that, while ABF achieves better ergodic capacity
at high altitudes, an HBF configuration with multiple beams, despite the use of
more power-hungry RF blocks, consumes less power all the time with limited
capacity degradation.

unprecented precision, improving our understanding of the dark sector of the
Universe. Unfortunately, much of the cosmological information is encoded by the
small scales, where the clustering of dark matter and the effects of
astrophysical feedback processes are not fully understood. This can bias the
estimates of cosmological parameters, which we study here for a joint analysis
of mock Euclid cosmic shear and Planck cosmic microwave background data. We use
different implementations for the modelling of the signal on small scales and
find that they result in significantly different predictions. Moreover, the
different nonlinear corrections lead to biased parameter estimates, especially
when the analysis is extended into the highly nonlinear regime, with both the
Hubble constant, $H_0$, and the clustering amplitude, $\sigma_8$, affected the
most. Improvements in the modelling of nonlinear scales will therefore be
needed if we are to resolve the current tension with more and better data. For
a given prescription for the nonlinear power spectrum, using different
corrections for baryon physics does not significantly impact the precision of
Euclid, but neglecting these correction does lead to large biases in the
cosmological parameters. In order to extract precise and unbiased constraints
on cosmological parameters from Euclid cosmic shear data, it is therefore
essential to improve the accuracy of the recipes that account for nonlinear
structure formation, as well as the modelling of the impact of astrophysical
processes that redistribute the baryons.

varying the temporal resolution of the calculation and analyzing the patterns

ignore the security issues caused by an untrusted enclave. For instance, a
vulnerable (or even malicious) third-party enclave can be exploited to attack
the host application and the rest of the system. In this paper, we propose an
efficient mechanism to confine an untrusted enclave's behaviors. The threats of
an untrusted enclave come from the enclave-host asymmetries. They can be abused
to access arbitrary memory regions of its host application, jump to any code
location after leaving the enclave and forge the stack register to manipulate
the saved context. Our solution breaks such asymmetries and establishes mutual
distrust between the host application and the enclave. It leverages Intel MPK
for efficient memory isolation and the x86 single-step debugging mechanism to
capture the event when an enclave is existing. It then performs the integrity
check for the jump target and the stack pointer. We have solved two practical

modulation or pulsations as the main contenders. To shed new light on this
question, we analysed high-quality and high-cadence TESS photometric time
series for five Oef stars. We also collected a new time series of spectra for
one target (lambda Cep) which had been the subject of specific debates in the
last years. These observations reveal the variety of Oef behaviours. While
space-based photometric data reveal substantial red noise components in all
targets, only zeta Pup seems to display a long-lived periodicity. In our
sample, stars exhibit a dominant signal at low frequencies but it appears
relatively short-lived. This is reminiscent of rotational modulations by
transient photospheric spots, though this scenario is challenged by the case of
HD 14442, whose 1.230 d$^{-1}$ signal significantly exceeds the critical
rotational frequency. In parallel, no evidence of persistent p-mode non-radial
pulsations is found in either photometry or spectroscopy of the stars, only
temporary excitation of g-mode pulsations could offer an alternative
explanation for the dominant signals. Finally, the revised luminosities of the
stars using GAIA-DR2 show that they are not all supergiants as zeta Pup. The
question then arises whether the Oef peculiarity denotes a homogeneous class of
objects after all.

event, with a sufficiently tight localisation skymap, would allow telescopes to
point in the direction of the potential electromagnetic counterpart before its
onset. This will enable astronomers to extract valuable information of the
complex astrophysical phenomena triggered around the time of the merger. Use of
higher-modes of gravitational radiation, in addition to the dominant mode
typically used in templated real-time searches, was recently shown to produce
significant improvements in early-warning times and skyarea localisations for a
range of asymmetric-mass binaries. In this work, we perform a large-scale study
to assess the benefits of this method for a population of compact binary merger
observations. In particular, we inject 100,000 such signals in Gaussian noise,
with component masses $m_1 \in \left[1, 60 \right] M_{\odot}$ and $m_2 \in
\left [1, 3 \right] M_{\odot}$. We consider three scenarios involving
ground-based detectors: the fifth (O5) observing run of the Advanced
LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network, its projected Voyager upgrade, as well as a proposed
third generation (3G) network. We find that for fixed early warning times of
$20-60$ seconds, the inclusion of the higher modes can provide localisation
improvements of a factor of $\gtrsim 2$ for up to $\sim 60\%$ ($70 \%$) of the
neutron star-black hole systems in the O5 (Voyager) scenario. Considering only
those neutron star-black hole systems which can produce potential
electromagnetic counterparts, such improvements in the localisation can be
expected for $\sim 5-35\%$ $(20-50\%)$ binaries in O5 (Voyager), although the
localisation areas themselves depend on the distances. For the 3G scenario, a
significant fraction of the events have time gains of a minute to several

transformation and neighborhood aggregation for node representation learning.
Recently, some work shows that coupling is inferior to decoupling, which
supports deep graph propagation better and has become the latest paradigm of
GCN (e.g., APPNP and SGCN). Despite effectiveness, the working mechanisms of
the decoupled GCN are not well understood. In this paper, we explore the
decoupled GCN for semi-supervised node classification from a novel and
fundamental perspective -- label propagation. We conduct thorough theoretical
analyses, proving that the decoupled GCN is essentially the same as the
two-step label propagation: first, propagating the known labels along the graph
to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled nodes, and second, training normal
neural network classifiers on the augmented pseudo-labeled data. More
interestingly, we reveal the effectiveness of decoupled GCN: going beyond the
conventional label propagation, it could automatically assign structure- and
model- aware weights to the pseudo-label data. This explains why the decoupled
GCN is relatively robust to the structure noise and over-smoothing, but
sensitive to the label noise and model initialization. Based on this insight,
we propose a new label propagation method named Propagation then Training
Adaptively (PTA), which overcomes the flaws of the decoupled GCN with a dynamic
and adaptive weighting strategy. Our PTA is simple yet more effective and
robust than decoupled GCN. We empirically validate our findings on four
benchmark datasets, demonstrating the advantages of our method. The code is

alternative approach: a Semi-autoregressive Bottom-up Parser (SmBoP) that
constructs at decoding step $t$ the top-$K$ sub-trees of height $\leq t$. Our
parser enjoys several benefits compared to top-down autoregressive parsing.
From an efficiency perspective, bottom-up parsing allows to decode all
sub-trees of a certain height in parallel, leading to logarithmic runtime
complexity rather than linear. From a modeling perspective, a bottom-up parser
learns representations for meaningful semantic sub-programs at each step,
rather than for semantically-vacuous partial trees. We apply SmBoP on Spider, a
challenging zero-shot semantic parsing benchmark, and show that SmBoP leads to
a 2.2x speed-up in decoding time and a $\sim$5x speed-up in training time,

(supra)molecular adsorbates in liquid environment remains a key challenge in
many branches of science. Mechanical resonators can uniquely determine the mass
of essentially any adsorbate; yet, when operating in liquid environment, the
liquid dynamically coupled to the adsorbate contributes significantly to the
measured response, which complicates data interpretation and impairs
quantitative adsorbate mass determination. Employing the Navier-Stokes equation
for liquid velocity in contact with an oscillating surface, we show that the
liquid contribution can be eliminated by measuring the response in solutions
with identical kinematic viscosity but different densities. Guided by this
insight, we used quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), one of the most
widely-employed mechanical resonator, to demonstrate that kinematic-viscosity
matching can be utilized to accurately quantify the dry mass of systems such as
adsorbed rigid nanoparticles, tethered biological nanoparticles (lipid
vesicles), as well as highly hydrated polymeric films. The same approach
applied to the simultaneously measured energy dissipation made it possible to
quantify the mechanical properties of the adsorbate and its attachment to the
surface, as demonstrated by, for example, probing the hydrodynamic stablization
induced by nanoparticles crowding. Finally, we envision that the possibility to
simultaneously determine the dry mass and mechanical properties of adsorbates
as well as the liquid contributions will provide the experimental tools to use
mechanical resonators for applications beyond mass determination, as for
example to directly interrogate the orientation, spatial distribution, and
binding strength of adsorbates without the need for complementary techniques.

possibility that this wide smectic-A phase is merely an artifact caused by the

explicitly for cations and anions in ILCs. Our present findings, obtained by
grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, show that the phase transitions

forms, at low temperatures and within an intermediate density range, in between

calculated via height spectrum of waveforms with 6-us shaping time. It is

networks (CNNs) in image denoising. Albeit deeper network and larger model
capacity generally benefit performance, it remains a challenging practical
issue to train a very deep image denoising network. Using multilevel
wavelet-CNN (MWCNN) as an example, we empirically find that the denoising
performance cannot be significantly improved by either increasing wavelet
decomposition levels or increasing convolution layers within each level. To
cope with this issue, this paper presents a multi-level wavelet residual
network (MWRN) architecture as well as a progressive training (PTMWRN) scheme
to improve image denoising performance. In contrast to MWCNN, our MWRN
introduces several residual blocks after each level of discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) and before inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT). For
easing the training difficulty, scale-specific loss is applied to each level of
MWRN by requiring the intermediate output to approximate the corresponding
wavelet subbands of ground-truth clean image. To ensure the effectiveness of
scale-specific loss, we also take the wavelet subbands of noisy image as the
input to each scale of the encoder. Furthermore, progressive training scheme is
adopted for better learning of MWRN by beigining with training the lowest level
of MWRN and progressively training the upper levels to bring more fine details
to denoising results. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy images
show that our PT-MWRN performs favorably against the state-of-the-art denoising
methods in terms both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

lattices with open boundaries, is an exotic manifestation of non-Hermitian
systems. In Bloch theory, an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is generally
used to describe dissipation, which however is not norm-preserving and neglects
quantum jumps. Here it is shown that in a self-consistent description of the
dissipative dynamics in a one-band lattice, based on the stochastic
Schr\""odinger equation or Lindblad master equation with a collective jump
operator, the skin effect and its dynamical features are washed out.
Nevertheless, both short- and long-time relaxation dynamics provide a hidden
signature of the skin effect found in the semiclassical limit. In particular,
relaxation toward a maximally mixed state with the largest von Neumann entropy
in a lattice with open boundaries is a manifestation of the semiclassical skin
effect.

mission at Jupiter, provided measurements with unprecedented accuracy of the
gravity and magnetic fields of the two gas giants. Using the gravity
measurements, it was found that the strong zonal flows observed at the
cloud-level of the gas giants are likely to extend thousands of kilometers deep
into the planetary interior. However, the gravity measurements alone, which are
by definition an integrative measure of mass, cannot constrain with high
certainty the exact vertical structure of the flow. Taking into account the
recent Cassini magnetic field measurements of Saturn, and past secular
variations of Jupiter's magnetic field, we obtain an additional physical
constraint on the vertical decay profile of the observed zonal flows on these
planets. Our combined gravity-magnetic analysis reveals that the cloud-level
winds on Saturn (Jupiter) extend with very little decay, i.e., barotropically,
down to a depth of around 7,000~km (2,000~km) and then decay rapidly in the
semiconducting region, so that within the next 1,000 km (600~km) their value
reduces to about 1\% of that at the cloud-level. These results indicate that
there is no significant mechanism acting to decay the flow in the outer neutral
region, and that the interaction with the magnetic field in the semiconducting
region might play a central role in the decay of the flows.

unusual accretion-powered intermediate polar that harbors a fast-spinning white
dwarf (WD) with a spin period of $29.6$ s. The low X-ray luminosity and the
relatively modest accretion rate per unit area suggest that the shock is not
occurring near the WD surface. It has been argued that, under these conditions,
the maximum temperature of the shock cannot be directly used to determine the
mass of the WD (which, under the abovementioned assumptions, would be around
$0.46$ $M_\odot$). Here, we explore the stability of this rapidly rotating WD
using a modern equation of state (EoS) that accounts for electron--ion,
electron--electron, and ion--ion interactions. For this EoS, we determine the
mass density thresholds for the onset of pycnonuclear fusion reactions and
study the impact of microscopic stability and rapid rotation on the structure
and stability of WDs, considering them with helium, carbon, oxygen, and neon.
From this analysis, we obtain a minimum mass for CTCV J2056--3014 of
$0.56~M_\odot$ and a maximum mass of around $1.38~M_\odot$. If the mass of CTCV
J2056--3014 is close to the lower mass limit, its equatorial radius would be on
the order of $10^4$~km due to rapid rotation. Such a radius is significantly
larger than that of a nonrotating WD of average mass ($0.6\, M_\odot$), which
is on the order of $7\times 10^3$~km. The effects on the minimum mass of
J2056-3014 due to changes in the temperature and composition of the stellar
matter were found to be negligibly small.

{systems}, the solutions starting from a fixed point $q$ are true geodesics for
a family of Riemannian metrics on the image submanifold ${\mathcal M}^{nh}_q$
of the nonholonomic exponential map. This implies a surprising result: the
kinetic nonholonomic trajectories with starting point $q$, for sufficiently
small times, minimize length in ${\mathcal M}^{nh}_q$!

be used to gain a better understanding of healthy and pathological heart
function. Measurements such as long-axis strain as well as peak strain rates
provide markers of systolic function. Likewise, early and late-diastolic
filling velocities are used as indicators of diastolic function. Quantifying
global strains, however, requires a fast and precise method of tracking
long-axis motion throughout the cardiac cycle. Valve landmarks such as the
insertion of leaflets into the myocardial wall provide features that can be
tracked to measure global long-axis motion. Feature tracking methods require
initialisation, which can be time-consuming in studies with large cohorts.
Therefore, this study developed and trained a neural network to identify ten
features from unlabeled long-axis MR images: six mitral valve points from three
long-axis views, two aortic valve points and two tricuspid valve points. This
study used manual annotations of valve landmarks in standard 2-, 3- and
4-chamber long-axis images collected in clinical scans to train the network.
The accuracy in the identification of these ten features, in pixel distance,
was compared with the accuracy of two commonly used feature tracking methods as
well as the inter-observer variability of manual annotations. Clinical
measures, such as valve landmark strain and motion between end-diastole and
end-systole, are also presented to illustrate the utility and robustness of the
method.

humans. Classical methods optimize both the data-to-model correspondences and
the human model parameters (pose and shape), but are reliable only when
initialized close to the solution. Some methods initialize the optimization
based on fully supervised correspondence predictors, which is not
differentiable end-to-end, and can only process a single scan at a time. Our
main contribution is LoopReg, an end-to-end learning framework to register a
corpus of scans to a common 3D human model. The key idea is to create a
self-supervised loop. A backward map, parameterized by a Neural Network,
predicts the correspondence from every scan point to the surface of the human
model. A forward map, parameterized by a human model, transforms the
corresponding points back to the scan based on the model parameters (pose and
shape), thus closing the loop. Formulating this closed loop is not
straightforward because it is not trivial to force the output of the NN to be
on the surface of the human model - outside this surface the human model is not
even defined. To this end, we propose two key innovations. First, we define the
canonical surface implicitly as the zero level set of a distance field in R3,
which in contrast to morecommon UV parameterizations, does not require cutting
the surface, does not have discontinuities, and does not induce distortion.
Second, we diffuse the human model to the 3D domain R3. This allows to map the
NN predictions forward,even when they slightly deviate from the zero level set.
Results demonstrate that we can train LoopRegmainly self-supervised - following
a supervised warm-start, the model becomes increasingly more accurate as
additional unlabelled raw scans are processed. Our code and pre-trained models
can be downloaded for research.

recursion-theoretic and combinatorial methods (Friedman, Marcone, Montalban et

Freund, Girard, Rathjen, Thomson, Valencia Vizcano, Weiermann et al.),
employing deduction search trees and cut elimination theorems in infinitary
logics with ordinal bounds in the latter case. At type level one, the
well-ordering principles are of the form (*) ""if X is well-ordered then f(X) is
well-ordered"" where f is a standard proof theoretic function from ordinals to
ordinals (such f's are always dilators). One aim of the paper is to present a
general methodology underlying these results that enables one to construct
omega-models of particular theories from (*) and even beta-models from the type
2 version of (*).
  As (*) is of complexity Pi-1-2 such a principle cannot characterize stronger
comprehensions at the level of Pi-1-1-comprehension. This requires a higher
order version of (*) that employs ideas from ordinal representation systems
with collapsing functions used in impredicative proof theory. The simplest one
is the Bachmann construction. Relativizing the latter construction to any
dilator f and asserting that this always yields a well-ordering turns out to be
equivalent to Pi-1-1-comprehension. This result has been conjectured and a
proof strategy adumbrated roughly 10 years ago, but the proof has only been

pooling operation with a precise geometric interpretation, that allows handling
variations in the mesh connectivity by clustering mesh faces in a task-driven
fashion. We provide theoretical insights of our approach using tools from the

techniques, based on unitarity and analyticity, we first derive an $S$-matrix
free of infrared divergences. This is achieved by removing a divergent phase
factor due to the interactions mediated by the massless particles in the
crossed channels, a procedure that is related to previous formalisms to treat
infrared divergences. We apply this method in detail by unitarizing the Born
terms for graviton-graviton scattering in pure gravity and we find a scalar
graviton-graviton resonance with vacuum quantum numbers ($J^{PC}=0^{++}$) that
we call the \textit{graviball}. Remarkably, this resonance is located below the
Planck mass but deep in the complex $s$-plane (with $s$ the usual Mandelstam
variable), so that its effects along the physical real $s$ axis peak for values
significantly lower than this scale. We argue that the position and width of
the graviball are reduced when including extra light fields in the theory. This
could lead to phenomenological consequences in scenarios of quantum gravity
with a large number of such fields or, in general, with a low-energy
ultraviolet completion. We also apply this formalism to two non-relativistic
potentials with exact known solutions for the scattering amplitudes: Coulomb
scattering and an energy-dependent potential obtained from the Coulomb one with
a zero at threshold. This latter case shares the same $J=0$ partial-wave
projected Born term as the graviton-graviton case, except for a global factor.
We find that the relevant resonance structure of these examples is reproduced
by our methods, which represents a strong indication of their robustness.

yield is then measured as a function of landing energy between $1.2$ and $1.8$
keV and found to be in the range of $0.1$ ($1.2$ keV) to $0.9$ ($1.8$ keV).
These results are in agreement to data obtained by a different, independent
method. We therefore conclude that the prototype TiPC is able to characterise
the thin films in terms of transmission secondary electron yield. Additionally,
observed features which are unrelated to the yield determination are
interpreted.

industries. Local differential privacy (LDP) offers a rigorous approach to
preserving privacy whereby the individual privatises their data locally,

provides a provable privacy guarantee to the individual against both
adversaries and database administrators. Existing LDP mechanisms have
successfully been applied to low-dimensional data, but in high dimensions the
privacy-inducing noise largely destroys the utility of the data. In this work,
our contributions are two-fold: first, by adapting state-of-the-art techniques
from representation learning, we introduce a novel approach to learning LDP
mechanisms. These mechanisms add noise to powerful representations on the
low-dimensional manifold underlying the data, thereby overcoming the
prohibitive noise requirements of LDP in high dimensions. Second, we introduce
a novel denoising approach for downstream model learning. The training of
performant machine learning models using collected LDP data is a common goal
for data collectors, and downstream model performance forms a proxy for the LDP
data utility. Our approach significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art
LDP mechanisms.

magnetic field orientation over the central 1000 au envelope scales and
compared it to that of the protostellar outflow in order to study the relation

discover a strong relationship between the misalignment of the magnetic field

the kinetic and the magnetic energy at envelope scales. The relation could be
driven by favored B misalignments in more dynamical envelopes or a dependence
of the envelope dynamics with the large-scale B initial configuration.
Comparing the trend with the presence of fragmentation, we observe that single
sources are mostly associated with conditions of low angular momentum in the
inner envelope and good alignment of the magnetic field with protostellar
outflows, at intermediate scales. Our results suggest that the properties of
the magnetic field in protostellar envelopes bear a tight relationship with the

semi-metals, semiconductors, and a topological insulator. When the half-Heusler
compound is incorporated into the device, the control of high lattice thermal
conductivity owing to high crystal symmetry is a challenge for the thermal
manager of the device. The calculation for the prediction of lattice thermal
conductivity, which is an important physical parameter for controlling the
thermal management of the device, requires a calculation cost of several 100
times as much as the usual density functional theory calculation. Therefore, we
examined whether lattice thermal conductivity prediction by machine learning
was possible on the basis of only the atomic information of constituent
elements for thermal conductivity calculated by the density functional theory
calculation in various half-Heusler compounds. Consequently, we constructed a
machine learning model, which can predict the lattice thermal conductivity with
high accuracy from the information of only atomic radius and atomic mass of
each site in the half-Heusler type crystal structure. Applying our results, the
lattice thermal conductivity for an unknown half-Heusler compound can be

a empirical bayes framework to evaluate AE level RRs. The regression part can
handle both excess zeros and over dispersion in the data, and the empirical

the spatial distribution of sardine eggs density (eggs/$m^3$). The results
showed that the combined model for zero-inflated and extreme values improved

medium, yet their internal physical conditions and formation mechanism remain
debated. Aims. We study the kinematics and physical conditions in the Musca
filament and the Chamaeleon-Musca complex to constrain the physics of filament
formation. Methods. We produced CO(2-1) isotopologue maps with the APEX
telescope that cut through the Musca filament. We further study a NANTEN2
$^{12}$CO(1-0) map of the Musca cloud and the HI emission of the
Chamaeleon-Musca complex. Results. The Musca cloud contains multiple velocity
components. Radiative transfer modelling of the CO emission indicates that the
Musca filament consists of a cold ($\sim$10 K), dense (n$_{H_2}\sim$10$^4$
cm$^{-3}$) crest, which is best described with a cylindrical geometry.
Connected to the crest, a separate gas component at T$\sim$15 K and
n$_{H_2}\sim$10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$ is found, the so-called strands. The filament
crest has a transverse velocity gradient that is linked to the kinematics of
the nearby ambient cloud. Studying the large scale kinematics, we find
coherence of the asymmetric kinematics from the 50 pc HI cloud down to the
Musca filament. We also report a strong [C$^{18}$O]/[$^{13}$CO] abundance drop
by an order of magnitude from the filament crest to the strands over a distance
$<$ 0.2 pc in a weak far-ultraviolet (FUV) field. Conclusions. The dense Musca
filament crest is a long-lived (several crossing times), dynamic structure that
can form stars in the near future because of continuous mass accretion. This
mass accretion appears to be triggered by a HI cloud-cloud collision, which
bends the magnetic field around dense filaments. This bending of the magnetic
field is then responsible for the observed asymmetric accretion scenario of the
Musca filament, which is, for instance, seen as a V-shape in the
position-velocity (PV) diagram.

is helpful to VAD, but the performance improvement is limited. To address this
issue, here we propose a speech enhancement aided end-to-end multi-task model
for VAD. The model has two decoders, one for speech enhancement and the other
for VAD. The two decoders share the same encoder and speech separation network.
Unlike the direct thought that takes two separated objectives for VAD and
speech enhancement respectively, here we propose a new joint optimization
objective -- VAD-masked scale-invariant source-to-distortion ratio (mSI-SDR).
mSI-SDR uses VAD information to mask the output of the speech enhancement
decoder in the training process. It makes the VAD and speech enhancement tasks
jointly optimized not only at the shared encoder and separation network, but
also at the objective level. It also satisfies real-time working requirement
theoretically. Experimental results show that the multi-task method
significantly outperforms its single-task VAD counterpart. Moreover, mSI-SDR
outperforms SI-SDR in the same multi-task setting.

fermions with a deterministic aperiodic potential in the presence of long-range
interactions decaying as power-law $V_{ij}/(r_i-r_j)^\alpha$ with distance and
having random coefficients $V_{ij}$. We demonstrate that MBL survives even for
$\alpha <1$ and is preceded by a broad non-ergodic sub-diffusive phase.
Starting from parameters at which the short-range interacting system shows
infinite temperature MBL phase, turning on random power-law interactions
results in many-body mobility edges in the spectrum with a larger fraction of
ergodic delocalized states for smaller values of $\alpha$. Hence, the critical
disorder $h_c^r$, at which ergodic to non-ergodic transition takes place
increases with the range of interactions. Time evolution of the density
imbalance $I(t)$, which has power-law decay $I(t) \sim t^{-\gamma}$ in the
intermediate to large time regime, shows that the critical disorder $h_{c}^I$,
above which the system becomes diffusion-less (with $\gamma \sim 0$) and
transits into the MBL phase is much larger than $h_c^r$. In between $h_{c}^r$
and $h_{c}^I$ there is a broad non-ergodic sub-diffusive phase, which is
characterized by the Poissonian statistics for the level spacing ratio,
multifractal eigenfunctions and a non zero dynamical exponent $\gamma \ll 1/2$.
The system continues to be sub-diffusive even on the ergodic side ($h < h_c^r$)
of the MBL transition, where the eigenstates near the mobility edges are
multifractal. For $h < h_{0}<h_c^r$, the system is super-diffusive with $\gamma
>1/2$. The rich phase diagram obtained here is unique to random nature of
long-range interactions. We explain this in terms of the enhanced correlations
among local energies of the effective Anderson model induced by random
power-law interactions.

stationary point vortices embedded in a background sea of Liouville-type
vorticity that is exponentially related to the stream function. The input to
the construction is a ""pure"" point vortex equilibrium in a background
irrotational flow. Pure point vortex equilibria also appear as a parameter $A$
in the hybrid solutions approaches the limits $A\to 0,\infty$. While $A\to 0$
reproduces the input equilibrium, $A\to\infty$ produces a new pure point vortex
equilibrium. We refer to the family of hybrid equilibria continuously
parametrised by $A$ as a ""Liouville link"". In some cases, the emergent point
vortex equilibrium as $A\to\infty$ can itself be the input for a second family
of hybrid equilibria linking, in a limit, to yet another pure point vortex
equilibrium. In this way, Liouville links together form a ""Liouville chain"". We
discuss several examples of Liouville chains and demonstrate that they can have
a finite or an infinite number of links. We show here that the class of hybrid

for comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko using Rosetta-ROSINA data. D-methanol
(CH3OD and CH2DOH combined) and D2-methanol (CH2DOD and CHD2OH combined) have
an abundance of 5.5+/-0.46 and 0.00069+/-0.00014 per cent relative to normal
methanol. The data span a methanol deuteration fraction (D/H ratio) in the
0.71-6.6 per cent range, accounting for statistical corrections for the
location of D in the molecule and including statistical error propagation in
the ROSINA measurements. It is argued that cometary CH2DOH forms from CO
hydrogenation to CH3OH and subsequent H-D substitution reactions in CH3-R.
CHD2OH is likely produced from deuterated formaldehyde. Meanwhile, CH3OD and
CH2DOD, could form via H-D exchange reactions in OH-R in the presence of
deuterated water ice. Methanol formation and deuteration is argued to occur at
the same epoch as D2O formation from HDO, with formation of mono-deuterated
water, hydrogen sulfide, and ammonia occurring prior to that. The cometary
D-methanol/methanol ratio is demonstrated to agree most closely with that in
prestellar cores and low-mass protostellar regions. The results suggest that
cometary methanol stems from the innate cold (10-20 K) prestellar core that
birthed our Solar System. Cometary volatiles individually reflect the
evolutionary phases of star formation from cloud to core to protostar.

account for both scenarios where noise is entirely exogenous to peer influence

maintain some uniqueness in their opinions. We derive a general analytical
expression for opinion diversity, which holds for any network and depends on
the network's topology through its spectral properties alone. Using this
expression, we find that opinion diversity decreases as communities and
clusters are broken down. We test our predictions against data describing

increasing and thus enterprise IoT (EIoT) is seemingly shifting from hype to
reality. However, the actual use of EIoT over significant timescales has not
been empirically analyzed. In other words, the reality remains unexplored.
Furthermore, despite the variety of EIoT verticals, the use of IoT across
vertical industries has not been compared. This paper uses a two-year EIoT
dataset from a major Finnish mobile network operator to investigate device use
across industries, cellular traffic patterns, and mobility patterns. We present
a variety of novel findings: EIoT traffic volume per device has increased
three-fold over the last two years, the share of LTE-enabled devices has
remained low at around 2% and that 30% of EIoT devices are still 2G only, and
there are order of magnitude differences between different industries' EIoT
traffic and mobility. We also show that daily traffic can be clustered into
only three patterns, differing mainly in the presence and timing of a peak
hour. Beyond these descriptive results, modeling and forecasting is conducted
for both traffic and mobility. We forecast the total daily EIoT traffic through
a temporal regression model and achieve an error of about 15% over medium-term
(30 to 180 day) horizons. We also model device mobility through a Markov
mixture model and quantify the upper bound of predictability for device
mobility.

covariates have on the heterogeneity in trajectories. The inclusion of
covariates associated with latent classes allows for a more clear understanding
of individual differences and a more meaningful interpretation of latent class
membership. Many theoretical and empirical studies have focused on
investigating heterogeneity in change patterns of a univariate repeated outcome
and examining the effects on baseline covariates that inform the cluster
formation. However, developmental processes rarely unfold in isolation;
therefore, empirical researchers often desire to examine two or more outcomes
over time, hoping to understand their joint development where these outcomes
and their change patterns are correlated. This study examines the heterogeneity
in parallel nonlinear trajectories and identifies baseline characteristics as
predictors of latent classes. Our simulation studies show that the proposed
model can tell the clusters of parallel trajectories apart and provide unbiased
and accurate point estimates with target coverage probabilities for the
parameters of interest in general. We illustrate how to apply the model to
investigate the heterogeneity in the joint development of reading and

demonstrate how to select covariates that contribute the most to the latent

hence a major safety issue for electric vehicles. An internal short circuit
with low resistance is called a hard internal short, which causes a high
internal current flow that leads to an extremely fast temperature rise, gas
generation, cell swelling, and ultimately battery rupture and failure. Thus it
is crucial to detect these faults immediately after they get triggered. In
large battery packs with many cells in parallel, detecting an internal short
circuit event using voltage is difficult due to suppression of the voltage
signal from the faulty cell by the other healthy cells connected in parallel.
In contrast, analyzing the gas composition in the pack enclosure can provide a
robust single cell failure detection method. At elevated temperature,
decomposition of the battery materials results in gas generation and cell
swelling. The cell structure is designed to rupture at a critical gas pressure
and vent the accumulated $CO_2$ gas, in order to prevent explosive forces. In
this paper, we extend our previous work by combining the models of cell thermal
dynamics, swelling, and $CO_2$ gas generation. In particular, we developed a
fast and high confidence level detection method of hard internal short circuit
events for a battery pack by measuring cell expansion force and monitoring
$CO_2$ concentrations in a pack enclosure.

not independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). This paper tackles this
problem by constructing an estimator from a martingale difference sequence
(MDS) for the dependent samples. In the data-generating process, we do not
assume the convergence of the policy, but the policy uses the same conditional
probability of choosing an action during a certain period. Then, we derive an
asymptotically normal estimator of the value of an evaluation policy. As
another advantage of our method, the batch-based approach simultaneously solves
the deficient support problem. Using benchmark and real-world datasets, we
experimentally confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

one of the most promising and yet most challenging instantiations of mobile
ad-hoc network technologies. The deployment of such networks in large scale
requires the enforcement of stringent security mechanisms that need to abide by
the technical, societal, legal, and economical requirements of Intelligent
Transportation Systems. Authentication is an effective process for validating
user identity in vehicular netoworks. However, it cannot guarantee the network
security by itself. Available industrial standards do not consider methods to
promptly revoke misbehaving vehicles. The only available protection consists on
the \textit{revocation by expiry}, which tolerates the misbehaving vehicle to
remain trusted in the system for a long time (e.g. 3 months with certificate
pre-loading according to EU security policy). This poses a huge yet dangerous
limitation to the security of the vehicular ecosystem. In this work we propose
a Distributed Ledger-based Certificate Revocation Scheme for Vehicular Ad-hoc

Ledger Technology (DLT) to implement a privacy-aware revocation process that is
fully transparent to all participating entities and meets the critical message

where the DLT streamlines the revocation operation overhead and delivers an
economic solution against cyber-attacks in vehicular systems.

the former faces the scalability issue when the number of nodes increases. For
some tasks, only the result of data fusion is needed. Then, the whole process
can be realized in an efficient way, integrating the data collection and fusion
in one step by over-the-air computation (AirComp). Its shortcoming, however, is
signal distortion when channel gains of nodes are different, which cannot be
well solved by transmission power control alone in times of deep fading. To
address this issue, in this paper, we propose a multi-slot over-the-air
computation (MS-AirComp) framework for the sum estimation in fading channels.
Compared with conventional data collection (one slot for each node) and AirComp
(one slot for all nodes), MS-AirComp is an alternative policy that lies between
them, exploiting multiple slots to improve channel gains so as to facilitate
power control. Specifically, the transmissions are distributed over multiple
slots and a threshold of channel gain is set for distributed transmission
scheduling. Each node transmits its signal only once, in the slot when its
channel gain first gets above the threshold, or in the last slot when its
channel gain remains below the threshold. Theoretical analysis gives the
closed-form of the computation error in fading channels, based on which the
optimal parameters are found. Noticing that computation error tends to be
reduced at the cost of more transmission power, a method is suggested to
control the increase of transmission power. Simulations confirm that the
proposed method can effectively reduce computation error, compared with
state-of-the-art methods.

context of accelerating anthropogenic ecological changes. Although biological
invasion success could be explained by the lack of natural enemies in new
regions, recent studies have revealed that resident herbivores often do have a
substantial effect on both native and invasive plants. Very few studies have
included consideration of native plant resistance while estimating methods of
controlling invasion; hence, it is unclear to what extent the interactive
effects of controlling approaches and native plants' resistance could slow down
or even inhibit biological invasion. We developed a spatial modeling framework,
using a paired logistic equation model, with considerations of the dispersal
processes, to capture the dynamics change of native and invasive plants under
various strategies of control. We found that when biocontrol agents could have
a strong effect on invasive plant, that could almost completely limit the
invasion, together with a high native plant resistance. However, a high
application frequency is needed make an efficient impact, whereas, a low
frequency treatment leads to nearly the same outcome as the no treatment case.
Lastly, we showed that evenly controlling a larger area with a weaker effect
still lead to a better outcome than focusing on small patches with a stronger
effect. Overall, this study has some management implications, such as how to
determine the optimal allocation strategy.

unstructured text sources. More specifically, we seek to extract drug-disease
pairs of potential cures to diseases by a simple reasoning over the structure

  Materials and Methods: We use Google Cloud to transcribe podcast episodes of
an NPR radio show. We then build a pipeline for systematically pre-processing
the text to ensure quality input to the core classification model, which feeds
to a series of post-processing steps for obtaining filtered results. Our
classification model itself uses a language model pre-trained on PubMed text.
The modular nature of our pipeline allows for ease of future developments in
this area by substituting higher quality components at each stage of the
pipeline. As a validation measure, we use ROBOKOP, an engine over a medical
knowledge graph with only validated pathways, as a ground truth source for
checking the existence of the proposed pairs. For the proposed pairs not found
in ROBOKOP, we provide further verification using Chemotext.
  Results: We found 30.4% of our proposed pairs in the ROBOKOP database. For
example, our model successfully identified that Omeprazole can help treat
heartburn.We discuss the significance of this result, showing some examples of
the proposed pairs.
  Discussion and Conclusion: The agreement of our results with the existing
knowledge source indicates a step in the right direction. Given the
plug-and-play nature of our framework, it is easy to add, remove, or modify
parts to improve the model as necessary. We discuss the results showing some
examples, and note that this is a potentially new line of research that has
further scope to be explored. Although our approach was originally oriented on
radio podcast transcripts, it is input-agnostic and could be applied to any
source of textual data and to any problem of interest.

through the combustion of an atomized precursor solution; this process has
applications in catalysts, battery materials, and pigments. Current limitations
revolve around understanding how to consistently achieve a stable flame and the
reliable production of nanoparticles. Machine learning and artificial
intelligence algorithms that detect unstable flame conditions in real time may
be a means of streamlining the synthesis process and improving FSP efficiency.
In this study, the FSP flame stability is first quantified by analyzing the
brightness of the flame's anchor point. This analysis is then used to label
data for both unsupervised and supervised machine learning approaches. The
unsupervised learning approach allows for autonomous labelling and
classification of new data by representing data in a reduced dimensional space
and identifying combinations of features that most effectively cluster it. The
supervised learning approach, on the other hand, requires human labeling of
training and test data, but is able to classify multiple objects of interest
(such as the burner and pilot flames) within the video feed. The accuracy of
each of these techniques is compared against the evaluations of human experts.
Both the unsupervised and supervised approaches can track and classify FSP
flame conditions in real time to alert users of unstable flame conditions. This
research has the potential to autonomously track and manage flame spray
pyrolysis as well as other flame technologies by monitoring and classifying the
flame stability.

  Detection",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose the use of Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)
imaging for the problem of iris presentation attack (PA) detection. We assess
its viability by comparing its performance with respect to traditional iris
imaging modalities, viz., near-infrared (NIR) and visible spectrum. OCT imaging
provides a cross-sectional view of an eye, whereas traditional imaging provides
2D iris textural information. PA detection is performed using three
state-of-the-art deep architectures (VGG19, ResNet50 and DenseNet121) to
differentiate between bonafide and PA samples for each of the three imaging
modalities. Experiments are performed on a dataset of 2,169 bonafide, 177 Van
Dyke eyes and 360 cosmetic contact images acquired using all three imaging
modalities under intra-attack (known PAs) and cross-attack (unknown PAs)
scenarios. We observe promising results demonstrating OCT as a viable solution
for iris presentation attack detection.

experimental study of high ultrafast laser ablation efficiency for processing
of copper and steel with single-pulses, MHz-, GHz- and burst in the burst
(biburst) regime. The comparison of burst, biburst, and single-pulse ablation
efficiencies was performed for beam-size-optimised regimes, showing the real
advantages and disadvantages of milling and drilling processing approaches.
Highly-efficient ultrashort pulse laser processing was achieved for ~1 um
optical wavelength: 8.8 um3/uJ for copper drilling, 5.6 um3/uJ for copper
milling, and 6.9 um3/uJ for steel milling. We believe that the huge
experimental data collected in this study will serve well for the better
understanding of laser burst-matter interaction and theoretical modelling.
