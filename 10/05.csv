method of channel prediction during the GA link blockage at 28 GHz. In our
approach, the multipath components (MPCs) along a UAV flight trajectory are
arranged into independent path bins based on the minimum Euclidean distance
among the channel parameters of the MPCs. After the arrangement, the channel
parameters of the MPCs in individual path bins are forecasted during the

essential application is the use of PMU data for real-time event
identification. However, how to take full advantage of all PMU data in event
identification is still an open problem. Thus, we propose a novel method that
performs event identification by mining interaction graphs among different
PMUs. The proposed interaction graph inference method follows an entirely
data-driven manner without knowing the physical topology. Moreover, unlike
previous works that treat interactive learning and event identification as two
different stages, our method learns interactions jointly with the
identification task, thereby improving the accuracy of graph learning and
ensuring seamless integration between the two stages. Moreover, to capture
multi-scale event patterns, a dilated inception-based method is investigated to
perform feature extraction of PMU data. To test the proposed data-driven
approach, a large real-world dataset from tens of PMU sources and the
corresponding event logs have been utilized in this work. Numerical results
validate that our method has higher classification accuracy compared to

salvageable penumbra and irreversibly damaged core lesions. As such, it helps
clinicians to decide on the optimal reperfusion treatment. In perfusion CT
imaging, deconvolution methods are used to obtain clinically interpretable
perfusion parameters that allow identifying brain tissue abnormalities.
Deconvolution methods require the selection of two reference vascular functions
as inputs to the model: the arterial input function (AIF) and the venous output
function, with the AIF as the most critical model input. When manually
performed, the vascular function selection is time demanding, suffers from poor
reproducibility and is subject to the professionals' experience. This leads to
potentially unreliable quantification of the penumbra and core lesions and,
hence, might harm the treatment decision process. In this work we automatize
the perfusion analysis with AIFNet, a fully automatic and end-to-end trainable
deep learning approach for estimating the vascular functions. Unlike previous
methods using clustering or segmentation techniques to select vascular voxels,
AIFNet is directly optimized at the vascular function estimation, which allows
to better recognise the time-curve profiles. Validation on the public ISLES18
stroke database shows that AIFNet reaches inter-rater performance for the
vascular function estimation and, subsequently, for the parameter maps and core
lesion quantification obtained through deconvolution. We conclude that AIFNet
has potential for clinical transfer and could be incorporated in perfusion
deconvolution software.

  Training a Wide ReLU Network and a Deep Linear Network","Accepted at ICML 2021",,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Incorporating a so-called ""momentum"" dynamic in gradient descent methods is
widely used in neural net training as it has been broadly observed that, at
least empirically, it often leads to significantly faster convergence. At the
same time, there are very few theoretical guarantees in the literature to
explain this apparent acceleration effect. Even for the classical strongly
convex quadratic problems, several existing results only show Polyak's momentum
has an accelerated linear rate asymptotically. In this paper, we first revisit
the quadratic problems and show a non-asymptotic accelerated linear rate of
Polyak's momentum. Then, we provably show that Polyak's momentum achieves
acceleration for training a one-layer wide ReLU network and a deep linear
network, which are perhaps the two most popular canonical models for studying
optimization and deep learning in the literature. Prior work Du at al. 2019 and
Wu et al. 2019 showed that using vanilla gradient descent, and with an use of
over-parameterization, the error decays as $(1- \Theta(\frac{1}{ \kappa'}))^t$
after $t$ iterations, where $\kappa'$ is the condition number of a Gram Matrix.
Our result shows that with the appropriate choice of parameters Polyak's
momentum has a rate of $(1-\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\kappa'}}))^t$. For the deep
linear network, prior work Hu et al. 2020 showed that vanilla gradient descent
has a rate of $(1-\Theta(\frac{1}{\kappa}))^t$, where $\kappa$ is the condition
number of a data matrix. Our result shows an acceleration rate $(1-
\Theta(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\kappa}}))^t$ is achievable by Polyak's momentum. All the
results in this work are obtained from a modular analysis, which can be of
independent interest. This work establishes that momentum does indeed speed up
neural net training.

neutron-capture (""$r$-"") process, but can their integrated yields explain the
majority of heavy-element material in the Galaxy? One method to address this
question has utilized a forward approach that propagates NSM rates and yields
along with stellar formation rates, in the end comparing those results with
observed chemical abundances of $r$-process-rich, metal-poor stars. In this
work, we take the inverse approach by utilizing $r$-process-element abundance
ratios of metal-poor stars as input to reconstruct the properties---especially
the masses---of the neutron star (NS) binary progenitors of the $r$-process
stars. This novel analysis provides an independent avenue for studying the
population of the original neutron star binary systems that merged and produced
the $r$-process material incorporated in Galactic metal-poor halo stars. We use
ratios of elements typically associated with the limited-$r$ process and the
actinide region to those in the lanthanide region (i.e., Zr/Dy and Th/Dy) to
probe the NS masses of the progenitor merger. We find that NSMs can account for
all $r$-process material in metal-poor stars that display $r$-process
signatures, while simultaneously reproducing the present-day distribution of
double-NS (DNS) systems. However, the most $r$-process enhanced stars (the
$r$-II stars) on their own would require progenitor NSMs of very asymmetric
systems that are distinctly different from present ones in the Galaxy. As this
analysis is model-dependent, we also explore variations in line with future
expectation regarding potential theoretical and observational updates, and
comment on how these variations impact our results.

individual orthogonal projections for all views. The framework integrates the
correlations within multiple views, supervised discriminant capacity, and
distance preservation in a concise and compact way. It not only includes
several existing models as special cases, but also inspires new novel models.
To demonstrate its versatility to handle different learning scenarios, we
showcase three new multi-view discriminant analysis models and two new
multi-view multi-label classification ones under this framework. An efficient
numerical method based on successive approximations via eigenvectors is
presented to solve the associated optimization problem. The method is built
upon an iterative Krylov subspace method which can easily scale up for
high-dimensional datasets. Extensive experiments are conducted on various
real-world datasets for multi-view discriminant analysis and multi-view
multi-label classification. The experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed models are consistently competitive to and often better than the
compared methods that do not learn orthogonal projections.

  Distributed Linearly Separable Computation","33 pages, 2 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Communications",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies the distributed linearly separable computation problem,
which is a generalization of many existing distributed computing problems such
as distributed gradient descent and distributed linear transform. In this
problem, a master asks $N$ distributed workers to compute a linearly separable
function of $K$ datasets, which is a set of $K_c$ linear combinations of $K$
messages (each message is a function of one dataset). We assign some datasets
to each worker, which then computes the corresponding messages and returns some
function of these messages, such that from the answers of any $N_r$ out of $N$
workers the master can recover the task function. In the literature, the
specific case where $K_c = 1$ or where the computation cost is minimum has been
considered. In this paper, we focus on the general case (i.e., general $K_c$
and general computation cost) and aim to find the minimum communication cost.
We first propose a novel converse bound on the communication cost under the
constraint of the popular cyclic assignment (widely considered in the
literature), which assigns the datasets to the workers in a cyclic way.
Motivated by the observation that existing strategies for distributed computing
fall short of achieving the converse bound, we propose a novel distributed
computing scheme for some system parameters. The proposed computing scheme is
optimal for any assignment when $K_c$ is large and is optimal under cyclic
assignment when the numbers of workers and datasets are equal or $K_c$ is
small. In addition, it is order optimal within a factor of 2 under cyclic
assignment for the remaining cases.

conventional photonics. In particular the valley-Hall topological insulator has
been realized in a variety of photonic structures because it can be easily
induced by breaking certain lattice symmetries. However, the valley-Chern
numbers are usually fixed by design and the corresponding topological edge
states are forced to propagate in a fixed direction. Here, we propose a
mechanism to induce topological transitions via accidental Dirac points in
metasurfaces composed of interacting dipole emitters/antennas. For a fixed
arrangement of dipoles, we show that the topological phase depends critically
on the surrounding electromagnetic environment which mediates the dipole-dipole
interactions. To access different topological phases we embed the metasurface
inside a cavity waveguide where one can tune the dominant dipolar coupling from
short-range Coulomb interactions to long-range photon-mediated interactions by
reducing the cavity width; this results in a topological transition
characterized by an inversion of the valley-Chern numbers. Consequently, we
show that one can switch the chirality of the topological edge states by
modifying only the electromagnetic environment in which the dipoles are
embedded. This mechanism could have important implications for other
topological phases such as photonic higher-order topological insulators.

optimization. However, despite that over-parametrization is widely used
nowadays, little theory is available to explain the acceleration due to
over-parametrization. In this paper, we propose understanding it by studying a
simple problem first. Specifically, we consider the setting that there is a
single teacher neuron with quadratic activation, where over-parametrization is
realized by having multiple student neurons learn the data generated from the
teacher neuron. We provably show that over-parametrization helps the iterate
generated by gradient descent to enter the neighborhood of a global optimal
solution that achieves zero testing error faster. On the other hand, we also
point out an issue regarding the necessity of over-parametrization and study
how the scaling of the output neurons affects the convergence time.

Such restructuring of the flow manifests itself in a kink in magnetic-field

periodically updated, requiring LMTC models capable of zero-shot
generalization. Current state-of-the-art LMTC models employ Label-Wise
Attention Networks (LWANs), which (1) typically treat LMTC as flat multi-label
classification; (2) may use the label hierarchy to improve zero-shot learning,
although this practice is vastly understudied; and (3) have not been combined
with pre-trained Transformers (e.g. BERT), which have led to state-of-the-art
results in several NLP benchmarks. Here, for the first time, we empirically
evaluate a battery of LMTC methods from vanilla LWANs to hierarchical
classification approaches and transfer learning, on frequent, few, and
zero-shot learning on three datasets from different domains. We show that
hierarchical methods based on Probabilistic Label Trees (PLTs) outperform
LWANs. Furthermore, we show that Transformer-based approaches outperform the
state-of-the-art in two of the datasets, and we propose a new state-of-the-art
method which combines BERT with LWANs. Finally, we propose new models that
leverage the label hierarchy to improve few and zero-shot learning, considering
on each dataset a graph-aware annotation proximity measure that we introduce.

always been a methodological challenge and is an open problem. In this paper,
we propose a general probabilistic methodology for feature selection in joint
quantile time series analysis, under the name of quantile feature selection
time series (QFSTS) model. The QFSTS model is a general structural time series
model, where each component yields an additive contribution to the time series
modeling with direct interpretations. Its flexibility is compound in the sense
that users can add/deduct components for each times series and each time series
can have its own specific valued components of different sizes. Feature
selection is conducted in the quantile regression component, where each time
series has its own pool of contemporaneous external predictors allowing
""nowcasting"". Creative probabilistic methodology in extending feature selection
to the quantile time series research area is developed by means of multivariate
asymmetric Laplace distribution, ``spike-and-slab"" prior setup, the
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, and the Bayesian model averaging technique, all
implemented consistently in the Bayesian paradigm. Different from most machine
learning algorithms, the QFSTS model requires small datasets to train,
converges fast, and is executable on ordinary personal computers. Extensive
examinations on simulated data and empirical data confirmed that the QFSTS
model has superior performance in feature selection, parameter estimation, and
forecast.

sequence defined by a homogeneous linear recurrence relation with nonnegative
coefficients of the form $H_{n+1} = c_1 H_n + \cdots + c_L H_{n-L+1}$ and a
particular set of initial conditions.
  We seek to classify various PLRS's by completeness. With results on how
completeness is affected by modifying the recurrence coefficients of a PLRS, we
completely characterize completeness of several families of PLRS's as well as
conjecturing criteria for more general families. Our primary method is applying
Brown's criterion, which says that an increasing sequence $\{H_n\}_{n =
1}^{\infty}$ is complete if and only if $H_1 = 1$ and $H_{n + 1} \leq 1 +
\sum_{i = 1}^n H_i$.
  %A survey of these results can be found in \cite{BHLLMT}.
  Finally, we adopt previous analytic work on PLRS's to find a more efficient
way to check completeness. Specifically, the characteristic polynomial of any
PLRS has exactly one positive root; by bounding the size of this root, the
majority of sequences may be classified as complete or incomplete.
Additionally, we show there exists an indeterminate region where the principal
root does not reveal any information on completeness. We have conjectured
precise bounds for this region.

receptive field size as we go deeper into the encoder. The extra focus on
learning high level features causes the U-Net based approaches to learn less
information about low-level features which are crucial for detecting small

segmentation. We perform a detailed study of KiU-Net by performing experiments

evaluation (NDE) are important for ensuring the safe operation of high-risk
engineering structures. Recently, piezoresistive nanocomposite materials have
received much attention for SHM and NDE. These materials are self-sensing
because their electrical conductivity changes in response to deformation and
damage. Combined with electrical impedance tomography (EIT), it is possible to
map deleterious effects. However, EIT suffers from important limitations -- it
is computationally expensive, provides indistinct information on damage shape,
and can miss multiple damages if they are close together. In this article we
apply a novel neural network approach to quantify damage metrics such as size,
number, and location from EIT data. This network is trained using a simulation
routine calibrated to experimental data for a piezoresistive carbon
nanofiber-modified epoxy. Our results show that the network can predict the
number of damages with 99.2% accuracy, quantify damage size with respect to the
averaged radius at an average of 2.46% error, and quantify damage position with
respect to the domain length at an average of 0.89% error. These results are an
important first step in translating the combination of self-sensing materials
and EIT to real-world SHM and NDE.

Specifically, we focus on multimodal synthesis tasks in which the user intent

places distributions over abstract syntax trees conditioned on the NL input.

paper, we 1) clarify NSP's effect on BERT pre-training, 2) explore fourteen
possible auxiliary pre-training tasks, of which seven are novel to modern
language models, and 3) investigate different ways to include multiple tasks
into pre-training. We show that NSP is detrimental to training due to its
context splitting and shallow semantic signal. We also identify six auxiliary
pre-training tasks -- sentence ordering, adjacent sentence prediction, TF
prediction, TF-IDF prediction, a FastSent variant, and a Quick Thoughts variant
-- that outperform a pure MLM baseline. Finally, we demonstrate that using
multiple tasks in a multi-task pre-training framework provides better results
than using any single auxiliary task. Using these methods, we outperform BERT
Base on the GLUE benchmark using fewer than a quarter of the training tokens.

tends to be overconfident, sometimes even indicating high confidence in
presence of inaccurate predictions. Hence, the reliability of the prediction
and therefore reliable uncertainties are of highest interest. In this work, we
present a post processing method that for any given neural network provides
predictive uncertainty estimates and quality estimates. These estimates are
learned by a post processing model that receives as input a hand-crafted set of
transparent metrics in form of a structured dataset. Therefrom, we learn two
tasks for predicted bounding boxes. We discriminate between true positives
($\mathit{IoU}\geq0.5$) and false positives ($\mathit{IoU} < 0.5$) which we
term meta classification, and we predict $\mathit{IoU}$ values directly which
we term meta regression. The probabilities of the meta classification model aim
at learning the probabilities of success and failure and therefore provide a
modelled predictive uncertainty estimate. On the other hand, meta regression
gives rise to a quality estimate. In numerical experiments, we use the publicly
available YOLOv3 network and the Faster-RCNN network and evaluate meta
classification and regression performance on the Kitti, Pascal VOC and COCO
datasets. We demonstrate that our metrics are indeed well correlated with the
$\mathit{IoU}$. For meta classification we obtain classification accuracies of
up to 98.92% and AUROCs of up to 99.93%. For meta regression we obtain an $R^2$
value of up to 91.78%. These results yield significant improvements compared to
other network's objectness score and other baseline approaches. Therefore, we
obtain more reliable uncertainty and quality estimates which is particularly
interesting in the absence of ground truth.

loosened when $\xi$ is fitted together with other cosmological parameters, such

re-energized the debate over the astrophysical origins of the most massive
elements via the r-process nucleosynthesis. A key aspect of such studies is
comparing astronomical observations to theoretical nucleosynthesis yields in a
meaningful way. To perform realistic nucleosynthesis calculations,
understanding the uncertainty in microphysics details such as nuclear reaction
rates is as essential as understanding uncertainties in modeling the
astrophysical environment. We present an investigation of neutron capture rate
calculations' uncertainty away from stability using the Hauser-Feshbach model.
We provide a quantitative measure of the calculations' dependability when we
extrapolate models of statistical properties to nuclei in an r-process network.
We select several level density and gamma-ray strength models appropriate for
neutron-capture and use them to calculate the reaction rate for each nucleus in
the network. We observe how statistical properties affect the theoretical
reaction rates. The rates are then sampled with the Monte Carlo technique and
used in network calculations to map the range of possible r-process abundances.
The results show that neutron capture rates can vary by a couple of orders of
magnitude between calculations. Phenomenological models provide smoother
results than semi-microscopic. They cannot, however, reproduce nuclear
structure changes such as shell closures. While semi-microscopic models predict
nuclear structure effects away from stability, it is not clear that these
results are quantitatively accurate. The effect of the uncertainty on r-process
yields is large enough to impede comparisons between observation and
calculations. Progress in developing better microscopic models of gamma
strengths and level densities is urgently needed to improve the fidelity of
r-process models.

the effect of shock waves, whose presence in the stellar atmosphere distorts
the observational data and leads to systematic errors in the obtained

  This paper shows this is not the case. It presents an entirely automatic

techniques inspired by genetic programming with domain-specific knowledge to
effectively undermine plagiarism detectors. Mossad is effective at defeating
four plagiarism detectors, including Moss and JPlag. Mossad is both fast and
effective: it can, in minutes, generate modified versions of programs that are
likely to escape detection. More insidiously, because of its non-deterministic

are classified as no more suspicious than legitimate assignments. A detailed
study of Mossad across a corpus of real student assignments demonstrates its
efficacy at evading detection. A user study shows that graduate student

attention, particularly given its promise for downstream NLP tasks. However,
its true impact is limited and has not been well studied. Therefore, in this
paper, we explore the utility of NLI for one of the most prominent downstream
tasks, viz. Question Answering (QA). We transform the one of the largest
available MRC dataset (RACE) to an NLI form, and compare the performances of a
state-of-the-art model (RoBERTa) on both these forms. We propose new
characterizations of questions, and evaluate the performance of QA and NLI
models on these categories. We highlight clear categories for which the model
is able to perform better when the data is presented in a coherent entailment
form, and a structured question-answer concatenation form, respectively.

particle-like description, magnetic skyrmions can deform due to a self-induced
field. We perform Monte Carlo simulations to characterize the deformation of
the skyrmion during its movement}. In the low-velocity regime, the deformation
in the skyrmion shape is quantified by an effective inertial mass, which is
related to the dissipative force. When skyrmions move faster, the large
self-induced deformation triggers topological transitions. The transition is
characterized by the proliferation of skyrmions and different total topological
charge, which are obtained in terms of the skyrmion velocity. Our findings
provide an alternative way to describe the skyrmion dynamics that take into

introduces a novel motion correction (MC) algorithm for 3D DCE-US and assesses

pyramidal approach whereby short temporal windows consisting of 3-6 consecutive
frames are created to perform local registrations, which are then registered to
a master reference derived from a weighted average of all frames. We evaluated
the algorithm in 8 patients with metastatic lesions in the liver using the
Philips X6-1 matrix transducer at a frame rate of 1-3 Hz. We assessed
improvements in original vs. motion corrected 3D DCE-US cine using: i)
frame-to-frame volumetric overlap of segmented lesions, ii) normalized
correlation coefficient (NCC) between frames (similarity analysis), and iii)
sum of squared errors (SSE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and r-squared (R2)
quality-of-fit from fitted time-intensity curves (TIC) extracted from a
segmented lesion. Overall, results demonstrate significant decreases in 3D
DCE-US motion after applying the proposed algorithm. We noted significant
improvements in frame-to-frame lesion overlap across all patients, from 68%
without correction to 83% with motion correction (p = 0.023). Frame-to-frame

deep reinforcement learning technique, i.e., deep deterministic policy

to control its spike rate through different time-steps, enabling low-latency
and low-energy training from scratch. We conduct experiments on CIFAR-10,

(D3Net). D3Net involves a novel multi-dilated convolution that has different
dilation factors in a single layer to model different resolutions
simultaneously. By combining the multi-dilated convolution with DenseNet
architecture, D3Net avoids the aliasing problem that exists when we naively

However, we know that Earth's atmospheric composition changed significantly
through its geological evolution. Recent discoveries show that transiting,
potentially Earth-like exoplanets orbit a wide range of host stars, which
strongly influence their atmospheric composition and remotely detectable
spectra. Thus, a database for transiting terrestrial exoplanet around different
host stars at different geological times is a crucial missing ingredient to
support observational searches for signs of life in exoplanet atmospheres.
Here, we present the first high-resolution transmission spectra database for
Earth-like planets, orbiting a wide range of host stars, throughout four
representative stages of Earth's history. These correspond to a prebiotic high
CO2-world - about 3.9 billion years ago in Earth's history - and three epochs
through the rise of oxygen from 0.2% to modern atmospheric levels of 21%. We
demonstrate that the spectral biosignature pairs O2 + CH4 and O3 + CH4 in the
atmosphere of a transiting Earth-like planet would show a remote observer that
a biosphere exists for oxygen concentrations of about 1% modern Earth's -
corresponding to about 1 to 2 billion years ago in Earth's history - for all
host stars. The full model and high-resolution transmission spectra database,
covering 0.4 to 20microns, for transiting exoplanets - from young prebiotic
worlds to modern Earths-analogs - orbiting a wide range of host stars is
available online. It can be used as a tool to plan and optimize our observation
strategy, train retrieval methods, and interpret upcoming observations with
ground- and space-based telescopes.

lower than standard accuracy for any model. In this paper, we show this
direction is also promising. Firstly, we find even over-parameterized deep
networks may still have insufficient model capacity, because adversarial
training has an overwhelming smoothing effect. Secondly, given limited model
capacity, we argue adversarial data should have unequal importance:
geometrically speaking, a natural data point closer to/farther from the class
boundary is less/more robust, and the corresponding adversarial data point
should be assigned with larger/smaller weight. Finally, to implement the idea,
we propose geometry-aware instance-reweighted adversarial training, where the
weights are based on how difficult it is to attack a natural data point.

can be an arbitrary number of phases, is addressed using a consistent and
conservative volume distribution algorithm. The proposed algorithm satisfies
the summation constraint, the conservation constraint, and the
\textit{consistency of reduction}. The first application of the volume
distribution algorithm is to determine the Lagrange multipliers in multiphase
Phase-Field models that enforce the mass conservation, and a multiphase
conservative Allen-Cahn model that satisfies the \textit{consistency of
reduction} is developed. A corresponding consistent and conservative numerical
scheme is developed for the model. The multiphase conservative Allen-Cahn model
has a better ability than the multiphase Cahn-Hilliard model to preserve
under-resolved structures. The second application is to develop a numerical
procedure, called the boundedness mapping, to map the order parameters,
obtained numerically from a multiphase model, into their physical interval, and
at the same time to preserve the physical properties of the order parameters.
Along with the consistent and conservative schemes for the multiphase
Phase-Field models, the numerical solutions of the order parameters are
reduction consistent, conservative, and bounded, which are theoretically
analyzed and numerically validated. Then, the multiphase Phase-Field models are
coupled with the momentum equation by satisfying the \textit{consistency of

capturing the complicated multiphase dynamics even when there is a large

contextualised embedding models on the domain of the target task of interest.
Current self-supervised adaptation methods are simplistic, as the training
signal comes from a small percentage of \emph{randomly} masked-out tokens. In
this paper, we show that careful masking strategies can bridge the knowledge
gap of masked language models (MLMs) about the domains more effectively by
allocating self-supervision where it is needed. Furthermore, we propose an
effective training strategy by adversarially masking out those tokens which are
harder to reconstruct by the underlying MLM. The adversarial objective leads to
a challenging combinatorial optimisation problem over \emph{subsets} of tokens,
which we tackle efficiently through relaxation to a variational lowerbound and
dynamic programming. On six unsupervised domain adaptation tasks involving
named entity recognition, our method strongly outperforms the random masking

(PEs) on the torus. The space of analytic functions appears to be the natural
space to study the initial value problem for the inviscid PEs with general
initial data, as they have been recently shown to exhibit Kelvin-Helmholtz type
instability. First, for a short interval of time that is independent of the
rate of rotation $|\Omega|$, we establish the local well-posedness of the
inviscid PEs in the space of analytic functions. In addition, thanks to a fine
analysis of the barotropic and baroclinic modes decomposition, we establish two
results about the long time existence of solutions. (i) Independently of
$|\Omega|$, we show that the life-span of the solution tends to infinity as the
analytic norm of the initial baroclinic mode goes to zero. Moreover, we show in
this case that the solution of the $3D$ inviscid PEs converges to the solution
of the limit system, which is governed by the $2D$ Euler equations. (ii) We
show that the life-span of the solution can be prolonged unboundedly with
$|\Omega|\rightarrow \infty$, which is the main result of this paper. This is
established for ""well-prepared"" initial data, namely, when only the Sobolev
norm (but not the analytic norm) of the baroclinic mode is small enough,
depending on $|\Omega|$. Furthermore, for large $|\Omega|$ and ""well-prepared""
initial data, we show that the solution to the $3D$ inviscid PEs is
approximated by the solution to a simple limit resonant system with the same
initial data.

main-sequence (MS), and green valley (GV) galaxies. In this paper, we present
the sample selection and characteristics of the ALMA observations, and showcase
some of the key results enabled by the combination of spatially-matched stellar
populations and gas measurements. Considering the global (aperture-matched)
stellar mass, molecular gas mass, and star formation rate of the sample, we
find that the sSFR depends on both the star formation efficiency (SFE) and the
molecular gas fraction ($f_{\rm H_{2}}$), although the correlation with the
latter is slightly weaker. Furthermore, the dependence of sSFR on the molecular
gas content (SFE or $f_{\rm H_{2}}$) is stronger than that on either the atomic
gas fraction or the molecular-to-atomic gas fraction, albeit with the small HI
sample size. On kpc scales, the variations in both SFE and $f_{\rm H_{2}}$
within individual galaxies can be as large as 1-2 dex thereby demonstrating
that the availability of spatially-resolved observations is essential to
understand the details of both star formation and quenching processes.

policies---policies that only consider the last observation when selecting
actions. Learning memoryless policies is efficient and optimal in fully
observable environments. However, some form of memory is necessary when RL
agents are faced with partial observability. In this paper, we study a
lightweight approach to tackle partial observability in RL. We provide the
agent with an external memory and additional actions to control what, if
anything, is written to the memory. At every step, the current memory state is
part of the agent's observation, and the agent selects a tuple of actions: one
action that modifies the environment and another that modifies the memory. When
the external memory is sufficiently expressive, optimal memoryless policies
yield globally optimal solutions. Unfortunately, previous attempts to use
external memory in the form of binary memory have produced poor results in
practice. Here, we investigate alternative forms of memory in support of
learning effective memoryless policies. Our novel forms of memory outperform
binary and LSTM-based memory in well-established partially observable domains.

rides per vehicle (optimally) or three (with heuristics). In this paper, we
present a dynamic, demand aware, and pricing-based vehicle-passenger matching
and route planning framework that (1) dynamically generates optimal routes for
each vehicle based on online demand, pricing associated with each ride, vehicle
capacities and locations. This matching algorithm starts greedily and optimizes
over time using an insertion operation, (2) involves drivers in the
decision-making process by allowing them to propose a different price based on
the expected reward for a particular ride as well as the destination locations
for future rides, which is influenced by supply-and demand computed by the Deep
Q-network, (3) allows customers to accept or reject rides based on their set of
preferences with respect to pricing and delay windows, vehicle type and
carpooling preferences, and (4) based on demand prediction, our approach
re-balances idle vehicles by dispatching them to the areas of anticipated high
demand using deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our framework is validated using
the New York City Taxi public dataset; however, we consider different vehicle
types and designed customer utility functions to validate the setup and study
different settings. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach

other current techniques. However, the current methods depend usually on
setting manually serval threshold values and parameters which make the

resulting estimators may suffer from high variance. Our approach is based on
training a classifier that provides the probability that a data sample pair is

synthesize photo-realistic images, it is often very slow to converge to

successful variance-reduction techniques is path guiding, which can learn
better distributions for importance sampling to reduce pixel noise. However,
previous methods require a large number of path samples to achieve reliable
path guiding. We present a novel neural path guiding approach that can
reconstruct high-quality sampling distributions for path guiding from a sparse
set of samples, using an offline trained neural network. We leverage photons
traced from light sources as the input for sampling density reconstruction,
which is highly effective for challenging scenes with strong global
illumination. To fully make use of our deep neural network, we partition the
scene space into an adaptive hierarchical grid, in which we apply our network
to reconstruct high-quality sampling distributions for any local region in the
scene. This allows for highly efficient path guiding for any path bounce at any
location in path tracing. We demonstrate that our photon-driven neural path
guiding method can generalize well on diverse challenging testing scenes that
are not seen in training. Our approach achieves significantly better rendering
results of testing scenes than previous state-of-the-art path guiding methods.

seen in electrical resistivity and seebeck coefficient measurements. The
seebeck coefficient shows a large change of about 10-13 $\mu$V/K with time
constant of ~20 sec, at room temperature (300 K) when the gas ambience changes
from 100% oxygen to 100% nitrogen and vice versa, under a constant temperature
gradient of 1 K. The response in seebeck is found to be particularly large
below MIT. The diffusion of oxygen into the lattice leading to hole doping
shows a large change in carrier concentration resulting in a large change in
the seebeck coefficient in insulating state. On the other hand, due to
insignificant increase in already large carrier concentration in metallic state
the change in seebeck is minimal. Nevertheless, below MIT the response is
fairly reproducible within stoichiometry ${\delta}$ = 0.5 $\pm$ 0.05. This
principle shall be of significant utility to design the oxygen sensors which

date, it is however still challenging to compare fuzzers due to the
inconsistency of the benchmarks, performance metrics, and/or environments for
evaluation, which buries the useful insights and thus impedes the discovery of
promising fuzzing primitives. In this paper, we design and develop UNIFUZZ, an
open-source and metrics-driven platform for assessing fuzzers in a
comprehensive and quantitative manner. Specifically, UNIFUZZ to date has
incorporated 35 usable fuzzers, a benchmark of 20 real-world programs, and six
categories of performance metrics. We first systematically study the usability
of existing fuzzers, find and fix a number of flaws, and integrate them into

metrics to evaluate fuzzers from six complementary perspectives. Using UNIFUZZ,
we conduct in-depth evaluations of several prominent fuzzers including AFL [1],
AFLFast [2], Angora [3], Honggfuzz [4], MOPT [5], QSYM [6], T-Fuzz [7] and
VUzzer64 [8]. We find that none of them outperforms the others across all the
target programs, and that using a single metric to assess the performance of a
fuzzer may lead to unilateral conclusions, which demonstrates the significance
of comprehensive metrics. Moreover, we identify and investigate previously
overlooked factors that may significantly affect a fuzzer's performance,
including instrumentation methods and crash analysis tools. Our empirical
results show that they are critical to the evaluation of a fuzzer. We hope that
our findings can shed light on reliable fuzzing evaluation, so that we can
discover promising fuzzing primitives to effectively facilitate fuzzer designs

direction similarly, meanwhile several directions are not useful for the
discriminative task. To improve the discrepancy and consequently the relational
regularization, we propose a new relational discrepancy, named spherical sliced
fused Gromov Wasserstein (SSFG), that can find an important area of projections
characterized by a von Mises-Fisher distribution. Then, we introduce two
variants of SSFG to improve its performance. The first variant, named mixture
spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (MSSFG), replaces the vMF
distribution by a mixture of von Mises-Fisher distributions to capture multiple
important areas of directions that are far from each other. The second variant,
named power spherical sliced fused Gromov Wasserstein (PSSFG), replaces the vMF
distribution by a power spherical distribution to improve the sampling time in
high dimension settings. We then apply the new discrepancies to the RAE
framework to achieve its new variants. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments to show that the new proposed autoencoders have favorable

model toward an identity mapping. Our method identifies and discards
unimportant non-linear mappings in the residual connections by applying a
thresholding operator on the function norm. It is applicable to any structured
module, including a single attention head, an entire attention block, or a
feed-forward subnetwork. Furthermore, we introduce spectral normalization to
stabilize the distribution of the post-activation values of the Transformer
layers, further improving the pruning effectiveness of the proposed
methodology. We conduct experiments with BERT on 5 GLUE benchmark tasks to
demonstrate that SNIP achieves effective pruning results while maintaining
comparable performance. Specifically, we improve the performance over the
state-of-the-art by 0.5 to 1.0% on average at 50% compression ratio.

  Learning Low-Latency Spiking Neural Networks","The first two authors contributed equally to this paper",,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative to traditional
deep learning frameworks, since they provide higher computational efficiency
due to event-driven information processing. SNNs distribute the analog values
of pixel intensities into binary spikes over time. However, the most widely
used input coding schemes, such as Poisson based rate-coding, do not leverage
the additional temporal learning capability of SNNs effectively. Moreover,
these SNNs suffer from high inference latency which is a major bottleneck to
their deployment. To overcome this, we propose a scalable time-based encoding
scheme that utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to reduce the number
of timesteps required for inference. DCT decomposes an image into a weighted
sum of sinusoidal basis images. At each time step, the Hadamard product of the
DCT coefficients and a single frequency base, taken in order, is given to an
accumulator that generates spikes upon crossing a threshold. We use the
proposed scheme to learn DCT-SNN, a low-latency deep SNN with
leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons, trained using surrogate gradient descent
based backpropagation. We achieve top-1 accuracy of 89.94%, 68.3% and 52.43% on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively using VGG architectures.
Notably, DCT-SNN performs inference with 2-14X reduced latency compared to
other state-of-the-art SNNs, while achieving comparable accuracy to their
standard deep learning counterparts. The dimension of the transform allows us
to control the number of timesteps required for inference. Additionally, we can
trade-off accuracy with latency in a principled manner by dropping the highest
frequency components during inference.

anisotropy indices and hardnesses of NaInS2-xSex have been investigated as Se

has been confirmed. The ratio of shear to bulk modulus (G/B) is low suggesting
that the NaInS2-xSex (x = 0.5 and 1.5) compounds exhibit damage tolerant
(ductility) properties while rest of the compositions are brittle in nature.
The predicted hardness (H) values are also influenced with the Se content in
the following order: H (NaInSSe) > H (NaInS2) > H (NaInSe2) > H (NaInS1.5Se0.5)
> H (NaInS0.5Se1.5). All the anisotropic indices under study indicate that
NaInS2-xSex compounds are anisotropic in nature. The Mulliken bond population
analysis suggests that the degree of covalency of In-S/Se bonds decreases when
S is substituted by Se. The origin of low Debye temperature ({\Theta}D) and low
minimum thermal conductivity (Kmin) have been successfully explained by
considering the mean atomic weight (M/n) and average bond strength of the
compounds. Temperature dependence of heat capacities (Cv, Cp) and linear
thermal expansion coefficient ({\alpha} ) are also estimated using the
quasi-harmonic Debye model and discussed. The low values of Kmin, {\Theta}D and
{\alpha} and damage tolerant behavior clearly indicate that the NaInS2-xSex (x

If $f$ is $G$-Lipschitz, then the classic gradient descent algorithm solves

complexity that is still independent of the dimension $n$.
  In this paper we reprove the randomized lower bound of

  Bidirectional Rearrangement with Progressive Step Learning","Paper accepted in WACV 2021",,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Image outpainting is a very intriguing problem as the outside of a given
image can be continuously filled by considering as the context of the image.
This task has two main challenges. The first is to maintain the spatial
consistency in contents of generated regions and the original input. The second
is to generate a high-quality large image with a small amount of adjacent
information. Conventional image outpainting methods generate inconsistent,
blurry, and repeated pixels. To alleviate the difficulty of an outpainting
problem, we propose a novel image outpainting method using bidirectional
boundary region rearrangement. We rearrange the image to benefit from the image
inpainting task by reflecting more directional information. The bidirectional
boundary region rearrangement enables the generation of the missing region
using bidirectional information similar to that of the image inpainting task,
thereby generating the higher quality than the conventional methods using
unidirectional information. Moreover, we use the edge map generator that
considers images as original input with structural information and hallucinates
the edges of unknown regions to generate the image. Our proposed method is
compared with other state-of-the-art outpainting and inpainting methods both
qualitatively and quantitatively. We further compared and evaluated them using
BRISQUE, one of the No-Reference image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, to
evaluate the naturalness of the output. The experimental results demonstrate
that our method outperforms other methods and generates new images with
360{\deg}panoramic characteristics.

spin-2 system, the relative entropy of coherence and the quantum mutual

to the explicit identification of novel orderings of spin quadrupole moments
with zero magnetic moments in the whole parameter space. We find the three
uniaxial spin nematic quadrupole phases for the spin-1 system and the two
biaxial spin nematic phases for the spin-2 system. For the spin-2 system, the
two orthogonal biaxial spin nematic states are connected adiabatically without
an explicit phase transition, which can be called quantum crossover. The
quantum crossover region is estimated by using the quantum fidelity. Whereas
for the spin-1 system, the two discontinuous quantum phase transitions occur
between three distinct uniaxial spin nematic phases. We discuss the quantum

mechanical evolution in highly scattering solids, is examined in a laboratory

quasi-statically fractured in the three-point-bending (3PB) configuration,
while ultrasonic shear waves are periodically generated in the sample at
certain time steps $t_\kappa$, $\kappa = \circ, 1, 2, ..., 4$. The interaction
of probing waves with the propagating damage give rise to transient velocity
responses measured on the plate's boundary by a 3D scanning laser Doppler
vibrometer. Thus obtained sensory data are then carefully processed to retrieve
the associated spectra of scattered displacement fields $v^\kappa$ at every
$t_\kappa$. On deploying consecutive pairs of multi-frequency data $(v^\kappa,
v^{\kappa+1})$, the differential indicators are computed exposing the progress
of 3PB-induced damage in the specimen. Verified with in-situ observations, each
indicator map successfully reconstructs (a) the support of newborn fractures,
and (b) the loci of discontinuities in the process zone that undergo
interfacial evolution in the designated timeframe $[t_\kappa \,\,\,

understand the damage mechanism e.g., by shining light on the fragmented nature
of induced cracks and their coalescence. For completeness, data inversion via
reduced and partial-aperture data is investigated, including the one-sided

However, many previous systems only detect the onset and offset of notes
frame-wise, so the transcription resolution is limited to the frame hop size.
There is a lack of research on using different strategies to encode onset and
offset targets for training. In addition, previous AMT systems are sensitive to
the misaligned onset and offset labels of audio recordings. Furthermore, there
are limited researches on sustain pedal transcription on large-scale datasets.
In this article, we propose a high-resolution AMT system trained by regressing
precise onset and offset times of piano notes. At inference, we propose an

A very good agreement has been found between our results with the available

nature as confirmed from the electronic band structure and optical
properties.The strong hybridizations among s orbitals of Na, In and Se atoms
push the bottom of the conduction band downward resulting in a narrower band
gap of NaInSe2 compared to that of NaInS2 compound. Different optical
(dielectric function, photoconductivity, absorption coefficient, reflectivity,
refractive index and loss function) and thermoelectric (Seebeck coefficient,
electrical conductivity, power factor and thermal conductivity) properties of
NaInX2 (X = S, Se) have been studied in detail for the first time. It is found
that all these properties are significantly anisotropic due to the strongly
layered structure of NaInX2 (X = S, Se). Strong optical absorption with sharp
peaks is found in the far visible to mid ultraviolet (UV) regions while the
reflectivity is low in the UV region for both the compounds. Such features
indicate feasibility of applications in optoelectronic sector.The calculated
thermoelectric power factors at 1000 K for NaInS2 and NaInSe2 along a-axis are

of likelihood-based generative models in unsupervised learning. The
likelihood-based generative models have been reported to be highly robust to
the out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs and can be a detector by assuming that the
model assigns higher likelihoods to the samples from the in-distribution (ID)
dataset than an OOD dataset. However, recent works reported a phenomenon that
VAE recognizes some OOD samples as ID by assigning a higher likelihood to the
OOD inputs compared to the one from ID. In this work, we introduce a new model,
namely Bigeminal Priors Variational auto-encoder (BPVAE), to address this
phenomenon. The BPVAE aims to enhance the robustness of the VAEs by combing the
power of VAE with the two independent priors that belong to the training
dataset and simple dataset, which complexity is lower than the training
dataset, respectively. BPVAE learns two datasets'features, assigning a higher
likelihood for the training dataset than the simple dataset. In this way, we
can use BPVAE's density estimate for detecting the OOD samples. Quantitative
experimental results suggest that our model has better generalization
capability and stronger robustness than the standard VAEs, proving the
effectiveness of the proposed approach of hybrid learning by collaborative
priors. Overall, this work paves a new avenue to potentially overcome the OOD
problem via multiple latent priors modeling.

a few classes (called majority classes) constitute much more data samples than
the rest (called minority classes). Learning deep neural networks using such
datasets leads to performances that are typically biased towards the majority
classes. Most of the prior works try to solve class-imbalance by assigning more
weights to the minority classes in various manners (e.g., data re-sampling,
cost-sensitive learning). However, we argue that the number of available
training data may not be always a good clue to determine the weighting strategy
because some of the minority classes might be sufficiently represented even by
a small number of training data. Overweighting samples of such classes can lead
to drop in the model's overall performance. We claim that the 'difficulty' of a
class as perceived by the model is more important to determine the weighting.
In this light, we propose a novel loss function named Class-wise
Difficulty-Balanced loss, or CDB loss, which dynamically distributes weights to
each sample according to the difficulty of the class that the sample belongs
to. Note that the assigned weights dynamically change as the 'difficulty' for
the model may change with the learning progress. Extensive experiments are
conducted on both image (artificially induced class-imbalanced MNIST,
long-tailed CIFAR and ImageNet-LT) and video (EGTEA) datasets. The results show
that CDB loss consistently outperforms the recently proposed loss functions on
class-imbalanced datasets irrespective of the data type (i.e., video or image).

inconsistent with simple tangling of magnetic fields, but consistent with SSD
action, reproducing and confirming models by Balsara et al. (2004) that did not
include physical resistivity $\eta$. We vary $\eta$, as well as the numerical
resolution and supernova rate, $\dot\sigma$, to delineate the regime in which
an SSD occurs. For a given $\dot\sigma$ we find convergence for SSD growth rate
with resolution of a parsec. For $\dot\sigma\simeq\dot\sigma_{\rm sn}$, with
$\dot\sigma_{\rm sn}$ the solar neighbourhood rate, the critical resistivity

producing thermomechanically controlled processed (TMCP) heavy plates made of
steel. In order to adjust the complex microstructure of the underlying
material, the Leidenfrost behavior of the hot surfaces with respect to the
application of the cooling fluid has to be studied. Since the heat fluxes
depend on the enthalpy and hence on the solution of the underlying initial
boundary value problem (IBVP), the parameter-to-solution operator, and thus the
forward operator of the inverse problem, can only be defined implicitly. To
guarantee well-defined operators, we study two approaches for showing existence
and uniqueness of solutions of the IBVP. One approach deals with the theory of
pseudomonotone operators and so-called strong solutions in Sobolev-Bochner
spaces. The other theory uses classical solutions in H\""older spaces. Whereas
the first approach yields a solution under milder assumptions, it fails to show
the uniqueness result in contrast to the second approach. Furthermore, we
propose a convenient parametrization approach for the nonlinear heat fluxes in
order to decouple the parameter-to-solution relation and use an iterative
solver based on a Projected Quasi-Newton (PQN) method together with
box-constraints to solve the inverse problem. For numerical experiments, we
derive the necessary gradient information of the objective functional and use
the discrepancy principle as a stopping rule. Numerical tests show that the PQN

Depth-wise Layering is a kind of segmentation that slices an image in a

The technique employs a thresholding approach to segment rows of the dense

uses the line-segment labelling method to identify number of objects and layers

set, still remains Lipschitz and accessible via FO. In particular, we introduce
MOPES method, which carefully combines Moreau-Yosida smoothing and accelerated
first-order schemes. This is guaranteed to find a feasible
$\epsilon$-suboptimal solution using only $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ PO calls and
optimal $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ FO calls. Further, instead of a PO if we only have a
linear minimization oracle (LMO, a la Frank-Wolfe) to access the constraint
set, an extension of our method, MOLES, finds a feasible $\epsilon$-suboptimal
solution using $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ LMO calls and FO calls---both match known
lower bounds, resolving a question left open since White (1993). Our
experiments confirm that these methods achieve significant speedups over the
state-of-the-art, for a problem with costly PO and LMO calls.

the estimation of the residual correlation of FCCR by the second-order

our analysis applies to a broad class of input distributions with almost surely
full-rank feature matrices, which allows us to cover various types of

for analytic (random) feature maps. Using this theory, we can show that our

hyperparameter inferring the underlying distribution of an identically and
independently distributed finite random variable. For this we embed both the
Bayesian hyper-parameter updating process and the random data process into a
Markov chain. The original publication by Bertschinger et al. (2006) mentioned
that NTIC may be able to capture an abstract notion of modeling that is
agnostic to the specific internal structure of and existence of explicit
representations within the modeling process. The Bayesian hyperparameter is of
interest since it has a well defined interpretation as a model of the data
process and at the same time its dynamics can be specified without reference to
this interpretation. On the one hand we show explicitly that the NTIC of the
hyperparameter increases indefinitely over time. On the other hand we attempt
to establish a connection between a quantity that is a feature of the
interpretation of the hyperparameter as a model, namely the information gain,
and the one-step pointwise NTIC which is a quantity that does not depend on
this interpretation. We find that in general we cannot use the one-step
pointwise NTIC as an indicator for information gain. We hope this exploratory
work can lead to further rigorous studies of the relation between NTIC and

way to address incompatible environments, because they can process graphs of
arbitrary size. They also allow practitioners to inject biases encoded in the
structure of the input graph. Existing work in graph-based continuous control
uses the physical morphology of the agent to construct the input graph, i.e.,
encoding limb features as node labels and using edges to connect the nodes if
their corresponded limbs are physically connected. In this work, we present a
series of ablations on existing methods that show that morphological
information encoded in the graph does not improve their performance. Motivated
by the hypothesis that any benefits GNNs extract from the graph structure are
outweighed by difficulties they create for message passing, we also propose
Amorpheus, a transformer-based approach. Further results show that, while
Amorpheus ignores the morphological information that GNNs encode, it
nonetheless substantially outperforms GNN-based methods that use the
morphological information to define the message-passing scheme.

characterised by just two numbers: their mass and spin. The gravitational-wave
emission from a perturbed black-hole consists of a superposition of damped
sinusoids, known as \textit{quasi-normal modes}. Quasi-normal modes are
specified by three integers $(\ell,m,n)$: the $(\ell, m)$ integers describe the
angular properties and $(n)$ specifies the (over)tone. If the no-hair theorem
holds, the frequencies and damping times of quasi-normal modes are determined
uniquely by the mass and spin of the black hole, while phases and amplitudes
depend on the particular perturbation. Current tests of the no-hair theorem,
attempt to identify these modes in a semi-agnostic way, without imposing priors
on the source of the perturbation. This is usually known as \textit{black-hole
spectroscopy}. Applying this framework to GW150914, the measurement of the
first overtone led to the confirmation of the theorem to $20\%$ level. We show,
however, that such semi-agnostic tests cannot provide strong evidence in favour
of the no-hair theorem, even for extremely loud signals, given the increasing
number of overtones (and free parameters) needed to fit the data. This can be
solved by imposing prior assumptions on the origin of the perturbed black hole
that can further constrain the explored parameters: in particular, our
knowledge that the ringdown is sourced by a binary black hole merger. Applying
this strategy to GW150914 we find a natural log Bayes factor of $\sim 6.5$ in
favour of the Kerr nature of its remnant, indicating that the hairy object
hypothesis is disfavoured with $<1:600$ with respect to the Kerr black-hole
one.

model on a three-dimensional cubic lattice in a weak coupling regime. It is
known that, at half-filling, the ground state of this model is
antiferromagnetic (commensurate spin-density wave). For non-zero doping,
various types of spatially inhomogeneous phases, such as phase-separated states
and the state with domain walls (""soliton lattice""), can emerge. Using the
mean-field theory, we evaluate the free energies of these phases to determine
which of them could become the true ground state in the limit of small doping.
Our study demonstrates that the free energies of all discussed states are very
close to each other. Smallness of these energy differences suggests that, for a
real material, numerous factors, unaccounted by the model, may arbitrary shift
the relative stability of the competing phases. This further implies that
purely theoretical prediction of the true ground state in a particular
many-fermion system is unreliable.

  Adaptive Time-Varying Parameters",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real-world phenomena that can be formulated as signals are often affected by
a number of factors and appear as multi-component modes. To understand and
process such phenomena, ""divide-and-conquer"" is probably the most common
strategy to address the problem. In other words, the captured signal is
decomposed into signal components for each individual component to be
processed. Unfortunately, for signals that are superimposition of
non-stationary amplitude-frequency modulated (AM-FM) components, the
""divide-and-conquer"" strategy is bound to fail, since there is no way to be
sure that the decomposed components take on the AM-FM formulations which are
necessary for the extraction of their instantaneous frequencies (IFs) and
amplitudes (IAs). In this paper, we propose an adaptive signal separation
operation (ASSO) for effective and accurate separation of a single-channel
blind-source multi-component signal, via introducing a time-varying parameter
that adapts locally to IFs and using linear chirp (linear frequency modulation)
signals to approximate components at each time instant. We derive more accurate
component recovery formulae based on the linear chirp signal local
approximation. In addition, a recovery scheme, together with a ridge detection
method, is also proposed to extract the signal components one by one, and the
time-varying parameter is updated for each component. The proposed method is
suitable for engineering implementation, being capable of separating
complicated signals into their components or sub-signals and reconstructing the
signal trend directly. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world
signals are presented to demonstrate our improvement over the previous
attempts.

transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of a vaccine, calls for active
containment measures to avoid the propagation of transmission chains. The best
strategy up to date, popularly known as Test-Track-Treat (TTT), consist in
testing the population for diagnosis, track the contacts of those infected, and
treat by quarantine all these cases. The dynamical process that better
describes the combined action of the former mechanisms is that of a contagion
process that competes with the spread of the pathogen, cutting off potential
contagion pathways. Here we propose a compartmental model that couples the
dynamics of the infection with the contact tracing and isolation of cases. We
develop an analytical expression for the effective case reproduction number
$R_c(t)$ that reveals the role of contact tracing in the mitigation and
suppression of the epidemics. We show that there is a trade off between the
infection propagation and the isolation of cases. If the isolation is limited
to symptomatic individuals only, the incidence curve can be flattened but not
bended. However, if contact tracing is applied to asymptomatic individuals too,
the strategy can bend the curve and suppress the epidemics. Quantitative
results are dependent on the network topology. We quantify, the most important
indicator of the effectiveness of contact tracing, namely its capacity to
reverse the increasing tendency of the epidemic curve, causing its bending.

camera poses (6 DOF) estimated by VO or V-SLAM. One drawback of this approach,
besides the redundancy in estimating full 6 DOF camera poses, is the dependency
on estimating a map (3D scene points) jointly with the 6 DOF poses due to the
basic constraint on structure-and-motion. To simplify the task of absolute
orientation estimation, we formulate the monocular rotational odometry problem
and devise a fast algorithm to accurately estimate camera orientations with
2D-2D feature matches alone. Underpinning our system is a new incremental
rotation averaging method for fast and constant time iterative updating.
Furthermore, our system maintains a view-graph that 1) allows solving loop
closure to remove camera orientation drift, and 2) can be used to warm start a
V-SLAM system. We conduct extensive quantitative experiments on real-world
datasets to demonstrate the accuracy of our incremental camera orientation

the known rotation problem to estimate the trajectory of the camera and the
surrounding map, and 2)enabling V-SLAM systems to track pure rotational
motions.

proposed. Among them, some consider using pairwise but not pointwise labels,

security reasons. However, as a pairwise label denotes whether or not two data
points share a pointwise label, it cannot be easily collected if either point
is equally likely to be positive or negative. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
novel setting called pairwise comparison (Pcomp) classification, where we have
only pairs of unlabeled data that we know one is more likely to be positive
than the other. Firstly, we give a Pcomp data generation process, derive an
unbiased risk estimator (URE) with theoretical guarantee, and further improve
URE using correction functions. Secondly, we link Pcomp classification to
noisy-label learning to develop a progressive URE and improve it by imposing
consistency regularization. Finally, we demonstrate by experiments the
effectiveness of our methods, which suggests Pcomp is a valuable and
practically useful type of pairwise supervision besides the pairwise label.

solar flares, but also galactic events when they come from outside our solar
system. SEPs are correlated with the 11-year solar cycle while GCRs are
anti-correlated due to their interaction with the heliospheric magnetic field
and the solar wind. Our aim is to quantify separately the impact of the
amplitude and the geometry of the magnetic field on the propagation of CRs of
various energies in the inner heliosphere. We focus especially on the diffusion
caused by the magnetic field along and across the field lines. To do so, we use
the results of 3D MHD wind simulations running from the lower corona up to 1
AU. The wind is modeled using a polytropic approximation, and fits and power
laws are used to account for the turbulence. Using these results, we compute
the parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients of the Parker CR
transport equation, yielding 3D maps of the diffusion of CRs in the inner
heliosphere. By varying the amplitude of the magnetic field, we change the
amplitude of the diffusion by the same factor, and the radial gradients by
changing the spread of the current sheet. By varying the geometry of the
magnetic field, we change the latitudinal gradients of diffusion by changing
the position of the current sheets. By varying the energy, we show that the
distribution of values for SEPs is more peaked than GCRs. For realistic solar
configurations, we show that diffusion is highly non-axisymmetric due to the
configuration of the current sheets, and that the distribution varies a lot
with the distance to the Sun with a drift of the peak value. This study shows
that numerical simulations and theory can help quantify better the influence of
the various magnetic field parameters on the propagation of CRs. This study is
a first step towards generating synthetic CR rates from numerical simulations.

model to estimate the segment-wise Intersection over Union (IoU) of each
predicted segment of unlabeled images. This can be understood as an estimation
of segment-wise prediction quality. Queried regions are supposed to minimize to
competing targets, i.e., low predicted IoU values / segmentation quality and
low estimated annotation costs. For estimating the latter we propose a simple
but practical method for annotation cost estimation. We compare our method to
entropy based methods, where we consider the entropy as uncertainty of the
prediction. The comparison and analysis of the results provide insights into
annotation costs as well as robustness and variance of the methods. Numerical
experiments conducted with two different networks on the Cityscapes dataset
clearly demonstrate a reduction of annotation effort compared to random
acquisition. Noteworthily, we achieve 95%of the mean Intersection over Union
(mIoU), using MetaBox+ compared to when training with the full dataset, with
only 10.47% / 32.01% annotation effort for the two networks, respectively.

approach for reducing thermal noise is to cool the mirrors. There are many
technical challenges that must be overcome to cool the mirrors, such as
cryocooler induced vibrations, thermal drift in suspensions, and reduction in
duty cycling due to the increased number of potential failure mechanisms. Our
mirror suspension has a black coating that makes radiative cooling more
efficient. For conduction cooling, we developed ultra high purity aluminum heat
links, which yield high thermal conductivity while keeping the spring constant
sufficiently small. A unique inclination adjustment system, called moving mass,
is used for aligning the mirror orientation in pitch. Photo-reflective
displacement sensors, which have a large range, are installed for damping
control on marionette recoil mass and intermediate recoil mass. Samarium cobalt
magnets are used for coil-magnet actuators to prevent significant change of
magnetism between room temperature and cryogenic temperature. In this paper,

the probability that a valid Cuckoo assignment fails to exist). It has since
become a standard technique in areas such as cryptography, where a negligible
probability of failure is often required. We focus on an extension of Cuckoo
hashing that allows multiple items per bucket, which improves the load factor.
That extension was also analyzed by Kirsch \emph{et al.} in the presence of a
stash. In particular, letting $d$ be the number of items per bucket, and $s$ be
the stash size, Kirsch \emph{et al.} showed that, for constant $d$ and $s$, the
failure probability is $\mathcal{O}(n^{(s+1)(1-d)})$. In this paper, we first
report a bug in the analysis by Kirsch \emph{et al.} by showing a
counter-example leading to an asymptotically-larger probability of failure
$\Omega(n^{-d-s-1})$. Then we provide a general analysis and upper bound of the
failure probability for (almost) arbitrary $d$ and $s$, instead of just
constant, which is useful for applications in cryptography. We finally deduce
from the general analysis a tight bound $\Theta(n^{-d-s})$ for the probability
of failure, for constants $d$ and $s$.

efficient and cost-effective algorithm for tracking the scene and the patient
to interactively assist the patient's positioning process by providing visual
feedback to the operator. Up to our knowledge, this is the first framework that
can be employed for mobile interactive AR to guide patient positioning.
METHODS: We propose a point cloud processing method that combined with a
fiducial marker-mapper algorithm and the generalized ICP algorithm tracks the
patient and the camera precisely and efficiently only using the CPU unit. The
alignment between the 3D reference model and body marker map is calculated
employing an efficient body reconstruction algorithm. RESULTS: Our quantitative
evaluation shows that the proposed method achieves a translational and
rotational error of 4.17 mm/0.82 deg at 9 fps. Furthermore, the qualitative
results demonstrate the usefulness of our algorithm in patient positioning on
different human subjects. CONCLUSION: Since our algorithm achieves a relatively
high frame rate and accuracy employing a regular laptop (without the usage of a
dedicated GPU), it is a very cost-effective AR-based patient positioning
method. It also opens the way for other researchers by introducing a framework
that could be improved upon for better mobile interactive AR patient

it generated a diffused societal debate. The online version of this discussion
was not exempted by the presence of d/misinformation campaigns, but differently
from what already witnessed in other debates, the COVID-19 -- intentional or

the effectiveness of governments' countermeasures. In the present manuscript,
we study the effective impact of misinformation in the Italian societal debate

In order to extract the discursive communities, we focus on verified users,
i.e. accounts whose identity is officially certified by Twitter. We thus infer
the various discursive communities based on how verified users are perceived by
standard ones: if two verified accounts are considered as similar by non
unverified ones, we link them in the network of certified accounts. We first
observe that, beside being a mostly scientific subject, the COVID-19 discussion
show a clear division in what results to be different political groups. At this
point, by using a commonly available fact-checking software (NewsGuard), we
assess the reputation of the pieces of news exchanged. We filter the network of
retweets (i.e. users re-broadcasting the same elementary piece of information,
or tweet) from random noise and check the presence of messages displaying an
url. The impact of misinformation posts reaches the 22.1% in the right and
center-right wing community and its contribution is even stronger in absolute
numbers, due to the activity of this group: 96% of all non reputable urls
shared by political groups come from this community.

review recent work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, psychology
and neuroscience, indicating a new research agenda that follows the idea that
experiments will yield theoretical insight only when employed to test
brain-computational models. This view challenges the popular belief, that
tinnitus research is primarily data limited, and that producing large,
multi-modal, and complex datasets, analyzed with advanced data analysis
algorithms, will finally lead to fundamental insights into how tinnitus
emerges. However, there is converging evidence that although modern
technologies allow assessing neural activity in unprecedentedly rich ways in
both, animals and humans, empirical testing one verbally defined hypothesis
about tinnitus after another, will never lead to a mechanistic understanding.
Instead, hypothesis testing needs to be complemented with the construction of
computational models that generate verifiable predictions. We argue, that even
though, contemporary artificial intelligence and machine learning approaches
largely lack biological plausibility, the models to be constructed will have to
draw on concepts from these fields, since they have already proven to do well
in modeling brain function. Nevertheless, biological fidelity will have to be
increased successively, leading to ever better and fine-grained models,
allowing at the end for even testing possible treatment strategies in silico,

electron gyro-frequency, the magnetic field strength at the emitter site in BDR
J1750+3809 is $B\gtrsim 25\,{\rm G}$, which is comparable to planetary-scale

Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) has yielded a new diagnostic tool to
study the solar chromosphere. Here we present an overview of the
brightness-temperature fluctuations from several high-quality and
high-temporal-resolution (i.e., 1 and 2 sec cadence) time series of images
obtained during the first two years of solar observations with ALMA, in Band 3
and Band 6, centred at around 3 mm (100 GHz) and 1.25 mm (239 GHz),
respectively. The various datasets represent solar regions with different
levels of magnetic flux. We perform Fast Fourier and Lomb-Scargle transforms to
measure both the spatial structuring of dominant frequencies and the average
global frequency distributions of the oscillations (i.e., averaged over the
entire field of view). We find that the observed frequencies significantly vary
from one dataset to another, which is discussed in terms of the solar regions
captured by the observations (i.e., linked to their underlying magnetic
topology). While the presence of enhanced power within the frequency range 3-5
mHz is found for the most magnetically quiescent datasets, lower frequencies
dominate when there is significant influence from strong underlying magnetic
field concentrations (present inside and/or in the immediate vicinity of the
observed field of view). We discuss here a number of reasons which could
possibly contribute to the power suppression at around 5.5 mHz in the ALMA
observations. However, it remains unclear how other chromospheric diagnostics
(with an exception of Halpha line-core intensity) are unaffected by similar
effects, i.e., they show very pronounced 3-min oscillations dominating the
dynamics of the chromosphere, whereas only a very small fraction of all the
pixels in the ten ALMA data sets analysed here show peak power near 5.5 mHz.

it is almost impossible to accurately and manually annotate thousands of

local label point correction (LLPC) method to improve annotation quality for
edge detection and image segmentation tasks. Our algorithm contains three
steps: gradient-guided point correction, point interpolation and local point
smoothing. We correct the labels of object contours by moving the annotated
points to the pixel gradient peaks. This can improve the edge localization
accuracy, but it also causes unsmooth contours due to the interference of image
noise. Therefore, we design a point smoothing method based on local linear
fitting to smooth the corrected edge. To verify the effectiveness of our LLPC,
we construct a largest overlapping cervical cell edge detection dataset (CCEDD)
with higher precision label corrected by our label correction method. Our LLPC
only needs to set three parameters, but yields 30-40$\%$ average precision
improvement on multiple networks. The qualitative and quantitative experimental
results show that our LLPC can improve the quality of manual labels and the
accuracy of overlapping cell edge detection. We hope that our study will give a
strong boost to the development of the label correction for edge detection and
image segmentation. We will release the dataset and code at

  robot hand","Accepted into IEEE Transactions on Robotics",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Tactile sensing is used by humans when grasping to prevent us dropping
objects. One key facet of tactile sensing is slip detection, which allows a
gripper to know when a grasp is failing and take action to prevent an object
being dropped. This study demonstrates the slip detection capabilities of the
recently developed Tactile Model O (T-MO) by using support vector machines to
detect slip and test multiple slip scenarios including responding to the onset
of slip in real time with eleven different objects in various grasps. We
demonstrate the benefits of slip detection in grasping by testing two
real-world scenarios: adding weight to destabilise a grasp and using slip
detection to lift up objects at the first attempt. The T-MO is able to detect
when an object is slipping, react to stabilise the grasp and be deployed in
real-world scenarios. This shows the T-MO is a suitable platform for autonomous
grasping by using reliable slip detection to ensure a stable grasp in
unstructured environments. Supplementary video: https://youtu.be/wOwFHaiHuKY

make self-supervised learning irrelevant to the number of negative samples in
the contrastive learning framework. Inspired by the InfoMax principle, we point
that the margin term in contrastive loss needs to be adaptively scaled
according to the number of negative pairs in order to keep steady mutual
information bound and gradient magnitude. EqCo bridges the performance gap
among a wide range of negative sample sizes, so that for the first time, we can
use only a few negative pairs (e.g., 16 per query) to perform self-supervised
contrastive training on large-scale vision datasets like ImageNet, while with
almost no accuracy drop. This is quite a contrast to the widely used large
batch training or memory bank mechanism in current practices. Equipped with
EqCo, our simplified MoCo (SiMo) achieves comparable accuracy with MoCov2 on
ImageNet (linear evaluation protocol) while only involves 16 negative pairs per
query instead of 65536, suggesting that large quantities of negative samples is
not a critical factor in contrastive learning frameworks.

can be unrolled to yield a learnable neural network for improved empirical
performance. A prime example is learned ISTA (LISTA) where weights, step sizes
and thresholds are learned from training data. Recently, Analytic LISTA
(ALISTA) has been introduced, combining the strong empirical performance of a
fully learned approach like LISTA, while retaining theoretical guarantees of
classical compressed sensing algorithms and significantly reducing the number
of parameters to learn. However, these parameters are trained to work in
expectation, often leading to suboptimal reconstruction of individual targets.
In this work we therefore introduce Neurally Augmented ALISTA, in which an LSTM
network is used to compute step sizes and thresholds individually for each
target vector during reconstruction. This adaptive approach is theoretically
motivated by revisiting the recovery guarantees of ALISTA. We show that our
approach further improves empirical performance in sparse reconstruction, in
particular outperforming existing algorithms by an increasing margin as the
compression ratio becomes more challenging.

medical applications are accessible on the internet. With the intention of
limiting the costs of the learning procedure it is convenient to exploit the
information that is already available rather than collecting new data.
Nevertheless, the incapability to augment the batch can lead the autonomous
agents to develop far from optimal behaviours when the sampled experiences do
not allow for a good estimate of the true distribution of the environment.
Offline learning is the area of machine learning concerned with efficiently
obtaining an optimal policy with a batch of previously collected experiences
without further interaction with the environment. In this paper we adumbrate
the ideas motivating the development of the state-of-the-art offline learning
baselines. The listed methods consist in the introduction of epistemic
uncertainty dependent constraints during the classical resolution of a Markov
Decision Process, with and without function approximators, that aims to
alleviate the bad effects of the distributional mismatch between the available

theoretical bounds that justify the application of these algorithms and suggest
the utilization of Generative Adversarial Networks to estimate the

reproduces the orbital-pair correlation patterns in the weak-correlation limit

that pCCD-LCC predicts reliable wave functions in this regime. In the

are obtained. Through measurement of the structural factor, momentum
distribution and superfluid stiffness for various system sizes, a supersolid
phase exists stably in the triangular lattices geometry and the regime of the

characteristics of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data by, for example, using
a fixed number of slices or 2D images from each of the axial, coronal and
sagittal planes as well as combining the three planes into one multi-plane
network. Overall we achieved a performance of 93.4% AUC on the validation data
by using the more recent deep learning architectures and data augmentation
strategies. More flexible architectures are also proposed that might help with
the development and training of models that process MRIs. We found that
transfer learning and a carefully tuned data augmentation strategy were the
crucial factors in determining best performance.

involve the fusion of heterogeneous entities from many sources. Matching and
fusion of such entities require to also match and combine their properties
(attributes). However, previous schema matching approaches mostly focus on two
sources only and often rely on simple similarity measurements. They thus face
problems in challenging use cases such as the integration of heterogeneous
product entities from many sources.
  We therefore present a new machine learning-based property matching approach
called LEAPME (LEArning-based Property Matching with Embeddings) that utilizes
numerous features of both property names and instance values. The approach
heavily makes use of word embeddings to better utilize the domain-specific
semantics of both property names and instance values. The use of supervised
machine learning helps exploit the predictive power of word embeddings.
  Our comparative evaluation against five baselines for several multi-source
datasets with real-world data shows the high effectiveness of LEAPME. We also
show that our approach is even effective when training data from another domain

can significantly accelerate the growth of dust grains by accretion of
molecules, but the turbulent gas-density distribution also plays a crucial role
in shaping the grain-size distribution. The growth velocity, i.e., the rate of
change of the mean grain radius, is proportional to the local gas density if
the growth species (molecules) are well-mixed in the gas. As a consequence,
grain growth happens at vastly different rates in different locations, since
the gas-density distribution of the ISM shows a considerable variance. Here, it
is shown that grain-size distribution (GSD) rapidly becomes a reflection of the
gas-density distribution, irrespective of the shape of the initial GSD. This
result is obtained by modelling ISM turbulence as a Markov process, which in
the special case of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process leads to a lognormal
gas-density distribution, consistent with numerical simulations of isothermal
compressible turbulence. This yields an approximately lognormal GSD; the sizes
of dust grains in cold ISM clouds may thus not follow the commonly adopted
power-law GSD with index -3.5, but corroborates the use of a log-nomral GSD for
large grains, suggested by several studies. It is also concluded that the very
wide range of gas densities obtained in the high Mach-number turbulence of
molecular clouds must allow formation of a tail of very large grains reaching
radii of several microns.

the night sky, integrated over the entire thermal wavelength range of
$1-100\,\mu$m. We then analyze the thermal physics of radiative cooling with
special focus on telescopes and discuss mitigation strategies.
  Aims. The quantity $T_\text{sky}$ is useful to quantify the subcooling in
telescopes which can deteriorate the image quality by introducing an Optical
Path Difference (OPD) and induce thermal stress and mechanical deflections on
structures.
  Methods. We employ the Cerro Paranal Sky Model of the European Southern
Observatory to derive a simple formula of $T_\text{sky}$ as a function of
atmospheric parameters. The structural subcooling and the induced OPD are then
expressed as a function of surface emissivity, sky view factor, local air speed
and structure dimensions.
  Results. At Cerro Paranal (2600 m) and Cerro Armazones (3060 m) in the
Atacama desert, $T_\text{sky}$ towards the zenith mostly lies $20-50$ Kelvin
below the ambient temperature near the ground, depending strongly on the
precipitable water vapor (PWV) column in the atmosphere. The temperature
difference can decrease by several Kelvin for higher zenith distances. The
subcooling OPD scales linearly to quadratically with the telescope diameter and
is inversely proportional to the local air speed near the telescope structure.

BayesAdapter framework to relieve these concerns. In particular, we propose to
adapt pre-trained deterministic NNs to be variational BNNs via cost-effective
Bayesian fine-tuning. Technically, we develop a modularized implementation for
the learning of variational BNNs, and refurbish the generally applicable
exemplar reparameterization trick through exemplar parallelization to
efficiently reduce the gradient variance in stochastic variational inference.
Based on the lightweight Bayesian learning paradigm, we conduct extensive

consistently induce posteriors with higher quality than competitive baselines,

alternative to the well know raster and triangulated surface representations.
An LR B-spline surface has an overall smooth behaviour and allows the modelling
of local details with only a limited growth in data volume. In regions where
many data points belong to the same smooth area LR B-splines allow a very lean
representation of the shape by locally adapting the resolution of the spline
space to the size and local shape variations of the region. The surfaces
generated approximate the smooth component of a cloud of data points within
user specified tolerances. The method can be modified to improve the accuracy
in particular domains and selected data points. The resulting surfaces are well
suited for analysis and computing secondary information such as contour curves
and minimum and maximum points. The surfaces can be translated into a raster or
a tessellated surface of desired quality or exported as collections of tensor
product spline surfaces. Data transfer can also be performed using Part 42 of

wherein each GPS record in a trace is associated with a text message that
describes the user's activity. Existing methods fall short in unveiling human
movement regularities, because they either do not model the text data at all or
suffer from text sparsity severely. We propose SHMM, a multi-modal spherical
hidden Markov model for semantics-rich human mobility modeling. Under the
hidden Markov assumption, SHMM models the generation process of a given trace
by jointly considering the observed location, time, and text at each step of
the trace. The distinguishing characteristic of SHMM is the text modeling part.
We use fixed-size vector representations to encode the semantics of the text
messages, and model the generation of the l2-normalized text embeddings on a
unit sphere with the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. Compared with other
alternatives like multi-variate Gaussian, our choice of the vMF distribution
not only incurs much fewer parameters, but also better leverages the
discriminative power of text embeddings in a directional metric space. The
parameter inference for the vMF distribution is non-trivial since it involves
functional inversion of ratios of Bessel functions. We theoretically prove
that: 1) the classical Expectation-Maximization algorithm can work with vMF
distributions; and 2) while closed-form solutions are hard to be obtained for
the M-step, Newton's method is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution
with quadratic convergence rate. We have performed extensive experiments on
both synthetic and real-life data. The results on synthetic data verify our
theoretical analysis; while the results on real-life data demonstrate that SHMM
learns meaningful semantics-rich mobility models, outperforms state-of-the-art
mobility models for next location prediction, and incurs lower training cost.

glassy polymer or colloidal systems. Like those other systems, the pile
undergoes a glass transition and ""freezes"" into different non-equilibrium
glassy states at low agitation for different annealing speeds, starting from
the same initial equilibrium state at high agitation. Then, we quench the
system instantaneously from the highly-agitated state to below the glass
transition regime to study the ensuing aging dynamics. In this classical aging
protocol, the density increases (i.e., the potential energy of the pile
decreases) logarithmically over several decades in time. Instead of
system-wide, thermodynamic measures, here we identify the intermittent,
irreversible events (""quakes"") that actually drive the glassy relaxation
process. We find that the event rate decelerates hyperbolically, which explains
the observed increase in density when the integrated contribution to the
downward displacements is evaluated. We argue that such a hyperbolically
decelerating event rate is consistent with a log-Poisson process, also found as
a universal feature of aging in many thermal glasses.

second critic model is deployed in the form of an encoder-decoder RNN to encode
the latent information corresponding to the original and generated captions.
While all actor-critic methods use an actor to predict sentences for an image
and a critic to provide rewards, our proposed encoder-decoder RNN guarantees
high-level comprehension of images by sentence-to-image translation. We observe
that the proposed model generates sentences on the test data highly similar to
the ground truth and is successful in generating even better captions in many
critical cases. Extensive experiments on the benchmark Remote Sensing Image

quantitatively determined by fitting to the electron spin resonance (ESR)

anisotropy interactions, possibly along with other perturbations, e.g.
next-nearest-neighbor interactions, suppress the long-range magnetic order and
render the system disordered, as evidenced by both the absence of any clear
magnetic reflections in neutron diffraction and the presence of the dominant

of a gapless U(1) Dirac quantum spin liquid (QSL) ground state. At low
temperatures, the spectral weight of the low-energy continuous spin excitations
accumulates at the K points of the Brillouin zone, e.g. $|\mathbf{Q}|$ =

for extracting discriminative features of images and speech signals. However,
the lack of large datasets in the haptics domain often limits the applicability
of such techniques. This paper presents a general framework for the analysis of
the discriminative properties of haptic signals. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of spectral features and a boosted embedding technique in
enhancing the distinguishability of haptic signals. Experiments indicate our
framework needs less training data, generalizes well for different predictors,

equations are core to industry-standard flood models. The second-order
Discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) alternative, although a viable way forward to
improve current FV-based flood models, is yet under-studied and rarely used to
support flood modelling applications. This paper systematically explores and
compares the predictive properties of a robust DG2 flood model to those of
prominent FV-based industrial flood models. To identify the simplest and most
efficient DG2 configuration suitable for flood inundation modelling, two
variants - with and without local slope limiting - are considered. The
numerical conservation properties of the DG2 variants are compared to those of
a first-order FV (FV1) and a second-order FV (FV2) counterparts. The DG2
variants are then tested over five realistic flooding scenarios, recommended by
the UK Environment Agency to validate 2D flood model capabilities, while
comparing their performance against that of four FV-based commercial models
(i.e. TUFLOW-FV1, TUFLOW-FV2, TUFLOW-HPC and Infoworks ICM). Results reveal
that the DG2 variant without local limiting (DG2-NL) is capable to simulate
shockless flood flows featured in a wide range of flood modelling applications.
The DG2-NL shows closer predictions to commercial model outputs at
twice-coarser spatial resolution, and can run twice faster to produce more
informative hydrograph with small-scale transients over long-range simulations,
even when the sampling is far away from the flooding source.

metastability-containing circuits. The result is a simple control circuit that
may become metastable, yet deterministically avoids buffer underrun or

this may only affect oscillator speeds within specific bounds. In contrast,
communication is guaranteed to remain metastability-free. We formally prove
correctness of the producer-consumer link and a possible implementation that

We
demonstrate how this can happen in a model. The key point is that in
classically (ontologically) evolving systems one can still define a conserved
quantum energy. For the fast variables, the energy levels are far separated,
such that one may assume these variables to stay in their ground state. This
forces them to be entangled, so that, consequently, the slow variables are
entangled as well. The fast variables could be the vacuum fluctuations caused
by unknown super heavy particles. The emerging quantum effects in the light
particles are expressed by a Hamiltonian that can have almost any form. The
entire system is ontological, and yet allows one to generate interference
effects in computer models. This seemed to lead to an unsolvable paradox, which
is now resolved: exactly what happens in our models if we run a quantum
interference experiment in a classical computer is explained. The restriction
that very fast variables stay predominantly in their ground state appears to be
due to smearing of the physical states in the time direction, preventing their
direct detection. Discussions are added of the emergence of quantum mechanics,

Nonlinear Boundary Value Problems(FN-BVPs) with Robin Boundary
Conditions(RBCs). In the new numerical schemes, a two-point FNBVP is
transformed into a system of Fractional order Initial Value Problems(FIVPs)
with unknown Initial Conditions(ICs). To approximate ICs in the system of
FIVPs, we develop nonlinear shooting methods based on Newton's method and
Halley's method using the RBC at the right end point. To deal with FIVPs in a
system, we mainly employ High-order Predictor-Corrector Methods(HPCMs) with
linear interpolation and quadratic interpolation into Volterra integral
equations which are equivalent to FIVPs. The advantage of proposed schemes with
HPCMs is that even though they are designed for solving two-point FNBVPs, they
can handle both linear and nonlinear two-point Fractional order Boundary Value
Problems(FBVPs) with RBCs and have uniform convergence rates of HPCMs, $O(h^2)$
and $O(h^3)$ for shooting techniques with Newton's method and Halley's method,
respectively. A variety of numerical examples are demonstrated to confirm the
effectiveness and performance of the proposed schemes. Also we compare the

indispensable in medical image analysis and clinical research. A reliable and
effective reconstruction tool should: be fast in prediction of accurate well
localised and high resolution models, evaluate prediction uncertainty, work
with as little input data as possible. Current deep learning state of the art
(SOTA) 3D reconstruction methods, however, often only produce shapes of limited
variability positioned in a canonical position or lack uncertainty evaluation.
In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic deep learning approach for
concurrent 3D surface reconstruction from sparse 2D MR image data and aleatoric
uncertainty prediction. Our method is capable of reconstructing large surface
meshes from three quasi-orthogonal MR imaging slices from limited training sets
whilst modelling the location of each mesh vertex through a Gaussian
distribution. Prior shape information is encoded using a built-in linear
principal component analysis (PCA) model. Extensive experiments on cardiac MR
data show that our probabilistic approach successfully assesses prediction
uncertainty while at the same time qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms
SOTA methods in shape prediction. Compared to SOTA, we are capable of properly
localising and orientating the prediction via the use of a spatially aware
neural network.

\emph{minimal} and, thus, efficient structure. Examples include the Gathering
and the Chain-Formation problem. In this work, we study formation problems that
try to reach a \emph{maximal} structure, supporting for example an efficient
coverage in exploration scenarios. A recent example is the NASA Shapeshifter
project, which describes how the robots form a relay chain along which gathered
data from extraterrestrial cave explorations may be sent to a home base.
  As a first step towards understanding such maximization tasks, we introduce
and study the Max-Chain-Formation problem, where $n$ robots are ordered along a
winding, potentially self-intersecting chain and must form a connected,
straight line of maximal length connecting its two endpoints. We propose and
analyze strategies in a discrete and in a continuous time model. In the
discrete case, we give a complete analysis if all robots are initially
collinear, showing that the worst-case time to reach an
$\varepsilon$-approximation is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}(n^2 \cdot \log
(n/\varepsilon))$ and lower bounded by $\Omega(n^2 \cdot~\log
(1/\varepsilon))$. If one endpoint of the chain remains stationary, this result
can be extended to the non-collinear case. If both endpoints move, we identify
a family of instances whose runtime is unbounded. For the continuous model, we
give a strategy with an optimal runtime bound of $\Theta(n)$. Avoiding an
unbounded runtime similar to the discrete case relies crucially on a
counter-intuitive aspect of the strategy: slowing down the endpoints while all
other robots move at full speed. Surprisingly, we can show that a similar trick
does not work in the discrete model.

formal analysis. Such properties address aspects such as costs and rewards,
quality measures, resource consumption, distance metrics, etc.
  Existing solutions for problems in quantitative analysis face two challenges,
namely lack of generalizability and separation-of-techniques. Lack of
generalizability refers to the issue that solution approaches are specialized
to cost model. Different cost models deploy such disparate algorithms that
there is no transfer of knowledge from one cost model to another.
Separation-of-techniques refers to the inherent dichotomy in solving problems
in quantitative analysis. Most algorithms comprise of a structural phase which
reasons about the structure of the quantitative system(s) using techniques from
automata or graphs, and a numerical phase, which reasons about the quantitative
dimension/cost model using numerical methods. The techniques used in both
phases are so unlike each other that they are difficult to combine, thereby
impacting scalability.
  This thesis contributes to a novel framework that addresses these challenges.
The introduced framework, called comparator automata or comparators in short,
builds on automata-theoretic foundations to generalize across a variety of cost
models. Comparators enable automata-based methods in the numerical phase, hence
eradicating the dependence on numerical methods. In doing so, comparators are
able to integrate the structural and numerical phases. On the theoretical
front, we demonstrate that these have the advantage of generalizable results,
and yield complexity-theoretic improvements over a range of problems in
quantitative analysis. On the empirical front, we demonstrate that
comparator-based solutions render more efficient, scalable, and robust
performance, and are able to integrate quantitative with qualitative
objectives.

effects when different tunneling paths interfere destructively. Such effects
have been seen in several single-molecule magnets (SMMs) through measurements
of magnetization dynamics, where the experimental signal may arise from the
contributions of numerous energy levels. Here we present experimental
measurements of Berry phase interference effects that are determined through
electron-spin resonance on a four-fold symmetric SMM. Specifically, we measure
transitions between tunnel-split excited states in the Ni$_4$ SMM in the
presence of a transverse field in the hard plane of the crystalline sample. By
using a home-built rotation apparatus, the direction of the sample can be
changed \textit{in situ} so that that the field direction can be swept through
the entire hard plane of the sample. When the field is in certain directions in
the plane, we observe a splitting of the transition, a hallmark of Berry phase
interference. The experimental results are well reproduced by theoretical
predictions, and fitting of the data provides information about the effects of
dipolar interactions and sample misalignment.

to assign confidence scores to each prediction, then use these scores to filter
out possible misclassifications. However, existing confidence metrics are not
yet sufficiently reliable for this role. This paper presents a new framework
that produces a quantitative metric for detecting misclassification errors.
This framework, RED, builds an error detector on top of the base classifier and
estimates uncertainty of the detection scores using Gaussian Processes.
Experimental comparisons with other error detection methods on 125 UCI datasets
demonstrate that this approach is effective. Further implementations on two
probabilistic base classifiers and two large deep learning architecture in
vision tasks further confirm that the method is robust and scalable. Third, an
empirical analysis of RED with out-of-distribution and adversarial samples
shows that the method can be used not only to detect errors but also to
understand where they come from. RED can thereby be used to improve
trustworthiness of neural network classifiers more broadly in the future.

ratio (SHR) is not easy to interpret clinically and is valid only under the
proportional sub-distribution hazard (SDH) assumption. This paper introduces an
alternative statistical measure: the restricted mean time lost (RMTL). Methods:
First, the definition and estimation methods of the measures are introduced.
Second, based on the differences in RMTLs, a basic difference test (Diff) and a
supremum difference test (sDiff) are constructed. Then, the corresponding
sample size estimation method is proposed. The statistical properties of the
methods and the estimated sample size are evaluated using Monte Carlo
simulations, and these methods are also applied to two real examples. Results:
The simulation results show that sDiff performs well and has relatively high
test efficiency in most situations. Regarding sample size calculation, sDiff
exhibits good performance in various situations. The methods are illustrated
using two examples. Conclusions: RMTL can meaningfully summarize treatment
effects for clinical decision making, which can then be reported with the SDH
ratio for competing risks data. The proposed sDiff test and the two calculated
sample size formulas have wide applicability and can be considered in real data
analysis and trial design.

in domains as diverse as epidemiology, genomics, neuroscience, environmental
sciences, economics, and more. Matrix profile, the state-of-the-art algorithm
to perform time series analysis, computes the most similar subsequence for a
given query subsequence within a sliced time series. Matrix profile has low
arithmetic intensity, but it typically operates on large amounts of time series
data. In current computing systems, this data needs to be moved between the
off-chip memory units and the on-chip computation units for performing matrix
profile. This causes a major performance bottleneck as data movement is
extremely costly in terms of both execution time and energy.
  In this work, we present NATSA, the first Near-Data Processing accelerator
for time series analysis. The key idea is to exploit modern 3D-stacked High
Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to enable efficient and fast specialized matrix profile
computation near memory, where time series data resides. NATSA provides three
key benefits: 1) quickly computing the matrix profile for a wide range of
applications by building specialized energy-efficient floating-point arithmetic
processing units close to HBM, 2) improving the energy efficiency and execution
time by reducing the need for data movement over slow and energy-hungry buses
between the computation units and the memory units, and 3) analyzing time
series data at scale by exploiting low-latency, high-bandwidth, and
energy-efficient memory access provided by HBM. Our experimental evaluation
shows that NATSA improves performance by up to 14.2x (9.9x on average) and
reduces energy by up to 27.2x (19.4x on average), over the state-of-the-art

implementations have adopted a two-tier architecture. The first tier aims for
low-latency startup times and collects dynamic profiles, such as the dynamic
types of variables. The second tier provides high-throughput using an
optimizing compiler that specializes code to the recorded type information. If
the program behavior changes to the point that not previously seen types occur
in specialized code, that specialized code becomes invalid, it is deoptimized,
and control is transferred back to the first tier execution engine which will
start specializing anew. However, if the program behavior becomes more
specific, for instance, if a polymorphic variable becomes monomorphic, nothing
changes. Once the program is running optimized code, there are no means to
notice that an opportunity for optimization has been missed.
  We propose to employ a sampling-based profiler to monitor native code without
any instrumentation. The absence of instrumentation means that when the
profiler is not active, no overhead is incurred. We present an implementation
is in the context of the \v{R} just-in-time, optimizing compiler for the R
language. Based on the sampled profiles, we are able to detect when the native
code produced by \v{R} is specialized for stale type feedback and recompile it
to more type-specific code. We show that sampling adds an overhead of less than
3% in most cases and up to 9% in few cases and that it reliably detects stale
type feedback within milliseconds.

neutron star (NS) improve if one allows for a stiff high-density equation of
state (EoS) or a large spin. Since its mass is $\in (2.50,2.67) M_{\odot}$,
establishing its true nature will make it either the heaviest NS or the
lightest black hole (BH), and can have far-reaching implications on NS EoS and
compact object formation channels. When limiting oneself to the NS hypothesis,
we deduce the secondary's properties by using a Bayesian framework with a
hybrid EoS formulation that employs a parabolic expansion-based nuclear
empirical parameterization around the nuclear saturation density augmented by a
generic 3-segment piecewise polytrope (PP) model at higher densities and
combining a variety of astrophysical observations. For the slow-rotation
scenario, GW190814 implies a very stiff EoS and a stringent constraint on the
EoS specially in the high-density region. On the other hand assuming the
secondary object is a rapidly rotating NS, we constrain its rotational
frequency to be $f=1170^{+389}_{-495}$ Hz, within a $90\%$ confidence interval.
In this scenario, the secondary object in GW190814 would qualify as the fastest
rotating NS ever observed. However, for this scenario to be viable, rotational
instabilities would have to be suppressed both during formation and the
subsequent evolution until merger, otherwise the secondary of GW190814 is more
likely to be a BH.

several concepts used in some previous works but in a different context. There
are two main concepts: an Inconsistency Graph and Energy Flow. The
Inconsistency Graph contains news items as nodes and inconsistent opinions
between them for edges. Energy Flow assigns each node an initial energy and
then some energy is propagated along the edges until the energy distribution on
all nodes converges. To illustrate FaNDS we use the original data from the Fake
News Challenge (FNC-1). First, the data has to be reconstructed in order to

well-defined shapes that represent different types of connections between the
news items. Then the Energy Flow method is applied. The nodes with high energy

active Brownian particles exhibit steady-state phenomena that depend on both
the strength and the polarity of the applied magnetic field. The intriguing
effects of the Lorentz force, however, can only be observed when
out-of-equilibrium density gradients are maintained in the system. To this end,
we use the method of stochastic resetting on active Brownian particles in two
dimensions by resetting them to the line $x=0$ at a constant rate and
periodicity in the $y$ direction. Under stochastic resetting, an active system
settles into a nontrivial stationary state which is characterized by an
inhomogeneous density distribution, polarization and bulk fluxes perpendicular
to the density gradients. We show that whereas for a uniform magnetic field the
properties of the stationary state of the active system can be obtained from
its passive counterpart, novel features emerge in the case of an inhomogeneous
magnetic field which have no counterpart in passive systems. In particular,
there exists an activity-dependent threshold rate such that for smaller
resetting rates, the density distribution of active particles becomes
non-monotonic. We also study the mean first-passage time to the $x$ axis and
find a surprising result: it takes an active particle more time to reach the
target from any given point for the case when the magnetic field increases away
from the axis. The theoretical predictions are validated using Brownian

present a uniquely large systematic study combining the direct asteroseismic

datasets, researchers have recently proposed curating counterfactually
augmented data (CAD) via a human-in-the-loop process in which given some
documents and their (initial) labels, humans must revise the text to make a
counterfactual label applicable. Importantly, edits that are not necessary to
flip the applicable label are prohibited. Models trained on the augmented data
appear, empirically, to rely less on semantically irrelevant words and to
generalize better out of domain. While this work draws loosely on causal
thinking, the underlying causal model (even at an abstract level) and the
principles underlying the observed out-of-domain improvements remain unclear.
In this paper, we introduce a toy analog based on linear Gaussian models,
observing interesting relationships between causal models, measurement noise,
out-of-domain generalization, and reliance on spurious signals. Our analysis
provides some insights that help to explain the efficacy of CAD. Moreover, we
develop the hypothesis that while adding noise to causal features should
degrade both in-domain and out-of-domain performance, adding noise to
non-causal features should lead to relative improvements in out-of-domain
performance. This idea inspires a speculative test for determining whether a
feature attribution technique has identified the causal spans. If adding noise
(e.g., by random word flips) to the highlighted spans degrades both in-domain
and out-of-domain performance on a battery of challenge datasets, but adding
noise to the complement gives improvements out-of-domain, it suggests we have
identified causal spans. We present a large-scale empirical study comparing
spans edited to create CAD to those selected by attention and saliency maps.
Across numerous domains and models, we find that the hypothesized phenomenon is
pronounced for CAD.

data driven capacity characterization method that does not require model
information, it only needs access to a simulator. The capacity is characterized
as the set of feasible spectral densities (SDs) of the demand deviation. The
proposed method is an extension of our recent work on SD-based capacity
characterization that was limited to linear time invariant (LTI) dynamics of
loads. The method proposed here is applicable to nonlinear dynamics. Numerical
evaluation of the method is provided, including a comparison with the
model-based solution for the LTI case.

due to its practicability in relieving the exploding gradient problem.
Recently, \citet{zhang2019gradient} show that clipped (stochastic) Gradient
Descent (GD) converges faster than vanilla GD/SGD via introducing a new
assumption called $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness, which characterizes the violent
fluctuation of gradients typically encountered in deep neural networks.
However, their iteration complexities on the problem-dependent parameters are
rather pessimistic, and theoretical justification of clipping combined with
other crucial techniques, e.g. momentum acceleration, are still lacking. In
this paper, we bridge the gap by presenting a general framework to study the
clipping algorithms, which also takes momentum methods into consideration. We
provide convergence analysis of the framework in both deterministic and
stochastic setting, and demonstrate the tightness of our results by comparing
them with existing lower bounds. Our results imply that the efficiency of
clipping methods will not degenerate even in highly non-smooth regions of the
landscape. Experiments confirm the superiority of clipping-based methods in
deep learning tasks.

with high contrast but the obtained sequences usually suffer from limited
volume coverage which makes the high resolution reconstruction of organ shape
trajectories a major challenge in temporal studies. Because of the variability
of abdominal organ shapes across time and subjects, the objective of this study
is to go towards 3D dense velocity measurements to fully cover the entire
surface and to extract meaningful features characterizing the observed organ
deformations and enabling clinical action or decision. We present a pipeline
for characterization of bladder surface dynamics during deep respiratory
movements. For a compact shape representation, the reconstructed temporal
volumes were first used to establish subject-specific dynamical 4D mesh
sequences using the LDDMM framework. Then, we performed a statistical
characterization of organ dynamics from mechanical parameters such as mesh
elongations and distortions. Since we refer to organs as non flat surfaces, we
have also used the mean curvature changes as metric to quantify surface
evolution. However, the numerical computation of curvature is strongly
dependant on the surface parameterization. To cope with this dependency, we
employed a new method for surface deformation analysis. Independent of
parameterization and minimizing the length of the geodesic curves, it stretches
smoothly the surface curves towards a sphere by minimizing a Dirichlet energy.
An Eulerian PDE approach is used to derive a shape descriptor from the
curve-shortening flow. Intercorrelations between individual motion patterns are
computed using the Laplace Beltrami operator eigenfunctions for spherical
mapping. Application to extracting characterization correlation curves for
locally controlled simulated shape trajectories demonstrates the stability of
the proposed shape descriptor.

Based on the real-time COVID-19 datasets by prefecture-level cities and date,
this paper is aimed at exploring the multifractal scaling in spatial diffusion
pattern of COVID-19 pandemic and its evolution characteristics in Chinese
mainland. The ArcGIS technology and box-counting method are employed to extract
spatial data and the least square calculation is used to calculate fractal
parameters. The results show multifractal distribution of COVID-19 pandemic in
China. The generalized correlation dimension spectrums are inverse S-shaped
curves, but the fractal dimension values significantly exceeds the Euclidean
dimension of embedding space when moment order q<<0. The local singularity
spectrums are asymmetric unimodal curves, which slant to right. The fractal
dimension growth curves are shown as quasi S-shaped curves. From these
spectrums and growth curves, the main conclusions can be drawn as follows.
First, self-similar patterns developed in the process of Covid-19 pandemic,
which seem be dominated by multi-scaling law. Second, the spatial pattern of
COVID-19 across China can be characterized by global clustering with local
disordered diffusion. Third, the spatial diffusion process of COVID-19 in China
experienced four stages, i.e., initial stage, the rapid diffusion stage, the
hierarchical diffusion stage, and finally the contraction stage. This study
suggests that multifractal theory can be utilized to characterize
spatio-temporal diffusion of COVID-19 pandemic, and the case analyses may be
instructive for further exploring natural laws of spatial diffusion.

computational tools are ideal candidates for surgery planning. Finite element
(FE) simulations have shown promise in predicting stress fields on large skin
patches and complex cases, helping to identify potential regions of
complication. Unfortunately, these simulations are computationally expensive
and deterministic. However, running a few, well-selected FE simulations allows
us to create Gaussian process (GP) surrogate models of local cutaneous flaps
that are computationally efficient and able to predict stress and strain for
arbitrary material parameters. Here, we create GP surrogates for the
advancement, rotation, and transposition flaps. We then use the predictive
capability of these surrogates to perform a global sensitivity analysis,
ultimately showing that fiber direction has the most significant impact on
strain field variations. We then perform an optimization to determine the
optimal fiber direction for each flap for three different objectives driven by
clinical guidelines. While material properties are not controlled by the
surgeon and are actually a source of uncertainty, the surgeon can in fact
control the orientation of the flap. Therefore, fiber direction is the only
material parameter that can be optimized clinically. The optimization task
relies on the efficiency of the GP surrogates to calculate the expected cost of
different strategies when the uncertainty of other material parameters is
included. We propose optimal flap orientations for the three cost functions and
that can help in reducing stress resulting from the surgery and ultimately
reduce complications associated with excessive mechanical loading near wounds.

  Bayesian methods can quantify that uncertainty, and deep learning models

with an estimate of the model's uncertainty. As a result we can derive
uncertainty-aware surrogate models that can automatically suspect unseen design

paper utilizes a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the policy for
reducing the aerodynamic drag of supercritical airfoils. The policy is designed
to take actions based on features of the wall Mach number distribution so that
the learned policy can be more general. The initial policy for reinforcement
learning is pretrained through imitation learning, and the result is compared
with randomly generated initial policies. The policy is then trained in
environments based on surrogate models, of which the mean drag reduction of 200
airfoils can be effectively improved by reinforcement learning. The policy is
also tested by multiple airfoils in different flow conditions using
computational fluid dynamics calculations. The results show that the policy is
effective in both the training condition and other similar conditions, and the
policy can be applied repeatedly to achieve greater drag reduction.

faced by biologists. One area that will greatly benefit from this
cross-pollination is the problem of biological sequence design, which has
massive potential for therapeutic applications. However, significant
inefficiencies remain in communication between these fields which result in
biologists finding the progress in machine learning inaccessible, and hinder
machine learning scientists from contributing to impactful problems in
bioengineering. Sequence design can be seen as a search process on a discrete,
high-dimensional space, where each sequence is associated with a function. This
sequence-to-function map is known as a ""Fitness Landscape"". Designing a
sequence with a particular function is hence a matter of ""discovering"" such a
(often rare) sequence within this space. Today we can build predictive models
with good interpolation ability due to impressive progress in the synthesis and
testing of biological sequences in large numbers, which enables model training
and validation. However, it often remains a challenge to find useful sequences
with the properties that we like using these models. In particular, in this
primer we highlight that algorithms for experimental design, what we call
""exploration strategies"", are a related, yet distinct problem from building
good models of sequence-to-function maps. We review advances and insights from
current literature -- by no means a complete treatment -- while highlighting
desirable features of optimal model-guided exploration, and cover potential
pitfalls drawn from our own experience. This primer can serve as a starting
point for researchers from different domains that are interested in the problem
of searching a sequence space with a model, but are perhaps unaware of
approaches that originate outside their field.

  Subject Specific Question Banks","8 pages, 5 figures, Submitted to EAAI21",,,,"cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been an increasingly popular trend in Universities for curriculum
transformation to make teaching more interactive and suitable for online
courses. An increase in the popularity of online courses would result in an
increase in the number of course-related queries for academics. This, coupled
with the fact that if lectures were delivered in a video on demand format,
there would be no fixed time where the majority of students could ask
questions. When questions are asked in a lecture there is a negligible chance
of having similar questions repeatedly, but asynchronously this is more likely.
In order to reduce the time spent on answering each individual question,
clustering them is an ideal choice. There are different unsupervised models fit
for text clustering, of which the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model is the most
commonly used. We use the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process to determine an
optimal topic number input for our LDA model runs. Due to the probabilistic
nature of these topic models, the outputs of them vary for different runs. The
general trend we found is that not all the topics were being used for
clustering on the first run of the LDA model, which results in a less effective
clustering. To tackle probabilistic output, we recursively use the LDA model on
the effective topics being used until we obtain an efficiency ratio of 1.
Through our experimental results we also establish a reasoning on how Zeno's
paradox is avoided.

  Detecting Pneumonia Opacity from Chest X-ray Images",,,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pneumonia is one of the most acute respiratory diseases having remarkably
high prevalence and mortality rate. Chest X-ray (CXR) has been widely utilized
for the diagnosis of this disease owing to its availability, diagnostic speed
and accuracy. However, even for an expert radiologist, it is quite challenging
to readily determine pneumonia opacity by examining CXRs. Therefore, this study
has been structured to automate the pneumonia detection process by introducing
a robust deep learning framework. The proposed network comprises of Process
Convolution (Pro_Conv) blocks for feature accumulation inside Dual Feedback
(DF) blocks to propagate the feature maps towards a viable detection.
Experimental analysis showcase: (1) the proposed network proficiently
distinguishes between normal and pneumonia opacity containing CXRs with the
mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 97.78%, 98.84% and 95.04%,
respectively; (2) the network is constructed with significantly low parameters
than the traditional ImageNets to reduce memory consumption for deployment in
memory constrained mobile platforms; (3) the trade-off between accuracy and
number of parameters of the model outperforms the considered classical networks
by a remarkable margin; and (4) the false-negatives are lower than the
false-positives (both of which are low in count) which prove the model's
low-fatality prediction. Hence, the proposed network can be deployed for a
rapid screening of pneumonia and can act as a great assistive tool for the
radiologists in the diagnosis process.
