  Optimization via Simulation""",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose new sequential simulation-optimization algorithms for general
convex optimization via simulation problems with high-dimensional discrete
decision space. The performance of each choice of discrete decision variables
is evaluated via stochastic simulation replications. If an upper bound on the
overall level of uncertainties is known, our proposed simulation-optimization
algorithms utilize the discrete convex structure and are guaranteed with high
probability to find a solution that is close to the best within any given
user-specified precision level. The proposed algorithms work for any general
convex problem and the efficiency is demonstrated by proven upper bounds on
simulation costs. The upper bounds demonstrate a polynomial dependence on the
dimension and scale of the decision space. For some discrete optimization via
simulation problems, a gradient estimator may be available at low costs along
with a single simulation replication. By integrating gradient estimators, which
are possibly biased, we propose simulation-optimization algorithms to achieve
optimality guarantees with a reduced dependence on the dimension under moderate
assumptions on the bias.

dataset, particularly in determining fitness for use and in eliminating bias
and unfairness. While counts of individual attribute values may be stored in
some dataset profiles, there are too many combinations of attributes for it to
be practical to store counts for each combination. In this paper, we develop
the notion of storing a ""label"" of limited size that can be used to obtain good
estimates for these counts. A label, in this paper, contains information
regarding the count of selected patterns--attributes values combinations--in
the data. We define an estimation function, that uses this label to estimate
the count of every pattern. We present the problem of finding the optimal label
given a bound on its size and propose a heuristic algorithm for generating
optimal labels. We experimentally show the accuracy of count estimates derived
from the resulting labels and the efficiency of our algorithm.

inductive biases controlled by a kernel function. Learning occurs through the
optimisation of kernel hyperparameters using the marginal likelihood as the
objective. This classical approach known as Type-II maximum likelihood (ML-II)
yields point estimates of the hyperparameters, and continues to be the default
method for training GPs. However, this approach risks underestimating
predictive uncertainty and is prone to overfitting especially when there are
many hyperparameters. Furthermore, gradient based optimisation makes ML-II
point estimates highly susceptible to the presence of local minima. This work
presents an alternative learning procedure where the hyperparameters of the
kernel function are marginalised using Nested Sampling (NS), a technique that
is well suited to sample from complex, multi-modal distributions. We focus on
regression tasks with the spectral mixture (SM) class of kernels and find that
a principled approach to quantifying model uncertainty leads to substantial
gains in predictive performance across a range of synthetic and benchmark data
sets. In this context, nested sampling is also found to offer a speed advantage
over Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), widely considered to be the gold-standard
in MCMC based inference.

analytically the R\'enyi entropy in the extremely gapped limit and find
different additional contributions to the universal R\'enyi entropy in various

when the momentum differences of the excited quasiparticles are small. The
R\'enyi entropy derived in the extremely gapped limit is still valid in the
slightly gapped and even critical chains as long as all the momenta of the

universal even though it is only valid for double interval in the spin-1/2 XY

analytically a novel formula for the R\'enyi entropy written as the permanent

generically neither polynomial nor spatially local. The corresponding reduced

explained by generalized reciprocity, a behavioral mechanism based on the
principle of ""help anyone if helped by someone"". In complex systems, the
cooperative dynamics is largely determined by the network structure which
dictates the interactions among neighboring individuals. Despite an abundance
of studies, the role of the network structure in in promoting cooperation
through generalized reciprocity remains an under-explored phenomenon. In this
doctoral thesis, we utilize basic tools from the dynamical systems theory, and
develop a unifying framework for investigating the cooperation dynamics of
generalized reciprocity on complex networks. We use this framework to present a
theoretical overview on the role of generalized reciprocity in promoting
cooperation in three distinct interaction structures: i) social dilemmas, ii)
multidimensional networks, and iii) fluctuating environments. The results
suggest that cooperation through generalized reciprocity always emerges as the
unique attractor in which the overall level of cooperation is maximized, while
simultaneously exploitation of the participating individuals is prevented. The
effect of the network structure is captured by a local centrality measure which
uniquely quantifies the propensity of the network structure to cooperation, by
dictating the degree of cooperation displayed both at microscopic and
macroscopic level. As a consequence, the implementation of our results may go
beyond explaining the evolution of cooperation. In particular, they can be
directly applied in domains that deal with the development of artificial
systems able to adequately mimic reality, such as reinforcement learning.

model ensembles from different supervised learning methods. Recently, automated
machine learning (AutoML) is emerging as a promising approach to automate
predictive model development. Neural architecture search (NAS) is an AutoML
approach that generates and evaluates multiple neural network architectures
concurrently and improves the accuracy of the generated models iteratively. A
key issue in NAS, particularly for large data sets, is the large computation
time required to evaluate each generated architecture. While data-parallel
training is a promising approach that can address this issue, its use within
NAS is difficult. For different data sets, the data-parallel training settings
such as the number of parallel processes, learning rate, and batch size need to
be adapted to achieve high accuracy and reduction in training time. To that
end, we have developed AgEBO-Tabular, an approach to combine aging evolution
(AgE), a parallel NAS method that searches over neural architecture space, and
an asynchronous Bayesian optimization method for tuning the hyperparameters of
the data-parallel training simultaneously. We demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed method to generate high-performing neural network models for large
tabular benchmark data sets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the automatically
discovered neural network models using our method outperform the
state-of-the-art AutoML ensemble models in inference speed by two orders of
magnitude while reaching similar accuracy values.

demonstrated for the Lorenz attractor, ECG heartbeat signals, Kolmogorov flow,

variables. For depinning of elastic manifolds, these are the position of its
center of mass $u$, and the statistics of the forces $F(u)$. There are two
proposals to model the latter: as a random walk (ABBM model), or as
uncorrelated forces at integer $u$ (discretized particle model, DPM). While for
many experiments ABBM (in the literature misleadingly equated with mean-field
theory) makes quantitatively correct predictions, the microscopic disorder
force-force correlations cannot grow linearly, and thus unboundedly as a random
walk. Even the effective (renormalized) disorder forces which do so at small
distances are bounded at large distances. We propose to model forces as an
Ornstein Uhlenbeck process. The latter behaves as a random walk at small
scales, and is uncorrelated at large ones. By connecting to results in both
limits, we solve the model largely analytically, allowing us to describe in all
regimes the distributions of velocity, avalanche size and duration. To
establish experimental signatures of this transition, we study the response
function, and the correlation function of position $u$, velocity $\dot u$ and
forces $F$ under slow driving with velocity $v>0$. While at $v=0$ force or
position correlations have a cusp at the origin, this cusp is rounded at a
finite driving velocity. We give a detailed analytic analysis for this rounding
by velocity, which allows us, given experimental data, to extract the
time-scale of the response function, and to reconstruct the force-force
correlator at $v=0$. The latter is the central object of the field theory, and
as such contains detailed information about the universality class in question.
We test our predictions by careful numerical simulations extending over up to
ten orders in magnitude.

In the case of the companion the spin angular momentum is assumed small enough

general, though it was recently proven for bipartite graphs under

for pathologists. In this study, we developed a deep neural network model that
can accurately classify digitized surgical resection slides and biopsy slides
into five related classes: clear cell RCC, papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC,
renal oncocytoma, and normal. In addition to the whole-slide classification
pipeline, we visualized the identified indicative regions and features on
slides for classification by reprocessing patch-level classification results to
ensure the explainability of our diagnostic model. We evaluated our model on
independent test sets of 78 surgical resection whole slides and 79 biopsy
slides from our tertiary medical institution, and 69 randomly selected surgical
resection slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The average area
under the curve (AUC) of our classifier on the internal resection slides,
internal biopsy slides, and external TCGA slides is 0.98, 0.98 and 0.99,
respectively. Our results suggest that the high generalizability of our
approach across different data sources and specimen types. More importantly,
our model has the potential to assist pathologists by (1) automatically
pre-screening slides to reduce false-negative cases, (2) highlighting regions

Ginzburg-Landau cross field generation methods with a new formulation that
allows a user to impose inner singularities. The cross field is computed via
the optimization of a linear objective function with localized quadratic

also propose a way to calculate the Ginzburg-Landau energy of these cross

energy converges to the energy of the Ginzburg-Landau functional as epsilon and
the radius of the holes tend to zero. To obtain insights concerning the sum of

of these three properties in their strongest notions, while trying to improve
on the third dimension. In this paper, we are motivated by the following
question: Is there a strategy-proof and envy-free random assignment mechanism
more efficient than equal division?
  Our contributions in this paper are twofold. First, we further explore the
incompatibility between efficiency and envy-freeness in the class of
strategy-proof mechanisms. We define a new notion of efficiency that is weaker
than ex-post efficiency and prove that any strategy-proof and envy-free
mechanism must sacrifice efficiency even in this very weak sense. Next, we
introduce a new family of mechanisms called Pairwise Exchange mechanisms and
make the surprising observation that strategy-proofness is equivalent to
envy-freeness within this class. We characterize the set of all neutral and

that they admit a very simple linear representation.

nondeterminism introduces subtle errors that are both hard to detect and to
reproduce. The most common concurrency errors are (data) races, which occur
when memory-conflicting actions are executed concurrently. Consequently,
considerable effort has been made towards developing efficient techniques for
race detection. The most common approach is dynamic race prediction: given an
observed, race-free trace $\sigma$ of a concurrent program, the task is to
decide whether events of $\sigma$ can be correctly reordered to a trace
$\sigma^*$ that witnesses a race hidden in $\sigma$.
  In this work we introduce the notion of sync(hronization)-preserving races. A
sync-preserving race occurs in $\sigma$ when there is a witness $\sigma^*$ in
which synchronization operations (e.g., acquisition and release of locks)
appear in the same order as in $\sigma$. This is a broad definition that
strictly subsumes the famous notion of happens-before races. Our main results
are as follows. First, we develop a sound and complete algorithm for predicting
sync-preserving races. For moderate values of parameters like the number of
threads, the algorithm runs in $\widetilde{O}(\mathcal{N})$ time and space,
where $\mathcal{N}$ is the length of the trace $\sigma$. Second, we show that
the problem has a $\Omega(\mathcal{N}/\log^2 \mathcal{N})$ space lower bound,
and thus our algorithm is essentially time and space optimal. Third, we show
that predicting races with even just a single reversal of two sync operations
is $\operatorname{NP}$-complete and even $\operatorname{W}[1]$-hard when
parameterized by the number of threads. Thus, sync-preservation characterizes
exactly the tractability boundary of race prediction, and our algorithm is
nearly optimal for the tractable side.

an electric current, thus accounting for the persistent conversion of chemical

This paper studies how the choice of training objective affects the
transferability of the hidden representations of convolutional neural networks
trained on ImageNet. We show that many objectives lead to statistically
significant improvements in ImageNet accuracy over vanilla softmax
cross-entropy, but the resulting fixed feature extractors transfer
substantially worse to downstream tasks, and the choice of loss has little
effect when networks are fully fine-tuned on the new tasks. Using centered
kernel alignment to measure similarity between hidden representations of
networks, we find that differences among loss functions are apparent only in
the last few layers of the network. We delve deeper into representations of the
penultimate layer, finding that different objectives and hyperparameter
combinations lead to dramatically different levels of class separation.
Representations with higher class separation obtain higher accuracy on the
original task, but their features are less useful for downstream tasks. Our
results suggest there exists a trade-off between learning invariant features

star-forming galaxies is a valuable source of information on the star formation
history of the Universe. In measurements of the millimeter sky at frequencies
higher than $\sim 300$ GHz, the CIB and thermal emission from Galactic dust
dominate. A limited understanding of the CIB contribution at lower frequencies
on the other hand can hinder efforts to measure the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich
spectrum on small scales as well as new physics that affects the damping tail
of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The Planck satellite has measured
with high fidelity the CIB at 217, 353, 545 and 857 GHz. On very large scales,
this measurement is limited by our ability to separate the CIB from Galactic
dust, but on intermediate scales, the measurements are limited by sample
variance in the underlying matter field traced by the CIB. We show how
significant improvements (20-100%) can be obtained on parameters of star
formation models by cross-correlating the CIB (as measured from existing {\it
Planck} maps or upcoming CCAT-prime maps) with upcoming mass maps inferred from
gravitational lensing of the CMB. This improvement comes from improved
knowledge of the redshift distribution of star-forming galaxies as well as
through the use of the unbiased matter density inferred from CMB lensing mass
maps to cancel the sample variance in the CIB field. We also find that further
improvements can be obtained on CIB model parameters if the cross-correlation
of the CIB with CMB lensing is measured over a wider area while restricting the
more challenging CIB auto-spectrum measurement to the cleanest 5% of the sky.

from the perspective of sample complexity, thus taking a firm step towards
answering this important question. We find that depending on the type of data

see that the two approaches not only arrive at the same asymptotic solution,
but also have similar finite sample behavior with no clear winner. For other
distribution shifts such as those involving confounders or anti-causal
variables, however, the two approaches arrive at different asymptotic solutions
where IRM is guaranteed to be close to the desired OOD solutions in the finite

no information about when the observations were collected. We trained our

rate of experimental quantum gates. Traditional RB, however, is restricted to
gatesets, such as the Clifford group, that form a unitary 2-design. The
recently introduced character RB can benchmark more general gates using
techniques from representation theory; up to now, however, this method has only
been applied to ""multiplicity-free"" groups, a mathematical restriction on these
groups. In this paper, we extend the original character RB derivation to
explicitly treat non-multiplicity-free groups, and derive several applications.
First, we derive a rigorous version of the recently introduced subspace RB,
which seeks to characterize a set of one- and two-qubit gates that are
symmetric under SWAP. Second, we develop a new leakage RB protocol that applies
to more general groups of gates. Finally, we derive a scalable RB protocol for
the matchgate group, a group that like the Clifford group is non-universal but
becomes universal with the addition of one additional gate. This example
provides one of the few examples of a scalable non-Clifford RB protocol. In all
three cases, compared to existing theories, our method requires similar
resources, but either provides a more accurate estimate of gate fidelity, or
applies to a more general group of gates. In conclusion, we discuss the
potential, and challenges, of using non-multiplicity-free character RB to
develop new classes of scalable RB protocols and methods of characterizing
specific gates.

problem of binary-single star-scattering consists of finding the probability
distribution of the orbital parameters of the remnant binary, as a function of
the total energy and the total angular momentum. Here, we model the encounter
as a series of close, non-hierarchical, triple approaches, interspersed with
hierarchical phases, in which the system consists of an inner binary and a star
that orbits it -- this turns the evolution of the entire encounter to a random
walk between consecutive hierarchical phases. We use the solution of the bound,
non-hierarchical three-body problem to find the walker's transition
probabilities, which we generalise to situations in which tidal interactions
are important. Besides tides, any dissipative process may be incorporated into
the random walk model, as it is completely general. Our approximate solution
can reproduce the results of the extensive body of past numerical simulations,
and can account for different environments and different dissipative effects.
Therefore, this model can effectively replace the need for direct few-body

Furthermore, it allows for a simply inclusion of dissipative forces typically
not accounted for in full N-body integration schemes.

Burgers equation by providing a solution theory that builds on the energy
solution theory Goncalves-Jara '14, Gubinelli-Jara '13, Gubinelli-Perkowski

stochastic Burgers equation by writing its solution as a probabilistic solution
Gubinelli-Perkowski '17 plus a term that can be studied with deterministic PDE
considerations. One motivation is universality of KPZ and stochastic Burgers
equations for a certain class of stochastic PDE growth models, first studied in
Hairer-Quastel '18. For this, we prove universality for SPDEs with general
nonlinearities, thereby extending Hairer-Quastel '18, Hairer-Xu '19, and for
many non-stationary initial data, thereby extending Gubinelli-Perkowski '16.
Our perspective lets us also prove explicit rates of convergence to white noise
invariant measure of stochastic Burgers for non-stationary initial data, in
particular extending the spectral gap result of Gubinelli-Perkowski '20 beyond
stationary initial data, though for non-stationary data our convergence will be
measured in Wasserstein distance and relative entropy, not via the spectral gap
as in Gubinelli-Perkowski '20. Actually, we extend the spectral gap in
Gubinelli-Perkowski '20 to a log-Sobolev inequality. Our methods can also
analyze fractional stochastic Burgers equations; we discuss this briefly.
Lastly, we note that our perspective on the KPZ and stochastic Burgers
equations provides a first intrinsic notion of solutions for general continuous
initial data, in contrast to Holder regular data needed for regularity
structures, paracontrolled distributions, and Holder-regular Brownian bridge
data for energy solutions.

satellite galaxies display similar stellar mass -- size relations, their halo
mass -- size relations differ significantly. As expected, more massive haloes
tend to host larger central galaxies. However, the size of satellite galaxies
depends only slightly on halo virial mass. We show that these results are
compatible with a remarkably simple model in which the size of central and
satellite galaxies scales as the cubic root of their host halo mass, with the
normalization for satellites being $\sim$ 30 \% smaller than that for central
galaxies, which can be attributed to tidal stripping. We further check that our
measurements are in excellent agreement with predictions from the IllustrisTNG
hydrodynamical simulation. In the second part of this paper, we analyse how the
clustering properties of central and satellite galaxies depend on their size.
We demonstrate that, independently of the stellar mass threshold adopted,
smaller galaxies are more tightly clustered than larger galaxies when either
the entire sample or only satellites are considered. The opposite trend is
observed on large scales when the size split is performed for the central
galaxies alone. Our results place significant constraints for halo-galaxy

Probe (PSP), at radial distances of $\sim 28-55R_{\odot}$, are used to
constrain the solar wind AM-loss rate. For the first time with PSP, this
includes a measurement of the alpha particle contribution. The mechanical AM
flux in the solar wind protons (core and beam), and alpha particles, is
determined as well as the transport of AM through stresses in the
interplanetary magnetic field. The solar wind AM flux is averaged over three
hour increments, so that our findings more accurately represent the bulk flow.
During the third and fourth perihelion passes of PSP, the alpha particles
contain around a fifth of the mechanical AM flux in the solar wind (the rest is
carried by the protons). The proton beam is found to contain $\sim 10-50\%$ of
the proton AM flux. The sign of the alpha particle AM flux is observed to
correlate with the proton core. The slow wind has a positive AM flux (removing
AM from the Sun as expected), and the fast wind has a negative AM flux. As with
previous works, the differential velocity between the alpha particles and the
proton core tends to be aligned with the interplanetary magnetic field. In
future, by utilising the trends in the alpha-proton differential velocity, it
may be possible to estimate the alpha particle contribution when only
measurements of the proton core are available. Based on the observations from
this work, the alpha particles contribute an additional $10-20\%$ to estimates
of the solar wind AM-loss rate which consider only the proton and magnetic
field contributions. Additionally, the AM flux of the proton beam can be just
as significant as the alpha particles, and so should not be neglected in future
studies.

removal of the activity signals, the heliocentric solar velocity residuals are

the ACF subspace isolates these signals effectively from solar activity
signals. Their semi-amplitudes are recovered with a precision of $\sim~6.6$ cm

of astrophysics. Such collisions are typically mediated by chaotic, bound
gravitational interactions involving small numbers of particles. An important
application is stellar collisions, which occur commonly in dense star clusters,
and their relevance for the formation of various types of stellar exotica. In
this paper, we return to our study of the collision rates and probabilities
during small-number chaotic gravitational interactions ($N$ $\lesssim$ 10),
moving beyond the small-number particle limit and into the realm of larger
particle numbers ($N$ $\gtrsim$ 10$^3$) to test the extent of validity of our
analytic model as a function of the particle properties and the number of
interacting particles. This is done using direct $N$-body simulations of
stellar collisions in dense star clusters, by varying the relative numbers of
particles with different particle masses and radii. We compute the predicted
rate of collisions using the mean free path approximation, adopting the
point-particle limit and using the sticky-star approximation as our collision
criterion. We evaluate its efficacy in the regime where gravitational-focusing

protoplanets and compare them with the often assumed case of a circular orbit.
To this end, we perform a set of 3D hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanets
with small eccentricities ($e\leq 0.1$). We adopt an isothermal equation of
state and concentrate resolution on the protoplanet to investigate flows down
to the scale of the protoplanet's circumplanetary disk (CPD). We find enhanced
prograde rotation exterior to the CPD for low planet masses undergoing subsonic
eccentric motion. If the eccentricity is made large enough to develop a bow
shock, this trend reverses and rotation becomes increasingly retrograde. The
instantaneous eccentric flow field is dramatically altered compared to circular
orbits. Whereas the latter exhibit a generic pattern of polar inflow and
midplane outflow, the flow geometry depends on orbital phase in the eccentric
case. For even the modest eccentricities tested here, the dominant source of
inflow can come from the midplane instead of the poles. We find that the amount
of inflow and outflow increases for higher $e$ and lower protoplanet masses,
thereby recycling more gas through the planet's Bondi radius. These increased
fluxes may increase the pebble accretion rate for eccentric planets up to
several times that of the circular orbit rate. In response to eccentric motion,
the structure and rotation of the planet's bound CPD remains unchanged. Because
the CPD regulates the eventual accretion of gas onto the planet, we predict
little change to the gas accretion rates between eccentric and circular
planets.

lead to decompactification of the theory or result in a weakly coupled string
theory. We verify this conjecture in the framework of $N=1$ supersymmetric
F-theory compactifications to four dimensions including perturbative $\alpha'$
as well as non-perturbative corrections. After proving uniqueness of the
emergent critical string at the classical level, we show that quantum
corrections obstruct precisely those limits in which the scale of the emergent
critical string would lie parametrically below the Kaluza-Klein scale. Limits
in which the tension of the asymptotically tensionless string sits at the
Kaluza-Klein scale, by contrast, are not obstructed. In the second part of the
paper we study the effect of quantum corrections for the Weak Gravity
Conjecture away from the strict weak coupling limit. We propose that gauge
threshold corrections and mass renormalisation effects modify the
super-extremality bound in four dimensions. For the infinite distance limits in
F-theory the classical super-extremality bound is generically satisfied by a
sublattice of states in the tower of excitations of an emergent heterotic
string. By matching the F-theory $\alpha'$ corrections to gauge threshold
corrections of the dual heterotic theory we predict how the masses of this
tower must be renormalised in order for the Weak Gravity Conjecture to hold at

commercially available scintillation dosimetry platform capable of multi-point
dosimetry through the hyperspectral approach. Optic and dosimetric performances
of the system were investigated through comparison with another commercially
available solution, the Ocean Optics QE65Pro spectrometer. The optical
characterization was accomplished by measuring the linearity of the signal as a
function of integration time, photon detection efficiency and spectral
resolution for both systems. Dosimetric performances were then evaluated with a
3-point plastic scintillator detector (mPSD) in terms of signal to noise ratio
(SNR) and signal to background ratio (SBR) associated with each scintillator.
The latter were subsequently compared with those found in the literature for
the Exradin W1, a single-point plastic scintillator detector. Finally, various
beam measurements were realized with the HYPERSCINT platform to evaluate its
ability to perform clinical photon beam dosimetry. Both systems were found to
be comparable in terms of linearity of the signal as a function of the
intensity. Although the QE65Pro possesses a higher spectral resolution, the
detection efficency of the HYPERSCINT is up to 1000 time greater. Dosimetric
measurements shows that the latter also offers a better SNR and SBR, surpassing
even the SNR of the Exradin W1 single-point PSD. While the doses ranging from 1
cGy to 600 cGy were accurately measured within 2.1% of the predicted dose using
the HYPERSCINT platform coupled to the mPSD, the Ocean optics spectrometer
shows discrepencies up to 86% under 50cGy. Similarly, depth dose, full width at

investigation. In this work, we use tools from information geometry to define a
notion of expressibility for quantum and classical models. The effective
dimension, which depends on the Fisher information, is used to prove a novel
generalisation bound and establish a robust measure of expressibility. We show
that quantum neural networks are able to achieve a significantly better
effective dimension than comparable classical neural networks. To then assess
the trainability of quantum models, we connect the Fisher information spectrum
to barren plateaus, the problem of vanishing gradients. Importantly, certain
quantum neural networks can show resilience to this phenomenon and train faster
than classical models due to their favourable optimisation landscapes, captured
by a more evenly spread Fisher information spectrum. Our work is the first to
demonstrate that well-designed quantum neural networks offer an advantage over
classical neural networks through a higher effective dimension and faster
training ability, which we verify on real quantum hardware.

A set $M$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is a \emph{distance-edge-monitoring set}
if for every edge $e$ of $G$, there is a vertex $x$ of $M$ and a vertex $y$ of
$G$ such that $e$ belongs to all shortest paths between $x$ and $y$. We denote
by $dem(G)$ the smallest size of such a set in $G$. The vertices of $M$
represent distance probes in a network modeled by $G$; when the edge $e$ fails,
the distance from $x$ to $y$ increases, and thus we are able to detect the
failure. It turns out that not only we can detect it, but we can even correctly
locate the failing edge.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of this new concept. We show that for a
nontrivial connected graph $G$ of order $n$, $1\leq dem(G)\leq n-1$ with
$dem(G)=1$ if and only if $G$ is a tree, and $dem(G)=n-1$ if and only if it is
a complete graph. We compute the exact value of $dem$ for grids, hypercubes,
and complete bipartite graphs.
  Then, we relate $dem$ to other standard graph parameters. We show that
$demG)$ is lower-bounded by the arboricity of the graph, and upper-bounded by
its vertex cover number. It is also upper-bounded by twice its feedback edge
set number. Moreover, we characterize connected graphs $G$ with $dem(G)=2$.
  Then, we show that determining $dem(G)$ for an input graph $G$ is an
NP-complete problem, even for apex graphs. There exists a polynomial-time
logarithmic-factor approximation algorithm, however it is NP-hard to compute an
asymptotically better approximation, even for bipartite graphs of small
diameter and for bipartite subcubic graphs. For such instances, the problem is
also unlikey to be fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by the solution
size.

has recently been emphasized in a recent series of papers due to Varadarajan et
al. The simplification from SU(2) to U(1)$^3$ can be performed simply by hand
within the Hamiltonian formulation by dropping all non-Abelian terms from the
Gauss, spatial diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints respectively.
However, one may ask from which Lagrangian formulation this theory descends.
For the SU(2) theory it is known that one can choose the Palatini action, Holst
action or (anti-)selfdual action (Euclidian signature) as starting point all
leading to equivalent Hamiltonian formulations. In this paper we systematically
analyse this question directly for the U(1)$^3$ theory. Surprisingly, it turns
out that the Abelian analog of the Palatini or Holst formulation is a
consistent but topological theory without propagating degrees of freedom. On
the other hand, a twisted Abelian analog of the (anti-)selfdual formulation
does lead to the desired Hamiltonian formulation. A new aspect of our
derivation is that we work with 1. half-density valued tetrads which simplifies
the analysis, 2. without the simplicity constraint (which admits one undesired
solution that is usually neglected by hand) and 3. without imposing the time
gauge from the beginning. As a byproduct we show that also the non-Abelian
theory admits a twisted (anti-)selfdual formulation. Finally we also derive a
pure connection formulation of Euclidian GR including a cosmological constant
by extending previous work due to Capovilla, Dell, Jacobson and Peldan which
may be an interesting starting point for path integral investigations and
displays (Euclidian) GR as a Yang-Mills theory with non-polynomial Lagrangian.

streaming scenarios since self-attention is computed over an entire input
sequence and the computational cost grows quadratically with the length of the
input sequence. Nevertheless, most of the previous work on simultaneous speech
translation, the task of generating translations from partial audio input,
ignores the time spent in generating the translation when analyzing the
latency. With this assumption, a system may have good latency quality
trade-offs but be inapplicable in real-time scenarios. In this paper, we focus
on the task of streaming simultaneous speech translation, where the systems are
not only capable of translating with partial input but are also able to handle
very long or continuous input. We propose an end-to-end transformer-based

mobility for all has led us to expand deployment of automated vehicles on
public roads without a human driver behind the wheel. As part of this process,
Waymo is committed to providing the public with informative and relevant data
regarding the demonstrated safety of Waymo's automated driving system, which we
call the Waymo Driver. The data presented in this paper represents more than
6.1 million miles of automated driving in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan
area, including operations with a trained operator behind the steering wheel
from calendar year 2019 and 65,000 miles of driverless operation without a
human behind the steering wheel from 2019 and the first nine months of 2020.
The paper includes every collision and minor contact experienced during these
operations as well as every predicted contact identified using Waymo's
counterfactual, what if, simulation of events had the vehicle's trained
operator not disengaged automated driving. There were 47 contact events that
occurred over this time period, consisting of 18 actual and 29 simulated
contact events, none of which would be expected to result in severe or life
threatening injuries. This paper presents the collision typology and severity
for each actual and simulated event, along with diagrams depicting each of the
most significant events. Nearly all the events involved one or more road rule
violations or other errors by a human driver or road user, including all eight
of the most severe events, which we define as involving actual or expected
airbag deployment in any involved vehicle. When compared to national collision
statistics, the Waymo Driver completely avoided certain collision modes that
human driven vehicles are frequently involved in, including road departure and
collisions with fixed objects.

for long-range interacting spins, where the speed of propagation of the

do posses a linear light cone shortly after a perturbation takes place.
Specifically, a power-law expansion occurs which is followed by a linear
propagation of the associated interaction. As opposed to the quantum case, and

Its dynamic
role in the contraction of the diffuse gas into molecular clouds is commonly
assumed to be negligible because of the small mass fraction, $f \simeq 0.01$.
However, as shown in this study, the collective motion of dust grains with
respect to the gas may considerably contribute to the destabilisation of the
medium on scales $\lambda \lesssim \lambda_J$, where $\lambda_J$ is the Jeans
length-scale. The linear perturbations of the uniform self-gravitating gas at
rest are marginally stable at $\lambda \simeq \lambda_J$, but as soon as the
drift of grains is taken into account, they begin growing at a rate
approximately equal to $(f \tau)^{1/3} t^{-1}_{ff}$, where $\tau$ is the
stopping time of grains expressed in units of the free fall time of the cloud,
$t_{ff}$. The physical mechanism responsible for such a weak dependence of the
growth rate on $f$ is the resonance of heavy sound waves stopped by the
self-gravity of gas with weak gravitational attraction caused by perturbations
of the dust fraction. Once there is stationary subsonic bulk drift of the dust,
the growing gas-dust perturbations at $\lambda < \lambda_J$ become waves
propagating with the drift velocity projected onto the wavevector. Their growth
has a resonant nature as well and the growth rate is substantially larger than
that of the recently discovered resonant instability of gas-dust mixture in the
absence of self-gravity. The new instabilities can facilitate gravitational
contraction of cold interstellar gas into clouds and additionally produce dusty
domains of sub-Jeans size at different stages of molecular cloud formation and
evolution.

technology with the pyramid wavefront sensor (PWFS). With this new module we
observed SR~21, a young star that is brighter at NIR wavelengths than at
optical wavelengths. Compared with the archival data of SR~21 taken with the
optical wavefront sensing we achieved $\sim$20\% better Strehl ratio in similar
natural seeing conditions. Further post-processing utilizing angular
differential imaging and reference-star differential imaging confirmed the
spiral feature reported by the VLT/SPHERE polarimetric observation, which is

called the black-hole shadow, which depends only on spacetime/observer geometry
and which conveys information about the black hole's mass and spin. Conversely,
the observed central brightness depression, or image shadow, additionally
depends on the morphology of the emission region. In this paper, we investigate
the astrophysical requirements for observing a meaningful black-hole shadow in
GRMHD-based models of accreting black holes. In particular, we identify two
processes by which the image shadow can differ from the black-hole shadow:
evacuation of the innermost region of the accretion flow, which can render the
image shadow larger than the black-hole shadow, and obscuration of the
black-hole shadow by optically thick regions of the accretion flow, which can
render the image shadow smaller than the black-hole shadow, or eliminate it
altogether. We investigate in which models the image shadows of our models
match their corresponding black-hole shadows, and in which models the two
deviate from each other. We find that, given a compact and optically thin
emission region, our models allow for measurement of the black-hole shadow size
to an accuracy of 5%. We show that these conditions are generally met for all
MAD simulations we considered, as well as some of the SANE simulations.

fifth generation of communication networks (B5G), which incorporates the
advances in cloud computing technologies to modern radio access networks.
Recently, rate splitting multiple access (RSMA), relying on multi-antenna
rate-splitting (RS) at the transmitter and successive interference cancellation
(SIC) at the receivers, has been shown to manage the interference in
multi-antenna communication networks efficiently. This paper considers applying
RSMA in C-RAN. We address the practical challenge of a transmitter that only
knows the statistical channel state (CSI) information of the users. To this
end, the paper investigates the problem of stochastic coordinated beamforming
(SCB) optimization to maximize the ergodic sum-rate (ESR) in the network.
Furthermore, we propose a scalable and robust RS scheme where the number of the
common streams to be decoded at each user scales linearly with the number of
users, and the common stream selection only depends on the statistical CSI. The
setup leads to a challenging stochastic and non-convex optimization problem. A
sample average approximation (SAA) and weighted minimum mean square error
(WMMSE) based algorithm is adopted to tackle the intractable stochastic
non-convex optimization and guarantee convergence to a stationary point
asymptotically. The numerical simulations demonstrate the efficiency of the
proposed RS strategy and show a gain up to 27\% in the achievable ESR compared
with state-of-the-art schemes, namely treating interference as noise (TIN) and
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes.

studied using filtered camera images targeting three distinct wavelength
intervals. Through the tomographic SART procedure the high momentum, high pitch
angle part of the spatial and momentum distribution of these relativistic
particles is reconstructed. Experimental estimates of the distribution are
important for verification and refinement of formation-, decay- and
transport-models underlying runaway avoidance and mitigation strategy design.
Using a test distribution it is demonstrated that the inversion procedure
provides estimates accurate to within a few tens of percent in the region of
phase-space contributing most to the synchrotron image. We find that combining
images filtered around different parts of the emission spectrum widens the
probed part of momentum-space and reduces reconstruction errors. Next, the SART
algorithm is used to obtain information on the spatiotemporal runaway momentum
distribution in a selected TCV discharge. The momentum distribution is found to
relax towards an avalanche-like exponentially decaying profile. Anomalously
high pitch angles and a radial profile increasing towards the edge are found
for the most strongly emitting particles in the distribution. Pitch angle
scattering by toroidal magnetic field ripple is consistent with this picture.
An alternative explanation is the presence of high frequency instabilities in
combination with the formation of a runaway shell at the edge of the plasma.

in an end-to-end neural network manner, called directional automatic speech
recognition (D-ASR), which explicitly models source speaker locations. In
D-ASR, the azimuth angle of the sources with respect to the microphone array is
defined as a latent variable. This angle controls the quality of separation,
which in turn determines the ASR performance. All three functionalities of
D-ASR: localization, separation, and recognition are connected as a single
differentiable neural network and trained solely based on ASR error
minimization objectives. The advantages of D-ASR over existing methods are
threefold: (1) it provides explicit speaker locations, (2) it improves the
explainability factor, and (3) it achieves better ASR performance as the
process is more streamlined. In addition, D-ASR does not require explicit
direction of arrival (DOA) supervision like existing data-driven localization
models, which makes it more appropriate for realistic data. For the case of two
source mixtures, D-ASR achieves an average DOA prediction error of less than
three degrees. It also outperforms a strong far-field multi-speaker end-to-end
system in both separation quality and ASR performance.

an integrated learning framework that can simultaneously learn patients'

This learning framework is based on the measurement theory in psychiatry for
modeling multiple disease diagnostic measures as arising from the underlying

invariant structure for representing patients' latent mental states. A
multi-layer neural network is used to allow complex treatment effect

comparing their potential mental states under different treatments given the

compare favorably to alternative methods on heterogeneous treatment effects,
and have broad utilities which lead to better patient outcomes on multiple

the tracked tissue based on the spatial calibration. The real-time segmentation
result is evaluated both on a phantom and in-vivo on brachial arteries of

understood to arise from the dichroic extinction of that light by dust grains
whose axes are aligned with respect to a local magnetic-field. The size
distribution of the aligned-grain population can be constrained by measurements
of the wavelength dependence of the polarization. The leading physical model
for producing the alignment is radiative alignment-torques (RAT), which
predicts that the most efficiently aligned grains are those with sizes larger
than the wavelengths of light composing the local radiation field. Therefore,
for a given grain-size distribution, the wavelength at which the polarization
reaches a maximum ($\lambda_\mathrm{max}$) should correlate with the
characteristic reddening along the line of sight between the dust grains and
the illumination source. A correlation between $\lambda_\mathrm{max}$ and
reddening has been previously established for extinctions up to $A_V\approx4$
mag. We extend the study of this relationship to a larger sample of stars in
the Taurus cloud complex, including extinctions $A_V>10$ mag. We confirm the
earlier results for $A_V<4$ mag, but find that the $\lambda_\mathrm{max}$ vs.
$A_V$ relationship bifurcates above $A_V\approx4$ mag, with part of the sample
continuing the previously observed relationship and the remaining part
exhibiting a significantly steeper rise. We propose that the data exhibiting
the steep rise represent lines-of-sight towards high density ""clumps,"" where
grain coagulation has taken place. We present RAT-based modeling supporting
these hypotheses. These results indicate that multi-band OIR polarimetry is a
powerful tool for tracing grain growth in molecular clouds, independent of

forces, i.e. dynamical friction, acting on massive objects moving through a
self-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate, also known as a superfluid, at
finite temperatures. This is relevant for light scalar models of dark matter
with weak self-interactions that require nonzero temperatures, or that have
been heated inside galaxies. We derived expressions for dynamical friction
using linear perturbation theory, and compared these to numerical simulations
in which nonlinear effects are included. After testing the linear result, it
was applied to the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy, and two of its
gravitationally bound globular clusters. Dwarf spheroidals are well-suited for
indirectly probing properties of dark matter, and so by estimating the rate at
which these globular clusters are expected to sink into their host halo due to
dynamical friction, we inferred limits on the superfluid dark matter parameter
space. The dynamical friction in a finite-temperature superfluid is found to
behave very similarly to the zero-temperature limit, even when the thermal
contributions are large. However, when a critical velocity for the superfluid
flow is included, the friction force can transition from the zero-temperature
value to the value in a conventional fluid. Increasing the mass of the
perturbing object induces a similar transition to when lowering the critical
velocity. When applied to two of Fornax's globular clusters, we find that the
parameter space preferred in the literature for a zero-temperature superfluid
yields decay times that are in agreement with observations. However, the
present work suggests that increasing the temperature, which is expected to
change the preferred parameter space, may lead to very small decay times, and
therefore pose a problem for finite-temperature superfluid models of dark
matter.

Generalized Method of Moments. The asymptotic normality of the EHR estimator is
established, and it is shown that EHR is more efficient than HR. Moreover, EHR
is more efficient than ENV when the error distribution is heavy-tailed, while
maintaining a small efficiency loss when the error distribution is normal.

  Human Body Communication","Submitted to Transactions on Biomedical Engineering",,,,"eess.SP cs.SY eess.SY physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the advent of wearable technologies, Human Body Communication (HBC) has
emerged as a physically secure and power-efficient alternative to the otherwise
ubiquitous Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN). Whereas the most investigated
nodes of HBC have been Electric and Electro-quasistatic (EQS) Capacitive and
Galvanic, recently Magnetic HBC (M-HBC) has been proposed as a viable
alternative. Previous works have investigated M-HBC through an application
point of view, without developing a fundamental working principle for the same.
In this paper, for the first time, a ground up analysis has been performed to
study the possible effects and contributions of the human body channel in M-HBC
over a broad frequency range (1kHz to 10 GHz), by detailed electromagnetic
simulations and supporting experiments. The results show that while M-HBC can
be successfully operated as a body area network, the human body itself plays a
minimal or negligible role in it's functionality. For frequencies less than
about 30 MHz, in the domain of operation of Magneto-quasistatic (MQS) HBC, the
human body is transparent to the quasistatic magnetic field. Conversely for
higher frequencies, the conductive nature of human tissues end up attenuating
Magnetic HBC fields due to Eddy currents induced in body tissues, eliminating
the possibility of the body to support efficient waveguide modes. With this
better understanding at hand, different modes of operations of MQS HBC have
been outlined for both high impedance capacitive and 50 Ohm termination cases,
and their performances have been compared with EQS HBC for similar sized
devices, over varying distance between TX and RX. The resulting report presents
the first fundamental understanding towards M-HBC operation and its contrast
with EQS HBC, aiding HBC device designers to make educated design decisions,
depending on mode of applications.

to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation. Diagonal gates of the Clifford
hierarchy and 'nearly diagonal' semi-Clifford gates are particularly important:
they admit efficient gate teleportation protocols that implement these gates
with fewer ancillary quantum resources such as magic states. Despite the
practical importance of these sets of gates, many questions about their
structure remain open; this is especially true in the higher-dimensional qudit
setting. Our contribution is to leverage the discrete Stone-von Neumann theorem
and the symplectic formalism of qudit stabiliser mechanics towards extending
results of Zeng-Cheng-Chuang (2008) and Beigi-Shor (2010) to higher dimensions
in a uniform manner. We further give a simple algorithm for recursively
enumerating all gates of the Clifford hierarchy, a simple algorithm for
recognising and diagonalising semi-Clifford gates, and a concise proof of the
classification of the diagonal Clifford hierarchy gates due to
Cui-Gottesman-Krishna (2016) for the single-qudit case. We generalise the
efficient gate teleportation protocols of semi-Clifford gates to the qudit

dimension) and of two qutrits can be implemented efficiently. Numerical
evidence gathered via the aforementioned algorithms support the conjecture that
higher-level gates can be implemented efficiently.

first $k$ statistical moments match that of the full unitary group endowed with
the Haar measure. In prior work, we showed that the automorphism group of
classical $\mathbb{Z}_4$-linear Kerdock codes maps to a unitary $2$-design,
which established a new classical-quantum connection via graph states. In this
paper, we construct a Markov process that mixes this Kerdock $2$-design with
symplectic transvections, and show that this process produces an
$\epsilon$-approximate unitary $3$-design. We construct a graph whose vertices
are Pauli matrices, and two vertices are connected by directed edges if and
only if they commute. A unitary ensemble that is transitive on vertices, edges,
and non-edges of this Pauli graph is an exact $3$-design, and the stationary
distribution of our process possesses this property. With respect to the
symmetries of Kerdock codes, the Pauli graph has two types of edges; the
Kerdock $2$-design mixes edges of the same type, and the transvections mix the
types. More precisely, on $m$ qubits, the process samples
$O(\log(N^5/\epsilon))$ random transvections, where $N = 2^m$, followed by a
random Kerdock $2$-design element and a random Pauli matrix. Hence, the
simplicity of the protocol might make it attractive for several applications.
From a hardware perspective, $2$-qubit transvections exactly map to the
M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen gates that form the native $2$-qubit operations for
trapped-ion quantum computers. Thus, it might be possible to extend our work to
construct an approximate $3$-design that only involves such $2$-qubit
transvections.

typical microflares [$\sim$($10^{27}$-$10^{30}$) erg] are prone to drive slow
shock waves that induce slow mode patterns. The slow mode features are obtained
for every tested local energy deposition inside the loop. Meanwhile, to obtain
an observable sausage mode pattern a global perturbation, capable to modify
instantaneously the internal loop temperature, is required, i.e. the
characteristic conductive heating time must be much smaller than the radiative
cooling one. Experiments carried out by varying parameter $\beta$ show us that
the excitation of sausage modes does not depend significantly on the value of
this parameter but on the global or local character of the energy source.

satisfactory pixel-level predictions on the target with only out-of-domain

discrepancy between source and target to enable effective knowledge transfer.
Previous domain discrepancy minimization methods are mainly based on the
adversarial training. They tend to consider the domain discrepancy globally,
which ignore the pixel-wise relationships and are less discriminative. In this
paper, we propose to build the pixel-level cycle association between source and
target pixel pairs and contrastively strengthen their connections to diminish
the domain gap and make the features more discriminative. To the best of our
knowledge, this is a new perspective for tackling such a challenging task.
Experiment results on two representative domain adaptation benchmarks, i.e.
GTAV $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes and SYNTHIA $\rightarrow$ Cityscapes, verify the
effectiveness of our proposed method and demonstrate that our method performs
favorably against previous state-of-the-arts. Our method can be trained
end-to-end in one stage and introduces no additional parameters, which is
expected to serve as a general framework and help ease future research in

comparative analysis is drawn across two different types of feature aggregation
to explore the vast possibilities surrounding feature fusion. Using a dataset

requires dark phases, which were assumed to be amorphous carbon and/or
magnetite (~80 wt.%). In contrast, the Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector (GRaND)
constrained the abundances of C (8-14 wt.%) and Fe (15-17 wt.%). Here, we
reconcile the VIR-derived mineral composition with the GRaND-derived elemental
composition. First, we model mineral abundances from VIR data, including either
meteorite-derived insoluble organic matter, amorphous carbon, magnetite, or
combination as the darkening agent and provide statistically rigorous error
bars from a Bayesian algorithm combined with a radiative-transfer model.
Elemental abundances of C and Fe are much higher than is suggested by the GRaND
observations for all models satisfying VIR data. We then show that radiative
transfer modeling predicts higher reflectance from a carbonaceous chondrite of
known composition than its measured reflectance. Consequently, our second
models use multiple carbonaceous chondrite endmembers, allowing for the
possibility that their specific textures or minerals other than carbon or
magnetite act as darkening agents, including sulfides and tochilinite. Unmixing
models with carbonaceous chondrites eliminate the discrepancy in elemental
abundances of C and Fe. Ceres' average reflectance spectrum and elemental
abundances are best reproduced by carbonaceous-chondrite-like materials (40-70

guarantee the stable recovery, such that a huge amount of frames are generated,
and thus it poses a great demand of parallel computing in order to solve this
large-scale inverse problem. In this paper, we propose the overlapping Domain
Decomposition Methods(DDMs) to solve the nonconvex optimization problem in
ptychographic imaging. They decouple the problem defined on the whole domain
into subproblems only defined on the subdomains with synchronizing information
in the overlapping regions of these subdomains,thus leading to highly parallel
algorithms with good load balance. More specifically, for the nonblind recovery
(with known probe in advance), by enforcing the continuity of the overlapping
regions for the image (sample), the nonlinear optimization model is established
based on a novel smooth-truncated amplitude-Gaussian metric (ST-AGM). Such
metric allows for fast calculation of the proximal mapping with closed form,
and meanwhile provides the possibility for the convergence guarantee of the
first-order nonconvex optimization algorithm due to its Lipschitz smoothness.
Then the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is utilized to
generate an efficient Overlapping Domain Decomposition based Ptychography
algorithm(OD2P) for the two-subdomain domain decomposition (DD), where all
subproblems can be computed with close-form solutions.Due to the Lipschitz
continuity for the gradient of the objective function with ST-AGM, the
convergence of the proposed OD2P is derived under mild conditions. Moreover, it
is extended to more general case including multiple-subdomain DD and blind
recovery. Numerical experiments are further conducted to show the performance
of proposed algorithms, demonstrating good convergence speed and robustness to
the noise.

of the same sound cause behavioural distraction. Recent work has suggested that
distraction also occurs during reading as fixation durations increased when a
deviant sound was presented at the fixation onset of words. The present study
tested the hypothesis that this increase in fixation durations occurs due to
saccadic inhibition. This was done by manipulating the temporal onset of sounds
relative to the fixation onset of words in the text. If novel sounds cause
saccadic inhibition, they should be more distracting when presented during the
second half of fixations when saccade programming usually takes place.
Participants read single sentences and heard a 120 ms sound when they fixated
five target words in the sentence. On most occasions (p= 0.9), the same sine
wave tone was presented (""standard""), while on the remaining occasions (p= 0.1)
a new sound was presented (""novel""). Critically, sounds were played either
during the first half of the fixation (0 ms delay) or during the second half of
the fixation (120 ms delay). Consistent with the saccadic inhibition
hypothesis, novel sounds led to longer fixation durations in the 120 ms
compared to the 0 ms delay condition. However, novel sounds did not generally
influence the execution of the subsequent saccade. These results suggest that
unexpected sounds have a rapid influence on saccade planning, but not saccade
execution.

FireCommander game, a team of agents must be tasked to optimally deal with a

can accomplish their mission by first sensing (e.g., estimating fire states),
communicating the sensed fire-information among each other and then taking
action to put the firespots out based on the sensed information (e.g., dropping
water on estimated fire locations). The FireCommander environment can be useful
for research topics spanning a wide range of applications from Reinforcement

Psychology, Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) and Teaming. There are four important
facets of the FireCommander environment that overall, create a non-trivial

(2)Probabilistic Environment: Agents' actions result in probabilistic

born out of topological correlations, and is oblivious of low-sample quality.
It was envisioned to lead towards dissipationless and topologically protected
electronics. However, no clear framework of how to design such an electronic
device out of it exists. Here we construct an ultra-low power, non-volatile,
cryogenic memory architecture leveraging the QAHE phenomenon. Our design
promises orders of magnitude lower cell area compared with the state-of-the-art
cryogenic memory technologies. We harness the fundamentally quantized Hall
resistance levels in moir\'e graphene heterostructures to store non-volatile
binary bits (1, 0). We perform the memory write operation through controlled
hysteretic switching between the quantized Hall states, using nano-ampere level
currents with opposite polarities. The non-destructive read operation is
performed by sensing the polarity of the transverse Hall voltage using a
separate pair of terminals. We custom design the memory architecture with a
novel sensing mechanism to avoid accidental data corruption, ensure highest
memory density and minimize array leakage power. Our design is transferrable to
any material platform exhibiting QAHE, and provides a pathway towards realizing
topologically protected memory devices.

produced by the mutual interference of laser light on object's surface and

Chem. Theory Comput. 2019, 15, 5965-5986), while highly successful in terms of
improving convergence, was not competitive to conventional orbital-based SAPT
in terms of computational efficiency due to the need to manipulate several
kinds of two-electron integrals. In this work, we eliminate this need by
decomposing all types of two-electron integrals using robust density fitting.
We demonstrate that the error of the density fitting approximation is
negligible when standard auxiliary bases such as aug-cc-pVXZ/MP2FIT are
employed. The new implementation allowed us to study all complexes in the A24
database in basis sets up to aug-cc-pV5Z, and the $E^{(20)}_{\rm disp}$-F12 and
$E^{(20)}_{\rm exch-disp}$-F12 values exhibit vastly improvement basis set
convergence over their conventional counterparts. The well-converged
$E^{(20)}_{\rm disp}$-F12 and $E^{(20)}_{\rm exch-disp}$-F12 numbers can be
substituted for conventional $E^{(20)}_{\rm disp}$ and $E^{(20)}_{\rm
exch-disp}$ ones in a calculation of the total SAPT interaction energy at any
level (SAPT0, SAPT2+3, ...). We show that the addition of F12 terms does not
improve the accuracy of low-level SAPT treatments. However, when the theory
errors are minimized in high-level SAPT approaches such as
SAPT2+3(CCD)$\delta$MP2, the reduction of basis set incompleteness errors
thanks to the F12 treatment substantially improves the accuracy of small-basis
calculations.

the development of broadband, high quantum efficiency, room temperature SPS

development of all-optical quantum communication platforms. In this regard
deterministic coupling of SPS to plasmonic nanocavity arrays has great
advantage due to long propagation length and delocalized nature of surface
lattice resonances (SLRs). Guided by these considerations, we report
experiments on the room temperature tunable coupling of single photon emitting
colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) to localised and delocalised modes in plasmonic
nanocavity arrays. Using time-resolved photo-luminescence measurement on
isolated CQD, we report significant advantage of SLRs in realizing much higher
Purcell effect, despite large dephasing of CQDs, with values of ~22 and ~ 6 for
coupling to the lattice and localised modes, respectively. We present
measurements on the antibunching of CQDs coupled to these modes with g(2)(0)
values in quantum domain providing evidence for an effective cooperative
behavior. We present a density matrix treatment of the coupling of CQDs to
plasmonic and lattice modes enabling us to model the experimental results on
Purcell factors as well as on the antibunching. We also provide experimental
evidence of indirect excitation of remote CQDs mediated by the lattice modes
and propose a model to explain these observations. Our study demonstrates the
possibility of developing nanophotonic platforms for single photon operations

Usually, the number of labeled data is limited and most data available are

unlabeled data, which significantly limits the improvement of fault diagnosis
performance in chiller systems. To make effective use of unlabeled data to
further improve fault diagnosis performance and reduce the dependency on

method for chiller systems based on the semi-generative adversarial network,
which incorporates both unlabeled and labeled data into learning process. The
semi-generative adversarial network can learn the information of data

improve the diagnostic performance. Experimental results demonstrate the

driven by usual on-site charge fluctuations, which are realized in a rather
high-energy region and yield plasmon excitations. On the other hand, the
low-energy region with the scale of the superexchange interaction J is
dominated by bond-charge fluctuations. Surprisingly, compared with the effect

errors manifest as rotations about a particular axis and can accumulate over

requiring the noise to preserve the code space of a stabilizer code, and to act
as the logical identity operator on the protected information. Thus, we develop
necessary and sufficient conditions for all transversal $Z$-rotations to
preserve the code space of a stabilizer code, which require the weight-$2$
$Z$-stabilizers to cover all the qubits that are in the support of some
$X$-component. Further, the weight-$2$ $Z$-stabilizers generate a direct
product of single-parity-check codes with even block length. By adjusting the
size of these components, we are able to construct a large family of QECC
codes, oblivious to coherent noise, that includes the $[[4L^2, 1, 2L]]$ Shor
codes. Moreover, given $M$ even and any $[[n,k,d]]$ stabilizer code, we can
construct an $[[Mn, k, \ge d]]$ stabilizer code that is oblivious to coherent
noise.
  If we require that transversal $Z$-rotations preserve the code space only up
to some finite level $l$ in the Clifford hierarchy, then we can construct
higher level gates necessary for universal quantum computation. The
$Z$-stabilizers supported on each non-zero $X$-component form a classical
binary code C, which is required to contain a self-dual code, and the classical
Gleason's theorem constrains its weight enumerator. The conditions for a
stabilizer code being preserved by transversal $2\pi/2^l$ $Z$-rotations at $4

We analyze both perturbative and non-perturbative corrections to the

will modify the relation between the entropy and area of these black branes.
This will in turn modify their specific heat, and thus their stability. So,
such corrections can have important consequences for the stability of black
branes at quantum scales. We also analyze the effect of these perturbative and

behaviors of physical observables as functions of time. When a system is
subject to time-periodic modulations, the nonanalytic signatures of its
observables could recur periodically in time, leading to the phenomena of
Floquet DQPTs. In this work, we systematically explore Floquet DQPTs in a class
of periodically quenched one-dimensional system with chiral symmetry. By tuning
the strength of quench, we find multiple Floquet DQPTs within a single driving
period, with more DQPTs being observed when the system is initialized in
Floquet states with larger topological invariants. Each Floquet DQPT is further
accompanied by the quantized jump of a dynamical topological order parameter,
whose values remain quantized in time if the underlying Floquet system is
prepared in a gapped topological phase. The theory is demonstrated in a
piecewise quenched lattice model, which possesses rich Floquet topological
phases and is readily realizable in quantum simulators like the
nitrogen-vacancy center in diamonds. Our discoveries thus open a new
perspective for the Floquet engineering of DQPTs and the dynamical detection of
topological phase transitions in Floquet systems.

structural damage. The magnitude of those forces corresponds to the range below
covalent bond scission (from 200 pN to several nN) and above thermal
fluctuation (several pN). Here, we report a conformationally flexible
dual-fluorescence force probe with a theoretically estimated threshold of
approximately 100 pN. This probe enables ratiometric analysis of the

changing the intrinsic properties of the polymer, the force distribution was

demonstrated that the local stress concentration is twice as biased at

Due to the high sensitivity, the percentage of stressed force probes was
estimated to be more than 1000 times higher than the activation rate of a

crowded correlated cell-free massive MIMO-OFDM systems with limited number of

based on non-orthogonal pilot phase shift hopping patterns and non-orthogonal
adjustable phase shift pilots (APSP). We derive a closed-form expression of
mean square error of channel estimation (MSE-CE) and obtain an optimal
condition for minimizing MSE-CE. According to this condition, the APSP set
allocation scheme is proposed. Furthermore, for the data transmission, the
max-min power control algorithm is devised to maximize the minimum spectral

significant performance gains in terms of MSE-CE for the proposed APSP set

extensively studying the phenomena in quantum physics. Quantum coherence, a
quantum resource, is the basic ingredient in many quantum information tasks. It
is a subject of broad and current interest in quantum information, and many new
concepts have been introduced and generalized since its establishment. Here we
show that the block coherence can be transformed into entanglement via a block
incoherent operation. Moreover, we find that the POVM-based coherence
associated with block coherence through the Naimark extension acts as a
potential resource from the perspective of generating entanglement. Finally, we
discuss avenues of creating entanglement from POVM-based coherence, present
strategies that require embedding channels and auxiliary systems, give some
examples, and generalize them.

two-dimensional excitonic complexes, and form an excellent platform for probing
many-body physics through manipulation of Coulomb interaction. Quantum confined
Stark effect is one of the routes to dynamically tune the emission line of
these excitonic complexes. In this work, using a high quality
graphene/hBN/WS$_2$/hBN/Au vertical heterojunction, we demonstrate for the
first time, an out-of-plane electric field driven change in the sign of the
Stark shift from blue to red for four different excitonic species, namely, the
neutral exciton, the charged exciton (trion), the charged biexciton, and the
defect-bound exciton. Such universal non-monotonic Stark shift with electric
field arises from a competition between the conventional quantum confined Stark
effect driven red shift and a suppressed binding energy driven anomalous blue
shift of the emission lines, with the latter dominating in the low field
regime. We also find that the encapsulating environment of the monolayer TMDC
plays an important role in wave function spreading, and hence in determining
the magnitude of the blue Stark shift. The results for neutral and charged
excitonic species are in excellent agreement with calculations from
Bethe-Salpeter Equation that uses seven-band per spin tight binding
Hamiltonian. The findings have important implications in probing many-body
interaction in the two dimension as well as in developing layered semiconductor
based tunable optoelectronic devices.

new scholarly databases, such as Dimensions, have come up. Several previous
studies have compared different databases, either through a direct comparison
of article coverage or by comparing the citations across the databases. This
article attempts to compare the journal coverage of the three databases: Web of
Science, Scopus and Dimensions. The most recent master journal lists of the
three databases have been used for the purpose of identifying the overlapping
and unique journals covered in the databases. The results indicate that the
databases have significantly different journal coverage, with the Web of
Science being most selective and Dimensions being the most exhaustive. About
99.11% and 96.61% of the journals indexed in Web of Science are also indexed in
Scopus and Dimensions, respectively. Scopus has 96.42% of its indexed journals
also covered by Dimensions. Dimensions database has the most exhaustive
coverage, with 82.22% more journals covered as compared to Web of Science and
48.17% more journals covered as compared to Scopus. We also analysed the
research outputs for 20 highly productive countries for the 2010-2019 period,

in research output volume, rank and global share of different countries. In
addition to variations in overall coverage of research output from different

side and use list decoding on the decoding side to improve the finite-length
performance of the AMP decoder for SPARCs over complex AWGN channels.
Simulation results show that such a concatenated coding scheme works much
better than SPARCs with the original AMP decoder and results in a steep
waterfall-like behavior in the bit-error rate performance curves. Furthermore,
we apply our proposed concatenated coding scheme to spatially coupled SPARCs.
Besides that, we also introduce a novel class of design matrices, i.e.,
matrices that describe the encoding process, based on circulant matrices
derived from Frank or from Milewski sequences. This class of design matrices
has comparable encoding and decoding computational complexity as well as very
close performance with the commonly-used class of design matrices based on
discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrices, but gives us more degrees of freedom
when designing SPARCs for various applications.

$e^{\pm}$ from the background of a reaction rate of an order of 10 MHz, the
data acquisition (DAQ) system uses waveform sampling chips of APV25 and DRS4.
The trigger rate and data rate are expected to be 1 kHz and 130--330 MiB/s,
respectively. The DAQ system for readout of APV25 and DRS4 were developed,
where events were synchronized by common trigger and tag data. The first
commissioning in beam, called Run-0a, was performed in June 2020 with about 1/4

Method: Action research to elaborate relevant stakeholders for release planning
was conducted at Dr. Ing. h. c. F. Porsche AG. Results: We present a detailed
overview of identified stakeholders due to release planning as well as their
required content and added value regarding to two pilot projects. The results
confirm the fact that almost every stakeholder is involved in a release plan in

discuss how the presented stakeholders could meet with the given conditions in
the automotive domain. With this contribution, identified stakeholders of
release planning from hardware and software point of view is introduced. It

are taken into account: one scenario has both average and peak optical

intensity constraint. For both two scenarios, we derive closed-from expressions
of capacity lower and upper bounds. Specifically, the capacity lower bound is
derived by using the variational method and the property that the output

is obtained by utilizing the dual expression of capacity and the principle of

the asymptotic analysis shows that the asymptotic performance gap between the

million solar masses; in this work we investigate the properties of early DSs
with masses up to $\sim \! 1000 \, M_\odot$, fueled by WIMPS weighing $100$
GeV. We improve the previous implementation of the DM energy source into the
stellar evolution code MESA. We show that the growth of DSs is not limited by
astrophysical effects: DSs up to $\sim \! 1000 \, M_\odot$ exhibit no dynamical
instabilities; DSs are not subject to mass-loss driven by super-Eddington
winds. We test the assumption of previous work that the injected energy per
WIMP annihilation is constant throughout the star; relaxing this assumption
does not change the properties of the DSs. Furthermore, we study DS pulsations,
for the first time investigating non-adiabatic pulsation modes, using the
linear pulsation code GYRE. We find that acoustic modes in DSs of masses
smaller than $\sim \! 200 \, M_\odot$ are excited by the $\kappa-\gamma$ and
$\gamma$ mechanism in layers where hydrogen or helium is (partially) ionized.
Moreover, we show that the mass-loss rates potentially induced by pulsations
are negligible compared to the accretion rates.

processes with jump kernels decaying at the boundary. To be more precise, we
consider processes in ${\mathbb R}^d_+$ with jump kernels of the form
${\mathcal B}(x,y) |x-y|^{-d-\alpha}$ and killing potentials
$\kappa(x)=cx_d^{-\alpha}$, $0<\alpha<2$. The boundary part ${\mathcal B}(x,y)$
is comparable to the product of three terms with parameters $\beta_1, \beta_2$,
$\beta_3$ and $\beta_4$ appearing as exponents in these terms. The constant $c$
in the killing term can be written as a function of $\alpha$, ${\mathcal B}$
and a parameter $p\in ((\alpha-1)_+, \alpha+\beta_1)$, which is strictly
increasing in $p,$ decreasing to $0$ as $p\downarrow (\alpha-1)_+$ and
increasing to $\infty$ as $p\uparrow\alpha+\beta_1$. We establish sharp
two-sided estimates on the Green functions of these processes for all $p\in
((\alpha-1)_+, \alpha+\beta_1)$ and all admissible values of $\beta_1,
\beta_2$, $\beta_3$ and $\beta_4$. Depending on the regions where $\beta_1$,
$\beta_2$ and $p$ belong, the estimates on the Green functions are different.
In fact, the estimates have three different forms depending on the regions the
parameters belong to. As applications, we prove that the boundary Harnack
principle holds in certain region of the parameters and fails in some other
region of the parameters. Combined with the main results of \cite{KSV},we
completely determine the region of the parameters where the boundary Harnack
principle holds.

physical research. Modeling of the linearized control response of plasma shape
and position has been widely used for shape controller design in the last
several years. But it usually contains much of the uncertainty, such as
structured uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. EAST tokamak plasma shape
controller design is also based on a linear rigid plasma response model which
integrated within a Matlab-based toolset known as TokSys. Meanwhile the PID
control approach is currently used for EAST plasma shape control. This leads to
strong coupling between different parameters describing the plasma shape. To
handle these problems, a H_infinity robust control scheme for EAST multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) shape control has been proposed. First, the plasma response
is modeled as the linearized rigid RZIp model. Then, the controller design
technique is introduced with two main stages: 1) loop shaping is used to shape
the nominal plant singular values to give desired open-loop properties at
frequencies of high and low loop gain; 2) a normalized coprime factorization
and H_infinity technique is used to decouple the most relevant control channels
and minimize the tracking errors. Finally, the simulation results show that the
H_infinity robust controller combines good robust stability margins, speed of
response, dynamic tracking characteristics, and closed-loop decoupling for EAST
plasma shape control.

this level of caching involves the manual implementation by developers and is
typically addressed in an ad-hoc way, given that it depends on specific details
of the application. As a result, application-level caching is a time-consuming
and error-prone task, becoming a common source of bugs. Furthermore, it forces
application developers to reason about a crosscutting concern, which is
unrelated to the application business logic. In this paper, we present the
results of a qualitative study of how developers handle caching logic in their

the simplifying assumption that all cores execute the same loop can not be
upheld. Motivated by observations on plain and modified versions of the HPCG
benchmark, we construct a performance model of execution of memory-bound loop
kernels. It can predict the memory bandwidth share per kernel on a memory
contention domain depending on the number of active cores and which other
workload the kernel is paired with. The only code features required are the
single-thread cache line access frequency per kernel, which is directly related
to the single-thread memory bandwidth, and its saturated bandwidth. It can
either be measured directly or predicted using the Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM)
performance model. The computational intensity of the kernels and the detailed
structure of the code is of no significance. We validate our model on Intel
Broadwell, Intel Cascade Lake, and AMD Rome processors pairing various
streaming and stencil kernels. The error in predicting the bandwidth share per

embeddings can encode social biases present in the training data which can
affect minorities in real world applications. This paper explores the gender
bias implicit in Dutch embeddings while investigating whether English language
based approaches can also be used in Dutch. We implement the Word Embeddings
Association Test (WEAT), Clustering and Sentence Embeddings Association Test
(SEAT) methods to quantify the gender bias in Dutch word embeddings, then we
proceed to reduce the bias with Hard-Debias and Sent-Debias mitigation methods
and finally we evaluate the performance of the debiased embeddings in
downstream tasks. The results suggest that, among others, gender bias is
present in traditional and contextualized Dutch word embeddings. We highlight
how techniques used to measure and reduce bias created for English can be used
in Dutch embeddings by adequately translating the data and taking into account
the unique characteristics of the language. Furthermore, we analyze the effect
of the debiasing techniques on downstream tasks which show a negligible impact
on traditional embeddings and a 2% decrease in performance in contextualized
embeddings. Finally, we release the translated Dutch datasets to the public
along with the traditional embeddings with mitigated bias.

anaphoric reference has greatly improved, more attention is devoted to more
complex aspects of anaphora. One limitation of virtually all coreference
resolution models is the focus on single-antecedent anaphors. Plural anaphors
with multiple antecedents-so-called split-antecedent anaphors (as in John met
Mary. They went to the movies) have not been widely studied, because they are
not annotated in ONTONOTES and are relatively infrequent in other corpora. In
this paper, we introduce the first model for unrestricted resolution of
split-antecedent anaphors. We start with a strong baseline enhanced by BERT
embeddings, and show that we can substantially improve its performance by
addressing the sparsity issue. To do this, we experiment with auxiliary corpora
where split-antecedent anaphors were annotated by the crowd, and with transfer
learning models using element-of bridging references and single-antecedent
coreference as auxiliary tasks. Evaluation on the gold annotated ARRAU corpus
shows that the out best model uses a combination of three auxiliary corpora

a critical issue in web applications. Recently, latency and cost of
Internet-based services are encouraging the use of application-level caching to
continue satisfying users' demands and improve the scalability and availability
of origin servers. Application-level caching, in which developers manually
control cached content, has been adopted when traditional forms of caching are
insufficient to meet such requirements. Despite its popularity, this level of
caching is typically addressed in an ad hoc way, given that it depends on
specific details of the application. Furthermore, it forces application
developers to reason about a crosscutting concern, which is unrelated to the
application business logic. As a result, application-level caching is a
time-consuming and error-prone task, becoming a common source of bugs. Among
all the issues involved with application-level caching, the decision of what
should be cached must frequently be adjusted to cope with the application
evolution and usage, making it a challenging task. In this paper, we introduce
an automated caching approach to automatically identify application-level cache
content at runtime by monitoring system execution and adaptively managing
caching decisions. Our approach is implemented as a framework that can be
seamlessly integrated into new and existing web applications. In addition to
the reduction of the effort required from developers to develop a caching
solution, an empirical evaluation showed that our approach significantly speeds
up and improves hit ratios with improvements ranging from 2.78% to 17.18%.

However, they often execute with significantly more privilege than needed to

Mir addresses this problem by introducing a fine-grained read-write-execute
(RWX) permission model at the boundaries of libraries. Every field of an
imported library is governed by a set of permissions, which developers can
express when importing libraries. To enforce these permissions during program
execution, Mir transforms libraries and their context to add runtime checks. As
permissions can overwhelm developers, Mir's permission inference generates
default permissions by analyzing how libraries are used by their consumers.
Applied to 50 popular libraries, Mir's prototype for JavaScript demonstrates
that the RWX permission model combines simplicity with power: it is simple
enough to automatically infer 99.33% of required permissions, it is expressive
enough to defend against 16 real threats, it is efficient enough to be usable
in practice (1.93% overhead), and it enables a novel quantification of

different timescales with the aim to investigate whether this variability is
similar to that observed in FU Ori. We observed V646 Pup at the SAAO and CTIO
between 2013 and 2018 with Johnson and Sloan filters, typically using a one-day
cadence maintained for 1-4 weeks. We also utilised the public-domain
1512-day-long ASAS-SN light curve and TESS photometry obtained in 2019 over
24.1 days with a 30 min cadence. New SAAO low-resolution spectra assist in
updating major disc parameters, while the archival high-resolution Keck spectra
are used to search for temporal changes in the disc rotational profiles. The
ground-based observations confirm the constantly decreasing brightness of V646
Pup at the rate of 0.018 mag/yr. Precise TESS data show that the slight,
0.005-0.01 mag, light variations imposed on this general trend do consist of a
few independent wave trains of an apparently time-coherent nature. Assuming
that this is typical situation, based on an analysis of colour-magnitude
diagrams obtained for earlier epochs, we were able to make a preliminarily
inference that the bulk of the light changes observed could be due to the
rotation of disc photosphere inhomogeneities, arising between 10-12 solar radii
from the star. We do not exclude the possibility that these inhomogeneities
could also manifest themselves in the rotational profiles of the disc, as
obtained from the high-resolution spectra. Assuming Keplerian rotation of these
inhomogeneities, we give a preliminary determination of the stellar mass at
0.7-0.9 solar mass. These preliminary results are similar to those better
established for FU Ori, which suggests a common driving mechanism(s).

one week from the moment of the extinction of a conditioned reflex, which could
be explained by the chosen paradigm of conditioned reflex with partial

study physical models of basic bulk circuit elements -- capacitors, inductors,

their effects in the case of periodical time modulations. We develop a solid
theory for understanding these elements, and apply it to two important
applications: wireless power transfer and antennas. For the first application,
we show that by periodically modulating the mutual inductance between the
transmitter and receiver, the fundamental limits of classical wireless power
transfer systems can be overcome. Regarding the second application, we consider
a time-varying source for electrically small dipole antennas and show how time
modulation can enhance the antenna performance. The developed theory of
electromagnetic systems engineered by temporal modulation is applicable from
radio frequencies to optical wavelengths.

governments worldwide to establish social distancing measures. Consequently,
people had to switch to online media, such as social networks or
videotelephony, to keep in touch with friends and family. In this context,
online games, combining entertainment with social interactions, also
experienced a notable growth. In our work, we focused on the potential of games
as a replacement for social contacts in the COVID-19 crisis. Our online survey
results indicate that the value of games for social needs depends on individual
gaming habits. Participants playing mostly multiplayer games increased their
playtime and mentioned social play as a key motivator. Contrarily, non-players
were not motivated to add games as communication channels. We deduce that such
crises mainly catalyze existing gaming habits.

  Face Recognition","10pages, 3figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Knowledge Distillation (KD) refers to transferring knowledge from a large
model to a smaller one, which is widely used to enhance model performance in
machine learning. It tries to align embedding spaces generated from the teacher
and the student model (i.e. to make images corresponding to the same semantics
share the same embedding across different models). In this work, we focus on
its application in face recognition. We observe that existing knowledge
distillation models optimize the proxy tasks that force the student to mimic
the teacher's behavior, instead of directly optimizing the face recognition
accuracy. Consequently, the obtained student models are not guaranteed to be
optimal on the target task or able to benefit from advanced constraints, such
as large margin constraints (e.g. margin-based softmax). We then propose a
novel method named ProxylessKD that directly optimizes face recognition
accuracy by inheriting the teacher's classifier as the student's classifier to
guide the student to learn discriminative embeddings in the teacher's embedding
space. The proposed ProxylessKD is very easy to implement and sufficiently
generic to be extended to other tasks beyond face recognition. We conduct
extensive experiments on standard face recognition benchmarks, and the results
demonstrate that ProxylessKD achieves superior performance over existing
knowledge distillation methods.

in unprecedented restrictions on personal and work-related travels in various
nations across the globe. As a consequence, economic activities within and
across the countries were almost halted. As restrictions loosen and cities
start to resume public and private transport to revamp the economy, it becomes
critical to assess the commuters' travel-related risk in light of the ongoing
pandemic. We develop a generalizable quantitative framework to evaluate the
commute-related risk arising from inter-district and intra-district travels by
combining Nonparametric Data Envelopment analysis for vulnerability assessment
with transportation network analysis. We demonstrate the application of the
proposed model for establishing travel corridors or travel bubbles within and
across Gujarat and Maharashtra, two Indian states that have reported many
SARS-CoV2 cases since early April 2020. Our findings suggest that establishing
the travel bubble between a pair of districts solely based on the health
vulnerability indices of origin-destination discards the en-route travel risks
due to prevalent pandemic, hence underestimating the threat. For example, while
the resultant of social and health vulnerabilities of Narmada and Vadodara's
districts is relatively moderate, the en-route travel risk exacerbates the
overall travel risk. Our study provides actionable insights to users into
choosing the alternate path with the least risk and can inform political
decisions to establish low-risk travel corridors within and across the states
while accounting for social and health vulnerabilities in addition to
transit-time related risks.

epitaxy. Remarkably, the QGS emerges under both perpendicular and parallel
magnetic field in 4-monolayer PdTe2 films. The direct activated scaling
analysis with a new irrelevant correction has been proposed, providing
important evidence of QGS. With increasing film thickness to 6 monolayers, the
QGS disappears under perpendicular field but persists under parallel field, and
this discordance may originate from the differences in microscopic processes.
Our work demonstrates the universality of parallel field induced QGS and can
stimulate further investigations on novel quantum phase transitions under

constructive, univalent type theory. The focus is on placing computability into
a larger mathematical context, rather than on a complete development of
computability theory. We begin with a treatment of partial functions, using the
notion of dominance, which is used in synthetic domain theory to discuss
classes of partial maps. We relate this and other ideas from synthetic domain
theory to other approaches to partiality in type theory. We show that the
notion of dominance is difficult to apply in our setting: the set of
$\Sigma_0^1$ propositions investigated by Rosolini form a dominance precisely
if a weak, but nevertheless unprovable, choice principle holds. To get around
this problem, we suggest an alternative notion of partial function we call
disciplined maps. In the presence of countable choice, this notion coincides
with Rosolini's.
  Using a general notion of partial function, we take the first steps in
constructive computability theory. We do this both with computability as
structure, where we have direct access to programs; and with computability as
property, where we must work in a program-invariant way. We demonstrate the
difference between these two approaches by showing how these approaches relate
to facts about computability theory arising from topos-theoretic and
type-theoretic concerns. Finally, we tie the two threads together: assuming
countable choice and that all total functions $\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ are
computable (both of which hold in the effective topos), the Rosolini partial
functions, the disciplined maps, and the computable partial functions all
coincide. We observe, however, that the class of all partial functions includes
non-computable partial functions.

depth at 2.75 {\mu}m and 2.80 {\mu}m that shows a correlation with [H2O] in the
sample determined by TGA, though with a high uncertainty (4 wt% H2O). This
relation is used to determine water content at the surface of large C-complex
main-belt asteroids and discuss the origin of the variability found. On average
C-complex Main-Belt Asteroids (MBA) have water contents of 4.5 wt% (volume
average, (1) Ceres excluded), significantly lower than average CM chondrites.
The estimated water content for the most hydrated asteroids are lower than
those of the most hydrated meteorites, a difference that could be attributed to
space-weathering. An anti-correlation is also present between water content and
overall spectral slope, which is opposite to expectation from laboratory
simulations of space weathering on dark carbonaceous chondrites. This suggests
that part of the variability in the surface hydration among the different
C-complex asteroids is not due to space-weathering, but to the composition of
surface material. When applied to Ceres, the hygrometer presented in this work
enables us to estimate that at least 1.22 wt% of the hydrogen is present in the
form of organics. This richness in organics strengthens the connection between

the discontinuous matrix-valued operator satisfies a uniform matrix

observed the maser emission of R Crt and RT Vir for more than two decades. To

circumstellar envelopes, we have collected interferometric data, taken in the
same period, from the literature.
  We confirm short-time variations of individual maser features on timescales
of months to up to 1.5 years. Also decade-long variations of the general
brightness level independent from individual features were seen in both stars.
These are due to brightness variations occurring independently from each other
in selected velocity ranges, and are independent of the optical lightcurves.
Expected drifts in velocity of individual features are usually masked by
blending. However, in RT Vir we found an exceptional case of a feature with a
constant velocity over 7.5 years (<0.06 km/s/yr).
  We attribute the long-term brightness variations to the presence of regions
with higher-than-average density in the stellar wind, which host several clouds
which emit maser radiation on the short time scales. These regions typically
need ~20 years to cross the H2O maser shell, where the right conditions to
excite H2O masers are present. The constant velocity feature (11 km/s) is
likely to come from a single maser cloud, which moved through about half of RT
Vir's H2O maser shell without changing velocity. From this we infer that its
path was located in the outer part of the H2O maser shell, where RT Vir's
stellar wind apparently has already reached its terminal outflow velocity. This
conclusion is corroborated by the observation that the highest H2O maser
outflow velocity in RT Vir approaches the terminal outflow velocity as given by
OH and CO observations. This is generally not observed in other semi-regular
variable stars.

in a lattice and embedded in gases of free neutrons and electrons. We describe
the system within the Wigner-Seitz (WS) cell approximation. The nuclear energy
is calculated using Skyrme model with SkM* interaction. To isolate the
properties of nuclei we follow the subtraction procedure presented by Bonche,
Levit and Vautherin, within the Thomas-Fermi approximation. We obtain the
equilibrium properties of inner crust for various density, temperatures and
magnetic fields by minimizing the free energy of the WS cell satisfying the
charge neutrality and $\beta-$equilibrium conditions. We infer that at a fixed
baryon density and temperature, strong quantizing magnetic field reduces the
cell radii, neutron and proton numbers in the cell compared with the field free
case. However, the nucleon number in the nucleus increases in presence of
magnetic field. The free energy per nucleon also decreases in magnetized inner
crust. On the other hand, we find that finite temperature tends to smear out
the effects of magnetic field. Our results can be important in the context of
$r-$process nucleosynthesis in the binary neutron star mergers.

generation due to a stimulus input. Commonly, neuronal excitability is divided
into two classes: Type I and Type II, both having different properties that
affect information processing, such as thresholding and gain scaling. These
properties can be mathematically studied using generalised phenomenological
models, such as the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model and the mirrored FHN. The FHN model
shows that each excitability type corresponds to one specific type of
bifurcation in the phase plane: Type I underlies a saddle-node on invariant
cycle bifurcation, and Type II a Hopf bifurcation. The difficulty of modelling
Type I excitability is that it is not only represented by its underlying
bifurcation, but also should be able to generate frequency while maintaining a
small depolarising current. Using the mFHN model, we show that this situation
is possible without modifying the phase portrait, due to the incorporation of a
slow regenerative variable. We show that in the singular limit of the mFHN
model, the time-scale separation can be chosen such that there is a
configuration of a classical phase portrait that allows for SNIC bifurcation,
zero-frequency onset and a depolarising current, such as observed in Type I
excitability. Using the definition of slow conductance, g_s, we show that these
mathematical findings for excitability change are translatable to reduced
conductance based models and also relates to an experimentally measurable
quantity. This not only allows for a measure of excitability change, but also
relates the mathematical parameters that indicate a physiological Type I
excitability to parameters that can be tuned during experiments.

application to microwave and acoustic cavities open to directional waveguides.
The most simple are the symmetry protected BICs which are localized inside the
cavity because of the orthogonality of the eigenmodes to the propagating modes
of waveguides. However, the most general and interesting is the
Friedrich-Wintgen mechanism when the BICs are result of full destructive
interference of outgoing resonant modes. The third type of the BICs, the
Fabry-Perot BICs, occur in a double resonator system when each resonator can
serve as an ideal mirror. At last, the accidental BICs can be realized in the
open cavities with no symmetry like the open Sinai billiard in which the
eigenmode of the resonator can become orthogonal to the continuum of the
waveguide accidentally by a smooth deformation of the eigenmode. We also review
the one-dimensional systems in which the BICs occur owing to full destructive
interference of two waves separated by spin or polarization or by paths in the
Aharonov-Bohm rings. We widely use the method of effective non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian equivalent to the coupled mode theory which detects bound states in
the continuum (BICs) by finding zero widths resonances.

Fourier pseudo-spectral discretization in space. The surface diffusion term is
treated implicitly, while the nonlinear chemical potential is approximated by a
third order explicit extrapolation formula for the sake of solvability. In
addition, a third order accurate Douglas-Dupont regularization term, in the
form of $-A \Delta t^2 \Delta_N^2 ( u^{n+1} - u^n)$, is added in the numerical
scheme. A careful energy stability estimate, combined with Fourier eigenvalue
analysis, results in the energy stability in a modified version, and a
theoretical justification of the coefficient $A$ becomes available. As a result
of this energy stability analysis, a uniform in time bound of the numerical
energy is obtained. And also, the optimal rate convergence analysis and error
estimate are derived in details, in the $\ell^\infty (0,T; \ell^2) \cap \ell^2
(0,T; H_h^2)$ norm, with the help of a linearized estimate for the nonlinear
error terms. %This convergence estimate is the first such result for a third
order accurate scheme for a gradient flow. Some numerical simulation results
are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the numerical scheme and the
third order convergence. The long time simulation results for
$\varepsilon=0.02$ (up to $T=3 \times 10^5$) have indicated a logarithm law for
the energy decay, as well as the power laws for growth of the surface roughness
and the mound width. In particular, the power index for the surface roughness

more accurate than those produced by certain second order energy stable schemes

(ControlVAE), discusses its parameter tuning to meet application needs, derives
its key analytic properties, and offers useful extensions and applications.
ControlVAE is a new variational autoencoder (VAE) framework that combines the
automatic control theory with the basic VAE to stabilize the KL-divergence of
VAE models to a specified value. It leverages a non-linear PI controller, a
variant of the proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, to dynamically
tune the weight of the KL-divergence term in the evidence lower bound (ELBO)
using the output KL-divergence as feedback. This allows us to precisely control
the KL-divergence to a desired value (set point), which is effective in
avoiding posterior collapse and learning disentangled representations. In order
to improve the ELBO over the regular VAE, we provide simplified theoretical
analysis to inform setting the set point of KL-divergence for ControlVAE. We
observe that compared to other methods that seek to balance the two terms in
VAE's objective, ControlVAE leads to better learning dynamics. In particular,
it can achieve a good trade-off between reconstruction quality and
KL-divergence. We evaluate the proposed method on three tasks: image
generation, language modeling and disentangled representation learning. The
results show that ControlVAE can achieve much better reconstruction quality
than the other methods for comparable disentanglement. On the language modeling
task, ControlVAE can avoid posterior collapse (KL vanishing) and improve the
diversity of generated text. Moreover, our method can change the optimization
trajectory, improving the ELBO and the reconstruction quality for image
generation.

  To this end, a pilot study is conducted to evaluate students' movement
patterns to different contexts across the Arizona State University (ASU)

designed for examining the role of environmental factors on development and
maintenance of alcohol drinking behavior by a representative sample of ASU

alcohol drinking influences within those contexts (i.e., reaction) via a
SIR-type model. Of the four most visited contexts at ASU Tempe campus --
Library, Memorial Union, Fitness Center, and Dorm -- the context with the
highest visiting probability, Memorial Union, is the most influential and most
sensitive context (around $16$ times higher impact of alcohol related
influences than the other contexts) on spreading alcohol drinking behavior.

these practitioners often do not have access to the demographic data they feel
they need to detect bias in practice. Even with the growing variety of toolkits
and strategies for working towards algorithmic fairness, they almost invariably
require access to demographic attributes or proxies. We investigated this
dilemma through semi-structured interviews with 38 practitioners and
professionals either working in or adjacent to algorithmic fairness.
Participants painted a complex picture of what demographic data availability
and use look like on the ground, ranging from not having access to personal
data of any kind to being legally required to collect and use demographic data
for discrimination assessments. In many domains, demographic data collection
raises a host of difficult questions, including how to balance privacy and

sequence of numbers approximating properties of random numbers. These numbers
are widely employed in mid-level cryptography and in software applications.
Test suites are used to evaluate PRNGs quality by checking statistical
properties of the generated sequences. These sequences are commonly represented
bit by bit. This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to the
task of generating PRNGs from scratch by learning a policy to solve a partially
observable Markov Decision Process (MDP), where the full state is the period of
the generated sequence and the observation at each time step is the last
sequence of bits appended to such state. We use a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM)
architecture to model the temporal relationship between observations at
different time steps, by tasking the LSTM memory with the extraction of
significant features of the hidden portion of the MDP's states. We show that
modeling a PRNG with a partially observable MDP and a LSTM architecture largely
improves the results of the fully observable feedforward RL approach introduced
in previous work.

performance of the hardware design (resource usage, latency) is evaluated. Both
efficiency and purity of the Retina fitting are over 90%. Moreover we have also
added a Kalman filter after the Retina fit to improve the resolution on the
track parameters. Our simulation results show that the Kalman filter can work
well together with the Retina algorithm to find track through t-tbar event and

equitable allocations to borrowers. We devise a technique based on sequential
decision making that allow the lenders to adjust their choices based on the
dynamics of uncertainty from competition over time and that also impacts the

we review both traditional geometry-based image rectification methods and deep

extracting local features in the neighborhood of a pixel and then applying a

one hand, for stationary textures, which we model with Gaussian Markov random
fields, we construct the feature for each pixel by calculating the sample
covariance matrix of its neighborhood patch and cluster the pixels by an
application of k-means to group the covariance matrices. We show that this
generic method is consistent. On the other hand, for non-stationary fields, we

compressive and tensile force-displacement relations of the bilinear spring to
behave in a piece-wise linear manner, and all transmitted and reflected waves
scale linearly with the incident wave amplitude. We first concentrate on a
single bilinear spring connecting two waveguides. By controlling the bilinear
stiffness parameters it is possible to convert a time harmonic incident wave
into a transmitted wave of the same period but with particle displacement of a
single sign, positive or negative, an effect we call unilateral transmission.
Nonreciprocal wave phenomena are obtained by introducing spatial asymmetry. A
simple combination of a single bilinear spring with a mass and a linear spring
shows significant nonreciprocity with transmission relatively high in one
