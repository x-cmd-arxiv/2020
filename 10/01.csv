quantum differential equations. In this paper, we initiate a program to exhibit
these invariants as (mirror to) limiting extension classes of higher cycles on

We also construct an ``Ap\'ery motive'', whose mixed Hodge structure is shown,
as an application of the decomposition theorem, to contain the limiting

  Using a new technical result on the inhomogeneous Picard-Fuchs equations

calculations for LG-models mirror to several Fano threefolds. By describing the
``elementary'' Ap\'ery numbers in terms of regulators of higher cycles (i.e.,
algebraic $K$-theory/motivic cohomology classes), we obtain a satisfying
explanation of their arithmetic properties. Indeed, in each case, the LG-models
are modular families of $K3$ surfaces, and the distinction between multiples of
$\zeta(2)$ and $\zeta(3)$ (or $(2\pi\mathbf{i})^3$) translates ultimately into
one between algebraic $K_1$ and $K_3$ of the family.

is a key issue for ultra-high intensity laser applications. We present a scheme
to create such plasma slabs, based on the propagation and collision in a gas
jet of two counter-propagating blast waves (BW). Each BW is launched by a
sudden and local heating induced by a nanosecond laser beam that propagates
along the side of the jet. The resulting cylindrical BW expands perpendicular
to the beam. The shock front, bent by the gas jet density gradient, pushes and
compresses the plasma toward the jet center. By using two parallel ns laser
beams, this scheme enables to tailor independently two opposite sides of the
jet, while avoiding the damage risks associated with counterpropagating laser
beams. A parametric study is performed using two and three dimensional
hydrodynamic, as well as kinetic simulations. The BWs bending combined with the
collision in a stagnation regime increases the density by more than 10 times
and generates a very thin (down to few microns), near to over-critical plasma
slab with a high density contrast (> 100), and a lifetime of a few hundred
picoseconds. Two dimensional particle-in-cell simulations are used to study the
influence of plasma tailoring on proton acceleration by a high-intensity
sub-picosecond laser pulse. Tailoring the plasma not only at the entrance but
also the exit side of the ps-pulse enhances the proton beam collimation,
increases significantly the number of high energy protons, as well as their
maximum energy.

reasoning over relationships between entities grounded in first-order logical
proofs. Specifically, we perform soft theorem-proving by leveraging TLMs to
generate natural language proofs. We test the generated proofs for logical
consistency, along with the accuracy of the final inference. We observe
length-generalization issues when evaluated on longer-than-trained sequences.
However, we observe TLMs improve their generalization performance after being
exposed to longer, exhaustive proofs. In addition, we discover that TLMs are
able to generalize better using backward-chaining proofs compared to their
forward-chaining counterparts, while they find it easier to generate forward
chaining proofs. We observe that models that are not trained to generate proofs
are better at generalizing to problems based on longer proofs. This suggests
that Transformers have efficient internal reasoning strategies that are harder
to interpret. These results highlight the systematic generalization behavior of
TLMs in the context of logical reasoning, and we believe this work motivates

objective that provides a balanced tradeoff between the often conflicting
requirements of fairness and efficiency, defined as the weighted geometric mean
of agents' valuations. For the symmetric additive case of the problem, where
agents have the same weight with additive valuations, the first constant-factor
approximation algorithm was obtained in 2015. This led to a flurry of work
obtaining constant-factor approximation algorithms for the symmetric case under
mild generalizations of additive, and $O(n)$-approximation algorithms for more
general valuations and for the asymmetric case.
  In this paper, we make significant progress towards both symmetric and
asymmetric NSW problems. We present the first constant-factor approximation
algorithm for the symmetric case under Rado valuations. Rado valuations form a
general class of valuation functions that arise from maximum cost independent
matching problems, including as special cases assignment (OXS) valuations and
weighted matroid rank functions. Furthermore, our approach also gives the first
constant-factor approximation algorithm for the asymmetric case under Rado
valuations, provided that the maximum ratio between the weights is bounded by a

of abduction in explanatory reasoning (see Mueller, et al., 2018). It might be
worthwhile to pursue this, to develop intelligent systems that allow for the
observation and analysis of abductive reasoning and the assessment of abductive
reasoning as a learnable skill. Abductive inference has been defined in many
ways. For example, it has been defined as the achievement of insight. Most
often abduction is taken as a single, punctuated act of syllogistic reasoning,
like making a deductive or inductive inference from given premises. In
contrast, the originator of the concept of abduction---the American
scientist/philosopher Charles Sanders Peirce---regarded abduction as an
exploratory activity. In this regard, Peirce's insights about reasoning align
with conclusions from modern psychological research. Since abduction is often
defined as ""inferring the best explanation,"" the challenge of implementing
abductive reasoning and the challenge of automating the explanation process are
closely linked. We explore these linkages in this report. This analysis
provides a theoretical framework for understanding what the XAI researchers are
already doing, it explains why some XAI projects are succeeding (or might

corresponding van Hove singularities are observed in the electronic band
structure without and with spin-polarization. These parallel bands are the
origin of most of the transitions in the visible and the UV regions. A high
Seebeck coefficient is found in some TM-silicene without spin-polarization. In
the presence of emergent spin-polarization, a reduction or a magnification of
the Seebeck coefficient is seen due to a spin-dependent phase transition. We
find that the preferred state is a ferromagnetic state with a very high Curie

between the TM atoms and the silicene. As a result, a high magnetic moment
emerges in TM-silicene. Our results are potentially beneficial for thermospin,

using cubic sub-systems of one large simulation as facilitated by modern,

the susceptibility encoded in the composition structure factor of the whole

fluctuations in sub-volumes, and (3) applying the cumulant intersection
criterion to the sub-systems. For the last route, two difficulties arise:
sub-volumes are open systems with free boundary conditions, for which no
precise estimate of the critical Binder cumulant $U_c$ is available. Second,
the periodic boundaries of the simulation box interfere with the sub-volumes,
which we resolve by a two-parameter finite-size scaling. The implied
modification to the data analysis restores the common intersection point, and
we estimate $U_c=0.201 \pm 0.001$, universal for cubic Ising-like systems with
free boundaries. Confluent corrections to scaling, which arise for small
sub-system sizes, are quantified at leading order and our data for the critical

agents. In this opinion paper, our goal is to provide a snapshot of the present

current state of the art. We start with an overview of the existing literature
on emotion modeling in three areas of research: affective computing, social
robotics, and neurorobotics. Briefly summarizing the current state of knowledge
on natural emotion, we then highlight how existing proposals in artificial
emotion do not make sufficient contact with neuroscientific evidence. We
conclude by providing a set of principles to help guide future research in
artificial emotion and intelligent machines more generally. Overall, we argue
that a stronger integration of emotion-related processes in robot models is
critical for the design of human-like behavior in future intelligent machines.
Such integration not only will contribute to the development of autonomous
social machines capable of tackling real-world problems but would contribute to
advancing understanding of human emotion.

$\tau=1$, it is known that the learning dynamics are not guaranteed to converge
to a game-theoretically meaningful equilibria in general. In contrast, Jin et
al. (2020) showed that the stable critical points of gradient descent-ascent
coincide with the set of strict local minmax equilibria as

Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one of the widely known methods for model
compression. In essence, KD trains a smaller student model based on a larger
teacher model and tries to retain the teacher model's level of performance as
much as possible. However, existing KD methods suffer from the following
limitations. First, since the student model is smaller in absolute size, it
inherently lacks model capacity. Second, the absence of an initial guide for
the student model makes it difficult for the student to imitate the teacher
model to its fullest. Conventional KD methods yield low performance due to
these limitations. In this paper, we propose Pea-KD (Parameter-efficient and
accurate Knowledge Distillation), a novel approach to KD. Pea-KD consists of
two main parts: Shuffled Parameter Sharing (SPS) and Pretraining with Teacher's
Predictions (PTP). Using this combination, we are capable of alleviating the
KD's limitations. SPS is a new parameter sharing method that increases the
student model capacity. PTP is a KD-specialized initialization method, which
can act as a good initial guide for the student. When combined, this method
yields a significant increase in student model's performance. Experiments
conducted on BERT with different datasets and tasks show that the proposed
approach improves the student model's performance by 4.4\% on average in four
GLUE tasks, outperforming existing KD baselines by significant margins.

  Translation","accepted at Findings of EMNLP 2020",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Transfer learning is a popular strategy to improve the quality of
low-resource machine translation. For an optimal transfer of the embedding
layer, the child and parent model should share a substantial part of the
vocabulary. This is not the case when transferring to languages with a
different script. We explore the benefit of romanization in this scenario. Our
results show that romanization entails information loss and is thus not always
superior to simpler vocabulary transfer methods, but can improve the transfer
between related languages with different scripts. We compare two romanization
tools and find that they exhibit different degrees of information loss, which
affects translation quality. Finally, we extend romanization to the target
side, showing that this can be a successful strategy when coupled with a simple
deromanization model.

can teach a computer to learn from their actions and rewards similar to the way
humans learn from experience. It offers many advantages in automating decision
processes to navigate large parameter spaces. This paper proposes a novel
approach to the efficient measurement of quantum devices based on deep
reinforcement learning. We focus on double quantum dot devices, demonstrating
the fully automatic identification of specific transport features called bias
triangles. Measurements targeting these features are difficult to automate,
since bias triangles are found in otherwise featureless regions of the
parameter space. Our algorithm identifies bias triangles in a mean time of less
than 30 minutes, and sometimes as little as 1 minute. This approach, based on
dueling deep Q-networks, can be adapted to a broad range of devices and target
transport features. This is a crucial demonstration of the utility of deep
reinforcement learning for decision making in the measurement and operation of
quantum devices.

different insulating states at integer fillings in twisted bilayer graphene. In
particular, we provide a simple counting rule for the total number of soft
modes, and analyze their energies and symmetry quantum numbers in detail. To
study the soft mode spectra, we employ time dependent Hartree-Fock whose
results are reproduced analytically via an effective sigma model description.
We find two different types of low-energy modes - (i) approximate Goldstone
modes associated with breaking an enlarged U(4)$\times$U(4) symmetry and,
surprisingly, a set of (ii) nematic modes with non-zero angular momentum under
three-fold rotation. The modes of type (i) include true gapless Goldstone modes
associated with exact symmetries in addition to gapped ""pseudo-Goldstone"" modes
associated with approximate symmetries. While the modes of type (ii) are always
gapped, we show that their gap decreases as the Berry curvature grows more
concentrated. For realistic parameter values, the gapped soft modes of both
types have comparable gaps of only a few meV, and lie completely inside the
mean-field bandgap. The entire set of soft modes emerge as Goldstone modes of a
different idealized model in which Berry flux is limited to a solenoid, which
enjoys an enlarged U(8) symmetry. Furthermore, we discuss the number of
Goldstone modes for each symmetry-broken state, distinguishing the linearly vs
quadratically dispersing modes. Finally, we present a general symmetry analysis
of the soft modes for all possible insulating Slater determinant states at
integer fillings that preserve translation symmetry, independent of the
energetic details. The resulting soft mode degeneracies and symmetry quantum

Herschel ESA satellite from 70mu to 500mu. We first constructed column density
and dust temperature maps. Next, we identified compact cores in the maps, and
characterize the cores using modified blackbody fits to their SEDs: we
identified 684 starless cores, of which 199 are bound and potential prestellar
cores, and 132 protostars. We also matched the Herschel-identified young stars
with GAIA sources to model distance variations across the Perseus cloud. We
measure a linear gradient function with right ascension and declination for the
entire cloud. From the SED fits, mass and temperature of cores were derived.
The core mass function can be modelled with a log-normal distribution that
peaks at 0.82~$M_\sun$ suggesting a star formation efficiency of 0.30. The
high-mass tail can be modelled with a power law of slope $\sim-2.32$, close to
the Salpeter's value. We also identify the filamentary structure of Perseus,
confirming that stars form preferentially in filaments. We find that the
majority of filaments where star formation is ongoing are transcritical against
their own internal gravity because their linear masses are below the critical
limit of 16~$M_\sun$pc$^{-1}$ above which we expect filaments to collapse. We
find a possible explanation for this result, showing that a filament with a
linear mass as low as 8~$M_\sun$pc$^{-1}$ can be already unstable. We confirm a
linear relation between star formation efficiency and slope of dust probability
density function and a similar relation is also seen with the core formation
efficiency. We derive a lifetime for the prestellar core phase of
$1.69\pm0.52$~Myr for Perseus but different regions have a wide range in
prestellar core fractions, hint that star-formation has started only recently
in some clumps. We also derive a free-fall time for prestellar cores of
0.16~Myr.

dynamic behavior. Understanding the effect of weakly breaking a conservation
law due to coherent and incoherent errors is thus crucial, e.g., in the
realization of reliable quantum simulators. In this work, we perform exact
numerics and time-dependent perturbation theory to study the dynamics of
\textit{symmetry violation} in quantum many-body systems with slight coherent
(at strength $\lambda$) or incoherent (at strength $\gamma$) breaking of their
local and global symmetries. We rigorously prove the symmetry violation to be a
divergence measure in Hilbert space. Based on this, we show that symmetry
breaking generically leads to a crossover in the divergence growth from
diffusive behavior at onset times to ballistic or hyperballistic scaling at
intermediate times, before diffusion dominates at long times. More precisely,
we show that for local errors the leading coherent contribution to the symmetry
violation cannot be of order lower than $\propto\lambda t^2$ while its
leading-order incoherent counterpart is typically of order $\propto\gamma t$.
This remarkable interplay between unitary and incoherent gauge-breaking
scalings is also observed at higher orders in projectors onto symmetry
(super)sectors. Due to its occurrence at short times, the
diffusive-to-ballistic crossover is expected to be readily accessible in modern
ultracold-atom and NISQ-device experiments.

model where a Kronig-Penney-like description has been used to model spatially
periodic systems in one dimension. A number of these studies have focused on
finite systems, and results from these studies are distinct from those of
infinite lattice systems as a consequence of boundary effects. In the case of a
finite system, there remains a discrepancy in the results between tight-binding
descriptions and continuous lattice models. Periodic driving by a
time-dependent field in tight-binding models results in a collapse of all
quasienergies within a band at special driving amplitudes. In the continuum

remain gapped from the bulk bands as the field amplitude increases. We resolve
these discrepancies and explain how these edge bands represent Schr\""odinger

we show that these extended cat-like states become perfectly localized at the

We show that the appearance of quantum extremal islands in those models is a
consequence of the well-understood phase transition of RT surfaces, and does
not make any direct reference to ensemble averaging. For non-extremal black
holes the appearance of quantum extremal islands has the right behaviour to
avoid the information paradox in any dimension. We further show that for these
models the calculation of the full Page curve is possible in any dimension. The
calculation reduces to numerically solving two ODEs. In the case of extremal
black holes in higher dimensions, we find no quantum extremal islands for a
wide range of parameters. In two dimensions, our results agree with
arXiv:1910.11077 at leading order; however a finite UV cutoff introduced by the

in the quantum extremal surfaces moving further outward from the horizon, and
shifting the Page transition to a slightly earlier time.

metallicity of UKS~1 to be [Fe/H]$=-0.98\pm0.11$, considerably more metal-poor
than previously reported, and a negligible metallicity scatter, typical of that
observed by APOGEE in other Galactic globular clusters. In addition, we find a
mean radial velocity of $66.1\pm12.9$ km s$^{-1}$, which is in good agreement
with literature values, within 1$\sigma$. By selecting stars in the VIRAC

we add synthetic point sources to the inactive comparison galaxies. The

late stages of cosmic reionization. The observed sudden drop in Ly$\alpha$
fraction at $z>6$ is often interpreted as a sign of reionization, since the
intergalactic medium (IGM) is more neutral and opaque to Ly$\alpha$ photons.
Crucially, this interpretation of the observations is only valid under the
assumption that galaxies themselves experience a minimal evolution at these
epochs. By modelling Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer effects in and around
galaxies, we examine whether a change in the galactic properties can reproduce
the observed drop in the Ly$\alpha$ fraction. We find that an increase in the
galactic neutral hydrogen content or a reduction in the outflow velocity toward
higher redshift both lead to a lower Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction, and can thus
mimic an increasing neutral fraction of the IGM. We furthermore find that this
change in galactic properties leads to systematically different Ly$\alpha$
spectra which can be used to differentiate the two competing effects. Using the
CANDELSz7 survey measurements which indicate slightly broader lines at $z\sim
6$, we find that the scenario of a mere increase in the galactic column density
towards higher $z$ is highly unlikely. We also show that a decrease in outflow
velocity is not ruled out by existing data but leads to more prominent blue
peaks at $z>6$. Our results caution the use of Ly$\alpha$ observations to
estimate the IGM neutral fraction without accounting for the potential change
in the galactic properties, e.g., by mapping out the evolution of Ly$\alpha$
spectral characteristics.

similar to that which caused the common stellar populations in GCs. We

previous conflicting results over bulge N-rich stars, and broadly help to
understand GC formation and evolution. Furthermore, the discovery of such a

present a general approach for efficient hybrid-mode excitation by focusing the
incident light field in the basis of cylindrically polarized vector beams of

the higher-order polarization states and Stokes parameters (both defined
locally in polar coordinates), and visualized correspondingly on the
higher-order Poincar\'e spheres. The focal field is formulated exclusively in
cylindrical coordinates as a series sum of all focused beams of the associated
high-order paraxial beams. Our focal field decomposition enables an analysis of
hybrid-mode excitation via higher-order vector beams, and thus yields a

cosmological history due to their nearly perfect decoupling from the thermal
bath and any intervening matter after emission. In recent years, GW cosmology
has evolved from merely being an exciting prospect to an actively pursued
avenue for discovery, and the early results are very promising. As we highlight
in this paper, spectral distortions (SDs) of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) uniquely probe GWs over six decades in frequency, bridging the gap
between astrophysical high- and cosmological low-frequency measurements. This
means SDs will not only complement other GW observations, but will be the sole
probe of physical processes at certain scales. To illustrate this point, we
explore the constraining power of various proposed SD missions on a number of
phenomenological scenarios: early-universe phase transitions (PTs), GW
production via the dynamics of SU(2) and ultra-light U(1) axions, and cosmic
string (CS) network collapse. We highlight how some regions of parameter space

facilitate the implementation of SD constraints in arbitrary models we provide
GW2SD. This tool calculates the window function, which easily maps a GW

in an ill-posed inversion problem, leading to an infinite set of images as
possible solutions. Traditionally, this is tackled as a reconstruction problem
by searching for a single ""best"" image out of this solution set according to
some chosen regularization or prior. This approach, however, misses the
possibility of other solutions and hence ignores the uncertainty in the
inversion process. In this paper, we propose a method that instead returns
multiple images which are possible under the acquisition model and the chosen
prior to capture the uncertainty in the inversion process. To this end, we
introduce a low dimensional latent space and model the posterior distribution
of the latent vectors given the acquisition data in k-space, from which we can
sample in the latent space and obtain the corresponding images. We use a
variational autoencoder for the latent model and the Metropolis adjusted
Langevin algorithm for the sampling. We evaluate our method on two datasets;
with images from the Human Connectome Project and in-house measured multi-coil
images. We compare to five alternative methods. Results indicate that the
proposed method produces images that match the measured k-space data better
than the alternatives, while showing realistic structural variability.
Furthermore, in contrast to the compared methods, the proposed method yields
higher uncertainty in the undersampled phase encoding direction, as expected.

resource theories. In particular, we prove that monotones displaying lower
semicontinuity and strong superadditivity can be used to bound asymptotic
transformation rates in these settings. This removes the need for asymptotic
continuity, which cannot be defined in the traditional sense for
infinite-dimensional systems. We consider three applications, to the resource
theories of (I) optical nonclassicality, (II) entanglement, and (III) quantum
thermodynamics. In cases (II) and (III), the employed monotones are the
(infinite-dimensional) squashed entanglement and the free energy, respectively.
For case (I), we consider the measured relative entropy of nonclassicality and
prove it to be lower semicontinuous and strongly superadditive. One of our main
technical contributions, and a key tool to establish these results, is a handy
variational expression for the measured relative entropy of nonclassicality.
Our technique then yields computable upper bounds on asymptotic transformation
rates, including those achievable under linear optical elements. We also prove
a number of results which guarantee that the measured relative entropy of
nonclassicality is bounded on any physically meaningful state and easily
computable for some classes of states of interest, e.g., Fock diagonal states.

optics. Mirrors operate in diverse and harsh environments that range from
Low-Earth Orbit, to interplanetary orbits and the deep space. The operational
life of space observatories spans from minutes (sounding rockets) to decades
(large observatories), and the performance of the mirrors within the optical
system is susceptible to degrade, which results in a transient optical
efficiency of the instrument. The degradation that occurs in space environments
depends on the operational life on the orbital properties of the space mission,
and it reduces the total system throughput and hence compromises the science

how they affect mirror performance, and how to prevent it, is of paramount

With the continuous improvement of quantum devices, dedicated algorithms are
needed to exploit the potential quantum computers can provide. We propose
general and extendable algorithms for quantum gate computers to facilitate
calculations of helicity amplitudes and the parton shower process. The helicity
amplitude calculation exploits the equivalence between spinors and qubits and
the unique features of a quantum computer to compute the helicities of each
particle involved simultaneously, thus fully utilising the quantum nature of
the computation. This advantage over classical computers is further exploited
by the simultaneous computation of s and t-channel amplitudes for a
2$\rightarrow$2 process. The parton shower algorithm simulates collinear
emission for a two-step, discrete parton shower. In contrast to classical
implementations, the quantum algorithm constructs a wavefunction with a
superposition of all shower histories for the whole parton shower process, thus
removing the need to explicitly keep track of individual shower histories. Both
algorithms utilise the quantum computer's ability to remain in a quantum state
throughout the computation and represent a first step towards a quantum
computing algorithm to describe the full collision event at the LHC.

the polarization of the idler photon provides path information for the signal
photon. The setup is very similar to the delayed-choice quantum eraser
experimentally studied by the Vienna group. In the class of quantum erasers
with discrete output states, it is easy to see that the delayed mode leaves no
choice for the experimenter. The which-way information is always erased, and
every detected signal photon fixes the polarization state of the idler, and
thus gives information on precisely how the signal photon traversed the two
paths. The analysis shows that the Vienna delayed-choice quantum eraser is the
first experimental demonstration of the fact that the delayed mode leaves no
choice for the experimenter, and the which-way information is always erased.
Additionally it is shown that this argument holds even in a conventional
two-slit quantum eraser. Every photon registered anywhere on the screen, fixes
the state of the two-state which-way detector in a unique mutually unbiased
basis. In the delayed-choice quantum eraser experiments, the role of mutually
unbiased basis sets for the which-way detector, has been overlooked till now.

up the possibility to control properties of statistical systems via the
inclusion of these functions in Hamiltonians. In particular, we include the
predictive function of a neural network, designed for phase classification, as
a conjugate variable coupled to an external field within the Hamiltonian of a
system. Results in the two-dimensional Ising model evidence that the field can
induce an order-disorder phase transition by breaking or restoring the
symmetry, in contrast with the field of the conventional order parameter which
causes explicit symmetry breaking. The critical behavior is then studied by
proposing a Hamiltonian-agnostic reweighting approach and forming a
renormalization group mapping on quantities derived from the neural network.
Accurate estimates of the critical point and of the critical exponents related
to the operators that govern the divergence of the correlation length are
provided. We conclude by discussing how the method provides an essential step
toward bridging machine learning and physics.

  Transient Convection-Diffusion Problems",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We establish stable finite element (FE) approximations of
convection-diffusion initial boundary value problems using the automatic
variationally stable finite element (AVS-FE) method. The transient
convection-diffusion problem leads to issues in classical FE methods as the
differential operator can be considered singular perturbation in both space and
time. The unconditional stability of the AVS-FE method, regardless of the
underlying differential operator, allows us significant flexibility in the
construction of FE approximations. We take two distinct approaches to the FE
discretization of the convection-diffusion problem: i) considering a space-time
approach in which the temporal discretization is established using finite
elements, and ii) a method of lines approach in which we employ the AVS-FE
method in space whereas the temporal domain is discretized using the
generalized-alpha method. In the generalized-alpha method, we discretize the
temporal domain into finite sized time-steps and adopt the generalized-alpha
method as time integrator. Then, we derive a corresponding norm for the
obtained operator to guarantee the temporal stability of the method.
  We present numerical verifications for both approaches, including numerical
asymptotic convergence studies highlighting optimal convergence properties.
Furthermore, in the spirit of the discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin method by
Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan, the AVS-FE method also leads to readily available
a posteriori error estimates through a Riesz representer of the residual of the
AVS-FE approximations. Hence, the norm of the resulting local restrictions of
these estimates serve as error indicators in both space and time for which we
present multiple numerical verifications adaptive strategies.

testing) is more efficient in reducing the number of tests and potentially
leading to tremendous cost reduction. As indicated in the recent article posted
on the US FDA website, the group testing approach for COVID-19 has received a
lot of interest lately. There are two key elements in a group testing
technique: (i) the pooling matrix that directs samples to be pooled into
groups, and (ii) the decoding algorithm that uses the group test results to
reconstruct the status of each sample. In this paper, we propose a new family
of pooling matrices from packing the pencil of lines (PPoL) in a finite
projective plane. We compare their performance with various pooling matrices
proposed in the literature, including 2D-pooling, P-BEST, and Tapestry, using
the two-stage definite defectives (DD) decoding algorithm. By conducting
extensive simulations for a range of prevalence rates up to 5%, our numerical
results show that there is no pooling matrix with the lowest relative cost in
the whole range of the prevalence rates. To optimize the performance, one
should choose the right pooling matrix, depending on the prevalence rate. The
family of PPoL matrices can dynamically adjust their column weights according
to the prevalence rates and could be a better alternative than using a fixed
pooling matrix.

a key parameter driving this anti-correlation is the effective temperature of

high-mass binary stars. The masses and spins of these BBHs are determined by
the complicated interplay of phenomena such as tides, winds, accretion,
common-envelope evolution (CEE), supernova natal kicks, and stellar
core-envelope coupling. The gravitational waves emitted during the mergers of
BBHs depend on their masses and spins and can thus constrain these phenomena.
We present a simplified model of binary stellar evolution and identify regions
of the parameter space that produce BBHs with large spins misaligned with their
orbital angular momentum. In Scenario A (B) of our model, stable mass transfer
(SMT) occurs after Roche-lobe overflow (RLOF) of the more (less) massive star,
while CEE follows RLOF of the less (more) massive star. Each scenario is
further divided into Pathways 1 and 2 depending on whether the core of the more
massive star collapses before or after RLOF of the less massive star,
respectively. If the stellar cores are coupled weakly to their envelopes,
highly spinning BBHs can be produced if natal spins greater than $10\%$ of the
breakup value are inherited from the stellar progenitors. BBHs can
alternatively acquire large spins by tidal synchronization during the
Wolf-Rayet stage in Scenario A or by accretion onto the initially more massive
star during SMT in Scenario B. BBH spins can be highly misaligned if the kicks
are comparable to the orbital velocity, which is more easily achieved in
Pathway A1 where the kick of the more massive star precedes CEE.

Thompson Sampling (SCLTS) and stage-wise conservative linear UCB (SCLUCB), that
respect the baseline constraints and enjoy probabilistic regret bounds of order
O(\sqrt{T} \log^{3/2}T) and O(\sqrt{T} \log T), respectively. Notably, the
proposed algorithms can be adjusted with only minor modifications to tackle
different problem variations, such as constraints with bandit-feedback, or an
unknown sequence of baseline actions. We discuss these and other improvements

show that SCLTS plays the (non-optimal) baseline action at most O(\log{T})
times (compared to O(\sqrt{T})). Finally, we make connections to another
studied form of safety constraints that takes the form of an upper bound on the

modeling clustering tasks in a metric space. In practice and historically,
k-means is thought of in a continuous setting, namely where the centers can be
located anywhere in the metric space. For example, the popular Lloyd's
heuristic locates a center at the mean of each cluster.
  Despite persistent efforts on understanding the approximability of k-means,
and other classic clustering problems such as k-median and k-minsum, our
knowledge of the hardness of approximation factors of these problems remains
quite poor. In this paper, we significantly improve upon the hardness of
approximation factors known in the literature for these objectives. We show
that if the input lies in a general metric space, it is NP-hard to approximate:
  $\bullet$ Continuous k-median to a factor of $2-o(1)$; this improves upon the
previous inapproximability factor of 1.36 shown by Guha and Khuller (J.

  $\bullet$ Continuous k-means to a factor of $4- o(1)$; this improves upon the

implementing Majorana braiding in real systems: On the one hand, perfect
braiding should be conducted adiabatically slowly to avoid non-topological
errors. On the other hand, braiding must be conducted fast such that
decoherence effects introduced by the environment are negligible, which are
generally unavoidable in finite-size systems. This competition results in an
intermediate time scale for Majorana braiding that is optimal, but generally
not error-free. Here, we calculate this intermediate time scale for a
T-junction of short one-dimensional topological superconductors coupled to a
bosonic bath that generates fluctuations in the local electric potential, which
stem from, e.g., environmental photons or phonons of the substrate. We thereby
obtain boundaries for the speed of Majorana braiding with a predetermined gate

in the past to attain higher capacity and topology reconfigurability, though
commercial adoption of these architectures have been minimal. One major
challenge these architectures face is the difficulty of handling uncertain
traffic demands using commercial optical circuit switches (OCS) with high
switching latency. Prior works have generally focused on developing
fast-switching OCS prototypes to quickly react to traffic changes through
frequent reconfigurations. This approach, however, adds tremendous complexity
to the control plane, and raises the barrier for commercial adoption of optical
circuit switched data center networks.
  We propose COUDER, a robust topology and routing optimization framework for
reconfigurable optical circuit switched data centers. COUDER optimizes topology
and routing based on a convex set of traffic matrices, and offers strict
throughput guarantees for any future traffic matrices bounded by the convex
set. For the bursty traffic demands that are unbounded by the convex set, we
employ a desensitization technique to reduce performance hit. This enables
COUDER to generate topology and routing solutions capable of handling
unexpected traffic changes without relying on frequent topology
reconfigurations. Our extensive evaluations based on Facebook's production DCN
traces show that, even with daily reconfiguration, COUDER achieves about 20\%
higher throughput, and about 32\% lower average hop count compared to
cost-equivalent static topologies. Our work shows that adoption of

neighbors in which neither the crystallographic cubic structure of the SrTiO3
nor the orthorhombic structure of the GdTiO3 fits well. X-ray absorption near
edge spectroscopy (XANES) spectrum at Ti LIII,II-edges shows an asymmetric peak
because of the splitting between the eg orbitals of 3d band for SrTiO3 sample.
The addition of Gd atoms to SrTiO3 structure cause an enlargement of this peak
and this split is associated with a small displacement of Ti atoms from their
centrosymmetric position. Several features of the XANES spectra at O k-edge for
Sr1-xGdxTiO3 samples are affected by the increase of Gd concentration.
According to our calculated projected density of states, these transitions are
related to a reduction in the number of unoccupied O 2p - Ti 3d states caused
by the split of Ti 3d band. Moreover, these XANES spectra also show a
dependence of the increasing of the hybridization between O 2p and Gd 5d4f6s
states.

a three-dimensional quantum Hall system. Utilizing a transfer-matrix method, we
find that the localization length of the surface state along the magnetic field
decreases with the surface disorder strength in the weak disorder regime, but
increases anomalously in the strong disorder regime. In the strong disorder
regime, the surface states mainly locate at the first inward layer to avoid the
strong disorder in the outmost layer. The anomalous increase of the
localization length can be explained by an effective model, which maps the
strong disorder on the surface layer to the weak disorder on the first inward
layer. Our work demonstrates that surface disorder can be an effective way to
control the transport behavior of the surface states along the magnetic field.
We also investigate the effect of surface disorder on the full distribution of
conductances P(g) of the surface states in the quasi-one-dimensional (1D)
regime for various surface disorder strengths. In particular, we find that P(g)
is Gaussian in the quasi-1D metal regime and log-normal in the quasi-1D
insulator regime. In the crossover regime, P(g) exhibits highly nontrivial
forms, whose shapes coincide with the results obtained from the
Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar equation of a weakly disordered quasi-1D wire in
the absence of time-reversal symmetry. Our results suggest that P(g) is fully
determined by the average conductance, independent of the details of the
system, in agreement with the single-parameter scaling hypothesis.

  Problems",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An immediate snapshot object is a high level communication object, built on
top of a read/write distributed system in which all except one processes may
crash. It allows a process to write a value and obtain a set of values that
represent a snapshot of the values written to the object, occurring immediately
after the write step.
  Considering an $n$-process model in which up to $t$ processes may crash, this
paper introduces first the $k$-resilient immediate snapshot object, which is a
natural generalization of the basic immediate snapshot (which corresponds to
the case $k=t=n-1$). In addition to the set containment properties of the basic
immediate snapshot, a $k$-resilient immediate snapshot object requires that
each set returned to a process contains at least $(n-k)$ pairs.
  The paper first shows that, for $k,t<n-1$, $k$-resilient immediate snapshot
is impossible in asynchronous read/write systems. %Then the paper investigates
the space of objects that %are impossible to solve in $n$-process $t$-crash
read/write systems. Then the paper investigates a model of computation where
the processes communicate with each other by accessing $k$-immediate snapshot
objects, and shows that this model is stronger than the $t$-crash model.
Considering the space of $x$-set agreement problems (which are impossible to
solve in systems such that $x\leq t$), the paper shows then that $x$-set
agreement can be solved in read/write systems enriched with $k$-immediate
snapshot objects for $x=\max(1,t+k-(n-2))$. It also shows that, in these
systems, $k$-resilient immediate snapshot and consensus are equivalent when
$1\leq t<n/2$ and $t\leq k\leq (n-1)-t$. Hence, %thanks to the problem map it
provides, the paper establishes strong relations linking fundamental
distributed computing objects (one related to communication, the other to
agreement), which are impossible to solve in pure read/write systems.

substantial gain in terms of data rates. However, 5G and Beyond will depart
from this scheme, with the objective not only to provide services with higher
data rates. One of the main goals is to support massive machine-type
communications (mMTC) in the IoT applications. Supporting massive uplink (UP)
communications for devices with sporadic traffic pattern and short-packet size,
as it is in many mMTC use cases, is a challenging task, particularly when the
control signaling is not negligible in size compared to the payload. Also,
channel estimation is challenging for sporadic and short-packet transmission
due to the limited number of employed pilots. In this paper, a new UP multiple
access (MA) scheme is proposed for mMTC, which can support a large number of
uncoordinated IoT devices with short-packet and sporadic traffic. The proposed
UP MA scheme removes the overheads associated with the device identifier as
well as pilots related to channel estimation. An alternative mechanism for
device identification is proposed, where a unique spreading code is dedicated
to each IoT device. This unique code is simultaneously used for the spreading
purpose and device identification. Two IoT device identification algorithms
which employ sparse signal reconstruction methods are proposed to determine the
active IoT devices prior to data detection. Specifically, the BIC model order
selection method is employed to develop an IoT device identification algorithm
for unknown and time-varying probability of device activity. Our proposed MA
scheme benefits from a non-coherent multiuser detection algorithm based on
machine learning to enable data detection without a priori knowledge on channel
state information. The effectiveness of the proposed MA scheme for known and
unknown probability of activity is supported by simulation results.

existence of a so-called strict grading whose associated filtration agrees with

effective theory, the $SO(3)$ isospin is broken to $U(1)'$, through a
$S^1/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}'_2)$ orbifold, then subsequently
dynamically broken, resulting in a massive $Z'$. Quarks and leptons in the 5d
bulk appear as massless modes, with zero Yukawa couplings to the Higgs on the
brane, and zero couplings to $Z'$, at leading order, due to the $U(1)'$
symmetry. However, after the $U(1)'$ breaking, both Yukawa couplings and
non-universal $Z'$ couplings are generated by heavy Kaluza-Klein exchanges.
Hierarchical quark and lepton masses result from a hierarchy of 5d Dirac
fermion masses. Neutrino mass and mixing arises from a novel type Ib seesaw
mechanism, mediated by Kaluza-Klein Dirac neutrinos. The non-universal $Z'$

ordinary CE is first executed assuming quasi-static channels, followed by DSA
realized via joint RIS reflection pattern selection and transformations between

incurring negligible extra overhead compared with the number of symbols
required for the original CE. For the single-path case which is especially
applicable to millimeter-wave and terahertz systems, a novel low-complexity CE

connectivity in males and females differs in an age prediction framework. We
first estimate functional connectivity between regions-of-interest (ROIs) using
distance correlation instead of Pearson's correlation. Distance correlation, as
a multivariate statistical method, explores spatial relations of voxel-wise
time courses within individual ROIs and measures both linear and nonlinear
dependence, capturing more complex information of between-ROI interactions.
Then, a novel non-convex multi-task learning (NC-MTL) model is proposed to
study age-related gender differences in functional connectivity, where age
prediction for each gender group is viewed as one task. Specifically, in the
proposed NC-MTL model, we introduce a composite regularizer with a combination
of non-convex $\ell_{2,1-2}$ and $\ell_{1-2}$ regularization terms for
selecting both common and task-specific features. Finally, we validate the
proposed NC-MTL model along with distance correlation based functional

overlap of subdomains. For singlerate timestepping, we also find that the
high-order PC scheme is stable when the number of corrector iterations ($Q$) is
odd. This difference in the stability of odd- and even-$Q$ is novel and has not
been demonstrated in the literature for overlapping grid-based methods. We
address the odd-even behavior in the stability of the PC scheme by modifying
the last corrector iterate, which leads to a scheme whose stability increases
monotonically with $Q$. For multirate timestepping, we observe that the
stability of the PC scheme depends on the timestep ratio ($\eta$). For
$\eta=2$, even-$Q$ is more stable than odd-$Q$. For $\eta\ge3$, even-$Q$ is
more stable than odd-$Q$ for a small nondimensional timestep size and the

at $M_{\rm vir}\simeq10^{14} M_{\odot}$. The outer stellar masses are in

that reducing stellar growth at early times in $M_\star \sim 10^{9-10}

scale. The Ponos simulations do not implement AGN feedback and display an
excess mass of ~0.5 dex at $r<30$ kpc compared to HSC which is indicative of
over-cooling and excess star formation in the central regions. Joint
comparisons between weak lensing and galaxy stellar profiles are a direct test
of whether simulations build and deposit galaxy mass in the correct dark matter
halos and thereby provide powerful constraints on the physics of feedback and
galaxy growth.

hybrid paradigm in which a computationally cheap, coarse-grained model is
coupled to a more expensive, but more detailed fine-grained model enabling the
accurate simulation of the fine-scale dynamics at a reasonable computational

functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine the reaction pathway for
diborane dissociating into a species that will incorporate as electrically
active substitutional boron after adsorbing onto the Si(100)-2$\times$1
surface. Our calculations indicate that diborane must overcome an energy
barrier to adsorb, explaining the experimentally observed low sticking
coefficient ($< 10^{-4}$ at room temperature) and suggesting that heating can
be used to increase the adsorption rate. Upon sticking, diborane has an $\sim
50\%$ chance of splitting into two BH$_3$ fragments versus merely losing
hydrogen to form a dimer such as B$_2$H$_4$. As boron dimers are likely
electrically inactive, whether this latter reaction occurs is shown to be
predictive of the incorporation rate. The dissociation process proceeds with
significant energy barriers, necessitating the use of high temperatures for
incorporation. Using the barriers calculated from DFT, we parameterize a
Kinetic Monte Carlo model that predicts the incorporation statistics of boron
as a function of the initial depassivation geometry, dose, and anneal
temperature. Our results suggest that the dimer nature of diborane inherently
limits its doping density as an acceptor precursor, and furthermore that
heating the boron dimers to split before exposure to silicon can lead to poor
selectivity on hydrogen and halogen resists. This suggests that while diborane
works as an atomic precision acceptor precursor, other non-dimerized acceptor
precursors may lead to higher incorporation rates at lower temperatures.

Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) of the molecular outflow associated
with Orion Source I. The observations show velocity asymmetries about the flow
axis which are interpreted as outflow rotation. We find that the rotation
velocity ($\sim$4--8 km s$^{-1}$) decreases with the vertical distance to the
disk. In contrast, the cylindrical radius ($\sim$100--300 au), the expansion
velocity ($\sim$2--15 km s$^{-1}$), and the axial velocity $v_{\rm z}$
($\sim$-1--10 km s$^{-1}$) increase with the vertical distance. The mass
estimated of the molecular outflow $\mathrm{M}_{\rm outflow}\sim$0.66--1.3
M$_\odot$. Given a kinematic time $\sim$130 yr, this implies a mass loss rate
$\dot{\mathrm{M}}_{\rm outflow} \sim 5.1-10 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$
yr$^{-1}$. This massive outflow sets important contraints on disk wind models.
We compare the observations with a model of a shell produced by the interaction
between an anisotropic stellar wind and an Ulrich accretion flow that
corresponds to a rotating molecular envelope in collapse. We find that the
model cylindrical radii are consistent with the $^{29}$SiO(J=8--7) $\nu$=0

similar the observed values, except close to the disk ($z\sim\pm$150 au) for
the expansion velocity. Nevertheless, the rotation velocities of the model are
a factor $\sim$3--10 lower than the observed values. We conclude that the
Ulrich flow alone cannot explain the rotation observed and other possibilities
should be explored, like the inclusion of the angular momentum of a disk wind.

dynamic control strategies to obtain an efficient solver for large-scale CPPs:
Commercial-GENCOL-DCA. These solvers are designed to aggregate the flights
covering constraints to reduce the size of the problem. Then, we use machine

necessary, to produce a good solution. We show, on monthly CPPs with up to 50
000 flights, that Commercial-GENCOL-DCA with clusters produced by ML-based
heuristics outperforms Baseline fed by initial clusters that are pairings of a

  Detection","conference",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Polyphonic sound event localization and detection is not only detecting what
sound events are happening but localizing corresponding sound sources. This
series of tasks was first introduced in DCASE 2019 Task 3. In 2020, the sound
event localization and detection task introduces additional challenges in
moving sound sources and overlapping-event cases, which include two events of
the same type with two different direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles. In this
paper, a novel event-independent network for polyphonic sound event
localization and detection is proposed. Unlike the two-stage method we proposed
in DCASE 2019 Task 3, this new network is fully end-to-end. Inputs to the
network are first-order Ambisonics (FOA) time-domain signals, which are then
fed into a 1-D convolutional layer to extract acoustic features. The network is
then split into two parallel branches. The first branch is for sound event
detection (SED), and the second branch is for DoA estimation. There are three
types of predictions from the network, SED predictions, DoA predictions, and
event activity detection (EAD) predictions that are used to combine the SED and
DoA features for on-set and off-set estimation. All of these predictions have
the format of two tracks indicating that there are at most two overlapping
events. Within each track, there could be at most one event happening. This
architecture introduces a problem of track permutation. To address this
problem, a frame-level permutation invariant training method is used.
Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect polyphonic sound
events and their corresponding DoAs. Its performance on the Task 3 dataset is
greatly increased as compared with that of the baseline method.

a discrete-time DeGroot model of opinion dynamics on these tie-decay networks,
and we carry out numerical computations for the continuous-time Laplacian
dynamics. We examine the speed of convergence by studying the spectral gaps of
combinatorial Laplacian matrices of tie-decay networks. First, we compare the
spectral gaps of the Laplacian matrices of tie-decay networks that we construct
from empirical data with the spectral gaps for corresponding randomized and
aggregate networks. We find that the spectral gaps for the empirical networks
tend to be smaller than those for the randomized and aggregate networks.
Second, we study the spectral gap as a function of the tie-decay rate and time.
Intuitively, we expect small tie-decay rates to lead to fast convergence
because the influence of each interaction between two nodes lasts longer for
smaller decay rates. Moreover, as time progresses and more interactions occur,
we expect eventual convergence. However, we demonstrate that the spectral gap
need not decrease monotonically with respect to the decay rate or increase
monotonically with respect to time. Our results highlight the importance of the
interplay between the times that edges strengthen and decay in temporal
networks.

transport quantity, which propagates along the chain but has a finite lifetime

quantum continuity equation acquires a source term due to the transverse
vorticity flow. The latter reflects the phase slips and generally compromises
the global conservation law. A linear-response formalism for the nonlocal
winding transport then reduces to a Kubo response for the winding flow along
the spin chain, in conjunction with the parasitic vorticity flow transverse to
it. One-dimensional topological hydrodynamics can be recovered when the
vorticity flow is asymptotically small. Starting with a microscopic spin-chain
formulation, we focus on the asymptotic behavior of the winding transport based
on the renormalized sine-Gordon equation, incorporating phase slips as well as
Gilbert damping. A generic electrical device is proposed to manifest this
physics. We thus suggest winding conductivity as a tangible concept that can

CH$_4$, CO$_2$, and NH$_3$ in Jupiter- and Neptune-class planets. We show the
cooling history of a planet, which depends most significantly on planetary mass
and age, can have a dominant effect on abundances in the visible atmosphere,
often swamping trends one might expect based on Teq alone. The onset of
detectable CH$_4$ in spectra can be delayed to lower Teq for some planets
compared to equilibrium, or pushed to higher Teq. The detectability of NH$_3$
is typically enhanced compared to equilibrium expectations, which is opposite
to the brown dwarf case. We find that both CH$_4$ and NH$_3$ can become
detectable at around the same Teq (at Teq values that vary with mass and
metallicity) whereas these ""onset"" temperatures are widely spaced for brown
dwarfs. We suggest observational strategies to search for atmospheric trends
and stress that non-equilibrium chemistry and clouds can serve as probes of
atmospheric physics. As examples of atmospheric complexity, we assess three
Neptune-class planets GJ 436b, GJ 3470b, and WASP-107, all around Teq=700 K.
Tidal heating due to eccentricity damping in all three planets heats the deep
atmosphere by thousands of degrees, and may explain the absence of CH$_4$ in
these cool atmospheres. Atmospheric abundances must be interpreted in the

require multiple neuroimaging modalities for accurate detection. Quantitative
susceptibility mapping (QSM) derived from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) is necessary to differentiate between iron content and mineralization. We
set out to develop a deep learning-based segmentation method suitable for
segmenting both CMBs and iron deposits. We included a convenience sample of 24

weighted imaging (SWI), and QSM to segment the two types of lesions. We
developed a protocol for simultaneous manual annotation of CMBs and
non-hemorrhage iron deposits in the basal ganglia. This manual annotation was
then used to train a deep convolution neural network (CNN). Specifically, we
adapted the U-Net model with a higher number of resolution layers to be able to
detect small lesions such as CMBs from standard resolution MRI. We tested
different combinations of the three modalities to determine the most

a meaning representation (MR) as input. They are trained end-to-end with a
corpus of MR/utterance pairs, where the MRs cover a specific set of dialogue
acts and domain attributes. Creation of such datasets is labor-intensive and
time-consuming. Therefore, dialogue systems for new domain ontologies would
benefit from using data for pre-existing ontologies. Here we explore, for the
first time, whether it is possible to train an NLG for a new larger ontology
using existing training sets for the restaurant domain, where each set is based
on a different ontology. We create a new, larger combined ontology, and then
train an NLG to produce utterances covering it. For example, if one dataset has
attributes for family-friendly and rating information, and the other has
attributes for decor and service, our aim is an NLG for the combined ontology
that can produce utterances that realize values for family-friendly, rating,
decor and service. Initial experiments with a baseline neural
sequence-to-sequence model show that this task is surprisingly challenging. We
then develop a novel self-training method that identifies (errorful) model
outputs, automatically constructs a corrected MR input to form a new (MR,
utterance) training pair, and then repeatedly adds these new instances back
into the training data. We then test the resulting model on a new test set. The
result is a self-trained model whose performance is an absolute 75.4%
improvement over the baseline model. We also report a human qualitative
evaluation of the final model showing that it achieves high naturalness,
semantic coherence and grammaticality

non-rotating case ($a=0$) and a deformed one in the rotating case ($a\neq{0}$).
For a fixed value of $a$, the size of the shadow increases with the increasing

the black hole emission rate. We found that the emission rate decreases with
the increasing $\vert{k}\vert$ (or $Q$) and the peak of the emission shifts to

grouping, and aggregation. Three algorithms exist: in-stream aggregation is
most efficient by far but requires sorted input; sort-based aggregation relies
on external merge sort; and hash aggregation relies on an in-memory hash table
plus hash partitioning to temporary storage. Cost-based query optimization
chooses which algorithm to use based on several factors including the sort
order of the input, input and output sizes, and the need for sorted output. For
example, hash-based aggregation is ideal for output smaller than the available
memory (e.g., TPC-H Query 1), whereas sorting the entire input and aggregating
after sorting are preferable when both aggregation input and output are large
and the output needs to be sorted for a subsequent operation such as a merge
join.
  Unfortunately, the size information required for a sound choice is often
inaccurate or unavailable during query optimization, leading to sub-optimal
algorithm choices. In response, this paper introduces a new algorithm for
sort-based duplicate removal, grouping, and aggregation. The new algorithm
always performs at least as well as both traditional hash-based and traditional
sort-based algorithms. It can serve as a system's only aggregation algorithm
for unsorted inputs, thus preventing erroneous algorithm choices. Furthermore,
the new algorithm produces sorted output that can speed up subsequent
operations. Google's F1 Query uses the new algorithm in production workloads
that aggregate petabytes of data every day.

for obtaining an estimate of the 3D translation and rotation of each pose in a

called GeoD, implements a continuous time distributed consensus protocol to
minimize the geodesic pose graph error. GeoD is distributed over the pose graph
itself, with a separate computation thread for each node in the graph, and
messages are passed only between neighboring nodes in the graph. We leverage
tools from Lyapunov theory and multi-agent consensus to prove the convergence
of the algorithm. We identify two new consistency conditions sufficient for
convergence: pairwise consistency of relative rotation measurements, and
minimal consistency of relative translation measurements. GeoD incorporates a
simple one step distributed initialization to satisfy both conditions. We
demonstrate GeoD on simulated and real world SLAM datasets. We compare to a
centralized pose graph optimizer with an optimality certificate (SE-Sync) and a
Distributed Gauss-Seidel (DGS) method. On average, GeoD converges 20 times more
quickly than DGS to a value with 3.4 times less error when compared to the
global minimum provided by SE-Sync. GeoD scales more favorably with graph size
than DGS, converging over 100 times faster on graphs larger than 1000 poses.
Lastly, we test GeoD on a multi-UAV vision-based SLAM scenario, where the UAVs
estimate their pose trajectories in a distributed manner using the relative
poses extracted from their on board camera images. We show qualitative
performance that is better than either the centralized SE-Sync or the

the feedback losses to the arms producing them. To address this problem, this

image-guided surgery, obscuring visualization of metal instruments and adjacent
anatomy. Recent advances in mobile C-arm systems have enabled 3D imaging
capacity with non-circular orbits. We extend a previously proposed metal
artifacts avoidance (MAA) method to reduce the influence of metal artifacts by
prospectively defining a non-circular orbit that avoids metal-induced biases in
projection domain. Accurate geometric calibration is an important challenge to
accurate 3D image reconstruction for such orbits. We investigate the
performance of interpolation-based calibration from a library of circular
orbits for any non-circular orbit. We apply the method to non-circular scans
acquired for MAA, which involves: (i) coarse 3D localization of metal objects
via only two scout views using an end-to-end trained neural network; (ii)
calculation of the metal-induced x-ray spectral shift for all possible views;
and (iii) identification of the non-circular orbit that minimizes the
variations in spectral shift. Non-circular orbits with interpolation-based
geometric calibration yielded reasonably accurate 3D image reconstruction. The
end-to-end neural network accurately localized metal implants with just two
scout views even in complex anatomical scenes, improving Dice coefficient by
~42% compared to a more conventional cascade of separately trained U-nets. In a
spine phantom with pedicle screw instrumentation, non-circular orbits
identified by the MAA method reduced the magnitude of metal ""blomming""
artifacts (apparent width of the screw shaft) in CBCT reconstructions by ~70%.
The proposed imaging and calibration methods present a practical means to
improve image quality in mobile C-arm CBCT by identifying non-circular scan

dates back at least to Jordan, who classified pencils (one-dimensional systems)
of conics over $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{R}$ in 1906--1907. The analogous
problem for finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ odd was solved by Dickson in
1908. In 1914, Wilson attempted to classify nets (two-dimensional systems) of
conics over finite fields of odd characteristic, but his classification was
incomplete and contained some inaccuracies. In a recent article, we completed
Wilson's classification of nets of rank one, namely those containing a repeated
line. The aim of the present paper is to introduce and calculate certain
combinatorial invariants of these nets, which we expect will be of use in
various applications. Our approach is geometric in the sense that we view a net
of rank one as a plane in $\text{PG}(5,q)$ that meets the quadric Veronesean in
at least one point; two such nets are then equivalent if and only if the
corresponding planes belong to the same orbit under the induced action of
$\text{PGL}(3,q)$ viewed as a subgroup of $\text{PGL}(6,q)$. We have previously
determined the orbits of lines in $\text{PG}(5,q)$ under this action, which
correspond to the aforementioned pencils of conics in $\text{PG}(2,q)$. The
main contribution of this paper is to determine the line-orbit distribution of
a plane $\pi$ corresponding to a net of rank one, namely, the number of lines
in $\pi$ belonging to each line orbit. It turns out that this list of
invariants completely determines the orbit of $\pi$, and we will use this fact
in forthcoming work to develop an efficient algorithm for calculating the orbit
of a given net of rank one. As a more immediate application, we also determine
the stabilisers of nets of rank one in $\text{PGL}(3,q)$, and hence the orbit
sizes.

contribute to the final performance metrics. Within the category of neural

for the model being trained and the training approach used. This work focuses
on the third component, the data used during training. The primary questions
that arise are ``what is in the data'' and ``what within the data matters?''
Looking into the Radio Frequency Machine Learning (RFML) field of Automatic
Modulation Classification (AMC) as an example of a tool used for situational
awareness, the use of synthetic, captured, and augmented data are examined and
compared to provide insights about the quantity and quality of the available
data necessary to achieve desired performance levels. There are three questions
discussed within this work: (1) how useful a synthetically trained system is
expected to be when deployed without considering the environment within the
synthesis, (2) how can augmentation be leveraged within the RFML domain, and
lastly, (3) what impact knowledge of degradations to the signal caused by the
transmission channel contributes to the performance of a system. In general,
the examined data types each have useful contributions to a final application,
but captured data germane to the intended use case will always provide more
significant information and enable the greatest performance. Despite the
benefit of captured data, the difficulties and costs that arise from live
collection often make the quantity of data needed to achieve peak performance
impractical. This paper helps quantify the balance between real and synthetic
data, offering concrete examples where training data is parametrically varied
in size and source.

and Rayleigh-Jeans dust emission (excess microwave emission, EME), and often
called `anomalous microwave emission', is bright in molecular cloud regions
exposed to UV radiation, i.e. in photo-dissociation regions (PDRs). The EME
correlates with IR dust emission on degree angular scales. Resolved
observations of well-studied PDRs are needed to compare the spectral variations
of the cm-continuum with tracers of physical conditions and of the dust grain
population. The EME is particularly bright in the regions of the rho Ophiuchi
molecular cloud (rho Oph) that surround the earliest type star in the complex,
HD 147889, where the peak signal stems from the filament known as the rho Oph-W
PDR. Here we report on ATCA observations of rho Oph-W that resolve the width of
the filament. We recover extended emission using a variant of non-parametric
image synthesis performed in the sky plane. The multi-frequency 17 GHz to 39
GHz mosaics reveal spectral variations in the cm-wavelength continuum. At ~30
arcsec resolutions, the 17-20 GHz intensities follow tightly the mid-IR, Icm
propto I(8 um), despite the breakdown of this correlation on larger scales.
However, while the 33-39 GHz filament is parallel to IRAC 8 mum, it is offset
by 15-20 arcsec towards the UV source. Such morphological differences in
frequency reflect spectral variations, which we quantify spectroscopically as a
sharp and steepening high-frequency cutoff, interpreted in terms of the
spinning dust emission mechanism as a minimum grain size a_cutoff ~ 6 +- 1A
that increases deeper into the PDR.

  Memory Models","8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables",,,,"cs.SI physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The COVID-19 epidemic has swept the world for over a year. However, a large
number of infectious asymptomatic COVID-19 cases (\textit{ACC}s) are still
making the breaking up of the transmission chains very difficult. Efforts by
epidemiological researchers in many countries have thrown light on the clinical
features of ACCs, but there is still a lack of practical approaches to detect
ACCs so as to help contain the pandemic. To address the issue of ACCs, this
paper presents a neural network model called Spatio-Temporal Episodic Memory
for COVID-19 (\textit{STEM-COVID}) to identify ACCs from contact tracing data.
Based on the fusion Adaptive Resonance Theory (\textit{ART}), the model encodes
a collective spatio-temporal episodic memory of individuals and incorporates an
effective mechanism of parallel searches for ACCs. Specifically, the episodic
traces of the identified positive cases are used to map out the episodic traces
of suspected ACCs using a weighted evidence pooling method. To evaluate the
efficacy of STEM-COVID, a realistic agent based simulation model for COVID-19
spreading is implemented based on the recent epidemiological findings on ACCs.
The experiments based on rigorous simulation scenarios, manifesting the current
situation of COVID-19 spread, show that the STEM-COVID model with weighted
evidence pooling has a higher level of accuracy and efficiency for identifying
ACCs when compared with several baselines. Moreover, the model displays strong
robustness against noisy data and different ACC proportions, which partially
reflects the effect of breakthrough infections after vaccination on the virus
transmission.

number ($Ra$) range $10^{7} \le Ra \le 10^{8}$ and Prandtl number ($Pr$) range
$2.0 \le Pr \le 20.0$. We found that a new, long-lived, chaotic flow state
exists, in addition to the commonly observed circulation states (the LSC in the
clockwise and counterclockwise directions). The circulation states consist of
one primary roll in the middle and two secondary rolls near the top and bottom
circular walls. The primary roll becomes stronger and larger, while the two
secondary rolls diminish, with increasing $Ra$. Our results suggest that the
reversal of the LSC is accompanied by the secondary rolls growing, breaking the
primary roll and then connecting to form a new primary roll with reversed
direction. We mapped out the phase diagram of the existence of the LSC and the
reversal in the $Ra$-$Pr$ space, which reveals that the flow is in the
circulation states when $Ra$ is large and $Pr$ is small. The reversal of the
LSC can only occur in a limited $Pr$ range. The phase diagram can be understood
in terms of competition between the thermal and viscous diffusions. We also
found that the internal flow states manifested themselves into global
properties such as Nusselt and Reynolds numbers.

operating with low power. Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar
technology is known to achieve high performance sensing by probing with
multiple orthogonal waveforms. However, implementing a low cost low power MIMO
radar is challenging. One of the reasons for this difficulty stems from the
increased cost and power consumption required by analog-to-digital convertors
(ADCs) in acquiring the multiple waveforms at the radar receiver. In this work
we study reduced cost MIMO radar receivers restricted to operate with low
resolution ADCs. We design bit-limited MIMO radar (BiLiMO) receivers which are
capable of accurately recovering their targets while operating under strict
resolution constraints. This is achieved by applying an additional analog
filter to the acquired waveforms, and designing the overall hybrid
analog-digital system to facilitate target identification using task-based
quantization methods. In particular, we exploit the fact that the target
parameters can be recovered from a compressed representation of the received
waveforms. We thus tune the acquisition system to recover this representation
with minimal distortion, from which the targets can be extracted in digital,
and characterize the achievable error in identifying the targets. Our numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed BiLiMO receiver operating with a bit
budget of one bit per sample achieves target recovery performance which
approaches that of costly MIMO radars operating with unlimited resolution ADCs,
while substantially outperforming MIMO receivers operating only in the digital
domain under the same bit limitations.

make firm spin and parity assignments to the isomer and states populated in its
decay, and investigate the structure of the nucleus. Methods: The 145Sm isomer
was populated in the 124Sn(26Mg,5n) reaction. Gamma-ray and conversion-electron
data were collected using the Solenogam array. Results: A revised lifetime of
t1/2 = 3.52(16) mus was measured for the high-spin isomer. Several new states
have been added to the level scheme, and a new state at 8815 keV is proposed as
the isomer, based on decay-property systematics, transition strengths, and spin

The interpretation of the 49/2+ isomer as a deformed excitation of the core

  In this paper, we propose an anonymous trust-marking scheme on blockchain

entities called token admitters are allowed to generate tokens adding
trustworthiness or untrustworthiness to addresses. Anyone can anonymously
verify whether these tokens were issued by a token admitter. Simultaneously,

can identify the token admitters. Our scheme is based on accountable ring

Moreover, we also confirm that our scheme is applicable to Bitcoin, Ethereum,

This paper deals with a trajectory optimization approach for dynamical systems
subject to measurement noise that can be fitted into linear time-varying
stochastic models. Exact/complete solutions to these kind of control problems
have been deemed analytically intractable in literature because they come under
the category of Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).
Therefore, effective solutions with reasonable approximations are widely sought
for. We propose a reformulation of stochastic control in a reinforcement
learning setting. This type of formulation assimilates the benefits of
conventional optimal control procedure, with the advantages of maximum
likelihood approaches. Finally, an iterative trajectory optimization paradigm
called as Stochastic Optimal Control - Expectation Maximization (SOC-EM) is
put-forth. This trajectory optimization procedure exhibits better performance
in terms of reduction of cumulative cost-to-go which is proved both
theoretically and empirically. Furthermore, we also provide novel theoretical
work which is related to uniqueness of control parameter estimates. Analysis of
the control covariance matrix is presented, which handles stochasticity through
efficiently balancing exploration and exploitation.

Notably, the ParA motor is required to prevent the fusion of ParB condensates.

In this era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computing, systematic
miscalibrations, drift, and crosstalk in the control of qubits can lead to a
coherent form of error which has no classical analog. Coherent errors severely
limit the performance of quantum algorithms in an unpredictable manner, and
mitigating their impact is necessary for realizing reliable quantum
computations. Moreover, the average error rates measured by randomized
benchmarking and related protocols are not sensitive to the full impact of
coherent errors, and therefore do not reliably predict the global performance
of quantum algorithms, leaving us unprepared to validate the accuracy of future
large-scale quantum computations. Randomized compiling is a protocol designed
to overcome these performance limitations by converting coherent errors into
stochastic noise, dramatically reducing unpredictable errors in quantum
algorithms and enabling accurate predictions of algorithmic performance from
error rates measured via cycle benchmarking. In this work, we demonstrate
significant performance gains under randomized compiling for the four-qubit
quantum Fourier transform algorithm and for random circuits of variable depth
on a superconducting quantum processor. Additionally, we accurately predict
algorithm performance using experimentally-measured error rates. Our results
demonstrate that randomized compiling can be utilized to leverage and predict

devices, such as memory, sensor, logic gate, and neuromorphic computing
hardware. The high-accuracy determination of the effective spring constant of
the pinning potential, however, remains challenging, because the extrinsic
pinning is often mixed up with intrinsic ones caused by materials defects and
randomness. Here, we study the collective dynamics of interacting DWs in a
racetrack with pinning sites of alternate distances. By mapping the governing
equations of DW motion to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and evaluating the
quantized Zak phase, we predict two topologically distinct phases in the
racetrack. Robust edge state emerges at either one or both ends depending on
the parity of the DW number and the ratio of alternating intersite lengths. We
show that the in-gap DW oscillation frequency has a fixed value which depends
only on the geometrical shape of the pinning notch, and is insensitive to
device imperfections and inhomogeneities. We propose to accurately quantify the
spring coefficient that equals the square of the robust DW frequency multiplied
by its constant mass. Our findings suggest as well that the DW racetrack is an
ideal platform to study the topological phase transition.

that during the evolution of spiral galaxies the velocity of motion of the
outer stars does not decrease with increasing distance from the galactic

the dependence of this phenomenon on dark matter would be correspondingly
reduced. This means that the ratio of dark matter to regular matter in spiral
galaxies may not be as large as the commonly believed 5:1 ratio, and this
phenomenon should be more widespread in late-evolutionary spiral galaxies than
in early-evolutionary spiral galaxies. The influence of the quantum
characteristic of gravity on the evolution of spiral galaxies is a complex
progress, which will be discussed in detail in third part of the paper, while
the first and second parts focus on the quantum characteristic of gravity, and
their verification methods. The first part focus on a possible method to verify
whether gravity has quantum characteristic by using the kinematic time dilation

that the kinematic time dilation effect will be affected by gravitational

We performed a new membership analysis of the Lupus association based on

molecular clouds of the complex and compared the properties of the various
subgroups in this region. Results: We identified 137 high-probability members
of the Lupus association of young stars, including 47 stars that had never been
reported as members before. Many of the historically known stars associated
with the Lupus region identified in previous studies are more likely to be
field stars or members of the adjacent Scorpius-Centaurus association. Our new
sample of members covers the magnitude and mass range from G=8 to G=18 mag and
from 0.03 to 2.4Msun, respectively. We compared the kinematic properties of the
stars projected towards the molecular clouds Lupus 1 to 6 and showed that these
subgroups are located at roughly the same distance (about 160~pc) and move with
the same spatial velocity. Our age estimates inferred from stellar models show
that the Lupus subgroups are coeval (with median ages ranging from about 1 to 3
Myr). The Lupus association appears to be younger than the population of young
stars in the Corona-Australis star-forming region recently investigated by our
team using a similar methodology. The initial mass function of the Lupus
association inferred from the distribution of spectral types shows little
variation compared to other star-forming regions.

multi-grained semantics to enhance node representations. The updated node
representations can further adjust the graph representation in the next
iteration. Experiments on 14 real-world graph datasets show that AdamGNN can
significantly outperform 17 competing models on both node- and graph-wise

overcome contributions due to emission, either of dynamical or statistical

de-excitation of the primary fragments introduces a linear transformation at
relatively high excitation energies (above 2\amev{}) when the residue
approaches the Evaporation Attractor Line, while some effect is produced at
lower excitation energies due to the occurrence of some non-linearities. As for

of deep learning models for dealing with semantic scene understanding tasks, it
is vital to train them on large-scale annotated data. However, most existing
datasets are annotated by a single label, which cannot describe the complex
remote sensing images well because scene images might have multiple land cover
classes. Few multi-label high spatial resolution remote sensing datasets have
been developed to train deep learning models for multi-label based tasks, such
as scene classification and image retrieval. To address this issue, in this
paper, we construct a multi-label high spatial resolution remote sensing
dataset named MLRSNet for semantic scene understanding with deep learning from
the overhead perspective. It is composed of high-resolution optical satellite
or aerial images. MLRSNet contains a total of 109,161 samples within 46 scene
categories, and each image has at least one of 60 predefined labels. We have
designed visual recognition tasks, including multi-label based image
classification and image retrieval, in which a wide variety of deep learning
approaches are evaluated with MLRSNet. The experimental results demonstrate
that MLRSNet is a significant benchmark for future research, and it complements
the current widely used datasets such as ImageNet, which fills gaps in
multi-label image research. Furthermore, we will continue to expand the
MLRSNet. MLRSNet and all related materials have been made publicly available at

artistic styles and shape exaggerations while maintaining the identity of the
subject. Different from the generic image-to-image translation, drawing a
caricature automatically is a more challenging task due to the existence of
various spacial deformations. Previous caricature generation methods are
obsessed with predicting definite image warping from a given photo while
ignoring the intrinsic representation and distribution for exaggerations in
caricatures. This limits their ability on diverse exaggeration generation. In
this paper, we generalize the caricature generation problem from instance-level
warping prediction to distribution-level deformation modeling. Based on this
assumption, we present the first exploration for unpaired CARIcature generation
with Multiple Exaggerations (CariMe). Technically, we propose a
Multi-exaggeration Warper network to learn the distribution-level mapping from
photo to facial exaggerations. This makes it possible to generate diverse and
reasonable exaggerations from randomly sampled warp codes given one input
photo. To better represent the facial exaggeration and produce fine-grained
warping, a deformation-field-based warping method is also proposed, which helps
us to capture more detailed exaggerations than other point-based warping
methods. Experiments and two perceptual studies prove the superiority of our
method comparing with other state-of-the-art methods, showing the improvement
of our work on caricature generation.

given. Such geometry is useful to study the magnetosphere of neutron stars for
which more and more compelling observations reveals hints for at least

predicted gap in the black hole mass function from approximately $50$ to $140
M_\odot$. Yet the LIGO and Virgo Collaborations[1] recently discovered black
holes of masses $66 M_\odot$ and $85 M_\odot$ in the gravitational wave event
GW190521. We propose a new method to populate the BH mass gap. If an energy
source is added throughout the star in addition to nuclear fusion, it is
possible for the altered evolution to avoid the complete destruction of a pair
instability supernova, and instead a BH remnant is left behind. An example of
an extra energy source is dark matter annihilation within the star, but our
results hold more generally. We show this phenomenon by exploring the effect of
adding an energy source independent of temperature and density to a $180
M_\odot$ star, using the MESA one-dimensional stellar evolution software. If
$\sim50$\% of the star's energy is due to this new source, the star is capable
of avoiding the pair instability entirely and evolving towards a core-collapse
supernova and ultimately a BH remnant with mass $\sim 120 M_\odot$.

which fabricates ancilla for running $T$ gates with high accuracy but consumes
a lot of specially prepared ancilla qubits and a lot of time. Thus, we must
reduce the number of $T$ gates. We propose a new control modular adder that
uses only 20% of the number of $T$ gates of the original. Moreover, when we
take distillation into consideration, we find that we minimize $\text{KQ}_{T}$

demonstrate the practicality and sensitivity of this approach by studying
nonclassicality of a family of noisy and lossy quantum states of light. To this

the reconstructed Wigner and Husimi Q functions, the inequality conditions
detect nonclassicality despite the fact that the involved distributions are

mutation operator that should be used for MOEA/D-DE has not been thoroughly
investigated in the literature. This configuration choice confuses researchers

evolution. The high precision parallax data of the Gaia mission allows
significant improvements in the distance determination to stellar clusters and
its stars. In order to have accurate and precise distance determinations,
systematics like the parallax spatial correlations need to be accounted for,
especially for stars in small sky regions. Aims: Provide the astrophysical
community with a free and open code designed to simultaneously infer cluster
parameters (i.e. distance and size) and the distances to its stars using Gaia
parallax measurements. It includes cluster oriented prior families and is
specifically designed to deal with the Gaia parallax spatial correlations.
Methods: A Bayesian hierarchical model is created to allow the inference of
both the cluster parameters and distances to its stars. Results: Using
synthetic data that mimics Gaia parallax uncertainties and spatial
correlations, we observe that our cluster oriented prior families result in
distance estimates with smaller errors than those obtained with an
exponentially decreasing space density prior. In addition, the treatment of the
parallax spatial correlations minimizes errors in the estimated cluster size
and stellar distances and avoids the underestimation of uncertainties. Although
neglecting the parallax spatial correlations has no impact on the accuracy of
cluster distance determinations, it underestimates the uncertainties and may
result in measurements that are incompatible with the true value. Conclusions:
The combination of prior knowledge with the treatment of Gaia parallax spatial
correlations produces accurate (error <10%) and trustworthy estimates (i.e.
true values contained within the 2$\sigma$ uncertainties) of clusters distances
for clusters up to ~5 kpc, and cluster sizes for clusters up to ~1 kpc.

of observable variables. Probabilistic programs are usually conditioned on
samples from the joint data distribution, which we refer to as deterministic
conditioning. However, in many real-life scenarios, the observations are given
as marginal distributions, summary statistics, or samplers. Conventional
probabilistic programming systems lack adequate means for modeling and
inference in such scenarios. We propose a generalization of deterministic
conditioning to stochastic conditioning, that is, conditioning on the marginal
distribution of a variable taking a particular form. To this end, we first
define the formal notion of stochastic conditioning and discuss its key
properties. We then show how to perform inference in the presence of stochastic
conditioning. We demonstrate potential usage of stochastic conditioning on
several case studies which involve various kinds of stochastic conditioning and
are difficult to solve otherwise. Although we present stochastic conditioning

  Modelling the earth's geomagnetic environment on Cray machines using PETSc

Earth's Magnetic Environment (MEME), is an important tool for calculating the
earth's magnetic field, which is continually in flux. Whilst the ability to
collect data from ground based observation sites and satellites has grown, the
memory bound nature of the code has proved a limitation in modelling problem
sizes required by modern science. In this paper we describe work replacing the
bespoke, sequential, eigen-solver with that of the SLEPc package for solving
the system of normal equations. This work had a dual purpose, to break through
the memory limit of the code, and thus support the modelling of much larger
systems, by supporting execution on distributed machines, and to improve
performance. But when adopting SLEPc it was not just the solving of the normal
equations, but also fundamentally how we build and distribute the data
structures. We describe an approach for building symmetric matrices in a way
that provides good load balance and avoids the need for close co-ordination
between processes or replication of work. We also study the memory bound nature
of the code and combine detailed profiling with software cache prefetching to
significantly optimise. Performance and scaling are explored on ARCHER, a Cray
XC30, where we achieve a speed up for the solver of 294 times by replacing the
model's bespoke approach with SLEPc. This work also provided the ability to
model much larger system sizes, up to 100,000 model coefficients. Some of the
challenges of modelling systems of this large scale are explored, and
mitigations including hybrid MPI+OpenMP along with the use of iterative solvers
are also considered. The result of this work is a modern MEME model that is not
only capable of simulating problem sizes demanded by state of the art
geomagnetism but also acts as further evidence to the utility of the SLEPc
libary.

probabilistic programming was shown to be capable of policy search in partially
observable domains. Prior work introduces policy search through Markov chain
Monte Carlo in deterministic domains, as well as adapts black-box variational
inference to stochastic domains, however not in the strictly Bayesian sense. In
this work, we cast policy search in stochastic domains as a Bayesian inference
problem and provide a scheme for encoding such problems as nested probabilistic
programs. We argue that probabilistic programs for policy search in stochastic
domains should involve nested conditioning, and provide an adaption of
Lightweight Metropolis-Hastings (LMH) for robust inference in such programs. We
apply the proposed scheme to stochastic domains and show that policies of
similar quality are learned, despite a simpler and more general inference
algorithm. We believe that the proposed variant of LMH is novel and applicable
to a wider class of probabilistic programs with nested conditioning.

approximated domain-decomposition of the target geometry into a number of
subdomains obtained from the parametrized deformation of geometrical building
blocks (e.g. straight tubes and model bifurcations). On each of these building
blocks, we build a set of spectral functions by proper orthogonal decomposition
of a large number of snapshots of finite element solutions (offline phase). The
global solution of the Navier-Stokes equations on a target geometry is then
found by coupling linear combinations of these local basis functions by means
of spectral Lagrange multipliers (online phase). Being that the number of
reduced degrees of freedom is considerably smaller than their finite element
counterpart, this approach allows us to significantly decrease the size of the
linear system to be solved in each iteration of the Newton-Raphson algorithm.
We achieve large speedups with respect to the full order simulation (in our
numerical experiments, the gain is at least of one order of magnitude and grows
inversely with respect to the reduced basis size), whilst still retaining
satisfactory accuracy for most cardiovascular simulations.

reconfigurable computing with communities such as HPC, Xilinx have recently

whether the tooling is mature enough such that software developers using FPGAs
to accelerate their codes is now a more realistic proposition, or whether it
simply increases the convenience for existing experts. To examine this question
we use the Himeno benchmark as a vehicle for exploring the Vitis platform for
building, executing and optimising HPC codes, describing the different steps
and potential pitfalls of the technology. The outcome of this exploration is a
demonstration that, whilst Vitis is an excellent step forwards and
significantly lowers the barrier to entry in developing codes for FPGAs, it is
not a silver bullet and an underlying understanding of dataflow style
algorithmic design and appreciation of the architecture is still key to
obtaining good performance on reconfigurable architectures.

particular image. Furthermore, we show how to adapt our method to the modelling
of label noise in each of the sub-problems associated to DR grading, an
approach we refer to as Atomic Sub-Task modeling. This yields models that can
implicitly take into account the inherent noise present in DR grade
annotations. Our experimental analysis on several public datasets reveals that,

spontaneous synchronization. These results ascribe a clear physical meaning of

their scientific merit, these models are often used to inform political
decisions and intervention measures during an ongoing outbreak. However,
reliably inferring the dynamics of ongoing outbreaks by connecting complex
models to real data is still hard and requires either laborious manual
parameter fitting or expensive optimization methods which have to be repeated
from scratch for every application of a given model. In this work, we address
this problem with a novel combination of epidemiological modeling with
specialized neural networks. Our approach entails two computational phases: In
an initial training phase, a mathematical model describing the epidemic is used
as a coach for a neural network, which acquires global knowledge about the full
range of possible disease dynamics. In the subsequent inference phase, the
trained neural network processes the observed data of an actual outbreak and
infers the parameters of the model in order to realistically reproduce the
observed dynamics and reliably predict future progression. With its flexible
framework, our simulation-based approach is applicable to a variety of
epidemiological models. Moreover, since our method is fully Bayesian, it is
designed to incorporate all available prior knowledge about plausible parameter
values and returns complete joint posterior distributions over these
parameters. Application of our method to the early Covid-19 outbreak phase in
Germany demonstrates that we are able to obtain reliable probabilistic
estimates for important disease characteristics, such as generation time,
fraction of undetected infections, likelihood of transmission before symptom
onset, and reporting delays using a very moderate amount of real-world

generation per land area than horizontal axis turbines farms, due to the
positive synergy between VATs in close proximity. Theoretical wake models
enable the reliable design of the array layout that maximises the energy
output, which need to depict the driving wake dynamics. VAWTs generate a highly
complex wake that evolves according to two governing length-scales, namely the
turbine rotor's diameter and height which define a rectangular shape of the
wake cross-section, and feature distinct wake expansion rates. This paper
presents analytical VAWT wake models that account for an asymmetric
distribution of such wake expansion adopting a top-hat and Gaussian velocity
deficit distribution. Our proposed analytical Gaussian model leads to an
enhanced initial wake expansion prediction with the wake width ($\varepsilon$)
behind the rotor equal to $(\beta/4 \pi)^{1/2}$ with $\beta$ being the ratio of
initial wake area to the VAWT's frontal area, which addresses the limitations
of previous models that under-predicted the wake onset area. Velocity deficit
predictions are calculated in a series of numerical benchmarks consisting of a
single and an array of four in-line vertical axis wind turbines. In comparisons
with field data and large-eddy simulations, our models provide a good accuracy
to represent the mean wake distribution, maximum velocity deficit, and momentum
thickness, with the Gaussian model attaining the best predictions.These models
will aid to drive the design of VAT arrays and accelerate this technology.

that the electronic document authorship protection can be implemented by
digital watermark embedding in the images that are contained in this document.
The paper considers three cases of using the proposed technology: full copying
of an electronic document, copying of images contained in the document, and
copying of text. It is shown that in all three cases the authorship
confirmation can be successfully implemented. Computational experiments are
conducted with robust watermarking algorithms that can be used within the
technology. A scenario of technology implementation is proposed, which provides
for the joint use of different class algorithms.

standard FDG reconstruction parameters has been shown to predict response.
  Methods: The hot rods insert of a Jaszczak deluxe phantom was partially
filled with a 2.65 GBq 90Y - 300ml DTPA water solution resulting in a 100 Gy
mean absorbed dose in the 6 sectors. A two bed 20min/position acquisition was
performed on a 550ps- and on a 320ps- TOF-PET/CT and reconstructed with
standard FDG reconstruction parameters, without and with additional filtering.
The whole procedure was repeated on both PET after adding a 300ml of water
(50Gy setup). The phantom was acquired again after decay by a factor 10 (5Gy
setup), but with 200min per bed position. For comparison the phantom was also
acquired with 18F activity corresponding to a clinical FDG whole body
acquisition.
  Results: The 100Gy-setup provided hot rod sectors image almost as good as in
18F phantom. However, despite acquisition time compensation the 5Gy-setup
provides much lower quality imaging. TOF-PET based sectors EUDs for the three
large rod sectors were in agreement with the actual EUDs computed with a
radiosensitivity 0.021Gy-1 well in the range observed in external beam
radiotherapy (EBRT), i.e. 0.01-0.04Gy-1. This agreement explains the
reunification of the dose-response relationships of the glass and resin spheres
in HCC using the TOF-PET based EUD. Additional filtering reduced the EUDs
agreement quality.
  Conclusions: Standard FDG reconstruction parameters are suitable in TOF-PET
post 90Y liver radioembolization for accurate tumor EUD computation. The
present results clearly rules out the use of low specific activity phantom
studies to optimize reconstruction parameters.

faced difficulties in balancing infection control with economics. Due to
limited prior knowledge, economists began researching this issue using
cost-benefit analysis and found that infection control processes significantly
affect economic efficiency. A UK study used economic parameters to numerically
demonstrate an optimal balance in the process, including keeping the infected
population stationary. However, universally applicable knowledge, which is
indispensable for the guiding principles of infection control, has not yet been
clearly developed because of the methodological limitations of simulation
studies. Here, we propose a simple model and theoretically prove the universal
result of economic irreversibility by applying the idea of thermodynamics to
pandemic control. This means that delaying infection control measures is more
expensive than implementing infection control measures early while keeping
infected populations stationary. This implies that once the infected population
increases, society cannot return to its previous state without extra
expenditures. This universal result is analytically obtained by focusing on the
infection-spreading phase of pandemics, and is applicable not just to COVID-19,
regardless of ""herd immunity."" It also confirms the numerical observation of
stationary infected populations in its optimally efficient process. Our
findings suggest that economic irreversibility is a guiding principle for
balancing infection control with economic effects.

recently attracted a great interest because of unusual mechanisms of the charge

superconducting phases in the periodically strained CNG and the magic angle
twisted bilayer graphene or for formation of graphene plasmon polaritons (GPPs)
associated with interband transitions due to the strain-induced pseudomagnetic
field. Importantly, GPP in CNG can be a tool providing new insights into
various intriguing quantum phenomena in CNG via optical experiments. However,
interband GPPs in CNG are barely investigated, even in the simplest
configurations. Here, we show that magnetically biased single layer CNG
(particularly, at zero temperature) can support interband GPPs of both
transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations. They exist inside
the narrow absorption bands originating from the electronic transitions between
Landau levels and are tunable by the external magnetic field. We put our study
into the context of potential near-field and far-field optical experiments,
thus opening the door to the exploration of CNG for optics and nanophotonics.

AQP problems that are given parameters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, and return
estimated results within a factor of 1+$\epsilon$ of the true results with
error probability at most $\delta$. In particular, the lower bounds for
cardinality estimation over joins under various settings are contained in our

joins, unless restricted to the set of queries whose results are always
guaranteed to be above a very large threshold, the amount of information an AQP
algorithm needs for returning an accurate approximation is at least linear in
the number of rows in the largest table. Similar lower bounds even hold for
some special cases where additional information such as top-K heavy hitters and
all frequency vectors are available. In the case of GROUP-BY where the query

extracts the knowledge context of an entity from large-scale knowledge bases.
To handle the heterogeneity of knowledge context and language context, we
integrate them in a unified data structure, word-knowledge graph (WK graph).
CoLAKE is pre-trained on large-scale WK graphs with the modified Transformer

tasks, and language understanding tasks. Experimental results show that CoLAKE
outperforms previous counterparts on most of the tasks. Besides, CoLAKE
achieves surprisingly high performance on our synthetic task called

dark matter haloes, which appear approximately elliptical in projection. Weak
gravitational lensing allows us to constrain these halo shapes and thereby test
the nature of dark matter. Weak lensing has already provided robust detections
of the signature of halo flattening at the mass scales of groups and clusters,
whereas results for galaxies have been somewhat inconclusive. Here we combine
data from five surveys (NGVSLenS, KiDS/KV450, CFHTLenS, CS82, and RCSLenS) in
order to tighten observational constraints on galaxy-scale halo ellipticity for
photometrically selected lens samples. We constrain $f_\rm{h}$, the average
ratio between the aligned component of the halo ellipticity and the ellipticity
of the light distribution, finding $f_\rm{h}=0.303^{+0.080}_{-0.079}$ for red
lenses and $f_\rm{h}=0.217^{+0.160}_{-0.159}$ for blue lenses when assuming
elliptical NFW density profiles and a linear scaling between halo ellipticity
and galaxy ellipticity. Our constraints for red galaxies constitute the
currently most significant ($3.8\sigma$) systematics-corrected detection of the
signature of halo flattening at the mass scale of galaxies. Our results are in
good agreement with expectations from the Millennium Simulation that apply the
same analysis scheme and incorporate models for galaxy-halo misalignment.
Assuming these misalignment models and the analysis assumptions stated above
are correct, our measurements imply an average dark matter halo ellipticity for
the studied red galaxy samples of $\langle|\epsilon_\rm{h}|\rangle=0.174\pm
0.046$, where $|\epsilon_{h}|=(1-q)/(1+q)$ relates to the ratio $q=b/a$ of the
minor and major axes of the projected mass distribution. Similar measurements
based on larger upcoming weak lensing data sets can help to calibrate models
for intrinsic galaxy alignments. [abridged]

$AG(2,q)$. Later, G. Kyureghyan, et al.\cite{KLP} proceeded to consider the

three polynomials over $\F_{q}$ with $q$ both odd and even. They also proposed
several conjectures in \cite{KLP}.
  In this paper, we completely solve two conjectures in \cite{KLP}. Namely, we
prove two classes of power functions having intersection distribution:
$v_{0}(f)=\frac{q(q-1)}{3},~v_{1}(f)=\frac{q(q+1)}{2},~v_{2}(f)=0,~v_{3}(f)=\frac{q(q-1)}{6}$.
We mainly make use of the multivariate method and QM-equivalence on $2$-to-$1$

accuracy. It is able to observe with any of the four Unit Telescopes (UT) of
the VLT at a spectral resolving power of 140,000 or 190,000 over the 378.2 to

installed on the Paranal Observatory in fall 2017. Commissioning (on-sky
testing) was conducted between December 2017 and September 2018. The instrument
saw its official start of operations on October 1st, 2018, but improvements to
the instrument and re-commissioning runs were conducted until July 2019. The
measured overall optical throughput of ESPRESSO at 550 nm and a seeing of 0.65
arcsec exceeds the 10% mark under nominal astro-climatic conditions. We
demonstrate a radial-velocity precision of better than 25 cm/s during one night
and 50 cm/s over several months. These values being limited by photon noise and
stellar jitter show that the performanceis compatible with an instrumental
precision of 10 cm/s. No difference has been measured across the UTs neither in
throughput nor RV precision. The combination of the large collecting telescope
area with the efficiency and the exquisite spectral fidelity of ESPRESSO opens

Using 20 long and 22 short bursts with extended emission, we find that the
popular $\gamma$-ray energy correlations of the intrinsic peak energy versus
the isotropic energy (Amati relation) and the intrinsic peak energy versus the
peak luminosity (Yonetoku relation) do exist in either short or long bursts.
However, these gamma-ray bursts with extended emissions are much better to be
reclassified into two subgroups of E-I and E-II that make the above energy
correlations more tight. As proposed by Zhang et al. (2018), the energy
correlations can be utilized to distinguish these kinds of gamma-ray bursts in
the plane of bolometric fluence versus peak energy as well. Interestingly, the
peculiar short GRB 170817A belongs to the E-I group in the fluence versus peak
energy plane, but it is an outlier of both Amati and Yonetoku relations even
though the off-axis effect has been corrected. Furthermore, we compare the
radiation features between the extended emissions and the prompt gamma-rays in
order to search for their possible connections. Taking into account all these
factors, we conclude that gamma-ray bursts with extended emission are still
required to model with dichotomic groups, namely E-I and E-II classes,

consequences thereby questioning the benefits of this technology. It is
currently highly challenging to fix errors and deploy a patched contract in

online due to the distributed nature of blockchain systems. They also manage
considerable amounts of assets, which are at risk and often beyond recovery
after an attack. Existing solutions to upgrade smart contracts depend on manual
and error-prone processes. This paper presents a framework, called EVMPatch, to
instantly and automatically patch faulty smart contracts. EVMPatch features a
bytecode rewriting engine for the popular Ethereum blockchain, and
transparently/automatically rewrites common off-the-shelf contracts to
upgradable contracts. The proof-of-concept implementation of EVMPatch
automatically hardens smart contracts that are vulnerable to integer
over/underflows and access control errors, but can be easily extended to cover
more bug classes. Our extensive evaluation on 14,000 real-world (vulnerable)
contracts demonstrate that our approach successfully blocks attack transactions
launched on these contracts, while keeping the intended functionality of the
contract intact. We perform a study with experienced software developers,
showing that EVMPatch is practical, and reduces the time for converting a given
Solidity smart contract to an upgradable contract by 97.6 %, while ensuring
functional equivalence to the original contract.

  in Graphs",,,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Permutation $\sigma$ appears in permutation $\pi$ if there exists a
subsequence of $\pi$ that is order-isomorphic to $\sigma$. The natural question
is to check if $\sigma$ appears in $\pi$, and if so count the number of
occurrences. We know that for any fixed length~k, we can check if a given
pattern of length k appears in a permutation of length n in time linear in n,
but being able to count all such occurrences in $f(k)\cdot n^{o(k/\log k)}$
time would refute the exponential time hypothesis (ETH). This motivates a
systematic study of the complexity of counting occurrences for different
patterns of fixed small length k. We investigate this question for k=4. Very
recently, Even-Zohar and Leng [arXiv 2019] identified two types of 4-patterns.
For the first type they designed an $\~O(n)$ time algorithm, while for the
second they were able to provide an $\~O(n^{1.5})$ time algorithm. This brings
up the question whether the permutations of the second type are inherently
harder than the first type.
  We establish a connection between counting 4-patterns of the second type and
counting 4-cycles in a sparse undirected graph. By designing two-way reductions
we show that the complexities of both problems are the same, up to
polylogarithmic factors. This allows us to provide a reasonable argument for
why there is a difference in the complexities for counting 4-patterns of the
two types. In particular, even for the simpler problem of detecting a 4-cycle
in a graph on m edges, the best known algorithm works in $O(m^{4/3})$ time. Our
reductions imply that an $O(n^{4/3-\varepsilon})$ time algorithm for counting
occurrences would imply an exciting breakthrough for counting (and hence also
detecting) 4-cycles. In the other direction, by plugging in the fastest known
algorithm for counting 4-cycles, we obtain an algorithm for counting
occurrences of any 4-pattern in $O(n^{1.48})$ time.

ferromagnetic single-phase multiferroic with large, strongly coupled,

nearly energy-degenerate ground states with mutually orthogonal vector order
parameters (polarization, magnetization, ferrotoroidicity), which can be
rotated globally by switching between ground states. Giant cross-coupling
magnetoelectric and magnetotoroidic effects, as well as optical
non-reciprocity, are thus expected. Importantly, Bi$_5$Mn$_5$O$_{17}$ should be
thermodynamically stable in O-rich growth conditions, and hence experimentally

cancer diagnosis and therapies but, to start this revolution, software tools

are becoming a commodity in Python and Matlab libraries, just to name two, but
to exploit all their possibilities, it is essential to fully understand how
models are interpreted and which models are more interpretable than others. In
this survey, we analyse current machine learning models, frameworks, databases
and other related tools as applied to medicine - specifically, to cancer
research - and we discuss their interpretability, performance and the necessary

be the preferred models. Besides, CNNs, supported by the rapid development of

platforms and the Wi-Fi domain. In this paper, we present ReactiFi, a
high-level reactive programming language to program Wi-Fi chips on mobile
consumer devices. ReactiFi enables programmers to implement extensions of PHY,
MAC, and IP layer mechanisms without requiring expert knowledge of Wi-Fi chips,
allowing for novel applications and network protocols. ReactiFi programs are
executed directly on the Wi-Fi chip, improving performance and power
consumption compared to execution on the main CPU. ReactiFi is conceptually
similar to functional reactive languages, but is dedicated to the
domain-specific needs of Wi-Fi firmware. First, it handles low-level
platform-specific details without interfering with the core functionality of
Wi-Fi chips. Second, it supports static reasoning about memory usage of
applications, which is important for typically memory-constrained Wi-Fi chips.
Third, it limits dynamic changes of dependencies between computations to
dynamic branching, in order to enable static reasoning about the order of
computations. We evaluate ReactiFi empirically in two real-world case studies.
Our results show that throughput, latency, and power consumption are
significantly improved when executing applications on the Wi-Fi chip rather
than in the operating system kernel or in user space. Moreover, we show that
the high-level programming abstractions of ReactiFi have no performance
overhead compared to manually written C code.

the sparse communication across the clusters. Moreover, each cluster has one
leader which can communicate with other leaders in different clusters. The goal
of the nodes is to agree at some common value under the presence of
communication delays across the clusters.
  Our main contribution is to propose a novel distributed two-time-scale
consensus algorithm, which pertains to the separation in network topology of
clustered networks. In particular, one scale is to model the dynamic of the
agents in each cluster, which is much faster (due to the dense communication)
than the scale describing the slowly aggregated evolution between the clusters
(due to the sparse communication). We prove the convergence of the proposed
method in the presence of uniform, but possibly arbitrarily large,
communication delays between the leaders. In addition, we provided an explicit
formula for the convergence rate of such algorithm, which characterizes the
impact of delays and the network topology. Our results shows that after a
transient time characterized by the topology of each cluster, the convergence
of the two-time-scale consensus method only depends on the connectivity of the
leaders. Finally, we validate our theoretical results by a number of numerical
simulations on different clustered networks.

arising from the areas of big data analysis, computer vision, and network
engineering. Due to the multidimensional nature of high-order tensors, the
matrix approaches, e.g., matrix factorization and direct matricization of
tensors, are often not ideal for tensor completion and recovery. In this paper,
we introduce a unified low-rank and sparse enhanced Tucker decomposition model
for tensor completion. Our model possesses a sparse regularization term to
promote a sparse core tensor of the Tucker decomposition, which is beneficial
for tensor data compression. Moreover, we enforce low-rank regularization terms
on factor matrices of the Tucker decomposition for inducing the low-rankness of
the tensor with a cheap computational cost. Numerically, we propose a
customized ADMM with enough easy subproblems to solve the underlying model. It
is remarkable that our model is able to deal with different types of real-world
data sets, since it exploits the potential periodicity and inherent correlation
properties appeared in tensors. A series of computational experiments on
real-world data sets, including internet traffic data sets, color images, and
face recognition, demonstrate that our model performs better than many existing
state-of-the-art matricization and tensorization approaches in terms of
achieving higher recovery accuracy.

existence of steady patterns, standing waves, modulated waves and travelling
waves, where the values of coefficients of the terms in the normal form
classify all possible different bifurcation scenarios in the neighbourhood of
the TB bifurcation (Dangelmayr & Knobloch, 1987). In this work we develop a new
and simple pattern-forming PDE model, based on the Swift-Hohenberg equation,
adapted to have the TB normal form at onset, which allows us to explore the
dynamics in a wide range of bifurcation scenarios, including in domains much
wider than the lengthscale of the pattern. We identify two bifurcation
scenarios in which coexistence between different types of solutions is
indicated from the analysis of the normal form equation. In these scenarios, we
look for spatially localised solutions by examining pattern formation in wide
domains. We recover two types of localised states, that of a localised steady
state in the background of the trivial state and that of a spatially localised
travelling wave in the background of the trivial state which have previously
been observed in other systems. Additionally, we identify two new types of
spatially localised states: that of a localised steady state in a modulated
wave background and that of a localised travelling wave in a steady state
background. The PDE model is easy to solve numerically in large domains and so
will allow further investigation of pattern formation with a TB bifurcation in
one or more dimensions and the exploration of a range of background and

different visual beliefs and future questions. However, existing methods always
indiscriminately encode answers after much longer questions, resulting in a
weak utilization of answers. In this paper, we propose an Answer-Driven Visual

the answer-driven effect on visual attention by sharpening question-related

the focus lies on topological defects and topologically protected edge modes
with an emphasis on the distinctive properties they acquire in active media.
These paradigmatic examples represent two physically distinct classes of
phenomena whose robustness can be traced to a common mathematical origin: the
presence of topological invariants. These invariants are typically integer
numbers that cannot be changed by continuous deformations of the relevant order
parameters or physical parameters of the underlying medium. We first explain
the mechanisms whereby topological defects self propel and proliferate in
active nematics, leading to collective states which can be manipulated by
geometry and patterning. Possible implications for active microfluidics and
biological tissues are presented. We then illustrate how the propagation of
waves in active fluids and solids is affected by the presence of topological
invariants characterizing their dispersion relations. We discuss the relevance
of these ideas for the design of robotic metamaterials and the properties of
active granular and colloidal systems. Open theoretical and experimental
challenges are presented as future research prospects.

binary systems whose large (above $10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$) apparent luminosities
are explained by super-Eddington accretion onto a stellar-mass compact object.
Many of the ULXs, especially those containing magnetized neutron stars, are
highly variable; some exhibit transient behaviour. Large luminosities might
imply large accretion discs that could be therefore prone to the
thermal-viscous instability known to drive outbursts of dwarf novae and
low-mass X-ray binary transient sources. The aim of this paper is to extend and
generalize the X-ray transient disc-instability model to the case of large

of the accretion disc is efficient even when the accretion rate exceeds the
Eddington value, possibly due to scattering back of the X-ray flux emitted by
the central parts of the disc on the outer portions of the disc, heating fronts
can reach the disc's outer edge generating high accretion rates. We also
provide analytical approximations for the observable properties of the
outbursts. We have reproduced successfully the observed properties of galactic
transients with large discs, such as V404 Cyg, as well as some ULXs such as M51
XT-1. Our model can reproduce the peak luminosity and decay time of ESO 243-39
HLX-1 outbursts if the accretor is a neutron star. Observational tests of our
predicted relations between the outburst duration and decay time with peak

of electrons and nuclei based on a second quantization representation (SQR) of
the electronic motion combined with the usual representation of the nuclear
coordinates is introduced. This procedure circumvents the introduction of
potential energy surfaces and non-adiabatic couplings, providing an alternative
to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. An important feature of the molecular
Hamiltonian in the mixed first quantized representation for the nuclei and the
SQR representation for the electrons is that all degrees of freedom, nuclear
positions and electronic occupations, are distinguishable. This makes the
approach compatible with various tensor decomposition \emph{ans\""atze} for the
propagation of the nuclear-electronic wavefunction. Here, we describe the
application of this formalism within the multi-configuration time-dependent
Hartree (MCTDH) framework and its multilayer generalization, corresponding to
Tucker and hierarchical Tucker tensor decompositions of the wavefunction,
respectively. The approach is applied to the calculation of the
photodissociation cross-section of the HeH$^+$ molecule under extreme
ultraviolet irradiation, which features non-adiabatic effects and quantum
interferences between the two possible fragmentation channels, He+H$^+$ and
He$^+$+H. These calculations are compared with the usual description based on
ab \emph{ab initio} potential energy surfaces and non-adiabatic coupling matrix
elements, which fully agree. The proof-of-principle calculations serve to
illustrate the advantages and drawbacks of this formalism, which are discussed
in detail, as well as possible ways to overcome them.

  Single stimulus methodology, e.g., the Absolute Category Rating (ACR) has

Comparison (PC) is of significant advantage over ACR in terms of
discriminability. In addition, PC avoids the influence of observers' bias
regarding their understanding of the quality scale. Nevertheless, full pair
comparison is much more time-consuming. In this study, we therefore 1) employ a
generic model to bridge the pair comparison data and ACR data, where the
variance term could be recovered and the obtained information is more complete;
2) propose a fusion strategy to boost pair comparisons by utilizing the ACR
results as initialization information; 3) develop a novel active batch sampling

networks to the changes in the data distribution during learning. This
phenomenon has long been considered a major obstacle for using learning agents

research assumes that task boundaries are known during training. However, only
a few works consider scenarios in which task boundaries are unknown or not well
defined -- task agnostic scenarios. The optimal Bayesian solution for this

Contributions: We aim to approximate the online Bayes update as accurately as
possible. To do so, we derive novel fixed-point equations for the online
variational Bayes optimization problem, for multivariate Gaussian parametric
distributions. By iterating the posterior through these fixed-point equations,
we obtain an algorithm (FOO-VB) for continual learning which can handle
non-stationary data distribution using a fixed architecture and without using
external memory (i.e. without access to previous data). We demonstrate that our
method (FOO-VB) outperforms existing methods in task agnostic scenarios. FOO-VB

glass plates, (ii) to assess the consequences of the dimensional reduction of
the problem and mesh density and refinement, and (iii) to validate for
quasi-static loading the time/temperature-dependent material properties we
derived recently for two commonly used polymer foils made of Polyvinyl Butyral
or Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate. As the nonlinear response prior to fracture, typical
of the widely used Bourdin-Francfort-Marigo model, can lead to a significant
overestimation of the response of thin plates under bending, the numerical
study investigates two additional phase-field fracture models providing the
linear elastic phase of the stress-strain diagram. The typical values of the
critical fracture energy and tensile strength of glass lead to a phase-field
length-scale parameter that is challenging to resolve in the numerical
simulations. So, we show how to determine the fracture energy concerning the
applied dimensional reduction and the value of the length-scale parameter
relative to the thickness of the plate. The comparison shows that the
phase-field models provide very good agreement with the measured stresses and
resistance of laminated glass, despite the fact that only one/two cracks
localised using the quasi-static analysis, whereas multiple cracks evolved
during the experiment. It has also been observed that the stiffness and
resistance of the partially fractured laminated glass can be well approximated
using a 2D plane-stress model with initially predefined cracks, which provides
a better estimation than the one-glass-layer limit.}

promising results. However, the approaches built on these estimations have some
potential weaknesses. First, they assume that the convergence of the student's
RL model implies less need for advice. This can be misleading in scenarios with
teacher absence early on where the student is likely to learn suboptimally by

between encountering states and having them to take effect in the RL model
updates in presence of the experience replay dynamics cause a feedback lag in
what the student actually needs advice for. We propose a student-initiated

inner products. This problem arises in many audio signal processing
applications which operate on a short-time Fourier transform magnitude or power
spectrogram, and discard the phase information. Recovering the missing phase
from the resulting modified spectrogram is indeed necessary in order to
synthesize time-domain signals. PR is commonly addressed by considering a
minimization problem involving a quadratic loss function. In this paper, we
adopt a different standpoint. Indeed, the quadratic loss does not properly
account for some perceptual properties of audio, and alternative discrepancy
measures such as beta-divergences have been preferred in many settings.
Therefore, we formulate PR as a new minimization problem involving Bregman
divergences. Since these divergences are not symmetric with respect to their
two input arguments in general, they lead to two different formulations of the
problem. To optimize the resulting objective, we derive two algorithms based on
accelerated gradient descent and alternating direction method of multipliers.
Experiments conducted on audio signal recovery from spectrograms that are
either exact or estimated from noisy observations highlight the potential of
our proposed methods for audio restoration. In particular, leveraging some of
these Bregman divergences induce better performance than the quadratic loss
when performing PR from spectrograms under very noisy conditions.

solution are studied by analyzing dislocation line roughness profiles obtained
from molecular dynamics simulations of Fe0.70Ni0.11 Cr0.19 over a range of
stresses and temperatures. These roughness profiles reveal the hallmark
features of a depinning transition. Namely, below a temperature-dependent
critical stress, the dislocation line exhibits roughness in two different
length scale regimes which are divided by a so-called correlation length. This
correlation length increases with applied stress and at the critical stress
(depinning transition or yield stress) formally goes to infinity. Above the
critical stress, the line roughness profile converges to that of a random noise
field. Motivated by these results, a physical model is developed based on the
notion of coherent line bowing over all length scales below the correlation
length. Above the correlation length, the solute field prohibits such coherent
line bow outs. Using this model, we identify potential gaps in existing
theories of solid solution strengthening and show that recent observations of
length-dependent dislocation mobilities can be rationalized.

machine learning algorithm that has traditionally been solved with heuristic
algorithms like Average-Linkage. Recently, Dasgupta reframed HC as a discrete
optimization problem by introducing a global cost function measuring the
quality of a given tree. In this work, we provide the first continuous
relaxation of Dasgupta's discrete optimization problem with provable quality
guarantees. The key idea of our method, HypHC, is showing a direct
correspondence from discrete trees to continuous representations (via the
hyperbolic embeddings of their leaf nodes) and back (via a decoding algorithm
that maps leaf embeddings to a dendrogram), allowing us to search the space of
discrete binary trees with continuous optimization. Building on analogies
between trees and hyperbolic space, we derive a continuous analogue for the
notion of lowest common ancestor, which leads to a continuous relaxation of
Dasgupta's discrete objective. We can show that after decoding, the global
minimizer of our continuous relaxation yields a discrete tree with a (1 +
epsilon)-factor approximation for Dasgupta's optimal tree, where epsilon can be
made arbitrarily small and controls optimization challenges. We experimentally
evaluate HypHC on a variety of HC benchmarks and find that even approximate
solutions found with gradient descent have superior clustering quality than
agglomerative heuristics or other gradient based algorithms. Finally, we
highlight the flexibility of HypHC using end-to-end training in a downstream
classification task.

many applications such as the analysis, diagnostics, and control of
high-intensity laser-matter interactions. However, straightforward use of
finite-difference methods can impose unacceptably high demands on computational
resources, owing to the necessity of resolving far-field and near-field zones

we present a procedure for fast computation of tight focusing by mapping a

limited initialization options (allows initialization of controls, but not of

problem with multiple knapsacks, heterogeneous constraints on which items can
be assigned to which knapsack, and rate-limiting constraints on the assignment
of items to knapsacks. This problem generalizes variations of the knapsack
problem and of the one-way trading problem that have previously been treated
separately, and additionally finds application to the real-time control of
electric vehicle (EV) charging. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves a
competitive ratio within an additive factor of one of the best achievable
competitive ratios for the general problem and matches or improves upon the
best-known competitive ratio for special cases in the knapsack and one-way
trading literatures. Moreover, our analysis provides a novel approach to online
algorithm design based on an instance-dependent primal-dual analysis that
connects the identification of worst-case instances to the design of
algorithms. Finally, we illustrate the proposed algorithm via trace-based
experiments of EV charging.

the desirability of dense urban settings at a turning point? Assessing cities'
long term trends remains challenging. The first part of this chapter describes
the short-run dynamics of the housing market in 2020. Evidence from prices and
price-to-rent ratios suggests expectations of resilience. Zip-level evidence
suggests a short-run trend towards suburbanization, and some impacts of urban
protests on house prices. The second part of the chapter analyzes the long-run
dynamics of urban growth between 1970 and 2010. It analyzes what, in such urban
growth, is explained by short-run shocks as opposed to fundamentals such as
education, industrial specialization, industrial diversification, urban
segregation, and housing supply elasticity. This chapter's original results as
well as a large established body of literature suggest that fundamentals are
the key drivers of growth. The chapter illustrates this finding with two case
studies: the New York City housing market after September 11, 2001; and the San
Francisco Bay Area in the aftermath of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Both
areas rebounded strongly after these shocks, suggesting the resilience of the
urban metropolis.

energy spectra scale as $\propto k_{\perp}^{-5/3}$ and $\propto

progressive balancing of the turbulence as the cascade proceeds to smaller

precisely, by defining a handicap metric that counts the number of unsafe

in the classical sequential probability ratio test, redefined here for
continuing tasks. Under standard assumptions on sufficient exploration, our
rule provably detects all unsafe machines in an (expected) finite number of

needed to secure the environment and the probability of discarding safe

specific auxiliary goal since it provides a safe environment to search for
(approximately) optimal policies. Simulations corroborate our theoretical
findings and further illustrate the aforementioned trade-offs.

of industrial quality control, materials science and medical imaging. The need
to acquire and process each scan in a short time naturally leads to trade-offs
between speed and reconstruction quality, creating a need for fast
reconstruction algorithms capable of creating accurate reconstructions from
limited data.
  In this paper we introduce the Neural Network Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (NN-FDK)
algorithm. This algorithm adds a machine learning component to the FDK
algorithm to improve its reconstruction accuracy while maintaining its
computational efficiency. Moreover, the NN-FDK algorithm is designed such that
it has low training data requirements and is fast to train. This ensures that
the proposed algorithm can be used to improve image quality in high throughput
CT scanning settings, where FDK is currently used to keep pace with the
acquisition speed using readily available computational resources.
  We compare the NN-FDK algorithm to two standard CT reconstruction algorithms
and to two popular deep neural networks trained to remove reconstruction
artifacts from the 2D slices of an FDK reconstruction. We show that the NN-FDK
reconstruction algorithm is substantially faster in computing a reconstruction
than all the tested alternative methods except for the standard FDK algorithm
and we show it can compute accurate CCB CT reconstructions in cases of high
noise, a low number of projection angles or large cone angles. Moreover, we
show that the training time of an NN-FDK network is orders of magnitude lower
than the considered deep neural networks, with only a slight reduction in
reconstruction accuracy.

we present a new family of algorithms for learning Fourier-sparse set

evaluations), under mild conditions on the Fourier coefficients, where $n$ is
the size of the ground set and $k$ the number of non-zero Fourier coefficients.
In contrast to other work that focused on the orthogonal Walsh-Hadamard

Fourier transforms that offer different notions of Fourier-sparsity. These
naturally arise when modeling, e.g., sets of items forming substitutes and

violation in the leptonic sector. We first quantify its global statistical
significance, by combining the results from relevant neutrino oscillation
experiments. As the hint is indirect, other new physics apart from three
massive neutrinos could be present, masking the results as direct leptonic CP
violation has not yet been conclusively observed. Thus, we move on to checking
the robustness of the hint against the framework in which the experimental data
is interpreted; in other words, its physical origin. To that purpose, we
confront with data the scenario that is less bounded by other experiments:
neutral current Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) among neutrinos and matter. In
the end, CP violation induced by neutrino masses and leptonic mixing is found
to be quite robust, due to the large amount of neutrino flavour transition data
collected along three decades.
  Nevertheless, the next generation LBL accelerator experiments are aimed at
precision measurements that could be more severely affected. Luckily, in the
last years the COHERENT experiment has provided independent constraints on NSI.
In the final chapter of the thesis, the data from the COHERENT experiment is
analysed and integrated into the global analyses from previous chapters. These
first results could be greatly improved by increasing the statistics of the
signal and/or by performing measurements with different nuclei sensitive to
different NSI models. For that, the European Spallation Source is an ideal
future facility, whose prospects for bounding NSI are also explored.
  In summary, this thesis takes a global approach to rigorously assess whether
cutting-edge leptonic flavour measurements are pointing towards a new strong
violation of a symmetry of Nature.

  Mode With the Fixed-time Convergence Guarantee","27 pages,16 figures",,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper study the parameter selection of predefined-time sliding mode and
try to design a general nonsingular predefined-time terminal sliding mode. 1).
On parameter selection: Some existing predefined-time sliding modes are
designed to focus on the reaching time and ignore the characterization of the
equilibrium point i.e. x_e= 0. In actual engineer, the system can only converge
to a small neighborhood near the equilibrium point because of the existence of
uncertainty i.e. x_e \to 0. The actual equilibrium point should be deduced by
taking the limit but not directly solve the equilibrium point. Hence, the
actual selection of exponential term is suggested to be not 1 to make system
convergence to the equilibrium point within predefined time. 2). On
singularity-avoidance: Based on the exponential feature of predefined-time
stability systems, a mathematic concept of switching sliding mode
\cite{su1994adaptive} is applied in the design of nonsingular predefined-time
terminal sliding mode. However, this class of sliding mode switching method
will cause a singular problem, which can be described as control input u \to
\infty if the system state x \to 0 and any-order time derivative of x is not 0.
Hence, a non-singular selection condition for each recursive sliding mode
surface is explored in this paper to realize the global finiteness of control
input. In addition, an unnecessary chattering of control input will also be
caused by the sliding mode switching frequency, and a novel switching condition
will be applied in the controller to reduce this chattering. Simulations will
be carried out to validate the effect of the novel nonsingular predefined-time
sliding mode control method to some extent.

February was located at RGO AR 13814 and its significant intensity is confirmed

magnetic storm was recorded worldwide. Comparative analyses on the contemporary
magnetograms show the storm peak intensity of minimum Dst* < -464 nT at 16 GMT,
comparable to the most and the second most extreme magnetic storms within the
standard Dst index since 1957. This storm triggered significant low-latitude
aurorae in the East Asian sector and their equatorward boundary has been
reconstructed as 38.5{\deg} in invariant latitude. This result agrees with
British magnetograms which indicate auroral oval moving above Abinger at

allows the emergence of a business based on the outsourcing of towers hosting
antennas and operated by the so-called Tower Companies (TowerCos). In this
paper, we develop a baseline business model for studying the potential
relationships between network operators and TowerCos. It turns out that the
gain in operational costs achieved when network operators outsource the
management of towers can be gracefully utilized to reduce prices so as to
attract more customers. The price drop has however to be carefully realized so
as not to break the market share between operators and to preserve competition.
To prove this claim, we adopt in a first step a centralized optimization
formulation. In a second step, we develop a game theoretic framework.

Radio observing efficiency can be improved by calibrating and reducing
the observations in total power mode rather than in frequency, beam, or
position-switching modes. Methods. We selected a sample of spectra obtained
from the Institut de Radio-Astronomie Millim\'etrique (IRAM) 30-m telescope and
the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to test the feasibility of the method. Given
that modern front-end amplifiers for the GBT and direct Local Oscillator
injection for the 30 m telescope provide smooth pass bands that are a few tens
of megahertz in width, the spectra from standard observations can be cleaned
(baseline removal) separately and then co-added directly when the lines are
narrow enough (a few km/s), instead of performing the traditional ON minus OFF
data reduction. This technique works for frequency-switched observations as
well as for position- and beam-switched observations when the ON and OFF data
are saved separately. Results. The method works best when the lines are narrow
enough and not too numerous so that a secure baseline removal can be achieved.
A signal-to-noise ratio improvement of a factor of sqrt(2) is found in most
cases, consistent with theoretical expectations. Conclusions. By keeping the
traditional observing mode, the fallback solution of the standard reduction
technique is still available in cases of suboptimal baseline behavior, sky
instability, or wide lines, and to confirm the line intensities. These
techniques of total-power-mode reduction can be applied to any radio telescope
with stable baselines as long as they record and deliver the ONs and OFFs
separately, as is the case for the GBT.

the probability of drawing a red ball (which represents an infection state) for
a given urn, not only depends on the ratio of red balls in that urn but also on
the ratio of red balls in the other urns in the network, hence accounting for
the effect of spatial contagion. The resulting network-wide contagion process
is a discrete-time finite-memory ($M$th order) Markov process, whose transition
probability matrix is determined. The stochastic properties of the network
contagion Markov process are analytically examined, and for homogeneous system
parameters, we characterize the limiting state of infection in each urn. For
the non-homogeneous case, given the complexity of the stochastic process, and
in the same spirit as the well-studied SIS models, we use a mean-field type
approximation to obtain a discrete-time dynamical system for the finite memory
interacting P\'{o}lya contagion network. Interestingly, for $M=1$, we obtain a
linear dynamical system which exactly represents the corresponding Markov
process. For $M>1$, we use mean-field approximation to obtain a nonlinear
dynamical system. Furthermore, noting that the latter dynamical system admits a
linear variant (realized by retaining its leading linear terms), we study the
asymptotic behavior of the linear systems for both memory modes and
characterize their equilibrium. Finally, we present simulation studies to
assess the quality of the approximation purveyed by the linear and non-linear
dynamical systems.

0.984 \pm 0.349$ for the temperature cross-correlation, interpreted as the
Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. The ISW amplitude is consistent with the
fiducial $\Lambda$CDM prediction, but lies significantly below the prediction
of the AvERA model of R\'acz et al. (2017), which has been proposed as an
alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration. Within $\Lambda$CDM, our low
amplitude for the lensing cross-correlation requires a reduction either in
fluctuation normalization or in matter density compared to the Planck results,
so that $\Omega_m^{0.78}\sigma_8=0.297\pm 0.009$. In combination with the total
amplitude of CMB lensing, this favours a shift mainly in density:
$\Omega_m=0.274\pm0.024$. We discuss the consistency of this figure with

training procedure. This counter-intuitive fact motivates us to investigate the
implementation details of tens of AT methods. Surprisingly, we find that the
basic settings (e.g., weight decay, training schedule, etc.) used in these
methods are highly inconsistent. In this work, we provide comprehensive
evaluations on CIFAR-10, focusing on the effects of mostly overlooked training
tricks and hyperparameters for adversarially trained models. Our empirical
observations suggest that adversarial robustness is much more sensitive to some
basic training settings than we thought. For example, a slightly different
value of weight decay can reduce the model robust accuracy by more than 7%,
which is probable to override the potential promotion induced by the proposed
methods. We conclude a baseline training setting and re-implement previous
defenses to achieve new state-of-the-art results. These facts also appeal to
more concerns on the overlooked confounders when benchmarking defenses.

whose global error converges faster than the truncation error. In this paper,
we elaborate the approach presented in arXiv:1711.07926 for the heat equation
with periodic boundary conditions. We generalize this methodology to design BFD
schemes for the heat equation with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions,
whose global error converges faster than the truncation error. Such schemes are
henceforth called Error Inhibiting Schemes. We provide an explicit error
analysis, including proofs of stability and convergence of the proposed
schemes. We illustrate our approach using several numerical examples, which
demonstrate the efficiency of our method in comparison to standard FD schemes.

expanding into a uniform background medium with density $n_H = 1.0$ cm$^{-3}$

ionisation (NEI) network (consisting of all the ions of H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg,
Si, S, Fe), frequency dependent radiation transfer (RT), thermal conduction,
and a simple dust evolution model, all intra-coupled to each other and to the
hydrodynamics. We assume spherical symmetry. Photo-ionisation, radiation
losses, photo-heating, charge-exchange heating/cooling and radiation pressure
are calculated on-the-fly depending on the local radiation field and ion
fractions. We find that the dynamics and energetics (but not the emission
spectra) of the SN remnants can be well modelled by collisional equilibrium
cooling curves even in the absence of non-equilibrium cooling and radiative
transport. We find that the effect of precursor ionising radiation at different
stages of SN remnant are dominated by rapid cooling of the shock and differ
from steady state shocks. The predicted column densities of different ions such
as N II, C IV and N V, can be higher by up to several orders of magnitude
compared to steady state shocks. We also present some high esolution emission
spectra that can be compared with the observed remnants to obtain important
information about the physical and chemical states of the remnant, as well as
constrain the background ISM.

their natal gaseous protoplanetary discs. It is unclear, however, how gas
accretion onto growing planets influences the shape and depth of their growing
gaps. We performed isothermal hydrodynamical simulations with the Fargo-2D1D
code, which assumes planets accreting gas within full discs that range from 0.1
to 260 AU. The gas accretion routine uses a sink cell approach, in which
different accretion rates are used to cope with the broad range of gas
accretion rates cited in the literature. We find that the planetary gas
accretion rate increases for larger disc aspect ratios and greater viscosities.
Our main results show that gas accretion has an important impact on the
gap-opening mass: we find that when the disc responds slowly to a change in
planetary mass (i.e., at low viscosity), the gap-opening mass scales with the
planetary accretion rate, with a higher gas accretion rate resulting in a
larger gap-opening mass. On the other hand, if the disc response time is short
(i.e., at high viscosity), then gas accretion helps the planet carve a deep
gap. As a consequence, higher planetary gas accretion rates result in smaller
gap-opening masses. Our results have important implications for the derivation
of planet masses from disc observations: depending on the planetary gas
accretion rate, the derived masses from ALMA observations might be off by up to
a factor of two. We discuss the consequences of the change in the gap-opening
mass on the evolution of planetary systems based on the example of the grand
tack scenario. Planetary gas accretion also impacts stellar gas accretion,
where the influence is minimal due to the presence of a gas-accreting planet.

km - has led to an increased demand for accurate environment characterisation
and aerodynamic force prediction. While the former requires knowledge of the
mechanisms that drive density variations in the thermosphere, the latter also
depends on the interactions between the gas-particles in the residual
atmosphere and the surfaces exposed to the flow. The determination of the
aerodynamic coefficients is hindered by the numerous uncertainties that
characterise the physical processes occurring at the exposed surfaces. Several
models have been produced over the last 60 years with the intent of combining
accuracy with relatively simple implementations. In this paper the most popular
models have been selected and reviewed using as discriminating factors
relevance with regards to orbital aerodynamics applications and theoretical
agreement with gas-beam experimental data. More sophisticated models were
neglected, since their increased accuracy is generally accompanied by a
substantial increase in computation times which is likely to be unsuitable for
most space engineering applications. For the sake of clarity, a distinction was
introduced between physical and scattering kernel theory based gas-surface
interaction models. The physical model category comprises the Hard Cube model,
the Soft Cube model and the Washboard model, while the scattering kernel family
consists of the Maxwell model, the Nocilla-Hurlbut-Sherman model and the
Cercignani-Lampis-Lord model. Limits and assets of each model have been
discussed with regards to the context of this paper. Wherever possible,
comments have been provided to help the reader to identify possible future
challenges for gas-surface interaction science with regards to orbital
aerodynamic applications.

metrics such as ROUGE fail to achieve this because they are limited to matching
tokens, either lexically or via embeddings. In this work, we propose a metric
to evaluate the content quality of a summary using question-answering (QA).
QA-based methods directly measure a summary's information overlap with a
reference, making them fundamentally different than text overlap metrics. We
demonstrate the experimental benefits of QA-based metrics through an analysis
of our proposed metric, QAEval. QAEval out-performs current state-of-the-art
metrics on most evaluations using benchmark datasets, while being competitive
on others due to limitations of state-of-the-art models. Through a careful
analysis of each component of QAEval, we identify its performance bottlenecks
and estimate that its potential upper-bound performance surpasses all other
automatic metrics, approaching that of the gold-standard Pyramid Method.

solve the fault inverse problem, where a planar fault in elastic half-space and
a slip on that fault have to be reconstructed from noisy surface displacement
measurements. With the parameter giving the plane containing the fault denoted
by m and the regularization parameter for the linear part of the inverse
problem denoted by C, both modeled as random variables, we derive a formula for
the posterior marginal of m. Modeling C as a random variable allows to sweep
through a wide range of possible values which was shown to be superior to
selecting a fixed value [11]. We prove that this posterior marginal of m is
convergent as the number of measurement points and the dimension of the space
for discretizing slips increase. Simply put, our proof only assumes that the
regularized discrete error functional for processing measurements relates to an
order 1 quadrature rule and that the union of the finite-dimensional spaces for
discretizing slips is dense. Our proof relies on trace class operator theory to
show that an adequate sequence of determinants is uniformly bounded. We also

There are many studies on human age estimation from biomedical images. However,
there is no research done on mammograms for age estimation, as far as we know.
The purpose of this study is to devise an AI-based model for estimating age
from mammogram images. Due to lack of public mammography data sets that have
the age attribute, we resort to using a web crawler to download thumbnail
mammographic images and their age fields from the public data set; the Digital
Database for Screening Mammography. The original images in this data set
unfortunately can only be retrieved by a software which is broken.
Subsequently, we extracted deep learning features from the collected data set,
by which we built a model using Random Forests regressor to estimate the age
automatically. The performance assessment was measured using the mean absolute
error values. The average error value out of 10 tests on random selection of
samples was around 8 years. In this paper, we show the merits of this approach
to fill up missing age values. We ran logistic and linear regression models on

all intersection sizes $|E\cap F|$ of distinct edges $E,F\in E(H)$. In their
seminal paper from 1973 which introduced the local lemma, Erd\H{o}s and
Lov\'asz asked: how large must the intersection spectrum of a $k$-uniform
$3$-chromatic intersecting hypergraph be? They showed that such a hypergraph
must have at least three intersection sizes, and conjectured that the size of
the intersection spectrum tends to infinity with $k$. Despite the problem being
reiterated several times over the years by Erd\H{o}s and other researchers, the
lower bound of three intersection sizes has remarkably withstood any
improvement until now. In this paper, we prove the Erd\H{o}s-Lov\'asz
conjecture in a strong form by showing that there are at least $k^{1/2-o(1)}$
intersection sizes. Our proof consists of a delicate interplay between Ramsey

QH edges at a PNJ, where either spin or valley symmetry or both are broken,
remain unexplored. In this work, we have carried out the measurements of
conductance together with shot noise, an ideal tool to unravel the dynamics, at
low temperature (~ 10mK) in a dual graphite gated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)

symmetry broken QH edges at the PNJ follow spin selective equilibration. The
shot noise results as a function of both p and n side filling factors reveal
the unique dependence of the scattering mechanism with filling factors.
Remarkably, the scattering is found to be fully tunable from incoherent to

marginal gains of around 0.7 dB on the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel. However, ALOHA-based massive Internet of Things systems, including
LoRa, often operate in the interference-limited regime. Therefore, in this
work, we examine the performance of the LoRa modulation with coherent detection
in the presence of interference from another LoRa user with the same spreading
factor. We derive rigorous symbol- and frame error rate expressions as well as
bounds and approximations for evaluating the error rates. The error rates
predicted by these approximations are compared against error rates found by
Monte Carlo simulations and shown to be very accurate. We also compare the
performance of LoRa with coherent and non-coherent receivers and we show that
the coherent detection of LoRa is significantly more beneficial in interference
scenarios than in the presence of only AWGN. For example, we show that coherent
detection leads to a 2.5 dB gain over the standard non-coherent detection for a
signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of 3 dB and up to a 10 dB gain for an SIR of
0 dB.

critical load and slenderness ratio indeed have an inverse nonlinear relation
between them -- identical to the classical Euler's critical load relation, and
closely resemble the relationship observed between the inter-tremor time

analysis, we conclude that the observed relation is the result of buckling of
the overriding continental plate. In addition to the above numerical analysis,
we analyze the surficial 3D spatio-temporal displacements of the overriding
plates in Cascadia and Alaska using 3-component GPS data. We find that these
deformations are consistent with the buckling of the overriding continental
crust. Based on these novel observations and guided by numerous existing
scientific observations and findings, we propose an Episodic Buckling and
Collapse model of subduction zones, wherein periodic geodetic changes and
tectonic-tremor activity, result from the episodic buckling of the overriding
continental crust and its rapid collapse on the subducting oceanic slab.
According to this model, geodetic measurements, previously inferred as slow

collapse of the overriding plate, while tremor swarms result from the striking
of the collapsing overriding plate on the subducting slab (as opposed to

model to compute a feedback policy that will drive the distribution of the
state of the system close to the goal distribution. In particular, we implement
a greedy covariance steering control policy that linearizes at each time step
the Gaussian process model around the latest predicted mean and covariance,
solves the linear covariance steering control problem, and applies only the
first control law. The state uncertainty under the latest feedback control
policy is then propagated using the unscented transform with the learned
Gaussian process predictive model and the algorithm proceeds to the next time
step. Numerical simulations illustrating the main ideas of this paper are also
presented.

planning in the discrete (task) space and the continuous (motion) space. In

navigation tasks have to be checked at the controller execution level.
Moreover, employing multiple robots offer enhanced performance capabilities

multi-robot setting incorporating mutual observations between the robots. The
framework is intended for motion planning under motion and sensing uncertainty,

depend on only microstructure and not the geometry, though beyond the long

Instead of one reproduction number there now are four parameters. These make it
possible to quantify the effect of the social distancing measures. There is a
simple stochastic model for epidemics in a two type population. Apart from the
size of the population of the vulnerable and the fit, and the initial number of
infected in the two classes, only the four reproduction parameters are needed
to run the two type Reed-Frost model. The program is simple and fast. On a pc
it takes less than five minutes to do a hundred thousand simulations of the
epidemic for a population of the size of the US. Epidemics are non-linear
processes. Results may be counterintuitive. The average number of vulnerable
persons infected by an infectious fit person is a crucial parameter of the
epidemic in the two type population. Intuitively this parameter should be
small. However simulations show that even if this parameter is small the death
toll may be higher than without shielding. Under certain conditions increasing
the value of the parameter may reduce the death toll. The article addresses
these blind spots in our intuition.

Adding nonlinearities to the system can also provide further avenues to

This work proposes to optimally design such a chain of resonators to mitigate
vibrations in a robust manner by accounting for various sources of design
uncertainties (e.g., nonlinear stiffness) and aleatory uncertainties (e.g.,
loading). The stochastic optimization algorithm is tailored to account for
discontinuities in the chain response due to the presence of nonlinearities. In
addition, a field formulation is used to define the properties of the
resonators along the chain and reduce the dimensionality of the optimization
problem. It is shown that the combination of the stochastic optimization

As a measure of robustness, we adopt the notion of the maximal safe radius for
a given input text, which is the minimum distance in the embedding space to the
decision boundary. Since computing the exact maximal safe radius is not
feasible in practice, we instead approximate it by computing a lower and upper
bound. For the upper bound computation, we employ Monte Carlo Tree Search in
conjunction with syntactic filtering to analyse the effect of single and
multiple word substitutions. The lower bound computation is achieved through an
adaptation of the linear bounding techniques implemented in tools CNN-Cert and
POPQORN, respectively for convolutional and recurrent network models. We
evaluate the methods on sentiment analysis and news classification models for
four datasets (IMDB, SST, AG News and NEWS) and a range of embeddings, and
provide an analysis of robustness trends. We also apply our framework to

produce a vacuum quasi-symmetric magnetic field with a target rotational

two-stage approach in which first a magnetic configuration with desirable
physics properties is found, and then coils to approximately realize this
magnetic configuration are designed. The proposed single-stage approach allows
us to find a compromise between confinement and engineering requirements, i.e.,
find easy-to-build coils with good confinement properties. Using forward and
adjoint sensitivities, we derive derivatives of the physical quantities in the
objective, which is constrained by a nonlinear periodic differential equation.
In two numerical examples, we compare different gradient-based descent
algorithms and find that incorporating approximate second-order derivative
information through a quasi-Newton method is crucial for convergence. We also
explore the optimization landscape in the neighborhood of a minimizer and find
many directions in which the objective is mostly flat, indicating ample freedom
to find simple and thus easy-to-build coils.

activities of petrophysicists searching for hydrocarbons. In this paper we
present work done, in collaboration with Rock Solid Images (RSI), using
supervised machine learning on a Cray XC30 to train models that streamline the
manual data interpretation process. With a general aim of decreasing the
petrophysical interpretation time down from over 7 days to 7 minutes, in this
paper we describe the use of mathematical models that have been trained using
raw well log data, for completing each of the four stages of a petrophysical
interpretation workflow, along with initial data cleaning. We explore how the
predictions from these models compare against the interpretations of human
petrophysicists, along with numerous options and techniques that were used to
optimise the prediction of our models. The power provided by modern
supercomputers such as Cray machines is crucial here, but some popular machine
learning framework are unable to take full advantage of modern HPC machines. As
such we will also explore the suitability of the machine learning tools we have
used, and describe steps we took to work round their limitations. The result of
this work is the ability, for the first time, to use machine learning for the
entire petrophysical workflow. Whilst there are numerous challenges,
limitations and caveats, we demonstrate that machine learning has an important
role to play in the processing of sub-surface data.

discovered coronavirus. The disease presents with symptoms such as shortness of
breath, fever, dry cough, and chronic fatigue, amongst others. Sometimes the
symptoms of the disease increase so much they lead to the death of the
patients. The disease may be asymptomatic in some patients in the early stages,
which can lead to increased transmission of the disease to others. Many studies
have tried to use medical imaging for early diagnosis of COVID-19. This study
attempts to review papers on automatic methods for medical image analysis and
diagnosis of COVID-19. For this purpose, PubMed, Google Scholar, arXiv and
medRxiv were searched to find related studies by the end of April 2020, and the
essential points of the collected studies were summarised. The contribution of
this study is four-fold: 1) to use as a tutorial of the field for both
clinicians and technologists, 2) to comprehensively review the characteristics
of COVID-19 as presented in medical images, 3) to examine automated artificial

Multiple ANN with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) or a gated recurrent unit (GRU)

clearly outperforms the MLP networks in terms of accuracy, whilst reaching up

closure terms for all considered filter functions. The GRU networks are also
shown to generalize well across different LES filters and resolutions. The

is because SBMLMs fail to harness the location information of the simulations.
To overcome these shortcomings, image based machine learning methods (IBMLMs)
are leveraged in this paper. The underlying theory of location information,
which supports the advantages of IBMLM, is qualitatively interpreted. Based on
this theory, a Res-SE-U-Net IBMLM surrogate model is developed and compared
with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a referencing SBMLM surrogate model. It

The sharp reflection dip is a hallmark feature underlying many envisioned
applications in precision sensing, secure communication and wave filtering.
However, a rigorous link between the underlying scattering anomaly and the
sensitivity of the system to a perturbation is still missing. Here, we develop
a theoretical description in complex scattering systems which quantitatively
explains the shape of the reflection dip. We further demonstrate that coherent
perfect absorption (CPA) is associated with a phase singularity and we relate
the sign of the diverging time delay to the mismatch between excitation rate

than relying on operation frequency and attenuation inside the system to be two
free parameters, we achieve ""on-demand"" CPA at an arbitrary frequency by
tweaking the chaotic cavity's scattering properties with programmable meta-atom
inclusions. Finally, we theoretically prove and experimentally verify the
optimal sensitivity of the CPA condition to minute perturbations of the system.

integrated miniaturized optical systems with unprecedented reductions in cost,
size, weight, and power. However, this goal has been consistently hindered by
the use of bulk free-space and fiber-optic components to process microcombs,
limiting form factors to the table-top. Here, we address this challenge by
introducing an integrated photonics interposer architecture to process
microcombs and replace discrete components. Taking microcomb-based optical
frequency synthesis in the telecom C-band around 1550 nm as our target
application, we develop an interposer architecture that collects, routes, and
interfaces octave-wide optical signals between photonic chiplets and
heterogeneously integrated devices that constitute the synthesizer. We have
implemented the octave spanning spectral filtering of a microcomb, central to
the interposer, in the popular silicon nitride photonic platform, and have
confirmed the requisite performance of the individual elements of the
interposer. Moreover, we show that the thick silicon nitride needed for bright
dissipative Kerr soliton generation can be integrated with the comparatively
thin silicon nitride interposer layer through octave-bandwidth adiabatic
evanescent coupling, indicating a path towards future system-level
consolidation. Our interposer architecture addresses the immediate need for
on-chip microcomb processing to successfully miniaturize microcomb systems. As
microcombs and integrated devices evolve, our approach can be readily adapted
to other metrology-grade applications based on optical atomic clocks and
high-precision navigation and spectroscopy.
