inevitably weaken the economy. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic underscores the
trade-off arising from public health and economic cost. An optimal lockdown
policy to resolve this trade-off is highly desired. Here we propose a
mathematical framework of pandemic control through an optimal stabilizing
non-uniform lockdown, where our goal is to reduce the economic activity as
little as possible while decreasing the number of infected individuals at a
prescribed rate. This framework allows us to efficiently compute the optimal
stabilizing lockdown policy for general epidemic spread models, including both
the classical SIS/SIR/SEIR models and a new model of COVID-19 transmissions. We
demonstrate the power of this framework by analyzing publicly available data of
inter-county travel frequencies to analyze a model of COVID-19 spread in the 62
counties of New York State. We find that an optimal stabilizing lockdown based
on epidemic status in April 2020 would have reduced economic activity more
stringently outside of New York City compared to within it, even though the
epidemic was much more prevalent in New York City at that point. Such a
counterintuitive result highlights the intricacies of pandemic control and
sheds light on future lockdown policy design.

(biological, physical, etc.) and social systems. Continuous and discrete
fractional calculus is the instrument to describe the behavior of systems with
the power-law memory. The existence of chaotic solutions is an intrinsic
property of nonlinear dynamics (regular and fractional). The behavior of
fractional systems can be very different from the behavior of the corresponding
systems with no memory. Finding periodic points is essential for understanding
regular and chaotic dynamics. Fractional systems do not have periodic points
except for fixed points. Instead, they have asymptotically periodic points
(sinks). There have been no reported results (formulae) that would allow
calculations of asymptotically periodic points of nonlinear fractional systems
so far. In this paper, we derive the equations that allow calculations of the
coordinates of the asymptotically periodic sinks.

different codes in the Python ecosystem, we perform simulations for
increasingly complex models in a shallow marine setting. We first verify the
computed fields with semi-analytical solutions for a simple layered model. Then
we validate the responses of a more complex block model by comparing results
obtained from each code. Finally we compare the responses of a real world model
with results from the industry. On the one hand, these validations show that
the open-source codes are able to compute comparable CSEM responses for
challenging, large-scale models. On the other hand, they show many general and
method-dependent problems that need to be faced for obtaining accurate results.
Our comparison includes finite-element and finite-volume codes using structured
rectilinear and octree meshes as well as unstructured tetrahedral meshes.
Accurate responses can be obtained independently of the chosen method and the
chosen mesh type. The runtime and memory requirements vary greatly based on the
choice of iterative or direct solvers. However, we have found that much more
time was spent on designing the mesh and setting up the simulations than
running the actual computation. The challenging task is, irrespective of the

technologies, the final fabricated parts can vary significantly from the
original CAD models, therefore raising issues regarding accuracy, surface
finish, robustness, mechanical properties, functional and geometrical
constraints. Various researchers have studied the correlation between AM
technologies and design rules.
  In this work we propose a novel approach to assessing the capability of a 3D
model to be printed successfully (a.k.a printability) on a specific AM machine.
This is utilized by taking into consideration the model mesh complexity and
certain part characteristics. A printability score is derived for a model in
reference to a specific 3D printing technology, expressing the probability of
obtaining a robust and accurate end result for 3D printing on a specific AM
machine. The printability score can be used either to determine which 3D
technology is more suitable for manufacturing a specific model or as a guide to
redesign the model to ensure printability. We verify this framework by
conducting 3D printing experiments for benchmark models which are printed on
three AM machines employing different technologies: Fused Deposition Modeling
(FDM), Binder Jetting (3DP), and Material Jetting (Polyjet).

an automorphism group of a of possible biplane ${\mathcal D}$ of order $14$
divides $2^7\cdot3^2\cdot5\cdot7\cdot11\cdot13$. In this paper we show that
such a biplane do not have an automorphism of order $11$ or $13$, and thereby
establish that $|Aut({\mathcal D})|$ divides $2^7\cdot3^2\cdot5\cdot7.$
Further, we study a possible action of an automorphism of order five or seven,
and some small groups of order divisible by five or seven, on a biplane with

Disease (AD) and are used in clinical trials to track the therapeutic efficacy
of disease-modifying treatments. However, longitudinal MRI change measures can
be confounded by non-biological factors, such as different degrees of head
motion and susceptibility artifact between pairs of MRI scans. We hypothesize
that deep learning methods applied directly to pairs of longitudinal MRI scans
can be trained to differentiate between biological changes and non-biological
factors better than conventional approaches based on deformable image
registration. To achieve this, we make a simplifying assumption that biological
factors are associated with time (i.e. the hippocampus shrinks overtime in the
aging population) whereas non-biological factors are independent of time. We
then formulate deep learning networks to infer the temporal order of
same-subject MRI scans input to the network in arbitrary order; as well as to
infer ratios between interscan intervals for two pairs of same-subject MRI
scans. In the test dataset, these networks perform better in tasks of temporal
ordering (89.3%) and interscan interval inference (86.1%) than a
state-of-the-art deformation-based morphometry method ALOHA (76.6% and 76.1%
respectively) (Das et al., 2012). Furthermore, we derive a disease progression
score from the network that is able to detect a group difference between 58
preclinical AD and 75 beta-amyloid-negative cognitively normal individuals
within one year, compared to two years for ALOHA. This suggests that deep
learning can be trained to differentiate MRI changes due to biological factors
(tissue loss) from changes due to non-biological factors, leading to novel
biomarkers that are more sensitive to longitudinal changes at the earliest

a particular road is. We implement a novel approach to predict the Safety Index
of a road-based on its TWL specificity by using a Graph Neural Network (GNN)

interlinking in a vast feature space. We employed a GNN to emulate the TWL
feature vectors as individual nodes which were interlinked vis-\`a-vis edges of
a graph. This model was verified to perform better than Logistic Regression,
simple Feed-Forward Neural Networks, and even Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)

and do not require the incorporation of gain, vacuum induces coherence between
two modes. Owing to this coherence, the linear response acquires a pole on the

sensing of very weak anhamonicities at low pumping rates. Higher drive powers
($\sim 0.1$ W), on the other hand, generate new domains of coherences. Our
results are applicable to a wide class of systems, and we specifically
illustrate the remarkable sensing capabilities in the context of a weakly

tapered fiber waveguide. A small change in the anharmonicity leads to a
substantial change in the induced spin current.

key to unraveling how the electronic properties of 2D HOIPs relate to their

first-principles calculations to characterize the Raman-active modes in four 2D
HOIPs: hexylammonium lead iodide [(HA)$_2$PbI$_4$, HA = C$_6$H$_{13}$NH$_3^+$],
hexylammonium lead bromide [(HA)$_2$PbBr$_4$], butylammonium lead iodide

strongest, and assign the major peaks observed in experiments as ammonium
bending vibrations. We employ a combination of density functional perturbation
theory based on the local density approximation and the frozen-phonon approach

experimental and calculated Raman spectra. Furthermore, by comparing the
vibrational spectra of isolated molecular cations with those near lead-halide

highest increases in CO (ppm), PM2.5, and PM10 concentrations ({\mu}g/m3) were
clustered around the west coastal fire-prone states, during the 15 August - 15
September period. The average CO concentration (ppm) was increased most
significantly in Oregon (1147.10), followed by Washington (812.76), and
California (13.17). Meanwhile, the concentration ({\mu}g/m3) in particulate

highest in Washington (45.83 and 88.47 for PM2.5 and PM10), followed by Oregon

road safety. Automatic adjustment of application rate in response to road,

  In the US, salt application rates are typically pre-set manually based on
roadway classification, cycle time, desired level of service (LOS), and
expected traffic, road, and weather conditions. The operators can temporarily
change the application rate manually based on their experience and
observations. Current spreader automation mostly involves adjusting discharge
rate in response to spreader speed, although pavement temperature sensors are
likely to be adopted in the future.

solving our improved master equations with a point source, we are able to
quantify the rate of orbital energy dissipation via electromagnetic and

apply our dissipative calculations to determine trajectories for intermediate

$O(\sqrt{\frac{n}{T}})$ in some cases. Experiments on various models and

predictors, such as neural networks, is generally intractable, making
approximate methods such as variational inference a promising alternative.
While most methods perform inference in the space of parameters, we explore the
benefits of carrying inference directly in the space of predictors. Relying on
a family of distributions given by a deep generative neural network, we present
two ways of carrying variational inference: one in \emph{parameter space}, one
in \emph{predictor space}. Importantly, the latter requires us to choose a

various perspectives the implications of working in the predictor space induced

quality of uncertainty estimation for data lying outside of the training

suggests the less good fit in the tropical, marine boundary layer is driven by
neural network difficulty emulating fast, stochastic signals in convection.
However, spectral analysis in the temporal domain indicates skillful emulation
of signals on diurnal to synoptic scales. A close look at the diurnal cycle
reveals correct emulation of land-sea contrasts and vertical structure in the
heating and moistening fields, but some distortion of precipitation.
Sensitivity tests targeting precipitation skill reveal complementary effects of
adding positive constraints vs. hyperparameter tuning, motivating the use of
both in the future. A first attempt to force an offline land model with DNN
emulated atmospheric fields produces reassuring results further supporting
neural network emulation viability in real-geography settings. Overall, the fit
skill is competitive with recent attempts by sophisticated Residual and

where the time evolution becomes complicated due to singularities produced by
the modular nonlinearity. We prove that the viscous shocks are asymptotically
stable under odd and general perturbations. For the odd perturbations, the
proof relies on the reduction of the modular Burgers equation to a linear
diffusion equation on a half-line. For the general perturbations, the proof is
developed by converting the time-evolution problem to a system of linear
equations coupled with a nonlinear equation for the interface position.
Exponential weights in space are imposed on the initial data of general
perturbations in order to gain the asymptotic decay of perturbations in time.
We give numerical illustrations of asymptotic stability of the viscous shocks

on the performance of orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation and
propose window designs to improve the OTFS channel estimation and data
detection performance. In particular, assuming ideal pulse shaping filters at
the transceiver, we derive the impacts of windowing on the effective channel
and its estimation performance in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, the total
average transmit power and the effective noise covariance matrix. When the
channel state information (CSI) is available at the transceiver, we analyze the
minimum squared error (MSE) of data detection and propose an optimal
transmitter window to minimize the detection MSE. The proposed optimal
transmitter window is interpreted as a mercury/water-filling power allocation
scheme, where the mercury is firstly filled before pouring water to
pre-equalize the TF domain channels. When the CSI is not available at the
transmitter but can be estimated at the receiver, we propose to apply a
Dolph-Chebyshev (DC) window at either the transmitter or the receiver, which
can effectively enhance the sparsity of the effective channel in the DD domain.
Thanks to the enhanced DD domain channel sparsity, the channel spread due to
the fractional Doppler is significantly reduced, which leads to a lower error
floor in both channel estimation and data detection compared with that of
rectangular window. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the obtained
analytical results and confirm the superiority of the proposed window designs
in improving the channel estimation and data detection performance over the
conventional rectangular window design.

progression patterns are shared among these regions within different time
periods. This intuition lead us to develop a new neural forecasting model,
called Attention Crossing Time Series (\textbf{ACTS}), that makes forecasts via
comparing patterns across time series obtained from multiple regions. The
attention mechanism originally developed for natural language processing can be

modulation over high-mobility channels is investigated. We start from the study
of conditional pairwise-error probability (PEP) of the OTFS scheme, based on
which its performance upper bound of the coded OTFS system is derived. Then, we
show that the coding improvement for OTFS systems depends on the squared
Euclidean distance among codeword pairs and the number of independent
resolvable paths of the channel. More importantly, we show that there exists a
fundamental trade-off between the coding gain and the diversity gain for OTFS
systems, i.e., the diversity gain of OTFS systems improves with the number of
resolvable paths, while the coding gain declines. Furthermore, based on our
analysis, the impact of channel coding parameters on the performance of the
coded OTFS systems is unveiled. The error performance of various coded OTFS
systems over high-mobility channels is then evaluated. Simulation results
demonstrate a significant performance improvement for OTFS modulation over the

associated cancers. To flexibly model the complexity of many cancer-mutation
associations, we present a new software tool called PanelPRO, a R package that

individuals at an increased risk of carrying cancer susceptibility gene

(increasing) with increasing $n_s$ at lower (higher) $T_e$, as found in MLG.
The energy relaxation time $\tau_e$ is also discussed as a function of $\theta$

evolutionary model of sequential strategies and tested our model with computer

evaluated through games of Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) with other agents
in the population, allowing co-evolution to occur. We expanded upon past works
by proposing a novel mechanism to mutate stochastic Moore machines that enables
a richer class of machines to be evolved. These machines were then subjected to
various selection mechanisms and the resulting evolved strategies were
analyzed. We found that cooperation can indeed emerge spontaneously in evolving

strategies. In addition, we found that the resulting populations converged to
evolutionarily stable states and were resilient towards mutation. In order to
test the generalizability of our proposed mutation mechanism and simulation

to economic slowdown and large reduction of fossil fuel CO2 emissions, but it
is unclear how much it would reduce atmospheric CO2 concentration, and whether
it can be observed. We estimated that a 7.9% reduction in emissions for 4
months would result in a 0.25 ppm decrease in the Northern Hemisphere CO2, an
increment that is within the capability of current CO2 analyzers, but is a few
times smaller than natural CO2 variabilities caused by weather and the
biosphere such as El Nino. We used a state-of-the-art atmospheric transport
model to simulate CO2, driven by a new daily fossil fuel emissions dataset and
hourly biospheric fluxes from a carbon cycle model forced with observed climate
variability. Our results show a 0.13 ppm decrease in atmospheric column CO2
anomaly averaged over 50S-50N for the period February-April 2020 relative to a
10-year climatology. A similar decrease was observed by the carbon satellite
GOSAT3. Using model sensitivity experiments, we further found that COVID, the
biosphere and weather contributed 54%, 23%, and 23% respectively. This
seemingly small change stands out as the largest sub-annual anomaly in the last
10 years. Measurements from global ground stations were analyzed. At city
scale, on-road CO2 enhancement measured in Beijing shows reduction of 20-30
ppm, consistent with drastically reduced traffic during the lockdown. The
ability of our current carbon monitoring systems in detecting the small and
short-lasting COVID signal on the background of fossil fuel CO2 accumulated

interactions underlying the emerging cognition and behavior of an individual.
FC is usually defined as the correlation or partial correlation between brain

of interactions. Many directed acyclic graph (DAG) based methods were applied
to study the directed interactions using functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) data but the performance was severely limited by the small sample size
and high dimensionality, hindering its applications. To overcome the obstacles,
we propose a score based joint directed acyclic graph model to estimate the
directed FC in fMRI data. Instead of using a combinatorial optimization
framework, the structure of DAG is characterized with an algebra equation and
further regularized with sparsity and group similarity terms. The simulation
results have demonstrated the improved accuracy of the proposed model in
detecting causality as compared to other existing methods. In our case-control
study of the MIND Clinical Imaging Consortium (MCIC) data, we have successfully
identified decreased functional integration, disrupted hub structures and

symbol-wise maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection algorithm for OTFS modulation,
which aims to extract the information of each transmitted symbol based on the
corresponding related received symbols. Furthermore, in order to reduce the
detection complexity, we propose a partitioning rule that separates the related
received symbols into two subsets for detecting each transmitted symbol,
according to the corresponding path gains. We then introduce a hybrid detection
algorithm to exploit the power discrepancy of each subset, where the MAP
detection is applied to the subset with larger channel gains, while the
parallel interference cancellation (PIC) detection is applied to the subset
with smaller channel gains. Simulation results show that the proposed
algorithms can not only approach the performance of the near-optimal
symbol-wise MAP algorithms, but also offer a substantial performance gain
compared with existing algorithms.

""knowledge unit"" and ""knowmetrics"" for measuring knowledge. However, the
definition of ""computable knowledge object"" remains controversial so far in
different fields. For example, it is defined as 1) quantitative scientific
concept in natural science and engineering, 2) knowledge point in the field of
education research, and 3) semantic predications, i.e.,
Subject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triples in biomedical fields. The Semantic
MEDLINE Database (SemMedDB), a high-quality public repository of SPO triples
extracted from medical literature, provides a basic data infrastructure for
measuring medical knowledge. In general, the study of extracting SPO triples as
computable knowledge unit from unstructured scientific text has been
overwhelmingly focusing on scientific knowledge per se. Since the SPO triples
would be possibly extracted from hypothetical, speculative statements or even
conflicting and contradictory assertions, the knowledge status (i.e., the
uncertainty), which serves as an integral and critical part of scientific
knowledge has been largely overlooked. This article aims to put forward a
framework for Medical Knowmetrics using the SPO triples as the knowledge unit
and the uncertainty as the knowledge context. The lung cancer publications
dataset is used to validate the proposed framework. The uncertainty of medical
knowledge and how its status evolves over time indirectly reflect the strength
of competing knowledge claims, and the probability of certainty for a given SPO
triple. We try to discuss the new insights using the uncertainty-centric
approaches to detect research fronts, and identify knowledge claims with high
certainty level, in order to improve the efficacy of knowledge-driven decision

converge resiliently towards the global minimum.Further, aggregation with the

and displacement irradiations is usually evaluated by the sum of separated
ionization and displacement damages. However, recent experiments show clear
difference between the practical and summed damages, indicating significant
irradiation synergistic effects (ISEs). Understanding the behaviors and
mechanisms of ISEs is essential to predict the practical damages. In this work,
we first make a brief review on the state of the art, critically emphasizing on
the difficulty encountered in previous models to understand the dose rate
dependence of the ISEs. We then introduce in detail our models explaining this
basic phenomenon, which can be described as follows. Firstly, we show our
experimental works on PNP and NPN transistors. A variable neutron fluence and
$\gamma$-ray dose setup is adopted. Fluence-dependent `tick'-like and sublinear
dose profiles are observed for PNP and NPN transistors, respectively. Secondly,
we describe our theoretical investigations on the positive ISE in NPN
transistors. We propose an atomistic model of transformation and annihilation
of $\rm V_2$ displacement defects in p-type silicon under ionization
irradiation, which is totally different from the traditional picture of Coulomb
interaction of oxide trapped charges in silica on charge carriers in irradiated
silicon. The predicted novel dose and fluence dependences are fully verified by
the experimental data. Thirdly, the mechanism of the observed negative ISE in
PNP transistors is investigated in a similar way as in the NPN transistor case.
The difference is that in n-type silicon, VO displacement defects also undergo
an ionization-induced transformation and annihilation process. Our results show
that, the evolution of displacement defects due to carrier-enhanced defect
diffusion and reaction is the dominating mechanism of the ISEs.

Variations (TTV's), the shape of the transits contains additional information
on variations in the geometry of the orbit. This study presents an analytic
approach to light-curve fitting: dynamical variations in the orbital elements
are transformed to a light-curve using an analytic function with a restricted
set of fitting parameters. Our method requires no N-body integration, resulting
in a smaller number of degrees of freedom and a faster calculation. The
approach described here is for the case of secular perturbations. By assuming
that the orbital motion is dominated by nodal and apsidal precessions, analytic
expressions for the light-curve transit parameters are derived as a function of
the orbital variations. Detecting and characterizing such dynamical scenarios
provides information regarding the possible existence of non-transiting
companions, or the non-spherical mass distribution of the host star. The
variations may imply forces out of the orbital plane, and thus probe mutual
inclinations among components of the system. The derived models successfully
reproduce the vanishing transit signals of KOI 120.01, and suggest a possible

detect interesting effects in financial volatility overlooked by the existing

(e.g., YOLO and Fast R-CNN) are vulnerable to adversarial evasion attacks. Most
of the existing real-world adversarial attacks against object detectors use an
adversarial patch which is attached to the target object (e.g., a carefully
crafted sticker placed on a stop sign). This method may not be robust to
changes in the camera's location relative to the target object; in addition, it
may not work well when applied to nonplanar objects such as cars. In this
study, we present an innovative attack method against object detectors applied
in a real-world setup that addresses some of the limitations of existing
attacks. Our method uses dynamic adversarial patches which are placed at
multiple predetermined locations on a target object. An adversarial learning
algorithm is applied in order to generate the patches used. The dynamic attack
is implemented by switching between optimized patches dynamically, according to
the camera's position (i.e., the object detection system's position). In order
to demonstrate our attack in a real-world setup, we implemented the patches by
attaching flat screens to the target object; the screens are used to present
the patches and switch between them, depending on the current camera location.
Thus, the attack is dynamic and adjusts itself to the situation to achieve
optimal results. We evaluated our dynamic patch approach by attacking the
YOLOv2 object detector with a car as the target object and succeeded in
misleading it in up to 90% of the video frames when filming the car from a wide
viewing angle range. We improved the attack by generating patches that consider
the semantic distance between the target object and its classification. We also
examined the attack's transferability among different car models and were able
to mislead the detector 71% of the time.

construct desired mass matrices for neutrino mass. Five-zero textures are
imposed in the final $4\times4$ active-sterile mass matrix, which significantly
reduces free parameter in the model. Three right-handed neutrinos were
considered, two of them have nearly degenerate masses which help us to achieve
baryogenesis via resonant leptogenesis. A singlet fermion (sterile neutrino)
with mass $\sim\mathcal{O}$(eV) is also considered, and we are able to put
bounds on active-sterile mixing parameters via neutrino oscillation data.
Resonant enhancement of lepton asymmetry is studied at TeV scale, where we
discuss a few aspects of baryogenesis considering the flavour effects.
Possibility of improvement in effective mass from $0\nu\beta\beta$ in the
presence of a single generation of sterile neutrino flavour is also studied
within the fermion sector. In the scalar sector, the imaginary component of the
complex singlet scalar is behaving as a potential dark matter candidate and
simultaneously the real part of the complex scalar is associated with the
fermion sector for sterile mass generation. A broad region of dark matter mass
is analyzed from various annihilation processes, and the VEV of the complex
scalar plays a pivotal role to achieve the observed relic density at the right
ballpark.

properties of these compounds were revealed. It has been demonstrated that, in
all AFM kagome cuprates, including herbertsmithite, there exists the
competition between the exchange interaction and the antisymmetric anisotropic
exchange one (the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction), as magnetic ions are not
linked to the center of inversion in the kagome lattice. This competition is
strengthened in all the kagome AFM, except herbertsmithite, by one more type of
the anisotropy (duality) of the third in length J3 magnetic couplings (strong
J3(J12) next-to-nearest-neighbor couplings in linear chains along the triangle
edges and very weak FM or AFM J3(Jd) couplings along the hexagon diagonals).
The above couplings are crystallographically identical, but are divided to two
types of different in strength magnetic interactions. The existence of duality
of J3 couplings originated from the structure of the kagome lattice itself.
Only combined contributions of dual J3 couplings with anisotropic DM
interactions are capable to suppress frustration of kagome AFM. It has been
demonstrated that the possibility of elimination of such a duality in
herbertsmithite, which made it a spin liquid, constitutes a rare lucky event in
the kagome system. Three crystal chemistry criteria of the existence of spin
liquids on the kagome lattice have been identified: first, the presence of
frustrated kagome lattices with strong dominant antiferromagnetic
nearest-neighbor J1 couplings competing only with each other in small

steady $\gamma$-ray flux from HESS J1826$-$130, which appears extended with a
half-width of 0.21$^{\circ}$ $\pm$ 0.02$^{\circ}_{\text{stat}}$ $\pm$
0.05$^{\circ}_{\text{sys}}$. The source spectrum is best fit with either a
power-law function with a spectral index $\Gamma$ = 1.78 $\pm$
0.10$_{\text{stat}}$ $\pm$ 0.20$_{\text{sys}}$ and an exponential cut-off at
15.2$^{+5.5}_{-3.2}$ TeV, or a broken power-law with $\Gamma_{1}$ = 1.96 $\pm$

$E_{\rm{br}}$ = 11.2 $\pm$ 2.7 TeV, respectively. The VHE flux from HESS
J1826$-$130 is contaminated by the extended emission of the bright, nearby
pulsar wind nebula (PWN), HESS J1825$-$137, particularly at the low end of the
energy spectrum. Leptonic scenarios for the origin of HESS J1826$-$130 VHE
emission related to PSR J1826$-$1256 are confronted by our spectral and
morphological analysis. In a hadronic framework, taking into account the
properties of dense gas regions surrounding HESS J1826$-$130, the source
spectrum would imply an astrophysical object capable of accelerating the parent
particle population up to $\gtrsim$200 TeV. Our results are also discussed in a
multiwavelength context, accounting for both the presence of nearby supernova
remnants (SNRs), molecular clouds, and counterparts detected in radio, X-rays,

data with laborious per-pixel annotation. In this paper, we propose a
scribble-based weakly supervised road surface extraction method named
ScRoadExtractor, which learns from easily accessible scribbles such as
centerlines instead of densely annotated road surface ground-truths. To
propagate semantic information from sparse scribbles to unlabeled pixels, we
introduce a road label propagation algorithm which considers both the
buffer-based properties of road networks and the color and spatial information
of super-pixels. The proposal masks generated from the road label propagation
algorithm are utilized to train a dual-branch encoder-decoder network we
designed, which consists of a semantic segmentation branch and an auxiliary
boundary detection branch. We perform experiments on three diverse road
datasets that are comprised of highresolution remote sensing satellite and
aerial images across the world. The results demonstrate that ScRoadExtractor
exceed the classic scribble-supervised segmentation method by 20% for the
intersection over union (IoU) indicator and outperform the state-of-the-art
scribble-based weakly supervised methods at least 4%.

batteries, while such reorganization partially stabilizes oxygen redox, it also
gives rise to substantial hysteresis. In this work, we investigate oxygen redox
in layered Na2-XMn3O7, a positive electrode material with ordered Mn vacancies.
We show that coulombic interactions between oxidized oxide-anions and the
interlayer Na vacancies can disfavor rehybridization and stabilize hole
polarons on oxygen at 4.2 V vs. Na/Na+. These coulombic interactions provide
thermodynamic energy saving as large as O-O covalent bonding and enable ~ 40 mV

smaller or equal to the number of transmit antennas. In particular, we derive
the optimal rate-memory trade-off under the assumption of uncoded placement and
characterize the same trade-off within a factor of 2.01 for general placement.

is an important problem in directional sensor networks (DSNs). This problem is
challenging as the targets usually move randomly but the coverage range of
sensors is limited in angle and distance. Thus, it is required to coordinate
sensors to get ideal target coverage with low power consumption, e.g. no
missing targets or reducing redundant coverage. To realize this, we propose a
Hierarchical Target-oriented Multi-Agent Coordination (HiT-MAC), which
decomposes the target coverage problem into two-level tasks: targets assignment
by a coordinator and tracking assigned targets by executors. Specifically, the
coordinator periodically monitors the environment globally and allocates
targets to each executor. In turn, the executor only needs to track its
assigned targets. To effectively learn the HiT-MAC by reinforcement learning,
we further introduce a bunch of practical methods, including a self-attention
module, marginal contribution approximation for the coordinator,
goal-conditional observation filter for the executor, etc. Empirical results
demonstrate the advantage of HiT-MAC in coverage rate, learning efficiency,and
scalability, comparing to baselines. We also conduct an ablative analysis on
the effectiveness of the introduced components in the framework.

provide four simple HT-AA baseline algorithms and eight benchmarks changing
various aspects of ML algorithms, their hyperparameter search spaces, and the
neural architectures used. The best baseline, on average and depending on the
budgets for the old and new HPO, reaches a given performance 1.2--2.6x faster
than a prominent HPO algorithm without transfer. As HPO is a crucial step in ML
development but requires extensive computational resources, this speedup would
lead to faster development cycles, lower costs, and reduced environmental
impacts. To make these benefits available to ML developers off-the-shelf and to
facilitate future research on HT-AA, we provide python packages for our
baselines and benchmarks.

the Plackett-Luce (PL) model, a probability distribution on rankings, which we
combine with a state-of-the-art neural network architecture and a simple
sampling strategy to reduce training complexity. Moreover, taking advantage of
the representation of PL as a random utility model, the proposed predictor
offers a natural way to recover (shift-invariant) metric depth information from

our approach compared to existing ranking and regression methods.

Although flow records are collected at each router, using available traffic
capture utilities, querying the resulting datasets from hundreds of routers
across sites and over time, remains a significant challenge due to the sheer
traffic volume and distributed nature of flow records.
  In this paper, we investigate how to improve the response time for a priori
unknown network-wide queries. We present Flowyager, a system that is built on
top of existing traffic capture utilities. Flowyager generates and analyzes
tree data structures, that we call Flowtrees, which are succinct summaries of
the raw flow data available by capture utilities. Flowtrees are self-adjusted
data structures that drastically reduce space and transfer requirements, by 75%
to 95%, compared to raw flow records. Flowyager manages the storage and
transfers of Flowtrees, supports Flowtree operators, and provides a structured
query language for answering flow queries across sites and time periods. By
deploying a Flowyager prototype at both a large Internet Exchange Point and a
Tier-1 Internet Service Provider, we showcase its capabilities for networks
with hundreds of router interfaces. Our results show that the query response
time can be reduced by an order of magnitude when compared with alternative
data analytics platforms. Thus, Flowyager enables interactive network-wide
queries and offers unprecedented drill-down capabilities to, e.g., identify
DDoS culprits, pinpoint the involved sites, and determine the length of the

  FAPE's representation coherently integrates flexible timelines with
hierarchical refinement methods that can provide efficient control knowledge. A
novel reachability analysis technique is proposed and used to develop causal
networks to constrain the search space. It is employed for the design of
informed heuristics, inference methods and efficient search strategies.
Experimental results on common benchmarks in the field permit to assess the
components and search strategies of FAPE, and to compare it to IPC planners.
The results show the proposed approach to be competitive with less expressive
planners and often superior when hierarchical control knowledge is provided.
FAPE, a freely available system, provides other features, not covered here,

Due to the infinite energy of the system, the (random) energy functional has to
be renormalized. Using the topology of $\Gamma$-convergence, we give a sense to
the law of the renormalized functional that is independent of the way white
noise is approximated. More precisely, this universality holds in the class of
(not necessarily Gaussian) approximations to white noise satisfying the
spectral gap inequality, which allows us to obtain sharp stochastic estimates.
As a corollary, we obtain the existence of minimizers with optimal regularity.

have various tunable physical and chemical properties. Their diverse
prospective applications in electronics and energy storage devices have
triggered great interests in science and technology. MXenes can be
functionalized by different surface terminations. Some O and F functionalized
MXenes monolayers have been predicted to be topological insulators (TIs).
However, the reported OH functionalized MXenes TIs are very few and their
electronic structures need to be investigated in more detail. It has been
revealed that the work functions of MXenes are reduced significantly by OH
termination and the image potential (IP) states move close to the Fermi level.
The wave functions of these IP states are spatially extensive outside the
surfaces. By stacking the OH-functionalized MXenes, the energies of the IP
states can be modulated by the interlayer distances of multilayers, because the
overlap and hybridization of the wave functions between the neighboring layers
are significant. Therefore, these stacking layers are interacted and coupled
with IP states. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate
that the stacking of two-dimensional topologically trivial OH-functionalized
MXenes, such as V$_2$HfC$_2$(OH)$_2$, possibly gives rise to the topologically
nontrivial energy bands. In other words, the topological properties of
V$_2$HfC$_2$(OH)$_2$ multilayers can be modulated by its interlayer distance.
An energy band inversion involving IP states is proposed. We expect that these
results can advance the future application of MXenes or other low work function
multilayer materials as controllable TI devices.

solar wind flows viewed by coronagraphs or heliospheric imagers from rapidly
varying viewpoints.
  Methods: We constructed maps of intensity versus time and elongation (J-maps)
from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) Wide-field Imager (WISPR) observations during the
fourth encounter of PSP. From the J-map, we built an intensity on
impact-radius-on-Thomson-surface map (R-map). Finally, we constructed a
latitudinal intensity versus time map (Lat-map). Our methodology satisfactorily
addresses the challenges associated with the construction of such maps from
data taken from rapidly varying viewpoint observations.
  Results: Our WISPR J-map exhibits several tracks, corresponding to transient
solar wind flows ranging from a coronal mass ejection (CME) down to streamer
blobs. The latter occurrence rate is about 4-5 per day, which is similar to the
occurrence rate in a J-map made from $\sim1$ AU data obtained with the
Heliospheric Imager-1 (HI-1) on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory Ahead spacecraft (STEREO-A). STEREO-A was radially aligned with PSP
during the study period. The WISPR J-map tracks correspond to angular speeds of
$2.28 \pm 0.7$$^{\circ}$/hour ($2.49 \pm 0.95$$^{\circ}$/hour), for linear
(quadratic) time-elongation fittings, and radial speeds of about 150-300 km
s$^{-1}$. The analysis of the Lat-map reveals a bifurcating streamer, which
implies that PSP was flying through a slightly folded streamer during
perihelion.
  Conclusions: We developed a framework to systematically capture and
characterize transient solar wind flows from space platforms with rapidly
varying vantage points. The methodology can be applied to PSP WISPR
observations as well as to upcoming observations from instruments on board the
Solar Orbiter mission.

self-generated stress. In the case of a solid, such motion can lead to shape
transformations. The stress-generating components can be anisotropic endowing
the material with mesoscopic orientational order. It is currently unknown how
the specific postions and orientations of these active constituents influence
morphological changes. We study theoretically the effects of imposing
topological point defects in the arrangements of the stress-generating
components on the morphology of elastic active nematic shells. We show that
topological defects of charge +1 are uniquely capable of increasing, reducing
or maintaining the intrinsic curvature of the shell. These changes depend on
the nature of the active stress and the phase angle of the defect. We apply our
theory to experiments conducted on contracting actomyosin sheets. By combining
defects of different charges, we can generate shells with arbitrary complexity.
We confirm this flexibility by reproducing the shape of the freshwater polyp
Hydra, in which topological defects have been associated with morphological
features of the animal. In addition to understanding morphogenetic processes,
these principles can be applied to the design of programmable active mechanical
metamaterials that form the basis of autonomous soft robots.

state in a one-dimensional system. We consider a chain inspired from the
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, but with a finite-frequency edge state and the
dynamics governed by second-order differential equations. We introduce a cubic
onsite-nonlinearity and study this nonlinear effect on the edge state's
frequency and linear stability. Nonlinear continuation reveals that the edge
state loses its typical shape enforced by the chiral symmetry and becomes
generally unstable due to various types of instabilities that we analyze using
a combination of spectral stability and Krein signature analysis. This results
in an initially-excited nonlinear-edge state shedding its energy into the bulk
over a long time. However, the stability trends differ both qualitatively and
quantitatively when softening and stiffening types of nonlinearity are
considered. In the latter, we find a frequency regime where nonlinear edge
states can be linearly stable. This enables high-amplitude edge states to
remain spatially localized without shedding their energy, a feature that we
have confirmed via long-time dynamical simulations. Finally, we examine the
robustness of frequency and stability of nonlinear edge states against
disorder, and find that those are more robust under a chiral disorder compared
to a non-chiral disorder. Moreover, the frequency-regime where high-amplitude
edge states were found to be linearly stable remains intact in the presence of
small amount of disorder of both types.

non-trivial in the one-pass streaming model. In contrast to previous graph
coloring problems in streaming that try to find an assignment of colors to
vertices, our main work is on estimating the number of conflicting or
monochromatic edges given a coloring function that is streaming along with the
graph; we call the problem {\sc Conflict-Est}. The coloring function on a
vertex can be read or accessed only when the vertex is revealed in the stream.
If we need the color on a vertex that has streamed past, then that color, along
with its vertex, has to be stored explicitly. We provide algorithms for a graph
that is streaming in different variants of the one-pass vertex arrival
streaming model, viz. the {\sc Vertex Arrival} ({\sc VA}), {Vertex Arrival With
Degree Oracle} ({\sc VAdeg}), {\sc Vertex Arrival in Random Order} ({\sc
VArand}) models, with special focus on the random order model. We also provide
matching lower bounds for most of the cases. The mainstay of our work is in
showing that the properties of a random order stream can be exploited to design
streaming algorithms for estimating the number of conflicting edges. We have
also obtained a lower bound, though not matching the upper bound, for the
random order model. Among all the three models vis-a-vis this problem, we can
show a clear separation of power in favor of the {\sc VArand} model.

machine learning tools, namely genetic algorithm with a gradient descent-like
minimization. Electromagnetic fields around a charged beam carry information
about its transverse profile. The electrodes of a stripline-type beam position
monitor (with eight probes in this study) can pick up that information for
visualization of the beam profile. We use a genetic algorithm to transform an
arbitrary Gaussian beam in such a way that it eventually reconstructs the
transverse position and the shape of the original beam. The algorithm requires
a signal that is picked up by the stripline electrodes, and a (precise or
approximate) knowledge of the beam size. It can visualize the profile of fairly
distorted beams as well.

was performed via the optical frequency comb with a supercontinuum fiber laser
generator. The transformation was conducted without loss of initial stability
and accuracy characteristics of the signal.

canonical foliation whose leaves are hypersurfaces with mean curvature vector
field proportional to the Lee vector field. The geodesibility of the leaves is
also characterized, and their minimality coincides with the incompressibility
of the Lee vector field along the leaves.

  Point-of-Care Monitoring of Ocular and Cardiovascular Complications Related
  to Diabetes","25 Pages, 12 Figures",,,,"physics.med-ph cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Among the most impactful diabetic complications are diabetic retinopathy, the
leading cause of blindness among working class adults, and cardiovascular
disease, the leading cause of death worldwide. This study describes the
development of improved machine learning based screening of these conditions.
First, a random forest model was developed by retrospectively analyzing the
influence of various risk factors (obtained quickly and non-invasively) on
cardiovascular risk. Next, a deep-learning model was developed for prediction
of diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images by a modified and re-trained
InceptionV3 image classification model. The input was simplified by
automatically segmenting the blood vessels in the retinal image. The technique
of transfer learning enables the model to capitalize on existing infrastructure
on the target device, meaning more versatile deployment, especially helpful in
low-resource settings. The models were integrated into a smartphone-based
device, combined with an inexpensive 3D-printed retinal imaging attachment.
Accuracy scores, as well as the receiver operating characteristic curve, the
learning curve, and other gauges, were promising. This test is much cheaper and
faster, enabling continuous monitoring for two damaging complications of
diabetes. It has the potential to replace the manual methods of diagnosing both
diabetic retinopathy and cardiovascular risk, which are time consuming and
costly processes only done by medical professionals away from the point of
care, and to prevent irreversible blindness and heart-related complications
through faster, cheaper, and safer monitoring of diabetic complications. As
well, tracking of cardiovascular and ocular complications of diabetes can
enable improved detection of other diabetic complications, leading to earlier
and more efficient treatment on a global scale.

variable parameter that can be changed by either electrostatic or magnetostatic
gating. A historical review of plasmonic graphene resonators is presented in
this paper, which can give physical insight to the researchers to be
familiarized with four types of graphene-based resonators: 1-Ring resonators,
2- planar, 3- Fabry-Perot, and 4-other resonators which are not categorized in
any of the other three groups.
