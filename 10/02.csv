to a class of stochastic differential equations driven by additive noise, under
a one-sided Lipschitz continuity condition. The setting encompasses drift
nonlinearities with polynomial growth. First, we prove that moment bounds for
the numerical scheme hold, with at most polynomial dependence with respect to
the time horizon. Second, we apply this result to obtain error estimates, in
the weak sense, in terms of the time-step size and of the time horizon, to
quantify the error to approximate averages with respect to the invariant
distribution of the continuous-time process. We justify the efficiency of using
the explicit tamed Euler scheme to approximate the invariant distribution,
since the computational cost does not suffer from the at most polynomial growth
of the moment bounds. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result in
the literature concerning the approximation of the invariant distribution for
SDEs with non-globally Lipschitz coefficients using an explicit tamed scheme.

Conveniently, our characterisation protocol can be performed with a coherent

his fundamental equations alleviated much of the skepticism surrounding pattern
formation. Though Turing model is a simplification and an idealization, it is
one of the best-known theoretical models to explain patterns as a reminiscent
of those observed in nature. Over the years, concerted efforts have been made
to align theoretical models to explain patterns in real systems. The apparent
difficulty in identifying the specific dynamics of the RD system makes the
problem particularly challenging. Interestingly, we observe Turing-like
patterns in a system of neurons with adversarial interaction. In this study, we
establish the involvement of Turing instability to create such patterns. By
theoretical and empirical studies, we present a pseudo-reaction-diffusion model
to explain the mechanism that may underlie these phenomena. While supervised
learning attains homogeneous equilibrium, this paper suggests that the
introduction of an adversary helps break this homogeneity to create
non-homogeneous patterns at equilibrium. Further, we prove that randomly
initialized gradient descent with over-parameterization can converge
exponentially fast to an $\epsilon$-stationary point even under adversarial
interaction. In addition, different from sole supervision, we show that the
solutions obtained under adversarial interaction are not limited to a tiny

The key ingredient is a theoretical justification supported by empirical

The intrinsic flux variability of S2 is at the level of 2 - 3%. Based on the
dust-extinction model, the upper limit on the number density at the S2 periapse

are consistent with a wide variety of media from hot accretion flows to
potentially colder and denser media comparable in properties to broad-line

acquired cognitive impairments such as dementia. Although there is no cure for
dementia, a timely diagnosis helps in obtaining necessary support and
appropriate medication. Researchers are working urgently to develop effective
technological tools that can help doctors undertake early identification of
cognitive disorder. In particular, screening for dementia in ageing Deaf
signers of British Sign Language (BSL) poses additional challenges as the
diagnostic process is bound up with conditions such as quality and availability
of interpreters, as well as appropriate questionnaires and cognitive tests. On
the other hand, deep learning based approaches for image and video analysis and
understanding are promising, particularly the adoption of Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN), which require large amounts of training data. In this paper,
however, we demonstrate novelty in the following way: a) a multi-modal machine
learning based automatic recognition toolkit for early stages of dementia among
BSL users in that features from several parts of the body contributing to the
sign envelope, e.g., hand-arm movements and facial expressions, are combined,
b) universality in that it is possible to apply our technique to users of any
sign language, since it is language independent, c) given the trade-off between
complexity and accuracy of machine learning (ML) prediction models as well as
the limited amount of training and testing data being available, we show that
our approach is not over-fitted and has the potential to scale up.

code that corrects a single amplitude damping error, and we analyze this code's

operate in uncertain environments, but the tools for formally analyzing how
this uncertainty propagates to NN outputs are not yet commonplace. Computing
tight bounds on NN output sets (given an input set) provides a measure of
confidence associated with the NN decisions and is essential to deploy NNs on
safety-critical systems. Recent works approximate the propagation of sets
through nonlinear activations or partition the uncertainty set to provide a
guaranteed outer bound on the set of possible NN outputs. However, the bound
looseness causes excessive conservatism and/or the computation is too slow for
online analysis. This paper unifies propagation and partition approaches to
provide a family of robustness analysis algorithms that give tighter bounds
than existing works for the same amount of computation time (or reduced
computational effort for a desired accuracy level). Moreover, we provide new
partitioning techniques that are aware of their current bound estimates and
desired boundary shape (e.g., lower bounds, weighted $\ell_\infty$-ball, convex
hull), leading to further improvements in the computation-tightness tradeoff.
The paper demonstrates the tighter bounds and reduced conservatism of the
proposed robustness analysis framework with examples from model-free RL and
forward kinematics learning.

producing percepts. We are endowed with an intuitive notion of similarity
between percepts, that need not reflect the proximity of the physical
properties of the corresponding external stimuli. The quantitative
characterization of the geometry of percepts is therefore an endeavour that
must be accomplished behaviorally. Here we characterized the geometry of color
space using discrimination and matching experiments. We proposed an
individually tailored metric defined in terms of the minimal chromatic
difference required for each observer to differentiate a stimulus from its
surround. Next, we showed that this perceptual metric was particularly adequate
to describe two additional experiments, since it revealed the natural symmetry
of perceptual computations. In one of the experiments, observers were required
to discriminate two stimuli surrounded by a chromaticity that differed from
that of the tested stimuli. In the perceptual coordinates, the change in
discrimination thresholds induced by the surround followed a simple law that
only depended on the perceptual distance between the surround and each of the
two compared stimuli. In the other experiment, subjects were asked to match the
color of two stimuli surrounded by two different chromaticities. Again, in the
perceptual coordinates the induction effect produced by surrounds followed a
simple, symmetric law. We conclude that the individually-tailored notion of
perceptual distance reveals the symmetry of the laws governing perceptual
computations.

generally requires the presence of surfaces -- for example, provided by

flat isotropic-nematic interfaces, radial hedgehog point defects and
half-integer wedge disclinations in the bulk and as stabilised by (charged)

band is first introduced in stable glasses via large-amplitude periodic shear,
and then amorphous samples are subjected to repeated loading during thousands
of cycles at strain amplitudes below the yield strain. It was found that with
increasing strain amplitude, the glasses are relocated to deeper potential
energy levels, while the energy change upon annealing is not affected by the
glass initial stability. The results of mechanical tests indicate that the
shear modulus and yield stress both increase towards plateau levels during the
first few hundred cycles, and their magnitudes are largest when samples are
loaded at strain amplitudes close to the yield strain. The analysis of
nonaffine displacements reveals that the shear band breaks up into isolated
clusters that gradually decay over time, leading to nearly reversible
deformation within the elastic range. These results might be useful for

properties of this PCA game and the behavior of its gradient based updates. The
resulting algorithm -- which combines elements from Oja's rule with a
generalized Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization -- is naturally decentralized and
hence parallelizable through message passing. We demonstrate the scalability of
the algorithm with experiments on large image datasets and neural network
activations. We discuss how this new view of PCA as a differentiable game can
lead to further algorithmic developments and insights.

optimization problems. Such formulations correspond to determining an optimal

flow, where variables represent flows on individual arcs of the network. For
$\mathcal{NP}$-hard problems, polynomial-sized arc flow models typically
provide weak linear relaxations and may have too much symmetry to be efficient
in practice. Instead, arc flow models with a pseudo-polynomial size usually
provide strong relaxations and are efficient in practice. The interest in
pseudo-polynomial arc flow formulations has grown considerably in the last
twenty years, in which they have been used to solve many open instances of hard
problems. A remarkable advantage of pseudo-polynomial arc flow models is the
possibility to solve practical-sized instances directly by a Mixed Integer
Linear Programming solver, avoiding the implementation of complex methods based
on column generation.
  In this survey, we present theoretical foundations of pseudo-polynomial arc
flow formulations, by showing a relation between their network and Dynamic
Programming (DP). This relation allows a better understanding of the strength
of these formulations, through a link with models obtained by Dantzig-Wolfe
decomposition. The relation with DP also allows a new perspective to relate
state-space relaxation methods for DP with arc flow models. We also present a
dual point of view to contrast the linear relaxation of arc flow models with
that of models based on paths and cycles. To conclude, we review the main
solution methods and applications of arc flow models based on DP in several
domains such as cutting, packing, scheduling, and routing.

the absence of interactions with a huge number of solvent particles, the

coarse-grained model for lipids in implicit water. The model is called
SiMPLISTIC, which abbreviates for Single-site Model with Pairwise interaction
for Lipids in Implicit Solvent with Tuneable Intrinsic Curvature. SiMPLISTIC
lipids rapidly self-assemble into realistic non-lamellar and lamellar phases
such as inverted micelles and bilayers, the spontaneous curvature of the phase
being determined by a single free parameter of the model. Model membrane
simulations with the lamellar lipids show satisfactory fluid and gel phases
with no interdigitation or tilt. The model lipids follow rigid body dynamics
suggested by empirical studies, and generate bilayer elastic properties
consistent with experiments and other simulations. SiMPLISTIC can also simulate
mixtures of lipids that differ in their packing parameter or length, the latter
leading to the phenomenon of hydrophobic mismatch driven domain formation. The
model has a large scope due to its speed, conceptual and computational
simplicity, and versatility. Applications may range from large-scale
simulations for academic and industrial research on various lipid-based

singular periodic orbits are trajectories of the vector field whose $\alpha$-

darts. If one stands at distance $d>0$ and aims at $a\in \mathbb{R}^n$, then
the dart (modelled by a random vector $X$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$) hits a random
point given by $a+dX$. Next, given a payoff function $f$, one considers $$
\sup_a Ef(a+dX) $$ and asks if this is decreasing in $d$; i.e., whether it is
better to stand closer rather than farther from the target. Perhaps
surprisingly, this is not always the case and understanding when this does or
does not occur is the purpose of this paper.
  We show that if $X$ has a so-called selfdecomposable distribution, then it is
always better to stand closer for any payoff function. This class includes all
stable distributions as well as many more.
  On the other hand, if the payoff function is $\cos(x)$, then it is always
better to stand closer if and only if the characteristic function $|\phi_X(t)|$
is decreasing on $[0,\infty)$. We will then show that if there are at least two
point masses, then it is not always better to stand closer using $\cos(x)$. If
there is a single point mass, one can find a different payoff function to
obtain this phenomenon.
  Another large class of darts $X$ for which there are bounded continuous
payoff functions for which it is not always better to stand closer are
distributions with compact support. This will be obtained by using the fact
that the Fourier transform of such distributions has a zero in the complex
plane. This argument will work whenever there is a complex zero of the Fourier
transform.
  Finally, we analyze if the property of it being better to stand closer is
closed under convolution and/or limits.

analyzing sequences of numerical values ordered in time. Time series are
particularly interesting because they allow us to visualize and understand the

relationships and similarities across the data. There exists numerous fields
containing data in the form of time series: health care (electrocardiogram,
blood sugar, etc.), activity recognition, remote sensing, finance (stock market

constructing algorithms dedicated to automatically label time series data. The
sequential aspect of time series data requires the development of algorithms
that are able to harness this temporal property, thus making the existing
off-the-shelf machine learning models for traditional tabular data suboptimal
for solving the underlying task. In this context, deep learning has emerged in
recent years as one of the most effective methods for tackling the supervised

high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors is characterised by multiple
temperature scales, and a phenomenology that deviates significantly from the
conventional paradigm of superconductivity. Below the ""pseudogap"" temperature,
$T^*$, a range of experiments indicate a reduction in the density of states.
Lower in temperature, $T_\mathrm{c}$ marks the onset of a bulk zero-resistance
state. Intermediate between these, numerous other temperature boundaries and
cross-overs have been identified, often postulated to be associated with
fluctuations of some kind. However, for the most part there is little consensus
either over their definitions or the physical mechanisms at play. One of these
temperature scales is the Nernst onset temperature, $T_\mathrm{onset}$, below
which thermoelectric phenomena characteristic of superconductivity are
observed. Depending on the material, the difference between $T_\mathrm{onset}$
and $T_\mathrm{c}$ ranges from almost nothing to over 100K. In this paper, we
identify $T_\mathrm{onset}$ from published experimental data according to a
consistent definition; this reveals a remarkable consistency of behaviour
across the whole high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ family, despite the appreciable variations
in other parameters. Our analysis suggests that in the cuprates there is an
inherent limit to $T_\mathrm{c} \sim 135$K. We compare this behaviour with
other strongly-correlated superconductors and propose a unified picture of
superconducting fluctuations close to the Mott state.

problem in autonomous driving and mobile robotics due to season, illumination
variance, etc. Image retrieval for localization is an efficient and effective
solution to the problem. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-task
architecture to fuse the geometric and semantic information into the
multi-scale latent embedding representation for visual place recognition. To
use the high-quality ground truths without any human effort, the effective
multi-scale feature discriminator is proposed for adversarial training to
achieve the domain adaptation from synthetic virtual KITTI dataset to
real-world KITTI dataset. The proposed approach is validated on the Extended
CMU-Seasons dataset and Oxford RobotCar dataset through a series of crucial
comparison experiments, where our performance outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines for retrieval-based localization and large-scale place recognition
under the challenging environment.

measure-preserving system $Y$ by a compact group $K$, by showing that such
extensions are isomorphic to a group skew-product $X \equiv Y \rtimes_\rho H$
for some closed subgroup $H$ of $K$. An analogous theorem is also available for
ergodic homogeneous extensions $X$ of $Y$, namely that they are isomorphic to a
homogeneous skew-product $Y \rtimes_\rho H/M$. These theorems have many uses in
ergodic theory, for instance playing a key role in the Host-Kra structural
theory of characteristic factors of measure-preserving systems.
  The existing proofs of the Mackey-Zimmer theorem require various
""countability"", ""separability"", or ""metrizability"" hypotheses on the group
$\Gamma$ that acts on the system, the base space $Y$, and the group $K$ used to
perform the extension. In this paper we generalize the Mackey-Zimmer theorem to
""uncountable"" settings in which these hypotheses are omitted, at the cost of
making the notion of a measure-preserving system and a group extension more
abstract. However, this abstraction is partially counteracted by the use of a
""canonical model"" for abstract measure-preserving systems developed in a
companion paper. In subsequent work we will apply this theorem to also obtain
uncountable versions of the Host-Kra structural theory.

agents to outcomes that are poor (inefficient) not only for the group, but also
for each individual. Price of anarchy is a technical, game-theoretic definition
that quantifies the inefficiency arising in these scenarios -- it compares the
welfare that can be achieved through perfect coordination against that achieved
by self-interested agents at a Nash equilibrium. We derive a differentiable,
upper bound on a price of anarchy that agents can cheaply estimate during
learning. Equipped with this estimator, agents can adjust their incentives in a
way that improves the efficiency incurred at a Nash equilibrium. Agents do so
by learning to mix their reward (equiv. negative loss) with that of other
agents by following the gradient of our derived upper bound. We refer to this
approach as D3C. In the case where agent incentives are differentiable, D3C
resembles the celebrated Win-Stay, Lose-Shift strategy from behavioral game
theory, thereby establishing a connection between the global goal of maximum
welfare and an established agent-centric learning rule. In the
non-differentiable setting, as is common in multiagent reinforcement learning,
we show the upper bound can be reduced via evolutionary strategies, until a
compromise is reached in a distributed fashion. We demonstrate that D3C
improves outcomes for each agent and the group as a whole on several social
dilemmas including a traffic network exhibiting Braess's paradox, a prisoner's
dilemma, and several multiagent domains.

with orbital Mach numbers at the inner edge of the disk $M_{\rm in}$ of 5 and
10. We find mass accretion rates to vary considerably on all time scales, with
only the Mach 5 model reaching a clear quasi-stationary state. For Mach 10, the
model undergoes an outside-in magnetically-driven accretion event occurring on
a time scale of $\sim10$ orbital periods of the binary. Both models exhibit
spiral shocks inclined with respect to the binary plane, with their position
and inclination changing rapidly. However, the time-averaged location of these
shocks in the equatorial plane is well-fit by simple linear models. MRI
turbulence in the disk generates toroidal magnetic field patterns (butterfly
diagrams) that are in some cases irregular, perhaps due to interaction with
spiral structure. While many of our results are in good agreement with local
studies, we find some features (most notably those related to spiral shocks)
can only be captured in global models such as studied here. Thus, while global
studies remain computationally expensive -- even as idealized models -- they
are essential (along with more sophisticated treatment of radiation transport
and disk thermodynamics) for furthering our understanding of accretion in
binary systems.

of deep ReLU networks can learn the latent variables in HLTM, despite the fact
that the network receives \emph{no direct supervision} from these unobserved

Moreover, we reveal a large and dominant anomalous contribution to resistive
currents, which reaches its maximum at the lowest attained temperature,

a collection of optimally driven non-interacting and interacting qubits.
Remarkably, for refrigerators the non-interacting qubits perform almost as well

Employing the U(4) (U(4)$\times$U(4)) symmetries in the nonchiral (chiral) flat
band limit, we reduced the Hilbert space to an extent which allows for study
around $\nu=\pm 3,\pm2,\pm1$ fillings. In the first chiral limit $w_0/w_1=0$
where $w_0$ ($w_1$) is the $AA$ ($AB$) stacking hopping, we find that the

determinants in a so-called Chern basis, and the exactly solvable charge $\pm1$
excitations found in [arXiv:2009.14200] are the lowest charge excitations up to
system sizes $8\times8$ (for restricted Hilbert space) in the chiral-flat

For $\nu=-3$, the ground state is the spin and valley polarized Chern insulator

$\nu=-2$, we can only numerically access the valley polarized sector, and we
find a spin ferromagnetic phase when $w_0/w_1\gtrsim0.5t$ where $t\in[0,1]$ is
the factor of rescaling of the actual TBG bandwidth, and a spin singlet phase
otherwise, confirming the perturbative calculation [arXiv:2009.13530]. The
analytic FMC ground state is, however, predicted in the intervalley coherent
sector which we cannot access [arXiv:2009.13530]. For $\nu=-3$ with/without

approach the optimal rate. The techniques that we employ rely on the connection
of this problem with constrained systems. In the second part of the paper we
consider a modification of the problem wherein the entries in the sequence are
viewed as random variables over a finite alphabet that follow some joint
distribution, and the recovery condition requires that the Shannon entropy of
the $k$-tuple conditioned on its $l$-neighborhood be bounded above by some
$\epsilon>0.$ We study properties of measures on infinite sequences that
maximize the metric entropy under the recoverability condition. Drawing on

tempered by concerns about its role in inflaming the 'culture wars'. Via mass
selection into like-minded groups, online society may be becoming more
fragmented and polarized, particularly with respect to partisan differences.
However, our ability to measure the social makeup of online communities, and in
turn understand the social organization of online platforms, is limited by the
pseudonymous, unstructured, and large-scale nature of digital discussion. We
develop a neural embedding methodology to quantify the positioning of online
communities along social dimensions by leveraging large-scale patterns of
aggregate behaviour. Applying our methodology to 5.1B Reddit comments made in
10K communities over 14 years, we measure how the macroscale community
structure is organized with respect to age, gender, and U.S. political
partisanship. Examining political content, we find Reddit underwent a
significant polarization event around the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and
remained highly polarized for years afterward. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
however, individual-level polarization is rare; the system-level shift in 2016
was disproportionately driven by the arrival of new and newly political users.
Political polarization on Reddit is unrelated to previous activity on the
platform, and is instead temporally aligned with external events. We also
observe a stark ideological asymmetry, with the sharp increase in 2016 being
entirely attributable to changes in right-wing activity. Our methodology is
broadly applicable to the study of online interaction, and our findings have
implications for the design of online platforms, understanding the social
contexts of online behaviour, and quantifying the dynamics and mechanisms of
online polarization.

intergalactic medium at redshifts $z\gtrsim6$. However, the Lyman continuum is
not directly observable at these redshifts and secondary indicators of Lyman
continuum escape must be used to estimate the budget of ionizing photons.
Observationally, at redshifts $z\sim2-3$ where the Lyman continuum is
observationally accessible, surveys have established that many objects that
show appreciable Lyman continuum escape fractions $f_{esc}$ also show enhanced
[OIII]/[OII] (O$_{32}$) emission line ratios. Here, we use radiative transfer
analyses of cosmological zoom-in simulations of galaxy formation to study the
physical connection between $f_{esc}$ and O$_{32}$. Like the observations, we
find that the largest $f_{esc}$ values occur at elevated O$_{32}\sim3-10$ and
that the combination of high $f_{esc}$ and low O$_{32}$ is extremely rare.
While high $f_{esc}$ and O$_{32}$ often are observable concurrently, the
timescales of the physical origin for the processes are very different. Large
O$_{32}$ values fluctuate on short ($\sim$1 Myr) timescales during the
Wolf-Rayet-powered phase after the formation of star clusters, while channels
of low absorption are established over tens of megayears by collections of
supernovae. We find that while there is no direct causal relation between
$f_{esc}$ and O$_{32}$, high $f_{esc}$ most often occurs after continuous input
from star formation-related feedback events that have corresponding excursions
to large O$_{32}$ emission. These calculations are in agreement with
interpretations of observations that large $f_{esc}$ tends to occur when
O$_{32}$ is large, but large O$_{32}$ does not necessarily imply efficient
Lyman continuum escape.

The dataset includes photometric and spectroscopic monitoring in the optical
and ultraviolet, covering the H$\beta$, C IV, and Ly$\alpha$ broad emission
lines. We find an extended disk-like H$\beta$ BLR with a mixture of
near-circular and outflowing gas trajectories, while the C IV and Ly$\alpha$
BLRs are much less extended and resemble shell-like structures. There is clear
radial structure in the BLR, with C IV and Ly$\alpha$ emission arising at
smaller radii than the H$\beta$ emission. Using the three lines, we make three
independent black hole mass measurements, all of which are consistent.
Combining these results gives a joint inference of $\log_{10}(M_{\rm
BH}/M_\odot) = 7.64^{+0.21}_{-0.18}$. We examine the effect of using the $V$
band instead of the UV continuum light curve on the results and find a size
difference that is consistent with the measured UV-optical time lag, but the
other structural and kinematic parameters remain unchanged, suggesting that the
$V$ band is a suitable proxy for the ionizing continuum when exploring the BLR
structure and kinematics. Finally, we compare the H$\beta$ results to similar
models of data obtained in 2008 when the AGN was at a lower luminosity state.
We find that the size of the emitting region increased during this time period,
but the geometry and black hole mass remain unchanged, which confirms that the
BLR kinematics suitably gauge the gravitational field of the central black
hole.

atomic dark matter (aDM). This arises in many scenarios of dark complexity, and
is a prediction of neutral naturalness, such as the Mirror Twin Higgs model. We
show for the first time how White Dwarf cooling provides strong bounds on aDM.
In the presence of a small kinetic mixing between the dark and SM photon, stars
are expected to accumulate atomic dark matter in their cores, which then
radiates away energy in the form of dark photons. In the case of white dwarfs,
this energy loss can have a detectable impact on their cooling rate. We use
measurements of the white dwarf luminosity function to tightly constrain the
kinetic mixing parameter between the dark and visible photons, across many
orders of magnitude in DM mass, down to values of $\epsilon \sim 10^{-12}$.
Using this method we can constrain scenarios in which aDM constitutes fractions
as small as $10^{-3}$ of the total dark matter density. Our methods are highly
complementary to other methods of probing aDM, especially in scenarios where
the aDM is arranged in a dark disk, which can make direct detection extremely

to explore efficient modeling approaches beyond traditional MCMC techniques
that are time consuming. We train a CNN on images of galaxy-scale lenses to
predict the parameters of the SIE mass model ($x,y,e_x,e_y$, and $\theta_E$).
To train the network, we simulate images based on real observations from the
HSC Survey for the lens galaxies and from the HUDF as lensed galaxies. We
tested different network architectures, the effect of different data sets, and
using different input distributions of $\theta_E$. We find that the CNN
performs well and obtain with the network trained with a uniform distribution
of $\theta_E$ $>0.5""$ the following median values with $1\sigma$ scatter:
$\Delta x=(0.00^{+0.30}_{-0.30})""$, $\Delta y=(0.00^{+0.30}_{-0.29})"" $,

systems with small $\theta_E$. Therefore, when we further predict the multiple
lensed image positions and time delays based on the network output, we apply
the network to the sample limited to $\theta_E>0.8""$. In this case, the offset
between the predicted and input lensed image positions is
$(0.00_{-0.29}^{+0.29})""$ and $(0.00_{-0.31}^{+0.32})""$ for $x$ and $y$,

by considering the PDF as a dynamical system, not a stationary one. We derive
the transport equations of the density PDF, characterize its evolution and
determine the density threshold above which gravity strongly affects and
eventually dominates the dynamics of turbulence. We demonstrate the occurence
of {\it two} power law tails in the PDF, with two characteristic exponents,
corresponding to two different stages in the balance between turbulence and
gravity. Another important result of this study is to provide a procedure to
relate the observed {\it column density} PDFs to the corresponding {\it volume
density} PDFs. This allows to infer, from the observation of column-densities,
various physical parameters characterizing molecular clouds, notably the virial
parameter. Furthermore, the theory offers the possibility to date the clouds in
units of ${t}_{\rm coll}$, the time since a statistically significant fraction
of the cloud started to collapse. The theoretical results and diagnostics
reproduce very well numerical simulations and observations of star-forming
clouds. The theory provides a sound theoretical foundation and quantitative
diagnostics to analyze observations or numerical simulations of star-forming
regions and to characterize the evolution of the density PDF in various regions
of molecular clouds.

(CO) luminosity function and mean molecular gas density through blind
detections of CO emission lines. While the cosmic star formation rate density
is now constrained in fields hundreds of arcmin$^2$ or more, molecular gas
studies have been limited to $\le50$ arcmin$^2$. These small fields result in
significant biases that have not been accounted for in published results. To
quantify these biases, we assign CO luminosities to halos in cosmological
simulations to produce mock observations for a range of field sizes. We find
that fields $\lesssim 10$ arcmin$^2$ alter the recovered shape of the
luminosity function, causing underestimates of the number of bright objects.
Our models suggest that current surveys are sensitive enough to detect sources
responsible for approximately half of the cosmic molecular gas density at high
redshift. However, uncertainties in the gas density measurement are large, and
cosmic variance may double the uncertainty claimed in these surveys. As a
result, the field size needed to detect redshift evolution in the molecular gas
at high confidence may be more than an order of magnitude larger than what
current surveys have achieved. Shot power intensity mapping measurements are
particularly sensitive to Poisson variance and require yet larger areas to
constrain the gas density or its evolution. We provide a simple prescription
for approximating uncertainty in total CO emission as a function of survey area

birth is poorly known but is likely to be much more complex than a dipole.
Thus, we explore a wide range of initial configurations, finding that the

the initial magnetic configuration. Our results show that this rate scales with
the crustal magnetic energy, rather than with the often used surface value of
the dipolar component related to the spin-down torque. The estimated frequency
of crustal failures for a given dipolar component can vary by orders of

newborn magnetars. The quantitative reliability of the expected event rate
could be improved by a better treatment of the magnetic evolution in the core

Josephson junctions, are one of the leading platforms for emerging quantum
technologies. Increasing circuit complexity further requires efficient methods
for the calculation and optimization of the spectrum, nonlinear interactions,
and dissipation in multi-mode distributed quantum circuits. Here, we present a
method based on the energy-participation ratio (EPR) of a dissipative or
nonlinear element in an electromagnetic mode. The EPR, a number between zero
and one, quantifies how much of the energy of a mode is stored in each element.
It obeys universal constraints--valid regardless of the circuit topology and
nature of the nonlinear elements. The EPR of the elements are calculated from a
unique, efficient electromagnetic eigenmode simulation of the linearized
circuit, including lossy elements. Their set is the key input to the
determination of the quantum Hamiltonian of the system. The method provides an
intuitive and simple-to-use tool to quantize multi-junction circuits. It is
especially well-suited for finding the Hamiltonian and dissipative parameters
of weakly anharmonic systems, such as transmon qubits coupled to resonators, or
Josephson transmission lines. We experimentally tested this method on a variety
of Josephson circuits, and demonstrated agreement within several percents for
nonlinear couplings and modal Hamiltonian parameters, spanning five-orders of
magnitude in energy, across a dozen samples.

number of channel uses, $N$. More specifically, the 'interaction' probability
in our protocol decays as $\frac{1}{N}$ and we show that this rate is the
optimal achievable one. Furthermore, our protocol only needs at most one

the case where our condition does not hold, we prove an inequality that

collaboration of national and world health groups. However, it may come under
additional stress in the 21st century as the field intersects with the
cyberworld -- a world where governments have already been struggling to keep up
with cyber attacks from small to state-level actors as cyberthreats have been
relied on to level the playing field in international disputes. Disruptions to
military logistics and economies through cyberattacks have been able to be done
at a mere fraction of economic and moral costs through conventional military
means, making it an increasingly tempting means of disruption. In the field of
biocybersecurity (BCS), the strengths within biotechnology and cybersecurity
merge, along with many of their vulnerabilities, and this could spell increased
trouble for biodefense, as novel threats can be synthesized and disseminated in
ways that fuse the routes of attacks seen in biosecurity and cybersecurity.

introduced. Governed by a positive parameter $\kappa$ called the cycle counter,
this scheme generates a family of multigrid cycles dubbed $\kappa$-cycles. The
well-known $V$-cycle, $F$-cycle, and $W$-cycle are shown to be particular
members of this rich $\kappa$-cycle family, which satisfies the property that
the total number of recursive calls in a single cycle is a polynomial of degree
$\kappa$ in the number of levels of the cycle. This broadening of the scope of
fixed multigrid cycles is shown to be potentially significant for the solution
of some large problems on platforms, such as GPU processors, where the overhead
induced by numerous sequential calls to the coarser levels may be relatively
significant. In cases of problems for which the convergence of standard
$V$-cycles or $F$-cycles (corresponding to $\kappa=1$ and $\kappa=2$,
respectively) is particularly slow, and yet the cost of $W$-cycles is very high
due to the large number of coarse-level calls (which is exponential in the
number of levels), intermediate values of $\kappa$ may prove to yield
significantly faster run-times. This is demonstrated in examples where
$\kappa$-cycles are used for the solution of rotated anisotropic diffusion
problems, both as a stand-alone solver and as a preconditioner. Moreover, a
simple model is presented for predicting the approximate run-time of the
$\kappa$-cycle, which is useful in pre-selecting an appropriate cycle counter
for a given problem on a given platform. Implementing the $\kappa$-cycle
requires making just a small change in the classical multigrid cycle.

such ansatze used in variational quantum algorithms, which we call
""Parameter-Efficient Circuit Training"" (PECT). Instead of optimizing all of the
ansatz parameters at once, PECT launches a sequence of variational algorithms,
in which each iteration of the algorithm activates and optimizes a subset of
the total parameter set. To update the parameter subset between iterations, we
adapt the dynamic sparse reparameterization scheme by Mostafa et al.
(arXiv:1902.05967). We demonstrate PECT for the Variational Quantum
Eigensolver, in which we benchmark unitary coupled-cluster ansatze including
UCCSD and k-UpCCGSD, as well as the low-depth circuit ansatz (LDCA), to
estimate ground state energies of molecular systems. We additionally use a
layerwise variant of PECT to optimize a hardware-efficient circuit for the
Sycamore processor to estimate the ground state energy densities of the
one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. From our numerical data, we find that PECT
can enable optimizations of certain ansatze that were previously difficult to
converge and more generally can improve the performance of variational
algorithms by reducing the optimization runtime and/or the depth of circuits
that encode the solution candidate(s).

when image features are very small (8 pixels). Our approach modifies the
effective receptive field at different layers in a CNN so that objects with a
broad range of varying scales can be detected in a single forward pass. We
define rules for computing adaptive prior anchor boxes which we show are
solvable under the equal proportion interval principle. Two mechanisms in our
CNN architecture alleviate the effects of non-discriminative features prevalent
in our data - a foveal detection algorithm that incorporates a cascade
residual-inception module and a deconvolution module with additional context
information. When integrated into a Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), these
additions permit more accurate detection of small-scale objects. The results
permit efficient real-time analysis of medical images in pathology and related
biomedical research fields.

complex distributions of small images. However, sampling from them requires
expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations that mix slowly in high
dimensional pixel space. Unlike EBMs, variational autoencoders (VAEs) generate
samples quickly and are equipped with a latent space that enables fast
traversal of the data manifold. However, VAEs tend to assign high probability
density to regions in data space outside the actual data distribution and often
fail at generating sharp images. In this paper, we propose VAEBM, a symbiotic
composition of a VAE and an EBM that offers the best of both worlds. VAEBM
captures the overall mode structure of the data distribution using a
state-of-the-art VAE and it relies on its EBM component to explicitly exclude
non-data-like regions from the model and refine the image samples. Moreover,
the VAE component in VAEBM allows us to speed up MCMC updates by
reparameterizing them in the VAE's latent space. Our experimental results show
that VAEBM outperforms state-of-the-art VAEs and EBMs in generative quality on
several benchmark image datasets by a large margin. It can generate
high-quality images as large as 256$\times$256 pixels with short MCMC chains.
We also demonstrate that VAEBM provides complete mode coverage and performs
well in out-of-distribution detection. The source code is available at

concentrated in transmodal association cortex. However, understanding of this
pathophysiology has been limited by an exclusive focus on the direct

both direct and indirect structural connections to a region to gain new
insights into the pathophysiology of the psychosis spectrum.
  We used psychosis symptom data and structural connectivity in 1,068 youths
aged 8 to 22 years from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort. Applying a
Network Control Theory metric called average controllability, we estimated each
brain region's capacity to leverage its direct and indirect structural
connections to control linear brain dynamics. Next, using non-linear
regression, we determined the accuracy with which average controllability could
predict negative and positive psychosis spectrum symptoms in out-of-sample
testing. We also compared prediction performance for average controllability
versus strength, which indexes only direct connections to a region. Finally, we
assessed how the prediction performance for psychosis spectrum symptoms varied
over the functional hierarchy spanning unimodal to transmodal cortex.
  Average controllability outperformed strength at predicting positive
psychosis spectrum symptoms, demonstrating that indexing indirect structural
connections to a region improved prediction performance. Critically, improved
prediction was concentrated in association cortex for average controllability,
whereas prediction performance for strength was uniform across the cortex,
suggesting that indexing indirect connections is crucial in association cortex.
  Examining inter-individual variation in direct and indirect structural
connections to association cortex is crucial for accurate prediction of
positive psychosis spectrum symptoms.

design challenges shift from the wireless network itself to the computational
support behind the wireless network. In this vein, there is new interest in
quantum-compute approaches because of their potential to substantially speed up
processing, and so improve network throughput. However, quantum hardware that
actually exists today is much more susceptible to computational errors than
silicon-based hardware, due to the physical phenomena of decoherence and noise.
This paper explores the boundary between the two types of
computation---classical-quantum hybrid processing for optimization problems in
wireless systems---envisioning how wireless can simultaneously leverage the
benefit of both approaches. We explore the feasibility of a hybrid system with
a real hardware prototype using one of the most advanced experimentally
available techniques today, reverse quantum annealing. Preliminary results on a
low-latency, large MIMO system envisioned in the 5G New Radio roadmap are
encouraging, showing approximately 2--10X better performance in terms of
processing time than prior published results.

the Dragonfly Telephoto Array. Our plans focus on the development of the
`Dragonfly Filter-Tilter', a device which places ultra-narrow bandpass
interference filters ($\Delta\lambda \approx 1$ nm) in front of each of the
lenses that make up the array. The filters are at the entrance pupil of the
optical system, rather than in a converging beam, so their performance is not
degraded by a converging light cone. This allows Dragonfly to image with a
spectral bandpass that is an order of magnitude narrower than that of
telescopes using conventional narrow-band filters, resulting in a large
increase in the contrast and detectability of extended low surface brightness
line emission. By tilting the filters, the central wavelength of the
transmission curve can be tuned over a range of 7 nm, corresponding to a
physical distance range of about 20 Mpc of extragalactic targets. A further
benefit of our approach is that it allows off-band observations to be obtained
at the same time as on-band observations, so systematic errors introduced by
rapid sky variability can be removed with high precision. Taken together, these
characteristics should give our imaging system the ability to detect extremely
faint low-surface brightness line emission. Future versions of the Dragonfly
Telephoto Array may have the sensitivity needed to directly image the
circumgalactic medium of local galaxies. In this paper, we provide a detailed
description of the concept, and present laboratory measurements that are used
to verify the key ideas behind the instrument.

similar parameters, significant differences occasionally arise between them, as
well as between our preferred model and the literature values. Nevertheless,
our preferred models are consistent with published phase offsets to within

for actively monitoring residential, commercial, and industrial spaces.
Analytes such as toxic industrial compounds (TICs), chemical warfare agents
(CWAs), and environmental pollutants (EPs) can pose serious threats to
civilians, warfighters, and the environment. We report on highly sensitive,
robust, and inexpensive distributed standoff fiber optic chemical sensors
(FOCSs). FOCSs are activated by analytes reaching a sensing region and inducing
a change in its optical properties. The information of a spectral response is
transmitted by a shift in transmission spectra probed by evanescent waves,
corresponding to the detection of an analyte. However, there are many factors
that play a role in the implementation and optimization of such fiber sensors.
We find it beneficial to construct the theory of general optochemical waveguide
sensors to guide the analysis. We apply it to a specific fiber platfom that is
robust, broadband, multi-target, scalable, and compatible to texitle fibers and
fabrics - a focus of this work. The good agreement between the predicted and
measured spectra of FOCSs exposed to Ammonia (NH$_3$) lends support to the
analysis. The experiment yields a 1ppm sensitivity, representing the current
best in class. The use of NH$_3$ in the test serves as a representative for a
larger set of amine-based TICs, CWAs, EPs, and other chemical species, targeted

based on the primary galaxy color: red and blue primary galaxies separated at
$(g-r)_{0} = 0.85$. The central stellar velocity dispersions of the primary
galaxies are proportional to the luminosities and stellar masses of the same
galaxies. Stacking the sample based on the central velocity dispersion of the
primary galaxies, we derive the velocity dispersions of their satellite
galaxies, which trace the dark matter halo mass of the primary galaxies. The
system velocity dispersion of the satellite galaxies shows a remarkably tight
correlation with the central velocity dispersion of the primary galaxies for
both red and blue samples. In particular, the slope of the relation is
identical to 1 for red primary systems. This tight relation suggests that the

software product as input and produces some useful information about that
product as output. A software product line encompasses \emph{many} software
product variants, and thus existing analyses can be applied to each of the
product variations individually, but not to the entire product line as a whole.
Enumerating all product variants and analyzing them one by one is usually
intractable due to the combinatorial explosion of the number of product
variants with respect to product line features. Several software analyses
(e.g., type checkers, model checkers, data flow analyses) have been
redesigned/re-implemented to support variability. This usually requires a lot
of time and effort, and the variability-aware version of the analysis might
have new errors/bugs that do not exist in the original one.
  Given an analysis program written in a functional language based on PCF, in
this paper we present two approaches to transforming (lifting) it into a
semantically equivalent variability-aware analysis. A light-weight approach
(referred to as \emph{shallow lifting}) wraps the analysis program into a
variability-aware version, exploring all combinations of its input arguments.
Deep lifting, on the other hand, is a program rewriting mechanism where the
syntactic constructs of the input program are rewritten into their
variability-aware counterparts. Compositionally this results in an efficient
program semantically equivalent to the input program, modulo variability. We
present the correctness criteria for functional program lifting, together with
correctness proof sketches of our program transformations. We evaluate our
approach on a set of program analyses applied to the BusyBox C-language product

theory violates the RMHD rescaling symmetry can be reconciled with alignment if
the latter is understood as an intermittency effect. Boldyrev's scalings,
recovered in this interpretation, are thus an example of a physical theory of
intermittency in a turbulent system. Emergence of aligned structures brings in
reconnection physics, so the theory of MHD turbulence intertwines with the
physics of tearing and current-sheet disruption. Recent work on this by
Loureiro, Mallet et al. is reviewed and it is argued that we finally have a
reasonably complete picture of MHD cascade all the way to the dissipation
scale. This picture appears to reconcile Beresnyak's Kolmogorov scaling of the
dissipation cutoff with Boldyrev's aligned cascade. These ideas also enable
some progress in understanding saturated MHD dynamo, argued to be controlled by
reconnection and to contain, at small scales, a tearing-mediated cascade
similar to its strong-mean-field counterpart. On the margins of this core
narrative, standard weak-MHD-turbulence theory is argued to require adjustment
- and a scheme for it is proposed - to take account of the part that a
spontaneously emergent 2D condensate plays in mediating the Alfven-wave
cascade. This completes the picture of the MHD cascade at large scales. A
number of outstanding issues are surveyed, concerning imbalanced MHD turbulence
(for which a new theory is proposed), residual energy, subviscous and decaying
regimes of MHD turbulence (where reconnection again features prominently).
Finally, it is argued that the natural direction of research is now away from
MHD and into kinetic territory.

dereflection algorithm that uses stereo images as input. This is an effective
trade-off between the two extremes: the parallax between two views provides
cues to remove reflections, and two views are easy to capture due to the
adoption of stereo cameras in smartphones. Our model consists of a
learning-based reflection-invariant flow model for dual-view registration, and
a learned synthesis model for combining aligned image pairs. Because no dataset
for dual-view reflection removal exists, we render a synthetic dataset of
dual-views with and without reflections for use in training. Our evaluation on
an additional real-world dataset of stereo pairs shows that our algorithm
outperforms existing single-image and multi-image dereflection approaches.

in spatially non-uniform, intense laser fields. Laser non-uniformities occur
when a perfect plane wave reflects off a randomly perturbed surface. By solving
for three-dimensional particle trajectories in the electromagnetic field of a
randomly perturbed laser, we are able to generate electron energy spectra with
temperatures well above the ponderomotive scaling, as observed in many
experiments. The simulations show that high electron energies can be achieved
by the laser fields alone, without the need for plasma fields. The
characteristic temperatures of the electron spectra are determined by the
characteristic features of the laser field turbulence. The process is very
rapid, occurring on 10-50fs timescales, indicating it is likely a dominant
acceleration mechanism in short-pulse laser-solid interactions when the
intensity is at or below the relativistic threshold. A simple analytic model
shows how electrons can reach high energy by undergoing repeated acceleration
in laser wavelets for short periods of time.

predicted black hole pair-instability mass gap. One proposed scenario is the
dynamical merger of two stars below the pair instability regime forming a star
with a small core and an over-sized envelope. We explore this scenario with
detailed stellar evolution calculations, starting with ad-hoc initial
conditions enforcing no core growth during the merger. We outline the main
challenges this scenario has to overcome, in particular the requirement to
retain enough of its mass at merger time, in the subsequent evolution, and at
core-collapse. We found that these massive merger products are likely
helium-rich, and spend most of their remaining lifetime within regions of the
Herzsprung-Russell diagram where envelope instabilities akin to luminous blue
variable (LBV) eruptions are expected. An energetic estimate of the amount of
mass loss neglecting the back-reaction of the star suggests that the total
amount of mass that can be removed at low metallicity is . 1 M . This is small
enough that at core-collapse our models are retaining sufficient mass to form
black holes in the pair-instability gap similar to the recent ones detected by
LIGO/Virgo. However, mass loss at the time of merger and the neutrino-driven
mass loss at core collapse still need to be quantified for these models in
order to confirm the viability of this scenario.

well-spread (i.e., non-sparse) vectors, our embedding method applies a stable
noise-shaping quantization scheme to $A x$ where $A\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$
is a sparse Gaussian random matrix. This contrasts with most binary embedding
methods, which usually use $x\mapsto \mathrm{sign}(Ax)$ for the embedding.
Moreover, we show that Euclidean distances among the elements of $\mathcal{T}$
are approximated by the $\ell_1$ norm on the images of $\{\pm 1\}^m$ under a
fast linear transformation. This again contrasts with standard methods, where
the Hamming distance is used instead. Our method is both fast and memory
efficient, with time complexity $O(m)$ and space complexity $O(m)$. Further, we
prove that the method is accurate and its associated error is comparable to
that of a continuous valued Johnson-Lindenstrauss embedding plus a quantization
error that admits a polynomial decay as the embedding dimension $m$ increases.
Thus the length of the binary codes required to achieve a desired accuracy is
quite small, and we show it can even be compressed further without compromising
the accuracy. To illustrate our results, we test the proposed method on natural
images and show that it achieves strong performance.

is associated with the Hawking-Page transition of a thermal anti-de Sitter
(AdS) space to an AdS black hole. In the case of the hard wall model, the
thermal transition takes place in the planar AdS thanks to the introduction of
an infrared cut-off in the geometry. The corresponding thermodynamic entropy of
the $SU(N) $ gauge theory jumps from proportional to $N^0$ in the confined
hadronic phase to proportional to $N^2$ in the plasma phase, corresponding to
the presence of the color degrees of freedom. The Hawking-Page transition is
understood by considering a semiclassical picture of a system consisting of two
different geometries that are asymptotically AdS. One is the AdS black hole and
the other the thermal AdS space. The relative stability between these competing
geometries varies with the temperature. So, the transition is essentially a
problem of stability. An interesting tool to study stability of physical
systems is the configuration entropy (CE), inspired in the Shannon
informational entropy. In this work we investigate the CE for the case of the
AdS/QCD hard wall model at finite temperature. We propose a regularized form
for the energy densities of the black hole (BH) and of the thermal AdS
geometries that makes it possible to calculate their CEs as a function of the
temperature. We find a relation between stability and the value of the CE for
the system of asymptotically AdS geometries. Remarkably, it is found that the
CE is proportional to $\log(T)$, where $T$ is the temperature. This result
makes it possible to write out a simple relation between the configuration and
the thermodynamic entropies.

for prediction models. For pipeline modeling algorithms (i.e. modeling
procedures with multiple steps), it has been recommended the entire sequence of
steps be carried out during each replicate of CV to mimic the application of
the entire pipeline to an external testing set. While theoretically sound,
following this recommendation can lead to high computational costs when a
pipeline modeling algorithm includes computationally expensive operations, e.g.
imputation of missing values. There is a general belief that unsupervised
variable selection (i.e. ignoring the outcome) can be applied before conducting
CV without incurring bias, but there is less consensus for unsupervised
imputation of missing values. We empirically assessed whether conducting
unsupervised imputation prior to CV would result in biased estimates of
generalization error or result in poorly selected tuning parameters and thus
degrade the external performance of downstream models. Results show that
despite optimistic bias, the reduced variance of imputation before CV compared
to imputation during each replicate of CV leads to a lower overall root mean
squared error for estimation of the true external R-squared and the performance
of models tuned using CV with imputation before versus during each replication
is minimally different. In conclusion, unsupervised imputation before CV
appears valid in certain settings and may be a helpful strategy that enables
analysts to use more flexible imputation techniques without incurring high
computational costs.

to the SDE models even when their PDFs are hardly derived in explicit forms due
to multiplicative-noise terms, nonlinear terms, and so on. Therefore, our
method is expected to provide a versatile tool to dynamically parameterize

obtained from a random dynamical system whose structure is described by a known
SDE model with unknown parameter values. With the help of It\^o calculus, the
Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) is derived from the SDE model. The measured PDF
and a candidate of parameter values are substituted into the FPE to calculate a

Traditional optimizers are cost-based and use statistical estimates of
intermediate result cardinalities to assign costs and pick the best plan.
However, such estimates tend to become less accurate because of filtering
conditions caused either from undetected correlations between multiple
predicates local to a single dataset, predicates with query parameters, or
predicates involving user-defined functions (UDFs). Consequently, traditional
query optimizers tend to ignore or miscalculate those settings, thus leading to
suboptimal execution plans. Given the volume of today's data, a suboptimal plan
can quickly become very inefficient.
  In this work, we revisit the old idea of runtime dynamic optimization and
adapt it to a shared-nothing distributed database system, AsterixDB. The
optimization runs in stages (re-optimization points), starting by first
executing all predicates local to a single dataset. The intermediate result
created from each stage is used to re-optimize the remaining query. This
re-optimization approach avoids inaccurate intermediate result cardinality
estimations, thus leading to much better execution plans. While it introduces
the overhead for materializing these intermediate results, our experiments show
that this overhead is relatively small and it is an acceptable price to pay
given the optimization benefits. In fact, our experimental evaluation shows
that runtime dynamic optimization leads to much better execution plans as
compared to the current default AsterixDB plans as well as to plans produced by
static cost-based optimization (i.e. based on the initial dataset statistics)
and other state-of-the-art approaches.

to propose a new centrality measure that assesses the importance of an

Physical layer security techniques have emerged as a simple and yet effective
way to safeguard these systems against eavesdropping attacks. These techniques
make use of the large antenna arrays available in mmWave systems to provide an
array gain at the target receiver and degrade the signal quality at the
eavesdropper. Despite their effectiveness, majority of these techniques are
based on line-of-sight communication links between the transmitter and the
receiver, and may fail in the presence of blockages or non-line-of-sight links.
This paper builds upon previous work and extends physical layer security to the
non-line-of-sight communication case and randomly located eavesdroppers.
Specifically, the large dimensional antenna arrays in mmWave systems and the
intrinsic characteristics of wireless channel are exploited to induce noiselike
signals that jam eavesdroppers with sensitive receivers. Numerical results show
that the proposed techniques provide higher secrecy rate when compared to
conventional array and physical layer techniques based on line-of-sight links.

In isotropic turbulence, the flux is given by a scalar as a function of the
magnitude of the wavenumber. On the other hand, the flux in anisotropic
turbulence should be a geometric vector that has a direction as well as the
magnitude, and depends not only on the magnitude of the wavenumber but also on
its direction. The energy-flux vector in the anisotropic turbulence cannot be
uniquely determined in a way used for the isotropic flux. In this work,
introducing two ansatzes, net locality and efficiency of the nonlinear energy
transfer, we propose a way to determine the energy-flux vector in anisotropic
turbulence by using the Moore--Penrose inverse. The energy-flux vector in
strongly rotating turbulence is demonstrated based on the energy transfer rate
obtained by direct numerical simulations. It is found that the direction of the
energy-flux vector is consistent with the prediction of the weak turbulence
theory in the wavenumber range dominated by the inertial waves. However, the
energy flux along the critical wavenumbers predicted by the critical balance in
the buffer range between in the weak turbulence range and the isotropic
Kolmogorov turbulence range is not observed in the present simulations. This
discrepancy between the critical balance and the present numerical results is
discussed and the dissipation is found to play an important role in the energy

on progressive HIV testing scale-up and earlier treatment, a reduction in the
estimated number of new infections in men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) in
England had yet to be identified by 2010. To achieve internationally agreed
targets for HIV control and elimination, test-and-treat prevention efforts have
been dramatically intensified over the period 2010-2015, and, from 2016,
further strengthened by pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
  Methods: Application of a novel age-stratified back-calculation approach to
data on new HIV diagnoses and CD4 count-at-diagnosis, enabled age-specific
estimation of HIV incidence, undiagnosed infections and mean time-to-diagnosis
across both the 2010-2015 and 2016-2018 periods. Estimated incidence trends
were then extrapolated, to quantify the likelihood of achieving HIV elimination
by 2030.
  Findings: A fall in HIV incidence in MSM is estimated to have started in
2012/3, eighteen months before the observed fall in new diagnoses. A steep
decrease from 2,770 annual infections (95% credible interval 2.490-3,040) in
2013 to 1,740 (1,500-2,010) in 2015 is estimated, followed by steady decline
from 2016, reaching 854 (441-1,540) infections in 2018. A decline is
consistently estimated in all age groups, with a fall particularly marked in
the 24-35 age group, and slowest in the 45+ group. Comparable declines are
estimated in the number of undiagnosed infections.
  Interpretation: The peak and subsequent sharp decline in HIV incidence
occurred prior to the phase-in of PrEP. Definining elimination as a public
health threat to be < 50 new infections (1.1 infections per 10,000 at risk),
40% of incidence projections hit this threshold by 2030. In practice, targeted
policies will be required, particularly among the 45+y where STIs are
increasing most rapidly.

processes with immigration are present, we study the relative frequency of one
of them when the total mass is forced to be constant at a dense set of times.
This leads to a SDE whose unique strong solution will be the definition of a
$\Lambda$-asymmetric frequency process ($\Lambda$-AFP). We prove that it is a
Feller process and we calculate a large population limit when the total mass
tends to infinity. This allows us to study the fluctuations of the process
around its deterministic limit. Furthermore, we find conditions for the
$\Lambda$-AFP to have a moment dual. The dual can be interpreted in terms of
selection, (coordinated) mutation, pairwise branching (efficiency),
coalescence, and a novel component that comes from the asymmetry between the
reproduction mechanisms. In the particular case of a pair of equally
distributed continuous-state branching processes, the associated $\Lambda$-AFP
will be the dual of a $\Lambda$-coalescent. The map that sends each
continuous-state branching process to its associated $\Lambda$-coalescent
(according to the former procedure) is a homeomorphism between metric spaces.

Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics (CPMD) simulation was used to identify which
H$_2$O and O$_2$ molecules surrounding the DNA-molecule were converted into
reactive oxygen species (ROS). Subsequently, the femto- to nano-second
reactions of ROS were simulated by using MD with Reactive Force Field (ReaxFF),
to illustrate ROS merging into new types of non-reactive oxygen species (NROS)
due to strong coupling among ROS. Time-dependent molecular simulations revealed
the formation of metastable and transient spaghetti-like complexes among ROS
generated at UHDR. At the higher ROS densities produced under UHDR, stranded
chains (i.e., NROS) are produced, mediated through attractive electric polarity
forces, hydrogen bonds, and magnetic dipole-dipole interactions among hydroxyl

as opposed to the isolated and sparsely dense ROS generated at conventional
dose rates (CDR). We attribute this effect to the suppression of bio-molecular

recognize. Prior research has shown the potential security vulnerabilities when
communities are not filtered. This work sheds light on a second unintended
side-effect of communities and permissive propagation: an increase in
unnecessary BGP routing messages. Due to its transitive property, a change in
the community attribute induces update messages throughout established routes,
just updating communities. We ground our work by characterizing the handling of
updates with communities, including when filtered, on multiple real-world BGP
implementations in controlled laboratory experiments. We then examine 10 years
of BGP messages observed in the wild at two route collector systems. In 2020,
approximately 25% of all announcements modify the community attribute, but
retain the AS path of the most recent announcement; an additional 25% update
neither community nor AS path. Using predictable beacon prefixes, we
demonstrate that communities lead to an increase in update messages both at the

This effect is prominent for geolocation communities during path exploration:

  https://github.com/kpdonahue/model_sharing_games",,,,"cs.GT cs.CY cs.DC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Federated learning is a setting where agents, each with access to their own
data source, combine models from local data to create a global model. If agents
are drawing their data from different distributions, though, federated learning
might produce a biased global model that is not optimal for each agent. This
means that agents face a fundamental question: should they choose the global
model or their local model? We show how this situation can be naturally
analyzed through the framework of coalitional game theory.
  We propose the following game: there are heterogeneous players with different
model parameters governing their data distribution and different amounts of
data they have noisily drawn from their own distribution. Each player's goal is
to obtain a model with minimal expected mean squared error (MSE) on their own
distribution. They have a choice of fitting a model based solely on their own
data, or combining their learned parameters with those of some subset of the
other players. Combining models reduces the variance component of their error
through access to more data, but increases the bias because of the
heterogeneity of distributions.
  Here, we derive exact expected MSE values for problems in linear regression
and mean estimation. We then analyze the resulting game in the framework of
hedonic game theory; we study how players might divide into coalitions, where
each set of players within a coalition jointly construct model(s). We analyze
three methods of federation, modeling differing degrees of customization. In
uniform federation, the agents collectively produce a single model. In
coarse-grained federation, each agent can weight the global model together with
their local model. In fine-grained federation, each agent can flexibly combine
models from all other agents in the federation. For each method, we analyze the
stable partitions of players into coalitions.

gravitational waves will efficiently remove energy and angular momentum from
the binary orbit, allowing the separation between the compact objects to
shrink. In the scenario where a circumprimary disc is present, a squeezing
phase will develop, in which the tidal interaction between the disc and the
secondary black hole could push the gas inwards, enhancing the accretion rate
on to the primary and producing what is known as an electromagnetic precursor.
In this context, using 3D hydrodynamic simulations, we study how an adiabatic
circumprimary accretion disc responds to the varying gravitational potential as
the secondary falls onto the more massive object. We included a cooling
prescription controlled by the parameter \beta = \Omega t_{cool}, which will
determine how strong the final accretion rate is: a hotter disc is thicker, and
the tidal interaction is suppressed for the gas outside the binary plane. Our
main results are that for scenarios where the gas cannot cool fast enough
(\beta>30) the disc becomes thick and renders the system invisible, while for
\beta<10 the strong cooling blocks any leakage on to the secondary's orbit,
allowing an enhancement in the accretion rate two orders of magnitude stronger
than the average through the rest of the simulation.

ground truth errors in label semantics (assuming label locations to be correct)

revealed that ""molecular noise"" - intrinsic stochasticity at the molecular
scale - leads to significant deviations from classical results and to
unexpected effects like ""molecular memory"", i.e., the breakdown of statistical
independence between turnover events. Here we show, through a new method of
analysis, that memory and non-hyperbolicity have a common source in an initial,
and observably long, transient peculiar to stochastic reaction networks of
multiple enzymes. Networks of single enzymes do not admit such transients. The
transient yields, asymptotically, to a steady-state in which memory vanishes

observed molecular memory in a single enzyme with multiple binding sites. Our

such as English, may require us to capture more refined semantics for use in
time-specific or location-aware situations, such as the study of cultural
trends or language use. However, popular vector representations for words do
not adequately include temporal or spatial information. In this work, we
present a model for learning word representation conditioned on time and
location. In addition to capturing meaning changes over time and location, we
require that the resulting word embeddings retain salient semantic and
geometric properties. We train our model on time- and location-stamped corpora,
and show using both quantitative and qualitative evaluations that it can
capture semantics across time and locations. We note that our model compares
favorably with the state-of-the-art for time-specific embedding, and serves as
a new benchmark for location-specific embeddings.

samples and generalize these concepts to different situations. Even though
today's machine learning models excel with a plethora of training data on
standard recognition tasks, a considerable gap exists between machine-level
pattern recognition and human-level concept learning. To narrow this gap, the
Bongard problems (BPs) were introduced as an inspirational challenge for visual
cognition in intelligent systems. Despite new advances in representation
learning and learning to learn, BPs remain a daunting challenge for modern AI.
Inspired by the original one hundred BPs, we propose a new benchmark
Bongard-LOGO for human-level concept learning and reasoning. We develop a
program-guided generation technique to produce a large set of
human-interpretable visual cognition problems in action-oriented LOGO language.
Our benchmark captures three core properties of human cognition: 1)
context-dependent perception, in which the same object may have disparate
interpretations given different contexts; 2) analogy-making perception, in
which some meaningful concepts are traded off for other meaningful concepts;
and 3) perception with a few samples but infinite vocabulary. In experiments,
we show that the state-of-the-art deep learning methods perform substantially
worse than human subjects, implying that they fail to capture core human
cognition properties. Finally, we discuss research directions towards a general
architecture for visual reasoning to tackle this benchmark.

the emergence of edge modes, a phenomenon known as bulk-edge correspondence,

are widely presented as signatures of non-trivial topology, how bulk wave
functions can manifest explicitly topological properties remains unresolved.

of the degenerate phononic wave function yields a non-trivial phonon dynamical

excellent agreement with numerical and model calculations. Our results
establish IXS as a powerful tool to uncover topological wave functions,
providing a key missing ingredient in the study of topological quantum matter.

The root
of the difficulty is that high-level structures, such as instruction and

heuristics or simple pattern matching to approximate the recovery, but these
methods are often inaccurate and brittle, especially across different compiler
optimizations.
  We present XDA, a transfer-learning-based disassembly framework that learns
different contextual dependencies present in machine code and transfers this
knowledge for accurate and robust disassembly. We design a self-supervised
learning task motivated by masked Language Modeling to learn interactions among
byte sequences in binaries. The outputs from this task are byte embeddings that
encode sophisticated contextual dependencies between input binaries' byte
tokens, which can then be finetuned for downstream disassembly tasks.
  We evaluate XDA's performance on two disassembly tasks, recovering function
boundaries and assembly instructions, on a collection of 3,121 binaries taken
from SPEC CPU2017, SPEC CPU2006, and the BAP corpus. The binaries are compiled
by GCC, ICC, and MSVC on x86/x64 Windows and Linux platforms over 4
optimization levels. XDA achieves 99.0% and 99.7% F1 score at recovering

integrated within two time-gates (the delayed part and the entire digitized
waveform). For a satisfactory PSD performance, a setup should generate many
photoelectrons (p.e.) and collect their charges efficiently. The PMT setup
generates more p.e. than the MPPC setup does. With the same digitizer and the

times the length when using the previous digitizer. With this longer time-gate,
we collect more p.e. at the tail part of the pulse and almost all the charges

improved significantly. This study also provides an estimation of the short

characterized by master-slave machines, which are Turing machine like devices.
The proof of the characterization gives a normal form theorem in the style of
Kleene. Furthermore, this characterization is a natural combination of two most
influential theories of computation over real numbers, namely, the type-two
theory of effectivity (TTE) (see, for example, Weihrauch) and the
Blum-Shub-Smale model of computation (BSS). Under this notion of computability,
the recursive (or computable) subsets of real numbers are exactly effective

Meanwhile, we adopt the dense connections to take advantage of both low- and

the multiple-resolution features in parallel paths to combine the benefits of
the features with different resolutions, i.e., the high-resolution feature

Hour-of-the-week is multiple-order-up, because it passes over day-of-the-week.
Methods are provided for creating all possible granularities for a time index.
A recommendation algorithm provides an indication whether a pair of
granularities can be meaningfully examined together (a ""harmony""), or when they

  Time granularities can be used to create data visualizations to explore for
periodicities, associations and anomalies. The granularities form categorical

noise that makes the system randomly change between spinning and standing

most of the trajectories follow straight lines with an approximately constant

ranging success probability is the probability that a multiple radar system
successfully detects an object at a given range, under certain operating
conditions. In state-of-the-art literature, closed form expressions for ranging
success probability have been derived assuming no fading in desired signal
component. Similarly in literature, though distribution of fading in
interferers is assumed to be arbitrary, closed form expression is derived only
for no-fading assumption in interferers. As fading is always present in a
wireless channel, we have derived ranging success probability assuming desired
channel experiences the popular Rayleigh fading. And we have assumed
generalized $\kappa$-$\mu$ shadowed fading for interfering channels that
generalizes many popular fading models such as Rayleigh, Rician, Nakagami-$m$,

activities to a group of users in people's daily social life. The major
challenge in this task is how to aggregate personal preferences of group
members to infer the decision of a group. Conventional group recommendation
methods applied a predefined strategy for preference aggregation. However,
these static strategies are too simple to model the real and complex process of
group decision-making, especially for occasional groups which are formed
ad-hoc. Moreover, group members should have non-uniform influences or weights
in a group, and the weight of a user can be varied in different groups.
Therefore, an ideal group recommender system should be able to accurately learn
not only users' personal preferences but also the preference aggregation
strategy from data. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end group
recommender system named CAGR (short for Centrality Aware Group Recommender""),
which takes Bipartite Graph Embedding Model (BGEM), the self-attention
mechanism and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) as basic building blocks to
learn group and user representations in a unified way. Specifically, we first
extend BGEM to model group-item interactions, and then in order to overcome the
limitation and sparsity of the interaction data generated by occasional groups,
we propose a self-attentive mechanism to represent groups based on the group
members. In addition, to overcome the sparsity issue of user-item interaction
data, we leverage the user social networks to enhance user representation
learning, obtaining centrality-aware user representations. We create three
large-scale benchmark datasets and conduct extensive experiments on them. The
experimental results show the superiority of our proposed CAGR by comparing it
with state-of-the-art group recommender models.

Furthermore, the energy in high-order even modes (l,m $\geq$ 2) is similar to
average triaxial halos found in cosmological simulations. As such, the response
of the MW's halo to the LMC must be accounted for in order to recover the
imprints of its assembly history. The LMC causes the outer halo ($\geq$ 30 kpc)
to shift from the disk center of mass (COM) by $\sim$15-25 kpc at present day,
manifesting as a dipole in the BFE and in the radial velocities of halo stars.
The shift depends on the LMC's infall mass, the distortion of the LMC's halo
and the MW halo response. Within 30 kpc, halo tracers are expected to orbit the
COM of the MW's disk, regardless of LMC infall mass. The LMC's halo is also

extend the Lambek calculus ($\mathrm{L}$) and grammars based on it to graphs.
The resulting approach is called hypergraph Lambek calculus ($\mathrm{HL}$). It
is a logical sequential calculus whose sequents are graphs; it naturally
extends the Lambek calculus and also allows one to embed its variants

However, while Lambek grammars are equivalent to context-free grammars in the
string case, hypergraph Lambek grammars are much more powerful than hyperedge
replacement grammars. Particularly, the former can generate the language of all
graphs without isolated nodes; the language of all bipartite graphs; finite
intersections of languages generated by hyperedge replacement grammars.
Nevertheless, the derivability problem in $\mathrm{HL}$ and the membership
problem for grammars based on $\mathrm{HL}$ are NP-complete as well as the

learn a low-dimensional shape representation from the given task, instead of
relying on hand-engineered representations. Our framework is modular and
consists of several computing blocks that perform fundamental shape processing
tasks. The networks operate on unordered point clouds and provide invariance to
similarity transformations, avoiding the need to identify point correspondences
between shapes. Based on the framework, we assemble a discriminative model for
disease classification and age regression, as well as a generative model for
the accruate reconstruction of shapes. In particular, we propose a conditional
generative model, where the condition vector provides a mechanism to control
the generative process. instance, it enables to assess shape variations
specific to a particular diagnosis, when passing it as side information. Next
to working on single shapes, we introduce an extension for the joint analysis
of multiple anatomical structures, where the simultaneous modeling of multiple
structures can lead to a more compact encoding and a better understanding of
disorders. We demonstrate the advantages of our framework in comprehensive
experiments on real and synthetic data. The key insights are that (i) learning
a shape representation specific to the given task yields higher performance
than alternative shape descriptors, (ii) multi-structure analysis is both more
efficient and more accurate than single-structure analysis, and (iii) point
clouds generated by our model capture morphological differences associated to
Alzheimers disease, to the point that they can be used to train a
discriminative model for disease classification. Our framework naturally scales

of the intriguing and challenging problems in physics. Theory has predicted
that the ferromagnetic order can coexist with the superconducting order in the
form of a spontaneous vortex phase in which magnetic vortices nucleate in the
absence of an external field. However, there has been no rigorous demonstration
of spontaneous vortices by bulk magnetic measurements. Here we show the results
of experimental observations of spontaneous vortices using a
superconductor/ferromagnet fractal nanocomposite, in which superconducting MgB2
and ferromagnetic nanograins are dispersedly embedded in the normal matrix to
realize the remote electromagnetic interaction and also to induce a long-range
Josephson coupling. We found from bulk magnetization measurements that the
sample with nonzero remanent magnetization exhibits the magnetic behaviors
which are fully consistent with a spontaneous vortex scenario predicted
theoretically for magnetic inclusions in a superconducting material. The
resulting spontaneous vortex state is in equilibrium and coexists surprisingly
with a Meissner state (complete shielding of an external magnetic field). The
present observation not only reveals the evolution process of the spontaneous
vortices in superconductor/ferromagnet hybrids, but it also sheds light on the
role of the fractal disorder and structural heterogeneity on the vortex
nucleation under the influence of Josephson superconducting currents.

extrapolation techniques are used to estimate the equilibrium state from

spanning a wide range of temporal scales - it is hard to extract long-term

model that, unlike the conventional IRS model, takes into account the impact of
the incident and reflection angles of the impinging electromagnetic wave on the
reflected signal. To facilitate efficient resource allocation design for large
IRSs, we employ a scalable optimization framework, where the IRS is partitioned
into several tiles and the phase shift elements of each tile are jointly
designed to realize different transmission modes. Then, the beamforming vectors
at the base station (BS) and the transmission mode selection of the tiles of
the IRS are jointly optimized for minimization of the BS transmit power taking
into account the quality-of-service requirements of both non-linear energy
harvesting receivers and information decoding receivers. For handling the
resulting non-convex optimization problem, we apply a penalty-based method,
successive convex approximation, and semidefinite relaxation to develop a
computationally efficient algorithm which asymptotically converges to a locally
optimal solution of the considered problem. Our simulation results show that
the proposed scheme enables considerable power savings compared to two baseline
schemes. Moreover, our results also illustrate that the advocated physics-based

concept of multidimensional IM by various combinations of one-dimensional IM
techniques to provide higher spectral efficiency (SE) and better bit error rate
(BER) performance at the expense of higher transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx)
complexity. Despite the ongoing research on the design of new IM techniques and
their implementation challenges, proper use of the available IM techniques to
address different requirements of 5G and beyond networks is an open research
area in the literature. For this reason, we first provide the dimensional-based
categorization of available IM domains and review the existing IM types
regarding this categorization. Then, we develop a framework that investigates
the efficient utilization of these techniques and establishes a link between
the IM schemes and 5G services, namely enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB),
massive machine-type communications (mMTC), and ultra-reliable low-latency
communication (URLLC). Additionally, this work defines key performance
indicators (KPIs) to quantify the advantages and disadvantages of IM techniques
in time, frequency, space, and code dimensions. Finally, future recommendations
are given regarding the design of flexible IM-based communication systems for
5G and beyond wireless networks.

channels (DM-BCs) with private messages, where the transmitter wishes to convey
$K$ private messages to $K$ receivers respectively. A general inner bound on
the capacity region is proposed based on an exhaustive message splitting and a
$K$-level modified Marton's coding. The key idea is to split every message into
$ \sum_{j=1}^K {K\choose j} $ submessages each corresponding to a set of users
who are assigned to recover them, and then send these submessages through
codewords that are jointly typical with each other. To guarantee the joint
typicality among all transmitted codewords, a sufficient condition on the
subcodebooks sizes is derived through a newly establishing hierarchical
covering lemma, which extends the 2-level multivariate covering lemma to the
$K$-level case including $(2^{K}-1)$ random variables with more intricate
dependence. As the number of auxiliary random variables and rate constraints
both increase linearly with $(2^{K}-1)$, the standard Fourier-Motzkin
elimination procedure becomes infeasible when $K$ is large. To tackle this
problem, we obtain the final form of achievable rate region with a special
observation of disjoint unions of sets that constitute the power set of $
\{1,\dots,K\}$. The proposed achievable rate region allows arbitrary input
probability mass functions (pmfs) and improves over all previously known ones
for $ K$-receiver ($K\geq 3$) BCs whose input pmfs should satisfy certain
Markov chain(s).

In this paper, using diffusion operators, we extend a temporal SIT model,

model. Adapting some theoretical results on traveling wave solutions for
partially degenerate reaction-diffusion equations, we show the existence of
mono-stable and bi-stable traveling-wave solutions for our SIT system. The
dynamics of our system is driven by a SIT-threshold number above which the SIT
control becomes effective and drives the system to elimination, using massive
releases. When the amount of sterile males is lower than the SIT-threshold, the
SIT model experiences a strong Allee effect such that a bi-stable traveling
wave solution can exist and can also be used to derive an effective long term
strategy, mixing massive and small releases. We illustrate some of our
theoretical results with numerical simulations , and, also explore numerically
spatial-localized SIT control strategies, using massive and small releases. We
show that this ""corridor"" strategy can be efficient to block an invasion and
eventually can be used to push back the front of a vector/pest invasion.

sharp contrast to the case of MoS2 homobilayer, here the energy band gap
reduces with increasing twist angle. We find a remarkable interlayer charge
transfer from MoTe2 to MoS2 which enlarges the band gap, but this charge
transfer weakens with greater twisting and interlayer overlapping degree. Our
discovery provides a solid basis in twistronics and practical instruction in
band structure engineering of van der Waals heterostructures.

confirmed that some NGD methods with approximate Fisher information converge
sufficiently fast in practice. Nevertheless, it remains unclear from the
theoretical perspective why and under what conditions such heuristic
approximations work well. In this work, we reveal that, under specific
conditions, NGD with approximate Fisher information achieves the same fast
convergence to global minima as exact NGD. We consider deep neural networks in
the infinite-width limit, and analyze the asymptotic training dynamics of NGD
in function space via the neural tangent kernel. In the function space, the
training dynamics with the approximate Fisher information are identical to
those with the exact Fisher information, and they converge quickly. The fast
convergence holds in layer-wise approximations; for instance, in block diagonal
approximation where each block corresponds to a layer as well as in block
tri-diagonal and K-FAC approximations. We also find that a unit-wise
approximation achieves the same fast convergence under some assumptions. All of
these different approximations have an isotropic gradient in the function
space, and this plays a fundamental role in achieving the same convergence
properties in training. Thus, the current study gives a novel and unified
theoretical foundation with which to understand NGD methods in deep learning.

of large-scale finite cell problems on both uniform grids and multi-level

the basis functions utilized in the finite cell method and the multi-level
hp-method, which is attributed to the use of high-order integrated Legendre
basis functions and overlay meshes, to yield a simple and elegant multigrid
scheme. This simplicity is reflected in the fact that all restriction and
prolongation operators reduce to binary matrices that do not need to be
explicitly constructed. The coarse spaces are constructed over the different
polynomial orders and refinement levels of the immersed discretization.
Elementwise and patchwise additive Schwarz smoothing techniques are used to
mitigate the influence of the cut cells leading to convergence rates that are
independent of the cut configuration, mesh size and in certain scenarios even
the polynomial order. The multigrid approach is applied to second-order
problems arising from the Poisson equation and linear elasticity. A series of
numerical examples demonstrate the applicability of the scheme for solving
large immersed systems with multiple millions and even billions of unknowns on
massively parallel machines.

well in remote sensing images (RSIs) scene classification. However, supervised
learning requires a huge number of annotated data for training. When labeled
samples are not sufficient, the most common solution is to fine-tune the
pre-training models using a large natural image dataset (e.g. ImageNet).
However, this learning paradigm is not a panacea, especially when the target
remote sensing images (e.g. multispectral and hyperspectral data) have
different imaging mechanisms from RGB natural images. To solve this problem, we
introduce new self-supervised learning (SSL) mechanism to obtain the
high-performance pre-training model for RSIs scene classification from large
unlabeled data. Experiments on three commonly used RSIs scene classification
datasets demonstrated that this new learning paradigm outperforms the
traditional dominant ImageNet pre-trained model. Moreover, we analyze the
impacts of several factors in SSL on RSIs scene classification tasks, including
the choice of self-supervised signals, the domain difference between the source
and target dataset, and the amount of pre-training data. The insights distilled
from our studies can help to foster the development of SSL in the remote
sensing community. Since SSL could learn from unlabeled massive RSIs which are
extremely easy to obtain, it will be a potentially promising way to alleviate
dependence on labeled samples and thus efficiently solve many problems, such as
global mapping.

closed-loop control and automation processes is one of the main aspects of the
envisioned Industry 4.0. In this regard, a major challenge is to ensure a
robust and stable control system over an unreliable wireless channel. One of
the main use-cases in this context is Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) control in
a future factory. Specifically, we consider a system where an AGV controller is
placed in an edge cloud in the factory network infrastructure and the control
commands are sent over a time-correlated Rayleigh fading channel. In an
industrial control, short packets are exchanged between the controller and the
actuator. Therefore, in this case, Shannon's assumption for an infinite block
length is not applicable. The objective is to analyse the stability performance
of an AGV control system in a Finite Block-Length (FBL) regime. We evaluate the
coding rate required to maintain a stable edge cloud based AGV system. The
results illustrate that adapting the control parameters can lower the stringent
requirements on the coding rate. It reveals that a constant stability
performance can be achieved even at higher coding rate by increasing the AGV's
velocity. Moreover, this paper also determines the maximum number of AGVs that
can be served seamlessly over the available communication resources while
maintaining a stable control system.

combining high-resolution optical and near-IR spectropolarimetry with
long-baseline near-IR interferometry and multicolor photometry. DoAr 44 is a
young 1.2 solar mass star, moderately accreting from its disk, and seen at a
low inclination. We derive a rotational period of 2.96 d from the system's
light curve. Several optical and near-IR line profiles probing the accretion
funnel flows and the accretion shock are modulated at the stellar rotation
period. The most variable line profile, HeI 1083 nm, exhibits modulated
redshifted wings a signature of accretion funnel flows, as well as deep
blueshifted absorptions indicative of transient outflows. The Zeeman-Doppler
analysis suggests the star hosts a mainly dipolar magnetic field, inclined by
about 20 deg. onto the spin axis, with an intensity reaching about 800 G at the
photosphere, and up to 2 +/- 0.8 kG close to the accretion shock. The magnetic
field appears strong enough to disrupt the inner disk close to the corotation
radius, at a distance of about 4.6 stellar radii (0.043 au). This supports the
upper limit of 5 stellar radii (0.047 au) we derived for the size of the
magnetosphere from long baseline interferometry. DoAr 44 is a pre-transitional
disk system, exhibiting a 25-30 au gap in its circumstellar disk, with the
inner and outer disks being misaligned. On a scale of 0.1 au or less, our
results indicate that the system steadily accretes from its inner disk through
its tilted dipolar magnetosphere. We conclude that in spite of a highly
structured outer disk, perhaps the signature of ongoing planetary formation,
the magnetospheric accretion process proceeds unimpeded at the star-disk
interaction level.

local interfacial tension. They exploit the nonlinear coupling of the
convective transport of solute to the resulting Marangoni flows to self-propel.
Such swimming droplets are by nature anti-chemotactic and are repelled by their
own chemical wake or their neighbours. The rebound dynamics resulting from
pairwise droplet interactions was recently analysed in detail for purely
head-on collisions using a specific bispherical approach. Here, we extend this
analysis and propose a reduced model of a generic collision to characterise the
alignment and scattering properties of oblique droplet collisions and their
potential impact on collective droplet dynamics. A systematic alignment of the
droplets' trajectories is observed for symmetric collisions, when the droplets
interact directly, and arises from the finite-time rearrangement of the
droplets' chemical wake during the collision. For more generic collisions,
complex and diverse dynamical regimes are observed, whether the droplets
interact directly or through their chemical wake, resulting in a significant
scattering.

full data augmentation but to try and make it more efficient. We present two
strategies to do so. The first scheme is to pay a particular attention to the
seemingly trivial fixed effects of the model. We show empirically that
re-centering the latent field on the intercept critically improves chain
behavior. We extend this approach to other fixed effects that may interfere
with a coherent spatial field. We propose a simple method that requires no
tuning while remaining affordable thanks to NNGP's sparsity. The second scheme
accelerates the sampling of the random field using Chromatic samplers. This
method makes long sequential simulation boil down to group-parallelized or
group-vectorized sampling. The attractive possibility to parallelize NNGP
likelihood can therefore be carried over to field sampling. We present a R

fundamental for knowledge-intensive tasks such as entity linking and
open-domain question answering. Current approaches can be understood as
classifiers among atomic labels, one for each entity. Their weight vectors are
dense entity representations produced by encoding entity meta information such
as their descriptions. This approach has several shortcomings: (i) context and
entity affinity is mainly captured through a vector dot product, potentially
missing fine-grained interactions; (ii) a large memory footprint is needed to
store dense representations when considering large entity sets; (iii) an
appropriately hard set of negative data has to be subsampled at training time.
In this work, we propose GENRE, the first system that retrieves entities by
generating their unique names, left to right, token-by-token in an
autoregressive fashion. This mitigates the aforementioned technical issues
since: (i) the autoregressive formulation directly captures relations between
context and entity name, effectively cross encoding both; (ii) the memory
footprint is greatly reduced because the parameters of our encoder-decoder
architecture scale with vocabulary size, not entity count; (iii) the softmax
loss is computed without subsampling negative data. We experiment with more
than 20 datasets on entity disambiguation, end-to-end entity linking and
document retrieval tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art or very competitive
results while using a tiny fraction of the memory footprint of competing

""continual learning"" setting to expand its knowledge to new domains or
functionalities incrementally. The major challenge towards this goal is
catastrophic forgetting, meaning that a continually trained model tends to
forget the knowledge it has learned before. To this end, we propose a method
called ARPER (Adaptively Regularized Prioritized Exemplar Replay) by replaying
prioritized historical exemplars, together with an adaptive regularization
technique based on ElasticWeight Consolidation. Extensive experiments to
continually learn new domains and intents are conducted on MultiWoZ-2.0 to
benchmark ARPER with a wide range of techniques. Empirical results demonstrate
that ARPER significantly outperforms other methods by effectively mitigating
the detrimental catastrophic forgetting issue.

multi-core scalability and performance by having operations traverse the data
structure without any synchronization. As a result, however, these algorithms
are notoriously difficult to prove linearizable, which requires identifying a
point in time in which the traversal's result is correct. The problem is that
traversing the data structure as it undergoes modifications leads to complex
behaviors, necessitating intricate reasoning about all interleavings of reads
by traversals and writes mutating the data structure.
  In this paper, we present a general proof technique for proving
unsynchronized traversals correct in a significantly simpler manner, compared
to typical concurrent reasoning and prior proof techniques. Our framework
relies only on sequential properties} of traversals and on a conceptually
simple and widely-applicable condition about the ways an algorithm's writes
mutate the data structure. Establishing that a target data structure satisfies
our condition requires only simple concurrent reasoning, without considering
interactions of writes and reads. This reasoning can be further simplified by
using our framework.
  To demonstrate our technique, we apply it to prove several interesting and
challenging concurrent binary search trees: the logical-ordering AVL tree, the
Citrus tree, and the full contention-friendly tree. Both the logical-ordering
tree and the full contention-friendly tree are beyond the reach of previous
approaches targeted at simplifying linearizability proofs.

model parameters in a multi-agent system with data locally processed via
distributed edge nodes. A class of mini-batch stochastic alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithms is explored to develop the distributed

differential equations (SDEs) with a drift coefficient that has discontinuities
in space has begun. In the majority of these results it is assumed that the
drift coefficient satisfies piecewise regularity conditions and that the
diffusion coefficient is globally Lipschitz continuous and non-degenerate at
the discontinuities of the drift coefficient. Under this type of assumptions
the best $L_p$-error rate obtained so far for approximation of scalar SDEs at
the final time is $3/4$ in terms of the number of evaluations of the driving
Brownian motion. In the present article we prove for the first time in the
literature sharp lower error bounds for such SDEs. We show that for a huge
class of additive noise driven SDEs of this type the $L_p$-error rate $3/4$ can
not be improved.
  For the proof of this result we employ a novel technique by studying
equations with coupled noise: we reduce the analysis of the $L_p$-error of an
arbitrary approximation based on evaluation of the driving Brownian motion at
finitely many times to the analysis of the $L_p$-distance of two solutions of
the same equation that are driven by Brownian motions that are coupled at the
given time-points and independent, conditioned on their values at these points.
To obtain lower bounds for the latter quantity, we prove a new quantitative
version of positive association for bivariate normal random variables $(Y,Z)$
by providing explict lower bounds for the covariance $\text{Cov}(f(Y),g(Z))$ in
case of piecewise Lipschitz continuous functions $f$ and $g$. In addition it
turns out that our proof technique also leads to lower error bounds for
estimating occupation time functionals $\int_0^1 f(W_t)\, dt$ of a Brownian
motion $W$, which substantially extends known results for the case of $f$ being
an indicator function.

is to privately identify all the current heavy-hitters. That is, on time step
$i$, the goal is to identify all data elements $x$ such that many of the users
have $x$ as their current input. We present an algorithm for this problem with
improved error guarantees over what can be obtained using existing techniques.
Specifically, the error of our algorithm depends on the maximal number of times
that a single user holds a heavy-hitter as input, rather than the total number
of times in which a heavy-hitter exists.

medium (ISM), the star formation time-scale ($\tau_\mathrm{SF}$), and the
interstellar radiation field intensity normalized to the Milky Way value ($U$)
are the main parameters. We find that the SED shape generally has weak
mid-infrared (MIR) emission in the early phase of galaxy evolution because the
dust abundance is dominated by large grains. At an intermediate stage ($t\sim
1$ Gyr for $\tau_\mathrm{SF}=5$ Gyr), the MIR emission grows rapidly because
the abundance of small grains increases drastically by the accretion of
gas-phase metals. We also compare our results with observational data of nearby
and high-redshift ($z\sim 2$) galaxies taken by \textit{Spitzer}. We broadly
reproduce the flux ratios in various bands as a function of metallicity. We
find that small $\eta_\mathrm{dense}$ (i.e.\ the ISM dominated by the diffuse
phase) is favoured to reproduce the 8 $\mu$m intensity dominated by PAHs both
for the nearby and the $z\sim 2$ samples. A long $\tau_\mathrm{SF}$ raises the
8 $\mu$m emission to a level consistent with the nearby low-metallicity
galaxies. The broad match between the theoretical calculations and the

importance of the diffuse ISM for the PAH emission implies the necessity of

signal-to-clutter ratios (SCR) is very important for infrared search and
tracking systems. In this paper, we establish a detection method derived from
maximal entropy random walk (MERW) to robustly detect multiple small targets.
Initially, we introduce the primal MERW and analyze the feasibility of applying
it to small target detection. However, the original weight matrix of the MERW
is sensitive to interferences. Therefore, a specific weight matrix is designed
for the MERW in principle of enhancing characteristics of small targets and
suppressing strong clutters. Moreover, the primal MERW has a critical
limitation of strong bias to the most salient small target. To achieve multiple
small targets detection, we develop a hierarchical version of the MERW method.
Based on the hierarchical MERW (HMERW), we propose a small target detection
method as follows. First, filtering technique is used to smooth the infrared
image. Second, an output map is obtained by importing the filtered image into
the HMERW. Then, a coefficient map is constructed to fuse the stationary
dirtribution map of the HMERW. Finally, an adaptive threshold is used to
segment multiple small targets from the fusion map. Extensive experiments on
practical data sets demonstrate that the proposed method is superior to the
state-of-the-art methods in terms of target enhancement, background suppression
and multiple small targets detection.

studied with simulations in air. Simulating streamers in background fields of

search trees (BSTs), allowing the efficient exploration of tree-structured
domains. (BSTs are the special case in which the underlying domain is a path.)
Trees on trees have been extensively studied under various guises in computer
science and discrete mathematics.
  Recently Bose, Cardinal, Iacono, Koumoutsos, and Langerman (SODA 2020)
considered adaptive STTs and observed that, apart from notable exceptions, the
machinery developed for BSTs in the past decades does not readily transfer to
STTs. In particular, they asked whether the optimal STT can be efficiently
computed or approximated (by analogy to Knuth's algorithm for optimal BSTs),
and whether natural self-adjusting BSTs such as Splay trees (Sleator, Tarjan,
1983) can be extended to this more general setting.
  We answer both questions affirmatively. First, we show that a $(1 +
\frac{1}{t})$-approximation of an optimal size-$n$ STT for a given search
distribution can be computed in time $O(n^{2t + 1})$ for all integers $t \geq
1$. Second, we identify a broad family of STTs with linear rotation-distance,
allowing the generalization of Splay trees to the STT setting. We show that our
generalized Splay satisfies a static optimality theorem, asymptotically
matching the cost of the optimal STT in an online fashion, i.e. without
knowledge of the search distribution. Our results suggest an extension of the
dynamic optimality conjecture for Splay trees to the broader setting of trees
on trees.

deletions with $m$ edges in the initial version of $G$ and $n = |V|$, we
consider the problem of maintaining all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) in $G$.
  Whilst this problem has been studied in a long line of research [ACM'81,
FOCS'99, FOCS'01, STOC'02, STOC'03, SWAT'04, STOC'13] and the problem of
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate, weighted APSP was solved to near-optimal update
time $\tilde{O}(mn)$ by Bernstein [STOC'13], the problem has mainly been
studied in the context of oblivious adversaries, which assumes that the
adversary fixes the update sequence before the algorithm is started.
  In this paper, we make significant progress on the problem in the setting
where the adversary is adaptive, i.e. can base the update sequence on the
output of the data structure queries. We present three new data structures that
fit different settings:
  We first present a deterministic data structure that maintains exact
distances with total update time $\tilde{O}(n^3)$.
  We also present a deterministic data structure that maintains
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate distance estimates with total update time $\tilde
O(\sqrt{m} n^2/\epsilon)$ which for sparse graphs is $\tilde
O(n^{2+1/2}/\epsilon)$.
  Finally, we present a randomized $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate data structure
which works against an adaptive adversary; its total update time is $\tilde
O(m^{2/3}n^{5/3} + n^{8/3}/(m^{1/3}\epsilon^2))$ which for sparse graphs is
$\tilde O(n^{2+1/3})$.
  Our exact data structure matches the total update time of the best randomized
data structure by Baswana et al. [STOC'02] and maintains the distance matrix in
near-optimal time. Our approximate data structures improve upon the best data
structures against an adaptive adversary which have $\tilde{O}(mn^2)$ total
update time [JACM'81, STOC'03].

extensions of the Standard Model of particle physics. Whereas the weakly
coupled subsector of the latter can be treated within a perturbative setting,
the strongly coupled subsector must be dealt with a non-perturbative approach.
Such an approach is provided by the lattice formulation. Unfortunately a
lattice regularization breaks supersymmetry and consequently the mass
degeneracy within a supermultiplet. In this article we investigate the
properties of $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric SU(3) Yang-Mills theory with a
lattice Wilson Dirac operator with an additional parity mass, similar as in
twisted mass lattice QCD. We show that a special $45^\circ$ twist effectively
moves the mass splitting of the chiral partners. Thus, at finite lattice
spacing both chiral and supersymmetry are enhanced resulting in an improved
continuum extrapolation. Furthermore, we show that for the non-interacting
theory at $45^\circ$ twist discretization errors of order $\mathcal{O}(a)$ are
suppressed, suggesting that the same happens for the interacting theory as
well. As an aside, we demonstrate that the DD$\alpha$AMG multigrid algorithm
accelerates the inversion of the Wilson Dirac operator considerably. On a
$16^3\times 32$ lattice, speed-up factors of up to 20 are reached if commonly
used algorithms are replaced by the DD$\alpha$AMG.

we propose the Multi-Grained Discrimination enhanced Generative Adversarial

vivid details. In addition, two pedestrian generation metrics, named Pose Score

diversity, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies
on the caption-annotated pedestrian dataset, CUHK Person Description Dataset.
The substantial improvement over the various metrics demonstrates the efficacy

belongs to at least $k-2$ triangles of $H$. This notion has been introduced
around ten years ago in social network analysis and security, as a form of
cohesive subgraph that is rich of triangles and less stringent than the clique.
The \emph{trussness} of a graph is the maximum $k$ such that a $k$-truss
exists.
  The problem of computing $k$-trusses has been largely investigated from the
practical and engineering point of view. On the other hand, the theoretical
side of the problem has received much less attention, despite presenting
interesting challenges. The existing methods share a common design, based on
iteratively removing the edge with smallest support, where the support of an
edge is the number of triangles containing it.
  The aim of this paper is studying algorithmic aspects of graph trussness.
While it is possible to show that the time complexity of computing exactly the
graph trussness and that of counting/listing all triangles is inherently the
same, we provide efficient algorithms for estimating its value, under suitable
conditions, with significantly lower complexity than the exact approach. In
particular, we provide a $(1 \pm \epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that is
asymptotically faster than the exact approach, on graphs which contain
$\omega(m \, polylog(n))$ triangles, and has the same running time on graphs
that do not. For the latter case, we also show that it is impossible to obtain
an approximation algorithm with faster running time than the one of the exact
approach when the number of triangles is $O(m)$, unless well known conjectures
on triangle-freeness and Boolean matrix multiplication are false.

due to its efficiency in searching for cell structures. DARTS mainly focuses on
the operation search and derives the cell topology from the operation weights.
However, the operation weights can not indicate the importance of cell topology
and result in poor topology rating correctness. To tackle this, we propose to
Decouple the Operation and Topology Search (DOTS), which decouples the topology
representation from operation weights and makes an explicit topology search.
DOTS is achieved by introducing a topology search space that contains
combinations of candidate edges. The proposed search space directly reflects
the search objective and can be easily extended to support a flexible number of
edges in the searched cell. Existing gradient-based NAS methods can be
incorporated into DOTS for further improvement by the topology search.
Considering that some operations (e.g., Skip-Connection) can affect the
topology, we propose a group operation search scheme to preserve
topology-related operations for a better topology search. The experiments on
CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that DOTS is an effective solution for
differentiable NAS.

$C^{\varphi}(S) := \sum_{a \in [n]}w_a\varphi(|S|_a)$, where $|S|_a = |\{i \in

$\varphi(j) = \min\{j,1\}$. For any such $\varphi$, we provide an efficient

collision and embed it in a 3d realization of multiple bubble collisions,
assuming linear superposition of the velocity and enthalpy. The main advantage
of our method compared to 3d hydrodynamic simulations is that it does not
require to resolve the scale of bubble wall thickness. This makes our
simulations more economical and the only two relevant physical length scales
that enter are the bubble size and the shell thickness (that are in turn
enclosed by the box size and the grid spacing). The reduced costs allow for
extensive parameter studies and we provide a parametrization of the final GW
spectrum as a function of the wall velocity and the fluid kinetic energy.

as the consequence of an atmospheric heat engine, which is driven by the
difference in solar radiative heating between the tropics and the poles. The
resulting motion transports heat, which depletes this differential solar
heating and the associated, large-scale temperature difference. This
interaction between the thermodynamic driver and the resulting dynamics leads
to a maximum in the global mean kinetic energy generation rate of about 1.7 W
m$^{-2}$, which matches rates inferred from observations of about 2.1 - 2.5 W
m$^{-2}$ very well. The second part focuses on the limits of converting the
kinetic energy of the atmosphere into renewable energy. The momentum balance of
the lower atmosphere shows that at large-scales, only a fraction of about 26%
of the kinetic energy can at most be converted to renewable energy, yielding a
typical resource potential of about 0.5 W m$^{-2}$ per surface area. The
apparent discrepancy with much higher yields of small wind farms can be
explained by the spatial scale of about 100 km at which kinetic energy near the
surface is being dissipated and replenished. I close with a discussion of how
these insights are compatible to established meteorological concepts, inform
practical applications, and can set the basis for doing climate science in a
simple, analytical, and transparent way.

e-commerce search engines. As search becomes more personalized, it is necessary
to capture the user interest from rich behavior data. Existing user behavior
modeling algorithms develop different attention mechanisms to emphasize
query-relevant behaviors and suppress irrelevant ones. Despite being
extensively studied, these attentions still suffer from two limitations. First,
conventional attentions mostly limit the attention field only to a single
user's behaviors, which is not suitable in e-commerce where users often hunt
for new demands that are irrelevant to any historical behaviors. Second, these
attentions are usually biased towards frequent behaviors, which is unreasonable
since high frequency does not necessarily indicate great importance. To tackle
the two limitations, we propose a novel attention mechanism, termed Kalman
Filtering Attention (KFAtt), that considers the weighted pooling in attention
as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. By incorporating a priori, KFAtt
resorts to global statistics when few user behaviors are relevant. Moreover, a
frequency capping mechanism is incorporated to correct the bias towards
frequent behaviors. Offline experiments on both benchmark and a 10 billion

KFAtt outperforms all compared state-of-the-arts. KFAtt has been deployed in

(TP) profile of exoplanets is an important step forward for improving planetary
atmosphere models, further enabling one to place the detection of spectral
features and the measurement of atomic and molecular abundances through
transmission and emission spectroscopy on solid ground. Aims. The aim is to
constrain the TP profile of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-9b by fitting synthetic
spectra to the observed H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines and identify why
self-consistent planetary TP models are unable to fit the observations.
Methods. We construct 126 one-dimensional TP profiles varying the lower and
upper atmospheric temperatures, as well as the location and gradient of the
temperature rise. For each TP profile, we compute transmission spectra of the
H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines employing the Cloudy radiative transfer code,
which self-consistently accounts for non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE)
effects. Results. The TP profiles leading to best fit the observations are
characterised by an upper atmospheric temperature of 10000-11000 K and by an
inverted temperature profile at pressures higher than 10$^{-4}$ bar. We find
that the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) leads to
overestimate the level population of excited hydrogen by several orders of
magnitude, and hence to significantly overestimate the strength of the Balmer
lines. The chemical composition of the best fitting models indicate that the
high upper atmospheric temperature is most likely driven by metal
photoionisation and that FeII and FeIII have comparable abundances at pressures
lower than 10$^{-6}$ bar, possibly making the latter detectable. Conclusions.
Modelling the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters requires one to account for
metal photoionisation. [abridged]

$90^\circ$. Using the Lomb-Scargle method, we performed timing analyses and
period searches of our polarimetric and photometric data. We found
statistically significant periodic variability of the normalized Stokes
parameters $q$ and $u$ in all passbands. The most significant period of
variability, $P_\text{Pol} = 13.244 \pm 0.012$ d, is equal to one half of the

far, with the most recent eruption occurring on 2019 August 27 UT. This latest
outburst was followed in detail by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, from
less than a day after the eruption until the nova entered the Sun observing
constraint, with a small number of additional observations after the constraint
ended. The X-ray light-curve shows initial hard shock emission, followed by an
early start of the super-soft source phase around day 8.5, with the soft
emission ceasing by day 26. Together with the peak blackbody temperature of the
super-soft spectrum being ~100 eV, these timings suggest the white dwarf mass
to be high, ~1.3 M_sun. The UV photometric light-curve decays monotonically,
with the decay rate changing a number of times, approximately simultaneously
with variations in the X-ray emission. The UV grism spectra show both line and
continuum emission, with emission lines of N, C, Mg and O being notable. These
UV spectra are best dereddened using an SMC extinction law. Optical spectra
from SMARTS show evidence of interaction between the nova ejecta and wind from
the donor star, as well as the extended atmosphere of the red giant being
flash-ionized by the super-soft X-ray photons. Data from NICER reveal a
transient 83 s quasi-periodic oscillation, with a modulation amplitude of 5 per
cent, adding to the sample of novae which show such short variabilities during
their super-soft phase.

global telecommunication infrastructure. Modeling the radio-links of these
networks and their interaction with existing terrestrial systems is crucial for
the design, planning and scaling of these networks. The 3rd generation
partnership project (3GPP) addressed this by providing guideline for such a
radio-channel model. However, the proposed model lacks a satellite orbit model
and has some inconsistencies in the provided parameters. This is addressed in
this paper. We provide a non-geostationary-satellite model that can be
integrated into geometry-based stochastic channel models (GSCMs) such as
QuaDRiGa. We then use this model to obtain the GSCM parameters from a
simplified environment model and compare the results to the 3GPP parameter-set.
This solves the inconsistencies, but our simplified approach does not consider
many propagation effects. Future work must therefore rely on measurements or
accurate Ray-tracing models to obtain the parameters.

concept called interaction region for the HOI problem. Unlike previous methods,
our approach concentrates on the densely sampled interaction regions across
different scales for each human-object pair, so as to capture the subtle visual
features that is most essential to the interaction. Moreover, in order to
compensate for the detection flaws of a single interaction region, we introduce
a novel voting strategy that makes full use of those overlapped interaction
regions in place of conventional Non-Maximal Suppression (NMS). Extensive

this work we propose a morphomechanical model for the torsion of the heart

spontaneous looping can be modeled as a mechanical instability due to
accumulation of residual stresses induced by the geometrical frustration of

this class of materials and stands out as a current puzzle. Here, our NMR
measurements in the nematic state of mechanically detwinned FeSe reveal that
both the Knight shift and the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T_1 possess an
in-plane anisotropy opposite to that of the iron pnictides LaFeAsO and
BaFe2As2. Using a microscopic electron model that includes spin-orbit coupling,
our calculations show that an opposite quasiparticle weight ratio between the
d_xz and d_yz orbitals leads to an opposite anisotropy of the orbital magnetic
susceptibility, which explains our Knight shift results. We attribute this
property to a different nature of nematic order in the two compounds,
predominantly bond-type in FeSe and onsite ferro-orbital in pnictides. The T_1
anisotropy is found to be inconsistent with existing neutron scattering data in
FeSe, showing that the spin fluctuation spectrum reveals surprises at low

our results reveal that important information is hidden in these anisotropies
and they place stringent constraints on the low-energy spin correlations as
well as on the nature of nematicity in FeSe.

initial guess from a learned model trained on samples generated during an

Additionally, in many cases multiple equally suitable, i.e., multi-modal,

we apply tools from algebraic topology to extract information on the underlying

persistent homology to automatically cluster the dataset of precomputed

approaches for computer vision. By learning to embed two augmented versions of
the same image close to each other and to push the embeddings of different
images apart, one can train highly transferable visual representations. As
revealed by recent studies, heavy data augmentation and large sets of negatives
are both crucial in learning such representations. At the same time, data
mixing strategies either at the image or the feature level improve both
supervised and semi-supervised learning by synthesizing novel examples, forcing
networks to learn more robust features. In this paper, we argue that an
important aspect of contrastive learning, i.e., the effect of hard negatives,
has so far been neglected. To get more meaningful negative samples, current top
contrastive self-supervised learning approaches either substantially increase
the batch sizes, or keep very large memory banks; increasing the memory size,
however, leads to diminishing returns in terms of performance. We therefore
start by delving deeper into a top-performing framework and show evidence that
harder negatives are needed to facilitate better and faster learning. Based on
these observations, and motivated by the success of data mixing, we propose
hard negative mixing strategies at the feature level, that can be computed
on-the-fly with a minimal computational overhead. We exhaustively ablate our
approach on linear classification, object detection and instance segmentation
and show that employing our hard negative mixing procedure improves the quality
of visual representations learned by a state-of-the-art self-supervised

years have seen security research increasingly focus on aviation, identifying
that key wireless links---some of which are used in collision avoidance---are
vulnerable to attack. In this paper, we go one step further to understand
whether an attacker can remotely trigger false collision avoidance alarms.
Primarily considering the next-generation Airborne Collision Avoidance System X
(ACAS X), we adopt a modelling approach to extract attacker constraints from
technical standards before simulating collision avoidance attacks against
standardized ACAS X code. We find that in 44% of cases, an attacker can
successfully trigger a collision avoidance alert which on average results in a
590 ft altitude deviation; when the aircraft is at lower altitudes, this
success rate rises considerably to 79%. Furthermore, we show how our simulation
approach can be used to help defend against attacks by identifying where
attackers are most likely to be successful.

stochastic or random noise type fluctuations in variable sources like Active
Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In recent years, estimates of the PSD have been refined
by improvements in both, the quality of observed lightcurves and modeling them
with simulations. This has aided in quantifying the variability including
evaluating the significance of quasi-periodic oscillations. A central
assumption in making such estimates is that of weak non-stationarity. This is
violated for sources with a power-law PSD index steeper than one as the
integral power diverges. As a consequence, estimates of the flux probability
density function (PDF) and PSD are interlinked. In general, for evaluating
parameters of both properties from lightcurves, one cannot avoid a
multi-dimensional, multi-parameter model which is complex and computationally
expensive, as well as harder to constrain and interpret. However, if we only
wish to compute the PSD index as is often the case, we can use a simpler model.
We explore a bending power-law model instead of a simple power-law as input to
time-series simulations to test the quality of reconstruction. Examining the
longterm variability of the classical blazar Mrk 421, extending to multiple
years as is typical of Fermi-LAT or Swift-BAT lightcurves, we find that a
transition from pink (PSD index one) to white noise at a characteristic
timescale, $t_b \sim 500-1000$ years, comparable to the viscous timescale at
the disk truncation radius, seems to provide a good model for simulations. This
is both a physically motivated as well as a computationally efficient model
that can be used to compute the PSD index.

estimation of homography. Our evaluation of the CNN based methods focuses
particularly on measuring the performance under conditions of significant
noise, illumination shift, and occlusion. We also measure the benefits of
training CNNs to varying degrees of noise. Additionally, we compare the effect
of using color images instead of grayscale images for inputs to CNNs. Finally,
we compare the results against baseline feature-matching based homography
estimation methods using SIFT, SURF, and ORB. We find that CNNs can be trained
to be more robust against noise, but at a small cost to accuracy in the
noiseless case. Additionally, CNNs perform significantly better in conditions
of extreme variance than their feature-matching based counterparts. With regard
to color inputs, we conclude that with no change in the CNN architecture to
take advantage of the additional information in the color planes, the
difference in performance using color inputs or grayscale inputs is negligible.
About the CNNs trained with noise-corrupted inputs, we show that training a CNN
to a specific magnitude of noise leads to a ""Goldilocks Zone"" with regard to
the noise levels where that CNN performs best.

their chemical and radiative signatures reveal the physical conditions in which

necessary to understand the physics of many environments including protostellar
outflows, supernova remnants, and galactic outflows.
  We present an accurate treatment of the self-generated UV radiation in
intermediate velocity, stationary, weakly magnetised, J-type, molecular shocks.
Shock solutions computed with the Paris-Durham shock code are post-processed
using a multi-level accelerated $\Lambda$-iteration radiative transfer
algorithm to compute Ly$\alpha$, Ly$\beta$, and 2-photon continuum emission.
The subsequent impacts on the ionisation and dissociation of key atomic and
molecular species as well as on the heating by the photoelectric effect take
the wavelength dependent cross-sections and the fluid velocity profile into
account. We analyse shock models with velocities $V=25-60$ km/s, propagating in
dense ($n \geq 10^4$ ${\rm cm}^{-3}$), shielded gas.
  Self-absorption traps Ly$\alpha$ photons in a small region in the shock,
though a large fraction escapes into the line wings. We find a critical
velocity $V\sim 30$ km/s above which shocks produce a Ly$\alpha$ photon flux
exceeding that of the standard ISRF. The escaping photons generate a warm slab
(T~100 K) ahead of the shock as well as pre-ionise C and S. These shocks are
traced by bright atomic fine structure (e.g. O and S) and metastable (e.g. O
and C) lines, substantive molecular emission (e.g. H2, OH, and CO), enhanced
column densities of several species (e.g. CH+ and HCO+), as well as a severe
destruction of H2O. As much as 13-21% of the initial kinetic energy of the
shock escapes in Ly$\alpha$ and Ly$\beta$ photons if the dust opacity in the
radiative precursor allows it.

uncertainty in several applications from the physical sciences and engineering,

Carlo (MLQMC) method for approximating the expectation of the minimal
eigenvalue of an elliptic eigenvalue problem with coefficients that are given
as a series expansion of countably-many stochastic parameters. The MLQMC
algorithm is based on a hierarchy of discretisations of the spatial domain and
truncations of the dimension of the stochastic parameter domain. To approximate
the expectations, randomly shifted lattice rules are employed. This paper is
primarily dedicated to giving a rigorous analysis of the error of this
algorithm. A key step in the error analysis requires bounds on the mixed
derivatives of the eigenfunction with respect to both the stochastic and
spatial variables simultaneously. Under stronger smoothness assumptions on the
parametric dependence, our analysis also extends to multilevel higher-order
quasi-Monte Carlo rules. An accompanying paper [Gilbert and Scheichl, 2022],
focusses on practical extensions of the MLQMC algorithm to improve efficiency,

this experimentally observed smooth transition does not require frequently used
a priori assumptions of a continuous distribution of work functions on the
cathode surface. Instead, we find the smooth transition arises as a natural
consequence of the physics of nonuniform thermionic emission from a spatially
heterogeneous cathode surface. We obtain this smooth transition for both J-T

includes 3-D space charge, patch fields (electrostatic potential nonuniformity
on the cathode surface based on local work function values), and Schottky
barrier lowering physics and illustrate that a smooth knee can arise from a

Importantly, we find that the inclusion of patch field effects is crucial for
obtaining accurate J-T and J-V curves, and the further inclusion of Schottky
barrier lowering is needed for accurate J-V curves. This finding, and the

  Resilience",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Motivated by recent interest in federated submodel learning, this work
explores the fundamental problem of privately reading from and writing to a
database comprised of $K$ files (submodels) that are stored across $N$
distributed servers according to an $X$-secure threshold secret sharing scheme.
One after another, various users wish to retrieve their desired file, locally
process the information and then update the file in the distributed database
while keeping the identity of their desired file private from any set of up to
$T$ colluding servers. The availability of servers changes over time, so
elastic dropout resilience is required. The main contribution of this work is
an adaptive scheme, called ACSA-RW, that takes advantage of all currently
available servers to reduce its communication costs, fully updates the database
after each write operation even though the database is only partially
accessible due to server dropouts, and ensures a memoryless operation of the
network in the sense that the storage structure is preserved and future users
may remain oblivious of the past history of server dropouts. The ACSA-RW
construction builds upon CSA codes that were originally introduced for XSTPIR
and have been shown to be natural solutions for secure distributed matrix
multiplication problems. ACSA-RW achieves the desired private read and write
functionality with elastic dropout resilience, matches the best results for
private-read from PIR literature, improves significantly upon available
baselines for private-write, reveals a striking symmetry between upload and
download costs, and exploits redundant storage dimensions to accommodate
arbitrary read and write dropout servers up to certain threshold values. It
also answers in the affirmative an open question by Kairouz et al. by
exploiting synergistic gains from the joint design of private read and write
operations.

pretraining works well, but research has focused on settings with very large
data and compute requirements, while the potential of efficient low-resource

this work, we evaluate against three core challenges for resource efficient

long-tail preservation has been linked to algorithmic fairness and because data
in the tail is limited by definition. To address these challenges, we propose a
data and compute efficient self-supervised, contrastive text encoder,
pretrained on 60MB of `task-internal' text data, and compare it to RoBERTa,
which was pretrained on 160GB of `task-external' text. We find our method

comprehensive analysis of instabilities in arbitrary directions to the
background magnetic field. It clarifies the dominant parameter regime (e.g.,
parallel core electron plasma beta $\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$, core

beam-driven electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic instability, the electron
beam-driven whistler instability, the electromagnetic electron cyclotron
instability, the electron mirror instability, the electron firehose

beam can destabilize electron acoustic/magnetoacoustic waves in the
low-$\beta_{\mathrm{ec\parallel}}$ regime, and whistler waves in the medium-

actor-critic algorithms usually have discounting for both actor and critic,

observed at time $t$ in a trajectory and the critic is a discounted value
function. Practitioners, however, usually ignore the discounting ($\gamma^t$)
for the actor while using a discounted critic. We investigate this mismatch in
two scenarios. In the first scenario, we consider optimizing an undiscounted
objective $(\gamma = 1)$ where $\gamma^t$ disappears naturally $(1^t = 1)$. We
then propose to interpret the discounting in critic in terms of a
bias-variance-representation trade-off and provide supporting empirical

models of the actions that abstractly specify what might happen as a result of
an action, and are tailored for efficiently computing state transitions.
However, executing the planned actions has needed operational models, in which
rich computational control structures and closed-loop online decision-making
are used to specify how to perform an action in a nondeterministic execution
context, react to events and adapt to an unfolding situation. Deliberative
actors, which integrate acting and planning, have typically needed to use both
of these models together -- which causes problems when attempting to develop
the different models, verify their consistency, and smoothly interleave acting
and planning.
  As an alternative, we define and implement an integrated acting and planning
system in which both planning and acting use the same operational models. These
rely on hierarchical task-oriented refinement methods offering rich control
structures. The acting component, called Reactive Acting Engine (RAE), is
inspired by the well-known PRS system. At each decision step, RAE can get
advice from a planner for a near-optimal choice with respect to a utility
function. The anytime planner uses a UCT-like Monte Carlo Tree Search
procedure, called UPOM, whose rollouts are simulations of the actor's
operational models. We also present learning strategies for use with RAE and
UPOM that acquire, from online acting experiences and/or simulated planning
results, a mapping from decision contexts to method instances as well as a
heuristic function to guide UPOM. We demonstrate the asymptotic convergence of
UPOM towards optimal methods in static domains, and show experimentally that
UPOM and the learning strategies significantly improve the acting efficiency
and robustness.

However, current supervised methods require a large amount of pixelwise
annotations to yield accurate results. Labeling is a tedious and time consuming
process that has hampered progress in low altitude UAV applications. This paper
makes an important step towards automatic annotation by introducing SegProp, a
novel iterative flow-based method, with a direct connection to spectral
clustering in space and time, to propagate the semantic labels to frames that
lack human annotations. The labels are further used in semi-supervised learning
scenarios. Motivated by the lack of a large video aerial dataset, we also
introduce Ruralscapes, a new dataset with high resolution (4K) images and
manually-annotated dense labels every 50 frames - the largest of its kind, to
the best of our knowledge. Our novel SegProp automatically annotates the
remaining unlabeled 98% of frames with an accuracy exceeding 90% (F-measure),
significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art label propagation methods.
Moreover, when integrating other methods as modules inside SegProp's iterative
label propagation loop, we achieve a significant boost over the baseline
labels. Finally, we test SegProp in a full semi-supervised setting: we train
several state-of-the-art deep neural networks on the
SegProp-automatically-labeled training frames and test them on completely novel

causing high pressure on the health-system facilities. PCR screening is the
adopted diagnostic testing method for COVID-19 detection. However, PCR is
criticized due its low sensitivity ratios, also, it is time-consuming and
manual complicated process. CT imaging proved its ability to detect the disease
even for asymptotic patients, which make it a trustworthy alternative for PCR.
In addition, the appearance of COVID-19 infections in CT slices, offers high
potential to support in disease evolution monitoring using automated infection
segmentation methods. However, COVID-19 infection areas include high variations
in term of size, shape, contrast and intensity homogeneity, which impose a big
challenge on segmentation process. To address these challenges, this paper
proposed an automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 infection areas
segmentation. The system include different steps to enhance and improve
infection areas appearance in the CT slices so they can be learned efficiently
using the deep network. The system start prepare the region of interest by
segmenting the lung organ, which then undergo edge enhancing diffusion
filtering (EED) to improve the infection areas contrast and intensity
homogeneity. The proposed FCN is implemented using U-net architecture with
modified residual block with concatenation skip connection. The block improves
the learning of gradient values by forwarding the infection area features
through the network. To demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of the
proposed system, it is trained and tested using many 2D CT slices extracted
from diverse datasets from different sources. The proposed system is evaluated
using different measures and achieved dice overlapping score of 0.961 and 0.780
for lung and infection areas segmentation, respectively.

we exploit this interplay between relativistic scattering and self-force theory

further implement these novel PN results in an effective-one-body framework,

how symbolic techniques are utilized in deep learning. To do this, we look at
some of the most popular deep learning frameworks being used today, including
TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and MXNet. While these frameworks greatly differ
from one another, many of them use symbolic techniques, whether it be symbolic
execution, graphs, or programming. We focus this paper on symbolic techniques
because they influence not only how neural networks are built but also the way
in which they are executed.
  Limitations of symbolic techniques have led to efforts in integrating
symbolic and nonsymbolic aspects in deep learning, opening up new possibilities
for symbolic techniques. For example, the Gluon API by Apache MXNet bridges the
gap between imperative programming and symbolic execution through
hybridization. Frameworks such as JANUS attempt to translate imperative
programs into symbolic graphs, while approaches like DeepCheck attempt to use
symbolic execution to analyze and validate imperative neural network programs.
Symbolic analysis has also been paired with concrete execution in a technique
called concolic testing in order to better test deep neural networks. Our study
of these developments exemplifies just a few of the many ways the symbolic
techniques employed by popular frameworks have the opportunity to be altered
and utilized to achieve better performance.

for many technological applications. Due to Brownian motion colloidal particles
have constant collisions with each other which often lead to their aggregation
driven by the long range van der Waals attraction. As a result the colloidal
systems often tend to precipitate. A number of methods have been devised to
minimize the effect of long-range van der Waals attraction between colloidal
particles or to override the influence of the attraction in order to provide
the colloidal stability.In the PhD thesis we investigated the colloidal
stabilization in solutions of free polymers which is commonly referred to as
depletion stabilization. Previous theoretical studies of free-polymer induced
(FPI) stabilization were based on oversimplified models involving uncontrolled
approximations. Even the most basic features of the depletion stabilization
phenomenon were unknown. It was unclear how the PI repulsion depends on the
solution parameters, polymer structure and monomer/surface interactions.The
free polymer chains were modeled as random walks in a self-consistent molecular
field that satisfied to diffusion-like integro-differential equation. As the
molecular field we used the chemical potential that for semi-dilute polymer
solution can be represented as a virial expansion where we took into account
only second and third virial coefficients of the polymer solution. Varying the
parameters like polymer stiffness, polymer length, polymer concentration and
solvent regime (like theta solvent) whether it is for purely repulsive
colloidal surface, adsorbed surface or surface with grafted polymer layer we
were able to enhance the repulsive barrier due to the free polymers between the
particles and therefore found conditions for kinetic stabilization of the

dynamic behavior of system models) in the mathematical and conceptual modeling
of systems. This study is conducted in the context of the claim that software
engineering lacks underpinning scientific theories, both for the software it
produces and the processes by which it does so. The research literature
proposes that information theory can provide such a benefit for software
engineering. We explore the dynamism expressive power of conceptual modeling as
a software engineering tool that can represent physical systems in the Shannon
Weaver communication model (SWCM). Specifically, the modeled source in the SWCM
is a physical phenomenon (a change that can occur in the world, e.g., tossing a
coin) resulting in generating observable events and data of unaddressed
information. The resultant model reflects the feasibility of extending the SWCM
to be applied in conceptual modeling in software engineering.

approximants, in whose alloys rare-earth ions located on icosahedral apices are
coupled with each other via the Ruderman--Kittel--Kasuya--Yosida interaction,
opens an avenue to find novel magnetism originating from the icosahedral
symmetry. Here we investigate classical and quantum magnetic states on an
icosahedral cluster within the Heisenberg interactions of all bonds. Simulated
annealing and numerical diagonalization are performed to obtain the classical
and quantum ground states. We obtain qualitative correspondence of classical
and quantum phase diagrams. Our study gives a good starting point to understand
the various magnetism in not only quasicrystalline approximants but also
quasicrystals.

  Review",,,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background and controlled electromagnetic radiation (EMR) on biological cells
and tissues induces thermal, non-thermal, and dielectric property change. After
EMR interaction with cells/tissues the resulting signal is used for imaging,
bio-molecular response, and photo-biomodulation studies at infrared regime, and
for therapeutic use. We attempt to present a review of current literature with
a focus to present compilation of published experimental results for each
regime viz. microwave (extremely low frequency, ELF to 3 GHz), to cellular
communication frequencies (100 KHz to 300 GHz), millimeter wave (300 GHz- 1
THz), and the infra-red band extending up to 461 THz. A unique graphical
representation of frequency effects and their relevant significance in
detection of direct biological effects, therapeutic applications and
biophysical interpretation is presented. A total of seventy research papers
from peer-reviewed journals were used to compile a mixture of useful
information, all presented in a narrative style. Out of the Journal articles
used for this paper, 63 journal articles were published between 2000 to 2020.
Physical, biological, and therapeutic mechanisms of thermal, non-thermal and
complex dielectric effects of EMR on cells are all explained in relevant
sections of this paper. A broad up to date review for the EMR range KHz-NIR
(kilohertz to near infra-red) is prepared. Published reports indicate that
number of biological cell irradiation impact studies fall off rapidly beyond a
few THz EMR, leading to relatively a smaller number of studies in FIR and NIR
bands covering most of the thermal effects and microthermal effects, and
rotation-vibration effects.

  Algorithm","This manuscript contains a wrong definitions and equations",,,,"cs.NE cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One of the most rising issues in recent machine learning research is
One-Class Classification which considers data set composed of only one class
and outliers. It is more reasonable than traditional Multi-Class Classification
in dealing with some problematic data set or special cases. Generally,
classification accuracy and interpretability for user are considered as
trade-off in OCC methods. Classifier based on Hyper-Rectangle (H-RTGL) is a
sort of classifier that can be a remedy for such trade-off and uses H-RTGL
formulated by conjunction of geometric rules called interval. This interval can
be basis of interpretability since it can be easily understood by user.
However, existing H-RTGL based OCC classifiers have limitations that (i) most
of them cannot reflect density of target class and (ii) that considering
density has primitive interval generation method, and (iii) there exists no
systematic procedure for hyperparameter of H-RTGL based OCC classifier, which
influences classification performance of classifier. Based on these remarks, we
suggest One-Class Hyper-Rectangle Descriptor based on density (1-HRD_d) with
more elaborate interval generation method including parametric and
nonparametric approaches. In addition, we designed Genetic Algorithm (GA) that
consists of chromosome structure and genetic operators for systematic
generation of 1-HRD_d by optimization of hyperparameter. Our work is validated
through a numerical experiment using actual data set with comparison of
existing OCC algorithms along with other H-RTGL based classifiers.

of nudging personal and injunctive norms in decisions that involve a trade-off
between objective equality and efficiency. The first two studies provide
evidence that: (i) nudging the personal norm has a similar effect to nudging
the injunctive norm; (ii) when both norms are nudged towards the same
direction, there is no additive effect; (iii) when the personal norm and the
injunctive norm are nudged towards opposite directions, some people tend to
follow the personal norm, while others tend to follow the injunctive norm.
Study 3 tests whether these two classes of people, those who tend to follow the
injunctive norm and those who tend to follow the personal norm, map onto the
two sub-dimensions of Aquino and Reed's moral identity scale. We find partial
evidence of this hypothesis: people higher in the symbolisation dimension are
weakly more likely to follow the injunctive norm; however, we do not find any
evidence that people higher in the internalisation dimension are more likely to
follow the personal norm.
