recognition models on speech segments from movies, where often actors
intentionally disguise their voice to play a character. We make the following
three contributions: (i) We collect a novel, challenging speaker recognition
dataset called VoxMovies, with speech for 856 identities from almost 4000 movie
clips. VoxMovies contains utterances with varying emotion, accents and
background noise, and therefore comprises an entirely different domain to the
interview-style, emotionally calm utterances in current speaker recognition
datasets such as VoxCeleb; (ii) We provide a number of domain adaptation
evaluation sets, and benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art speaker
recognition models on these evaluation pairs. We demonstrate that both speaker
verification and identification performance drops steeply on this new data,
showing the challenge in transferring models across domains; and finally (iii)
We show that simple domain adaptation paradigms improve performance, but there
is still large room for improvement.

Then we generalize this result to a gradient averaged over batches of size $B$.
In this case, the full batch can be reconstructed if the number of hidden units
exceeds $B$. For a \ac{cnn}, the number of required kernels in convolutional

study the more complicated setup where we have two pushforwards (an ""additive""

structures can be described in terms of bispans (or polynomial diagrams). We
show that there exist $(\infty,2)$-categories of bispans, characterized by a
universal property: they corepresent functors out of $\infty$-categories of
spans where the pullbacks have left adjoints and certain canonical 2-morphisms
(encoding base change and distributivity) are invertible. This gives a
universal way to obtain functors from bispans, which amounts to upgrading
""monoid-like"" structures to ""ring-like"" ones. For example, symmetric monoidal
$\infty$-categories can be described as product-preserving functors from spans
of finite sets, and if the tensor product is compatible with finite coproducts
our universal property gives the canonical semiring structure using the
coproduct and tensor product. More interestingly, we encode the additive and
multiplicative transfers on equivariant spectra as a functor from bispans in
finite $G$-sets, extend the norms for finite \'etale maps in motivic spectra to
a functor from certain bispans in schemes, and make $\mathrm{Perf}(X)$ for $X$

representation backbone that extracts structural information and an amortized
clustering network that naturally handles variable numbers of clusters. Both
components combine into well-defined models of the posterior distribution of
graph communities and are jointly optimized given labeled graphs. At inference

quantifying uncertainty in a principled way. We evaluate several models from

performance to previous methods. As a separate contribution, we extend recent
amortized probabilistic clustering architectures by adding attention modules,

weights) of words and sentences related to each of the labels. Secondly, we
propose to enhance the major deep learning models with a label embedding (LE)
initialisation approach, which learns a dense, continuous vector representation

two middle-aged pulsars, namely, Geminga and PSR B0656+14, by the High Altitude
Water Cherenkov observatory (HAWC). The gamma-ray radiation arise from
relativistic electrons that escape the pulsar wind nebula and diffuse in the
surrounding medium. The diffusion coefficient is found to be significantly
lower than the average value in the Galactic disk. If so, given a typical
transverse velocity of $300-500{\,\rm km /s}$ for a pulsar, its displacement
could be important in shaping the morphology of its gamma-ray halos. Motivated
by this, we study the morphology of pulsar halos considering the proper motion
of pulsar. We define three evolutionary phases of pulsar halo to categorize its
morphological features. The morphology of pulsar halos below 10$\,$TeV is
double peaked or single peaked with an extended tail, which depends on the
electron injection history. Above 10 TeV, the morphology of pulsar halos is
nearly spherical, due to the short cooling timescale ($<50\,$kyr) for tens TeV
electrons. We also quantitatively evaluate the separation between the pulsar
and the center of the gamma-ray halo, as well as the influence of different
assumptions for the pulsar characteristics and the injected electrons. Our
results suggest that the separation between the center of the gamma-ray halo
above 10$\,$TeV and the associated pulsar is usually too small to be observable
by HAWC or LHAASO. Hence, our results provide a useful approach to constrain
the origin of extended sources at very high energies.

via optical fibres between multiple kinds of front-end electronics and the
KINPEX PCIe receiver board located in the readout host PC.
  In recent years a stack of device driver software has been developed to
utilize this hardware for several scenarios of data acquisition. On top of this
driver foundation, several graphical user interfaces (GUIs) have been created.
These GUIs are based on the Qt graphics libraries and are designed in a modular
way: All common functionalities, like generic I/O with the front-ends, handling
of configuration files, and window settings, are treated by a framework class
GosipGUI. In the Qt workspace of such GosipGUI frame, specific sub classes may
implement additional windows dedicated to operate different GOSIP front-end
modules. These readout modules developed by GSI Experiment Electronics
department are for instance FEBEX sampling ADCs, TAMEX FPGA-TDCs, or POLAND
QFWs.
  For each kind of front-end the GUIs allow to monitor specific register
contents, to set up the working configuration, and to interactively change
parameters like sampling thresholds during data acquisition. The latter is
extremely useful when qualifying and tuning the front-ends in the electronics
lab or detector cave. Moreover, some of these GosipGUI implementations have

$T{\overline T}$ type in relativistic and non-relativistic systems.
Deformations by the cross products of energy and momentum currents in
integrable quantum field theories are known to modify the thermodynamic Bethe
ansatz equations by a ""CDD factor"". In turn, CDD factors may be interpreted as
additional, fixed shifts incurred in scattering processes: a finite width added
to the fundamental particles (or, if negative, to the free space between them).
We suggest that this physical effect is a universal way of understanding
$T{\overline T}$ deformations, both in classical and quantum systems. We first
show this in non-relativistic systems, with particle conservation and
translation invariance, using the deformation formed out of the densities and
currents of particles and momentum. This holds at the level of the equations of
motion, and for any interaction potential, integrable or not. We then argue,
and show by similar techniques in free relativistic particle systems, that
$T\overline T$ deformations of relativistic systems produce the equivalent
phenomenon, accounting for length contractions. We also show that, in both the
relativistic and non-relativistic cases, the width of particles is equivalent
to a state-dependent change of metric, where the distance function discounts
the particles' widths, or counts the additional free space. This generalises
and explains the known field-dependent coordinate change describing $T\overline
T$ deformations. The results connect such deformations with generalised
hydrodynamics, where the relations between scattering shifts, widths of
particles and state-dependent changes of metric have been established.

the cotangent bundle, finding that both trajectories coincide when the
Hamiltonian is identified with the squared distance in momentum space.
Moreover, following the natural structure of the cotangent bundle geometry, we
construct the space-time curvature tensor, from which we obtain generalized
Einstein equations. Since the metric is not invariant under momentum
diffeomorphisms (changes of momentum coordinates) we note that, in order to
have a conserved Einstein tensor (in the same sense of general relativity), a
privileged momentum basis appears, a completely new result that cannot be found
in absence of space-time curvature, which settles a long standing ambiguity of
this geometric approach. After that, we consider in an expanding universe the
geodesic motion and the Raychaudhuri's equations, and we show how to construct
vacuum solutions to the Einstein equations. Finally, we make a comment about
the possible phenomenological implications of our framework.

causality, however, the use of causal analysis in machine learning is still in
its early stage. Within a general reinforcement learning setting, we consider
the problem of building a general reinforcement learning agent which uses
experience to construct a causal graph of the environment, and use this graph
to inform its policy. Our approach has three characteristics: First, we learn a
simple, coarse-grained causal graph, in which the variables reflect states at
many time instances, and the interventions happen at the level of policies,
rather than individual actions. Secondly, we use mediation analysis to obtain
an optimization target. By minimizing this target, we define the causal
variables. Thirdly, our approach relies on estimating conditional expectations
rather the familiar expected return from reinforcement learning, and we
therefore apply a generalization of Bellman's equations. We show the method can
learn a plausible causal graph in a grid-world environment, and the agent
obtains an improvement in performance when using the causally informed policy.
To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply causal analysis in a
reinforcement learning setting without strict restrictions on the number of
states. We have observed that mediation analysis provides a promising avenue
for transforming the problem of causal acquisition into one of cost-function
minimization, but importantly one which involves estimating conditional
expectations. This is a new challenge, and we think that causal reinforcement
learning will involve development methods suited for online estimation of such
conditional expectations. Finally, a benefit of our approach is the use of very
simple causal models, which are arguably a more natural model of human causal
understanding.

Using an \emph{ansatz}, based on the solution for the two-dimensional quantum

appropriate to describe intralayer excitons in two-dimensional (2D) materials.
These variational energies are then recalculated with a different

obtained energy curves are compared. Afterwards, we discuss the Wannier-Mott
exciton model, reviewing it briefly before focusing on an application of this
model to obtain both the exciton absorption spectrum and the binding energies

briefly discuss an approximation of the electron-hole interaction in interlayer
excitons as an harmonic potential and the comparison of the obtained results

$G(n,n,m)$ into $R(n,n,p)$ and vice versa with probability tending to $1$. In
particular, in the balanced case $n_1 = n_2$, we show that if $p \gg \log n/n$
and $1 - p \gg \left(\log n/n \right)^{1/4}$, then for some $m \sim pn^2$,
asymptotically almost surely one can embed $G(n,n,m)$ into $R(n,n,p)$, while
for $p \gg \left(\log^{3} n/n\right)^{1/4}$ and $1-p \gg \log n/n$ we have the
opposite embedding. As an extension, we confirm the Kim--Vu Sandwich Conjecture
for degrees growing faster than $(n \log n)^{3/4}$.

certainly create a local vortical flow field which, according to chiral (or

processing. Two main strategies have been widely adopted: in a minimum error
discrimination strategy, the average error probability is minimized; while in
an unambiguous discrimination strategy, an inconclusive decision (abstention)
is allowed to vanish any possibility of errors when a conclusive result is
obtained. In both scenarios, the testing between quantum states are relatively
well-understood, for example, the ultimate limits of the performance are
established decades ago; however, the testing between quantum channels is less
understood. Although the ultimate limit of minimum error discrimination between
channels has been explored recently, the corresponding limit of unambiguous
discrimination is unknown. In this paper, we formulate an approximate
unambiguous discrimination scenario, and derive the ultimate limits of the
performance for both states and channels. In particular, in the channel case,
our lower bound of the inconclusive probability holds for arbitrary adaptive
sensing protocols. For the special class of `teleportation-covariant' channels,
the lower bound is achievable with maximum entangled inputs and no adaptive
strategy is necessary.

Several timely researches have discussed the local and global effects of the
confounding factors on COVID-19 casualties in the US. However, most of these
studies considered little about the time varying associations between and among
these factors, which are crucial for understanding the outbreak of the present
pandemic. Therefore, this study adopts various relevant approaches, including
local and global spatial regression models and machine learning to explore the
causal effects of the confounding factors on COVID-19 counts in the contiguous
US. Totally five spatial regression models, spatial lag model (SLM), ordinary
least square (OLS), spatial error model (SEM), geographically weighted
regression (GWR) and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR), are
performed at the county scale to take into account the scale effects on
modelling. For COVID-19 cases, ethnicity, crime, and income factors are found
to be the strongest covariates and explain the maximum model variances. For
COVID-19 deaths, both (domestic and international) migration and income factors
play a crucial role in explaining spatial differences of COVID-19 death counts
across counties. The local coefficient of determination (R2) values derived
from the GWR and MGWR models are found very high over the
Wisconsin-Indiana-Michigan (the Great Lake) region, as well as several parts of

January (Dcx ~ -336 nT). The amplitudes of the cosmic-ray variations and sudden
storm commencements show the impact of the first ICME as the largest (~ 6%
decrease in CR and 72 nT in SSC) and the ICME associated with the storms that
followed as more moderate (~ 3% decrease in CR and 63 nT in SSC; ~ 2% decrease
in CR and 63 nT in SSC). Interestingly, a significant solar proton event
occurred on 16/17 January and the Cheltenham ionization chamber showed a
possible ground level enhancement. During the first storm, aurorae were less
visible at mid-latitudes, whereas during the second and third storms, the
equatorward boundaries of the auroral oval were extended down to 40.3{\deg} and
40.0{\deg} in invariant latitude. This contrast shows that the initial ICME was
probably faster, with a higher total magnitude but a smaller southward
component.

the rapidly developing branches of physics like quantum information science or
quantum optics. Such an averaging process can be always represented as
averaging with respect to a finite number of elements of the group, called a
finite averaging set. In the previous research such sets, known as $t$-designs,
were constructed only for the case of averaging over unitary groups (hence the
name unitary $t$-designs). In this work we investigate the problem of
constructing finite averaging sets for averaging over general non-compact
matrix Lie groups, which is much more subtle task due to the fact that the the
uniform invariant measure on the group manifold (the Haar measure) is infinite.
We provide a general construction of such sets based on the Cartan
decomposition of the group, which splits the group into its compact and
non-compact components. The averaging over the compact part can be done in a
uniform way, whereas the averaging over the non-compact one has to be endowed
with a suppresing weight function, and can be approached using generalised
Gauss quadratures. This leads us to the general form of finite averaging sets
for semisimple matrix Lie groups in the product form of finite averaging sets
with respect to the compact and non-compact parts. We provide an explicit
calculation of such sets for the group $SL(2, \mathbb{C})$, although our
construction can be applied to other cases. Possible applications of our
results cover finding finite ensambles of random operations in quantum
information science and quantum optics, which can be used in constructions of
randomised quantum algorithms, including optical interferometric
implementations.

observations of a discrete-time linear process with Gaussian noise, and report
the observations to a remote estimator. The challenge is the presence of a few
potentially malicious sensors which can start strategically manipulating their
observations at a random time in order to skew the estimates. The quickest
attack detection problem for a known {\em linear} attack scheme in the Bayesian
setting with a Geometric prior on the attack initiation instant is posed as a
constrained Markov decision process (MDP), in order to minimize the expected
detection delay subject to a false alarm constraint, with the state involving
the probability belief at the estimator that the system is under attack. State
transition probabilities are derived in terms of system parameters, and the
structure of the optimal policy is derived analytically. It turns out that the
optimal policy amounts to checking whether the probability belief exceeds a
threshold. Next, generalized CUSUM based attack detection algorithm is proposed
for the non-Bayesian setting where the attacker chooses the attack initiation
instant in a particularly adversarial manner. It turns out that computing the
statistic for the generalised CUSUM test in this setting relies on the same
techniques developed to compute the state transition probabilities of the MDP.
Numerical results demonstrate significant performance gain under the proposed

minimal hypersurface in a compact Riemannian manifold $N^{n+1}$ with $n\geq 2$.
This was achieved by employing an Allen--Cahn approximation scheme and a
one-parameter minmax for the Allen--Cahn energy (relying on works by
Hutchinson, Tonegawa, Wickramasekera to pass to the limit as the Allen-Cahn
parameter tends to $0$). The minimal hypersurface obtained may a priori carry a
locally constant integer multiplicity. Here we consider a minmax construction
that is a modification of the one in the aforementioned work, by allowing an
initial freedom on the choice of the valley points between which the mountain
pass construction is carried out, and then optimising over said choice. We
prove that, when $2\leq n\leq 6$ and the metric is bumpy, this minmax leads to
a (smooth closed) minimal hypersurface with multiplicity $1$. (When $n=2$ this
conclusion also follows from Chodosh--Mantoulidis's recent work.) As immediate
corollary we obtain that every compact Riemannian manifold of dimension $n+1$,
$2\leq n\leq 6$, endowed with a bumpy metric, admits a two-sided smooth closed
minimal hypersurface (this existence conclusion also follows from Zhou's recent
result for minmax constructions via Almgren--Pitts theory).

Specifically, after motivating physically such interactions, in the context of
string-inspired low-energy effective field theories, involving right-handed

within the so-called Parity-Time-reversal(PT)-symmetry framework, as well as
dynamical mass generation, induced by the Yukawa interactions, for both
fermions and axions. The Yukawa couplings are assumed weak, given that they are
conjectured to have been generated by non-perturbative effects in the
underlying microscopic string theory. The models under discussion contain, in
addition to the Yukawa terms, also anti-Hermitian anomalous derivative
couplings of the pseudoscalar fields to axial fermion currents, as well as
interactions of the fermions with non-Hermitian axial backgrounds. We discuss
the role of such additional couplings on the Yukawa-induced
dynamically-generated masses. For the case where the fermions are right-handed
neutrinos, we compare such masses with the radiative ones induced by both, the
anti-Hermitian anomalous terms and the anti-Hermitian Yukawa interactions in

hadron storage rings for delivery of unprecedented performance. One such
application is the electron-ion collider presently under development in the US.
The desire to develop electron coolers for operation at much higher energies
than previously achieved necessitates the use of radio-frequency (RF) fields
for acceleration as opposed to the conventional, electrostatic approach. While
electron cooling is a mature technology at low energy utilizing a DC beam, RF
acceleration requires the cooling beam to be bunched, thus extending the
parameter space to an unexplored territory. It is important to experimentally
demonstrate the feasibility of cooling with electron bunches and further
investigate how the relative time structure of the two beams affects the
cooling properties; thus, a set of four pulsed-beam cooling experiments was
carried out by a collaboration of Jefferson Lab and Institute of Modern Physics
(IMP).
  The experiments have successfully demonstrated cooling with a beam of
electron bunches in both the longitudinal and transverse directions for the
first time. We have measured the effect of the electron bunch length and
longitudinal ion focusing strength on the temporal evolution of the
longitudinal and transverse ion beam profile and demonstrate that if the
synchronization can be accurately maintained, the dynamics are not adversely
affected by the change in time structure.

their algorithmic applications beyond distance queries. We focus on
eccentricity queries and distance-sum queries, for several versions of these
problems on directed weighted graphs, that is in part motivated by their
importance in facility location problems. On the negative side, we show
conditional lower bounds for these above problems on unweighted undirected

compute both the eccentricity and the distance-sum of any vertex in $2^{{O}(k)}

not has profound implications for fundamental physics and gravitational-wave

but otherwise arbitrary, multipolar tidal environment. By solving the static
Teukolsky equation for the gauge-invariant Weyl scalar $\psi_0$, and by
reconstructing the corresponding metric perturbation in an ingoing radiation
gauge, for a general harmonic index $\ell$, we compute the linear response of a
Kerr black hole to the tidal field. This linear response vanishes identically
for a Schwarzschild black hole and for an axisymmetric perturbation of a
spinning black hole. For a nonaxisymmetric perturbation of a spinning black
hole, however, the linear response does not vanish, and it contributes to the
Geroch-Hansen multipole moments of the perturbed Kerr geometry. As an
application, we compute explicitly the rotational black hole tidal Love numbers
that couple the induced quadrupole moments to the quadrupolar tidal fields, to
linear order in the black hole spin, and we introduce the corresponding notion
of tidal Love tensor. Finally, we show that those induced quadrupole moments
are closely related to the well-known physical phenomenon of tidal torquing of
a spinning body interacting with a tidal gravitational environment.

mesoscopic samples of Sr2RuO4 in cantilever torque magnetometry measurements,
thus providing direct evidence for spin-triplet pairing in the material. In
addition, it raised important questions on HQV, including its stability and
dynamics. These issues have remained largely unexplored, in particular,
experimentally. We report in this paper the detection of HQVs in mesoscopic,
doubly connected cylinders of single-crystalline Sr2RuO4 of a mesoscopic size
and the examination of the effect of the in-plane magnetic field needed for the
observation of the HQV by magnetoresistance (MR) oscillations measurements.
Several distinct features found in our data, especially a dip and secondary
peaks in the MR oscillations seen only in the presence of a sufficiently large
in-plane magnetic field as well as a large measurement current, are linked to
the formation of the HQV fluxoid state in and crossing of an Abrikosov HQV
through the sample. The conclusion is drawn from the analysis of our data using
a model of thermally activated vortex crossing overcoming a free-energy barrier
which is modulated by the applied magnetic flux enclosed in the cylinder as
well as the measurement current. Evidence for the trapping of an HQV fluxoid
state in the sample was also found. Our observation of the HQV in mesoscopic
Sr2RuO4 provided not only additional evidence for spin-triplet
superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 but also insights into the physics of HQV,

group improved effective potential for theories with a large mass hierarchy.
Our method allows one to compute the effective potential in a systematic
expansion in powers of the mass ratio, as well as to sum large logarithms of
mass ratios using renormalization group evolution. The effective potential is
the sum of one-particle irreducible diagrams (1PI) but information about which
diagrams are 1PI is lost after matching to the EFT, since heavy lines get
shrunk to a point. We therefore introduce a tadpole condition in place of the
1PI condition, and use the renormalization group improved value of the tadpole
in computing the effective potential. We explain why the effective potential
computed using an EFT is not the same as the effective potential of the EFT. We
illustrate our method using the $O(N)$ model, a theory of two scalars in the
unbroken and broken phases, and the Higgs-Yukawa model. Our leading-log result,
obtained by integrating the one-loop $\beta$-functions, correctly reproduces
the log-squared term in explicit two-loop calculations. Our method does not

Specifically, three vertices in a graph form an asteroidal triple (AT) if
between any two of them there exists a path that avoids the closed
neighbourhood of the third one. We call a graph AT-free if it does not contain
an AT. We first prove that for all $m$-edge AT-free graphs, one can compute all

generalizing interval graphs in various ways --, as an attempt to understand

models treat them as such. Here we study ridge regression when the analyst can
partition the features into $K$ groups based on external side-information. For
example, in high-throughput biology, features may represent gene expression,
protein abundance or clinical data and so each feature group represents a
distinct modality. The analyst's goal is to choose optimal regularization
parameters $\lambda = (\lambda_1, \dotsc, \lambda_K)$ -- one for each group. In
this work, we study the impact of $\lambda$ on the predictive risk of
group-regularized ridge regression by deriving limiting risk formulae under a
high-dimensional random effects model with $p\asymp n$ as $n \to \infty$.
Furthermore, we propose a data-driven method for choosing $\lambda$ that
attains the optimal asymptotic risk: The key idea is to interpret the residual
noise variance $\sigma^2$, as a regularization parameter to be chosen through
cross-validation. An empirical Bayes construction maps the one-dimensional
parameter $\sigma$ to the $K$-dimensional vector of regularization parameters,
i.e., $\sigma \mapsto \widehat{\lambda}(\sigma)$. Beyond its theoretical
optimality, the proposed method is practical and runs as fast as
cross-validated ridge regression without feature groups ($K=1$).

architecture search due to high efficiency and competitive performance.
However, weight sharing across models has an inherent deficiency, i.e.,
insufficient training of subnetworks in hypernetworks. To alleviate this
problem, we present a simple yet effective architecture distillation method.
The central idea is that subnetworks can learn collaboratively and teach each
other throughout the training process, aiming to boost the convergence of
individual models. We introduce the concept of prioritized path, which refers
to the architecture candidates exhibiting superior performance during training.
Distilling knowledge from the prioritized paths is able to boost the training
of subnetworks. Since the prioritized paths are changed on the fly depending on
their performance and complexity, the final obtained paths are the cream of the
crop. We directly select the most promising one from the prioritized paths as
the final architecture, without using other complex search methods, such as
reinforcement learning or evolution algorithms. The experiments on ImageNet
verify such path distillation method can improve the convergence ratio and
performance of the hypernetwork, as well as boosting the training of
subnetworks. The discovered architectures achieve superior performance compared
to the recent MobileNetV3 and EfficientNet families under aligned settings.
Moreover, the experiments on object detection and more challenging search space
show the generality and robustness of the proposed method. Code and models are

structure by replacing its original normalization layers and hence cause
significant performance drops. To this end, we propose a new passport-aware
normalization formulation, which is generally applicable to most existing
normalization layers and only needs to add another passport-aware branch for IP
protection. This new branch is jointly trained with the target model but
discarded in the inference stage. Therefore it causes no structure change in
the target model. Only when the model IP is suspected to be stolen by someone,
the private passport-aware branch is added back for ownership verification.
Through extensive experiments, we verify its effectiveness in both image and 3D
point recognition models. It is demonstrated to be robust not only to common
attack techniques like fine-tuning and model compression, but also to ambiguity
attacks. By further combining it with trigger-set based methods, both black-box
and white-box verification can be achieved for enhanced security of deep
learning models deployed in real systems. Code can be found at

physically equivalent, descriptions. In one description, based on global
spacetime of general relativity, the existence of the interior region is
manifest, while understanding unitarity requires nonperturbative quantum
gravity effects such as replica wormholes. The other description adopts a
manifestly unitary, or holographic, description, in which the interior emerges
effectively as a collective phenomenon of fundamental degrees of freedom.
  In this paper we study the latter approach, which we refer to as the unitary
gauge construction. In this picture, the formation of a black hole is signaled
by the emergence of a surface (stretched horizon) possessing special dynamical
properties: quantum chaos, fast scrambling, and low energy universality. These
properties allow for constructing interior operators, as we do explicitly,
without relying on details of microscopic physics. A key role is played by
certain coarse modes in the zone region (hard modes), which determine the
degrees of freedom relevant for the emergence of the interior.
  We study how the interior operators can or cannot be extended in the space of
microstates and analyze irreducible errors associated with such extension. This
reveals an intrinsic ambiguity of semiclassical theory formulated with a finite
number of degrees of freedom. We provide an explicit prescription of
calculating interior correlators in the effective theory, which describes only
a finite region of spacetime. We study the issue of state dependence of
interior operators in detail and discuss a connection of the resulting picture
with the quantum error correction interpretation of holography.

developed by studying two-dimensional moduli spaces in supersymmetric string
compactifications. It is proposed that there exist theories on the boundaries
of each moduli space, whose crucial data are given by a Hilbert space, an
Sl(2,C)-algebra, and two special operators. This boundary data is motivated by
asymptotic Hodge theory and the fact that the physical metric on the moduli
space of Calabi-Yau manifolds asymptotes near any infinite distance boundary to
a Poincare metric with Sl(2,R) isometry. The crucial part of the bulk theory on
the moduli space is a sigma model for group-valued matter fields. It is
discussed how this might be coupled to a two-dimensional gravity theory. The
classical bulk-boundary matching is then given by the proof of the famous Sl(2)
orbit theorem of Hodge theory, which is reformulated in a more physical
language. Applying this correspondence to the flux landscape in Calabi-Yau
fourfold compactifications it is shown that there are no infinite tails of
self-dual flux vacua near any co-dimension one boundary. This finiteness result
is a consequence of the constraints on the near boundary expansion of the bulk

special-relativistic effects such as aberration. The required velocities for
these to be significant are on the order of $1000\,\textrm{km s}^{-1}$. This
value corresponds to the velocity dispersion that one finds in clusters of
galaxies. Hence, we expect a large number of gravitational-wave sources to have
such effects imprinted in their signals. In particular, the signal from a
moving source will have its higher modes excited, i.e., $(3,3)$ and beyond. We
derive expressions describing this effect, and study its measurability for the
specific case of a circular, non-spinning extreme-mass-ratio inspiral. We find
that the excitation of higher modes by a peculiar velocity of
$1000\,\textrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ is detectable for such inspirals with
signal-to-noise ratios of $\gtrsim20$. Using a Fisher matrix analysis, we show
that the velocity of the source can be measured to a precision of just a few
percent for a signal-to-noise ratio of 100. If the motion of the source is
ignored parameter estimates could be biased, e.g., the estimated masses of the
components through a Doppler shift. Conversely, by including this effect in

of the cosmic neutral hydrogen (HI) signal from foregrounds in the presence of
noise. Cleaned maps recover cosmological clustering statistics within 10% at
all relevant angular scales and frequencies. This amounts to a reduction in
prediction variance of over an order of magnitude on small angular scales

0.17\ \rm h\ Mpc^{-1})$ compared to standard Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
methods. We estimate posterior confidence intervals for the network's
prediction by training an ensemble of UNets. Our approach demonstrates the
feasibility of analyzing 21cm intensity maps, as opposed to derived summary
statistics, for upcoming radio experiments, as long as the simulated foreground

gaining popularity. Many of these searches are highly dependent on the value of
the photoelectric absorption cross section of silicon at low temperatures,
particularly near the silicon band gap energy, where the searches are most
sensitive to low mass dark matter candidates. While such cross section data has
been lacking from the literature, previous dark matter search experiments have
attempted to estimate this parameter by extrapolating it from higher
temperature data. However, discrepancies in the high temperature data have led
to order-of-magnitude differences in the extrapolations. In this paper, we
resolve these discrepancies by using a novel technique to make a direct, low
temperature measurement of the photoelectric absorption cross section of
silicon at energies near the band gap.

training independent neural networks that simultaneously process strain data

processed to identify significant noise triggers. We have applied this

identify binary black hole mergers in open source data available at the
Gravitational-Wave Open Science Center. We have also benchmarked the
performance of this new methodology by processing 200 hours of open source,

identifies real gravitational wave sources in advanced LIGO data with a false
positive rate of 1 misclassification for every 2.7 days of searched data. A
follow up of these misclassifications identified them as glitches. Our deep
learning ensemble represents the first class of neural network classifiers that

from the $K$-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS), we quantify the
[NII]/H$\alpha$ emission-line ratio, a proxy for the gas-phase Oxygen abundance
within the interstellar medium. We define the stellar mass-metallicity relation
at $z \approx0.6-1.0$ and $z \approx1.2-1.8$ and analyse the correlation
between the scatter in the relation and fundamental galaxy properties (e.g.
H$\alpha$ star-formation rate, H$\alpha$ specific star-formation rate, rotation
dominance, stellar continuum half-light radius and Hubble-type morphology). We
find that for a given stellar mass, more highly star-forming, larger and
irregular galaxies have lower gas-phase metallicities, which may be
attributable to their lower surface mass densities and the higher gas fractions
of irregular systems. We measure the radial dependence of gas-phase metallicity
in the galaxies, establishing a median, beam smearing-corrected, metallicity
gradient of $ \Delta Z/ \Delta R=0.002 \pm0.004$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, indicating on
average there is no significant dependence on radius. The metallicity gradient
of a galaxy is independent of its rest-frame optical morphology, whilst
correlating with its stellar mass and specific star-formation rate, in
agreement with an inside-out model of galaxy evolution, as well as its rotation
dominance. We quantify the evolution of metallicity gradients, comparing the
distribution of $\Delta Z/ \Delta R$ in our sample with numerical simulations
and observations at $z \approx0-3$. Galaxies in our sample exhibit flatter
metallicity gradients than local star-forming galaxies, in agreement with
numerical models in which stellar feedback plays a crucial role redistributing
metals.

the molecular gas. The higher molecular gas content is related to AGN galaxies
hosting a population of gas-rich early types with an order of magnitude more
molecular gas and a smaller fraction of quenched, passive galaxies (~5% vs.
49%). The likelihood of a given galaxy hosting an AGN (L_bol>10^44 erg/s)
increases by ~10-100 between a molecular gas mass of 10^8.7 Msun and 10^10.2

masses and gas fractions. Higher column density AGN galaxies (Log NH>23.4) are
associated with lower depletion timescales and may prefer hosts with more gas
centrally concentrated in the bulge that may be more prone to quenching than
galaxy wide molecular gas. The significant average link of host galaxy
molecular gas supply to SMBH growth may naturally lead to the general
correlations found between SMBHs and their host galaxies, such as the
correlations between SMBH mass and bulge properties and the redshift evolution

quantum lattice models is an ongoing focus in many-body physics. While the
density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) has been established as a
practically useful algorithm for finding the ground state in 1D systems, a
provably efficient and accurate algorithm remained elusive until the
introduction of the rigorous renormalization group (RRG) by Landau et al.
[Nature Physics 11, 566 (2015)]. In this paper, we study the accuracy and
performance of a numerical implementation of RRG at first order phase
transitions and in symmetry protected topological phases. Our study is motived
by the question of when RRG might provide a useful complement to the more
established DMRG technique. In particular, despite its general utility, DMRG
can give unreliable results near first order phase transitions and in
topological phases, since its local update procedure can fail to adequately
explore (near) degenerate manifolds. The rigorous theoretical underpinnings of
RRG, meanwhile, suggest that it should not suffer from the same difficulties.
We show this optimism is justified, and that RRG indeed determines accurate,
well-ordered energies even when DMRG does not. Moreover, our performance
analysis indicates that in certain circumstances seeding DMRG with states
determined by coarse runs of RRG may provide an advantage over simply
performing DMRG.

to accelerate Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) in the shocks of supernova remnants
(SNRs). The turbulence upstream is supposedly generated by the CRs, but this
process is not well understood. The dominant mechanism may depend on the
evolutionary state of the shock and can be studied via the CRs escaping
upstream into the interstellar medium (ISM). Aims. Previous observations of the
$\gamma$-Cygni SNR showed a difference in morphology between GeV and TeV
energies. Since this SNR has the right age and is at the evolutionary stage for
a significant fraction of CRs to escape, we aim to understand $\gamma$-ray
emission in the vicinity of the $\gamma$-Cygni SNR. Methods. We observed the
region of the $\gamma$-Cygni SNR with the MAGIC Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov
telescopes between May 2015 and September 2017 recording 87 h of good-quality
data. Additionally we analysed Fermi-LAT data to study the energy dependence of
the morphology as well as the energy spectrum in the GeV to TeV range. The
energy spectra and morphology were compared against theoretical predictions,
which include a detailed derivation of the CR escape process and their
$\gamma$-ray generation. Results. The MAGIC and Fermi-LAT data allowed us to
identify three emission regions, which can be associated with the SNR and
dominate at different energies. Our hadronic emission model accounts well for
the morphology and energy spectrum of all source components. It constrains the
time-dependence of the maximum energy of the CRs at the shock, the
time-dependence of the level of turbulence, and the diffusion coefficient
immediately outside the SNR shock. While in agreement with the standard picture
of DSA, the time-dependence of the maximum energy was found to be steeper than
predicted and the level of turbulence was found to change over the lifetime of
the SNR.

the GW modes in turn affects the overall frequency of the GW, thus leading to a

This effect breaks the degeneracy between mass and Doppler shift in GW

dark matter halos, based on a similarity solution applicable to spherical
systems. Performing simplified radiative transfer, we compute how the accreting
gas turns increasingly neutral as it self-shields from the ionising background,
and obtain the column density, $N_{\rm HI}$, as a function of impact parameter.
The resulting column-density distribution function (CDDF) is in excellent
agreement with observations. The analytical expression elucidates (1) why halos
over a large range in mass contribute about equally to the CDDF as well as (2)
why the CDDF evolves so little with redshift in the range $z=2\rightarrow 5$.
We show that the model also predicts reasonable DLA line-widths ($v_{90}$),
bias and molecular fractions. Integrating over the CDDF yields the mass density
in neutral gas, $\Omega_{\rm HI}$, which agrees well with observations.
$\Omega_{\rm HI}(z)$ is nearly constant even though the accretion rate onto
halos evolves. We show that this occurs because the fraction of time that the
inflowing gas is neutral depends on the dynamical time of the halo, which is
inversely proportional to the accretion rate. Encapsulating results from
cosmological simulations, the simple model shows that most Lyman-limit system
and damped Lyman-alpha absorbers are associated with the cosmological accretion
of gas onto halos.

the implications of restricting the latter to four spacetime dimensions and
give a direct link between its canonical form and the canonical form for the

the gauge theory, we find that we can compare the resulting reduced form with
the pull-back of the associahedron form. In particular, the associahedron form
is the sum over all helicity sectors of the reduced momentum amplituhedron
forms. This relation highlights the common singularity structure of the
respective amplitudes; in particular the factorization channels, corresponding
to vanishing planar Mandelstam variables, are the same. Additionally, we also
find a relation between these canonical forms directly on the kinematic space

architectures is to protect sensitive services in isolated execution contexts,
called enclaves. Unfortunately, existing TEE solutions suffer from significant
design shortcomings. First, they follow a one-size-fits-all approach offering
only a single enclave type, however, different services need flexible enclaves
that can adjust to their demands. Second, they cannot efficiently support
emerging applications (e.g., Machine Learning as a Service), which require
secure channels to peripherals (e.g., accelerators), or the computational power
of multiple cores. Third, their protection against cache side-channel attacks
is either an afterthought or impractical, i.e., no fine-grained mapping between
cache resources and individual enclaves is provided.
  In this work, we propose CURE, the first security architecture, which tackles
these design challenges by providing different types of enclaves: (i) sub-space
enclaves provide vertical isolation at all execution privilege levels, (ii)
user-space enclaves provide isolated execution to unprivileged applications,
and (iii) self-contained enclaves allow isolated execution environments that
span multiple privilege levels. Moreover, CURE enables the exclusive assignment
of system resources, e.g., peripherals, CPU cores, or cache resources to single
enclaves. CURE requires minimal hardware changes while significantly improving
the state of the art of hardware-assisted security architectures. We
implemented CURE on a RISC-V-based SoC and thoroughly evaluated our prototype

more sense having a growing density of Internet of Things (IoT) devices
exchanging private information over the network. In this paper, we improve the
5G network slicing authentication using a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) scheme:
granting users full control over their data. We introduce an approach to allow
a user to prove his right to access a specific service without leaking any
information about him. Such an approach is SANS, a protocol that provides
non-linkable protection for any issued information, preventing an SO or an

framework for improving related technologies in similar scenarios, like

In this work, we present an architectural analysis of a linear-tape

  In particular, we introduce TILT, a linear ""Turing-machine-like"" architecture

forth under the laser head. We find that TILT can substantially reduce

TILT. The first heuristic reduces the number of swap operations by matching
data traveling in opposite directions into an ""opposing swap"", and also avoids
the maximum swap distance across the width of the head, as maximum swap
distances make scheduling multiple swaps in one head position difficult. The
second heuristic minimizes ion chain motion by scheduling the tape to the
position with the maximal executable operations for every movement. We provide
application performance results from our simulation, which suggest that TILT
can outperform QCCD in a range of NISQ applications in terms of success rate
(up to 4.35x and 1.95x on average). We also discuss using TILT as a building

accelerate model convergence. To reduce search space, we employ the copy and
masking mechanisms in our encoder-decoder architecture to drastically reduce
the decoder output vocabulary and improve model generalizability. We equip our
model with a memory buffer that stores high-reward promising programs. Besides,
we propose an adaptive reward function. By comparing the generated trial with
the trials stored in the memory buffer, we derive the curriculum-guided reward
bonus, i.e., the proximity and the novelty. To mitigate the sparse reward
problem, we combine the adaptive reward and the reward bonus, reshaping the
sparse reward into dense feedback. Also, we encourage the model to generate new

mathematical foundation (uniform recurrence equations and space-time
transform), our language has a high abstraction level and covers a wide range
of applications. A programmer {\it specifies} a projection of a dataflow
compute onto a linear systolic array, while leaving the detailed implementation
of the projection to a compiler; the compiler implements the specified
projection and maps the linear systolic array to the SIMD execution units and
vector registers of GPUs. In this way, both productivity and performance are
achieved in the same time. This approach neatly combines loop transformations,
data shuffling, and vector register allocation into a single framework.
Meanwhile, many other optimizations can be applied as well; the compiler
composes the optimizations together to generate efficient code.
  We implemented the approach on Intel GPUs. This is the first system that
allows productive construction of systolic arrays on GPUs. We allow multiple
projections, arbitrary projection directions and linear schedules, which can
express most, if not all, systolic arrays in practice. Experiments with 1- and
2-D convolution on an Intel GEN9.5 GPU have demonstrated the generality of the
approach, and its productivity in expressing various systolic designs for
finding the best candidate. Although our systolic arrays are purely software
running on generic SIMD hardware, compared with the GPU's specialized, hardware
samplers that perform the same convolutions, some of our best designs are up to
59\% faster. Overall, this approach holds promise for productive

can achieve high detection accuracy, their anti-forensic counterparts are less
investigated. Here we explore more \textit{imperceptible} and
\textit{transferable} anti-forensics for fake face imagery detection based on
adversarial attacks. Since facial and background regions are often smooth, even
small perturbation could cause noticeable perceptual impairment in fake face
images. Therefore it makes existing adversarial attacks ineffective as an
anti-forensic method. Our perturbation analysis reveals the intuitive reason of
the perceptual degradation issue when directly applying existing attacks. We
then propose a novel adversarial attack method, better suitable for image
anti-forensics, in the transformed color domain by considering visual
perception. Simple yet effective, the proposed method can fool both deep
learning and non-deep learning based forensic detectors, achieving higher
attack success rate and significantly improved visual quality. Specially, when
adversaries consider imperceptibility as a constraint, the proposed
anti-forensic method can improve the average attack success rate by around 30\%
on fake face images over two baseline attacks. \textit{More imperceptible} and
\textit{more transferable}, the proposed method raises new security concerns to
fake face imagery detection. We have released our code for public use, and
hopefully the proposed method can be further explored in related forensic
applications as an anti-forensic benchmark.

graphs being determined by their generalized spectra. However, the method
applies only to a family of the so called \emph{controllable graphs}; it fails
when the graphs are non-controllable.
  In this paper, we introduce a class of non-controllable graphs, called
\emph{almost controllable graphs}, and prove that, for any pair of almost

exactly two rational orthogonal matrices $Q$ with constant row sums such that

transit ridership, or socio-economic status of residents, in addition to
controlling for station level effects. Our findings reveal that individuals use
ridesourcing as a gap-filling mechanism during rail transit disruptions, but
there is strong variation across situational and locational contexts.
Specifically, our results show larger increases in transit disruption
responsive ridesourcing during weekdays, nonholidays, and more severe
disruptions, as well as in community areas that have higher percentages of
White residents and transit commuters, and on the more affluent northside of
the city. These findings point to new insights with far-reaching implications
on how ridesourcing complements existing transport networks by providing added
capacity during disruptions but does not appear to bring equitable gap-filling
benefits to low-income communities of color that typically have more limited
mobility options.

intensity mapping at the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is the separation of
astrophysical foreground contamination. Recent works have claimed that Gaussian
process regression (GPR) can robustly perform this separation, particularly at
low Fourier $k$ wavenumbers where the signal reaches its peak signal-to-noise
ratio. We revisit this topic by casting GPR foreground subtraction (GPR-FS)
into the quadratic estimator formalism, thereby putting its statistical
properties on stronger theoretical footing. We find that GPR-FS can distort the
window functions at these low k modes, which, without proper decorrelation,
make it difficult to probe the EoR power spectrum. Incidentally, we also show
that GPR-FS is in fact closely related to the widely studied optimal quadratic
estimator. As a case study, we look at recent power spectrum upper limits from
the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) that utilized GPR-FS. We pay close attention to
their normalization scheme, showing that it is particularly sensitive to signal
loss when the EoR covariance is misestimated. This implies possible
ramifications for recent astrophysical interpretations of the LOFAR limits,
because many of the EoR models ruled out do not fall within the bounds of the
covariance models explored by LOFAR. Being more robust to this bias (although
not entirely free of it), we conclude that the quadratic estimator is a more
natural framework for implementing GPR-FS and computing the 21 cm power
spectrum.

areas of science and engineering, from fluid dynamics to electromagnetism. A
common problem that arises in applications is that of constructing smooth
approximants to these vector fields and/or their potentials based only on
discrete samples. Additionally, it is often necessary that the vector
approximants preserve the div-free or curl-free properties of the field to
maintain certain physical constraints. Div/curl-free radial basis functions
(RBFs) are a particularly good choice for this application as they are meshfree
and analytically satisfy the div-free or curl-free property. However, this
method can be computationally expensive due to its global nature. In this
paper, we develop a technique for bypassing this issue that combines
div/curl-free RBFs in a partition of unity framework, where one solves for
local approximants over subsets of the global samples and then blends them
together to form a div-free or curl-free global approximant. The method is
applicable to div/curl-free vector fields in $\R^2$ and tangential fields on
two-dimensional surfaces, such as the sphere, and the curl-free method can be
generalized to vector fields in $\R^d$. The method also produces an approximant
for the scalar potential of the underlying sampled field. We present error
estimates and demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on several test
problems.

ELMo is used to generate contextualized embedding vectors of the protein

through augmented episodic likelihood to increase the diversity of the

recognition (HDSR) have resorted to digit segmentation, which is dominated by
heuristics, thereby imposing substantial constraints on the final performance.
Few of them have been based on segmentation-free strategies where each pixel
column has a potential cut location. Recently, segmentation-free strategies has
added another perspective to the problem, leading to promising results.
However, these strategies still show some limitations when dealing with a large
number of touching digits. To bridge the resulting gap, in this paper, we
hypothesize that a string of digits can be approached as a sequence of objects.
We thus evaluate different end-to-end approaches to solve the HDSR problem,
particularly in two verticals: those based on object-detection (e.g., Yolo and
RetinaNet) and those based on sequence-to-sequence representation (CRNN). The
main contribution of this work lies in its provision of a comprehensive
comparison with a critical analysis of the above mentioned strategies on five
benchmarks commonly used to assess HDSR, including the challenging Touching
Pair dataset, NIST SD19, and two real-world datasets (CAR and CVL) proposed for
the ICFHR 2014 competition on HDSR. Our results show that the Yolo model
compares favorably against segmentation-free models with the advantage of
having a shorter pipeline that minimizes the presence of heuristics-based

we estimate that global maritime trade reduced by -7.0% to -9.6% during the

ions and organic linkers. MOFs play an important role in industrial
applications such as gas separation, gas purification, and electrolytic
catalysis. Important MOF properties such as potential energy are currently
computed via techniques such as density functional theory (DFT). Although DFT
provides accurate results, it is computationally costly. We propose a machine
learning approach for estimating the potential energy of candidate MOFs,
decomposing it into separate pair-wise atomic interactions using a graph neural

MOFs. We also generate a database of 50,000 spatial configurations and
high-quality potential energy values using DFT.

less and less common. While this might have been counterintuitive several
decades ago, nowadays it seems pretty obvious. The main reasons for such a
conception are that (a) logic-based methods are usually brittle when it comes
to processing wide-coverage texts, and (b) instead of automatically learning
from data, they require much of manual effort for development. We make a step
towards to overcome such shortcomings by modeling learning from data as
abduction: reversing a theorem-proving procedure to abduce semantic relations
that serve as the best explanation for the gold label of an inference problem.
In other words, instead of proving sentence-level inference relations with the
help of lexical relations, the lexical relations are proved taking into account
the sentence-level inference relations. We implement the learning method in a
tableau theorem prover for natural language and show that it improves the
performance of the theorem prover on the SICK dataset by 1.4% while still
maintaining high precision (>94%). The obtained results are competitive with
the state of the art among logic-based systems.

statistics of turbulent flows. It consists in spreading rigid fibers in the
flow and tracking their position and orientation in time and therefore been
named ``Fiber Tracking Velocimetry'' (FTV). By choosing different fiber
lengths, i.e. within the inertial or dissipative range of scales, the
statistics of turbulence fluctuations at the selected lengthscale can be probed
accurately by simply measuring the fiber velocity at its two ends, and
projecting it along the transverse-to-the-fiber direction. By means of
fully-resolved direct numerical simulations and experiments, we show that these
fiber-based transverse velocity increments are statistically equivalent to the
(unperturbed) flow transverse velocity increments. Moreover, we show that the
turbulent energy dissipation rate can be accurately measured exploiting
sufficiently short fibers. The technique has been tested against standard
Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) of flow tracers with excellent agreement.
Our technique overcomes the well-known problem of PTV to probe two-point
statistics reliably because of the fast relative diffusion in turbulence that
prevents the mutual distance between particles to remain constant at the
lengthscale of interest. This problem, making it difficult to obtain converged
statistics for a fixed separation distance, is even more dramatic for natural
flows in open domains. A prominent example are oceanic currents, where drifters
(i.e.~the tracer-particle counterpart used in field measurements) disperse
quickly, but at the same time their number has to be limited to save costs.
Inspired by our laboratory experiments, we propose pairs of connected drifters
as a viable option to solve the issue.

introduction of two perturbative expansion parameters, constructed from the
velocity and size of the wiggles, in contrast with the point particle case, for
which a single parameter is sufficient. This further requires us to assign new
power counting rules in the system. We integrate out the modes corresponding to
potential gravitons, yielding an effective action for the radiation gravitons.
We show that this action describes a changing quadrupole, sourced by the
bending modes of the string, which in turn generates gravitational waves. We

modeled with geometric constraints. These geometric constraints are
characterized by restrictions on kinematic trajectories and reaction wrenches

paper presents a method to infer geometric constraints involving unmodeled
objects in human demonstrations using both kinematic and wrench measurements.
Our approach takes a recording of a human demonstration and determines what
constraints are present, when they occur, and their parameters (e.g.
positions). By using both kinematic and wrench information, our methods are
able to reliably identify a variety of constraint types, even if the
constraints only exist for short durations within the demonstration. We present
a systematic approach to fitting arbitrary scleronomic constraint models to
kinematic and wrench measurements. Reaction forces are estimated from
measurements by removing friction. Position, orientation, force, and moment
error metrics are developed to provide systematic comparison between constraint
models. By conducting a user study, we show that our methods can reliably
identify constraints in realistic situations and confirm the value of including
forces and moments in the model regression and selection process.

intended to capture the dislocation density evolution and the deformation of
crystals when subjected to mechanical loading. It does so by solving a set of
transport equations for dislocations concurrently with crystal mechanics
equations, with the latter being cast in the form of an eigenstrain problem.
Incorporating dislocation reactions in the dislocation transport equations is
essential for making such continuum dislocation dynamics predictive. A
formulation is proposed to incorporate dislocation reactions in the transport
equations of the vector density-based continuum dislocation dynamics. This
formulation aims to rigorously enforce dislocation line continuity using the
concept of virtual dislocations that close all dislocation loops involved in
cross slip, annihilation, and glissile and sessile junction reactions. The
addition of virtual dislocations enables us to accurately enforce the
divergence free condition upon the numerical solution of the dislocation
transport equations for all slip systems individually. A set of tests were
performed to illustrate the accuracy of the formulation and the solution of the
transport equations within the vector density-based continuum dislocation
dynamics. Comparing the results from these tests with an earlier approach in
which the divergence free constraint was enforced on the total dislocation
density tensor or the sum of two densities when only cross slip is considered
shows that the new approach yields highly accurate results. Bulk simulations
were performed for a face centered cubic crystal based on the new formulation
and the results were compared with discrete dislocation dynamics predictions of
the same. The microstructural features obtained from continuum dislocation
dynamics were also analyzed with reference to relevant experimental
observations.

  analytical study",,"Phys. Rev. B 103, 165432 (2021)","10.1103/PhysRevB.103.165432",,"cond-mat.mes-hall","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We present exact analytical results for the differential conductance of a
finite Kitaev chain in an N-S-N configuration, where the topological
superconductor is contacted on both sides with normal leads. Our results are
obtained with the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's functions technique, using
the full spectrum of the Kitaev chain without resorting to minimal models. A
closed formula for the linear conductance is given, and the analytical
procedure to obtain the differential conductance for the transport mediated by
higher excitations is described. The linear conductance attains the maximum
value of $e^2/h$ only for the exact zero energy states. Also the differential
conductance exhibits a complex pattern created by numerous crossings and
anticrossings in the excitation spectrum. We reveal the crossings to be
protected by the inversion symmetry, while the anticrossings result from a
pairing-induced hybridization of particle-like and hole-like solutions with the
same inversion character. Our comprehensive treatment of the Kitaev chain
allows us also to identify the contributions of both local and non-local
transmission processes to transport at arbitrary bias voltage. Local Andreev
reflection processes dominate the transport within the bulk gap and diminish
for higher excited states, but reemerge when the bias voltage probes the
avoided crossings. The non-local direct transmission is enhanced above the bulk
gap, but contributes also to the transport mediated by the topological states.

insertion-deletion channel with feedback is introduced. Suppose that the
encoder transmits $n$ binary symbols one-by-one over a channel, in which some
symbols can be deleted and some additional symbols can be inserted. After each
transmission, the encoder is notified about the insertions or deletions that
have occurred within the previous transmission and the encoding strategy can be
adapted accordingly. The goal is to design an encoder that is able to transmit
error-free as much information as possible under the assumption that the total
number of deletions and insertions is limited by $\tau n$, $0<\tau<1$. We show
how this problem can be reduced to the problem of transmitting messages over
the substitution channel. Thereby, the maximal asymptotic rate of feedback
insertion-deletion codes is completely established. The maximal asymptotic rate
for the adversarial substitution channel has been partially determined by
Berlekamp and later finished by Zigangirov. However, the analysis of the lower
bound by Zigangirov is quite complicated. We revisit Zigangirov's result and
present a more elaborate version of his proof.

  perovskite semiconductors",,,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Halide perovskites have emerged as disruptive semiconductors for applications
including photovoltaics and light emitting devices, with modular optoelectronic
properties realisable through composition and dimensionality tuning. Layered
Ruddlesden-Popper perovskites of the form BA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1, where n is the
number of lead-halide and methylammonium (MA) sheets spaced by longer
butylammonium (BA) cations, are particularly interesting due to their unique
two-dimensional character and charge carrier dynamics dominated by strongly
bound excitons. However, long-range energy transport through exciton diffusion
in these materials is not understood or realised. Here, we employ local
time-resolved luminescence mapping techniques to visualise exciton transport in
high-quality exfoliated flakes of the BA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1 perovskite family. We
uncover two distinct transport regimes, depending on the temperature range
studied. At temperatures above 100 K, diffusion is mediated by thermally
activated hopping processes between localised states. At lower temperatures, a
non-uniform energetic landscape emerges in which exciton transport is dominated
by energy funnelling processes to lower energy states, leading to long range
transport over hundreds of nanometres even in the absence of exciton-phonon
coupling and in the presence of local optoelectronic heterogeneity. Efficient,
long-range and switchable excitonic funnelling offers exciting possibilities of
controlled directional long-range transport in these 2D materials for new
device applications.

has become routine since 2010, and is generally associated with shocks internal
to the nova ejecta. These shocks are also expected to heat plasma to $\sim
10^7$ K, resulting in detectable X-ray emission. In this paper, we investigate
13 $\gamma$-ray emitting novae observed with the Neil Gehrels $Swift$
Observatory, searching for 1-10 keV X-ray emission concurrent with $\gamma$-ray
detections. We also analyze $\gamma$-ray observations of novae V407 Lup (2016)
and V357 Mus (2018). We find that most novae do eventually show X-ray evidence
of hot shocked plasma, but not until the $\gamma$-rays have faded below
detectability. We suggest that the delayed rise of the X-ray emission is due to
large absorbing columns and/or X-ray suppression by corrugated shock fronts.
The only nova in our sample with a concurrent X-ray/$\gamma$-ray detection is
also the only embedded nova (V407 Cyg). This exception supports a scenario
where novae with giant companions produce shocks with external circumbinary
material and are characterized by lower density environments, in comparison
with novae with dwarf companions where shocks occur internal to the dense
ejecta.

amplifier (PA) nonlinearities. A two-stage approach is adopted, in which linear
communication channel is equalized at the first stage, and it is followed by a
post-distortion where nonlinear distortion is reduced. In literature, nonlinear
processing techniques are proposed, which performs memoryless compensation of
nonlinear distortion together with FDE. However, in this study, we show that
even if a memoryless nonlinearity exists, the received signal is impaired by
nonlinear inter-symbol-interference. Therefore, we propose a class of symbol
rate post-distortion techniques, which use neighboring received symbols to
suppress the nonlinear interference. Two different post-distortion techniques,
Gaussian process regression (GPR) and neural network (NN) based
post-distorters, are considered. Also, a decision metric, combining outputs of
fractional delayed bank of FDE's after post-distortion, is proposed to overcome
performance degradation of FDE for frequency selective channels under nonlinear
distortion. Performances of the proposed techniques are compared with that of
the state-of-the-art techniques in terms of bit error rate and achievable
information rate metrics via simulations. Simulation results demonstrate that
GPR and NN based post-distortion methods together with bank of FDE outperform

been obtained from a topos-theoretic study of categories of rough sets. The
salient feature of these algebras is that there are two negations, one
intuitionistic and another minimal in nature, along with a condition connecting
the two operators. We study properties of these algebras, give examples, and
compare them with relevant existing algebras. `Intuitionistic Logic with
Minimal Negation (ILM)' corresponding to ccpBas and its extension ILM-${\vee}$
for c$\vee$cpBas, are then investigated. Besides its relations with
intuitionistic and minimal logics, ILM is observed to be related to Peirce's
logic. With a focus on properties of the two negations, two kinds of relational
semantics for ILM and ILM-${\vee}$ are obtained, and an inter-translation
between the two semantics is provided. Extracting features of the two negations
in the algebras, a further investigation is made, following logical studies of
negations that define the operators independently of the binary operator of
implication. Using Dunn's logical framework for the purpose, two logics
$K_{im}$ and $K_{im-{\vee}}$ are presented, where the language does not include
implication. $K_{im}$-algebras are reducts of ccpBas. The negations in the
algebras are shown to occupy distinct positions in an enhanced form of Dunn's
Kite of negations. Relational semantics for $K_{im}$ and $K_{im-{\vee}}$ are
given, based on Dunn's compatibility frames. Finally, relationships are
established between the different algebraic and relational semantics for the

the \textit{IRIS} \siiv, \cii\ and \mgii\ transition region (TR) and
chromospheric lines exhibit different spectral features in the outflows as
compared to neighboring regions at the footpoints (""moss"") of hot AR loops. The
average redshift of \siiv\ in the outflows region ($\approx$ 5.5~km s$^{-1}$)
is smaller than typical moss ($\approx$ 12--13 km~s$^{-1}$) and quiet Sun
($\approx$ 7.5 km~s$^{-1}$) values, while the \cii~line is blueshifted
($\approx$ -1.1--1.5 km~s$^{-1}$), in contrast to the moss where it is observed
to be redshifted by about $\approx$ 2.5 km~s$^{-1}$. Further, we observe that
the low atmosphere underneath the coronal outflows is highly structured, with
the presence of blueshifts in \siiv\ and positive \mgii\ k2 asymmetries (which
can be interpreted as signatures of chromospheric upflows) which are mostly not
observed in the moss. These observations show a clear correlation between the
coronal outflows and the chromosphere and TR underneath, which has not been
shown before. Our work strongly suggests that these regions are not separate
environments and should be treated together, and that current leading theories
of AR outflows, such as the interchange reconnection model, need to take into

temperature increases rapidly from $6\cdot 10^3$ K to $10^6$ K. The opacity in
He I D3 and He I 10830 \AA\ is generated via photoionization-recombination
driven by EUV radiation that is locally generated in the EB at temperatures in
the range of $2\cdot 10^4 - 2\cdot 10^6$ K and electron densities between
$10^{11}$ and $10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$. The synthetic emission signals are a result
of coupling to local conditions in a thin shell around the EB, with
temperatures between $7\cdot 10^3$ and $10^4$ K and electron densities ranging
from $\sim 10^{12}$ to $10^{13}$ cm$^{-3}$. Hence, both strong non-LTE as well
as thermal processes play a role in the formation of He I D3 and He I 10830

the synthetic He I D3 and He I 10830 \AA\ emission signatures are an indicator
of temperatures of at least $2\cdot 10^4$ K and in this case as high as $\sim

subset of unlabeled samples from a pool to query an oracle for their labels, in
order to maximize the accuracy of a supervised learner. However, the unsaid
requirement that the oracle should always assign correct labels is unreasonable
for most situations. We propose an active learning technique for deep neural
networks that is more robust to mislabeling than the previously proposed
techniques. Previous techniques rely on the task network itself to estimate the
novelty of the unlabeled samples, but learning the task (generalization) and
selecting samples (out-of-distribution detection) can be conflicting goals. We
use a separate network to score the unlabeled samples for selection. The
scoring network relies on self-supervision for modeling the distribution of the
labeled samples to reduce the dependency on potentially noisy labels. To
counter the paucity of data, we also deploy another head on the scoring network
for regularization via multi-task learning and use an unusual self-balancing
hybrid scoring function. Furthermore, we divide each query into sub-queries
before labeling to ensure that the query has diverse samples. In addition to
having a higher tolerance to mislabeling of samples by the oracle, the
resultant technique also produces competitive accuracy in the absence of label
noise. The technique also handles the introduction of new classes on-the-fly
well by temporarily increasing the sampling rate of these classes.

nonlinear low-dimensional manifold, it is understood that some sort of geodesic

the success of geodesic distance approximators such as ISOMAP, we propose to
use a minimum spanning tree (MST), a graph-based algorithm, to approximate the
local neighborhood structure and generate structure-preserving distances among

distance metric in the embedding function of autoencoders and develop a new
graph regularized autoencoder, which outperforms a wide range of alternative
methods over 20 benchmark anomaly detection datasets. We further incorporate
the MST regularizer into two generative adversarial networks and find that
using the MST regularizer improves the performance of anomaly detection

high-dimensional covariance matrices as observed in text, click-through,

problem of efficient sparse estimation of covariance matrices with possibly
trillions of entries. The size of the datasets we target requires the algorithm
to be online, as more than one pass over the data is prohibitive. In this
paper, we propose Active Sampling Count Sketch (ASCS), an online and one-pass

accurately. Count Sketch (CS), and other sub-linear compressed sensing
algorithms, offer a natural solution to the problem in theory. However, vanilla
CS does not work well in practice due to a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). At

improves over vanilla CS, demonstrating the merit of our active sampling

the introduction of the alloying element. We consider HMAs where the isolated

the conduction band to split into two bands. We determine the bulk plasma
frequency when the lower-energy band is partially occupied, as by doping, using
a semi-analytical method based on a disorder-averaged Green's function. We
include the nontrivial effects of interband transitions to the higher-energy
band, which limit the plasma frequency to be less than an effective band gap.
We show that the distribution of states in the split bands causes plasmons in
HMAs to behave differently than plasmons in standard metals and semiconductors.
The effective mass of the lower split band $m^*$ changes with alloy fraction,
and we find that the plasmon frequency with small carrier concentration $n$
scales with $\sqrt{n}/m^*$ rather than the $\sqrt{n/m^*}$ that is expected in
standard materials. We suggest experiments to observe these phenomena.
Considering the typical range of material parameters in this group of alloys

result from errors related to soft tissue artifacts, marker placement
inaccuracies or biological day-to-day variability. Research question: How
reliable are skin marker-derived three-dimensional spinal kinematics during
functional activities between two separate measurement sessions? Methods:
Twenty healthy adults (11f/9m) were invited to a movement analysis laboratory
for two visits separated by 7-10 days. At each visit, they performed various
functional activities (i.e. sitting, standing, walking, running, chair rising,
box lifting and vertical jumping), while marker trajectories were recorded
using a skin marker-based 10-camera optical motion capture system and used to
calculate sagittal and frontal plane spinal curvature angles as well as
transverse plane segmental rotational angles in the lumbar and thoracic
regions. Between-session reliability for continuous data and discrete
parameters was determined by analyzing systematic errors using one sample
T-tests as well as by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs)
and minimal detectable changes (MDCs). Results and Significance: The analysis
indicated high relative consistency for sagittal plane curvature angles during
all activities, but not for frontal and transverse plane angles during walking
and running. MDCs were mostly below 15{\deg}, with relative values ranging
between 10% and 750%. This study provides important information that can serve
as a basis for researchers and clinicians aiming at investigating longitudinal
effects of treatment interventions on spinal motion behavior in patients with

results in a more aligned disk, nearly uniform eccentricity profile, and

vibrations, and water translational vibrations have been established. The
calculated frequencies of translation vibrations of water molecules vary from
167 to 205 cm$^{-1}$ depending on the nucleotide sequence. The mode of water
vibrations higher than the modes of internal conformational vibrations of DNA.
The calculated frequencies of water vibrations have shown a sufficient
agreement with the experimental low-frequency vibrational spectra of DNA. The
obtained modes of water vibrations are observed in the same region of the
vibrational spectra of DNA as translation vibrations of water molecules in the
bulk phase. To distinguish the vibrations of water molecules in the DNA minor
groove from those in the bulk water, the dynamics of DNA with heavy water was
also considered. The results have shown that in the case of heavy water the
frequencies of vibrations decrease for about 10 cm$^{-1}$ that may be used in
the experiment to identify the mode of water vibrations in the spine of
hydration in DNA minor groove.

dispersive optical forces are responsible for the nucleation of such
photothermal surface bubbles. High-speed videography shows that the surface
bubble formation is always preceded by the optically driven NPs moving toward

density to form a surface bubble drastically differ depending on if the surface
is forward- or backward-facing the light propagation direction, which cannot be
explained by a purely thermal process (e.g., volumetric heating by plasmonic
NPs). This can be attributed to different optical power densities needed to
enable optical pulling and pushing of NPs in the suspension. Optical pulling
requires higher light intensity to excite supercavitation around NPs to enable
proper optical configuration. Eventually, these optically deposited NPs work as
a surface photothermal heater, seeding the surface bubble nucleation. We also
find that there is a critical number density of deposited NPs to nucleate a
surface bubble at a given laser power density, and it is nearly the same for
both the forward- and the backward-facing surfaces. Our finding reveals
interesting physics leading to photothermal surface bubble generation in

  (Technical Report)","Full version of POPL'18 published paper with all proofs",,,,"cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  String analysis is the problem of reasoning about how strings are manipulated
by a program. It has numerous applications including automatic detection of
cross-site scripting (XSS). A popular string analysis technique includes
symbolic executions, which at their core use string (constraint) solvers. Such
solvers typically reason about constraints expressed in theories over strings
with the concatenation operator as an atomic constraint. In recent years,
researchers started to recognise the importance of incorporating the
replace-all operator and finite transductions in the theories of strings with
concatenation. Such string operations are typically crucial for reasoning about
XSS vulnerabilities in web applications, especially for modelling sanitisation
functions and implicit browser transductions (e.g. innerHTML).
  In this paper, we provide the first string solver that can reason about
constraints involving both concatenation and finite transductions. Moreover, it
has a completeness and termination guarantee for several important fragments
(e.g. straight-line fragment). The main challenge addressed in the paper is the
prohibitive worst-case complexity of the theory. To this end, we propose a
method that exploits succinct alternating finite automata as concise symbolic
representations of string constraints. Alternation offers not only exponential
savings in space when representing Boolean combinations of transducers, but
also a possibility of succinct representation of otherwise costly combinations
of transducers and concatenation. Reasoning about the emptiness of the AFA
language requires a state-space exploration in an exponential-sized graph, for
which we use model checking algorithms (e.g. IC3). We have implemented our
algorithm and demonstrated its efficacy on benchmarks that are derived from XSS
and other examples in the literature.

At stellar scales (nonlinear regime,) we observe that a repulsive interaction
between the two scalars of the type $+\phi_1^2 \phi_2^2$ can stabilize the BEC

We found that a vulnerable class is more likely to have certain smells compared

transfer builds a generic meta-mapping of model parameters from few-shot to

local texture in the volume, and a second neural network to compress the
information contained within each partition. We train both of these components
simultaneously by optimizing a loss function that is designed to promote
accurate reconstruction of each partition, while encouraging spatially smooth
and contiguous partitioning, and discouraging relatively small partitions. We
show that the partitions adapt to the subject specific structural variations of
brain tissue while consistently appearing at similar spatial locations across
subjects. AutoAtlas also produces very low dimensional features that represent
local texture of each partition. We demonstrate prediction of metadata
associated with each subject using the derived feature representations and
compare the results to prediction using features derived from FreeSurfer
anatomical parcellation. Since our features are intrinsically linked to
distinct partitions, we can then map values of interest, such as
partition-specific feature importance scores onto the brain for visualization.

fluxons serve to both encode the information and power the gates. No power is
applied to the gate apart from the energy of the input fluxons, and the two
possible flux polarities represent the bit states. Undamped long Josephson
junctions (LJJs), where fluxons move at practically constant speed from
inertia, form the input and output channels of the gates. LJJs are connected in
the gates by circuit interfaces, which are designed to allow the ballistic
scattering from input to output fluxon states, using the temporary excitation
of a localized mode. The duration of the resonant scattering determines the
operation time of the gate, approximately a few Josephson plasma periods. Due
to the coherent conversions between fluxon and localized modes the ballistic
gates can be very efficient: in our simulations only a few percent of the
fluxon's energy are dissipated in the gate operation. Ballistic-reversible
gates can be combined with other, non-ballistic gate circuits to extend the
range of gate functionalities. Here we describe how the CNOT can be built as a

Store-and-Launch (SNL) gates. The IDSN is a 2-bit ballistic gate, which we
describe and analyze in terms of equivalent 1-bit circuits. The SNL is a

to restore the receiver signal-to-noise ratio in such scenarios, we propose two
novel digital self-interference cancellation approaches based on spline
interpolation. Both employ a Wiener structure, thereby matching the baseband
model of the intermodulation effect. Unlike most state-of-the-art spline-based
adaptive learning schemes, the proposed concept allows for complex-valued in-

stochastic gradient descent concept, where the convergence is supported by an
appropriate step-size normalization. Additionally, we provide a gain control
scheme and enable pipelining in order to facilitate a hardware implementation.
An optional input transform improves the performance consistency for correlated
sequences. In a realistic interference scenario, the proposed algorithms
clearly outperform a state-of-the-art least mean squares variant with
comparable complexity, which is specifically tailored to second-order
intermodulation distortions. The high flexibility of the spline interpolation
allows the spline-based Wiener models to match the performance of the kernel

verify by comparing to real data that COVI-AgentSim is able to reproduce
realistic COVID-19 spread dynamics, and perform a sensitivity analysis to
verify that the relative performance of contact tracing methods are consistent

assigns binary recommendations based on binary test results; and 2) a
rule-based method for feature-based contact tracing (FCT) that assigns a graded
level of recommendation based on diverse individual features. We find all DCT
methods consistently reduce the spread of the disease, and that the advantage
of FCT over BCT is maintained over a wide range of adoption rates.
Feature-based methods of contact tracing avert more disability-adjusted life

assumed to be a pure quark-antiquark ($q\bar{q}$) resonance with quantum
numbers $J^{PC} = 2^{++}$. Recently, it was proposed that the $f_2(1270)$ is a
molecular state made from the attractive interaction of two $\rho$-mesons. Such
a state would be expected to decay strongly to final states with charged pions,
due to the dominant decay $\rho \to \pi^+ \pi^-$, whereas decay to two neutral
pions would likely be suppressed. Here, we measure for the first time the
reaction $\gamma p \to \pi^0 \pi^0 p$, using the CLAS detector at Jefferson Lab
for incident beam energies between 3.6-5.4~GeV. Differential cross sections,
$d\sigma / dt$, for $f_2(1270)$ photoproduction are extracted with good
precision, due to low backgrounds, and are compared with theoretical
calculations.

realizing topological superconductivity. However, all such cases known so far
are based on chalcogenides. Here we report the discovery of superconductivity
induced by Re doping in the topological semimetal Mo$_{5}$Si$_{3}$ with a
tetragonal structure. Partial substitution of Re for Mo in
Mo$_{5-x}$Re$_{x}$Si$_{3}$ results in an anisotropic shrinkage of the unit cell
up to the solubility limit of approximately $x$ = 2. Over a wide doping range
(0.5 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 2), these silicides are found to be weakly coupled
superconductors with a fully isotropic gap. $T_{\rm c}$ increases monotonically
with $x$ from 1.67 K to 5.78 K, the latter of which is the highest among
superconductors of the same structural type. This trend in $T_{\rm c}$
correlates well with the variation of the number of valence electrons, and is
mainly ascribed to the enhancement of electron-phonon coupling. In addition,
band structure calculations reveal that superconducting
Mo$_{5-x}$Re$_{x}$Si$_{3}$ exhibits nontrivial band topology characterized by
$Z_{2}$ invariants (1;000) or (1;111) depending on the Re doping level. Our
results suggest that transition metal silicides are a fertile ground for the
exploration of candidate topological superconductors.

  Class-imbalance View",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent studies have pointed out that many well-developed Visual Question
Answering (VQA) models are heavily affected by the language prior problem,
which refers to making predictions based on the co-occurrence pattern between
textual questions and answers instead of reasoning visual contents. To tackle
it, most existing methods focus on enhancing visual feature learning to reduce
this superficial textual shortcut influence on VQA model decisions. However,
limited effort has been devoted to providing an explicit interpretation for its
inherent cause. It thus lacks a good guidance for the research community to
move forward in a purposeful way, resulting in model construction perplexity in
overcoming this non-trivial problem. In this paper, we propose to interpret the
language prior problem in VQA from a class-imbalance view. Concretely, we
design a novel interpretation scheme whereby the loss of mis-predicted frequent
and sparse answers of the same question type is distinctly exhibited during the
late training phase. It explicitly reveals why the VQA model tends to produce a
frequent yet obviously wrong answer, to a given question whose right answer is
sparse in the training set. Based upon this observation, we further develop a
novel loss re-scaling approach to assign different weights to each answer based
on the training data statistics for computing the final loss. We apply our
approach into three baselines and the experimental results on two VQA-CP
benchmark datasets evidently demonstrate its effectiveness. In addition, we
also justify the validity of the class imbalance interpretation scheme on other
computer vision tasks, such as face recognition and image classification.

turn a deep neural net into a fast, powerful heuristic solver of NP-hard
problems. This approach has a great potential in practical applications because
it allows near-optimal solutions to be found without expert guides armed with
substantial domain knowledge. We introduce Policy Optimization with Multiple
Optima (POMO), an end-to-end approach for building such a heuristic solver.
POMO is applicable to a wide range of CO problems. It is designed to exploit
the symmetries in the representation of a CO solution. POMO uses a modified
REINFORCE algorithm that forces diverse rollouts towards all optimal solutions.
Empirically, the low-variance baseline of POMO makes RL training fast and
stable, and it is more resistant to local minima compared to previous
approaches. We also introduce a new augmentation-based inference method, which
accompanies POMO nicely. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POMO by solving
three popular NP-hard problems, namely, traveling salesman (TSP), capacitated
vehicle routing (CVRP), and 0-1 knapsack (KP). For all three, our solver based
on POMO shows a significant improvement in performance over all recent learned
heuristics. In particular, we achieve the optimality gap of 0.14% with TSP100
while reducing inference time by more than an order of magnitude.

network datasets, we have witnessed the rapid rise of network science. For many
systems, however, the data we have access to is not a direct description of the
underlying network. More and more, we see the drive to study networks that have
been inferred or reconstructed from non-network data---in particular, using
time series data from the nodes in a system to infer likely connections between
them. Selecting the most appropriate technique for this task is a challenging
problem in network science. Different reconstruction techniques usually have
different assumptions, and their performance varies from system to system in
the real world. One way around this problem could be to use several different
reconstruction techniques and compare the resulting networks. However, network
comparison is also not an easy problem, as it is not obvious how best to
quantify the differences between two networks, in part because of the diversity
of tools for doing so. The netrd Python package seeks to address these two

networks is poised near criticality, an intermediate regime lying in between
order and disorder. Such description fits well with the idea that biological
systems, in general, may benefit from the long-range correlations and large
flexibility conferred by a critical regime. Despite the attractiveness of this
proposal, a clear understanding of the possible scenarios leading these
networks to criticality is still lacking. In this work, we compared the
behavior of mitochondrial networks emerging from a dimensionless agent-based
(AB) model and a spatially explicit (SE) model, in which nodes are embedded on
a 2D lattice. In both scenarios, we described the position of the control
parameter at which mitochondrial networks exhibit a dynamical phase transition
as well as the size-dependency of several network features. Furthermore, we
showed that the mitochondrial networks from mouse embryonic fibroblasts
presented similar topologies to the ones generated using the AB model, while
their universal behavior is better described by a SE model. Using finite-size
scaling analysis conducted on models and empirical data we defined the
universality classes they belong and provided the theoretical boundaries for
the mechanisms governing mitochondrial network formation. Our findings predict
the full repertoire of dynamical behavior expected for real mitochondrial
networks under physiological and pathological conditions.

studies on coronal FSMs, showing that the canonical dispersion features have

broadening the range of observations that FSMs can be invoked to account for.
We also summarize the advances in forward modeling studies, emphasizing the

exercise system, is difficult to implement in educational institutions because
of the high cost of implementing and maintaining it. Therefore, there is a need
for a cyber range that can be adopted and maintained at a low cost. Recently,
container type virtualization is gaining attention as it can create a
high-speed and high-density exercise environment. However, existing researches
have not clearly shown the advantages of container virtualization for building
exercise environments. And it is not clear whether the sufficient
vulnerabilities are reproducible, which is required to conduct incident
scenarios in cyber range. In this paper, we compare container virtualization
with existing virtualization type and confirm that the amount of memory, CPU,
and storage consumption can be reduced to less than 1/10 of the conventional
virtualization methods. We also compare and verify the reproducibility of the
vulnerabilities used in common exercise scenarios and confirm that 99.3% of the
vulnerabilities are reproducible. The container-based cyber range can be used
as a new standard to replace existing methods.

promising probes of the possible violations of Lorentz invariance (LIV).
However, these constraints usually depend on the assumption of the unknown
intrinsic time lag in different energy bands and the use of a single
highest-energy photon. A new approach to test the LIV effects has been proposed
by directly fitting the spectral lag behavior of a GRB with a well-defined
transition from positive lags to negative lags. This method simultaneously
provides a reasonable formulation of the intrinsic time lag and robust lower
limits on the quantum-gravity energy scales ($E_{\rm QG}$). In this work, we
perform a global fitting to the spectral lag data of GRB~190114C by considering
the possible LIV effects based on a Bayesian approach. We then derive limits on
$E_{\rm QG}$ and the coefficients of the Standard Model Extension. The Bayes
factors output in our analysis shows a very strong evidence for the
spectral-lag transition in GRB~190114C. Our constraints on a variety of
isotropic and anisotropic coefficients for LIV are somewhat weaker than
existing bounds, but they can be viewed as comparatively robust and have the
promise to complement existing LIV constraints. The observations of GRBs with
higher-energy emissions and higher temporal resolutions will contribute to a
better formulation of the intrinsic time lag and more rigorous LIV constraints

  Identification of COVID-19 Cases from Chest CT scans",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The newly discovered Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been globally
spreading and causing hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world as of
its first emergence in late 2019. Computed tomography (CT) scans have shown
distinctive features and higher sensitivity compared to other diagnostic tests,
in particular the current gold standard, i.e., the Reverse Transcription
Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Current deep learning-based algorithms
are mainly developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify
COVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however, require extensive data augmentation
and large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations between image
instances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend
slice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding
mechanism or rely on a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the
disease. In this paper, we propose a two-stage fully-automated CT-based
framework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases referred to as the
""COVID-FACT"". COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks
and is, therefore, capable of capturing spatial information. In particular, to
make the proposed COVID-FACT independent from sophisticated segmentation of the
area of infection, slices demonstrating infection are detected at the first
stage and the second stage is responsible for classifying patients into COVID
and non-COVID cases. COVID-FACT detects slices with infection, and identifies
positive COVID-19 cases using an in-house CT scan dataset, containing COVID-19,
community acquired pneumonia, and normal cases. Based on our experiments,
COVID-FACT achieves an accuracy of 90.82%, a sensitivity of 94.55%, a
specificity of 86.04%, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, while
depending on far less supervision and annotation, in comparison to its
counterparts.

drastically impacted the world and led to one of the most challenging crisis
across the globe since World War II. The early diagnosis and isolation of
COVID-19 positive cases are considered as crucial steps towards preventing the
spread of the disease and flattening the epidemic curve. Chest Computed
Tomography (CT) scan is a highly sensitive, rapid, and accurate diagnostic
technique that can complement Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction
(RT-PCR) test. Recently, deep learning-based models, mostly based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), have shown promising diagnostic results.
CNNs, however, are incapable of capturing spatial relations between image
instances and require large datasets. Capsule Networks, on the other hand, can
capture spatial relations, require smaller datasets, and have considerably
fewer parameters. In this paper, a Capsule network framework, referred to as
the ""CT-CAPS"", is presented to automatically extract distinctive features of
chest CT scans. These features, which are extracted from the layer before the
final capsule layer, are then leveraged to differentiate COVID-19 from
Non-COVID cases. The experiments on our in-house dataset of 307 patients show
the state-of-the-art performance with the accuracy of 90.8%, sensitivity of

To this end, we take the first step to study the few-shot relational triple
extraction, which has not been well understood. Unlike previous single-task
few-shot problems, relational triple extraction is more challenging as the
entities and relations have implicit correlations. In this paper, We propose a
novel multi-prototype embedding network model to jointly extract the

that bridges text and knowledge concerning both entities and relations. Thus,
implicit correlations between entities and relations are injected.
Additionally, we propose a prototype-aware regularization to learn more
representative prototypes. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed

breaks down and the counter-rotating terms in the quantum Rabi Hamiltonian
leads to the level anti-crossing in the energy spectrum. Choosing a
single-photon driving field at the point of avoided-level crossing, we can get
an equivalent four-level dressed state model, in which the dissipation of the
two intermediate states is only related to the qubits decay. Due to the
electron shelving of these two metastable states, a narrow peak appears in the

apps. The cost of advertising (ad cost) is non-negligible for app developers to
ensure a good user experience and continuous profits. Previous studies mainly
focus on addressing the hidden performance costs generated by ads, including
consumption of memory, CPU, data traffic, and battery. However, there is no
research onanalyzing users' perceptions of ads' performance costs to our
knowledge. Objective: To fill this gap and better understand the effects of
performance costs of in-app ads on user experience, we conduct a study on
analyzing user concerns about ads' performance costs. Method: First, we propose
RankMiner, an approach to quantify user concerns about specific appissues,
including performance costs. Then, based on the usage traces of 20 subject
apps, we measure the performance costs of ads. Finally, we conduct correlation
analysis on the performance costs and quantified user concerns to explore
whether users complain more for higher performance costs. Results: Our findings
include the following: (1) RankMiner can quantify users' concerns better than
baselines by an improvement of 214% and 2.5% in terms of Pearson correlation
coefficient (a metricfor computing correlations between two variables) and NDCG
score (a metric for computing accuracyin prioritizing issues), respectively.
(2) The performance costs of the with-ads versions are statistically
significantly larger than those of no-ads versions with negligible effect size;
(3) Users are moreconcerned about the battery costs of ads, and tend to be
insensitive to ads' data traffic costs. Conclusion: Our study is complementary
to previous work on in-app ads, and can encourage devel-opers to pay more
attention to alleviating the most user-concerned performance costs, such as
battery cost.

While being able to leverage the power of abundant unlabeled data in a
self-supervised manner, nodes selected by AL further provide semantic
information that can better guide representation learning. Besides, previous
work measures the informativeness of nodes without considering the neighborhood
propagation scheme of GNNs, so that noisy nodes may be selected. We argue that
due to the smoothing nature of GNNs, the central nodes from homophilous
subgraphs should benefit the model training most. To this end, we present a
minimax selection scheme that explicitly harnesses neighborhood information and
discover homophilous subgraphs to facilitate active selection. Comprehensive,

time, finite state Markov chain having an unknown transition probability matrix
(TPM) is considered. A total of N sensors are available for making observations
of the Markov chain, out of which a subset of sensors are activated each time
in order to perform reliable estimation of the process. The trade-off is
between activating more sensors to gather more observations for the remote
estimation, and restricting sensor usage in order to save energy and bandwidth
consumption. The problem is formulated as a constrained minimization problem,
where the objective is the long-run averaged mean-squared error (MSE) in
estimation, and the constraint is on sensor activation rate. A Lagrangian
relaxation of the problem is solved by an artful blending of two tools: Gibbs
sampling for MSE minimization and an on-line version of expectation
maximization (EM) to estimate the unknown TPM. Finally, the Lagrange multiplier
is updated using slower timescale stochastic approximation in order to satisfy
the sensor activation rate constraint. The on-line EM algorithm, though adapted
from literature, can estimate vector-valued parameters even under time-varying
dimension of the sensor observations. Numerical results demonstrate
approximately 1 dB better error performance than uniform sensor sampling and
comparable error performance (within 2 dB bound) against complete sensor
observation. This makes the proposed algorithm amenable to practical
implementation.

the position, intensity, and width of the diffraction curve. By studying a
number of continuous random network (CRN) models of ${\it a}$-Si, it is shown
that the position and the intensity of the FSDP are primarily determined by
radial atomic correlations in the amorphous network on the length scale of 15
Angstroms. A shell-by-shell analysis of the contribution from different radial
shells reveals that the key contributions to the FSDP originate from the second
and fourth radial shells in the network, which are accompanied by a background
contribution from the first shell and small residual corrections from the
distant radial shells. The results from numerical calculations are complemented
by a phenomenological discussion of the relationship between the peaks in the
structure factor in the wavevector space and the reduced pair-correlation
function in the real space. An approximate functional relation between the
position of the FSDP and the average second-neighbor distance of Si atoms in
the amorphous network is derived, which is corroborated by numerical
calculations.

  Representation Learning","Accepted to NeurIPS 2021",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we provide a theory of using graph neural networks (GNNs) for
multi-node representation learning (where we are interested in learning a
representation for a set of more than one node, such as link). We know that GNN
is designed to learn single-node representations. When we want to learn a node
set representation involving multiple nodes, a common practice in previous
works is to directly aggregate the single-node representations obtained by a
GNN into a joint node set representation. In this paper, we show a fundamental
constraint of such an approach, namely the inability to capture the dependence
between nodes in the node set, and argue that directly aggregating individual
node representations does not lead to an effective joint representation for
multiple nodes. Then, we notice that a few previous successful works for
multi-node representation learning, including SEAL, Distance Encoding, and
ID-GNN, all used node labeling. These methods first label nodes in the graph
according to their relationships with the target node set before applying a
GNN. Then, the node representations obtained in the labeled graph are
aggregated into a node set representation. By investigating their inner
mechanisms, we unify these node labeling techniques into a single and most
general form -- labeling trick. We prove that with labeling trick a
sufficiently expressive GNN learns the most expressive node set
representations, thus in principle solves any joint learning tasks over node
sets. Experiments on one important two-node representation learning task, link
prediction, verified our theory. Our work explains the superior performance of
previous node-labeling-based methods, and establishes a theoretical foundation
of using GNNs for multi-node representation learning.

of electric potentials at a surface enclosing the heart from remote recordings
at the body surface and an accurate description of the anatomy. The latter
being affected by noise and obtained with limited resolution due to clinical
constraints, a possibly large uncertainty may be perpetuated in the inverse
reconstruction.
  The purpose of this work is to study the effect of shape uncertainty on the
forward and the inverse problem of electrocardiography. To this aim, the
problem is first recast into a boundary integral formulation and then
discretised with a collocation method to achieve high convergence rates and a
fast time to solution. The shape uncertainty of the domain is represented by a
random deformation field defined on a reference configuration. We propose a
periodic-in-time covariance kernel for the random field and approximate the
Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion using low-rank techniques for fast sampling. The
space-time uncertainty in the expected potential and its variance is evaluated
with an anisotropic sparse quadrature approach and validated by a quasi-Monte
Carlo method.
  We present several numerical experiments on a simplified but physiologically
grounded 2-dimensional geometry to illustrate the validity of the approach. The
tested parametric dimension ranged from 100 up to 600. For the forward problem
the sparse quadrature is very effective. In the inverse problem, the sparse
quadrature and the quasi-Monte Carlo method perform as expected, except for the
total variation regularisation, where convergence is limited by lack of
regularity. We finally investigate an $H^{1/2}$ regularisation, which naturally
stems from the boundary integral formulation, and compare it to more classical
approaches.

exhibit many interesting properties. Most frequently, these states are studied
within the framework of phase approximation. The latter is used ubiquitously to
analyze coupled oscillatory systems. Typically, the phase dynamics description
is obtained in the weak coupling limit, i.e., in the first-order in the
coupling strength. The extension beyond the first-order represents an unsolved
problem and is an active area of research. In this paper, three partially
synchronous states are investigated and presented in order of increasing
complexity. First, the usage of the phase response curve for the description of
macroscopic oscillators is analyzed. To achieve this, the response of the
mean-field oscillations in a model of all-to-all coupled limit-cycle
oscillators to pulse stimulation is measured. The next part treats a two-group
Kuramoto model, where the interaction of one attractive and one repulsive group
results in an interesting solitary state, situated between full synchrony and
self-consistent partial synchrony. In the last part, the phase dynamics of a
relatively simple system of three Stuart-Landau oscillators are extended beyond
the weak coupling limit. The resulting model contains triplet terms in the
high-order phase approximation, though the structural connections are only
pairwise. Finally, the scaling of the new terms with the coupling is analyzed.

the ferro-cLC order in a simple frustrated chain Hubbard model. The cLC appears
between the antiferromagnetic and $d$-wave superconducting ($d$SC) phases.
While the microscopic origin of the cLC has a close similarity to that of the
$d$SC, the cLC transition temperature $T_{\rm cLC}$ can be higher than the
$d$SC one for wide parameter range. Furthermore, we reveal that the ferro cLC
order is driven by the strong enhancement of the forward scatterings $g_2$ and
$g_4$ owing to the two dimensionality based on the $g$-ology language. The
present study indicates that the cLC can emerge in metals near the magnetic
criticality with geometrical frustration

$\rm C^{18}O$ ( J = 1 - 0) emission lines are used to study the ongoing star
formation activity in the Aquila molecular region, and the 70 $\mu$m and 250

  Results. The protostellar-prestellar cores are found at locations with the
highest $\rm C^{18}O$ column densities and their increasing evolutionary age
would relate to an increasing 70$\mu$m/250$\mu$m emission ratio at their
location. An evolutionary age of the cores may also follow from the $\rm
^{13}CO$ versus $\rm C^{18}O$ abundance ratio, which decreases with increasing
$\rm C^{18}O$ column densities. The original mass has been estimated for nine
representative star formation regions and the original mass of the region
correlated well with the integrated 70 $\mu$m flux density. Similarly, the $
X_{\rm ^{13}CO}$/$X_{\rm C^{18}O}$ implying the dissociation rate for these
regions correlates with the 70$\mu$m/250$\mu$m flux density ratio and reflects

the analysis of the correlation dependence of the cascade size on the rate of
development of the cascade process. In order to determine the primary energy,
measurements are made based on the number of secondary particles in the
cascade, Ne, at two observation levels Z1 and Z2, separated by an absorber
layer. Based on the obtained measurements, a correlation analysis of the
dependence of logNe(Z1) on the difference dN = log Ne(Z1) - log Ne(Z2) is
carried out. The correlation curves (log Ne from dN) in the negative part of
the dN axis are almost parallel to each other and practically do not depend on
the depth of the cascade development. It makes it possible to determine the
primary energy using an ultrathin calorimeter. The best option for applying the
method is a calorimeter, which has a unit with a heavy target, leading to the
rapid development of the cascade, and a homogeneous measuring and absorption
block.

proposed to cooperate with equalizers to deal with the spectral distortions
caused by limited bandwidth and chromatic dispersion for intensity-modulation
and direct-detection (IM/DD) optical systems. The equalizers compensates the
spectral distortions and optimized detection decodes the useful bits from the
noise. For accurately extracting the bits from more serious noise, the
optimized detection with larger memory length is required. However, the
classical optimized detection such as maximum likelihood-sequence estimation
(MLSE) requires exponential-growing computational complexity and storage with
the increasing memory length. The fixed-state Log-MAP detection can decrease
the computational complexity and storage from the exponential order to linear
order. Therefore, the fixed-state Log-MAP detection can compensate more
distortions compared to MLSE under the same hardware condition. We
experimentally verify the fixed-state Log-MAP detection in a C-band 64 Gbit/s

Under the same hardware condition, the fixed-state Log-MAP detection has a 2 dB
improvement of receiver sensitivity compared to MLSE. In conclusion, the

that was previously introduced for operator reconstruction problems in the
field of quantum mechanics. This algorithm is based on an offline/online
decomposition of the reconstruction process and on an ansatz for the unknown
operator obtained by an a priori chosen set of linearly independent matrices.
The presented convergence analysis focuses on linear-quadratic (optimization)
problems governed by linear differential systems and reveals the strong
dependence of the performance of the greedy algorithm on the observability
properties of the system and on the ansatz of the basis elements. Moreover, the
analysis allows us to use a precise (and in some sense optimal) choice of basis
elements for the linear case and led to the introduction of a new and more
robust optimized greedy reconstruction algorithm. This optimized approach also
applies to nonlinear Hamiltonian reconstruction problems, and its efficiency is
demonstrated by numerical experiments.

objects appear to be covered by sub-micrometre sized particles (referred to as
hyperfine), there are limited studies on reflectance and emission of
particulate surfaces composed of particles smaller than the visible and
infrared wavelengths. We have undertaken an effort to determine the reflectance
of hyperfine particulate surfaces in conjunction with high-porosity, in order
to simulate the physical state of cometary surfaces and their related asteroids
(P- and D-types). In this work, we present a technique developed to produce
hyperfine particles of astrophysical relevant materials. Hyperfine powders were
prepared and measured in reflectance in the 0.4-2.6 micrometer range. These
powders were then included in water ice particles, sublimated under vacuum, in
order to produce a hyperporous sample of hyperfine material. When grinded below
one micrometre, the four materials studied (olivine, smectite, pyroxene and
amorphous silica), show strong decrease of their absorption features together
with a blueing of the spectra. This small grain degeneracy implies that
surfaces covered by hyperfine grains should show only shallow absorption
features if any. These two effects, decrease of band depth and spectral
blueing, appear magnified when the grains are incorporated in the hyperporous
residue. We interpret the distinct behaviour between hyperporous and more
compact surfaces by the distancing of individual grains and a decrease in the
size of the elemental scatterers. This work implies that hyperfine grains are
unabundant at the surfaces of S- or V-type asteroids, and that the blue nature
of B-type may be related to a physical effect rather than a compositional
effect.

free-field Green's functions to model the sound propagation between source and

applications and the beamforming results can suffer from this inconsistency
regarding both, accuracy of source power estimation, and accuracy of source
localisation. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether the use of
numerically calculated Green's functions can improve the results of beamforming
measurements.
  The current test cases of numerical and experimental investigations consists
of sources placed in a short rectangular duct. The measurement is performed
outside the duct in a semi-anechoic chamber. A typical example for this kind of
installation is a fan with a heat exchanger.
  The Green's functions for this test case are calculated numerically using the
boundary element method. These tailored Green's functions are used to calculate
the corresponding beamforming steering vectors. The weighting of the Green's
functions in the steering vectors has a decisive influence on the beamforming
results. A generalization of the common steering vector formulations is given
based on two scalars. It is shown that arbitrary differentiable Green's
functions can be used to find the correct source position or source power level
by using the appropriate steering vector formulations.
  Beamforming measurements are performed using a loudspeaker as a reference
source at different positions in the heat exchanger duct. The measurements are
evaluated in the frequency domain and by means of different validation criteria
it can be shown that the results with the numerical calculated Green's function
are improved compared to free field beamforming especially at low frequencies.

consists in recolouring at each step a random vertex of a graph with a new

neighbourhood. It is known that when the total number of colours available is
at least $\Delta +2$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph, this

Moreover, a well known conjecture is that the time it takes for the convergence

weaker variants of this conjecture have been studied in the literature by
allowing either more colours, or restricting the graphs to particular classes,
or both. This paper follows this line of research by studying the mixing time
of the Glauber dynamics on chordal graphs, as well as graphs of bounded

are generally adopted, where customers are directly asked to answer surveys
about their user experience. Since the number of collaborative users is
generally low, network operators rely on Machine Learning models to predict the
satisfaction levels/QoE of the users rather than directly measuring it through
surveys. Finally, combining the true/predicted user satisfaction levels with
information on each user mobility (e.g, which network sites each user has
visited and for how long), an operator may reveal critical areas in the
networks and drive/prioritize investments properly. In this work, we propose an
empirical framework tailored to assess the quality of the detection of
under-performing cells starting from subjective user experience grades. The
framework allows to simulate diverse networking scenarios, where a network
characterized by a small set of under-performing cells is visited by
heterogeneous users moving through it according to realistic mobility models.
The framework simulates both the processes of satisfaction surveys delivery and
users satisfaction prediction, considering different delivery strategies and
evaluating prediction algorithms characterized by different prediction
performance. We use the simulation framework to test empirically the
performance of under-performing sites detection in general scenarios
characterized by different users density and mobility models to obtain insights
which are generalizable and that provide interesting guidelines for network

systems with conservation laws, the approach to the adiabatic limit is hampered

governed by hydrodynamic modes resulting in $\Delta S \sim 1/\sqrt{t_\text{r}}$

examine the distribution of coronaviruses among bats. We analyse the
distribution of SARS-CoV-2 in a nine-week period following lockdown in Italy,
Spain, and Australia. We correlate its incidence with environmental variables
particularly ultraviolet radiation, temperature, and humidity. We establish a
clear negative relationship between COVID-19 and ultraviolet radiation,
modulated by temperature and humidity. We relate our results with data showing
that the bat species most vulnerable to coronavirus infection are those which
live in environmental conditions that are similar to those that appear to be
most favourable to the spread of COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 ecological niche has
been the product of long-term coevolution of coronaviruses with their host
species. Understanding the key parameters of that niche in host species allows
us to predict circumstances where its spread will be most favourable. Such
conditions can be summarised under the headings of nocturnality and
seasonality. High ultraviolet radiation, in particular, is proposed as a key
limiting variable. We therefore expect the risk of spread of COVID-19 to be
highest in winter conditions, and in low light environments. Human activities
resembling those of highly social cave-dwelling bats (e.g. large nocturnal
gatherings or high density indoor activities) will only serve to compound the
problem of COVID-19.

integral part of achieving the sensitivity levels required and will be subject
to an expected neutron fluence of up to $10^{12}$ $n \cdot \mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;$
within regions inside the detector solenoid. Consequently a significant number
of soft errors in the logic of the onboard field programmable gate arrays
(FPGA) can occur, requiring error correction for single event upsets and
firmware reprogramming schemes for unrecoverable soft errors. We studied the
radiation tolerance of the COMET Phase-I front-end trigger system, called
COTTRI, subject to neutron fluence on order $10^{12}$ $n \cdot
\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\;$ with multiple error correcting codes and automatic firmware
reconfiguration. The regions measured were the configuration RAM, block RAM and
also in a multi-gigabit transfer link using copper cables that will be used for
communication between different trigger boards during Phase-I. The resulting
cross sections observed suggest the most significant impact to the experiment
will come from unrecoverable soft errors in configuration RAM, with dead time
expected to be $(4.2 \pm 1.3)\%$. The effect of multi-bit errors in block RAM
was found to be almost negligible in COMET Phase-I. In addition, multiple
solutions have already been proposed in order to suppress these errors further.
Soft errors observed in the multi-gigabit transfer links were measured to be of
two orders of magnitude less impact compared to the unrecoverable errors in

system operation due to its uncertain nature. In droop-controlled microgrids,
the voltage volatility induced by renewable uncertainties is aggravated by the
high droop gains. This paper proposes a chance-constrained optimal power flow
(CC-OPF) problem with power flow routers (PFRs) to better regulate the voltage
profile in microgrids. PFR refer to a general type of network-side controller
that brings more flexibility to the power network. Comparing with the normal
CC-OPF that relies on power injection flexibility only, the proposed model
introduces a new dimension of control from power network to enhance system
performance under renewable uncertainties. Since the inclusion of PFRs
complicates the problem and makes common solvers no longer apply directly, we
design an iterative solution algorithm. For the subproblem in each iteration,
chance constraints are transformed into equivalent deterministic ones via
sensitivity analysis, so that the subproblem can be efficiently solved by the
convex relaxation method. The proposed method is verified on the modified IEEE
33-bus system and the results show that PFRs make a significant contribution to
mitigating the voltage volatility and make the system operate in a more
economic and secure way.

how much hardware resource requirements will increase.
  In this paper, we propose an extension of the RVCoreP soft processor (which

understanding of real-world networks whose topology evolves with time.
Traditionally, the focus has been on the classic sequential, centralized
setting where the main quality measure of an algorithm is its update time, i.e.
the time needed to restore the solution after each update. While real-life
networks are very often distributed across multiple machines, the fundamental
question of finding efficient dynamic, distributed graph algorithms received
little attention to date. The goal in this setting is to optimize both the
round and message complexities incurred per update step, ideally achieving a
message complexity that matches the centralized update time in $O(1)$ (perhaps
amortized) rounds.
  Toward initiating a systematic study of dynamic, distributed algorithms, we
study some of the most central symmetry-breaking problems: maximal independent
set (MIS), maximal matching/(approx-) maximum cardinality matching (MM/MCM),
and $(\Delta + 1)$-vertex coloring. This paper focuses on dynamic, distributed
algorithms that are deterministic, and in particular -- robust against an
adaptive adversary. Most of our focus is on our MIS algorithm, which achieves
$O\left(m^{2/3}\log^2 n\right)$ amortized messages in $O\left(\log^2 n\right)$

disequilibrium chemistry in the middle and upper atmosphere. Our understanding
of atmospheric escape and chemistry, therefore, depends on our knowledge of the
stellar UV fluxes. While the far-ultraviolet fluxes can be observed for some
stars, most of the EUV range is unobservable due to the lack of a space
telescope with EUV capabilities and, for the more distant stars, to
interstellar medium absorption. Thus, it becomes essential to have indirect

involves a challenging combinatorial optimization problem. Recent work has
shown that any joint Probability Mass Function (PMF) can be represented as a
naive Bayes model, via Canonical Polyadic (tensor rank) Decomposition. In this
paper, we introduce a low-rank tensor model of the joint PMF of all variables

classification performance for a given number of features. Through low-rank
modeling of the joint PMF, it is possible to circumvent the curse of
dimensionality by learning principal components of the joint distribution. By
indirectly aiming to predict the latent variable of the naive Bayes model
instead of the original target variable, it is possible to formulate the
feature selection problem as maximization of a monotone submodular function
subject to a cardinality constraint - which can be tackled using a greedy
algorithm that comes with performance guarantees. Numerical experiments with

However, controlling the strain, or more practically, monitoring the strain in

photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and Raman spectroscopy have been proved to

that WS2 still follows continuum mechanics on the microscale and that strain
generates a non-uniform bandgap distribution even in a single WS2 flake through
a simple strain engineering. It is shown that these flakes could be useful in
optoelectonic applications as they become micron-sized PL emitters with a band
gap that can be tuned by the application of external strain to the substrate.
The analysis of strain distributions using Raman spectroscopy is further

optimization algorithm is exploited to find the locus of the beam tip. With the
derived locus of the beam tip, the deflection curve of the cantilever beam can
be calculated. The optimization algorithm in this paper is embodied in a
particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Experimental results show that the
proposed method can precisely predict the deflection of the uniform and

the parameters is limited. In many such cases, the use of asymptotic normality
of analytical modifications of the signed likelihood root is known to recover
inferential performance. It is proved here that parametric bootstrap of
standard likelihood pivots results in as accurate inferences as analytical
modifications of the signed likelihood root do in stratified models with
stratum specific nuisance parameters. We focus on the challenging case where
the number of strata increases as fast or faster than the stratum samples size.
It is also shown that this equivalence holds regardless of whether constrained

that constrained bootstrap corrects inference to a higher order than
unconstrained bootstrap. Simulation experiments support the theoretical

interactions for an effective spin model for chiral magnetic metals. By
variational calculations for both cases with triple and quadruple
superpositions, we find that the hedgehog lattices, which are stable in the
isotropic case, are deformed by the anisotropy, and eventually changed into
other spin textures with reduced dimension, such as helices and vortices. We
also clarify the changes of topological properties by tracing the real-space
positions of magnetic monopoles and antimonopoles as well as the emergent
magnetic field generated by the noncoplanar spin textures. Our results suggest
possible control of the topological spin textures, e.g., by uniaxial pressure
and chemical substitution in chiral materials.

inputs such as trimap or scribbles. To resolve these problems, we study the
distinct roles of semantics and details for image matting and decompose the
task into two parallel sub-tasks: high-level semantic segmentation and
low-level details matting. Specifically, we propose a novel Glance and Focus
Matting network (GFM), which employs a shared encoder and two separate decoders
to learn both tasks in a collaborative manner for end-to-end natural image
matting. Besides, due to the limitation of available natural images in the
matting task, previous methods typically adopt composite images for training
and evaluation, which result in limited generalization ability on real-world
images. In this paper, we investigate the domain gap issue between composite
images and real-world images systematically by conducting comprehensive
analyses of various discrepancies between the foreground and background images.
We find that a carefully designed composition route RSSN that aims to reduce
the discrepancies can lead to a better model with remarkable generalization
ability. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark containing 2,000 high-resolution
real-world animal images and 10,000 portrait images along with their manually
labeled alpha mattes to serve as a test bed for evaluating matting model's
generalization ability on real-world images. Comprehensive empirical studies
have demonstrated that GFM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and effectively
reduces the generalization error. The code and the datasets will be released at

and experimental fronts. It is well established that it is unbound and the
resonance parameters are fairly well-known. The theoretical analysis may
involved two- and three-body interactions, as well as correlations with the
continuum spectrum of energy. In order to properly assess the structure of the
ground and excited states, it is imperative to include a large single particle
representation with the right asymptotic behavior. The purpose of this work is
to provide details of the single particle continuum configurations of the
ground and excited $0^+$ states. We use a large complex energy single particle
basis, formed by resonances and complex energy scattering states, the so called
Berggren basis, and a separable interaction, which is convenient to solve in a
large model space. Three $0^+$ states were found in the complex energy plane.
Changes of the resonant parameters, i.e. energy and width, were analyzed as a
function of strength of the residual interaction. It is shown how a subtle
difference in the interaction could change the unbound character of $^{26}$O
into a Borromean nucleus. Only one of the two excited states can be considered
as a candidate for a physical meaningful resonance. The calculated occupation
probabilities are in agreement with other theoretical approaches although the
calculated half live is three-order of magnitude smaller than the experimental
one.

series. It employs two segmentation neural networks. The first network is used
to segment the anatomical structures such as the myocardium and left
ventricular cavity. The second network is used to segment the pathological
areas such as myocardial infarction, myocardial no-reflow, and normal
myocardial region. The segmented myocardium region from the first network is
further used to refine the second network's pathological segmentation results.
The second task is to automatically classify a given case into normal or
pathological from clinical information with or without DE-MRI. A cascaded
support vector machine (SVM) is employed to classify a given case from its
associated clinical information. The segmented pathological areas from DE-MRI
are also used for the classification task. We evaluated our method on the 2020

traveling from one intersection to the next as waves. The phase angle and
frequency of each wave map to its position and velocity, respectively. The goal
is to synchronize traffic such that intersecting traffic waves are out of phase
at every intersection. This ensures the safe collective navigation of
intersections. Vehicles share their phase angles through the V2X
infrastructure, and synchronize these angles using the Kuramoto equation. This
is a classical model for the self-synchronization of coupled oscillators. The
mapping between phase and location for vehicles on different roads is designed
such that Kuramoto synchronization ensures safe intersection navigation. Each
vehicle uses a constrained optimal control policy to achieve its desired target
Kuramoto phase at the upcoming intersection. The overall outcome is a
distributed traffic synchronization algorithm that simultaneously tackles two
challenges traditionally addressed independently, namely: coordinating crossing
at an individual intersection, and harmonizing traffic flow between adjacent
intersections. Simulation studies highlight the positive impact of this
strategy on fuel consumption and traffic delay time, compared to a network with

mono-energetic electron from the conversion process in a 1-T solenoidal
magnetic field. A highly intense muon source is applied to reach unprecedented
experimental sensitivity. It also generates undesirable background particles,
and a trigger rate due to these particles is expected to be much higher than an
acceptable trigger rate in the data acquisition system. By using hit
information from the drift chamber too, the online trigger system efficiently
suppresses a background trigger rate while keeping signal-event acceptance
large. A characteristic of this system is the utilization of the machine
learning technique in the form of look-up tables on hardware. An initial
simulation study indicates that the signal-event acceptance of the online
trigger is 96% while the background trigger rate is reduced from over
$90\,\mathrm{kHz}$ to $13\,\mathrm{kHz}$. For this scenario, we have produced
trigger-related electronics that construct a distributed trigger architecture.

cyclodextrines in slide-ring gels. We find that SLs entropically compete with
knots and can localise them, greatly facilitating their downstream
simplification by transient strand-crossing. We further show that the
efficiency of knot localisation strongly depends on the topology of the SL
network and, informed by our findings, discuss potential strategies to control
the topology of biological and synthetic materials.

for advanced medical data analysis.
  Our study case is a problem with high social impact: clinically-feasible
Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF). MRF is a new, quantitative, imaging
technique that replaces multiple qualitative Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
exams with a single, reproducible measurement for increased sensitivity and
efficiency. A fast acquisition is followed by a pattern matching (PM) task,
where signal responses are matched to entries from a dictionary of simulated,
physically-feasible responses, yielding multiple tissue parameters
simultaneously. Each pixel signal response in the volume is compared through
scalar products with all dictionary entries to choose the best measurement
reproduction. MRF is limited by the PM processing time, which scales
exponentially with the dictionary dimensionality, i.e. with the number of
tissue parameters to be reconstructed. We developed for HEP a powerful,
compact, embedded system, optimized for extremely fast PM. This system executes
real-time tracking for online event selection in the HEP experiments,
exploiting maximum parallelism and pipelining. Track reconstruction is executed
in two steps. The Associative Memory (AM) ASIC first implements a PM algorithm
by recognizing track candidates at low resolution. The second step, which is
implemented into FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays), refines the AM output
finding the track parameters at full resolution.
  We propose to use this system to perform MRF, to achieve clinically
reasonable reconstruction time. This paper proposes an adaptation of the HEP
system for medical imaging and shows some preliminary results.

software pipelines are needed for radio frequency interference (RFI)

calibration package, in particular on the times needed to obtain calibration
solutions. This is an important aspect, since this package is now used for the
Epoch of Reionization (EoR) Key Science Project of LOFAR, but will also have to
run optimally on SKA1 LOW. In terms of number of stations used for observing
this amounts to a factor 10 increase, from 51 to 512 stations. Consequentially,

investigate the scaling behaviour of SAGECal, whose runtimes should ideally
scale linearly with the number of stations. We also explain the algorithms

superconducting elliptical cavities. When the facility is running, the cavities
are fed with electrical field from klystrons. Parameters of this field are
monitored and controlled by the Low-Level Radio Frequency (LLRF) system. Its
main goal is to keep the amplitude and phase at a given set-point. The LLRF
system is also responsible for the reference clock distribution.
  During machine operation the cavities are periodically experiencing strain
caused by the Lorentz force, appearing when the beam is passing through the
accelerating structures. Even small changes of the physical dimensions of the
cavity cause a shift of its resonance frequency. This phenomenon, called
detuning, causes significant power losses. It is actively compensated by the
LLRF control system, which can physically tune lengths of the accelerating
cavities with stepper motors (slow, coarse grained control) and piezoelements
(active compensation during operation state).
  The paper describes implementation and tests of the software supporting
various aspects of the LLRF system and cavities management. The Piezo Driver
management and monitoring tool is dedicated for piezo controller device. The LO
Distribution application is responsible for configuration of the local
oscillator. The Cavity Simulator tool was designed to provide access to
properties of the hardware device, emulating behaviour of elliptical cavities.

exploit the likelihood of noise to reveal the alien region of spliced objects,

Yebes Observatory and it is devoted to Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
and single dish observations since 2010. It has been covering frequency bands
between 2\,GHz and 90\,GHz in discontinuous and narrow windows in most of the
cases, to match the current needs of the European VLBI Network (EVN) and the
Global Millimeter VLBI Array (GMVA). Nanocosmos project, a European Union
funded synergy grant, opened the possibility to increase the instantaneous
frequency coverage to observe many molecular transitions with single tunnings
in single dish mode. This reduces the observing time and maximises the output
from the telescope. We present the technical specifications of the recently
installed 31.5-50 GHz (Q band) and 72-90.5 GHz (W band) receivers along with
the main characteristics of the telescope at these frequency ranges. We have
observed IRC+10216, CRL 2688 and CRL 618, which harbour a rich molecular
chemistry, to demonstrate the capabilities of the new instrumentation for
spectral observations in single dish mode. The results show the high
sensitivity of the telescope in the Q band. The spectrum of IRC+10126 offers a
signal to noise ratio never seen before for this source in this band. On the
other hand, the spectrum normalised by the continuum flux towards CRL\,618 in
the W band demonstrates that the 40~m radio telescope produces comparable
results to those from the IRAM 30~m radio telescope, although with a smaller
sensitivity. The new receivers fulfil one of the main goals of Nanocosmos and
open the possibility to study the spectrum of different astrophysical media
with unprecedented sensitivity.

return of hardware-supported low-precision computing. Computations with fewer
digits are faster and more memory and energy efficient, but can be extremely
susceptible to rounding errors. As shown by recent studies into
reduced-precision climate simulations, an application that can largely benefit
from the advantages of low-precision computing is the numerical solution of
partial differential equations (PDEs). However, a careful implementation and
rounding error analysis are required to ensure that sensible results can still
be obtained.
  In this paper we study the accumulation of rounding errors in the solution of
the heat equation, a proxy for parabolic PDEs, via Runge-Kutta finite
difference methods using round-to-nearest (RtN) and stochastic rounding (SR).
We demonstrate how to implement the scheme to reduce rounding errors and we
derive \emph{a priori} estimates for local and global rounding errors. Let $u$
be the unit roundoff. While the worst-case local errors are $O(u)$ with respect
to the discretization parameters (mesh size and timestep), the RtN and SR error
behavior is substantially different. In fact, the RtN solution always stagnates
for small enough $\Delta t$, and until stagnation the global error grows like
$O(u\Delta t^{-1})$. In contrast, we show that the leading-order errors
introduced by SR are zero-mean, independent in space and mean-independent in
time, making SR resilient to stagnation and rounding error accumulation. In
fact, we prove that for SR the global rounding errors are only $O(u\Delta
t^{-1/4})$ in 1D and are essentially bounded (up to logarithmic factors) in
higher dimensions.

conditions. Here we examine these processes in a sample of 24 strongly lensed
star-forming galaxies identified by the \textit{Planck} satellite (LPs) at z ~

CO and [CI] lines, and the dust continuum emission, using two different
non-LTE, radiative transfer models. The first model represents a two component
gas density, while the second assumes a turbulence driven log-normal gas
density distribution. These LPs are among the most gas-rich, infrared (IR)

$<T_{\rm kin}$/$T_{\rm d}> \sim 2.5$, sustained on scales larger than a few

correspond to systems whose antenna size is so large that conventional
assumptions, such as uniform plane wave (UPW) impingement, are no longer valid.
This paper studies the channel modelling and performance analysis of XL-MIMO
communication based on the generic spherical wavefront propagation model.
First, for the single-user uplink/downlink communication with the optimal
maximum ratio combining/transmission (MRC/MRT), we rigorously derive a new
closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which
includes the conventional SNR expression based on UPW assumption as a special
case. Our result shows that instead of scaling linearly with the base station
(BS) antenna number $M$, the SNR with the more generic spherical wavefront
model increases with $M$ with diminishing return, governed by a new parameter
called angular span. One important finding from our derivation is the necessity
to introduce a new distance criterion, termed critical distance, to complement
the classical Rayleigh distance for separating the near- and far-field
propagation regions. While Rayleigh distance is based on the phase difference
across array elements and hence depends on the electrical size of the antenna,
the critical distance cares about the amplitude/power difference and only
depends on its physical size. We then extend the study to the multi-user
XL-MIMO communication system, for which we demonstrate that inter-user
interference (IUI) can be mitigated not just by angle separation, but also by
distance separation along the same direction. This offers one new degree of
freedom (DoF) for interference suppression with XL-MIMO.

we show that such performance degradation due to choosing a high compression
ratio is not fundamental. An adaptive compression strategy can reduce
communication while maintaining final test accuracy. Inspired by recent
findings on critical learning regimes, in which small gradient errors can have
irrecoverable impact on model performance, we propose Accordion a simple yet
effective adaptive compression algorithm. While Accordion maintains a high
enough compression rate on average, it avoids over-compressing gradients
whenever in critical learning regimes, detected by a simple gradient-norm based
criterion. Our extensive experimental study over a number of machine learning
tasks in distributed environments indicates that Accordion, maintains similar
model accuracy to uncompressed training, yet achieves up to 5.5x better
compression and up to 4.1x end-to-end speedup over static approaches. We show
that Accordion also works for adjusting the batch size, another popular
strategy for alleviating communication bottlenecks.

the other. However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture
representations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages
such as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a
new approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level
representation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a
hierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering. Through
experiments on downstream tasks such as GLUE, SQuAD, and DiscoEval, we show
that this feature of our model improves the performance of the original BERT by
large margins.

scenarios is crucial for safely deploying intelligent autonomous systems in the
real-world environment. However, it remains a challenge due to the behavior of
a target agent being affected by other agents dynamically and there being more
than one socially possible paths the agent could take. In this paper, we
propose a novel framework, named Dynamic Context Encoder Network (DCENet). In
our framework, first, the spatial context between agents is explored by using
self-attention architectures. Then, the two-stream encoders are trained to
learn temporal context between steps by taking the respective observed
trajectories and the extracted dynamic spatial context as input. The
spatial-temporal context is encoded into a latent space using a Conditional
Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE) module. Finally, a set of future trajectories
for each agent is predicted conditioned on the learned spatial-temporal context
by sampling from the latent space, repeatedly. DCENet is evaluated on one of
the most popular challenging benchmarks for trajectory forecasting Trajnet and
reports a new state-of-the-art performance. It also demonstrates superior
performance evaluated on the benchmark inD for mixed traffic at intersections.
A series of ablation studies is conducted to validate the effectiveness of each
proposed module. Our code is available at https://github.com/wtliao/DCENet.

invariant to camera viewpoint changes or zooms, which means feature matching
can identify similar objects under different camera viewpoints. We can compare
the 3D feature maps of two objects by searching alignment across scales and 3D
rotations, and, as a result of the operation, we can estimate pose and scale
changes without the need for 3D pose annotations. We cluster object feature
maps into a set of 3D prototypes that represent familiar objects in canonical
scales and orientations. We then parse images by inferring the prototype
identity and 3D pose for each detected object. We compare our method to
numerous baselines that do not learn 3D feature visual representations or do
not attempt to correspond features across scenes, and outperform them by a
large margin in the tasks of object retrieval and object pose estimation.
Thanks to the 3D nature of the object-centric feature maps, the visual

examine the sensitivity of future $0\nu\beta\beta$-decay experiments to
neutrino masses and Majorana CP phases by following the Bayesian statistical
approach. Provided experimental setups corresponding to the sensitivity of
$|m^{}_{\beta\beta}| \simeq 1~{\rm meV}$, the null observation of
$0\nu\beta\beta$ decays in the case of normal neutrino mass ordering leads to a
very competitive bound on the lightest neutrino mass $m^{}_1$. Namely, the
$95\%$ credible interval turns out to be $1.6~{\rm meV} \lesssim m^{}_1
\lesssim 7.3~{\rm meV}$ or $0.3~{\rm meV} \lesssim m^{}_1 \lesssim 5.6~{\rm
meV}$ when the uniform prior on $m^{}_1/{\rm eV}$ or on
$\log^{}_{10}(m^{}_1/{\rm eV})$ is adopted. Moreover, one of two Majorana CP
phases is strictly constrained, i.e., $140^\circ \lesssim \rho \lesssim
220^\circ$ for both priors of $m^{}_1$. In contrast, if a relatively worse
sensitivity of $|m^{}_{\beta\beta}| \simeq 10~{\rm meV}$ is assumed, the
constraint becomes accordingly $0.6~{\rm meV} \lesssim m^{}_1 \lesssim 26~{\rm
meV}$ or $0 \lesssim m^{}_1 \lesssim 6.1~{\rm meV}$, while two Majorana CP
phases will be essentially unconstrained. In the same statistical framework,
the prospects for the determination of neutrino mass ordering and the
discrimination between Majorana and Dirac nature of massive neutrinos in the
$0\nu\beta\beta$-decay experiments are also discussed. Given the experimental
sensitivity of $|m^{}_{\beta\beta}| \simeq 10~{\rm meV}$ (or $1~{\rm meV}$),
the strength of evidence to exclude the Majorana nature under the null
observation of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decays is found to be inconclusive (or strong),
no matter which of two priors on $m^{}_1$ is taken.

critical field Bc ~ 8 T, at which the magnetic order is suppressed, a dramatic
increase of kappa_ab at all temperatures investigated. The analysis of our data
shows that the phonons are not only strongly scattered by a magnetic mode at
relatively large energy which scales roughly linearly with the magnetic field,
but also by a small-energy mode which emerges near Bc with a square-root-like
field dependence. While the former is in striking agreement with recent spin
wave theory (SWT) results of the magnetic excitation spectrum at the Gamma
point, the energy of the latter is too small to be compatible with the
SWT-expected magnon gap at the M point, despite the matching field dependence.
Therefore, an alternative scenario based on phonon scattering off the thermal
excitation of random-singlet states is proposed.

utilizes learned multiplicative layers. Both proposed transformation layers are
shown to clearly outperform the conventional baseline receiver, especially with
sparse pilot configurations. To the best of our knowledge, these are some of
the first results showing such high performance for a fully learned MIMO

produces propagules at a certain rate, and the propagules turn into the parent

delay, which reflects a finite time typically required for a new parent to
mature before it begins to produce propagules. While the FKPP process with
other types of delays have been considered in the past as a pure mathematical
construct, in our work a delay in the FKPP model arises in a natural science
setting. The speed of the resulting density fronts is shown to decrease with
increasing delay time, and has a non-trivial dependence on the rate of
conversion of propagules into the parent substance. Remarkably, the fronts in
this model are always slower than Fisher waves of the classical FKPP model. The
largest speed is half of the classical value, and it is achieved at zero delay

Second, we explored the potential of using only the power spectrum captured by

This latter work is based on a data-driven approach together with the
development of a data augmentation method based on attenuation, range and
speckle noise. Last, we created a new large-scale dataset in the ""wild"" with
many different weather scenarios (sunny, overcast, night, fog, rain and snow)

with increasing $s$ the ground-state magnetization as a function of the

  True or False?",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  According to a very popular belief - very widespread among non-scientific
communities - the exploitation of narrow beams, a.k.a. ""pencil beamforming"",
results in a prompt increase of exposure levels radiated by 5G Base Stations
(BSs). To face such concern with a scientific approach, in this work we propose
a novel localization-enhanced pencil beamforming technique, in which the
traffic beams are tuned in accordance with the uncertainty localization levels
of User Equipment (UE). Compared to currently deployed beamforming techniques,
which generally employ beams of fixed width, we exploit the localization
functionality made available by the 5G architecture to synthesize the direction
and the width of each pencil beam towards each served UE. We then evaluate the
effectiveness of pencil beamforming in terms of ElectroMagnetic Field (EMF)
exposure and UE throughput levels over different realistic case-studies.
Results, obtained from a publicly released open-source simulator, dispel the
myth: the adoption of localization-enhanced pencil beamforming triggers a
prompt reduction of exposure w.r.t. other alternative techniques, which include
e.g., beams of fixed width and cellular coverage not exploiting beamforming.
The EMF reduction is achieved not only for the UE that are served by the pencil
beams, but also over the whole territory (including the locations in proximity
to the 5G BS). In addition, large throughput levels - adequate for most of 5G
services - can be guaranteed when each UE is individually served by one
dedicated beam.

a planted uniform permutation and all pairs of edge weights $(A_{i,j},
B_{\pi^*(i),\pi^*(j)})_{1 \leq i<j \leq n}$ are i.i.d. pairs of Gaussian
variables with zero mean, unit variance and correlation parameter $\rho \in

if $n \rho^2 \geq (4+\epsilon) \log n + \omega(1)$ for some $\epsilon>0$, there
is an estimator $\hat{\pi}$ -- namely the MAP estimator -- based on the
observation of databases $A,B$ that achieves exact reconstruction with high
probability. Conversely, if $n \rho^2 \leq 4 \log n - \log \log n - \omega(1)$,
then any estimator $\hat{\pi}$ verifies $\hat{\pi}=\pi$ with probability
$o(1)$.
  This result shows that the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery
is the same as the one obtained for detection in a recent work by Wu et al.
(2020): in other words, for Gaussian weighted graph alignment, the problem of
reconstruction is not more difficult than that of detection. Though the
reconstruction task was already well understood for vector-shaped database
alignment (that is taking signal of the form $(u_i, v_{\pi^*(i)})_{1 \leq i\leq
n}$ where $(u_i, v_{\pi^*(i)})$ are i.i.d. pairs in $\mathbb{R}^{d_u} \times
\mathbb{R}^{d_v}$), its formulation for graph (or matrix) databases brings a
drastically different problem for which the hard phase is conjectured to be
wide.

  Issue 2, Article 10","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2021/5/10",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: Actor-based programming languages offer many essential features for
developing modern distributed reactive systems. These systems exploit the actor
model's isolation property to fulfill their performance and scalability
demands. Unfortunately, the reliance of the model on isolation as its most
fundamental property requires programmers to express complex interaction
patterns between their actors to be expressed manually in terms of complex
combinations of messages sent between the isolated actors.
  Inquiry: In the last three decades, several language design proposals have
been introduced to reduce the complexity that emerges from describing said
interaction and coordination of actors. We argue that none of these proposals
is satisfactory in order to express the many complex interaction patterns
between actors found in modern reactive distributed systems.
  Approach: We describe seven smart home automation scenarios (in which an
actor represents every smart home appliance) to motivate the support by actor
languages for five radically different types of message synchronization
patterns, which are lacking in modern distributed actor-based languages.
Fortunately, these five types of synchronisation patterns have been studied
extensively by the Complex Event Processing (CEP) community. Our paper
describes how such CEP patterns are elegantly added to an actor-based
programming language.
  Knowledge: Based on our findings, we propose an extension of the
single-message matching paradigm of contemporary actor-based languages in order
to support a multiple-message matching way of thinking in the same way as
proposed by CEP languages. Our proposal thus enriches the actor-model by ways
of declaratively describing complex message combinations to which an actor can
respond.
  Grounding: We base the problem-statement of the paper on an online poll in
the home automation community that has motivated the real need for the
CEP-based synchronisation operators between actors proposed in the paper.
Furthermore, we implemented a DSL -- called Sparrow -- that supports said
operators and we argue quantitatively (in terms of LOC and in terms of a
reduction of the concerns that have to be handled by programmers) that the DSL
outperforms existing approaches.
  Importance: This work aims to provide a set of synchronization operators that
help actor-based languages to handle the complex interaction required by modern
reactive distributed systems. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the
first one to add advanced CEP synchronization operators to the -- relatively
simplistic single-message based matching -- mechanisms of most actor-based
languages.

conduct an experiment in ?type-driven algorithm design?: we develop algorithms
from their specifications encoded in sophisticated types, to see how useful the
hints provided by a type-aware interactive development environment can be. The
algorithmic problem we choose is metamorphisms, whose definitional behaviour is
consuming a data structure to compute an intermediate value and then producing
a codata structure from that value, but there are other ways to compute
metamorphisms. We develop Gibbons?s streaming algorithm and Nakano?s jigsaw
model in the interactive development environment provided by the dependently
typed language Agda, turning intuitive ideas about these algorithms into formal
conditions and programs that are correct by construction.

side and the server side of a web application in isolation from each other.
Such testers lack a whole-program perspective on the web application under
test.
  Inquiry: We hypothesise that an additional whole-program perspective would
enable the tester to discover which server side errors can be triggered by an
actual end user accessing the application through the client, and which ones
can only be triggered in hypothetical scenarios.
  Approach: In this paper, we explore the idea of employing such a
whole-program perspective in testing. To this end, we develop , a novel
concolic tester which operates on full-stack JavaScript web applications, where
both the client and the server side are JavaScript processes communicating via
asynchronous messages -- as enabled by the WebSocket or Socket.IO-libraries.
  Knowledge: We find that the whole-program perspective enables discerning
high-priority errors, which are reachable from a particular client, from
low-priority errors, which are not accessible through the tested client.
Another benefit of the perspective is that it allows the automated tester to
construct practical, step-by-step scenarios for triggering server side errors
from the end user's perspective.
  Grounding: We apply on a collection of web applications to evaluate how
effective testing is in distinguishing between high- and low-priority errors.
The results show that correctly classifies the majority of server errors.
  Importance: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of testing as a novel
approach for automatically testing web applications. Classifying errors as
being of high or low importance aids developers in prioritising bugs that might
be encountered by users, and postponing the diagnosis of bugs that are less
easily reached.

  Issue 2, Article 8","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2021/5/8",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, heterogeneous computing has emerged as the vital way to
increase computers? performance and energy efficiency by combining diverse
hardware devices, such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and Field
Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). The rationale behind this trend is that
different parts of an application can be offloaded from the main CPU to diverse
devices, which can efficiently execute these parts as co-processors. FPGAs are
a subset of the most widely used co-processors, typically used for accelerating
specific workloads due to their flexible hardware and energy-efficient
characteristics. These characteristics have made them prevalent in a broad
spectrum of computing systems ranging from low-power embedded systems to
high-end data centers and cloud infrastructures.
  However, these hardware characteristics come at the cost of programmability.
Developers who create their applications using high-level programming languages
(e.g., Java, Python, etc.) are required to familiarize with a hardware
description language (e.g., VHDL, Verilog) or recently heterogeneous
programming models (e.g., OpenCL, HLS) in order to exploit the co-processors?
capacity and tune the performance of their applications. Currently, the
above-mentioned heterogeneous programming models support exclusively the
compilation from compiled languages, such as C and C++. Thus, the transparent
integration of heterogeneous co-processors to the software ecosystem of managed
programming languages (e.g. Java, Python) is not seamless.
  In this paper we rethink the engineering trade-offs that we encountered, in
terms of transparency and compilation overheads, while integrating FPGAs into
high-level managed programming languages. We present a novel approach that
enables runtime code specialization techniques for seamless and
high-performance execution of Java programs on FPGAs. The proposed solution is
prototyped in the context of the Java programming language and TornadoVM; an
open-source programming framework for Java execution on heterogeneous hardware.
Finally, we evaluate the proposed solution for FPGA execution against both

19.8x performance speedups, respectively, and up to 13.82x compared to
TornadoVM running on an Intel integrated GPU. We also provide a break-down

property-based testing (PBT) libraries for many languages and the process is
getting increasing attention. However, unlike regular testing, PBT is not
widespread in collegiate curricula. Furthermore, the value of PBT is not
limited to software testing. The growing use of formal methods in, and the
growth of software synthesis, all create demand for techniques to train
students and developers in the art of specification writing. We posit that PBT
forms a strong bridge between testing and the act of specification: it's a form
of testing where the tester is actually writing abstract specifications.
  Inquiry: Even well-informed technologists mention the difficulty of finding
good motivating examples for its use. We take steps to fill this lacuna.
  Approach & Knowledge: We find that the use of ""relational"" problems -- those
for which an input may admit multiple valid outputs -- easily motivates the use
of PBT. We also notice that such problems are readily available in the computer
science pantheon of problems (e.g., many graph and sorting algorithms). We have
been using these for some years now to teach PBT in collegiate courses.
  Grounding: In this paper, we describe the problems we use and report on
students? completion of them. We believe the problems overcome some of the
motivation issues described above. We also show that students can do quite well
at PBT for these problems, suggesting that the topic is well within their
reach. In the process, we introduce a simple method to evaluate the accuracy of
their specifications, and use it to characterize their common mistakes.
  Importance: Based on our findings, we believe that relational problems are an
underutilized motivating example for PBT. We hope this paper initiates a
catalog of such problems for educators (and developers) to use, and also
provides a concrete (though by no means exclusive) method to analyze the

  Issue 2, Article 11","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2021/5/11",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Context: An island parser reads an input text and builds the parse (or
abstract syntax) tree of only the programming constructs of interest in the
text. These constructs are called islands and the rest of the text is called
water, which the parser ignores and skips over. Since an island parser does not
have to parse all the details of the input, it is often easy to develop but
still useful enough for a number of software engineering tools. When a parser
generator is used, the developer can implement an island parser by just
describing a small number of grammar rules, for example, in Parsing Expression
Grammar (PEG).
  Inquiry: In practice, however, the grammar rules are often complicated since
the developer must define the water inside the island; otherwise, the island
parsing will not reduce the total number of grammar rules. When describing the
grammar rules for such water, the developer must consider other rules and
enumerate a set of symbols, which we call alternative symbols. Due to this
difficulty, island parsing seems to be not widely used today despite its
usefulness in many applications.
  Approach: This paper proposes the lake symbols for addressing this difficulty
in developing an island parser. It also presents an extension to PEG for
supporting the lake symbols. The lake symbols automate the enumeration of the
alternative symbols for the water inside an island. The paper proposes an
algorithm for translating the extended PEG to the normal PEG, which can be
given to an existing parser generator based on PEG.
  Knowledge: The user can use lake symbols to define water without specifying
each alternative symbol. Our algorithms can calculate all alternative symbols
for a lake symbol, based on where the lake symbol is used in the grammar.
  Grounding: We implemented a parser generator accepting our extended PEG and
implemented 36 island parsers for Java and 20 island parsers for Python. Our
experiments show that the lake symbols reduce 42 % of grammar rules for Java
and 89 % of rules for Python on average, excluding the case where islands are
expressions.
  Importance: This work eases the use of island parsing. Lake symbols enable
the user to define the water inside the island simpler than before. Defining
water inside the island is essential to apply island parsing for practical
programming languages.

DARPA Urban Challenge vehicles, Google's self-driving cars, and various others
from auto manufacturers. These vehicles have the potential to significantly
reduce crashes and improve roadway efficiency by automating the
responsibilities of the driver. Still, automated vehicles are expected to crash
occasionally, even when all sensors, vehicle control components, and algorithms
function perfectly. If a human driver is unable to take control in time, a
computer will be responsible for pre-crash behavior. Unlike other automated
vehicles--such as aircraft, where every collision is catastrophic, and guided
track systems, which can only avoid collisions in one dimension--automated
roadway vehicles can predict various crash trajectory alternatives and select a
path with the lowest damage or likelihood of collision. In some situations, the
preferred path may be ambiguous. This study investigates automated vehicle
crashing and concludes the following: (1) automated vehicles will almost
certainly crash, (2) an automated vehicle's decisions preceding certain crashes
will have a moral component, and (3) there is no obvious way to effectively
encode complex human morals in software. A three-phase approach to developing
ethical crashing algorithms is presented, consisting of a rational approach, an
artificial intelligence approach, and a natural language requirement. The
phases are theoretical and should be implemented as the technology becomes

algorithms has made progress in solving linear systems whose coefficient matrix
is the Laplacian matrix of a weighted graph. The solution of the linear system
can be interpreted as the potentials of an electrical flow. Kelner, Orrechia,
Sidford, and Zhu (STOC 2013) give a combinatorial, near-linear time algorithm
that maintains the Kirchoff Current Law, and gradually enforces the Kirchoff
Potential Law by updating flows around cycles (cycle toggling). In this paper,
we consider a dual version of the algorithm that maintains the Kirchoff
Potential Law, and gradually enforces the Kirchoff Current Law by cut toggling:
each iteration updates all potentials on one side of a fundamental cut of a
spanning tree by the same amount. We prove that this dual algorithm also runs
in a near-linear number of iterations.
  We show, however, that if we abstract cut toggling as a natural data
structure problem, this problem can be reduced to the online
vector-matrix-vector problem, which has been conjectured to be difficult for
dynamic algorithms by Henzinger, Krinninger, Nanongkai, and Saranurak (STOC
2015). The conjecture implies that a straightforward implementation of the
cut-toggling algorithm requires essentially linear time per iteration. To
circumvent the lower bound, we batch update steps, and perform them
simultaneously instead of sequentially. An appropriate choice of batching leads
to an $\tilde{O}(m^{1.5})$ time cut-toggling algorithm for solving Laplacian
systems. Furthermore, if we sparsify the graph and call our algorithm
recursively on the Laplacian system implied by batching and sparsifying, the
running time can be reduced to $O(m^{1+\epsilon})$ for any $\epsilon > 0$.
Thus, the dual cut-toggling algorithm can achieve (almost) the same running
time as its primal cycle-toggling counterpart.

numerical scheme for certain type reaction-diffusion systems involving the Law
of Mass Action with the detailed balance condition. The numerical scheme is
constructed based on a recently developed energetic variational formulation, in
which the reaction part is reformulated in terms of reaction trajectories. The
fact that both the reaction and the diffusion parts dissipate the same free
energy opens a path of an energy stable, operator splitting scheme for these
systems. At the reaction stage, we solve equations of reaction trajectories by
treating all the logarithmic terms in the reformulated form implicitly due to
their convex nature. The positivity-preserving property and unique solvability
can be theoretically proved, based on the singular behavior of the logarithmic
function around the limiting value. Moreover, the energy stability of this
scheme at the reaction stage can be proved by a careful convexity analysis.
Similar techniques are used to establish the positivity-preserving property and
energy stability for the standard semi-implicit solver at the diffusion stage.
As a result, a combination of these two stages leads to a positivity-preserving
and energy-stable numerical scheme for the original reaction-diffusion system.
To our best knowledge, it is the first time to report an
energy-dissipation-law-based operator splitting scheme to a nonlinear PDE with
variational structures. Several numerical examples are presented to demonstrate
the robustness of the proposed operator splitting scheme.

rapidly identify optimal parameters for intranasal delivery. In this study, we
have applied computational fluid dynamics to simulate fluid flow through the
nasal cavity and examined particle deposition for a drug formulation, mimicking
different delivery methods. The nasal geometry models were derived using
digitized and meshed computed tomography (CT) scans of human patients. Using
the nasal geometries, we simulated two different airflows: a laminar model at
15 LPM (Liters/min) that simulated resting breathing rate and a Large Eddy
Simulation (LES) model used to achieve a higher flow rate of 30 LPM. We were
able to run particle tracking simulations for these two airflow schemes to test
different drug properties such as particle size. The different injection
methods used include surface injection which best replicates an inhaler-based
release of particle droplets into the nostril and the cone injection method
which best replicates a spray into the nostril. The results of the study
suggest that the most optimal drug particle size for targeting the intranasal

binary black hole populations formed through isolated binary evolution. We
investigate the impact of mass-accretion efficiency onto compact objects and
common-envelope efficiency on the observed distributions of $\chi_{eff}$,
$M_{chirp}$ and $q$. We find that low common envelope efficiency translates to
tighter orbits post common envelope and therefore more tidally spun up
second-born black holes. However, these systems have short merger timescales
and are only marginally detectable by current gravitational-waves detectors as
they form and merge at high redshifts ($z\sim 2$), outside current detector
horizons. Assuming Eddington-limited accretion efficiency and that the
first-born black hole is formed with a negligible spin, we find that all
non-zero $\chi_{eff}$ systems in the detectable population can come only from
the common envelope channel as the stable mass-transfer channel cannot shrink
the orbits enough for efficient tidal spin-up to take place. We find the local
rate density ($z\simeq 0.01$) for the common envelope channel is in the range
$\sim 17-113~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ considering a range of $\alpha_{CE} \in
[0.2,5.0]$ while for the stable mass transfer channel the rate density is $\sim
25~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$. The latter drops by two orders of magnitude if the mass
accretion onto the black hole is not Eddington limited because conservative
mass transfer does not shrink the orbit as efficiently as non-conservative mass
transfer does. Finally, using GWTC-2 events, we constrain the lower bound of
branching fraction from other formation channels in the detected population to
be $\sim 0.2$. Assuming all remaining events to be formed through either stable
mass transfer or common envelope channels, we find moderate to strong evidence
in favour of models with inefficient common envelopes.

cloud, overcoming local hardware and energy limitations. However, offloading
adds communication delay, thus increasing the overall inference time, and hence
it should be used only when needed. An approach to address this problem
consists of the use of adaptive model partitioning based on early-exit DNNs.
Accordingly, the inference starts at the mobile device, and an intermediate
layer estimates the accuracy: If the estimated accuracy is sufficient, the
device takes the inference decision; Otherwise, the remaining layers of the DNN
run at the cloud. Thus, the device offloads the inference to the cloud only if
it cannot classify a sample with high confidence. This offloading requires a
correct accuracy prediction at the device. Nevertheless, DNNs are typically
miscalibrated, providing overconfident decisions. This work shows that the
employment of a miscalibrated early-exit DNN for offloading via model
partitioning can significantly decrease inference accuracy. In contrast, we
argue that implementing a calibration algorithm prior to deployment can solve
this problem, allowing for more reliable offloading decisions.

case where all these squares are isotopic to Cayley tables of groups, and give
an example to show the groups need not be all isomorphic. For $m>2$, things are
more restricted. Any $m+1$ of the partitions generate a join-semilattice
admitting a diagonal group over a group $G$. It may be that the groups are all
isomorphic, though we cannot prove this. Under an extra hypothesis, we show
that $G$ must be abelian and must have three fixed-point-free automorphisms
whose product is the identity. Under this hypothesis, such a structure gives an
orthogonal array, and conversely in some cases.
  If the group is cyclic of prime order $p$, then the structure corresponds
exactly to an arc of cardinality $m+r$ in the $(m-1)$-dimensional projective
space over the field with $p$ elements, so all known results about arcs are

new emerging area uses elements of classical communication systems and maps it
to molecular signalling and communication found inside and outside the body,
where the aim is to develop new tools that can serve future medicine. In this
paper, we provide an extensive and detailed discussion on how Molecular
Communications can be integrated into the research on viral infectious diseases
modelling, and how possible treatment and vaccines can be developed considering
molecules as information carriers. We provide a literature review on the
existing models of Molecular Communications for viral infection (in-body and
out-body), a deep analysis on their effects on the host and subsequent
communication process for other systems within the body (e.g., immune
response), sources of experimental data on known viral infections and how it
can be used by the Molecular Communications community, as well as open issues

interdisciplinary approach centred around ICT, we are confident that Molecular
Communications can play a central role here by providing a detail

strong magnetic field is formed. There are several studies of the effects of
this field, where $\vec{B}$ is calculated with the expressions of classical
electrodynamics. A quantum field may be approximated by a classical one when
the number of field quanta in each field mode is sufficiently high. This may
happen if the field sources are intense enough. In heavy ion physics the
validity of the classical treatment was not investigated. In this work we
propose a test of the quality of the classical approximation. We calculate an
observable quantity using the classical magnetic field and also using photons
as input. If the results of both approaches coincide, this will be an
indication that the classical approximation is valid. More precisely, we focus
on the process in which a nucleon is converted into a delta resonance, which
then decays into another nucleon and a pion, i.e., $ N \to \Delta \to N' \pi$.
In ultra-peripheral relativistic heavy ion collisions this conversion can be
induced by the classical magnetic field of one the ions acting on the other
ion. Alternatively, we can replace the classical magnetic field by a flux of
equivalent photons, which are absorbed by the target nucleons. We calculate the
cross sections in these two independent ways and find that they differ from
each other by $\simeq 10$ \% in the considered collision energy range. This
suggests that the two formalisms are equivalent and that the classical
approximation for the magnetic field is reasonable.

precoding. The key innovation of our distributed precoding method is to
maximize the product of SILNRs of users per cell using local channel state
information at the transmitter (CSIT). We show that our precoding technique
only using local CSIT can asymptotically achieve the multi-cell cooperative
bound attained by cooperative precoding using global CSIT in some cases. We
also present a precoding algorithm that is robust to CSIT errors in multi-cell

characterise the optimal wealth process, showing that optimal deflated wealth

This paper presents an experimental web-based decision support system, which

decision optimization algorithms in controlled environment. A user of the
system (either human or AI) controls the decisions to steer the well or stop

To enable informed decisions the system is equipped with functionality to

the objectives of the current experiment.
  To illustrate the utility of the system as a benchmark, we present the

double-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided system over the conventional
single-IRS counterpart, channel state information (CSI) is indispensable in
practice but also more challenging to acquire, due to the presence of not only
the single- but also double-reflection links that are intricately coupled and
also entail more channel coefficients for estimation. In this paper, we propose
a new and efficient channel estimation scheme for the double-IRS aided

resolve the cascaded CSI of both its single- and double-reflection links.
First, for the single-user case, the single- and double-reflection channels are
efficiently estimated at the multi-antenna base station (BS) with both the IRSs
turned ON (for maximal signal reflection), by exploiting the fact that their
cascaded channel coefficients are scaled versions of their superimposed
lower-dimensional CSI. Then, the proposed channel estimation scheme is extended
to the multi-user case, where given an arbitrary user's cascaded channel
(estimated as in the single-user case), the other users' cascaded channels can
also be expressed as lower-dimensional scaled versions of it and thus
efficiently estimated at the BS. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of
the proposed channel estimation scheme and joint training reflection design for
double IRSs, as compared to various benchmark schemes.

and eliciting feedback. These vision videos show scenarios of a system vision.
In this way, the videos serve all parties involved as a visual reference point
to actively disclose, discuss, and align their mental models of the future
system to achieve shared understanding. In the joint project TrUSD, we had
planned to conduct such an on-site focus group using a vision video to validate
a scenario of a future software tool, the so-called Privacy Dashboard. However,
the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated measures led to an increase in home
and remote working, which also affected us. Therefore, we had to replan and
conduct the focus group virtually. In this paper, we report about our
experiences and recommendations for the use of vision videos in virtual focus
groups.

similar to those occurring on Earth, but with greater effects over a shorter

self-existing oscillations, parametric resonances appear caused by a small
periodic term; such is the case of fluids subjected to small periodic
variations in gravitational forces in microscopic or mesoscopic plant channels
filled with sap and air-vapor. The interface instabilities verify a Mathieu's
second order differential equation resulting from a Rayleigh-Taylor stability
model. These instabilities appear during the Moon's rotation around the Earth
and during the revolution of the International Space Station. They create
impulses of pressure and sap movements in the network of roots, stems and
leaves. The model can explain the effects of the lunar tide on plant growth.
The eccentricity of the lunar orbit around the Earth creates an important
difference between the apogee and perigee of the Moon's trajectory and
therefore the tidal effects can depend on the distance between the Moon and the
Earth.

instituting lockdowns have been widely applied around the world to control the
current COVID-19 pandemic. Typically, this type of intervention is imposed when
an epidemiological indicator in a given population exceeds a certain threshold.
Then, the nonpharmaceutical intervention is lifted when the levels of the
indicator used have decreased sufficiently. What is the best indicator to use?
In this paper, we propose a mathematical framework to try to answer this
question. More specifically, the proposed framework permits to assess and
compare different event-triggered controls based on epidemiological indicators.
Our methodology consists of considering some outcomes that are consequences of
the nonpharmaceutical interventions that a decision maker aims to make as low
as possible. The peak demand for intensive care units (ICU) and the total
number of days in lockdown are examples of such outcomes. If an epidemiological
indicator is used to trigger the interventions, there is naturally a trade-off
between the outcomes that can be seen as a curve parameterized by the trigger
threshold to be used. The computation of these curves for a group of indicators
then allows the selection of the best indicator the curve of which dominates
the curves of the other indicators. This methodology is illustrated using
indicators in the context of COVID-19 using deterministic compartmental models
in discrete-time, although the framework can be adapted for a larger class of
models.

related restrictions on mobility of people and goods, swift opening of the

report, we use the IISc-TIFR agent based simulator to develop long term
projections for Mumbai under realistic scenarios related to Mumbai's opening of
the workplaces, or equivalently, the economy, and the associated public
transportation through local trains and buses. These projections were developed
taking into account a possible second wave if the economy and the local trains
are fully opened either on November 1, 2020 or on January 1, 2021. The impact

is manageable provided reasonable medical infrastructure is in place. Further,
schools and colleges opening in January do not lead to excessive increase in
infections.

relevance weighting is achieved using a sub-network approach that performs the
task of feature selection. A relevance sub-network, applied on the output of
first layer of a convolutional neural network model operating on raw speech
signals, acts as an acoustic filterbank (FB) layer with relevance weighting. A
similar relevance sub-network applied on the second convolutional layer
performs modulation filterbank learning with relevance weighting. The full

feed-forward layers is trained for a speech recognition task on noisy and
reverberant speech in the Aurora-4, CHiME-3 and VOiCES datasets. The proposed

  Information",,,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Huge overhead of beam training poses a significant challenge to mmWave
communications. To address this issue, beam tracking has been widely
investigated whereas existing methods are hard to handle serious multipath
interference and non-stationary scenarios. Inspired by the spatial similarity
between low-frequency and mmWave channels in non-standalone architectures, this
paper proposes to utilize prior low-frequency information to predict the
optimal mmWave beam, where deep learning is adopted to enhance the prediction
accuracy. Specifically, periodically estimated low-frequency channel state
information (CSI) is applied to track the movement of user equipment, and
timing offset indicator is proposed to indicate the instant of mmWave beam
training relative to low-frequency CSI estimation. Meanwhile, long-short term
memory networks based dedicated models are designed to implement the
prediction. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme can achieve higher
beamforming gain than the conventional methods while requiring little overhead
of mmWave beam training.

the engineered control of electromagnetic waves. As such, they are envisioned
to enable a variety of exciting applications, among others in the domains of
smart textiles, high-resolution structural monitoring, and sensing in
challenging environments. Many of the applications envisage deformations of the
SDM structures, such as their bending, stretching or rolling, which implies
that the locations of metamaterial elements will be changing relative to one
another. In this paper, we argue that if the metamaterial elements would be
accurately localizable, this location information could potentially be utilized
for enabling novel SDM applications, as well as for optimizing the control of
the elements themselves. To enable their localization, we assume that these
elements are controlled wirelessly through a Terahertz (THz)-operating
nanonetwork. We consider the elements to be power-constrained, with their sole
powering option being to harvest energy from different environmental sources.
By means of simulation, we demonstrate sub-millimeter accuracy of the two-way
Time of Flight (ToF)-based localization, as well as high availability of the
service (i.e., consistently more than 80% of the time), which is a result of
the low energy consumed in the localization process. Finally, we qualitatively
characterize the latency of the proposed localization service, as well as
outline several challenges and future research directions.

with a power-law tail, these results are not conclusive, and other
distributions, not fat-tailed, could explain the data equally well. As an
example, simulation of a log-normally distributed random variable provides
synthetic data whose statistics are undistinguishable from the statistics of

  COVID-19",,,,,"stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Demand for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) such as surgical masks,
gloves, and gowns has increased significantly since the onset of the COVID-19
pandemic. In hospital settings, both medical staff and patients are required to
wear PPE. As these facilities resume regular operations, staff will be required
to wear PPE at all times while additional PPE will be mandated during medical
procedures. This will put increased pressure on hospitals which have had
problems predicting PPE usage and sourcing its supply. To meet this challenge,
we propose an approach to predict demand for PPE. Specifically, we model the
admission of patients to a medical department using multiple independent
queues. Each queue represents a class of patients with similar treatment plans
and hospital length-of-stay. By estimating the total workload of each class, we
derive closed-form estimates for the expected amount of PPE required over a
specified time horizon using current PPE guidelines. We apply our approach to a
data set of 22,039 patients admitted to the general internal medicine
department at St. Michael's hospital in Toronto, Canada from April 2010 to
November 2019. We find that gloves and surgical masks represent approximately
90% of predicted PPE usage. We also find that while demand for gloves is driven
entirely by patient-practitioner interactions, 86% of the predicted demand for
surgical masks can be attributed to the requirement that medical practitioners
will need to wear them when not interacting with patients.

oxidized silicon (Si) wafers. Combining precise wet etching processes with dry
etching processes, these Pt nanowires have been successfully released
free-standing between two silicon dioxide (SiO2) beams supported on Si

allowed to release the device gently without damaging the Pt nanowires. The
total fabrication time was minimized by restricting the use of e-beam
lithography to the patterning of the Pt nanowires while standard
photolithography was employed for other parts of the devices. We demonstrate
that the fabricated sensors are suitable for turbulence measurements when
operated in a constant-current mode. A robust calibration between output

  Adversarial Attacks on Image Classification",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep neural networks are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. White-box
adversarial attacks can fool neural networks with small adversarial
perturbations, especially for large size images. However, keeping successful
adversarial perturbations imperceptible is especially challenging for
transfer-based black-box adversarial attacks. Often such adversarial examples
can be easily spotted due to their unpleasantly poor visual qualities, which
compromises the threat of adversarial attacks in practice. In this study, to
improve the image quality of black-box adversarial examples perceptually, we
propose structure-aware adversarial attacks by generating adversarial images
based on psychological perceptual models. Specifically, we allow higher
perturbations on perceptually insignificant regions, while assigning lower or
no perturbation on visually sensitive regions. In addition to the proposed
spatial-constrained adversarial perturbations, we also propose a novel
structure-aware frequency adversarial attack method in the discrete cosine
transform (DCT) domain. Since the proposed attacks are independent of the
gradient estimation, they can be directly incorporated with existing
gradient-based attacks. Experimental results show that, with the comparable
attack success rate (ASR), the proposed methods can produce adversarial
examples with considerably improved visual quality for free. With the
comparable perceptual quality, the proposed approaches achieve higher attack
success rates: particularly for the frequency structure-aware attacks, the
average ASR improves more than 10% over the baseline attacks.

negligible value with respect to the far field confining stress. A novel
algorithm is here presented, which is capable of tracking the evolution of both

grounded on a recent viscous regularization of the quasi-static crack
propagation problem as a standard dissipative system. It allows a simple and
effective approximation of the fracture front velocity by imposing Griffith's
criterion at every propagation step. Furthermore, for each new fracture

crack opening and the fluid pressure, together with the non linear lubrication
equation governing the flow of the fluid inside the fracture.
