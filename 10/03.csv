  Challenge)",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This work aims at designing a lightweight convolutional neural network for
image super resolution (SR). With simplicity bare in mind, we construct a
pretty concise and effective network with a newly proposed pixel attention
scheme. Pixel attention (PA) is similar as channel attention and spatial
attention in formulation. The difference is that PA produces 3D attention maps
instead of a 1D attention vector or a 2D map. This attention scheme introduces
fewer additional parameters but generates better SR results. On the basis of
PA, we propose two building blocks for the main branch and the reconstruction
branch, respectively. The first one - SC-PA block has the same structure as the
Self-Calibrated convolution but with our PA layer. This block is much more
efficient than conventional residual/dense blocks, for its twobranch
architecture and attention scheme. While the second one - UPA block combines
the nearest-neighbor upsampling, convolution and PA layers. It improves the
final reconstruction quality with little parameter cost. Our final model- PAN
could achieve similar performance as the lightweight networks - SRResNet and
CARN, but with only 272K parameters (17.92% of SRResNet and 17.09% of CARN).
The effectiveness of each proposed component is also validated by ablation
study. The code is available at https://github.com/zhaohengyuan1/PAN.

Space Telescope over four years. We add to these ground-based, HST and K2
transit time measurements, and revisit an N-body dynamical analysis of the
seven-planet system using our complete set of times from which we refine the
mass ratios of the planets to the star. We next carry out a photodynamical
analysis of the Spitzer light curves to derive the density of the host star and
the planet densities. We find that all seven planets' densities may be
described with a single rocky mass-radius relation which is depleted in iron
relative to Earth, with Fe 21 wt% versus 32 wt% for Earth, and otherwise
Earth-like in composition. Alternatively, the planets may have an Earth-like
composition, but enhanced in light elements, such as a surface water layer or a
core-free structure with oxidized iron in the mantle. We measure planet masses
to a precision of 3-5%, equivalent to a radial-velocity (RV) precision of 2.5
cm/sec, or two orders of magnitude more precise than current RV capabilities.
We find the eccentricities of the planets are very small; the orbits are
extremely coplanar; and the system is stable on 10 Myr timescales. We find
evidence of infrequent timing outliers which we cannot explain with an eighth
planet; we instead account for the outliers using a robust likelihood function.
We forecast JWST timing observations, and speculate on possible implications of
the planet densities for the formation, migration and evolution of the planet
system.

light. Ballistic photons with a scattering-free propagation are, however,
exponentially rare and no method so far can increase their proportion. To
address these limitations, we introduce and experimentally implement here a new
set of optical states that we term Scattering Invariant Modes (SIMs), whose
transmitted field pattern is the same, irrespective of whether they scatter
through a disordered sample or propagate ballistically through a homogeneous

media, and show in simulations that their correlations with the ballistic light

configuration interaction (ACI) wave function provides the external cluster
amplitudes, named ACI-CC, is presented. By exploiting the connection between
configuration interaction and coupled cluster through cluster analysis, the
higher-order T3 and T4 terms obtained from ACI are used to augment the T1 and
T2 amplitude equations from traditional coupled cluster. These higher-order
contributions are kept frozen during the coupled cluster iterations and do not
contribute to an increased cost with respect to CCSD. We have benchmarked this
method on three closed-shell systems: beryllium dimer, carbonyl oxide, and
cyclobutadiene, with good results compared to other corrected coupled cluster
methods. In all cases, the inclusion of these external corrections improved
upon the ""gold standard"" CCSD(T) results, indicating that ACI-CCSD(T) can be
used to assess strong correlation effects in a system and as an inexpensive
starting point for more complex external corrections.

architecture to all the input instances. However, a fixed architecture may not
be representative enough for data with high diversity. To promote the model
capacity, existing approaches usually employ larger convolutional kernels or
deeper network structure, which may increase the computational cost. In this
paper, we address this issue by raising the Dynamic Graph Network (DG-Net). The
network learns the instance-aware connectivity, which creates different forward
paths for different instances. Specifically, the network is initialized as a
complete directed acyclic graph, where the nodes represent convolutional blocks
and the edges represent the connection paths. We generate edge weights by a
learnable module \textit{router} and select the edges whose weights are larger
than a threshold, to adjust the connectivity of the neural network structure.
Instead of using the same path of the network, DG-Net aggregates features
dynamically in each node, which allows the network to have more representation
ability. To facilitate the training, we represent the network connectivity of
each sample in an adjacency matrix. The matrix is updated to aggregate features
in the forward pass, cached in the memory, and used for gradient computing in
the backward pass. We verify the effectiveness of our method with several
static architectures, including MobileNetV2, ResNet, ResNeXt, and RegNet.
Extensive experiments are performed on ImageNet classification and COCO object
detection, which shows the effectiveness and generalization ability of our
approach.

conservation and the consistency of mass and momentum transport are implemented
to address the issue of physically coupling the Phase-Field equation, which
locates different phases, to the hydrodynamics. These two consistency
conditions provide the ``optimal'' coupling because (i) the new momentum
equation resulting from them is Galilean invariant and implies the kinetic
energy conservation, regardless of the details of the Phase-Field equation, and
(ii) failures of satisfying the second law of thermodynamics or the consistency
of reduction of the multiphase flow model only result from the same failures of
the Phase-Field equation but are not due to the new momentum equation. Physical
interpretation of the consistency conditions and their formulations are first
provided, and general formulations that are obtained from the consistency
conditions and independent of the interpretation of the velocity are
summarized. Several novel techniques are developed to inherit the physical
properties of the multiphase flows after discretization, including the
gradient-based phase selection procedure, the momentum conservative method for
the surface force, and the general theorems to preserve the consistency
conditions on the discrete level. Equipped with those novel techniques, a
consistent and conservative scheme for the present multiphase flow model is
developed and analyzed. Numerical applications demonstrate that the present

on an arbitrary multigraph, for given integral weights of magnitude at most
$W$. For simple bipartite graphs the best-known time bound is $O(n^{2/3}\, m\,
\log nW)$ (\cite{GT89}; $n$ and $m$ are respectively the number of vertices and
edges). A recent algorithm of Duan and He et al. \cite{DHZ} for $f$-factors of
simple graphs comes within logarithmic factors of this bound, $\widetilde{O}
(n^{2/3}\, m\, \log W)$. The best-known bound for bipartite multigraphs is
$O(\sqrt {\Phi}\, m\, \log \Phi W)$ ($\Phi\le m$ is the size of the $f$-factor,
$\Phi=\sum_{v\in V}f(v)/2$). This bound is more general than the restriction to
simple graphs, and is even superior on ""small"" simple graphs, i.e.,
$\Phi=o(n^{4/3})$. We present an algorithm that comes within a $\sqrt {\log
\Phi}$ factor of this bound, i.e., $O(\sqrt {\Phi \log \Phi}\,m \,\log \Phi
W)$.
  The algorithm is a direct generalization of the algorithm of Gabow and Tarjan
\cite{GT} for the special case of ordinary matching ($f\equiv 1$). We present
our algorithm first for ordinary matching, as the analysis is a simplified
version of \cite{GT}. Furthermore the algorithm and analysis both get
incorporated without modification into the multigraph algorithm.
  To extend these ideas to $f$-factors, the first step is ""expanding"" edges
(i.e., replacing an edge by a length 3 alternating path). \cite{DHZ} uses a
one-time expansion of the entire graph. Our algorithm keeps the graph small by
only expanding selected edges, and ""compressing"" them back to their original
source when no longer needed. Several other ideas are needed, including a
relaxation of the notion of ""blossom"" to e-blossom (""expanded blossom"").

temporal evolution of note states by abstract connections between the

propose a unified neural network architecture where multiple note states are

architectural complexity. Using the MAESTRO dataset, we examine various

symplectic potential that sets the dual charges to zero. This observation
relies on the ambiguity of the covariant phase space methods. To shed more
light on the dual contributions, we use the Kosmann variation to compute
(quasi-local) Hamiltonian charges for arbitrary diffeomorphisms. We obtain a
formula that illustrates comprehensively why the dual contribution to the
Hamiltonian charges: (i) vanishes for exact isometries and asymptotic
symmetries at spatial infinity; (ii) persists for asymptotic symmetries at

which enables reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to quickly adapt to unseen
tasks without any interactions with the environments, making RL truly practical
in many real-world applications. This problem is still not fully understood,
for which two major challenges need to be addressed. First, offline RL usually
suffers from bootstrapping errors of out-of-distribution state-actions which
leads to divergence of value functions. Second, meta-RL requires efficient and
robust task inference learned jointly with control policy. In this work, we
enforce behavior regularization on learned policy as a general approach to
offline RL, combined with a deterministic context encoder for efficient task
inference. We propose a novel negative-power distance metric on bounded context
embedding space, whose gradients propagation is detached from the Bellman
backup. We provide analysis and insight showing that some simple design choices

physical layer of a Millimeter Wave (mmWave) network equipped with several
Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRSs). In this network, multiple IRSs help the
Base Station (BS) to reach the signal to the desired user and at the same time
maintain the security of the network i.e. securing the signal from receiving by
the unallowable eavesdropper. The target of the proposed scheme is to maximize
the secrecy rate by jointly optimizing the active beamforming at the BS and
passive beamforming at the IRSs. This leads to a non-convex optimization
problem which we solve by decomposing into two sub-problems. The sub-problems
alternatively solve the active and passive beamforming design problems using
the Semi-Definite Relaxation (SDR) technique. Finally, simulations are done to
assess the performance of the proposed algorithm. These results show the
superiority of using multiple IRSs in the enhancement of the secrecy rate in
the wireless networks that operate in the mmWave frequency bands.

followed by a (ii) routing module which estimates a set of plausible
trajectories that route towards the estimated goal. We leverage information
about the past trajectory and visual context of the scene to estimate a
multi-modal probability distribution over the possible goal positions, which is
used to sample a potential goal during the inference. The routing is governed
by a recurrent neural network that reacts to physical constraints in the nearby
surroundings and generates feasible paths that route towards the sampled goal.
Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that our method establishes a new
state-of-the-art on several benchmarks while being able to generate a realistic

chains with multispin interactions introduced recently in \cite{AP2020}. The
exact integrability follows from the algebraic properties of the energy density
operators defining the quantum chains. The Hamiltonians are characterized by a
parameter $p=1,2,\dots$ related to the number of interacting spins in the
multispin interaction. In the general case the quantum spins are of infinite
dimension. In special cases, characterized by the parameter $N=2,3,\ldots$, the
quantum chains describe the dynamics of $Z(N)$ quantum spin chains. The
simplest case $p=1$ corresponds to the free fermionic quantum Ising chain
($N=2$) or the $Z(N)$ free parafermionic quantum chain. The eigenenergies of
the quantum chains are given in terms of the roots of special polynomials, and
for general values of $p$ the quantum chains are characterized by a free
fermionic ($N=2$) or free parafermionic ($N>2$) eigenspectrum. The models have
a special critical point when all coupling constants are equal. At this point
the ground-state energy is exactly calculated in the bulk limit, and our
analytical and numerical analyses indicate that the models belong to
universality classes of critical behavior with dynamical critical exponent $z =
(p+1)/N$ and specific-heat exponent $\alpha = \max\{0,1-(p+1)/N\}$.

know the recession velocity free of the effects of peculiar velocities. In this
work, we study different models of peculiar velocity in the local Universe. In
particular, we compare models based on density reconstruction from galaxy
redshift surveys and kernel smoothing of peculiar velocity data. The velocity
field from the density reconstruction is obtained using the 2M++ galaxy
redshift compilation, which is compared to two adaptive kernel-smoothed
velocity fields: the first obtained from the 6dF Fundamental Plane sample and
the other using a Tully-Fisher catalogue obtained by combining SFI++ and 2MTF.
We highlight that smoothed velocity fields should be rescaled to obtain
unbiased velocity estimates. Comparing the predictions of these models to the
observations from a few test sets of peculiar velocity data, obtained from the
Second Amendment Supernovae catalogue and the Tully-Fisher catalogues, we find
that 2M++ reconstruction provides a better model of the peculiar velocity in
the local Universe than the kernel-smoothed peculiar velocity models. We study
the impact of peculiar velocities on the measurement of $H_0$ from
gravitational waves and megamasers. In doing so, we introduce a probabilistic
framework to marginalize over the peculiar velocity corrections along the
line-of-sight. For the megamasers, we find $H_0 = 69^{+2.9}_{-2.8}$ km s^{-1}
Mpc^{-1} using the 2M++ velocity field. We also study the peculiar velocity of
the the galaxy NGC1052-DF2, concluding that a short $\sim$ 13 Mpc distance is
not a likely explanation of the anomalously low dark matter fraction of that

reabsorption processes taken into consideration, we find that the stellar
luminosity limits exclude a broad range of parameter space in the $S$

ranging from $7.0\times10^{-18}$ to $3.4\times10^{-3}$. We also apply the

relate the mixing angle to the parameters in the scalar potential. In both the
generic scalar case and the real-singlet extension, we show that the stellar

efficiency, and the multiplicity and spectrum of pairs accelerated by the

have based their measurements on single-dish detected sources, finding evidence
for strong clustering. However, ALMA has revealed that, due to the coarse
angular resolution of these instruments, single-dish sources can be comprised
of multiple sources. This implies that the clustering inferred from single-dish
surveys may be overestimated. Here, we measure the clustering of SMGs based on
the ALESS survey, an ALMA follow-up of sources previously identified in the
LABOCA ECDFS Submillimeter Survey (LESS). We present a method to measure the
clustering of ALMA sources that have been previously identified using
single-dish telescopes, based on forward modeling both the single-dish and the
ALMA observations. We constrain upper limits for the median mass of halos
hosting SMGs at $1<z<3$, finding
$M_{\rm{halo}}\leq2.4\times10^{12}\,\rm\,M_{\odot}$ for SMGs with flux
densities $S_{870}\geq4.0\,$mJy, which is at least $3.8^{+3.8}_{-2.6}$ times
lower than the mass inferred based on the clustering of the LESS sources alone.
This suggests that the strength of SMG clustering based on single-dish
observations was overestimated and therefore SMGs might be hosted by dark
matter halos less massive than has previously been estimated. By extrapolating
our models down to flux densities of $S_{870}\geq1.2\,\rm\,$mJy, we find that
such SMGs inhabit halos with median mass
$M_{\rm{halo}}\leq3.2\times10^{11}\,\rm\,M_{\odot}$. We conclude that only the
brightest ($S_{870}\gtrsim5-6\,\rm\,$mJy) SMGs would trace massive structures
at $z\sim2$ and only SMGs with $S_{870}\gtrsim6\,\rm\,$mJy may be connected to
massive local elliptical galaxies, quasars at intermediate redshifts and
high-redshift star-forming galaxies, whereas fainter SMGs are unlikely linked
to these populations.

asymmetry of the universe is generated through the CP and baryon number
violating, out-of-equilibrium decays of very massive gauge or Higgs bosons in
the very early universe. Recent constraints on the scale of inflation and the
subsequent temperature of reheating, however, have put pressure on many such
models. In this paper, we consider the role that primordial black holes may
have played in the process of GUT baryogenesis. Through Hawking evaporation,
black holes can efficiently generate GUT Higgs or gauge bosons, regardless of
the masses of these particles or the temperature of the early universe.
Furthermore, in significant regions of parameter space, the black holes
evaporate after the electroweak phase transition, naturally evading the problem
of sphaleron washout that is normally encountered in GUT models based on
$SU(5)$. We identify a wide range of scenarios in which black holes could
facilitate the generation of the baryon asymmetry through the production and
decays of GUT bosons.

dark matter (CDM) between big bang nucleosynthesis and matter-radiation
equality can account for the entire dark matter relic density. Because of its
transition from dark radiation, ""late-forming dark matter"" (LFDM) suppresses
the growth of linear matter perturbations and imprints the oscillatory
signatures of dark radiation perturbations on small scales. The cutoff scale in
the linear matter power spectrum is set by the redshift $z_T$ of the phase
transition; tracers of small-scale structure can therefore be used to infer the
LFDM formation epoch. Here, we use a forward model of the Milky Way (MW)
satellite galaxy population to address the question: How late can dark matter
form? For dark radiation with strong self-interactions, which arises in
theories of neutrinolike LFDM, we report $z_{T}>5.5\times 10^6$ at $95\%$
confidence based on the abundance of known MW satellite galaxies. This limit
rigorously accounts for observational incompleteness corrections, marginalizes
over uncertainties in the connection between dwarf galaxies and dark matter
halos, and improves upon galaxy clustering and Lyman-$\alpha$ forest
constraints by nearly an order of magnitude. We show that this limit can also
be interpreted as a lower bound on $z_T$ for LFDM that free-streams prior to
its phase transition, although dedicated simulations will be needed to analyze
this case in detail. Thus, dark matter created by a transition from dark
radiation must form no later than one week after the big bang.

$\sigma_8=0.783^{+0.064}_{-0.054}$. This result is consistent with constraints
from the DES-Y1 galaxy clustering and weak lensing two-point correlation

spectrum gives constraints on r that are cosmic-variance limited (with
$\sigma$(r)=0.093), but we show that the marginalized posterior peaks towards
negative values of r at about the 1.2$\sigma$ level. We derived Planck
constraints using the BB power spectrum at both large angular scales (the
'reionization bump') and intermediate angular scales (the 'recombination bump')
from $\ell$=2 to 150, and find a stronger constraint than that from TT, with
$\sigma$(r)=0.069. The Planck BB spectrum shows no systematic bias, and is
compatible with zero, given both the statistical noise and the systematic
uncertainties. The likelihood analysis using B modes yields the constraint
r<0.158 at 95% confidence using more than 50% of the sky. This upper limit
tightens to r<0.069 when Planck EE, BB, and EB power spectra are combined
consistently, and it tightens further to r<0.056 when the Planck TT power
spectrum is included in the combination. Finally, combining Planck with

originating from the wake that a jet produced in a heavy ion collision leaves
in the droplet of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) through which it propagates, using
linearized hydrodynamics on a background Bjorken flow. Jet energy and momentum
loss described by the hybrid model become currents sourcing linearized
hydrodynamics. By solving the linearized hydrodynamic equations numerically, we
investigate the development of the wake in the dynamically evolving droplet of
QGP, study the effect of viscosity, scrutinize energy-momentum conservation,
and check the validity of the linear approximation. We find that linearized
hydrodynamics works better in the viscous case because diffusive modes damp the
energy-momentum perturbation produced by the jet. We calculate the distribution
of particles produced from the jet wake by using the Cooper-Frye prescription
and find that both the transverse momentum spectrum and the distribution of
particles in azimuthal angle are similar in shape in linearized hydrodynamics
and in the hybrid model. Their normalizations are different because the
momentum-rapidity distribution in the linearized hydrodynamics analysis is more
spread out, due to sound modes. Since the Bjorken flow has no transverse
expansion, we explore the effect of transverse flow by using local boosts to
add it into the Cooper-Frye formula. After including the effects of transverse
flow in this way, the transverse momentum spectrum becomes harder: more
particles with transverse momenta bigger than $2$ GeV are produced than in the
hybrid model. Although we defer implementing this analysis in a jet Monte
Carlo, as would be needed to make quantitative comparisons to data, we gain a
qualitative sense of how the jet wake may modify jet observables by computing
proxies for two example observables: the lost energy recovered in a cone of
varying open angle, and the fragmentation function. We find that linearized
hydrodynamics with transverse flow effects added improves the description of
the jet wake in the hybrid model in just the way that comparison to data
indicates is needed. Our study illuminates a path to improving the description
of the wake in the hybrid model, highlighting the need to take into account the
effects of both transverse flow and the broadening of the energy-momentum
perturbation in spacetime rapidity on particle production.

Distribution (HOD) modelling of the SMF, clustering, and lensing of BOSS LOWZ
and CMASS samples at Planck cosmology. We allow the selection function of
satellite galaxies to vary as a function of stellar mass as well as halo mass.
For centrals we assume their selection to depend only on stellar mass, as
informed by the directly measured detection fraction of the redMaPPer central
galaxies. The best-fitting HOD successfully describes all three observables
without over-predicting the small-scale lensing signal. This indicates that the
model places BOSS galaxies into dark matter halos of the correct halo masses,
thereby eliminating the discrepancy in the one-halo regime where the
signal-to-noise of lensing is the highest. Despite the large uncertainties, the
observed lensing amplitude above 1 Mpc/h remains inconsistent with the
prediction, which is however firmly anchored by the large-scale galaxy bias
measured by clustering at Planck cosmology. Therefore, we demonstrate that the
""lensing is low"" discrepancy on scales below 1 Mpc/h can be fully resolved by
accounting for the halo mass dependence of the selection function. Lensing
measurements with improved accuracy is required on large scales to distinguish

inclination: face-on galaxies show less attenuation and steeper curves compared
to edge-on galaxies, suggesting that geometric effects dominate observed
variations in attenuation. Our new method produces $2175$A UV bump detections
for 260 individual galaxies. Even though obvious correlations between UV bump
strength and global galaxy properties are absent, strong UV bumps are most
often seen in face-on, lower-mass galaxies (10 $<$
log$_{10}$(M$_*$/M$_{\odot}$) $<$ 10.5) with low overall attenuation. Finally,
we produce a typical attenuation curve for star-forming galaxies at $z\sim0.8$;
this prescription represents the effect of dust on the integrated spectral
energy distributions of high-redshift galaxies more accurately than commonly
used attenuation laws.

Semantics-Guided Affinity Propagation (SG-AP), we are able to assign
pseudo-labels to selected unlabeled data in a progressive fashion, under the

augment the labeled training data in the semi-supervised setting. Our

superiority of our SGC-DPL over state-of-the-art methods across different

describes the local (~4000 AU) outflow activity associated with Chamaeleon-MMS1

evolutionary state of this young low-mass source. We used the Atacama Large
Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) to observe Chamaeleon MMS1 at 220 GHz at
high spatial (~75 AU) and spectral resolutions (0.1-0.3 km/s). A low energy
outflow is detected through its interaction with the surrounding cloud. The
outflow consists of two components, a broad spectral feature to the northeast
and narrow features to both the northeast and southwest. The rotational
temperature of formaldehyde (H2CO) is calculated to be 50 (+/-30) K toward the
continuum source with similarly low temperatures (25-45 K) toward clumps
affected by the outflow. Methanol (CH3OH) is only detected toward gas clumps
located away from the continuum source, where the methanol is expected to have
been released by the energy of the outflow through ice sputtering in shock
waves. Chamaeleon-MMS1 shows outflow activity with the power source being
either a single precessing outflow or two outflows from a binary system. While
molecular emission and high outflow speeds rule it out as a FHSC, the outflow
is less energetic than outflows detected from other Class 0 objects and the
inferred gas temperatures toward the continuum source are relatively low, which
indicates that Cha-MMS1 is one of the youngest known sources.

spreading dynamics of a liquid droplet, generated by a needle free deposition
system called the liquid needle droplet deposition technique. This technique
utilizes a continuous liquid jet generated from a pressurized dosing system
which generates a liquid drop on a substrate to be characterized by optical
contact angle measurements. Although many studies have explored the theoretical
modelling of the droplet spreading scenario, a theoretical model representing
the spreading dynamics of a droplet, generated by the jet impact and continuous
addition of liquid mass, is yet to be addressed. In this study, we developed a
theoretical model based on the overall energy balance approach which enables us
to study on the physics of variation of droplet spreading under surrounding
medium of various viscosities. The numerical solution of the non-linear
ordinary differential equation has provided us the opportunity to comment on
the variation of droplet spreading, as a function of Weber number ($We$),
Reynolds number ($Re$) and Bond number ($Bo$) ranging from 0.5-3, 75-150, and
0.001-0.3, respectively. We have also presented a liquid jet impact model in
order to predict the initial droplet diameter as an initial condition for the
proposed governing equation. The model has been verified further with the
experimental measurements and reasonable agreement has been observed.
Experimental observations and theoretical investigations also highlight the
precision, repeatability and wide range of the applicability of liquid needle

modeling, especially for images, primarily because we can efficiently evaluate
the likelihood of a data point. This is desirable both for evaluating the fit
of a model, and for ease of training, as maximizing the likelihood can be done
by gradient descent. However, training normalizing flows comes with
difficulties as well: models which produce good samples typically need to be
extremely deep -- which comes with accompanying vanishing/exploding gradient
problems. A very related problem is that they are often poorly conditioned:
since they are parametrized as invertible maps from $\mathbb{R}^d \to
\mathbb{R}^d$, and typical training data like images intuitively is
lower-dimensional, the learned maps often have Jacobians that are close to
being singular.
  In our paper, we tackle representational aspects around depth and
conditioning of normalizing flows: both for general invertible architectures,
and for a particular common architecture, affine couplings. We prove that
$\Theta(1)$ affine coupling layers suffice to exactly represent a permutation
or $1 \times 1$ convolution, as used in GLOW, showing that representationally
the choice of partition is not a bottleneck for depth. We also show that
shallow affine coupling networks are universal approximators in Wasserstein
distance if ill-conditioning is allowed, and experimentally investigate related
phenomena involving padding. Finally, we show a depth lower bound for general
flow architectures with few neurons per layer and bounded Lipschitz constant.

The frequencies, lifetimes, and eigenfunctions of solar acoustic
waves are affected by turbulent convection, which is random in space and in
time. Since the correlation time of solar granulation and the periods of
acoustic waves ($\sim$5 min) are similar, the medium in which the waves
propagate cannot a priori be assumed to be time independent. Aims. We compare
various effective-medium solutions with numerical solutions in order to
identify the approximations that can be used in helioseismology. For the sake
of simplicity, the medium is one dimensional. Methods. We consider the Keller
approximation, the second-order Born approximation, and spatial homogenization
to obtain theoretical values for the effective wave speed and attenuation
(averaged over the realizations of the medium). Numerically, we computed the
first and second statistical moments of the wave field over many thousands of
realizations of the medium (finite-amplitude sound-speed perturbations are
limited to a 30 Mm band and have a zero mean). Results. The effective wave
speed is reduced for both the theories and the simulations. The attenuation of
the coherent wave field and the wave speed are best described by the Keller
theory. The numerical simulations reveal the presence of coda waves, trailing
the coherent wave packet. These late arrival waves are due to multiple
scattering and are easily seen in the second moment of the wave field.
Conclusions. We find that the effective wave speed can be calculated,
numerically and theoretically, using a single snapshot of the random medium
(frozen medium); however, the attenuation is underestimated in the frozen
medium compared to the time-dependent medium. Multiple scattering cannot be
ignored when modeling acoustic wave propagation through solar granulation.

solenoidally or compressively. We find that only simulations with an initially
strong magnetic field (plasma-$\beta<1$) show a change in the preferential
orientation between the magnetic field and isodensity contours, from mostly
parallel at low densities to mostly perpendicular at higher densities. Hence,
compressive turbulence alone is not capable of inducing the transition observed
towards nearby molecular clouds. At the same high initial magnetisation, we
find that solenoidal modes produce a sharper transition in the relative
orientation with increasing density than compressive modes. We further study
the time evolution of the relative orientation and find that it remains
unchanged by the turbulent forcing after one dynamical timescale.

optimization problem is posed for learning the weights of the neural network. A

Covariate shift adaptation yields good generalization performance when domains
differ only by the marginal distribution of features. Covariate shift
adaptation is usually implemented using importance weighting, which may fail,
according to common wisdom, due to small effective sample sizes (ESS). Previous
research argues this scenario is more common in high-dimensional settings.
However, how effective sample size, dimensionality, and model
performance/generalization are formally related in supervised learning,
considering the context of covariate shift adaptation, is still somewhat
obscure in the literature. Thus, a main challenge is presenting a unified
theory connecting those points. Hence, in this paper, we focus on building a
unified view connecting the ESS, data dimensionality, and generalization in the

dimensionality reduction or feature selection can increase the ESS, and argue
that our results support dimensionality reduction before covariate shift

Survey DR7 with morphological classifications from Galaxy Zoo, and compare with
the EAGLE cosmological simulation. At fixed halo mass in the mass range
$10^{11.7}-10^{12.9}M_{\odot}$, the median stellar masses of SDSS disc galaxies
are up to a factor of 1.4 higher than the median masses of their elliptical
counterparts. However, when we switch from the stellar masses from Kauffmann et
al. to those calculated by Chang et al. or Brinchmann et al., the median SHMR
from discs and ellipticals coincide in this mass range. For halo masses larger
than $10^{13}M_{\odot}$, discs are less massive than ellipticals in same-mass
haloes, regardless of whose stellar mass estimates we use. However, we find
that for these high halo masses the results for discs may be affected by
central/satellite misclassifications. The EAGLE simulation predicts that discs
are up to a factor of 1.5 more massive than elliptical galaxies residing in
same-mass haloes less massive than $10^{13}M_{\odot}$, in agreement with the
Kauffmann et al. data. Haloes with masses between $10^{11.5}$ and
$10^{12}M_{\odot}$, that host disc galaxies, were assembled earlier than those
hosting ellipticals. This suggests that the discs are more massive because they
had more time for gas accretion and star formation. In
$10^{12}-10^{12.5}M_{\odot}$ haloes, the central black holes in elliptical
galaxies grew faster and became more massive than their counterparts in disc
galaxies. This suggests that in this halo mass range the ellipticals are less
massive because AGN feedback ejected more of the halo's gas reservoir, reducing
star formation, and suppressing the (re)growth of stellar discs.

not accurately reflect the current communication policy of each agent, and this
complicates learning. We therefore introduce a 'communication correction' which

likely under the communicator's current policy, and thus be a better reflection
of the receiver's current environment. To account for cases in which agents are
both senders and receivers, we introduce an ordered relabelling scheme. Our
correction is computationally efficient and can be integrated with a range of
off-policy algorithms. We find in our experiments that it substantially
improves the ability of communicating MARL systems to learn across a variety of

Traditionally, MM potentials have relied on human-curated, inflexible, and
poorly extensible discrete chemical perception rules or applying parameters to
small molecules or biopolymers, making it difficult to optimize both types and
parameters to fit quantum chemical or physical property data. Here, we propose
an alternative approach that uses graph neural networks to perceive chemical
environments, producing continuous atom embeddings from which valence and
nonbonded parameters can be predicted using invariance-preserving layers. Since
all stages are built from smooth neural functions, the entire process is
modular and end-to-end differentiable with respect to model parameters,
allowing new force fields to be easily constructed, extended, and applied to
arbitrary molecules. We show that this approach is not only sufficiently
expressive to reproduce legacy atom types, but that it can learn to accurately
reproduce and extend existing molecular mechanics force fields. Trained with
arbitrary loss functions, it can construct entirely new force fields
self-consistently applicable to both biopolymers and small molecules directly
from quantum chemical calculations, with superior fidelity than traditional
atom or parameter typing schemes. When trained on the same quantum chemical
small molecule dataset used to parameterize the openff-1.2.0 small molecule

collapsing solution at $a=1/2$ as well as prove the existence of a leading
order complex singularity for general values of $a$ in the analytical
continuation of the solution from the real spatial coordinate into the complex

extent of the blow-up region expands infinitely fast at the singularity time.
For $a \gtrsim 1.3$, we find that the solution exists globally with

In this paper, we present a semi-supervised approach for threat recognition
which we call Background Adaptive Faster R-CNN. This approach is a training
method for two-stage object detectors which uses Domain Adaptation methods from
the field of deep learning. The data sources described earlier make two
""domains"": a hand-collected data domain of images with threats, and a
real-world domain of images assumed without threats. Two domain discriminators,
one for discriminating object proposals and one for image features, are
adversarially trained to prevent encoding domain-specific information. Without
this penalty a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can learn to identify domains
based on superficial characteristics, and minimize a supervised loss function
without improving its ability to recognize objects. For the hand-collected
data, only object proposals and image features from backgrounds are used. The
losses for these domain-adaptive discriminators are added to the Faster R-CNN
losses of images from both domains. This can reduce threat detection false
alarm rates by matching the statistics of extracted features from
hand-collected backgrounds to real world data. Performance improvements are
demonstrated on two independently-collected datasets of labeled threats.

very-forward angles including $0^\circ$ has been established as a tool to study
electric-dipole strength distributions in nuclei. The present work reports a
systematic investigation of the chain of stable even-mass Nd isotopes
representing a transition from spherical to quadrupole-deformed nuclei.
  Purpose: Extraction of the equivalent photo-absorption cross sections and
analysis of their fine structure in the energy region of the IsoVector Giant
Dipole Resonance (IVGDR).
  Method: Proton inelastic scattering reactions of 200 MeV protons were
measured at iThemba LABS in Cape Town, South Africa. The scattering products
were momentum-analysed by the K600 magnetic spectrometer positioned at
$\theta_{\mathrm{Lab}}=0^\circ$. Using dispersion-matching techniques, energy
resolutions of $\Delta E \approx 40 - 50$ keV were obtained. After subtraction
of background and contributions from other multipoles, the spectra were
converted to photo-absorption cross sections using the equivalent
virtual-photon method.
  Results: Wavelet-analysis techniques are used to extract characteristic
energy scales of the fine structure of the IVGDR from the experimental data.
Comparisons with the Quasiparticle-Phonon Model (QPM) and Skyrme Separable
Random Phase Approximation (SSRPA) predictions provide insight into the role of
different giant resonance damping mechanisms.
  Conclusions: Fine structure is observed even for the most deformed nuclei
studied. Fragmentation of the one particle-one hole ($1p1h$) strength seems to
be the main source of fine structure in both spherical and deformed nuclei.
Some impact of the spreading due to coupling of the two particle-two hole
($2p2h$) states to the $1p1h$ doorway states is seen in the
spherical/transitional nuclei, where calculations beyond the $1p1h$ level are
available.

in very short time (matter of seconds on an ordinary laptop), a Bayesian
classifier can distinguish between Sato-Tate groups given a small number of
Euler factors for the L-function. Our observations are in keeping with the
Sato-Tate conjecture for curves of low genus. For elliptic curves, this amounts
to distinguishing generic curves (with Sato-Tate group SU(2)) from those with
complex multiplication. In genus 2, a principal component analysis is observed
to separate the generic Sato-Tate group USp(4) from the non-generic groups.
Furthermore in this case, for which there are many more non-generic
possibilities than in the case of elliptic curves, we demonstrate an accurate
characterisation of several Sato-Tate groups with the same identity component.
Throughout, our observations are verified using known results from the
literature and the data available in the LMFDB. The results in this paper

Centers operate a myriad of cameras installed over a network. Injecting some

article presents a novel approach to automatically monitor real time traffic
footage using deep convolutional neural networks and a stand-alone graphical

process of developing models that serve as an integrated framework for an
artificial intelligence enabled traffic monitoring system. The proposed system
deploys several state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to automate different
traffic monitoring needs. Taking advantage of a large database of annotated
video surveillance data, deep learning-based models are trained to detect
queues, track stationary vehicles, and tabulate vehicle counts. A pixel-level
segmentation approach is applied to detect traffic queues and predict severity.
Real-time object detection algorithms coupled with different tracking systems
are deployed to automatically detect stranded vehicles as well as perform
vehicular counts. At each stages of development, interesting experimental
results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system.
Overall, the results demonstrate that the proposed framework performs
satisfactorily under varied conditions without being immensely impacted by

by specializing the learned features on individual datasets in order to
maximize performance. The results of our experiments show that the proposed

preambles. To support different priorities due to various quality-of-service
(QoS) requirements, random access can be generalized with multiple pools, which
may result in low spectral efficiency. In this paper, for high spectral
efficiency, random access with layered preambles (RALP) is proposed to support
devices with two different priorities based on the notion of power-domain
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In RALP, two groups of devices, namely
type-1 and type-2 devices, are supported with different priorities, where
type-1 devices have higher priority than type-2 devices. Closed-form
expressions are derived for the detection performance of preambles transmitted
by type-1 devices, which can be used for a certain performance guarantee of
type-1 devices of high priority. Low-complexity preamble detection methods are
also discussed.

  Vectors of Facial Muscle Movements","Submitting to IEEE Trans. 10 pages, 7 figures. Final Manuscript",,,,"cs.CV q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Speech disorders such as stuttering disrupt the normal fluency of speech by
involuntary repetitions, prolongations and blocking of sounds and syllables. In
addition to these disruptions to speech fluency, most adults who stutter (AWS)
also experience numerous observable secondary behaviors before, during, and
after a stuttering moment, often involving the facial muscles. Recent studies
have explored automatic detection of stuttering using Artificial Intelligence
(AI) based algorithm from respiratory rate, audio, etc. during speech
utterance. However, most methods require controlled environments and/or
invasive wearable sensors, and are unable explain why a decision (fluent vs
stuttered) was made. We hypothesize that pre-speech facial activity in AWS,
which can be captured non-invasively, contains enough information to accurately
classify the upcoming utterance as either fluent or stuttered. Towards this
end, this paper proposes a novel explainable AI (XAI) assisted convolutional
neural network (CNN) classifier to predict near future stuttering by learning
temporal facial muscle movement patterns of AWS and explains the important
facial muscles and actions involved. Statistical analyses reveal significantly
high prevalence of cheek muscles (p<0.005) and lip muscles (p<0.005) to predict
stuttering and shows a behavior conducive of arousal and anticipation to speak.
The temporal study of these upper and lower facial muscles may facilitate early
detection of stuttering, promote automated assessment of stuttering and have
application in behavioral therapies by providing automatic non-invasive
feedback in realtime.

power factor has mostly escaped attention. While initial reports did not find
any significant changes to the power factor compared to the bulk, subsequent
detailed measurements on p-type silicon nanowires showed a stark reduction in
the Seebeck coefficient when compared to similarly doped bulk. The reduction is
consistent with the disappearance of the phonon drag contribution, due to
phonon boundary scattering. Here, we report measurements on a different
nanostructure, holey silicon films, to test if similar loss of phonon drag can
be observed. By devising experiments where all properties are measured on the
same sample, we show that though these films possess electrical conductivity
close to that in the bulk at comparable doping, they exhibit considerably
smaller thermopower. The data are consistent with loss of phonon drag. At neck
distances between 120 - 230 nm, the power factor at optimal doping is $\sim$ 50

$\sigma_z$-coupling, offering gate times of 10s of ns even when the qubits and
the cavity are far detuned. No dipole moment is necessary: the qubit transverse
$\sigma_x$-coupling to the resonator is zero at the full sweet spot of the
encoded spin qubit of interest (a triple quantum dot three-electron
exchange-only qubit or a double quantum dot singlet-triplet qubit). This
approach allows always-on, exchange-only qubits, for example, to stay on their
""sweet spots"" during gate operations, minimizing the charge noise and
eliminating an always-on static longitudinal qubit-qubit coupling. We calculate
the main gate errors due to the (1) diffusion (Johnson) noise and (2) damping

$1/f$-noise on the longitudinal coupling, (4) qubit dephasing and ac-Stark

related to its reliability has brought attention because, with small
perturbations made intentionally in the input image (adversarial attack), its

preserves model accuracy against channel pruning, $\ell_{1/2, 3/4}$ yield
better compressed models with similar accuracies after retraining as $\ell_1$,

monostable in nature, resembling the well known Fisher-KPP equation. Such a
system covers various models arising from mathematical biology, with the
Fisher-KPP equation as the simplest special case, where a ""spreading-vanishing""
dichotomy is known to govern the long time dynamical behaviour. The question of
spreading speed is widely open for such systems except for the scalar case. In
this paper, we develop a systematic approach to determine the spreading profile

decide exactly when the spreading has finite speed, or infinite speed
(accelerated spreading). This relies on a rather complete understanding of both

obtain sharp estimates of the semi-wave profile and the spreading speed. For
kernel functions that behave like $|x|^{-\gamma}$ near infinity, we are able to
obtain better estimates of the spreading speed for both the finite speed case,

to the views of others. A Bayesian decision maker learns about the world by
first selecting a set of information sources and then observing a signal from
one of them. If some sources are more accurate than others but it's not clear
which, sampling the signals close to one's prior expectation is more
informative, as they are more likely high quality. The optimal echo chamber
balances the credibility of views similar to one's own against the usefulness
of those further away.

have recently worked on the compressing and accelerating deep convolutional
neural networks. Based on this, we propose a novel uniform channel pruning
(UCP) method to prune deep CNN, and the modified squeeze-and-excitation blocks
(MSEB) is used to measure the importance of the channels in the convolutional
layers. The unimportant channels, including convolutional kernels related to
them, are pruned directly, which greatly reduces the storage cost and the
number of calculations. There are two types of residual blocks in ResNet. For
ResNet with bottlenecks, we use the pruning method with traditional CNN to trim
the 3x3 convolutional layer in the middle of the blocks. For ResNet with basic
residual blocks, we propose an approach to consistently prune all residual
blocks in the same stage to ensure that the compact network structure is
dimensionally correct. Considering that the network loses considerable
information after pruning and that the larger the pruning amplitude is, the
more information that will be lost, we do not choose fine-tuning but retrain
from scratch to restore the accuracy of the network after pruning. Finally, we
verified our method on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ILSVRC-2012 for image
classification. The results indicate that the performance of the compact
network after retraining from scratch, when the pruning rate is small, is
better than the original network. Even when the pruning amplitude is large, the
accuracy can be maintained or decreased slightly. On the CIFAR-100, when
reducing the parameters and FLOPs up to 82% and 62% respectively, the accuracy
of VGG-19 even improved by 0.54% after retraining.

using lattice QCD and hadronic effective theory in a unitarized coupled-channel
framework. A direct comparison between the two approaches is possible by
considering the hadronic effective theory in a finite volume and with hadron
masses and mesonic decay constants that correspond to the situation studied on
the lattice. Comparing the energy level spectrum and $SU(3)$ flavor
decompositions of the individual states, it is found that the lowest two states
extracted from lattice QCD can be identified with one of the two
$\Lambda(1405)$-poles and the $\Lambda(1670)$ resonance. The quark mass
dependences of these two lattice QCD levels are in good agreement with their
effective theory counterparts. However, as current lattice QCD studies still
rely on three-quark operators to generate the physical states, clear signals
corresponding to the meson-baryon scattering states, that appear in the finite
volume effective theory calculation, are not yet seen.

Millimeter/submillimeter Array at an angular resolution of ~0.""1 (14 au). The
continuum emission of the binary component, Source A, reveals the substructure
consisting of 5 intensity peaks within 100 au from the protostar. The C17O
emission mainly traces the circummultiple structure on a 300 au scale centered
at the intensity centroid of the continuum, while it is very weak within the
radius of 50 au from the centroid. The H2CS emission, in contrast, traces the
rotating disk structure around one of the continuum peaks (A1). Thus, it seems
that the rotation centroid of the circummultiple structure is slightly
different from that of the disk around A1. We derive the rotation temperature
by using the multiple lines of H2CS. As approaching to the protostar A1, the
rotation temperature steeply rises up to 300 K or higher at the radius of 50 au
from the protostar. It is likely due to a local accretion shock and/or the
preferential protostellar heating of the transition zone from the
circummultiple structure to the disk around A1. This position corresponds to
the place where the organic molecular lines are reported to be enhanced. Since
the rise of the rotation temperature of H2CS most likely represents the rise of
the gas and dust temperatures, it would be related to the chemical
characteristics of this prototypical hot corino.

of GANs involve constraining or regularizing the discriminator. In this paper
we consider a largely overlooked regularization technique which we refer to as
the Adversary's Assistant (AdvAs). We motivate this using a different
perspective to that of prior work. Specifically, we consider a common mismatch
between theoretical analysis and practice: analysis often assumes that the
discriminator reaches its optimum on each iteration. In practice, this is
essentially never true, often leading to poor gradient estimates for the
generator. To address this, AdvAs is a theoretically motivated penalty imposed
on the generator based on the norm of the gradients used to train the
discriminator. This encourages the generator to move towards points where the
discriminator is optimal. We demonstrate the effect of applying AdvAs to
several GAN objectives, datasets and network architectures. The results
indicate a reduction in the mismatch between theory and practice and that AdvAs
can lead to improvement of GAN training, as measured by FID scores.

perform well when gradient measurements are corrupted by noise. We show that by
treating the secant condition with a penalty method approach motivated by
regularized least squares estimation, one can smoothly interpolate between
updating the inverse Hessian approximation with the original BFGS update
formula and not updating the inverse Hessian approximation. Furthermore, we
find the curvature condition is smoothly relaxed as the interpolation moves
towards not updating the inverse Hessian approximation, disappearing entirely
when the inverse Hessian approximation is not updated. These developments allow
us to develop a method we refer to as secant penalized BFGS (SP-BFGS) that
allows one to relax the secant condition based on the amount of noise in the
gradient measurements. SP-BFGS provides a means of incrementally updating the
new inverse Hessian approximation with a controlled amount of bias towards the
previous inverse Hessian approximation, which allows one to replace the
overwriting nature of the original BFGS update with an averaging nature that
resists the destructive effects of noise and can cope with negative curvature
measurements. We discuss the theoretical properties of SP-BFGS, including
convergence when minimizing strongly convex functions in the presence of
uniformly bounded noise. Finally, we present extensive numerical experiments
using over 30 problems from the CUTEst test problem set that demonstrate the
superior performance of SP-BFGS compared to BFGS in the presence of both noisy

wider networks for better performances. However, it remains elusive how neural
network width affects model robustness. In this paper, we carefully examine the
relationship between network width and model robustness. Specifically, we show
that the model robustness is closely related to the tradeoff between natural
accuracy and perturbation stability, which is controlled by the robust
regularization parameter $\lambda$. With the same $\lambda$, wider networks can
achieve better natural accuracy but worse perturbation stability, leading to a
potentially worse overall model robustness. To understand the origin of this
phenomenon, we further relate the perturbation stability with the network's
local Lipschitzness. By leveraging recent results on neural tangent kernels, we
theoretically show that wider networks tend to have worse perturbation
stability. Our analyses suggest that: 1) the common strategy of first
fine-tuning $\lambda$ on small networks and then directly use it for wide model
training could lead to deteriorated model robustness; 2) one needs to properly
enlarge $\lambda$ to unleash the robustness potential of wider models fully.
Finally, we propose a new Width Adjusted Regularization (WAR) method that
adaptively enlarges $\lambda$ on wide models and significantly saves the tuning

quaternions to the set of quaternions, which is a Euclidean space, such that
the set of unit quaternions is an invariant set of the extended dynamics. Such
a stable extension of the system dynamics to a Euclidean space allows us to
employ well studied Lyapunov techniques in Euclidean spaces such as
LaSalle-Yoshizawa's theorem. A robust tracking control law is proposed for the
attitude dynamics subject to unknown constant disturbance and the convergence
properties of the tracking control law is rigorously proven. It is demonstrated
with the help of numerical simulations that the proposed control law has a
remarkable performance even in some challenging situations.

MIP formulation. We show that using such extended formulation, valid
inequalities having similar structures to those in the standard one allow
achieving tighter linear relaxation bounds. Furthermore, we propose a
preprocessing approach to reduce the size of a multi-commodity MIP formulation

Computational experiments indicate that the use of the valid inequalities in a
branch-and-cut approach significantly increase the ability of a MIP solver to
solve instances to optimality. Additionally, the valid inequalities for the
extended formulation outperform those for the standard one in terms of number
of solved instances, running time and number of enumerated nodes. Moreover, the
proposed heuristic is able to generate solutions with considerably low
optimality gaps within very short computational times even for large instances.
Combining the preprocessing approach with the heuristic, one can achieve an
increase in the number of solutions solved to optimality within the time limit
together with significant reductions on the average times for solving them.

analysis we consider signal events for vector-boson fusion and VLL pair

charged leptons of different flavor and two sterile neutrinos that provide a
missing energy. We also consider the case of VLL single production where, in

obtained via an evolutive algorithm, whose objective is to maximise either the
accuracy metric or the Asimov significance for different masses of the VLL.
Taking into account the effect of the three analysed topologies, we have found
that the combined significance for the observation of new VLLs at the
high-luminosity LHC can range from $5.7\sigma$, for a mass of
$1.25~\mathrm{TeV}$, all the way up to $28\sigma$ if the VLL mass is
$200~\mathrm{GeV}$. We have also shown that by the end of the LHC Run-III a
$200~\mathrm{GeV}$ VLL can be excluded with a confidence of $8.8$ standard

the end of the LHC operations and, in particular, providing important
phenomenological information to constrain the energy scale at which new gauge
symmetries emergent from the considered Grand Unification picture can be

1.5um, which could well be explained by a mix of carbon bearing molecules. CO2,
when included is systematically detected. One of the main difficulties to
constrain the abundance of those molecules is their weak signatures across the
HST WFC3 wavelength coverage, particularly when compared to those of water.
Through a comprehensive retrieval analysis, we attempt to explain the main
degeneracies present in this dataset and explore some of the recurrent
challenges that are occurring in retrieval studies (e.g: the impact of model
selection, the use of free vs self-consistent chemistry and the combination of
instrument observations). Our results make this planet an exceptional example

  Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno Algorithm",,,,,"cs.LG math.OC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We consider the problem of how to learn a step-size policy for the
Limited-Memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm. This is a
limited computational memory quasi-Newton method widely used for deterministic
unconstrained optimization but currently avoided in large-scale problems for
requiring step sizes to be provided at each iteration. Existing methodologies
for the step size selection for L-BFGS use heuristic tuning of design
parameters and massive re-evaluations of the objective function and gradient to
find appropriate step-lengths. We propose a neural network architecture with
local information of the current iterate as the input. The step-length policy
is learned from data of similar optimization problems, avoids additional
evaluations of the objective function, and guarantees that the output step
remains inside a pre-defined interval. The corresponding training procedure is
formulated as a stochastic optimization problem using the backpropagation
through time algorithm. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on
the training of classifiers for the MNIST database for handwritten digits and
for CIFAR-10. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms
heuristically tuned optimizers such as ADAM, RMSprop, L-BFGS with a
backtracking line search, and L-BFGS with a constant step size. The numerical
results also show that a learned policy can be used as a warm-start to train
new policies for different problems after a few additional training steps,
highlighting its potential use in multiple large-scale optimization problems.

obtained through aerial photography of the scene (e.g. using drones). The
latter case is clearly more time consuming but can provide enhanced detail,
particularly where coverage of virtual globe software is limited. The captured
images are then used to generate 3D background environment models employing
photogrammetry software. The reconstructed 3D models are then imported into the
simulation interface as background environment assets together with appropriate
foreground object models as a basis for shot planning and rehearsal. The tool
supports both free-flight and parameterisable standard shot types along with
programmable scenarios associated with foreground assets and event dynamics. It
also supports the exporting of flight plans. Camera shots can also be designed

offering discounts to influential users (called seeding). In many applications,
due to user's privacy concern, overwhelming network scale etc., it is hard to
target any user in the network as one wishes. Instead, only a small subset of
users is initially accessible. Such access limitation would significantly
impair the influence spread, since IM often relies on seeding high degree
users, which are particularly rare in such a small subset due to the power-law
structure of social networks. In this paper, we attempt to solve the limited IM
in real-world scenarios by the adaptive approach with seeding and diffusion
uncertainty considered. Specifically, we consider fine-grained discounts and
assume users accept the discount probabilistically. The diffusion process is
depicted by the independent cascade model. To overcome the access limitation,
we prove the set-wise friendship paradox (FP) phenomenon that neighbors have
higher degree in expectation, and propose a two-stage seeding model with the FP
embedded, where neighbors are seeded. On this basis, for comparison we
formulate the non-adaptive case and adaptive case, both proven to be NP-hard.
In the non-adaptive case, discounts are allocated to users all at once. We show
the monotonicity of influence spread w.r.t. discount allocation and design a
two-stage coordinate descent framework to decide the discount allocation. In
the adaptive case, users are sequentially seeded based on observations of
existing seeding and diffusion results. We prove the adaptive submodularity and
submodularity of the influence spread function in two stages. Then, a series of
adaptive greedy algorithms are proposed with constant approximation ratio.

different dielectric environments. It is shown that, in the highly screened
regime, short-range interactions (both intra- and inter-band) can be very
relevant, while they lose importance when there is no screening other than the
one proper of the bulk silicon crystal. In the latter case, we predict the
formation of hole Wigner molecules.

for clustering, with properties suitable for statistical inference. In this
paper, we propose a new model-based clustering algorithm, called EGMM
(evidential GMM), in the theoretical framework of belief functions to better
characterize cluster-membership uncertainty. With a mass function representing
the cluster membership of each object, the evidential Gaussian mixture
distribution composed of the components over the powerset of the desired
clusters is proposed to model the entire dataset. The parameters in EGMM are
estimated by a specially designed Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. A
validity index allowing automatic determination of the proper number of
clusters is also provided. The proposed EGMM is as simple as the classical GMM,
but can generate a more informative evidential partition for the considered
dataset. The synthetic and real dataset experiments show that the proposed EGMM
performs better than other representative clustering algorithms. Besides, its
superiority is also demonstrated by an application to multi-modal brain image
segmentation.

Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) has been confirmed by the discovery of the association
of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW170817 with GRB 170817A. However, the
merger product of binary NS remains an open question. An X-ray plateau followed
by a steep decay (""internal plateau"") has been found in some short GRBs,
implying that a supra-massive magnetar operates as the merger remnant and then
collapses into a newborn black hole (BH) at the end of the plateau. X-ray bump
or second-plateau following the ""internal plateau"" is considered as the
expected signature from the fallback accretion onto this newborn BH through
Blandford-Znajek mechanism (BZ). At the same time, a nearly isotropic wind
driven by Blandford-Paynemechanism (BP) from the newborn BH's disk can produce
a bright kilonova. Therefore, the bright kilonova observation for a short GRB
with ""internal plateau"" (and followed by X-ray bump or second-plateau) provides
further evidence for this scenario. In this paper, we find that GRB 160821B is
a candidate of such a case, and the kilonova emission of GRB 160821B is
possibly powered by the BP wind from a newborn BH. Future GW detection of GRB
160821B-like events may provide further support to this scenario, enable us to
investigate the properties of the magnetar and the newborn BH, and constrain
the equation of state of neutron stars.

IRSs affect the performance of multi-user full-duplex communication systems

uplink users are subject to maximum transmission power constraints. Firstly,
the uplink-downlink system weighted sum-rate (SWSR) is derived which serves as
a system performance metric. Then, we formulate the resource allocation design
for the maximization of SWSR as an optimization problem which jointly optimizes
the beamforming and the combining vectors at the BS, the transmit powers of the
uplink users, and the phase shifts of multiple IRSs. Since the SWSR
optimization problem is non-convex, an efficient iterative alternating approach
is proposed to obtain a suboptimal solution for the design problem considered
and its complexity is also discussed. In particular, we firstly reformulate the
main problem into an equivalent weighted minimum mean-square-error form and
then transform it into several convex sub-problems which can be analytically
solved for given phase shifts. Then, the IRSs phases are optimized via a
gradient ascent-based algorithm. Finally, numerical results are presented to
clarify how multiple IRSs enhance the performance metric under hardware

important strand of machine learning and computer vision research. Deep models
require sizeable computational complexity and storage, when used for instance
for Human Action Recognition (HAR) from videos, making them unsuitable to be
deployed on edge devices. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a
method to effectively compress Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as Gated
Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Long-Short-Term-Memory Units (LSTMs) that are used
for HAR. We use a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory-based pruning
approach to limit the information flow through the sequential cells of RNNs to
a small subset. Further, we combine our pruning method with a specific
group-lasso regularization technique that significantly improves compression.
The proposed techniques reduce model parameters and memory footprint from
latent representations, with little or no reduction in the validation accuracy
while increasing the inference speed several-fold. We perform experiments on
the three widely used Action Recognition datasets, viz. UCF11, HMDB51, and
UCF101, to validate our approach. It is shown that our method achieves over 70
times greater compression than the nearest competitor with comparable accuracy
for the task of action recognition on UCF11.

models. We study under which conditions spontaneous sustained chemical
oscillations are possible, and what kind of biffurcations lead to, or quench,
the occurrence of such oscillations. Methods. The well known Ordinary
Differential Equations (ODE) integrator VODE is used to explore initial
conditions and parameter space in a gas phase chemical model of a dark
interstellar cloud. We recall that the time evolution of the various chemical
abundances under fixed temperature conditions depends on the density over
cosmic ionization rate nH/{\zeta} ratio. We also report the occurrence of
naturally sustained oscillations for a limited but well defined range of
control parameters. The period of oscillations is within the range of
characteristic time scales of interstellar processes and could lead to
spectacular resonances in time dependent models. Reservoir species (C, CO, NH3,
...) oscillation amplitudes are generally less than a factor two. However,
these amplitudes reach a factor ten to thousand for low abundance species, e.g.
HCN, ND3, that may play a key role for diagnostic purposes.The mechanism
responsible for oscillations is tightly linked to the chemistry of nitrogen,

significant open questions in astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics.
We study some of the salient areas of $\gamma$-ray cosmology that can be
explored as part of the Key Science Projects of CTA, through simulated
observations of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and of their relativistic jets.
Observations of AGN with CTA will enable a measurement of $\gamma$-ray
absorption on the extragalactic background light with a statistical uncertainty
below 15% up to a redshift $z=2$ and to constrain or detect $\gamma$-ray halos
up to intergalactic-magnetic-field strengths of at least 0.3pG. Extragalactic
observations with CTA also show promising potential to probe physics beyond the
Standard Model. The best limits on Lorentz invariance violation from
$\gamma$-ray astronomy will be improved by a factor of at least two to three.
CTA will also probe the parameter space in which axion-like particles could
constitute a significant fraction, if not all, of dark matter. We conclude on
the synergies between CTA and other upcoming facilities that will foster the
growth of $\gamma$-ray cosmology.

problems. We argue that these challenges arise in part due to the intrinsic
rigidity of operating at the level of actions. Actions can precisely define how
to perform an activity but are ill-suited to describe what activity to perform.
Instead, causal effects are inherently composable and temporally abstract,
making them ideal for descriptive tasks. By leveraging a hierarchy of causal
effects, this study aims to expedite the learning of task-specific behavior and
aid exploration. Borrowing counterfactual and normality measures from causal
literature, we disentangle controllable effects from effects caused by other
dynamics of the environment. We propose CEHRL, a hierarchical method that
models the distribution of controllable effects using a Variational
Autoencoder. This distribution is used by a high-level policy to 1) explore the
environment via random effect exploration so that novel effects are
continuously discovered and learned, and to 2) learn task-specific behavior by
prioritizing the effects that maximize a given reward function. In comparison
to exploring with random actions, experimental results show that random effect
exploration is a more efficient mechanism and that by assigning credit to few
effects rather than many actions, CEHRL learns tasks more rapidly.

algorithm and its variants. However in many problems, especially those arising
in communications and signal processing, information beyond the stochastic

extra-gradient information is not used by SGD, but has been shown to be useful,
for instance in the context of stochastic expectation-maximization, stochastic
majorization-minimization, and stochastic successive convex approximation (SCA)
approaches. By constructing a stochastic strongly convex surrogates of the loss
function at every iteration, the stochastic SCA algorithms can exploit the
structural properties of the loss function and achieve superior empirical
performance as compared to the SGD.

develop its asynchronous variant which can be used for resource allocation in
wireless networks. While the stochastic SCA algorithm is known to converge
asymptotically, its iteration complexity has not been well-studied, and is the
focus of the current work. The insights obtained from the non-asymptotic
analysis allow us to develop a more practical asynchronous variant of the
stochastic SCA algorithm which allows the use of surrogates calculated in
earlier iterations. We characterize precise bound on the maximum delay the
algorithm can tolerate, while still achieving the same convergence rate. We
apply the algorithm to the problem of linear precoding in wireless sensor
networks, where it can be implemented at low complexity but is shown to perform

decrease the transaction costs at a collective level. This can be achieved
using information systems for: identifying potential synergies, evaluating

integrated method rooted in cooperative game theory and multiagent systems
research to develop a fair and stable allocation mechanism for it. The novelty
is twofold: in developing analytical multiagent methods for capturing the
dynamics of transaction costs in industrial symbiosis and in presenting a novel
game-theoretic mechanism for its allocation in industrial symbiosis
institutions. While the former contributes to the theories of industrial
symbiosis (methodological contribution), the latter supports decision makers

time-varying wireless channels and stochastic user task data arrivals in
sequential time frames. In particular, we aim to design an online computation
offloading algorithm to maximize the network data processing capability subject
to the long-term data queue stability and average power constraints. The online
algorithm is practical in the sense that the decisions for each time frame are
made without the assumption of knowing future channel conditions and data
arrivals. We formulate the problem as a multi-stage stochastic mixed integer
non-linear programming (MINLP) problem that jointly determines the binary
offloading (each user computes the task either locally or at the edge server)
and system resource allocation decisions in sequential time frames. To address
the coupling in the decisions of different time frames, we propose a novel
framework, named LyDROO, that combines the advantages of Lyapunov optimization
and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, LyDROO first applies
Lyapunov optimization to decouple the multi-stage stochastic MINLP into
deterministic per-frame MINLP subproblems. By doing so, it guarantees to
satisfy all the long-term constraints by solving the per-frame subproblems that
are much smaller in size. Then, LyDROO integrates model-based optimization and
model-free DRL to solve the per-frame MINLP problems with low computational
complexity. Simulation results show that under various network setups, the
proposed LyDROO achieves optimal computation performance while stabilizing all
queues in the system. Besides, it induces very low execution latency that is
particularly suitable for real-time implementation in fast fading environments.

with the variational distribution locating high posterior density regions, the
Markov chain is optimized within the variational inference framework to

chain in MIVI admits extrapolation, which means its marginal distribution gets

some rational approximation of $A^{-\alpha}$. In this paper we present the main
ideas of these methods and the corresponding algorithms, discuss their
accuracy, computational complexity and compare their efficiency and robustness.

control a flexible, elastic Cosserat rod model of a single octopus arm. The
novel contributions of this work are two-fold: (i) a control-oriented modeling
of the anatomically realistic internal muscular architecture of an octopus arm;
and (ii) the integration of these muscle models into the energy shaping control
methodology. The control-oriented modeling takes inspiration in equal parts
from theories of nonlinear elasticity and energy shaping control. By
introducing a stored energy function for muscles, the difficulties associated
with explicitly solving the matching conditions of the energy shaping
methodology are avoided. The overall control design problem is posed as a
bilevel optimization problem. Its solution is obtained through iterative
algorithms. The methodology is numerically implemented and demonstrated in a
full-scale dynamic simulation environment Elastica. Two bio-inspired numerical
experiments involving the control of octopus arms are reported.

"2010.03958","Sebastian Otte","Sebastian Otte, Matthias Karlbauer, Martin V. Butz","Active Tuning",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce Active Tuning, a novel paradigm for optimizing the internal
dynamics of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) on the fly. In contrast to the
conventional sequence-to-sequence mapping scheme, Active Tuning decouples the
RNN's recurrent neural activities from the input stream, using the unfolding
temporal gradient signal to tune the internal dynamics into the data stream. As
a consequence, the model output depends only on its internal hidden dynamics
and the closed-loop feedback of its own predictions; its hidden state is
continuously adapted by means of the temporal gradient resulting from
backpropagating the discrepancy between the signal observations and the model
outputs through time. In this way, Active Tuning infers the signal actively but
indirectly based on the originally learned temporal patterns, fitting the most
plausible hidden state sequence into the observations. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of Active Tuning on several time series prediction benchmarks,
including multiple super-imposed sine waves, a chaotic double pendulum, and
spatiotemporal wave dynamics. Active Tuning consistently improves the
robustness, accuracy, and generalization abilities of all evaluated models.
Moreover, networks trained for signal prediction and denoising can be
successfully applied to a much larger range of noise conditions with the help
of Active Tuning. Thus, given a capable time series predictor, Active Tuning
enhances its online signal filtering, denoising, and reconstruction abilities
without the need for additional training.

emerging field in studying superconductivity. Here we show that the Berry
curvature and the quantum metric of bands play a central role in the Higgs mode
generation. They allow the detection of Higgs bosons even when the conventional
contribution from the band curvature vanishes. Furthermore, we show that the
Higgs mode can couple to the external electromagnetic field linearly when
mediated by the Berry connection. As a result, we predict the existence of a
second harmonic generation, in addition to the well-known third harmonic
generation. We elucidate our theory further by considering a flat band
superconductor realized by the Harper-Hubbard model and show that the geometric
Higgs mode is lower bounded by the band Chern number. We demonstrate in twisted
bilayer graphene the existence of the geometrically induced Higgs modes when
superconductivity is realized in the nearly flat band at the magic angle.

gained enormous prominence over the years, primarily in the field of medical
science. Detection and/or partitioning of brain tumors solely with the aid of
MR imaging is achieved at the cost of immense time and effort and demands a lot
of expertise from engaged personnel. This substantiates the necessity of
fabricating an autonomous model brain tumor diagnosis. Our work involves
implementing a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for diagnosing brain
tumors from MR images. The dataset used in this paper consists of 253 brain MR
images where 155 images are reported to have tumors. Our model can single out
the MR images with tumors with an overall accuracy of 96%. The model
outperformed the existing conventional methods for the diagnosis of brain tumor
in the test dataset (Precision = 0.93, Sensitivity = 1.00, and F1-score =
0.97). Moreover, the proposed model's average precision-recall score is 0.93,
Cohen's Kappa 0.91, and AUC 0.95. Therefore, the proposed model can help
clinical experts verify whether the patient has a brain tumor and,
consequently, accelerate the treatment procedure.
