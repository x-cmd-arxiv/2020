state-of-mind which some refer to as flow. Breaking out of this flow can cause
the developer to lose their train of thought and have to start their thought
process from the beginning. This loss of thought can be caused by interruptions
and sometimes slow IDE interactions. Predictive functionality has been
harnessed in user applications to speed up load times, such as in Google
Chrome's browser which has a feature called ""Predicting Network Actions"". This
will pre-load web-pages that the user is most likely to click through. This
mitigates the interruption that load times can introduce. In this paper we seek
to make the first step towards predicting user commands in the IDE. Using the
MSR 2018 Challenge Data of over 3000 developer session and over 10 million
recorded events, we analyze and cleanse the data to be parsed into event
series, which can then be used to train a variety of machine learning models,
including a neural network, to predict user induced commands. Our highest
performing model is able to obtain a 5 cross-fold validation prediction

industry-representative deep recommendation models at three different levels of
the execution stack: algorithms and software, systems platforms, and hardware

that system deployment choices (i.e., CPUs or GPUs, batch size granularity) can
give us up to 15x speedup. To better understand the bottlenecks for further
optimization, we look at both software operator usage breakdown and CPU
frontend and backend microarchitectural inefficiencies. Finally, we model the
correlation between key algorithmic model architecture features and hardware

system. Simulation has been recognized as the only way to deal with the study
of the emergency of properties (at a macroscopic level) among groups of system
components (at a microscopic level), for the manifestations of emergent
structures cannot be deduced from analysing components in isolation. A
systems-oriented generalisation must consider the presence of feedback loops
(micro components react to macro properties), interaction among components of
different classes (modular composition) and layered interaction of subsystems
operating at different spatio-temporal scales (hierarchical organisation). In
this work we introduce Emergent Behavior-DEVS (EB-DEVS) a Modeling and
Simulation (M&S) formalism that permits reasoning about complex systems where
emergent behavior is placed at the forefront of the analysis activity. EB-DEVS
builds on the DEVS formalism, adding upward/downward communication channels to
well-established capabilities for modular and hierarchical M&S of heterogeneous
multi-formalism systems. EB-DEVS takes a minimalist stance on expressiveness,
introducing a small set of extensions on Classic DEVS that can cope with
emergent behavior, and making both formalisms interoperable (the modeler
decides which subsystems deserve to be expressed via micro-macro dynamics). We
present three case studies: flocks of birds with learning, population epidemics
with vaccination and sub-cellular dynamics with homeostasis, through which we
showcase how EB-DEVS performs by placing emergent properties at the center of
the M&S process.

an orthonormal basis. Here we discuss what can be done when these sets are
replaced by Parseval frames. This interest is motivated by physical reasons,
and in particular by the fact that the {\em mathematical } Hilbert space where
the physical system is originally defined, contains sometimes also states which
cannot really be occupied by the {\em physical} system itself. In particular,
we show what changes in the spectrum of the observables, when going from
orthonormal bases to Parseval frames. In this perspective we propose the notion
of $E$-connection for observables. Several examples are discussed.

use ventricular geometry with fiber-orientation details and employ a
physiologically realistic model for a canine ventricular myocyte. We restrict
ourselves to an HRD-model parameter regime, which does not produce spiral- and
scroll-wave instabilities because of other,well-studied causes like a very
sharp action-potential-duration-restitution (APDR) curve or early after
depolarizations(EADs) at the single-cell level. We find that spiral- or
scroll-wave dynamics are affected predominantly by a simultaneous change in
$I_{CaL}$ and $I_{Kr}$,rather than by a change in any one of these
currents;other currents do not have such a large effect on these wave dynamics
in this parameter regime of the HRD model.We obtain stability diagrams in the
$G_{Kr} -\gamma_{Cao}$ plane.In the 3D domain,the geometry of the domain
supports the confinement of the scroll waves and makes them more stable
compared to their spiral-wave counterparts in 2D domain. We have also carried
out a comparison of our HRD results with their counterparts for the

these models,to make a transition,(from broken-wave to stable-scroll states or

understanding of everything from moon phases, the planets in our Solar System,
and exoplanet atmospheres come from our interpretation of light and one day,
our knowledge of light will be used as evidence for the discovery of life on
another planet.
  In the time before we scattered rovers, landers, and brave souls across the
Solar System we only knew of the planets and moons from the light they
reflected from the Sun back to us. We are in much the same situation with
exoplanets today. Our telescopes can gather the light from distant worlds but
they are too far out of reach to confirm our observations with in-situ
measurements. Soon we will be able to gather light from even smaller exoplanets
and eventually Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting in their star's habitable zone.
As a reference guide to these upcoming observations what better place to
compare to than our own Solar System. What we've done is take measurements of
planets in our own Solar System and treat them as exoplanets to determine how
different surface types can be differentiated. The result is a database of the
spectra, geometric albedos, and color of 19 Solar System objects for use as an
exoplanetary field guide.
  A step beyond the field guide is a way to explore worlds only physics and our
imaginations are limited by. By using computer models, we can create thousands
of planets to determine the physical and chemical stability of any environment.
One parameter domain of interest is the role of surface color on a planet's
habitability. Different materials have unique thermal properties that either
cool or heat a surface depending on their color and the light that hits them.
Dark oceans absorb light well and heat up while white sand is highly reflective
and keeps cool...

with $-11/3$ at scales smaller than the ion characteristic scales, steeper than
what is typically observed in the solar wind and in the Earth's magnetosheath.
We explain such behavior by developing a simple two-fluid model which does not
require any kinetic processes nor electron-inertia effects. This is
characterized by a significant contribution of the ion kinetic energy to the
total turbulent energy cascade at sub-ion scales, although the dynamics is
driven by the magnetic field through the current density. We expect that this

learning models with training data distributed across multiple devices. Most of
the previous works about federated learning focus on the privacy protection and
communication cost reduction. However, how to achieve fairness in federated
learning is under-explored and challenging especially when testing data
distribution is different from training distribution or even unknown.
Introducing simple fairness constraints on the centralized model cannot achieve
model fairness on unknown testing data. In this paper, we develop a
fairness-aware agnostic federated learning framework (AgnosticFair) to deal
with the challenge of unknown testing distribution. We use kernel reweighing
functions to assign a reweighing value on each training sample in both loss
function and fairness constraint. Therefore, the centralized model built from
AgnosticFair can achieve high accuracy and fairness guarantee on unknown
testing data. Moreover, the built model can be directly applied to local sites
as it guarantees fairness on local data distributions. To our best knowledge,
this is the first work to achieve fairness in federated learning. Experimental
results on two real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness in terms of both
utility and fairness under data shift scenarios.

firefighters protect $k$ vertices that are not on fire, and on each subsequent
odd turn, any vertex that is on fire spreads the fire to all adjacent
unprotected vertices. The firefighters' goal is to eventually stop the spread
of the fire. If there exists a strategy for $k$ firefighters to eventually stop
the spread of the fire, then we say $G$ is $k$-containable.
  We consider the firefighter problem on the hexagonal grid, which is the graph
whose vertices and edges are exactly the vertices and edges of a regular
hexagonal tiling of the plane. It is not known if the hexagonal grid is
$1$-containable. In arXiv:1305.7076 [math.CO], it was shown that if the

showing that even with only one extra firefighter on one turn, the firefighters
can still contain the fire.
  In addition, we explore $k$-containability for birth sequence trees, which
are infinite rooted trees that have the property that every vertex at the same
level has the same degree. A birth sequence forest is an infinite forest, each
component of which is a birth sequence tree. For birth sequence trees and

pseudopolynomial time algorithm to decide if all the vertices at a fixed level

investigate the collapse in the case of the parabolic solution for the
effective scale factor of the Lema{\^i}tre-Tolman-Bondi metric, corresponding
to the marginally bound case. Exploring the corresponding cut-offs at which
gravity becomes repulsive, we notice that black holes with dominant repulsive
effects are not excluded \emph{a priori}. Indeed, we demonstrate that the
collapse leads, in general, to the formation of a central naked singularity;
however, for particular values of the free parameters entering the model, black
holes with dominant repulsive gravity can exist. We show that the expected

the energy-momentum tensor is built up in terms of pressureless matter.

early matter-dominated era, whereas the parameter space required to explain the
NANOGrav observation in the standard cosmology or in the nonstandard epoch of
kination domination is ruled out by the BBN and CMB observations. For the
second-order GWs arising from the large primordial scalar fluctuations, we
study the standard radiation domination and two specific nonstandard cases with
a few forms of the primordial power spectrum $P_{\zeta}(k)$ to achieve abundant
primordial black hole (PBH) production. We find that the NANOGrav observation
can be explained with standard radiation domination for all of these
$P_{\zeta}(k)$. Furthermore, a dustlike epoch leads to abundant PBH formation
for a lower amplitude of $P_{\zeta}(k)$ than the radiation dominated case and
complies with the NANOGrav observation only for a few of the all $P_{\zeta}(k)$
forms considered here, where the peak wavenumber is larger than the wavenumber
range probed by the NANOGrav. In this nonstandard epoch, for a broad power
spectrum, PBHs are produced in a wide mass range in the planetary mass regime.

more than 33 million confirmed infections and more than 1 million reported
deaths worldwide. Several statistical, machine learning, and hybrid models have
previously tried to forecast COVID-19 confirmed cases for profoundly affected
countries. Due to extreme uncertainty and nonstationarity in the time series
data, forecasting of COVID-19 confirmed cases has become a very challenging
job. For univariate time series forecasting, there are various statistical and
machine learning models available in the literature. But, epidemic forecasting
has a dubious track record. Its failures became more prominent due to
insufficient data input, flaws in modeling assumptions, high sensitivity of

evidence on effects of available interventions, lack of transparency, errors,
lack of determinacy, and lack of expertise in crucial disciplines. This chapter
focuses on assessing different short-term forecasting models that can forecast
the daily COVID-19 cases for various countries. In the form of an empirical
study on forecasting accuracy, this chapter provides evidence to show that
there is no universal method available that can accurately forecast pandemic

equations (modified Burgers-Hilbert and Whitham). They have the advantage with
respect to the usual fractional KdV equation to have a defocusing case with a
different dynamics. We will distinguish the weakly dispersive case where the
phase velocity is unbounded for low frequencies and tends to zero at infinity
and the strongly dispersive case where the phase velocity vanishes at the
origin and goes to infinity at infinity. In the former case, the nonlinear
hyperbolic effects dominate for large data, leading to the possibility of shock
formation though the dispersive effects manifest for small initial data where
scattering is possible. In the latter case, finite time blow-up is possible in
the focusing case but not the shock formation. In the defocusing case global
existence and scattering is expected in the energy subcritical case, while
finite time blow-up is expected in the energy supercritical case.
  We establish rigorously the existence of shocks with blow-up time and
location being explicitly computed in the weakly dispersive case, while most of
the results on the strongly dispersive case are derived via numerical
simulations, for large solutions. Moreover, the shock formation result can be
extended to the weakly dispersive equation with some generalized nonlinearity.

sound statistical analysis for monitoring mortality patterns and trends over
time. Excess mortality has been suggested as the most appropriate indicator to
measure the overall burden of the pandemic on mortality. As such, excess
mortality has received considerable interest during the first months of the
COVID-19 pandemic. Previous approaches to estimate excess mortality are
somewhat limited, as they do not include sufficiently long-term trends,
correlations among different demographic and geographic groups, and the
autocorrelations in the mortality time series. This might lead to biased
estimates of excess mortality, as random mortality fluctuations may be
misinterpreted as excess mortality. We present a blend of classical
epidemiological approaches to estimating excess mortality during extraordinary
events with an established demographic approach in mortality forecasting,
namely a Lee-Carter type model, which covers the named limitations and draws a
more realistic picture of the excess mortality. We illustrate our approach
using weekly age- and sex-specific mortality data for 19 countries and the
current COVID-19 pandemic as a case study. Our proposed model provides a
general framework that can be applied to future pandemics as well as to monitor
excess mortality from specific causes of deaths.

with local interstellar medium values. We also performed an image analysis and
find that the spatial distribution of the counts is not consistent with that of
a point source. The hypothesis of a point source distribution can be rejected

important information and apply simple domain rules on the extracted

promising (recall of 89.62% for classifying brain region and 74.11% for

computing. This paper presents a novel algorithm for approximate byzantine
consensus, called Relay-ABC. The algorithm allows machines to achieve
approximate consensus to arbitrary exactness in the presence of byzantine
failures. The algorithm relies on the usage of a relayed messaging system and
signed messages with unforgeable signatures that are unique to each node. The
use of signatures and relays allows the strict necessary network conditions of
traditional approximate byzantine consensus algorithms to be circumvented.
  We also provide theoretical guarantees of validity and convergence for
Relay-ABC. To do this, we utilize the idea that the iteration of states in the
network can be modeled by a sequence of transition matrices. We extend previous
methods, which use transition matrices to prove ABC convergence, by having each
state vector model not just one iteration, but a set of $D$ iterations, where
$D$ is a diameter property of the graph. This allows us to accurately model the
delays of messages inherent within the relay system.

that this software will be easier to develop and maintain, that it remains
available in the future on new platforms, that it meets new needs, and that it
is as reusable as possible. This report discusses a virtual half-day workshop
on ""Software Sustainability and High Energy Physics"" that aimed 1) to bring
together experts from HEP as well as those from outside to share their
experiences and practices, and 2) to articulate a vision that helps the
Institute for Research and Innovation in Software for High Energy Physics

sustainability. Software sustainability practices could lead to new
collaborations, including elements of HEP software being directly used outside
the field, and, as has happened more frequently in recent years, to HEP
developers contributing to software developed outside the field rather than
reinventing it. A focus on and skills related to sustainable software will give
HEP software developers an important skill that is essential to careers in the

recipients who have incompatible donors. On the other hand, patients who do not
have a living donor depend upon deceased donor (DD) donations to get a kidney
transplant. Currently, in India a deceased donor donates kidneys directly to a
deceased donor wait-list. The idea of initiating an exchange chain starting
from a deceased donor kidney is proposed in a few articles (and recently
executed in Italy), but no mathematical formulation has been given for this
merger. We have introduced an integer programming formulation that creates
deceased donor initiated chains, considering both paired exchange registry and
deceased donor allocations simultaneously. There is a possibility of overlap
between paired exchange registry and deceased donor wait-list registry data as
recipients can register for both registries independently. This has also been
addressed in the paper. A long term simulation study is done to analyze the
gain of these DD initiated chains over time. It suggests that even with small
numbers of deceased donors, these chains can increases the number of potential
transplants significantly. Also, waiting time and dropout rates in the merged
registry decreases substantially.

impact that the chemical composition of the cold and dense core has on the
final composition of the disk. We performed 3D nonideal magneto-hydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations of a dense core collapse using the adaptive-mesh-refinement
RAMSES code. For each particle ending in the young rotationally supported disk,
we ran chemical simulations with the three-phase gas-grain chemistry code
Nautilus. Two different sets of initial abundances, which are characteristic of
cold cores, were considered. The final distributions of the abundances of
common species were compared to each other, as well as with the initial
abundances of the cold core. We find that the spatial distributions of
molecules reflect their sensitivity to the temperature distribution. The main
carriers of the chemical elements in the disk are usually the same as the ones
in the cold core, except for the S-bearing species, where HS is replaced by
H$_2$S$_3$, and the P-bearing species, where atomic P leads to the formation of
PO, PN, HCP, and CP. However, the abundances of less abundant species change
over time. This is especially the case for ""large"" complex organic molecules
(COMs) such as CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$NH$_2$, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, and HCOOCH$_3$ which see
their abundances significantly increase during the collapse. These COMs often
present similar abundances in the disk despite significantly different
abundances in the cold core. In contrast, the abundances of many radicals
decrease with time. A significant number of species still show the same
abundances in the cold core and the disk, which indicates efficient formation
of these molecules in the cold core. This includes H$_2$O, H$_2$CO, HNCO, and

interaction between vehicles and pedestrians. In the absence of a driver, it is
not clear how an AV can communicate its intention to pedestrians. One option is
to use visual signals. To advance their design, we conduct four
human-participant experiments and evaluate six representative AV visual signals
for visibility, intuitiveness, persuasiveness, and usability at pedestrian
crossings. Based on the results, we distill twelve practical design
recommendations for AV visual signals, with focus on signal pattern design and
placement. Moreover, the paper advances the methodology for experimental
evaluation of visual signals, including lab, closed-course, and public road
tests using an autonomous vehicle. In addition, the paper also reports insights
on pedestrian crosswalk behaviours and the impacts of pedestrian trust towards
AVs on the behaviors. We hope that this work will constitute valuable input to
the ongoing development of international standards for AV lamps, and thus help
mature automated driving in general.

  the Non-Mean Field Problem of COVID-19","19 pages, 21 figures, 1 table",,,,"q-bio.PE physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The concept of the effective infection opportunity population (EIOP) was
incorporated into the SIQR model, and it was assumed that this EIOP would
change with the spread of infection, and this was named as the effective SIQR
model. When calculated with this model, the uninfected population S decreases
with the passage of time. However, when the EIOP N increases because of any
reason, the infection threshold becomes larger than 1. Even after the first
wave seems to have subsided, the infection begins to spread again. Firstly, we
find the curve of EIOP change so that the calculation result by this model
matches the data of the first and second waves. Then, we use this curve to fit
with only the data of the second wave alone, and the third wave is predicted.
In the case of new coronavirus infection, there are various restrictions on
data collection to identify individual coefficients of mathematical models, and
the true value is almost unknown. Therefore, the discussion in this paper is
only about data fitting for predictive calculation. Therefore, the simulation
on the true value is not aimed. However, since the data of infected persons
reflect the true values, the results of data fitting can be used for the
prediction of infected persons, isolated care recipients, inpatients, and
severely ill persons. They are useful for a qualitative understanding of
infection. The idea of EIOP is important in the sense that it connects the
mean-field and the non-mean field, but the existence of data is essential, and
the theory alone cannot simulate the non-mean field. We have developed two
methods for treating the non-mean field cases where we don't have enough data.
We have briefly introduced them.

credibly identify causal effects, but often suffer from limited scale, while
observational datasets are large, but often violate desired identification

experimental and observational datasets when 1) units from these two datasets
are similar and 2) some characteristics of these units are observed. I show
that if these characteristics can partially explain treatment assignment in the
observational data, they can be used to derive moment restrictions that, in
combination with the experimental data, improve estimation efficiency. I
outline three estimators (weighting, shrinkage, or GMM) for implementing this
strategy, and show that my methods can reduce variance by up to 50% in typical
experimental designs; therefore, only half of the experimental sample is
required to attain the same statistical precision. If researchers are allowed
to design experiments differently, I show that they can further improve the
precision by directly leveraging this correlation between characteristics and

studies the causal effect of search rankings, and show that the method can
substantially improve the precision.

rare. Synthetically generated anomalies are a solution to such ill or not fully

two-level hierarchical latent space representation that distills inliers'
feature-descriptors (through autoencoders) into more robust representations
based on a variational family of distributions (through a variational
autoencoder) for zero-shot anomaly generation. From the learned latent
distributions, we select those that lie on the outskirts of the training data
as synthetic-outlier generators. And, we synthesize from them, i.e., generate
negative samples without seen them before, to train binary classifiers. We
found that the use of the proposed hierarchical structure for feature
distillation and fusion creates robust and general representations that allow
us to synthesize pseudo outlier samples. And in turn, train robust binary
classifiers for true outlier detection (without the need for actual outliers
during training). We demonstrate the performance of our proposal on several
benchmarks for anomaly detection.

solves some of the remaining open cases of the connectivity estimates of
Goodwillie and Klein, and on the other hand, it confirms one half of the
conjecture by Budney, Conant, Scannell and Sinha that for classical knots
$ev_n$ are universal additive Vassiliev invariants over the integers.
  We actually study long knots in any manifold of dimension at least $3$ and
develop a geometric understanding of the layers in the embedding calculus tower
and their first non-trivial homotopy groups, given as certain groups of
decorated trees. Moreover, in dimension $3$ we give an explicit interpretation
of $ev_n$ using capped grope cobordisms and our joint work with Shi and
Teichner.
  The main theorem of the present paper says that the first possibly
non-vanishing embedding calculus invariant $ev_n$ of a knot which is grope
cobordant to the unknot is precisely the equivalence class of the underlying
decorated tree of the grope in the homotopy group of the layer.
  As a corollary, we give a sufficient condition for the mentioned conjecture
to hold over a coefficient group. By recent results of Boavida de Brito and
Horel this is fulfilled for the rationals, and for the $p$-adic integers in a
range, confirming that the embedding calculus invariants are universal rational
additive Vassiliev invariants, factoring configuration space integrals.

data, we introduce and study {\em stochastic minimum-norm optimization}. We
have an underlying combinatorial optimization problem where the costs involved
are {\em random variables} with given distributions; each feasible solution
induces a random multidimensional cost vector, and given a certain objective
function, the goal is to find a solution (that does not depend on the
realizations of the costs) that minimizes the expected objective value. For
instance, in stochastic load balancing, jobs with random processing times need
to be assigned to machines, and the induced cost vector is the machine-load
vector. Recently, in the deterministic setting, Chakrabarty and Swamy
\cite{ChakrabartyS19a} considered a fairly broad suite of objectives, wherein
we seek to minimize the $f$-norm of the cost vector under a given {\em
arbitrary monotone, symmetric norm} $f$. In stochastic minimum-norm
optimization, we work with this broad class of objectives, and seek a solution
that minimizes the {\em expected $f$-norm} of the induced cost vector.
  We give a general framework for devising algorithms for stochastic
minimum-norm combinatorial optimization, using which we obtain approximation
algorithms for the stochastic minimum-norm versions of the load balancing and
spanning tree problems. Two key technical contributions of this work are: (1) a
structural result of independent interest connecting stochastic minimum-norm
optimization to the simultaneous optimization of a (\emph{small}) collection of
expected $\mathsf{Top}$-$\ell$-norms; and (2) showing how to tackle expected
$\mathsf{Top}$-$\ell$-norm minimization by leveraging techniques used to deal
with minimizing the expected maximum, circumventing the difficulties posed by

with humans in the real world, and human motion has the nature of
multi-granularity. However, most of the existing work either implicitly modeled
multi-granularity information via fixed modes or focused on modeling a single
granularity, making it hard to well capture this nature for accurate
predictions. In contrast, we propose a novel end-to-end network, Semi-Decoupled
Multi-grained Trajectory Learning network (SDMTL), to predict future poses,
which not only flexibly captures rich multi-grained trajectory information but
also aggregates multi-granularity information for predictions. Specifically, we
first introduce a Brain-inspired Semi-decoupled Motion-sensitive Encoding
module (BSME), effectively capturing spatiotemporal features in a
semi-decoupled manner. Then, we capture the temporal dynamics of motion
trajectory at multi-granularity, including fine granularity and coarse
granularity. We learn multi-grained trajectory information using BSMEs
hierarchically and further capture the information of temporal evolutional
directions at each granularity by gathering the outputs of BSMEs at each
granularity and applying temporal convolutions along the motion trajectory.
Next, the captured motion dynamics can be further enhanced by aggregating the
information of multi-granularity with a weighted summation scheme. Finally,
experimental results on two benchmarks, including Human3.6M and CMU-Mocap, show
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be available if the paper

Efimov-like states exhibit a discrete scaling symmetry and imply an
unprecedented apparatus for studying quantum anomaly using hyperbolic surfaces.
Furthermore, all eigenstates are exponentially localized in the hyperbolic
coordinates, signifying the first example of quantum funneling effects in
Hermitian systems. As such, any initial wave packet travels towards the edge of
the Poincar\'e half-plane or its equivalent on the Poincar\'e disk, delivering
an efficient scheme to harvest light and atoms in two dimensions. Our findings
unfold the intriguing properties of hyperbolic spaces and suggest that Efimov
states may be regarded as a projection from a curved space with an extra
dimension.

decisions on what and how to say about before making utterances. Guiding
surface realization with such high-level decisions and structuring text in a

learn such high-level coherence? A paragraph itself contains various forms of
inductive coherence signals called self-supervision in this work, such as
sentence orders, topical keywords, rhetorical structures, and so on. Motivated
by that, this work proposes a new paragraph completion task PARCOM; predicting

communication technologies, and it is considered one of the most implementable
systems of connected and automated vehicles, bringing huge energy savings and
safety improvements. Properly planning platoons and evaluating the potential of
truck platooning are crucial to trucking companies and transportation
authorities. This study proposes a series of data mining approaches to learn
spontaneous truck platooning patterns from massive trajectories. An enhanced
map matching algorithm is developed to identify truck headings by using digital
map data, followed by an adaptive spatial clustering algorithm to detect
instantaneous co-moving truck sets. These sets are then aggregated to find the
network-wide maximum platoon duration and size through frequent itemset mining
for computational efficiency. We leverage real GPS data collected from truck
fleeting systems in Liaoning Province, China, to evaluate platooning
performance and successfully extract spatiotemporal platooning patterns.
Results show that approximately 36% spontaneous truck platoons can be
coordinated by speed adjustment without changing routes and schedules. The
average platooning distance and duration ratios for these platooned trucks are
9.6% and 9.9%, respectively, leading to a 2.8% reduction in total fuel
consumption. We also distinguish the optimal platooning periods and space
headways for national freeways and trunk roads, and prioritize the road
segments with high possibilities of truck platooning. The derived results are
reproducible, providing useful policy implications and operational strategies
for large-scale truck platoon planning and roadside infrastructure

Combining the predicted future GW observations from DECIGO and three current
popular astrophysical probes (HII regions, SNe Ia Pantheon sample, quasar
sample) in electromagnetic (EM) domains, one would be able to probe the opacity
of the Universe at different redshifts. In this paper, we show that the cosmic
opacity parameter can be constrained to a high precision ($\Delta \epsilon\sim
10^{-2}$) out to high redshifts ($z\sim$5). In order to reconstruct the
evolution of cosmic opacity without assuming any particular functional form of
it, the cosmic opacity tests should be applied to individual redshift bins
independently. Therefore, we also calculate the optical depth at individual
redshifts and averaged $\tau(z)$ within redshift bins. Our findings indicate
that, compared with the results obtained from the HII galaxies and Pantheon SNe
Ia, there is an improvement in precision when the quasar sample is considered.
While non-zero optical depth is statistically significant only for redshift
ranges $0<z<0.5$, $1<z<2$, and $2.5<z<3.5$, such tendency is different from
that obtained in the framework of its parametrized form. Therefore the
importance of cosmic-opacity test without a prescribed phenomenological

multi-label classification problem. The problem is solved by proposing two
novel methods that primarily exploit the geometric relationship between the
feature vectors. The first one is an undersampling algorithm that uses angle
between feature vectors to select more informative samples while rejecting the
less informative ones. A suitable criterion is proposed to define the
informativeness of a given sample. The second one is an oversampling algorithm
that uses a generative algorithm to create new synthetic data that respects all
class boundaries. This is achieved by finding \emph{no man's land} based on
Euclidean distance between the feature vectors. The efficacy of the proposed
methods is analyzed by solving a generic multi-class recognition problem based
on mixture of Gaussians. The superiority of the proposed algorithms is
established through comparison with other state-of-the-art methods, including
SMOTE and ADASYN, over ten different publicly available datasets exhibiting
high-to-extreme data imbalance. These two methods are combined into a single
data processing framework and is labeled as ``GICaPS'' to highlight the role of
geometry-based information (GI) sampling and Class-Prioritized Synthesis (CaPS)
in dealing with multi-class data imbalance problem, thereby making a novel
contribution in this field.

hallmarks of the 21st century. The rise in cyber-crime, digital currency,

investment in new technology for securing computers around the globe. Recently,
business and government sectors have begun to focus efforts on comprehensive
cyber security solutions. With this growth has emerged the need for greater
methods of collabo-ration and measurement of security. Despite all these
efforts, this need has not been met, and there is still too little
cross-disciplinary collaboration in the realm of computer security. This paper
reviews the new trends in cyber security research, their contributions, and
some identifiable limitations. We argue that these limitations are due largely
to the absence of co-operation required to address a problem that is clearly
multifaceted. We then identify a need for further standardization of
terminology in computer security and propose guidelines for the global Internet
multistakeholder community to consider when crafting such standards. We also
assess the viability of some specific terms, including whether cyber should be
used as a separate word when it is a descriptor (e.g. cyber security or
cybersecurity), and conclude with recommendations for writing future papers on
cyber security or the broader new field of all things relating to cyberspace,
which has recently been dubbed Cybermatics, a term we also examine and propose
alternatives to, like Cyber or Cybernomics. By furthering the effort of
standardizing cyber security terminology, this paper lays groundwork for
cross-disciplinary collaboration, agreement between technical and nontechnical
stakeholders, and the drafting of universal Internet governance laws.

inactive in many deployment scenarios. We argue that additional data can be
transmitted in the skirts of the spectral mask imposed on the transmission
signal by regulation. To accomplish this task, we present a shaped wideband
single-carrier transmission using non-Nyquist pulse shapes. In particular, we
design spectrum-skirt filling (SSF) pulse shaping filters that follow the
spectral mask response, and perform detection using an accordingly increased
sampling frequency at the receiver. We evaluate the achievable information
rates of the SSF-based transmission considering practical dispersive channels
and non-ideal transmitter and receiver processing. To compensate for phase
noise impairments, we derive carrier phase tracking and estimation techniques,
and utilize them in tandem with nonlinear precoding which mitigates the
intersymbol interference introduced by the non-Nyquist SSF shaping filter.
Quantitative performance evaluations show that the proposed system design
achieves higher data rates in a dispersive microwave propagation environment
with respect to the conventional transmission with Nyquist pulse shaping.

we describe COnversational DYnamics Model (CODYM) analysis, a novel approach
for studying patterns of information flow in conversations. CODYMs are Markov
Models that capture sequential dependencies in the lengths of speaker turns.
The proposed method is automated and scalable, and preserves the privacy of the
conversational participants. The primary function of CODYM analysis is to
quantify and visualize patterns of information flow, concisely summarized over
sequential turns from one or more conversations. Our approach is general and
complements existing methods, providing a new tool for use in the analysis of
any type of conversation. As an important first application, we demonstrate the
model on transcribed conversations between palliative care clinicians and
seriously ill patients. These conversations are dynamic and complex, taking
place amidst heavy emotions, and include difficult topics such as end-of-life
preferences and patient values. We perform a versatile set of CODYM analyses
that (a) establish the validity of the model by confirming known patterns of
conversational turn-taking and word usage, (b) identify normative patterns of
information flow in serious illness conversations, and (c) show how these
patterns vary across narrative time and differ under expressions of anger, fear
and sadness. Potential applications of CODYMs range from assessment and
training of effective healthcare communication to comparing conversational
dynamics across language and culture, with the prospect of identifying
universal similarities and unique ""fingerprints"" of information flow.

adaptation to the data at a fine level. This can seem puzzling; in the worst
case, such models do not need to generalize. This puzzle inspired a great
amount of work, arguing when overparametrization reduces test error, in a
phenomenon called ""double descent"". Recent work aimed to understand in greater
depth why overparametrization is helpful for generalization. This leads to
discovering the unimodality of variance as a function of the level of
parametrization, and to decomposing the variance into that arising from label
noise, initialization, and randomness in the training data to understand the
sources of the error.
  In this work we develop a deeper understanding of this area. Specifically, we
propose using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to decompose the variance in the
test error in a symmetric way, for studying the generalization performance of
certain two-layer linear and non-linear networks. The advantage of the analysis
of variance is that it reveals the effects of initialization, label noise, and
training data more clearly than prior approaches. Moreover, we also study the
monotonicity and unimodality of the variance components. While prior work
studied the unimodality of the overall variance, we study the properties of
each term in variance decomposition.
  One key insight is that in typical settings, the interaction between training
samples and initialization can dominate the variance; surprisingly being larger
than their marginal effect. Also, we characterize ""phase transitions"" where the
variance changes from unimodal to monotone. On a technical level, we leverage
advanced deterministic equivalent techniques for Haar random matrices, that --
to our knowledge -- have not yet been used in the area. We also verify our
results in numerical simulations and on empirical data examples.

Technical Debt Items (TDI) are atomic elements of TD that can be observed in

code-smells, which are just one type of TDIs, are introduced and ""survive""
during release cycles. However, little is known about whether the results on
the survivability of code-smells hold for other types of code TDIs (i.e., bugs

survivability of code TDIs by conducting an empirical study analysing two
industrial cases and 31 open-source systems from Apache Foundation. Method: We
analysed 133,670 code TDIs (35,703 from the industrial systems) detected by
SonarQube (in 193,196 commits) to assess their survivability using
survivability models. Results: In general, code TDIs tend to remain and linger
for long periods in open-source systems, whereas they are removed faster in
industrial systems. Code TDIs that survive over a certain threshold tend to
remain much longer, which confirms previous results. Our results also suggest
that bugs tend to be removed faster, while code smells and vulnerabilities tend
to survive longer.

Assuming that the metric is a warped product of static two-dimensional
Lorentzian spacetime and an $(n-2)$-dimensional Einstein space $K^{n-2}$ with
curvature $k=0, \pm 1$, and that the scalar field depends only on the radial
variable, we present a complete classification of static solutions for both
signs of kinetic term. Contrary to the case with a non-phantom scalar field,
the Fisher solution is not unique, and there exist two additional metrics
corresponding to the generalizations of the Ellis-Gibbons solution and the
Ellis-Bronnikov solution. We explore the maximal extension of these solutions
in detail by the analysis of null/spacelike geodesics and singularity. For the
phantom Fisher and Ellis-Gibbons solutions, we find that there inevitably
appear parallelly propagated (p.p) curvature singularities in the parameter
region where there are no scalar curvature singularities. Interestingly, the
areal radius blows up at these p.p curvature singularities, which are
nevertheless accessible within a finite affine time along the radial null
geodesics. It follows that only the Ellis-Bronnikov solution describes a
regular wormhole in the two-sided asymptotically flat spacetime. Using the
general transformation relating the Einstein and Jordan frames, we also present
a complete classification of solutions with the same symmetry coupled to a
conformal scalar field. Additionally, by solving the field equations in the
Jordan frame, we prove that this classification is genuinely complete.

However, even if the communication with the Cloud back end lasts for some

Hence, an ecosystem of processing nodes can be present at the edge of the

Various challenges should be met before we talk about a fully automated
ecosystem where EC nodes can cooperate or understand the status of them and the
environment to be capable of efficiently serving end users or applications. In

nematic phase, the superconductivity is continuously suppressed and reaches a

early detection of foodborne illness complaints in social media documents such
as Yelp restaurant reviews. Current systems have been successfully applied for
documents in English and, as a result, a promising direction is to increase
coverage and recall by considering documents in additional languages, such as
Spanish or Chinese. Training previous systems for more languages, however,
would be expensive, as it would require the manual annotation of many documents
for each new target language. To address this challenge, we consider
cross-lingual learning and train multilingual classifiers using only the
annotations for English-language reviews. Recent zero-shot approaches based on
pre-trained multi-lingual BERT (mBERT) have been shown to effectively align
languages for aspects such as sentiment. Interestingly, we show that those
approaches are less effective for capturing the nuances of foodborne illness,
our public health application of interest. To improve performance without extra
annotations, we create artificial training documents in the target language
through machine translation and train mBERT jointly for the source (English)
and target language. Furthermore, we show that translating labeled documents to
multiple languages leads to additional performance improvements for some target
languages. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach through extensive
experiments with Yelp restaurant reviews in seven languages. Our classifiers
identify foodborne illness complaints in multilingual reviews from the Yelp
Challenge dataset, which highlights the potential of our general approach for
deployment in health departments.

calculation of the building energy balance. If steady-state heat conduction is
observed, which is commonly used to assess the heat losses in building, there
is an analytical solution for one-dimensional problem. For two and
three-dimensional problems, especially for the complex geometry cases, one must
use numerical methods to solve the heat conduction equation. To standardise two
and three-dimensional calculation of heat losses through building elements, ISO
10211 standard can be used. The standard has four benchmark examples with
criteria that must be satisfied to declare a method as a high-precision
calculation method. A problem occurs for Case 1 of benchmark test because the
analysed problem has a singular point due to discretely assigned Dirichlet
boundary conditions. The reliability of the results around the singular point
could be improved by the refinement of the mesh in the area around the singular
point, but as a point of interest is the total heat flux that is entering the
building element, and it must converge between subdivisions, this method is not
good since the reliable result cannot be reached. The problem for the
convergence is in the marginal node because the temperature gradient in it
increases as the temperature difference remains constant and the distance
between the corresponding nodes decreases. For that reason, Case 1 from the
benchmark is inadequate because even if there is a discontinuity in temperature
field on the boundary, there is an interval in which this change is to happen,
and the heat flux has a theoretical limit which is not infinity. From the
results of this research, it is shown that one should neglect a certain number
of singular points in order to achieve the tolerance given by the standard
since the temperature further from the marginal node is stable for any
subdivision.

involving untrusted parties has given rise to diverse trust issues. In
particular, IP piracy, overproduction, and hardware Trojan attacks pose
significant threats to digital design manufacturers. Watermarking has been one
of the solutions employed by the semiconductor industry to overcome many of the
trust issues. However, current watermarking techniques have low coverage, incur
hardware overheads, and are vulnerable to removal or tampering attacks.
Additionally, these watermarks cannot detect Trojan implantation attacks where
an adversary alters a design for malicious purposes. We address these issues in
our framework called SIGNED: Secure Lightweight Watermarking Scheme for Digital
Designs.
  SIGNED relies on a challenge-response protocol based interrogation scheme for
generating the watermark. SIGNED identifies sensitive regions in the target
netlist and samples them to form a compact signature that is representative of
the functional and structural characteristics of a design. We show that this
signature can be used to simultaneously verify, in a robust manner, the
provenance of a design, as well as any malicious alterations to it at any stage
during design process. We evaluate SIGNED on the ISCAS85 and ITC benchmark
circuits and obtain a detection accuracy of 87.61\% even for modifications as
low as 5-gates. We further demonstrate that SIGNED can benefit from integration
with a logic locking solution, where it can achieve increased protection
against removal/tempering attacks and incurs lower overhead through judicious
reuse of the locking logic for watermark creation.

role in determining the carrier transport properties, thermoelectric

However, for two-dimensional (2D) materials, the widely-used models for carrier
transport only consider the interactions between electrons and some specific
phonon modes, which usually leads to inaccruate predictions of
electrons/phonons transport properties. In this work, comprehensive
investigations on full electron-phonon couplings and their influences on
carrier mobility and thermoelectric performances of 2D group-IV and V elemental
monolayers were performed, and we also analyzed in details the selection rules
on electron-phonon couplings using group-theory arguments. Our calculations
revealed that, for the cases of shallow dopings where only intravalley
scatterings are allowed, the contributions from optical phonon modes are
significantly larger than those from acoustic phonon modes in group-IV
elemental monolayers, and LA and some specific optical phonon modes contribute
significantly to the total intravalley scatterings. When the doping increases
and intervalley scatterings are allowed, the intervalley scatterings are much
stronger than intravalley scatterings, and ZA/TA/LO phonon modes dominate the
intervalley scatterings in monolayer Si, Ge and Sn. The dominant contributions
to the total intervalley scatterings are ZA/TO in monolayer P, ZA/TO in
monolayer As and TO/LO in monolayer Sb. Based on the thorough investigations on
the full electron-phonon couplings, we predict accurately the carrier
mobilities and thermoelectric figure of merits in these two elemental crystals,

functions, including logistic function and quadratic logistic function.
Different types of logistic functions indicate different spatial dynamics. The
fractal dimension curves of urban growth in western countries follows the
common logistic function, while these curves of cities in northern China
follows quadratic logistic function. Now we want to know whether all Chinese
cities follow the same rules of urban evolution. This paper is devoted to
exploring the fractals and fractal dimension properties of the city of Shenzhen
in southern China. The urban region is divided into four subareas, ArcGIS
technology, box-counting method is adopted to extract spatial datasets, and the
least squares regression is employed to estimate fractal parameters. The
results show that: (1) The urban form of Shenzhen city has clear fractal
structure, but fractal dimension values of different subareas are different;
(2) The fractal dimension growth curves of all the four study areas can only be
modeled by the common logistic function, and the goodness of fit increases over
time; (3) The peak of urban growth in Shenzhen had passed before 1986, the
fractal dimension growth is approaching its maximum capacity. Conclusions can
be reached that the urban form of Shenzhen bears characteristics of
multifractals, the fractal structure has been becoming better gradually through
self-organization, but its land resources are reaching the limits of growth.
The fractal dimension curves of Shenzhen's urban growth are similar to those of
European and American cities, but differ from those of the cities in northern
China. This suggests that there is subtle different dynamic mechanisms of city
development between northern and southern China.

constructed from a lattice of floppy, bistable square unit cells. We compare
the domain wall excitations that arise in this metamaterial to their magnetic

system. By tuning the ratios of the internal elements of the unit cell, we
control the curvature and propagation speed of internal domain walls. We change
the domain wall morphology from a binary, strictly spin-like regime, to a more
continuous, elastic regime. In the elastic regime, we inject, manipulate, and
expel domain walls via textured forcing at the boundaries. The system exhibits
dynamical hysteresis, and we find a first-order dynamical transition as a
function of the driving frequency. We demonstrate a forcing protocol that
produces multiple, topologically-distinct steady cycles, which are protected by
the differences in their internal domain wall arrangements. These distinct
steady cycles rapidly proliferate as the complexity of the applied forcing
texture is increased, thus suggesting that such mechanical systems could serve
as useful model systems to study multistability, glassiness, and memory in

context of violent relaxation. Initial conditions are the out-of-equilibrium
disks of self-gravitating particles in rigid rotation. By that mechanism,
robust and non-stationary spiral arms can be formed within a few free-fall
times by the shearing of the mass ejection following the collapse. With a
closer look, we find different properties of the arms in connection with the
initial configuration. The winding degree tends to increase with initial
angular speed provided that a disk is thin. If disk surface is circular, both
number and position of arms are governed by the Poissonian density fluctuations
that produce more arms as more particles are introduced. On the contrary, if
the surface ellipticity is imposed, the number of arms and their placement are
effectively controlled. Otherwise, the increase of thickness leads to a
complicated outcome since the number of arms and winding degree are less
effectively controlled. We speculate that this complexity is caused by a strong
non-axisymmetric field during the violent relaxation that disorganizes the
pre-collapse motion and the concentration of particles.

as well as molecular computer simulations, and thermodynamic modeling were
performed to probe the mechanisms by which guanidinium salts influence the
stability of the collapsed versus uncollapsed state of an elastin-like
polypeptide (ELP), an uncharged thermoresponsive polymer. We found that the
cation's action was highly dependent upon the counteranion with which it was
paired. Specifically, Gnd+ was depleted from the ELP/water interface and was
found to stabilize the collapsed state of the macromolecule when paired with
well-hydrated anions such as sulfate. Stabilization in this case occurred via
an excluded volume (or depletion) effect, whereby sulfate was strongly
partitioned away from the ELP/water interface. Intriguingly, at low salt
concentrations, Gnd+ was also found to stabilize the collapsed state of the ELP
when paired with SCN-, which is a strong binder for the ELP. In this case, the
anion and cation were both found to be enriched in the collapsed state of the
polymer. The collapsed state was favored because the Gnd+ crosslinked the
polymer chains together. Moreover, the anion helped partition Gnd+ to the
polymer surface. At higher salt concentrations (>1.5 M), GndSCN switched to
stabilizing the uncollapsed state because a sufficient amount of Gnd+ and SCN-
partitioned to the polymer surface to prevent cross-linking from occurring.
Finally, in a third case, it was found that salts which interacted in an
intermediate fashion with the polymer (e.g. GndCl) favored the uncollapsed
conformation at all salt concentrations.

These corrections result from both the quantum recoil and the finite size of a

the energy of the incident particle. The peculiarities of transition radiation

large-scale datasets) with various base models. The advanced dropout
outperforms all the referred techniques on all the datasets.We further compare
the effectiveness ratios and find that advanced dropout achieves the highest

characteristics, including convergence of the adaptive dropout rate, the

generation without an explicit distribution. In addition, the ability of
overfitting prevention is evaluated and confirmed. Finally, we extend the

deaths. This outbreak has placed an enormous strain on healthcare systems and
workers. Severe cases require hospital care, and 8.5\% of patients require
mechanical ventilation in an intensive care unit (ICU). One major challenge is
the necessity for clinical care personnel to don and doff cumbersome personal
protective equipment (PPE) in order to enter an ICU unit to make simple
adjustments to ventilator settings. Although future ventilators and other ICU
equipment may be controllable remotely through computer networks, the enormous
installed base of existing ventilators do not have this capability. This paper
reports the development of a simple, low cost telerobotic system that permits

a small Cartesian robot capable of operating a ventilator touch screen with

applied in other domains (e.g., they change the clothes to summer outfits).
Previous works have made efforts to eliminate domain-difference. They typically
assume domain annotations are provided, and all the domains share classes.
However, for authentication, there could be a large number of domains shared by
different identities/classes, and it is impossible to annotate these domains
exhaustively. It could make domain-difference challenging to model and
eliminate. In this paper, we propose a domain-agnostic method that eliminates
domain-difference without domain labels. We alternately perform latent domain
discovery and domain-difference elimination until our model no longer detects
domain-difference. In our approach, the latent domains are discovered by
learning the heterogeneous predictive relationships between inputs and outputs.
Then domain-difference is eliminated in both class-dependent and
class-independent spaces to improve robustness of elimination. We further
extend our method to a meta-learning framework to pursue more thorough
domain-difference elimination. Comprehensive empirical evaluation results are

next-to-leading order in electroweak interaction, the Higgs-decay partial
widths and the cross sections of the main single-Higgs production processes
depend on the Higgs-boson self-coupling via weak loops. Measurements of
$\kappa_\lambda$, i.e. the rescaling of the trilinear Higgs self-coupling, are
presented in this dissertation. Results are obtained exploiting proton-proton
collision data from the Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13
TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector in 2015, 2016 and 2017, corresponding to a
luminosity of up to 79.8 fb$^{-1}$. Constraints on the Higgs self-coupling are

$b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$, $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ and $b\bar{b}b\bar{b}$,
considering single-Higgs (H) production modes, $ggF$, $VBF$, $ZH$, $WH$ and

$b\bar{b}$ decay channels, and combining the aforementioned analyses (H+HH) to
improve the sensitivity on $\kappa_\lambda$. Under the assumption that new

navigating a common workspace to fulfill various intralogistics tasks,
typically formulated as the Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problem. To keep
plan execution deadlock-free, one approach is to construct an Action Dependency
Graph (ADG) which encodes the ordering of AGVs as they proceed along their
routes. Using this method, delayed AGVs occasionally require others to wait for
them at intersections, thereby affecting the plan execution efficiency. If the
workspace is shared by dynamic obstacles such as humans or third party robots,
AGVs can experience large delays. A common mitigation approach is to re-solve
the MAPF using the current, delayed AGV positions. However, solving the MAPF is
time-consuming, making this approach inefficient, especially for large AGV
teams. In this work, we present an online method to repeatedly modify a given
acyclic ADG to minimize route completion times of each AGV. Our approach
persistently maintains an acyclic ADG, necessary for deadlock-free plan
execution. We evaluate the approach by considering simulations with random
disturbances on the execution and show faster route completion times compared
to the baseline ADG-based execution management approach.

evaluation metric. Since it is not differentiable, we usually instead optimize
the learning model with the connectionist temporal classification (CTC)
objective loss, which maximizes the posterior probability over the sequential
alignment. Due to the optimization gap, the predicted sentence with the highest
decoding probability may not be the best choice under the WER metric. To tackle
this issue, we propose a novel architecture with cross modality augmentation.
Specifically, we first augment cross-modal data by simulating the calculation
procedure of WER, i.e., substitution, deletion and insertion on both text label
and its corresponding video. With these real and generated pseudo video-text
pairs, we propose multiple loss terms to minimize the cross modality distance
between the video and ground truth label, and make the network distinguish the
difference between real and pseudo modalities. The proposed framework can be
easily extended to other existing CTC based continuous SLR architectures.
Extensive experiments on two continuous SLR benchmarks, i.e.,
RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather and CSL, validate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

are known to affect particle dynamics at small scales and the associated
turbophoretic drift. Our simulations, however, predicted that electrostatic
forces also dominate the vortical motion of the particles, induced by the
secondary flows of Prandtl's second kind of the carrier fluid. Herein we
treated flows at two frictional Reynolds numbers ($Re_\mathrm{\tau}=$ 300
and~600), two particle-to-gas density ratios ($\rho_\mathrm{p}/\rho=$ 1000 and
7500), and three Coulombic-to-gravitational force ratios
($F_\mathrm{el}/F_\mathrm{g}=$ 0, 0.004, and 0.026). In flows with a high
density ratio at $Re_\mathrm{\tau}=$ 600 and $F_\mathrm{el}/F_\mathrm{g}=$
0.004, the particles tend to accumulate at the walls. On the other hand, at a
lower density ratio, respectively a higher $F_\mathrm{el}/F_\mathrm{g}$ of
0.026, the charged particles still follow the secondary flow structures that
are developed in the duct. However, even in this case, the electrostatic forces
counteract the particles' inward flux from the wall and, as a result, their
vortical motion in these secondary structures is significantly attenuated. This
change in the flow pattern results in an increase of the particle number
density at the bisectors of the walls by a factor of five compared to the
corresponding flow with uncharged particles. Finally, at $Re_\mathrm{\tau}=$
300, $\rho_\mathrm{p}/\rho=$ 1000, and $F_\mathrm{el}/F_\mathrm{g}=$ 0.026 the
electrostatic forces dominate over the aerodynamic forces and gravity and,

perspective provides a principled way to search for global optima in federated

algorithm uses MCMC for approximate inference of local posteriors on the
clients and efficiently communicates their statistics to the server, where the
latter uses them to refine a global estimate of the posterior mode. Finally, we

optimization paradigms is limited by either the agent population size or the
network dimension. As a radical improvement, this paper for the first time
constructs a two-facet scalable decentralized optimization framework. To this
end, we first develop a systemic network dimension reduction technique to
virtually cluster the agents and lower the dimension of network-induced
constraints, then constitute a novel shrunken-primal-multi-dual subgradient
(SPMDS) algorithm based on the reduced-dimension network. Rigorous optimality
and convergence analyses of the proposed decentralized optimization framework
are provided. The SPMDS-based optimization framework is free of agent-to-agent
communication and no additional aggregators are required for agent clusters.
The efficiency and efficacy of the proposed approaches are demonstrated, in
comparison with benchmark methods, through simulations of electric vehicle
charging control problems and traffic congestion control problems.

initial conditions is a significant obstacle in forecasting the weather and
other geophysical fluid flows. Data assimilation is the process whereby the
uncertainty in initial conditions is reduced by the astute combination of model
predictions and real-time data. This chapter reviews recent findings from
investigations on the impact of chaos on data assimilation methods: for the
Kalman filter and smoother in linear systems, analytic results are derived; for
their ensemble-based versions and nonlinear dynamics, numerical results provide
insights. The focus is on characterising the asymptotic statistics of the
Bayesian posterior in terms of the dynamical instabilities, differentiating
between deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We also present two novel
results. Firstly, we study the functioning of the ensemble Kalman filter in the
context of a chaotic, coupled, atmosphere-ocean model with a quasi-degenerate
spectrum of Lyapunov exponents, showing the importance of having sufficient
ensemble members to track all of the near-null modes. Secondly, for the fully
non-Gaussian method of the particle filter, numerical experiments are conducted
to test whether the curse of dimensionality can be mitigated by discarding
observations in the directions of little dynamical growth of uncertainty. The
results refute this option, most likely because the particles already embody
this information on the chaotic system. The results also suggest that it is the
rank of the unstable-neutral subspace of the dynamics, and not that of the
observation operator, that determines the required number of particles. We
finally discuss how knowledge of the random attractor can play a role in the
development of future data assimilation schemes for chaotic multiscale systems
with large scale separation.

making. Recently, it was shown that this difficulty can be resolved by using of
the general QMT based on quantum instruments. In the present paper we analyse
the problem of the combination of QOE, RRE, and the well-known QQ-equality

switching (OCS), without electronic switches and a reduced number of
transceivers due to direct links among servers. One of the promising ways of
implementing OCS is by using tunable lasers and arrayed waveguide grating
routers. Such an OCS-network can offer high bandwidth and low network latency,

and a DRL agent determines which user and how many consecutive RBs for that
user should be scheduled at each RB allocation step. The state space, action

More specifically, the originally quasi-continuous action space, which is
inherent to contiguous FDRA, is refined into a finite and discrete action space
to obtain a trade-off between the inference latency and system performance.
Simulation results show that the proposed DRL-based scheduling algorithm

background as much as possible. Series of alpha and beta decays originated from
radioactive impurities can remain as background in the energy region of
$0\nu\beta\beta$. Because they are sequential decays, we can remove them by
tagging preceding and following events. This tagging method requires minimized
dead-time of DAQ system. A new DAQ system was introduced in CANDLES with new
FADC (Flash Analog-to-Digital Converter) modules using 8 event buffers and
SpaceWire-to-GigabitEthernet network for data readout. To reduce the dead-time,

to a half of previous DAQ's read-time. With reduced read-time accompanied by
multiple event buffers, the new DAQ system is realized with efficiency is very
close to 100$\%$ (no event lost at 20cps, which is CANDLES trigger rate, after
63 hours of data taking). With improved performance, it is expected to achieve
higher background suppression for CANDLES experiment.

Obstacles that must be battled include poor visibility conditions, difficult
navigation, and hard manipulation with devices under water. This chapter
focuses on the problem of localizing a device under water using markers. It
discusses various filters that enhance and improve images recorded under water,
and their impact on marker-based tracking. It presents various combinations of
10 image improving algorithms and 4 marker detecting algorithms, and tests
their performance in real situations. All solutions are designed to run
real-time on mobile devices to provide a solid basis for augmented reality.
Usability of this solution is evaluated on locations in Mediterranean Sea. It
is shown that image improving algorithms with carefully chosen parameters can
reduce the problems with visibility under water and improve the detection of
markers. The best results are obtained with marker detecting algorithms that
are specifically designed for underwater environments.

laws. We introduce a one-hot encoding vector as an additional input vector,
which is used to label the constitutive law we wish to solve. Then we build a
DNN which takes $(\hat{X}, \hat{t})$ as input along with a constitutive law
label and outputs the corresponding solution. It is the first time, to our
knowledge, that we can evaluate multi-constitutive laws through only one
training process while still obtaining good accuracies. We found that MCNN
trained to solve multiple PDEs outperforms individual neural network solvers
trained with PDE in some cases.

  Robotics, 2013. pp. 349-359",,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There has been considerable interest in boosting and bagging, including the
combination of the adaptive techniques of AdaBoost with the random selection
with replacement techniques of Bagging. At the same time there has been a
revisiting of the way we evaluate, with chance-corrected measures like Kappa,
Informedness, Correlation or ROC AUC being advocated. This leads to the
question of whether learning algorithms can do better by optimizing an
appropriate chance corrected measure. Indeed, it is possible for a weak learner
to optimize Accuracy to the detriment of the more reaslistic chance-corrected
measures, and when this happens the booster can give up too early. This
phenomenon is known to occur with conventional Accuracy-based AdaBoost, and the
MultiBoost algorithm has been developed to overcome such problems using restart
techniques based on bagging. This paper thus complements the theoretical work
showing the necessity of using chance-corrected measures for evaluation, with
empirical work showing how use of a chance-corrected measure can improve
boosting. We show that the early surrender problem occurs in MultiBoost too, in
multiclass situations, so that chance-corrected AdaBook and Multibook can beat
standard Multiboost or AdaBoost, and we further identify which chance-corrected
measures to use when.

  Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 2020",,,"cs.LG physics.flu-dyn stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The estimation of model parameters with uncertainties from observed data is a
ubiquitous inverse problem in science and engineering. In this paper, we
suggest an inexpensive and easy to implement parameter estimation technique
that uses a heteroscedastic Bayesian Neural Network trained using anchored
ensembling. The heteroscedastic aleatoric error of the network models the
irreducible uncertainty due to parameter degeneracies in our inverse problem,
while the epistemic uncertainty of the Bayesian model captures uncertainties
which may arise from an input observation's out-of-distribution nature. We use
this tool to perform real-time parameter inference in a 6 parameter G-equation
model of a ducted, premixed flame from observations of acoustically excited
flames. We train our networks on a library of 2.1 million simulated flame
videos. Results on the test dataset of simulated flames show that the network
recovers flame model parameters, with the correlation coefficient between
predicted and true parameters ranging from 0.97 to 0.99, and well-calibrated
uncertainty estimates. The trained neural networks are then used to infer model
parameters from real videos of a premixed Bunsen flame captured using a
high-speed camera in our lab. Re-simulation using inferred parameters shows
excellent agreement between the real and simulated flames. Compared to Ensemble
Kalman Filter-based tools that have been proposed for this problem in the
combustion literature, our neural network ensemble achieves better
data-efficiency and our sub-millisecond inference times represent a savings on
computational costs by several orders of magnitude. This allows us to calibrate
our reduced-order flame model in real-time and predict the thermoacoustic
instability behaviour of the flame more accurately.
