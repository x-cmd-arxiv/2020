the scalar field will be written in terms of some cosmographic parameters. The

also be shown that the free Dirac-Born-Infeld theory cannot account for flat

a notion of essential prime which does not rely on the existence of enough
minimal primes above every element. We will re-prove Simmons' result that

econometric techniques not only for the computational burden connected with the
high volume and speed which data are generated, but even more for the variety
of sources through which data are collected (Arbia, 2021). This paper
concentrates specifically on this last aspect. Common examples of non
traditional Big Data sources are represented by crowdsourcing (data voluntarily
collected by individuals) and web scraping (data extracted from websites and
reshaped in a structured dataset). A common characteristic to these
unconventional data collections is the lack of any precise statistical sample
design, a situation described in statistics as 'convenience sampling'. As it is
well known, in these conditions no probabilistic inference is possible. To
overcome this problem, Arbia et al. (2018) proposed the use of a special form
of post-stratification (termed 'post-sampling'), with which data are
manipulated prior their use in an inferential context. In this paper we
generalize this approach using the same idea to estimate a Spatial Lag Model
(SLM). We start showing through a Monte Carlo study that using data collected
without a proper design, parameters' estimates can be biased. Secondly, we
propose a post sampling strategy to tackle this problem. We show that the
proposed strategy indeed achieves a bias-reduction, but at the price of a
concomitant increase in the variance of the estimators. We thus suggest an
MSE-correction operational strategy. The paper also contains a formal
derivation of the increase in variance implied by the post-sampling procedure
and concludes with an empirical application of the method in the estimation of
a hedonic price model in the city of Milan using web scraped data.

years, revealed the accelerated expansion rate of the Universe, usually assumed
to be driven by the so called dark energy, which, according to recent
estimates, provides now about 70 % of the total amount of matter-energy in the
Universe. The nature of dark energy is yet unknown. Several models of dark
energy have been proposed: a non zero cosmological constant, a potential energy
of some self interacting scalar field, effects related to the non homogeneous
distribution of matter, or effects due to alternative theories of gravity.
Recently, it turned out that the standard flat LambdaCDM is disfavored (at 4
sigma) when confronted with a high redshift Hubble diagram, consisting of
supernovae of type Ia (SNIa), quasars (QSOs) and gamma ray-bursts (GRBs)
([1-3]). Here we use the same data to investigate if this tension is confirmed,
using a different approach: actually in [1-3], the deviation between the best
fit model and the LambdaCDM model was noticed by comparing cosmological
parameters derived from cosmographic expansions of their theoretical
predictions and observed high redshift Hubble diagram. In this paper we use a
substantially different approach, based on a specific parametrization of the
redshift dependent equation of state (EOS) of dark energy component w(z). Our
statistical analysis is aimed to estimate the parameters characterizing the
dark energy EOS: our results indicate (at > 3 sigma level) an evolving dark
energy EOS, while the cosmological constant has a constant EOS, wLambda =-1.
This result not only confirms the tension previously detected, but shows that
it is not an artifact of cosmographic expansions.

when---due to mobility---the number of vehicles in vicinity of each other is
changing dynamically. In a congested scenario, allocation of unique resources
for each vehicle becomes infeasible and a congested resource allocation
strategy has to be developed. The standardized approach in 5G, namely
semi-persistent scheduling (SPS) suffers from effects caused by spatial
distribution of the vehicles. In our approach, we turn this into an advantage.
We propose a novel DIstributed Resource Allocation mechanism using multi-agent
reinforcement Learning (DIRAL) which builds on a unique state representation.
One challenging issue is to cope with the non-stationarity introduced by
concurrently learning agents which causes convergence problems in multi-agent
learning systems. We aimed to tackle non-stationarity with unique state
representation. Specifically, we deploy view-based positional distribution as a

their relation to monadic adjunctions. We begin with a proof of the 2/4
property of spherical adjunctions in the setting of stable $\infty$-categories.
The proof is based on the description of spherical adjunctions as 4-periodic
semiorthogonal decompositions given by Halpern-Leistner, Shipman and by
Dyckerhoff, Kapranov, Schechtman, Soibelman. We then describe a class of
examples of spherical adjunctions arising from local systems on spheres. The
main result of this paper is a characterization of the sphericalness of a
monadic adjunctions in terms of properties of the monad. Namely, a monadic
adjunction is spherical if and only if the twist functor is an equivalence and
commutes with the unit map of the monad. This characterization is inspired by
work of Ed Segal.

challenging problem in many scientific machine learning applications. To
extract global information, one usually needs a large window size, a large
number of layers, and/or a large number of channels. This can often
significantly increase the computational cost. In this work, we present a novel
neural network layer that directly incorporates long-range information for a
point cloud. This layer, dubbed the long-range convolutional (LRC)-layer,
leverages the convolutional theorem coupled with the non-uniform Fourier
transform. In a nutshell, the LRC-layer mollifies the point cloud to an
adequately sized regular grid, computes its Fourier transform, multiplies the
result by a set of trainable Fourier multipliers, computes the inverse Fourier
transform, and finally interpolates the result back to the point cloud. The
resulting global all-to-all convolution operation can be performed in
nearly-linear time asymptotically with respect to the number of input points.
The LRC-layer is a particularly powerful tool when combined with local
convolution as together they offer efficient and seamless treatment of both
short and long range interactions. We showcase this framework by introducing a
neural network architecture that combines LRC-layers with short-range
convolutional layers to accurately learn the energy and force associated with a
$N$-body potential. We also exploit the induced two-level decomposition and
propose an efficient strategy to train the combined architecture with a reduced
number of samples.

and influence in sharping our rich living experiences. However, since IoT
devices are usually resource-constrained, lightweight block ciphers have played
a major role in serving as a building block for secure IoT protocols. In CHES
2015, SIMECK, a family of block ciphers, was designed for resource-constrained
IoT devices. Since its publication, there have been many analyses on its
security. In this paper, under the one bit-flip model, we propose a new
efficient fault analysis attack on SIMECK ciphers. Compared to those previously
reported attacks, our attack can recover the full master key by injecting
faults into only a single round of all SIMECK family members. This property is
crucial, as it is infeasible for an attacker to inject faults into different
rounds of a SIMECK implementation on IoT devices in the real world.
Specifically, our attack is characterized by exercising a deep analysis of
differential trail between the correct and faulty immediate ciphertexts.
Extensive simulation evaluations are conducted, and the results demonstrate the

a method is challenging due to the limited availability of public annotated

Abell clusters (KYDISC) and a set of hydrodynamic simulations (YZiCS), we find
in some cases a hint of mass segregation inside the virial radius. Segregation
is visible more clearly when the massive galaxy fraction is used instead of
mean stellar mass. The trend is more significant in the simulations than in the

for low-mass clusters. We compare the masses of galaxies and their dark haloes
at the time of infall and at the present epoch to quantify the amount of tidal

I consider a population of individuals who possibly play two consecutive rounds
of public goods game, with different enhancement factors. Importantly,
individuals have independent strategies in the two rounds. However, their
strategy in the first round affects the game they play in the second round. I
consider two different scenarios where either only first-round cooperators play
a second public goods game, or both first-round cooperators and first-round
defectors play a second public goods game, but in different groups. The first
scenario can be considered a reward dilemma, and the second can be considered
an assortative public goods game but with independent strategies of the
individuals in the two rounds. Both models show cooperators can survive either
in a fixed point or through different periodic orbits. Interestingly, due to
the emergence of a correlation between the strategies of the individuals in the
two rounds, individuals develop consistent personalities during the evolution.
This, in turn, helps cooperation to flourish. These findings shed new light on

a turbulent wedge that spreads laterally as it proceeds downstream. Historical
literature reports the spreading half angle is approximately 6$^{\circ}$ in
zero-pressure gradient flows regardless of Reynolds number and roughness shape.
Recent simulations and experiments have sought to explain the lateral-spreading
mechanism and have observed high- and low-speed streaks along the flanks of the
wedge that appear central to the spreading process. To better elucidate the
roles of Reynolds number and of streaks, a naphthalene flow-visualization
survey and hotwire measurements are conducted over a wider range of Reynolds
numbers and longer streamwise domain than previous experiments. The naphthalene
results show that, while the mean spreading angle is consistent with the
historical literature, there may be a weak dependency on $x$-based Reynolds
number, which emerges as a result of the large sample size of the survey. The
distance between the roughness element and the wedge origin exhibits a clear
trend with the roughness-height-based Reynolds number. The hotwire measurements
explain that this difference originates from whether breakdown occurs first in
the central lobe or flanking streaks of the turbulent wedge. This observation
highlights different transition dynamics at play within the supercritical
regime. In agreement with past experiments, the hotwire measurements reveal
that breakdown occurs in the wall normal shear layer above low-speed streaks.
Due to the elongated streamwise extent of this experiment, secondary streak
dynamics are also uncovered. A high-speed streak is produced directly
downstream of the initiating low-speed streak. Subsequently, a new low-speed
streak is observed outboard of the previous high-speed streak. This
self-sustaining process is the driving mechanism of turbulent wedge spreading.

atoms at comparable energy and time scales are omnipresent in thermal and
light-driven chemistry at metal surfaces. Excited (hot) electrons can
measurably affect molecule-metal reactions by contributing to state-dependent
reaction probabilities. Vibrational state-to-state scattering of NO on Au(111)
has been one of the most studied examples in this regard, providing a testing
ground for developing various nonadiabatic theories. This system is often cited
as the prime example for the failure of electronic friction theory, a very
efficient model accounting for dissipative forces on metal-adsorbed molecules
due to the creation of hot electrons in the metal. However, the exact failings
compared to experiment and their origin from theory are not established for any
system, because dynamic properties are affected by many compounding simulation
errors of which the quality of nonadiabatic treatment is just one. We use a
high-dimensional machine learning representation of electronic structure theory
to minimize errors that arise from quantum chemistry. This allows us to perform
a comprehensive quantitative analysis of the performance of nonadiabatic
molecular dynamics in describing vibrational state-to-state scattering of NO on
Au(111) and compare directly to adiabatic results. We find that electronic
friction theory accurately predicts elastic and single-quantum energy loss, but
underestimates multi-quantum energy loss and overestimates molecular trapping
at high vibrational excitation. Our analysis reveals that multi-quantum energy
loss can potentially be remedied within friction theory, whereas the
overestimation of trapping constitutes a genuine breakdown of electronic
friction theory. Addressing this overestimation for dynamic processes in
catalysis and surface chemistry will require more sophisticated theories.

graph-structured data. They are widely used in various applications, such as
recommendation, fraud detection, and search. In these domains, the graphs are
typically large, containing hundreds of millions of nodes and several billions
of edges. To tackle this challenge, we develop DistDGL, a system for training
GNNs in a mini-batch fashion on a cluster of machines. DistDGL is based on the
Deep Graph Library (DGL), a popular GNN development framework. DistDGL
distributes the graph and its associated data (initial features and embeddings)
across the machines and uses this distribution to derive a computational
decomposition by following an owner-compute rule. DistDGL follows a synchronous
training approach and allows ego-networks forming the mini-batches to include
non-local nodes. To minimize the overheads associated with distributed
computations, DistDGL uses a high-quality and light-weight min-cut graph
partitioning algorithm along with multiple balancing constraints. This allows
it to reduce communication overheads and statically balance the computations.
It further reduces the communication by replicating halo nodes and by using
sparse embedding updates. The combination of these design choices allows
DistDGL to train high-quality models while achieving high parallel efficiency
and memory scalability. We demonstrate our optimizations on both inductive and
transductive GNN models. Our results show that DistDGL achieves linear speedup
without compromising model accuracy and requires only 13 seconds to complete a
training epoch for a graph with 100 million nodes and 3 billion edges on a
cluster with 16 machines. DistDGL is now publicly available as part of
DGL:https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/python/dgl/distributed.

representative (aggregated) chains. Each {\em superstate} in the representative
chain represents a {\em group of related} states in the original Markov chain.
Typically, the choice of number of superstates in the aggregated chain is
ambiguous, and based on the limited prior know-how. In this paper we present a
structured methodology of determining the best candidate for the number of
superstates. We achieve this by comparing aggregated chains of different sizes.
To facilitate this comparison we develop and quantify a notion of {\em marginal
return}. Our notion captures the decrease in the {\em heterogeneity} within the
group of the {\em related} states (i.e., states represented by the same
superstate) upon a unit increase in the number of superstates in the aggregated
chain. We use Maximum Entropy Principle to justify the notion of marginal
return, as well as our quantification of heterogeneity. Through simulations on
synthetic Markov chains, where the number of superstates are known apriori, we
show that the aggregated chain with the largest marginal return identifies this
number. In case of Markov chains that model real-life scenarios we show that
the aggregated model with the largest marginal return identifies an inherent
structure unique to the scenario being modelled; thus, substantiating on the
efficacy of our proposed methodology.

field is revealed in the optical spin Hall effect (OSHE), where under resonant
excitation of the Dirac points precession of the photon pseudospin around the

the medical imaging domain, as means for deriving diagnostic, prognostic, and
predictive biomarkers, and by contributing to precision medicine. However,
these methods have yet to see widespread clinical adoption, in part due to
limited generalization performance across various imaging devices, acquisition
protocols, and patient populations. In this work, we propose a new paradigm in
which data from a diverse range of acquisition conditions are ""harmonized"" to a
common reference domain, where accurate model learning and prediction can take
place. By learning an unsupervised image to image canonical mapping from
diverse datasets to a reference domain using generative deep learning models,
we aim to reduce confounding data variation while preserving semantic
information, thereby rendering the learning task easier in the reference
domain. We test this approach on two example problems, namely MRI-based brain
age prediction and classification of schizophrenia, leveraging pooled cohorts
of neuroimaging MRI data spanning 9 sites and 9701 subjects. Our results
indicate a substantial improvement in these tasks in out-of-sample data, even
when training is restricted to a single site.

Also, compiling a handcrafted and curated domain-specific knowledge base for

that it teaches models features that are helpful for language understanding.
However, we want pretrained models to learn not only to represent linguistic
features, but also to use those features preferentially during fine-turning.
With this goal in mind, we introduce a new English-language diagnostic set
called MSGS (the Mixed Signals Generalization Set), which consists of 20
ambiguous binary classification tasks that we use to test whether a pretrained
model prefers linguistic or surface generalizations during fine-tuning. We
pretrain RoBERTa models from scratch on quantities of data ranging from 1M to
1B words and compare their performance on MSGS to the publicly available
RoBERTa-base. We find that models can learn to represent linguistic features
with little pretraining data, but require far more data to learn to prefer
linguistic generalizations over surface ones. Eventually, with about 30B words
of pretraining data, RoBERTa-base does demonstrate a linguistic bias with some
regularity. We conclude that while self-supervised pretraining is an effective
way to learn helpful inductive biases, there is likely room to improve the rate
at which models learn which features matter.

has a colloidal phase separating the Wigner Crystal from the high density fluid
phase. Near the crossover between crystal and fluid ground state energies, the
argument is quite general and valid for practically any quantum transition
between a crystal and a more amorphous phase. In this regime, the colloid is a
gel and its ""Goldstone"" modes are flows of irregular fluid droplets separated
by crystalline walls. A metal insulator transition occurs when a single bubble
of fluid spans the entire system. Beyond this transition the colloid is a sol
and its properties depend on the existence of meta-stable finite crystallites
with negative surface tension. If these exist, the sol phase has lower energy
than the homogeneous fluid. In the two dimensional HEF, Kivelson and Spivak
argued that such negative surface tension objects always exist, at least in the
form of stripes. We argue that the existence of stripes also implies the
existence of finite negative tension elliptical crystallites and the detailed
competition between the finite crystallite phase and striped phases is
difficult to calculate. We also provide weaker arguments that finite
crystallites exist in three dimensions. This provides evidence for our claim
that the gapless excitations at non-zero wavenumber, observed in the numerical
calculations of\cite{haule}\cite{gapless} are quantum remnants of these
crystallites (Bosonic quasi-particles) in the limit of vanishing surface
tension. Finally, we suggest a Landau mean field theory for the second order
quantum phase transition between the fluid and sol phases.

observed multivariate systems with hidden variables is a fundamental question
in many scientific domains. Methods extracting causal information from
conditional independencies between variables of a system are common tools for
this purpose, but are limited in the lack of independencies. To surmount this
limitation, we capitalize on the fact that the laws governing the generative
mechanisms of a system often result in substructures embodied in the generative
functional equation of a variable, which act as sufficient statistics for the
influence that other variables have on it. These functional sufficient
statistics constitute intermediate hidden variables providing new conditional
independencies to be tested. We propose to use the Information Bottleneck
method, a technique commonly applied for dimensionality reduction, to find
underlying sufficient sets of statistics. Using these statistics we formulate
new additional rules of causal orientation that provide causal information not
obtainable from standard structure learning algorithms, which exploit only
conditional independencies between observable variables. We validate the use of
sufficient statistics for structure learning both with simulated systems built

concept of representations and Koopman operators. The interplay between the two
leads to the full description of systems that can be represented linearly in a
finite dimension, based on the properties of the Koopman operator spectrum. The
geometry of state space is connected to the notion of representation, both in
the linear case - where it is related to joint level sets of eigenfunctions -
and in the nonlinear representation case. As shown here, even nonlinear
finite-dimensional representations can be learned using the Koopman operator
framework, leading to a new class of representation eigenproblems. The
connection to learning using neural networks is given. An extension of the
Koopman operator theory to ""static"" maps between different spaces is provided.
The effect of the Koopman operator spectrum on Mori-Zwanzig type

systems by a decentralized way is a simple but non-trivial question. In other
words, is it possible to design any local controller without understanding the
other controlled areas and with less understanding of network structure? With
respect to the special properties of physical interaction between the local
areas, this paper suggests two existing theories for tackling this issue.
Firstly, passivity theory is shown to be a candidate for frequency control
problem using swing equation. Based on the passivity of swing dynamics, it is
possible to guarantee the system stability by designing for each local area a
passive controller. We further extend the passivity approach to the
hierarchically decentralized control system with unknown communication delay.
Secondly, we discuss the application of generalized frequency variable (GFV) to
the frequency control problem using area-control-error. Each local controller
is designed such that each local subsystem follows a nominal model set.
Utilizing GFV theory, we present a triad of conditions that sufficiently
guarantee the system stability. The conditions can be tested conveniently by a
limited set of inequalities established from the GFV and the eigenvalues of the
physical interaction matrix. The effectiveness, limitation, and challenge of
two theories are discussed by design examples with numerical simulations.

seeking a local minima on the loss surface within a small region, and leverage

the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm in this context. Although, FW implicitly

develop a novel RNN training method that, surprisingly, even with the
additional cost, the overall training cost is empirically observed to be lower
than back-propagation. Our method leads to a new Frank-Wolfe method, that is in
essence an SGD algorithm with a restart scheme. We prove that under certain
conditions our algorithm has a sublinear convergence rate of $O(1/\epsilon)$
for $\epsilon$ error. We then conduct empirical experiments on several
benchmark datasets including those that exhibit long-term dependencies, and
show significant performance improvement. We also experiment with deep RNN
architectures and show efficient training performance. Finally, we demonstrate
that our training method is robust to noisy data.

and properties of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). It is also a candidate key
parameter in improving the utility of SNe Ia for cosmological distance
determinations. Here we study the velocity distribution of a sample of 311 SNe
Ia from the kaepora database. The velocities are derived from the Si II
$\lambda$6355 absorption line in optical spectra measured at (or extrapolated
to) the time of peak brightness. We statistically show that the observed
velocity has a bimodal Gaussian distribution consisting of two groups of SNe
Ia: Group I with a lower but narrower scatter ($\mu_1 = 11000 \text{km
s}^{-1}$, $\sigma_1 = 700 \text{km s}^{-1}$), and Group II with a higher but
broader scatter ($\mu_2 = 12300 \text{km s}^{-1}$, $\sigma_2 = 1800 \text{km
s}^{-1}$). The population ratio of Group I to Group II is 201:110 (65%:35%).
There is substantial degeneracy between the two groups, but for SNe Ia with
velocity $v > 12000 \text{km s}^{-1}$, the distribution is dominated by Group
II. The true origin of the two components is unknown, though there could be
that naturally there exist two intrinsic velocity distributions as observed.
However, we try to use asymmetric geometric models through statistical
simulations to reproduce the observed distribution assuming all SNe Ia share
the same intrinsic distribution. In the two cases we consider, 35\% of SNe Ia
are considered to be asymmetric in Case 1, and all SNe Ia are asymmetric in
Case 2. Simulations for both cases can reproduce the observed velocity
distribution but require a significantly large portion ($>35\%$) of SNe Ia to
be asymmetric. In addition, the Case 1 result is consistent with recent
polarization observations that SNe Ia with higher Si II $\lambda$6355 velocity
tend to be more polarized.

learning on graph data, which can capture structural patterns on a graph via
specifically designed convolution and readout operations. In many graph
classification applications, GCN-based approaches have outperformed traditional
methods. However, most of the existing GCNs are inefficient to preserve local
information of graphs -- a limitation that is especially problematic for graph
classification. In this work, we propose a locality-preserving dense GCN with
graph context-aware node representations. Specifically, our proposed model
incorporates a local node feature reconstruction module to preserve initial
node features into node representations, which is realized via a simple but
effective encoder-decoder mechanism. To capture local structural patterns in
neighbourhoods representing different ranges of locality, dense connectivity is
introduced to connect each convolutional layer and its corresponding readout
with all previous convolutional layers. To enhance node representativeness, the
output of each convolutional layer is concatenated with the output of the
previous layer's readout to form a global context-aware node representation. In
addition, a self-attention module is introduced to aggregate layer-wise
representations to form the final representation. Experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over
state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy.

  and Online Routing",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology is providing urban
transportation managers tremendous opportunities for better operation of urban
mobility systems. However, there are significant challenges in real-time
implementation, as the computational time of the corresponding operations
optimization model increases exponentially with increasing vehicle numbers.
Following the companion paper (Chen et al., 2020) which proposes a novel
automated traffic control scheme for isolated intersections, this study
proposes a network-level real-time traffic control framework for CAVs on grid
networks. The proposed framework integrates a rhythmic control (RC) method with
an online routing algorithm to realize collisionfree control of all CAVs on a
network and achieve superior performance in average vehicle delay, network
traffic throughput, and computational scalability. Specifically, we construct a
preset network rhythm that all CAVs can follow to move on the network and avoid
collisions at all intersections. Based on the network rhythm, we then formulate
online routing for the CAVs as a mixed integer linear program, which optimizes
the entry times of CAVs at all entrances of the network and their time-space
routings in real time. We provide a sufficient condition that the linear
programming relaxation of the online routing model yields an optimal integer
solution. Extensive numerical tests are conducted to show the performance of
the proposed operations management framework under various scenarios. It is
illustrated that the framework is capable of achieving negligible delays and
increased network throughput. Furthermore, the computational time results are
also promising. The CPU time for solving a collision-free control optimization
problem with 2,000 vehicles is only 0.3 s on an ordinary personal computer.

IllustrisTNG suite of cosmological simulations to study the conditions under
which these asymmetries may arise in current theoretical galaxy formation
models. We find that more than 50% of the sample has at least a 10% difference
in integrated flux between the high- and low-velocity half of the spectrum,
thus the typical TNG100 galaxy has an HI profile that is not fully symmetric.
We find that satellite galaxies are a more asymmetric population than centrals,
consistent with observational results. Using halo mass as a proxy for
environment, this trend appears to be driven by the satellite population within
the virial radius of haloes more massive than $10^{13} M_{\odot}$, typical of
medium/large groups. We show that, while the excess of HI asymmetry in group
satellites is likely driven by ram pressure, the bulk of the asymmetric HI
profiles observed in TNG100 are driven by physical processes able to affect
both the central and satellite populations. Our results highlight how
asymmetries are not driven solely by environment, and multiple physical
processes can produce the same asymmetric shape in global HI spectra.

existence of axions in nature has not been confirmed. Interestingly, axions
arise as pseudoscalar fields derived from the Chern-Simons theory in condensed

dynamical induced by spin-wave excitations and exhibits rich exotic phenomena,

study of the dynamical axion field is rare due to the lack of real materials.
Recently, MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ was discovered to be an antiferromagnetic topological

strategy to new domains. On the other hand, deep neural networks (DNNs)
generally need large amounts of data and computational resources for training.
However, this requirement is not met in many settings. To address these
challenges, we propose the TUTOR DNN synthesis framework. TUTOR targets tabular
datasets. It synthesizes accurate DNN models with limited available data and
reduced memory/computational requirements. It consists of three sequential
steps. The first step involves generation, verification, and labeling of
synthetic data. The synthetic data generation module targets both the
categorical and continuous features. TUTOR generates the synthetic data from
the same probability distribution as the real data. It then verifies the
integrity of the generated synthetic data using a semantic integrity classifier
module. It labels the synthetic data based on a set of rules extracted from the
real dataset. Next, TUTOR uses two training schemes that combine synthetic and
training data to learn the parameters of the DNN model. These two schemes focus
on two different ways in which synthetic data can be used to derive a prior on
the model parameters and, hence, provide a better DNN initialization for
training with real data. In the third step, TUTOR employs a grow-and-prune
synthesis paradigm to learn both the weights and the architecture of the DNN to
reduce model size while ensuring its accuracy. We evaluate the performance of
TUTOR on nine datasets of various sizes. We show that in comparison to fully
connected DNNs, TUTOR, on an average, reduces the need for data by 5.9x,
improves accuracy by 3.4%, and reduces the number of parameters (fFLOPs) by
4.7x (4.3x). Thus, TUTOR enables a less data-hungry, more accurate, and more
compact DNN synthesis.

with special emphasis on the most task-relevant regions and, at the same time,
encodes low informative regions to provide high discriminability. The
Top-DB-Net is composed of three streams: (i) a global stream encodes rich image
information from a backbone, (ii) the Top DropBlock stream encourages the
backbone to encode low informative regions with high discriminative features,
and (iii) a regularization stream helps to deal with the noise created by the
dropping process of the second stream, when testing the first two streams are
used. Vast experiments on three challenging datasets show the capabilities of
our approach against state-of-the-art methods. Qualitative results demonstrate
that our method exhibits better activation maps focusing on reliable parts of
the input images.

address such sudden flow breakdowns. When queuing is imminent, Speed
Harmonization (SH), which adjusts speeds in upstream traffic to mitigate
traffic showckwaves downstream, can be applied. However, because SH depends on
driver awareness and compliance, it may not always be effective in mitigating
congestion. The use of multiagent reinforcement learning for collaborative
learning, is a promising solution to this challenge. By incorporating this
technique in the control algorithms of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV),
it may be possible to train the CAVs to make joint decisions that can mitigate
highway bottleneck congestion without human driver compliance to altered speed
limits. In this regard, we present an RL-based multi-agent CAV control model to
operate in mixed traffic (both CAVs and human-driven vehicles (HDVs)). The
results suggest that even at CAV percent share of corridor traffic as low as
10%, CAVs can significantly mitigate bottlenecks in highway traffic. Another
objective was to assess the efficacy of the RL-based controller vis-\`a-vis
that of the rule-based controller. In addressing this objective, we duly
recognize that one of the main challenges of RL-based CAV controllers is the
variety and complexity of inputs that exist in the real world, such as the
information provided to the CAV by other connected entities and sensed
information. These translate as dynamic length inputs which are difficult to
process and learn from. For this reason, we propose the use of Graphical
Convolution Networks (GCN), a specific RL technique, to preserve information
network topology and corresponding dynamic length inputs. We then use this,
combined with Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), to carry out
multi-agent training for congestion mitigation using the CAV controllers.

is the transition era which will be characterized by mixed traffic (where CAVs

expectations that CAVs will improve road safety, on-road CAVs may adopt rather
conservative control policies, and this will likely cause HDVs to unduly
exploit CAV conservativeness by driving in ways that imperil safety. A context
of this situation is lane-changing by the CAV. Without cooperation from other
vehicles in the traffic stream, it can be extremely unsafe for the CAV to
change lanes under dense, high-speed traffic conditions. The cooperation of
neighboring vehicles is indispensable. To address this issue, this paper
develops a control framework where connected HDVs and CAV can cooperate to
facilitate safe and efficient lane changing by the CAV. Throughout the
lane-change process, the safety of not only the CAV but also of all neighboring
vehicles, is ensured through a collision avoidance mechanism in the control
framework. The overall traffic flow efficiency is analyzed in terms of the

change is a major source of traffic disturbance at multi-lane highways that

operations of CAVs and human driven vehicles in the same roadway space (also

traffic problems particularly those that are either caused or exacerbated by
the heterogeneous nature of human driving. In efforts to realize such specific
benefits of CAVs in mixed-stream traffic, it is essential to understand and
simulate the behavior of human drivers in such environments, and microscopic
traffic flow (MTF) models can be used to carry out this task. By helping to
comprehend the fundamental dynamics of traffic flow, MTF models serve as a
powerful approach to assess the impacts of such flow in terms of safety,
stability, and efficiency. In this paper, we seek to calibrate MTF models based
on empirical trajectory data as basis of not only understanding traffic
dynamics such as traffic instabilities, but ultimately using CAVs to mitigate
stop-and-go wave propagation. The paper therefore duly considers the
heterogeneity and uncertainty associated with human driving behavior in order
to calibrate the dynamics of each HDV. Also, the paper designs the CAV
controllers based on the microscopic HDV models that are calibrated in real
time. The data for the calibration is from the Next Generation SIMulation

efficacy of the designed controller to significantly improve not only the
stability of the mixed traffic stream but also the safety of both CAVs and HDVs

selected by matching audio and visual object category distributions, where the

text-based natural language sentences. Sign videos consist of continuous
sequences of sign gestures with no clear boundaries in between. Existing SLT
models usually represent sign visual features in a frame-wise manner so as to
avoid needing to explicitly segmenting the videos into isolated signs. However,
these methods neglect the temporal information of signs and lead to substantial
ambiguity in translation. In this paper, we explore the temporal semantic
structures of signvideos to learn more discriminative features. To this end, we
first present a novel sign video segment representation which takes into
account multiple temporal granularities, thus alleviating the need for accurate
video segmentation. Taking advantage of the proposed segment representation, we
develop a novel hierarchical sign video feature learning method via a temporal
semantic pyramid network, called TSPNet. Specifically, TSPNet introduces an
inter-scale attention to evaluate and enhance local semantic consistency of
sign segments and an intra-scale attention to resolve semantic ambiguity by
using non-local video context. Experiments show that our TSPNet outperforms the

A commonly used
loss function for classification is the cross entropy loss, which is a simple

Based on this loss, many other loss functions have been proposed,~\emph{e.g.},
by adding intra-class and inter-class constraints to enhance the discriminative
ability of the learned features. However, these loss functions fail to consider
the connections between the feature distribution and the model structure.
Aiming at addressing this problem, we propose a channel correlation loss
(CC-Loss) that is able to constrain the specific relations between classes and
channels as well as maintain the intra-class and the inter-class separability.
CC-Loss uses a channel attention module to generate channel attention of
features for each sample in the training stage. Next, an Euclidean distance
matrix is calculated to make the channel attention vectors associated with the
same class become identical and to increase the difference between different
classes. Finally, we obtain a feature embedding with good intra-class

different backbone models trained with the proposed CC-Loss outperform the

This is particularly true for sender authentication in wireless communications

terrestrial wireless devices while, to the best of our knowledge, none of the
previous work took into consideration satellite transmitters. The satellite
scenario is generally challenging because, among others, satellite radio
transducers feature non-standard electronics (usually aged and specifically
designed for harsh conditions). Moreover, the fingerprinting task is
specifically difficult for Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites (like the ones we
focus in this paper) since they orbit at about 800Km from the Earth, at a speed
of around 25,000Km/h, thus making the receiver experiencing a down-link with
unique attenuation and fading characteristics. In this paper, we propose
PAST-AI, a methodology tailored to authenticate LEO satellites through
fingerprinting of their IQ samples, using advanced AI solutions. Our
methodology is tested on real data -- more than 100M I/Q samples -- collected
from an extensive measurements campaign on the IRIDIUM LEO satellites
constellation, lasting 589 hours. Results are striking: we prove that
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and autoencoders (if properly calibrated)

accuracy spanning between 0.8 and 1, depending on prior assumptions. The

KTiOPO$_4$ or LiNbO$_3$, semiconductor integrated sources of photon pairs may
operate at pump wavelengths much closer to the bandgap of the materials. This
is also the case for Bragg-reflection waveguides (BRW) targeting parametric
down-conversion (PDC) to the telecom C-band. The large nonlinear coefficient of
the AlGaAs alloy and the strong confinement of the light enable extremely
bright integrated photon pair sources. However, under certain circumstances, a
significant amount of detrimental broadband photoluminescence has been observed
in BRWs. We show that this is mainly a result of linear absorption near the
core and subsequent radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs at deep
impurity levels in the semiconductor. For PDC with BRWs, we conclude that
devices operating near the long wavelength end of the S-band or the short
C-band require temporal filtering shorter than 1 ns. We predict that shifting
the operating wavelengths to the L-band and making small adjustments in the
material composition will reduce the amount of photoluminescence to negligible
values. Such measures enable us to increase the average pump power and/or the
repetition rate, which makes integrated photon pair sources with on-chip
multi-gigahertz pair rates feasible.

type checking. A well-typed program is \emph{communication safe}, \emph{motion
compatible}, and \emph{collision free}. Our type system provides a

  We have implemented our model on top of the ROS framework. This allows us to

alpha-blend a portion of the RGB training images with faked images, where each

appear in real imagery. This forces the network to rely more strongly on shape
cues. We call this data augmentation technique ``Painting-by-Numbers''. We

various network backbones, MobileNet-V2, ResNets, and Xception, and evaluate it

corruptions and 5 different network backbones, we are in 74% better than
training with clean data. For cases where we are worse than a model trained
without our training schema, it is mostly only marginally worse. However, for
some image corruptions such as images with noise, we see a considerable

noise is automatically compensated by the two-way structure. However, there are
certain possible loopholes in the typical plug-and-play designs, which require
consideration and strict monitoring. This study proposes a loophole-free
plug-and-play QKD scheme with two-way protocol and presents an experimental
demonstration of said scheme. The security is analysed under a collective
attack scenario assisted by the decoy state method. The scheme was implemented
in a 50.4 km commercial fibre without active feedback. The system showed highly
robust performance with an ultra-low error rate and maintained an ultra-high
visibility of 0.9947+/-0.0002 through significant environmental changes over 24
hours.

following up subjects longitudinally, thus generating time to event data. The

correlation between subjects based on the distance between them. Estimates are
obtained through a stochastic approximation version of the Expectation
Maximization algorithm combined with a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain, for which
convergence is proven. The novelty of this model is that spatial correlation is
introduced for survival data at the subject level, each subject having its own
frailty. This univariate spatially correlated frailty model is used to analyze
spatially dependent malaria data, and its results are compared with other

constraints are typically considered crucial for mitigating such pathology.
However, real-world image prior are often hard to simulate with precise
mathematical models, which inevitably limits the performance and generalization
ability of existing prior-regularized restoration methods. In this paper, we
study the problem of face restoration under a more practical ``dual blind''
setting, i.e., without prior assumptions or hand-crafted regularization terms
on the degradation profile or image contents.
  To this end, a novel implicit subspace prior learning (ISPL) framework is
proposed as a generic solution to dual-blind face restoration, with two key
elements: 1) an implicit formulation to circumvent the ill-defined restoration
mapping and 2) a subspace prior decomposition and fusion mechanism to
dynamically handle inputs at varying degradation levels with consistent
high-quality restoration results.
  Experimental results demonstrate significant perception-distortion
improvement of ISPL against existing state-of-the-art methods for a variety of
restoration subtasks, including a 3.69db PSNR and 45.8% FID gain against
ESRGAN, the 2018 NTIRE SR challenge winner. Overall, we prove that it is
possible to capture and utilize prior knowledge without explicitly formulating
it, which will help inspire new research paradigms towards low-level vision

harbour a rich morphological complexity of gaseous structures on different
length scales. A large part of these density structures are thought to be
brought about by the interaction of the stellar wind with a close companion.
The S-type asymptotic giant branch star Pi1 Gruis, which has a known companion
at ~440 au and is thought to harbour a second, closer-by (<10 au) companion,
was observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array as part of
the ATOMIUM Large programme. In this work, the brightest CO, SiO, and HCN
molecular line transitions are analysed. The continuum map shows two maxima,
separated by 0.04'' (6 au). The CO data unambiguously reveal that Pi1 Gru's
circumstellar environment harbours an inclined, radially outflowing, equatorial
density enhancement. It contains a spiral structure at an angle of 38+/-3 deg
with the line-of-sight. The HCN emission in the inner wind reveals a clockwise
spiral, with a dynamical crossing time of the spiral arms consistent with a
companion at a distance of 0.04'' from the asymptotic giant branch star, which
is in agreement with the position of the secondary continuum peak. The inner
wind dynamics imply a large acceleration region, consistent with a beta-law
power of ~6. The CO emission suggests that the spiral is approximately
Archimedean within 5'', beyond which this trend breaks down as the succession
of the spiral arms becomes less periodic. The SiO emission at scales smaller
than 0.5'' exhibits signatures of gas in rotation, which is found to fit the
expected behaviour of gas in the wind-companion interaction zone. An
investigation of SiO maser emission reveals what could be a stream of gas
accelerating from the surface of the AGB star to the companion. Using these
dynamics, we have tentatively derived an upper limit on the companion mass to
be ~1.1 Msol.

8-1000$\mu$m) infrared and radio (rest 1.4~GHz) luminosity in star-forming
galaxies (q$_{IR}$), often referred to as the ""infrared-radio correlation""
(IRRC), to calibrate radio emission as a star formation rate (SFR) indicator.
Previous studies constrained the evolution of q$_{IR}$ with redshift, finding a
mild but significant decline, that is yet to be understood. For the first time,
we calibrate q$_{IR}$ as a function of \textit{both} stellar mass (M$_{\star}$)
and redshift, starting from an M$_{\star}$-selected sample of $>$400,000
star-forming galaxies in the COSMOS field, identified via (NUV-r)/(r-J)
colours, at redshifts 0.1$<$z$<$4.5. Within each (M$_{\star}$,z) bin, we stack
the deepest available infrared/sub-mm and radio images. We fit the stacked IR
spectral energy distributions with typical star-forming galaxy and IR-AGN
templates, and carefully remove radio AGN candidates via a recursive approach.
We find that the IRRC evolves primarily with M$_{\star}$, with more massive
galaxies displaying systematically lower q$_{IR}$. A secondary, weaker
dependence on redshift is also observed. The best-fit analytical expression is
the following:
q$_{IR}$(M$_{\star}$,z)=(2.646$\pm$0.024)$\times$(1+z)$^{(-0.023\pm0.008)}$-(0.148$\pm$0.013)$\times$($\log~M_{\star}$/M$_{\odot}$-10).
The lower IR/radio ratios seen in more massive galaxies are well described by
their higher observed SFR surface densities. Our findings highlight that using
radio-synchrotron emission as a proxy for SFR requires novel
M$_{\star}$-dependent recipes, that will enable us to convert detections from
future ultra deep radio surveys into accurate SFR measurements down to low-SFR,
low-M$_{\star}$ galaxies.

model's behavior allows us to identify training examples most responsible for a
given prediction and, therefore, to faithfully explain the output of a
black-box model. The most generally applicable existing method is based on
influence functions, which scale poorly for larger sample sizes and models.
  We propose gradient rollback, a general approach for influence estimation,
applicable to neural models where each parameter update step during gradient
descent touches a smaller number of parameters, even if the overall number of
parameters is large. Neural matrix factorization models trained with gradient
descent are part of this model class. These models are popular and have found a
wide range of applications in industry. Especially knowledge graph embedding
methods, which belong to this class, are used extensively. We show that
gradient rollback is highly efficient at both training and test time. Moreover,
we show theoretically that the difference between gradient rollback's influence
approximation and the true influence on a model's behavior is smaller than
known bounds on the stability of stochastic gradient descent. This establishes
that gradient rollback is robustly estimating example influence. We also
conduct experiments which show that gradient rollback provides faithful

improve the classification performance with few labeled data and then reduce
the cost in data annotating. Specifically, unsupervised semantic aggregation
based on Triplet Mutual Information (T-MI) loss is explored to generate
semantic labels for unlabeled data. Then the semantic labels are aligned to the
actual class by the supervision of labeled data. Furthermore, a feature pool
that stores the labeled samples is dynamically updated to assign proxy labels
for unlabeled data, which are used as targets for cross-entropy minimization.
Extensive experiments and analysis across four standard semi-supervised

as expected in post-core collapsed clusters subject to as strong a Galactic
tidal field as NGC 6397. There is strong evidence for a central dark component
of 0.8 to 2% of the total mass of the cluster. However, we find robust evidence
disfavoring a central IMBH in NGC 6397, preferring instead a diffuse dark inner
subcluster of unresolved objects with a total mass of 1000 to 2000 solar
masses, half of which is concentrated within 6 arcsec (2% of the stellar
effective radius). These results require the combination of HST and Gaia data:
HST for the inner diagnostics and Gaia for the outer surface density and
velocity anisotropy profiles. The small effective radius of the diffuse dark
component suggests that it is composed of compact stars (white dwarfs and
neutron stars) and stellar-mass black holes, whose inner locations are caused
by dynamical friction given their high progenitor masses. We show that
stellar-mass black holes should dominate the mass of this diffuse dark

dataset: light curves (from FUV to FIR), interferometric squared visibility,
closure phase, triple product measurements, spectral-energy distribution (SED),
high-resolution spectroscopy, differential visibility amplitude, and also
differential phase. In particular, we use spectra from Ondrejov 2m telescope
from 2013 to 2015, to measure the emission in Halpha, HeI, SiII, NeI, or CII
lines, and differential interferometry by CHARA/VEGA from the 2013 campaign to
measure wavelength-dependent sizes across Halpha and HeI 6678. This allows us
to constrain not only optically thick objects (primary, secondary, accretion
disk), but also optically thin objects (disk atmosphere, jets, shell). We
extended our modelling tool Pyshellspec (based on Shellspec; a 1D LTE radiative
transfer code) to include all new observables, to compute differential
visibilities/phases, to perform a Doppler tomography, and to determine a joint
chi^2 metric. After an optimisation of 38 free parameters, we derive a robust
model of the beta Lyr A system. According to the model, the emission is formed
in an extended atmosphere of the disk, two perpendicular jets expanding at ~700
km s^-1, and a symmetric shell with the radius ~70 R_S. The spectroscopy
indicates a low abundance of carbon, 10^-2 of the solar value. We also quantify
systematic differences between datasets and discuss alternative models, with
higher resolution, additional asymmetries, or He-rich abundance.

hard task to determine the physical origin and the extent of the memory effects
based on the underlying microscopic equations of motion. Therefore we propose
to relate the extent of the memory kernel to quantities that are experimentally
observed such as the induction time and the duration of the phase
transformation process. Using a simple kinematic model, we show that the extent
of the memory kernel is positively correlated with the duration of the
transition and of the same order of magnitude, while the distribution of
induction times does not have an effect. This observation is tested at the
example of several model systems, for which we have run Molecular Dynamics

used in conjunction with TTS samples, to encourage code-switched predictions.
We report significant improvements in ASR performance achieving absolute word

adiabatic gauge potential can be used to realize identical dynamics to

introduce an algebraic expression of adiabatic gauge potential. Then, we find
that the explicit form of adiabatic gauge potential can be easily determined by
some algebraic calculations. We demonstrate this method by using a single-spin
system, a two-spin system, and the transverse Ising chain. Moreover, we derive
a lower bound for fidelity to adiabatic time evolution based on the quantum
speed limit. This bound enables us to know the worst case performance of
approximate adiabatic gauge potential. We can also use this bound to find
dominant terms in adiabatic gauge potential to suppress nonadiabatic
transitions. We apply this bound to magnetization reversal of the two-spin
system and to quantum annealing of the transverse Ising chain. Adiabatic gauge
potential reflects structure of energy eigenstates, and thus we also discuss

for $\alpha=0$ in the dyadic setting. We use that for $\alpha>0$ the fractional
maximal function does not use certain small balls. For $\alpha=0$ the proof

reflectance synthesis procedure that significantly improves the

selection procedure is first employed to select a few high-quality frames for
reconstruction. Then a differentiable renderer based 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)
fitting algorithm is applied to recover facial geometries from multiview RGB-D
data, which takes advantages of a powerful 3DMM basis constructed with
extensive data generation and perturbation. Our 3DMM has much larger expressive

geometry using merely linear basis. For reflectance synthesis, we present a
hybrid approach that combines parametric fitting and CNNs to synthesize
high-resolution albedo/normal maps with realistic hair/pore/wrinkle details.
Results show that our system can produce faithful 3D digital human faces with

possible, yet contains less redundant and noisy structure. This problem setting
is closely related to the well-known information bottleneck (IB) principle,
which, however, has less been studied for the irregular graph data and graph
neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, we propose a framework of Graph
Information Bottleneck (GIB) for the subgraph recognition problem in deep graph
learning. Under this framework, one can recognize the maximally informative yet
compressive subgraph, named IB-subgraph. However, the GIB objective is
notoriously hard to optimize, mostly due to the intractability of the mutual
information of irregular graph data and the unstable optimization process. In
order to tackle these challenges, we propose: i) a GIB objective based-on a
mutual information estimator for the irregular graph data; ii) a bi-level
optimization scheme to maximize the GIB objective; iii) a connectivity loss to
stabilize the optimization process. We evaluate the properties of the
IB-subgraph in three application scenarios: improvement of graph
classification, graph interpretation and graph denoising. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the information-theoretic IB-subgraph enjoys superior graph
properties.

antiparticles at LHC energies. The thermodynamic variables are determined in
the framework of the Tsallis distribution. The chemical potentials in the

the Tsallis distribution in high-energy collisions. In particular we find that
the temperature $T$ and the volume $V$ at each beam energy are the same for all

susceptibility chi(T) demonstrates very unusual behavior. It isdescribed by the

low magnetic fields. At high magnetic fields, however, the character of chi(T)

meta attributes from context and infuse them with the context utterances for
better attention over domain-specific key terms and relevance. We study the use

produced by our model carry higher relevance due to the presence of
domain-specific key attributes that exhibit better overlap with the attributes
of the context. Our analysis shows that the performance improvement is mostly
due to the infusion of key terms along with dialogues which result in better

before flares can be used to constrain stellar properties, the flaring-age-mass

Drawing from the complete K2 archive, we searched 3435 $\sim 80$ day long light

packages K2SC to remove instrumental and astrophysical variability from K2
light curves, and AltaiPony to search and characterize the flare candidates. We
confirmed a total of 3844 flares on high probability open cluster members with
ages from zero age main sequence (Pleiades) to 3.6 Gyr (M67). We extended the
mass range probed in the first study of this series to span from Sun-like stars
to mid-M dwarfs. We added the Hyades (690 Myr) to the sample as a comparison
cluster to Praesepe (750 Myr), the 2.6 Gyr old Ruprecht 147, and several
hundred light curves from the late K2 Campaigns in the remaining clusters. The
flare energy distribution was similar in the entire parameter space, following
a power law relation with exponent $\alpha\approx 1.84-2.39$. The flaring rates
declined with age, and declined faster for higher mass stars. We found evidence
that a rapid decline in flaring activity occurred in M1-M2 dwarfs around
Hyades/Praesepe age, when these stars spun down to rotation periods of about 10
days, while higher mass stars had already transitioned to lower flaring rates,
and lower mass stars still resided in the saturated activity regime. (abridged)

systems can host planets in stable orbits. Given the high binary fraction among
stars, the contribution of binary systems to Galactic habitability should be
quantified. Therefore, we have designed a suite of Monte Carlo experiments
aimed at generating large (up to $10^6$) samples of binary systems. For each
system randomly extracted we calculate the intersection between the radiative
habitable zones and the regions of dynamical stability using published
empirical formulations that account for the dynamical and radiative parameters
of both stars of the system. We also consider constraints on planetary
formation in binary systems. We find that the habitability properties of
circumstellar and circumbinary regions are quite different and complementary
with respect to the binary system parameters. Circumbinary HZs are, generally,
rare ($\simeq 4\%$) in the global population of binary systems, even if they
are common for stellar separations $\lesssim 0.2$ AU. Conversely, circumstellar
HZs are frequent ($\ge 80\%$) in the global population, but are rare for
stellar separations $\lesssim 1$ AU. These results are robust against
variations of poorly constrained binary systems parameters. We derive ranges of
stellar separations and stellar masses for which HZs in binary systems can be
wider than the HZs around single stars; the widening can be particularly strong
(up to one order of magnitude) for circumstellar regions around M-type
secondary stars. The comparison of our statistical predictions with
observational surveys shows the impact of selection effects on the habitability

analyzed. In most of the relations, the impact of the crust equation of state

the relation between the tidal deformability and the radius depends on the

  Namely, we suppose that infected vertices may self-quarantine and trace their
infector with a given success probability.
  A traced infector is, in turn, less likely to infect others. We show that the
effectiveness of such tracing process strongly depends on the network
structure. In contrast to previous findings, the tracing
  procedure is not necessarily more effective on networks with heterogeneous
degrees. We also show that network clustering influences the effectiveness of
the tracing process in a non-trivial way: depending on the infectiousness
parameter, contact tracing on clustered networks may either be more, or less
efficient than on network without clustering.

the density power divergence (DPD) family, which measures the discrepancy
between two probability density functions, has been successfully used to build
robust estimators with high stability associated with minimal loss in
efficiency. Here, we develop the minimum DPD estimator (MDPDE) for independent

optimality is in the sense of choosing the strongest downweighting that is
necessary for the particular data set. We conduct a simulation study comparing

find that the spin-valley polarized state shows a two-peak feature which is
different from the other three states. In order to distinguish the other three
states, we calculate the nonlinear Hall response which is proportional to Berry
curvature dipole, and we find the chemical potential dependence of the Berry
curvature dipole can distinguish these three states. Our result can be tested
in the spectroscopy and transport experiments and may be helpful to determine

skeletons for action recognition. Previous methods, which usually learn feature
presentations from a single reconstruction task, may come across the
overfitting problem, and the features are not generalizable for action
recognition. Instead, we propose to integrate multiple tasks to learn more
general representations in a self-supervised manner. To realize this goal, we
integrate motion prediction, jigsaw puzzle recognition, and contrastive
learning to learn skeleton features from different aspects. Skeleton dynamics
can be modeled through motion prediction by predicting the future sequence. And
temporal patterns, which are critical for action recognition, are learned
through solving jigsaw puzzles. We further regularize the feature space by
contrastive learning. Besides, we explore different training strategies to
utilize the knowledge from self-supervised tasks for action recognition. We
evaluate our multi-task self-supervised learning approach with action
classifiers trained under different configurations, including unsupervised,
semi-supervised and fully-supervised settings. Our experiments on the NW-UCLA,
NTU RGB+D, and PKUMMD datasets show remarkable performance for action

forsake a loan such that the overall credit loss is minimised. This is
predicated by forecasting the future cash flows of a loan portfolio up to the
contractual term, as a remedy to the inherent right-censoring of real-world
`incomplete' portfolios. Two techniques, a simple probabilistic model as well
as an eight-state Markov chain, are used to forecast these cash flows
independently. We train both techniques from different segments within
residential mortgage data, provided by a large South African bank, as part of a

implied timing is empirically illustrated as a multi-period optimisation
problem across uncertain cash flows and competing costs. Using a delinquency
measure as a central criterion, our procedure helps to find a loss-optimal
threshold at which loan recovery should ideally occur for a given portfolio.
Furthermore, both the portfolio's historical risk profile and forecasting
thereof are shown to influence the timing of the recovery decision. This work
can therefore facilitate the revision of relevant bank policies or strategies

not yet fully understood. There is now an increasing number of successful
examples of reproducing explosions in the first-principles simulations, which
have shown a slow increase of explosion energy. However, it was recently
pointed out that the growth rates of the explosion energy of these simulations
are insufficient to produce enough $^{56}$Ni mass to account for observations.
We refer to this issue as the `nickel mass problem' (Ni problem, hereafter) in
this paper. The neutrino-driven wind is suggested as one of the most promising
candidates for the solution to the Ni problem in previous literature, but a
multi-dimensional simulation for this is computationally too expensive to allow
long-term investigations. In this paper, we first built a consistent model of
the neutrino-driven wind with an accretion flow onto a protoneutron star (PNS),
by connecting a steady-state solution of the neutrino-driven wind and a
phenomenological mass accretion model. Comparing the results of our model with
the results of first-principles simulations, we find that the total ejectable
amount of the neutrino-driven wind is roughly determined within $\sim$ 1 sec
from the onset of the explosion and the supplementable amount at a late phase
($t_e \gtrsim 1$ sec) remains $M_\mathrm{ej} \lesssim 0.01M_\odot$ at most. Our
conclusion is that it is difficult to solve the Ni problem, by continuous
injection of $^{56}$Ni by the neutrino-driven wind. We suggest that the total
amount of synthesized $^{56}$Ni can be estimated robustly if simulations are
followed up to $\sim 2$ seconds.

environmental effects and quantum coherence in achieving maximal efficiency.
Due to the complexity of biochemical systems and their environments, effective
open quantum system models capable of providing physical insights on the
presence and role of quantum effects are highly needed. In this paper, we
introduce a new approach that combines an effective quantum microscopic
description with a classical stochastic one. Our stochastic collision model
describes both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics without relying on the weak
coupling assumption. We investigate the consequences of spatial and temporal
heterogeneity of noise on transport efficiency in a fully connected graph and
in the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex. Our approach shows how to meaningfully
formulate questions, and provide answers, on important open issues such as the
properties of optimal noise and the emergence of the network structure as a
result of an evolutionary process.

associations between two sets of variables. The canonically correlated
representations, termed \textit{canonical variates} are widely used in
unsupervised learning to analyze unlabeled multi-modal registered datasets.
Despite their success, CCA models may break (or overfit) if the number of
variables in either of the modalities exceeds the number of samples. Moreover,
often a significant fraction of the variables measures modality-specific
information, and thus removing them is beneficial for identifying the
\textit{canonically correlated variates}. Here, we propose $\ell_0$-CCA, a
method for learning correlated representations based on sparse subsets of
variables from two observed modalities. Sparsity is obtained by multiplying the
input variables by stochastic gates, whose parameters are learned together with
the CCA weights via an $\ell_0$-regularized correlation loss. We further
propose $\ell_0$-Deep CCA for solving the problem of non-linear sparse CCA by
modeling the correlated representations using deep nets. We demonstrate the
efficacy of the method using several synthetic and real examples. Most notably,
by gating nuisance input variables, our approach improves the extracted

velocity of the inhomogenous front is below the characteristic KZ velocity
$\hat v \propto \hat\xi/\hat t$. Ising-like models with long-range interactions
can have no sonic horizon, spreading information instantaneously across the

the dynamics adiabatic regardless of the front velocity. However, we show that
we get an adiabatic transition with no defects only when the inhomogeneous

between variability and AGN physical quantities; (ii) extending our knowledge
of the variability features of MEXSAS2 from the X-ray to the optical. We use
the structure function (SF) to analyse AGN flux variations. We model the SF as
a power-law, $\text{SF}(\tau)=A\,(\tau/\tau_0)^\gamma$, and we compute its
variability parameters. We introduce the V-correction as a simple tool to
correctly quantify the amount of variability in the rest frame of each source.
We find a significant decrease of variability amplitude with increasing
bolometric, optical and X-ray luminosity. We obtain the indication of an
intrinsically weak positive correlation between variability amplitude and
redshift, $z$. Variability amplitude is also positively correlated with
$\alpha_\text{ox}$. The slope of the SF, $\gamma$, is weakly correlated with
the bolometric luminosity $L_\text{bol}$ and/or with the black hole mass
$M_\text{BH}$. When comparing optical to X-ray variability properties, we find
that X-ray variability amplitude is approximately the same for those AGNs with
larger or smaller variability amplitude in the optical. On the contrary, AGNs
with steeper SF in the optical do present steeper SF in the X-ray, and vice

worse generalization performance than SGD despite their faster training speed.
This work aims to provide understandings on this generalization gap by
analyzing their local convergence behaviors. Specifically, we observe the heavy
tails of gradient noise in these algorithms. This motivates us to analyze these
algorithms through their Levy-driven stochastic differential equations (SDEs)
because of the similar convergence behaviors of an algorithm and its SDE. Then
we establish the escaping time of these SDEs from a local basin. The result
shows that (1) the escaping time of both SGD and ADAM~depends on the Radon
measure of the basin positively and the heaviness of gradient noise negatively;
(2) for the same basin, SGD enjoys smaller escaping time than ADAM, mainly
because (a) the geometry adaptation in ADAM~via adaptively scaling each
gradient coordinate well diminishes the anisotropic structure in gradient noise
and results in larger Radon measure of a basin; (b) the exponential gradient
average in ADAM~smooths its gradient and leads to lighter gradient noise tails
than SGD. So SGD is more locally unstable than ADAM~at sharp minima defined as
the minima whose local basins have small Radon measure, and can better escape
from them to flatter ones with larger Radon measure. As flat minima here which
often refer to the minima at flat or asymmetric basins/valleys often generalize
better than sharp ones , our result explains the better generalization
performance of SGD over ADAM. Finally, experimental results confirm our
heavy-tailed gradient noise assumption and theoretical affirmation.

Experiments on the benchmark Evidence Integration dataset show that the

overall theoretical context which lies in the argument that the increasing
complexity of the world has made it more difficult for International Relations
(IR) to succeed both in theory and practice. The era of information and the
events of the 21st century have moved IR theory and practice away from real
policy making (Walt, 2016) and have made it entrenched in opinions and
political theories difficult to prove. At the same time, the rise of the
""Fourth Paradigm - Data Intensive Scientific Discovery"" (Hey et al., 2009) and
the strengthening of data science offer an alternative: ""Computational
International Relations"" (Unver, 2018). The use of traditional and contemporary
data-centered tools can help to update the field of IR by making it more
relevant to reality (Koutsoupias, Mikelis, 2020). The ""wedding"" between Data
Science and IR is no panacea though. Changes are required both in perceptions
and practices. Above all, for Data Science to enter IR, the relevant data must
exist. This is where the second component comes into play. I mine the CIA World
Factbook which provides cross-domain data covering all countries of the world.
Then, I execute various data preprocessing tasks peaking in simple machine
learning which imputes missing values providing with a more complete dataset.
Lastly, the third component presents various projects making use of the
produced dataset in order to illustrate the relevance of Data Science to IR
through practical examples. Then, ideas regarding the future development of
this project are discussed in order to optimize it and ensure continuity.
Overall, I hope to contribute to the ""fourth paradigm"" discussion in IR by
providing practical examples while providing at the same time the fuel for
future research.

discontinuous shift in the exact $N$-centered ensemble xc potential, thereby
extending to charged excitations an exact property of uncharged excitations. We
show that applying the Levy-Zahariev 'shift-in-potential' procedure in this

degree $\Omega(r\sqrt{\log r})$ contains a $K_r$ minor. In particular, any

partial result towards Hadwiger's famous conjecture. In this paper, we
investigate analogues of these results in the directed setting. There are
several ways to define a minor in a digraph. One natural way is as follows. A
strong $\overrightarrow{K}_r$ minor is a digraph whose vertex set is
partitioned into $r$ parts such that each part induces a strongly-connected
subdigraph, and there is at least one edge in each direction between any two
distinct parts. We investigate bounds on the dichromatic number and minimum
out-degree of a digraph that force the existence of strong

tournament with dichromatic number at least $2r$ contains a strong
$\overrightarrow{K}_r$ minor, and any tournament with minimum out-degree
$\Omega(r\sqrt{\log r})$ also contains a strong $\overrightarrow{K}_r$ minor.
The latter result is tight up to the implied constant, and may be viewed as a
strong-minor analogue to the classical result of Kostochka and Thomason.

classification (MTSC) has recently received considerable attention. Existing
deep learning-based MTSC techniques, which mostly rely on convolutional or

of single time series. As a result, they struggle to express pairwise
dependencies among multivariate variables directly. Furthermore, current
spatial-temporal modeling (e.g., graph classification) methodologies based on
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are inherently flat and cannot aggregate hub data
in a hierarchical manner. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
graph pooling-based framework MTPool to obtain the expressive global
representation of MTS. We first convert MTS slices to graphs by utilizing
interactions of variables via graph structure learning module and attain the
spatial-temporal graph node features via temporal convolutional module. To get
global graph-level representation, we design an ""encoder-decoder"" based
variational graph pooling module for creating adaptive centroids for cluster
assignments. Then we combine GNNs and our proposed variational graph pooling
layers for joint graph representation learning and graph coarsening, after
which the graph is progressively coarsened to one node. At last, a
differentiable classifier takes this coarsened representation to get the final
predicted class. Experiments on ten benchmark datasets exhibit MTPool
outperforms state-of-the-art strategies in the MTSC task.

linear stability analysis includes line-scattering from the stellar radiation,
and accounts for both radial and non-radial perturbations. We establish a
bridging law for arbitrary perturbation wavelength after which we analyse
separately the long- and short-wavelength limits. While long-wavelength
radiative and magnetic waves are found to be completely decoupled, a key result
is that short-wavelength, radially propagating Alfv\'en waves couple to the
scattered radiation field and are strongly damped due to the line-drag effect.
This damping of magnetic waves in a scattering-line-driven flow could have
important effects on regulating the non-linear wind dynamics, and so might also
have strong influence on observational diagnostics of the wind structure and
clumping of magnetic line-driven winds.

fitness. Fitness is assigned to individuals according to their mito-nuclear

accuracy of mtDNA barcode for species identification. Remarkably, we find that
species identification by mtDNA is equally accurate in the presence or absence

from population geographical isolation during speciation. Nevertheless,
selection imposed by mito-nuclear compatibility influences the diversification
process and leaves signatures in the genetic content and spatial distribution
of the populations, in three ways: phylogenetic trees are more balanced; clades
correlate strongly with the spatial distribution and; there is a substantial
increase in the intraspecies mtDNA similarity. We compare the evolutionary
patterns observed in our model to empirical data from copepods (\textit{T.

offices, and homes worldwide. Although commodity IoT devices are employed by
ordinary end-users, complex environments such as smart buildings, smart
offices, conference rooms, or hospitality require customized and highly
reliable solutions. Those systems called Enterprise Internet of Things (EIoT)
connect such environments to the Internet and are professionally managed
solutions usually offered by dedicated vendors. As EIoT systems require
specialized training, software, and equipment to deploy, this has led to very
little research investigating the security of EIoT systems and their
components. In effect, EIoT systems in smart settings such as smart buildings
present an unprecedented and unexplored threat vector for an attacker. In this
work, we explore EIoT system vulnerabilities and insecure development
practices. Specifically, focus on the usage of drivers as an attack mechanism,
and introduce PoisonIvy, a number of novel attacks that demonstrate an attacker
can easily compromise EIoT system controllers using malicious drivers.
Specifically, we show how drivers used to integrate third-party devices to EIoT
systems can be misused in a systematic fashion. To demonstrate the capabilities
of attackers, we implement and evaluate PoisonIvy using a testbed of real EIoT
devices. We show that an attacker can perform DoS attacks, gain remote control,
and maliciously abuse system resources of EIoT systems. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to analyze the (in)securities of EIoT
deployment practices and demonstrate the associated vulnerabilities in this
ecosystem. With this work, we raise awareness on the (in)secure development
practices used for EIoT systems, the consequences of which can largely impact
the security, privacy, reliability, and performance of millions of EIoT systems

accuracies of $2\times 10^{-15}$ in the computation of $w(z)$ throughout the

upper complex half-plane where $w(z)$ is non-zero. Numerical tests suggest that
this new method is competitive, in accuracy and computation times, with
existing methods for computing $w(z)$ for complex $z$.

control and coordination sought after generally depend on a few fundamental
control primitives. Chief among these primitives is consensus, where agents are
to converge to a common estimate within the range of initial values, which
becomes average consensus when the joint limit should be the average of the
initial values. To provide reliable services that are easy to deploy, these
primitives should operate even when the network is subject to frequent and
unpredictable changes. Moreover, they should mobilize few computational
resources so that low powered, deterministic, and anonymous agents can partake
in the network. In this stringent adversarial context, we investigate the
distributed implementation of these primitives over networks with
bidirectional, but potentially short-lived, communication links. Inspired by
the classic EqualNeighbor and Metropolis agreement rules for multi-agent
systems, we design distributed algorithms for consensus and average consensus,
which we show to operate in polynomial time in a synchronous temporal model.
These algorithms are fully distributed, requiring neither symmetry-breaking
devices such as unique identifiers, nor global control or knowledge of the

layers (CTLs) play a critical role in both efficiency and stability of
halide-perovskite photovoltaics. One of the major concerns is that surface
defects of perovskite could cause detrimental nonradiative recombination and
material degradation. In this work, we addressed this challenging problem by
inserting ultrathin alkali-fluoride (AF) films between the tri-cation
lead-iodide perovskite layer and both CTLs. This bilateral inorganic walls
strategy makes use of both physical-blocking and chemical-anchoring
functionalities of the continuous, uniform and compact AF framework: on the one
hand, the uniformly distributed alkali-iodine coordination at the perovskite-AF
interfaces effectively suppresses the formation of iodine-vacancy defects at
the surfaces and grain boundaries of the whole perovskite film, thus reducing
the trap-assisted recombination at the perovskite-CTL interfaces and therewith
the open-voltage loss; on the other hand, the impermeable AF buffer layers
effectively prevent the bidirectional ion migration at the perovskite-CTLs
interfaces even under harsh working conditions. As a result, a power-conversion
efficiency (PCE) of 22.02% (certified efficiency 20.4%) with low open-voltage
deficit (< 0.4V) was achieved for the low-temperature processed inverted planar
perovskite solar cells. Exceptional operational stability (500 h, ISOS-L-2) and
thermal stability (1000 h, ISOS-D-2) were obtained. Meanwhile, a 35.7% PCE was
obtained under dim-light source (1000 lux white LED light) with the optimized
device, which is among the best records in perovskite indoor photovoltaics.

outcome truncation, where study outcomes are only defined in a subset of
participants. Examples include birthweight (measurable only in the subgroup of
participants who give birth) and miscarriage (which can only occur in
participants who become pregnant). These are typically analysed by making a
comparison between treatment arms within the subgroup (comparing birthweights
in the subgroup who gave birth, or miscarriages in the subgroup who became
pregnant). However, this approach does not represent a randomised comparison
when treatment influences the probability of being observed (i.e. survival).
The practical implications of this for reproductive trials are unclear. We
developed a simulation platform to investigate the implications of outcome
truncation for reproductive medicine trials. We used this to perform a
simulation study, in which we considered the bias, Type 1 error, coverage, and
precision of standard statistical analyses for truncated continuous and binary
outcomes. Increasing treatment effect on the intermediate variable, strength of
confounding between the intermediate and outcome variables, and interactions
between treatment and confounder were found to adversely affect performance.
However, within parameter ranges we would consider to be more realistic, the
adverse effects were generally not drastic. For binary outcomes, the study
highlighted that outcome truncation may lead to none of the participants in a
study arm experiencing the outcome event. This was found to have severe
consequences for inferences, and this may have implications for meta-analysis.

With the growing interest in self-employed vehicles, the issue of MS may be so
important that it undermines their benefits in terms of increased productivity;
not addressing such issue may limit the users' acceptance reducing the safety
and environmental impact of autonomous vehicles. The present study presents a
novel approach to combine minimal travel time with minimal Motion Sickness
Incidence (MSI) by optimising the speed profile for a given path. Through
simulation, a simple vehicle model is used to compare several strategies
evaluating which of them are effective and which not. The optimisation task is
formulated as a Non-linear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and a series of
optimisation routines are computed along the path; the strategies are
implemented within the cost function of the NMPC problem evaluating their
performance and if using a numerical MS model is mandatory to get a significant
reduction of the MSI. The results show that not all the cost functions are
effective, but it is possible to reduce MS without modelling its dynamics;
however, the strategy taking into account the current MSI using a MS model
outperforms the other cost functions in term of efficacy and efficiency. Such a
quantitative approach can be used during motion planning in autonomous
vehicles, to suggest an optimal speed in human-driven vehicles and to improve
the comfort for bus-line services or even trains.

distribution in the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and the weight factor
distribution in the RG procedure, an optimal real-space RG transformation can
be learned without prior knowledge of the physical system. This neural Monte
Carlo RG algorithm allows for direct computation of the RG flow and critical

the waiting time ($T_{\rm wt}$) in between, are roughly comparable to each

the precursors and SGRBs, and find that the spectra of precursor emission can

find that the luminosity and spectral shape may be explained by the the shock
breakout or the photospheric radiation of a fireball launched after the merger
for thermal precursors, or magnetospheric interaction between two NSs prior to
the merger for non-thermal precursors. For the fireball photospheric model, a
matter-dominated jet is preferred and a constraint on the fireball Lorentz
factor can be placed as $\Gamma\sim30$. For the magnetospheric interaction
model, jet launching mechanism may be constrained. In particular, those events
with $T_{\rm wt}/T_{\rm GRB}\gg1$ (e.g. GRB191221802) require the formation of
a supramassive or stable neutron star after the merger, with the delay time

literature by differences in biological make-up and gender discrimination in
the allocation of household resources. Studies estimating the effects of these
factors have generally assumed that offspring sex ratio is random, which is
implausible in view of recent evidence that the sex of a child is partly
determined by prenatal environmental factors. These factors may also affect
child health and survival in utero or after birth, which implies that
conventional approaches to explaining sex differences in mortality are likely
to yield biased estimates. We propose a methodology for decomposing these
differences into the effects of prenatal environment, child biology, and
parental preferences. Using a large sample of twins, we compare mortality rates
in male-female twin pairs in India, a region known for discriminating against
daughters, and sub-Saharan Africa, a region where sons and daughters are
thought to be valued by their parents about equally. We find that: (1) prenatal
environment positively affects the mortality of male children; (2) biological
make-up of the latter contributes to their excess mortality, but its effect has
been previously overestimated; and (3) parental discrimination against female
children in India negatively affects their survival; but failure to control for
the effects of prenatal and biological factors leads conventional approaches to
underestimating its effect by 237 percent during infancy, and 44 percent during

has been applied in real-world industry for tasks like image synthesis,
super-resolution, and colorization. However, traditional I2I translation
methods train data in two or more domains together. This requires lots of
computation resources. Moreover, the results are of lower quality, and they
contain many more artifacts. The training process could be unstable when the
data in different domains are not balanced, and modal collapse is more likely
to happen. We proposed a new I2I translation method that generates a new model
in the target domain via a series of model transformations on a pre-trained
StyleGAN2 model in the source domain. After that, we proposed an inversion
method to achieve the conversion between an image and its latent vector. By
feeding the latent vector into the generated model, we can perform I2I
translation between the source domain and target domain. Both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations were conducted to prove that the proposed method can
achieve outstanding performance in terms of image quality, diversity and
semantic similarity to the input and reference images compared to
state-of-the-art works.

masses of neutral pions at finite temperature and magnetic field by utilizing
the random phase approximation (RPA) approach in the framework of the
two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. And two equivalent formalisms in
the presence of a magnetic field, i.e. the Landau level representation (LLR)
and the proper-time representation (PTR), are applied to obtain the
corresponding analytical expressions of the polarization functions (except the
expressions for the pole masses in the PTR). In order to evaluate the
applicable region of the low-momentum expansion (LME), we compare the numerical
results within the full RPA (FRPA) with those within the reduced RPA (RRPA),
i.e. the RPA in the LME. It is confirmed that the pole masses of {\pi}0in the
FRPA suffer a sudden mass jump at the Mott transition temperature when in the
presence of external magnetic field, and the Mott transition temperature is
catalyzed by the magnetic field. And by analyzing the behaviors of the
directional sound velocities of {\pi}0, which are associated with the breaking
of the Lorentz invariance by the heat bath and the magnetic field, we clarify
the two problems existing in previous literatures: one is that the transverse
sound velocities in the medium are always larger than unity and thus violate
the law of causality on account of the non-covariant regularization scheme, the
other is that the longitudinal sound velocities are identically equal unity at
finite temperature on account of the limitation of the derivative expansion
method used.

will be constructed for the shock and acoustic wave computation on unstructured

unstructured triangular cell, which may involve the closest neighbors of
neighboring cells. The compactness and high-order accuracy of the scheme are
coming from the consistency between the high-order initial reconstruction and
the high-order gas evolution model under GKS framework. The high-order
evolution solution at a cell interface provides not only a time-accurate flux
function, but also the time-evolving flow variables. Therefore, the
cell-averaged flow variables and their gradients can be explicitly updated at
the next time level from the moments of the same time-dependent gas
distribution function. Based on the cell averages and cell-averaged
derivatives, both linear and nonlinear high-order reconstruction can be
obtained for macroscopic flow variables in the evaluation of local equilibrium
and non-equilibrium states. The current nonlinear reconstruction is a
combination of WENO and ENO methodology. The initial piecewise discontinuous
reconstruction is used for the determination non-equilibrium state and an
evolved smooth reconstruction for the equilibrium state. The evolution model in
gas-kinetic scheme is based on a relaxation process from non-equilibrium to
equilibrium state. The accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the scheme have
been validated. The main conclusion of the paper is that beyond the first-order
Riemann solver, the use of high-order gas evolution model seems necessary in
the development of high-order schemes.

Morphological and structural characterizations demonstrate that the obtained

AutoML-nirvana. Our method starts from a complete graph mapped to a neural

of interactions: selecting, connecting, elaborating, exploring, and sharing. We
evaluated MediSyn with 14 participants by allowing them to freely explore the

four models trained on the same dataset: an n-gram baseline, an LSTM, and two

vertex weight as the number of people at the site. An edge capacity limits the
number of people that can enter the edge per unit time. In the dynamic flow
network, given particular points on edges or vertices, called sinks, all the
people evacuate from the vertices to the sinks as quickly as possible. The
problem is to find the location of sinks on a dynamic flow path network in such
a way that the aggregate evacuation time (i.e., the sum of evacuation times for
all the people) to sinks is minimized. We consider two models of the problem:
the confluent flow model and the non-confluent flow model. In the former model,
the way of evacuation is restricted so that all the people at a vertex have to
evacuate to the same sink, and in the latter model, there is no such
restriction. In this paper, for both the models, we develop algorithms which
run in almost linear time regardless of the number of sinks. It should be

languages? 2) Is lexical knowledge stored in few parameters, or is it scattered
throughout the network? 3) How do these representations fare against
traditional static word vectors in lexical tasks? 4) Does the lexical
information emerging from independently trained monolingual LMs display latent
similarities? Our main results indicate patterns and best practices that hold
universally, but also point to prominent variations across languages and tasks.
Moreover, we validate the claim that lower Transformer layers carry more
type-level lexical knowledge, but also show that this knowledge is distributed
across multiple layers.

undersampling bias of the initiator-FCIQMC. The method allows faster
convergence with the number of walkers to the FCI limit than the normal
initiator method, particularly for large systems. In its application to
strongly correlated molecules, however, the method is prone to overshooting the
FCI energy at intermediate walker numbers, with convergence to the FCI limit
from below. In this paper, we present a solution to the overshooting problem in
strongly correlated molecules, as well as further accelerating convergence to
the FCI energy. This is achieved by offsetting the reference energy to a value
typically below the Hartree-Fock energy but above the exact energy. This
offsetting procedure does not change the exactness property of the algorithm,
namely convergence to the exact FCI solution in the large-walker limit, but at
its optimal value greatly accelerates convergence. There is no overhead cost
associated with this offsetting procedure, and is therefore a pure and
substantial computational gain. We illustrate the behavior of this offset
adaptive shift method by applying it to the N$_2$ molecule, the ozone molecule
at three different geometries (equilibrium open minimum, a hypothetical ring
minimum, and a transition state) in three basis sets (cc-pV$X$Z, $X$=D,T,Q),
and the chromium dimer in cc-pVDZ basis set, correlating 28 electrons in 76
orbitals. We show that in most cases the offset adaptive shift method converges
much faster than both the normal initiator method and the original adaptive

skewed, researchers may choose to report the whole or part of the five-number

maximum values) rather than the sample mean and standard deviation. In the
recent literature, it is often suggested to transform the five-number summary
back to the sample mean and standard deviation, which can be subsequently used
in a meta-analysis. However, if a study contains skewed data, this
transformation and hence the conclusions from the meta-analysis are unreliable.
Therefore, we introduce a novel method for detecting the skewness of data using
only the five-number summary and the sample size, and meanwhile propose a new
flow chart to handle the skewed studies in a different manner. We further show
by simulations that our skewness tests are able to control the type I error
rates and provide good statistical power, followed by a simulated meta-analysis
and a real data example that illustrate the usefulness of our new method in

set of analysis routines. The comet fully disintegrated during its perihelion
passage. Prior to that, a broadening and an increase of the intensity peak with
decreasing heliocentric distance was accompanied by a drop to zero polarisation
at high phase angles (~105-135{\deg}, STEREO-B) and the emergence of negative
polarisation at low phase angles (~25-35{\deg}, STEREO-A). Outside the
near-comet region, the tail exhibited a steep slope of increasing polarisation
with increasing cometocentric distance, with the slope becoming less prominent
as the comet approached the Sun. The steep slope may be attributed to
sublimation of refractory organic matrix and the processing of dust grains, or
to presence of amorphous carbon. The change in slope with proximity to the Sun
is likely caused by the gradual sublimation of all refractory material. The
polarisation signatures observed at both sets of phase angles closer to the
comet photocentre as the comet approached the Sun are best explained by
fragmentation of the nucleus, exposing fresh Mg-rich silicate particles,
followed by their gradual sublimation. The need for further studies of such
comets, both observational and theoretical, is highlighted, as well as the
benefit of the analysis routines created for this work.

univariate polynomials over the split quaternions, provided such a
factorization exists. Failure of the algorithm is equivalent to
non-factorizability for which we present also geometric interpretations in
terms of rulings on the quadric of non-invertible split quaternions. However,
suitable real polynomial multiples of split quaternion polynomials can still be
factorized and we describe how to find these real polynomials. Split quaternion
polynomials describe rational motions in the hyperbolic plane. Factorization
with linear factors corresponds to the decomposition of the rational motion
into hyperbolic rotations. Since multiplication with a real polynomial does not
change the motion, this decomposition is always possible. Some of our ideas can
be transferred to the factorization theory of motion polynomials. These are
polynomials over the dual quaternions with real norm polynomial and they
describe rational motions in Euclidean kinematics. We transfer techniques
developed for split quaternions to compute new factorizations of certain dual
quaternion polynomials.

Google Brain's team, the Capsule Networks (CapsNets) have improved the
generalization ability, as compared to DNNs, due to their multi-dimensional
capsules and preserving the spatial relationship between different objects.
However, they pose significantly high computational and memory requirements,
making their energy-efficient inference a challenging task. This paper
provides, for the first time, an in-depth analysis to highlight the design and
management related challenges for the (on-chip) memories deployed in hardware
accelerators executing fast CapsNets inference. To enable an efficient design,
we propose an application-specific memory hierarchy, which minimizes the
off-chip memory accesses, while efficiently feeding the data to the hardware
accelerator. We analyze the corresponding on-chip memory requirements and
leverage it to propose a novel methodology to explore different scratchpad
memory designs and their energy/area trade-offs.
  Afterwards, an application-specific power-gating technique is proposed to
further reduce the energy consumption, depending upon the utilization across
different operations of the CapsNets. Our results for a selected Pareto-optimal
solution demonstrate no performance loss and an energy reduction of 79% for the
complete accelerator, including computational units and memories, when compared
to a state-of-the-art design executing Google's CapsNet model for the MNIST

out-of-distribution generalization which assumes that some aspects of the data
distribution vary across the training set but that the underlying causal
mechanisms remain constant. Recently, Arjovsky et al. (2019) proposed Invariant
Risk Minimization (IRM), an objective based on this idea for learning deep,
invariant features of data which are a complex function of latent variables;
many alternatives have subsequently been suggested. However, formal guarantees
for all of these works are severely lacking. In this paper, we present the
first analysis of classification under the IRM objective--as well as these
recently proposed alternatives--under a fairly natural and general model. In
the linear case, we show simple conditions under which the optimal solution
succeeds or, more often, fails to recover the optimal invariant predictor. We
furthermore present the very first results in the non-linear regime: we
demonstrate that IRM can fail catastrophically unless the test data are
sufficiently similar to the training distribution--this is precisely the issue
that it was intended to solve. Thus, in this setting we find that IRM and its
alternatives fundamentally do not improve over standard Empirical Risk
Minimization.

as autonomous driving and service robot. This paper studies the problem of
scene flow estimation from two consecutive 3D point clouds. In this paper, a
novel hierarchical neural network with double attention is proposed for
learning the correlation of point features in adjacent frames and refining
scene flow from coarse to fine layer by layer. The proposed network has a new
more-for-less hierarchical architecture. The more-for-less means that the
number of input points is greater than the number of output points for scene
flow estimation, which brings more input information and balances the precision
and resource consumption. In this hierarchical architecture, scene flow of
different levels is generated and supervised respectively. A novel attentive
embedding module is introduced to aggregate the features of adjacent points
using a double attention method in a patch-to-patch manner. The proper layers
for flow embedding and flow supervision are carefully considered in our network
designment. Experiments show that the proposed network outperforms the
state-of-the-art performance of 3D scene flow estimation on the FlyingThings3D

realistic LiDAR odometry task, which is an key problem in autonomous driving.
The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed network can outperform the

schedule consisting of a long base load injection and two closely separated
short injections near top dead center. Previous studies of close-coupled double
injections under constant ambient conditions showed an increased penetration
rate of the subsequent fuel spray. However, the aerodynamic gain from the
preceding injection is counteracted by the density rise during the compression
stroke under transient engine conditions. The study confirms that the rate of
mixing of the subsequent fuel spray is significantly increased. Regarding
combustion behavior, the thermodynamic analysis exhibits contributions of low
temperature oxidation reactions of more than 20 % to the total heat release,
with a notable amount of unburnt fuel mass varying from 25 to 61 %. The
analysis of the optical data reveals the multi-dimensional impact of changes in
operating parameters on the local mixture field and ignition dynamics. The
onset of low temperature reactivity of the first short injection is found to be
dominated by the operating strategy, while the location is strongly related to
the local mixing state. Low temperature ignition of the consecutive fuel spray
is significantly promoted, when upstream low temperature reactivity of the
preceding injection is sustained. Likewise, it is shown that high temperature
ignition is accelerated by the entrainment of persistent upstream low

identification of nonlinear dynamics that bounds the model error in terms of
the prediction horizon and the magnitude of the derivatives of the system
states. Using higher-order derivatives of general nonlinear dynamics that need
not be known, we construct a Koopman operator-based linear representation and
utilize Taylor series accuracy analysis to derive an error bound. The resulting
error formula is used to choose the order of derivatives in the basis functions
and obtain a data-driven Koopman model using a closed-form expression that can
be computed in real time. Using the inverted pendulum system, we illustrate the
robustness of the error bounds given noisy measurements of unknown dynamics,
where the derivatives are estimated numerically. When combined with control,
the Koopman representation of the nonlinear system has marginally better
performance than competing nonlinear modeling methods, such as SINDy and NARX.
In addition, as a linear model, the Koopman approach lends itself readily to
efficient control design tools, such as LQR, whereas the other modeling
approaches require nonlinear control methods. The efficacy of the approach is
further demonstrated with simulation and experimental results on the control of
a tail-actuated robotic fish. Experimental results show that the proposed
data-driven control approach outperforms a tuned PID (Proportional Integral
Derivative) controller and that updating the data-driven model online
significantly improves performance in the presence of unmodeled fluid

transition of a thin film of YBa2Cu3O7 was recently identified as due to the
migration of O atoms from the CuO chains of the film. Here we employ
density-functional theory calculations to study the evolution of the electronic
structure of a slab of YBa2 Cu3 O7 in presence of oxygen vacancies under the
influence of an external electric field. We find that under massive electric
fields isolated O atoms are pulled out of the surface consisting of CuO chains.
As vacancies accumulate at the surface, a configuration with vacancies located
in the chains inside the slab becomes energetically preferred thus providing a
driving force for O migration towards the surface. Regardless of the defect
configuration studied, the electric field is always fully screened near the
surface thus negligibly affecting diffusion barriers across the film.

PGM-Explainer, a Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) model-agnostic explainer

that prediction. Different from existing explainers for GNNs where the
explanations are drawn from a set of linear functions of explained features,
PGM-Explainer is able to demonstrate the dependencies of explained features in

the explanation returned by PGM-Explainer contains the same set of independence

from the accretion disk during an X-ray burst implying strong coronal cooling
by burst photons. Here, we use the plasma emission code EQPAIR to study the
impact of X-ray bursts on coronae, and how the coronal and burst properties
affect the coronal electron temperatures and emitted spectra. Assuming a
constant accretion rate during the burst, our simulations show that soft
photons can cool coronal electrons by a factor of $\gtrsim 10$ and cause a
reduction of emission in the $30$-$50$ keV band to $\lesssim 1\%$ of the
pre-burst emission. This hard X-ray drop is intensified when the coronal
optical depth and aspect ratio is increased. In contrast, depending on the
properties of the burst and corona, the emission in the $8$-$24$ keV band can
either increase, by a factor of $\gtrsim20$, or decrease, down to $\lesssim
1\%$ of the pre-burst emission. An increasing accretion rate during the X-ray
burst reduces the coronal cooling effects and the electron temperature drop can
be mitigated by $\gtrsim60\%$. These results indicate that changes of the hard
X-ray flux during an X-ray burst probe the geometrical properties of the
corona.

steps separating the terraces affect the fractional coverage of {\alpha} vs.
{\beta} termination during crystal growth. To demonstrate how surface X-ray
scattering can help address these questions, we develop a general theory for
the intensity distributions along crystal truncation rods (CTRs) for miscut
surfaces with a combination of two terminations. We consider
half-unit-cell-height steps, and variation of the coverages of the terraces
above each step. Example calculations are presented for the GaN (0001) surface
with various reconstructions. These show which CTR positions are most sensitive
to the fractional coverage of the two terminations. We compare the CTR profiles
for exactly oriented surfaces to those for vicinal surfaces having a small
miscut angle, and investigate the circumstances under which the CTR profile for
an exactly oriented surface is equal to the sum of the intensities of the
corresponding family of CTRs for a miscut surface.

complementing the shallow water hydro-sediment-morphodynamic (SHSM) equations

numerical solution algorithm for the model based on the second-order Strang
operator splitting is presented. The model is partitioned into two parts, (1)
the SHSM equations and (2) the dispersive correction part, which are
discretized using discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. This splitting
technique provides a facility to select dynamically regions of a problem domain
where the dispersive term is not applied, e.g. wave breaking regions where the
dispersive wave model is no longer valid. Algorithms that can handle
wetting-drying and detect wave breaking are provided and a number of numerical
examples are presented to validate the developed numerical solution algorithm.
The results of the simulations indicate that the model is capable of predicting
sediment transport and bed morphodynamic processes correctly provided that the
empirical models for the suspended and bed load transport are properly
calibrated. Moreover, the developed model is able to accurately capture
hydrodynamics and wave dispersion effects up to swash zones, and its
application is justified for simulations where dispersive wave effects are
prevalent.

the sparsity of the network, which describes the number of non-zero weights in

estimators based on fully connected DNNs with sigmoid activation function also
achieve the minimax rates of convergence (up to $\ln n$-factors). In our result
the number of hidden layers is fixed, the number of neurons per layer tends to

with either heterovalent metal, like $La_{2-x}Sr_xCuO_4$, or oxygen, like
$YBa_2Cu_3O_{6+y}$. The difference shows up in the doping dependence of their
incommensurability: $q_c(x) \propto \sqrt{x-\check{p}}$ but $q_c(y) \approx
0.3$. The square-root dependence in the former compound family results from
Coulomb repulsion between doped holes (or electrons), residing pairwise in
lattice-site $O$ (or $Cu$) atoms of the $CuO_2$ planes. The almost constant
$q_c(y)$ value in the second family results from the aggregation of ozone-like
molecules, formed from $O^{2-}$ ions of the host with embedded oxygen atoms,
$O_i$, at interstitial sites in the $CuO_2$ planes. The magnetic moments,
$\mathbf{m}(O)$, of the lattice-defect $O$ atoms in the first family arrange
antiferromagnetically, which gives rise to accompanying magnetization stripes
of incommensurability $q_m(x) = q_c(x)/2$. The ozone complexes have a vanishing
magnetic moment, $\mathbf{m}=0$, which explains the absence of accompanying
magnetization stripes in the second family. Embedding excess oxygen as $O_i$
atoms in $CuO_2$ planes is likewise assumed for $HgBa_2CuO_{4+\delta}$ and
oxygen-enriched bismuth cuprates. A combination of characteristics from both
families is present in oxygen-enriched $La_2CuO_{4+y}$. The validity of
determining the hole density in oxygen-enriched cuprates with the
universal-dome method is independently confirmed. Besides causing different
types of stripes, the two types of lattice-defect oxygen may also cause
different types of superconductivity. This could explain the much higher
$T_{c,max}$ in oxygen-enriched than $Sr$-doped cuprates, as well as the cusped
cooling-curves of X-ray intensity diffracted by stripes in the former family.

the form of bug reports, feature requests, and general misunderstandings as
submitted by customers. Strategies to gather, analyze, and negotiate
requirements are complemented by efforts to manage customer input after
products have been deployed. For the latter, support tickets are key in
allowing customers to submit their issues, bug reports, and feature requests.
Whenever insufficient attention is given to support issues, there is a chance
customers will escalate their issues, and escalation to management is
time-consuming and expensive, especially for large organizations managing
hundreds of customers and thousands of support tickets. This thesis provides a
step towards simplifying the job for support analysts and managers,
particularly in predicting the risk of escalating support tickets. In a field
study at our large industrial partner, IBM, a design science methodology was
employed to characterize the support process and data available to IBM analysts
in managing escalations. Through iterative cycles of design and evaluation,
support analysts' expert knowledge about their customers was translated into
features of a support ticket model to be implemented into a Machine Learning
model to predict support ticket escalations. The Machine Learning model was
trained and evaluated on over 2.5 million support tickets and 10,000
escalations, obtaining a recall of 79.9% and an 80.8% reduction in the workload
for support analysts looking to identify support tickets at risk of escalation.
The features developed in the Support Ticket Model are designed to serve as a
starting place for organizations interested in implementing the model to
predict support ticket escalations, and for future researchers to build on to
advance research in Escalation Prediction.

imaging, such as optics, holography and seismic interferometry. Compared to the
sparse signal recovery problem that uses linear measurements, the unknown is
now a matrix formed by the cross correlation of the unknown signal. Hence, the
bottleneck for inversion is the number of unknowns that grows quadratically.
The main idea of our proposed approach is to reduce the dimensionality of the
problem by recovering only the diagonal of the unknown matrix, whose dimension
grows linearly with the size of the problem. The keystone of the methodology is
the use of an efficient {\em Noise Collector} that absorbs the data that come
from the off-diagonal elements of the unknown matrix and that do not carry
extra information about the support of the signal. This results in a linear
problem whose cost is similar to the one that uses linear measurements. Our
theory shows that the proposed approach provides exact support recovery when
the data is not too noisy, and that there are no false positives for any level
of noise. Moreover, our theory also demonstrates that when using
cross-correlated data, the level of sparsity that can be recovered increases,
scaling almost linearly with the number of data. The numerical experiments
presented in the paper corroborate these findings.

to aid fairer decision making. We illustrate the importance of representativity
fairness in real-world decision making scenarios involving clustering and

  code on AMD, ARM and Intel processors",,,"10.1016/j.cpc.2021.108105",,"cs.DC physics.flu-dyn","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  No area of computing is hungrier for performance than High Performance
Computing (HPC), the demands of which continue to be a major driver for
processor performance and adoption of accelerators, and also advances in
memory, storage, and networking technologies. A key feature of the Intel
processor domination of the past decade has been the extensive adoption of GPUs
as coprocessors, whilst more recent developments have seen the increased
availability of a number of CPU processors, including the novel ARM-based
chips. This paper analyses the performance and scalability of a
state-of-the-art Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code on three HPC cluster
systems equipped with AMD EPYC-Rome (EPYC, 4096 cores), ARM-based Marvell
ThunderX2 (TX2, 8192 cores) and Intel Skylake (SKL, 8000 cores) processors.
Three benchmark cases are designed with increasing computation-to-communication
ratio and numerical complexity, namely lid-driven cavity flow, Taylor-Green
vortex and a travelling solitary wave using the level-set method, adopted with
$4^{th}$-order central-differences or a $5^{th}$-order WENO scheme. Our results
show that the EPYC cluster delivers the best code performance for all the
setups under consideration. In the first two benchmarks, the SKL cluster
demonstrates faster computing times than the TX2 system, whilst in the solitary
wave simulations, the TX2 cluster achieves good scalability and similar
performance to the EPYC system, both improving on that obtained with the SKL
cluster. These results suggest that while the Intel SKL cores deliver the best
strong scalability, the associated cluster performance is lower compared to the
EPYC system. The TX2 cluster performance is promising considering its recent
addition to the HPC portfolio.

algorithms, not efficiently possible on traditional computers, that may lead to
breakthroughs in crucial areas like materials science and chemistry. There is
rapidly growing demand for a quantum workforce educated in the basics of
quantum computing, in particular in quantum programming. However, there are few
offerings for non-specialists and little information on best practices for
training computer science and engineering students.
  In this report we describe our experience teaching an undergraduate course on
quantum computing using a practical, software-driven approach. We centered our
course around teaching quantum algorithms through hands-on programming,
reducing the significance of traditional written assignments and relying
instead on self-paced programming exercises (""Quantum Katas""), a variety of
programming assignments, and a final project. We observed that the programming
sections of the course helped students internalize theoretical material
presented during the lectures. In the survey results, students indicated that
the programming exercises and the final project contributed the most to their
learning process.
  We describe the motivation for centering the course around quantum
programming, discuss major artifacts used in this course, and present our
lessons learned and best practices for a future improved course offering. We
hope that our experience will help guide instructors who want to adopt a
practical approach to teaching quantum computing and will enable more
undergraduate programs to offer quantum programming as an elective.

mitigate this issue, we present a method called neighborhood representative
(NR), which empowers all the existing outlier detectors to efficiently detect
outliers, including collective outliers, while maintaining their computational
integrity. It achieves this by selecting representative objects, scoring these
objects, then applies the score of the representative objects to its collective
objects. Without altering existing detectors, NR is compatible with existing
detectors, while improving performance on real world datasets with +8% (0.72 to
0.78 AUC) relative to state-of-the-art outlier detectors.

the use of natural language for semantic code search has become increasingly
common. The accuracy of the results returned by such systems, however, can be
low due to 1) limited shared vocabulary between code and user query and 2)
inadequate semantic understanding of user query and its relation to code
syntax. Siamese networks are well suited to learning such joint relations
between data, but have not been explored in the context of code search. In this
work, we evaluate Siamese networks for this task by exploring multiple
extraction network architectures. These networks independently process code and
text descriptions before passing them to a Siamese network to learn embeddings
in a common space. We experiment on two different datasets and discover that
Siamese networks can act as strong regularizers on networks that extract rich
information from code and text, which in turn helps achieve impressive
performance on code search beating previous baselines on $2$ programming
languages. We also analyze the embedding space of these networks and provide
directions to fully leverage the power of Siamese networks for semantic code
search.

  Fermionic Media","22 pages",,,,"hep-th hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An overview of hadron spectroscopy obtained from an extension of
superconformal field theory of de Alfaro, Fubini and Furlan, which originates
from the supergauge transformation of Wess and Zumino and influenced on the
string theory are preseted.
  The standard model of hadron dynamics is based on gauge theory. In the 4
dimensional ($4D$) QCD Lagrangian, the Faddeev-Popov ghost that appears to
compensate unphysical degrees of freedom in internal fermion propagators can be
regarded as the partner of a fermion. Donaldson formulated a $5D$ gauge theory.
  Fubini and Rabinovici formulated superconformal quantum mechanics in de
Sitter space, and Brodsky and de T\'eramond formulated relativistic light front
holographic QCD (LFHQCD) in Kaluza-Klein type $5D$ anti de Sitter (AdS) space,
using Dirac's light cone gauge, and succeeded in obtaining spectroscopy of
baryons (fermions) and corresponding mesons (bosons), except the pion which is
an axial scalar meson that remains massless.
  In the LFHQCD, the time parameter $\tau=t\pm z/c$, $(z\in {\bf C})$ appears
by the choice of the light-cone gauge, or the front form of Dirac's
formulation. The theory is an extension of AdS/CFT correspodence of Maldacena
in which incorporation of Einstein's gravity theory in Maxwell's
electromagnetic theory was tried in the framework of the string theory.
  Taking mathematical frameworks of treating the supersymmetry by Brodsky,
Witten, Connes and their collaborators as central thema, we summarize other
supersymmetric approaches like string theory in particle physics and
astrophysics. We discuss about 2 dimensional solitons whose dynamics is
represented also by $\tau=t\pm z/c$, ($z\in$ pure quaternion${\bf H}$).

metallic shallow phosphorus doped layer in a silicon micro-ring cavity that can
function at cryogenic temperatures. We verify that the shallow doping layer
affects the local refractive index while inducing minimal losses with quality
factors up to 10$^5$. This demonstration opens up a pathway to the integration
of an electronic device, such as a single-electron transistor, into an optical

what drives such variability? Through six open datasets, including actual human
mobility, we estimated the association between mobility and the growth rate of
COVID-19 cases across 3,107 U.S. counties, generalizing previous reports. In
addition, data from the 2016 U.S. presidential election was used to measure how
the association between mobility and COVID-19 growth rate differed based on
voting patterns. A significant association between political leaning and the
COVID-19 growth rate was measured. Our results demonstrate that political
orientation may inform models predicting the impact of policies in reducing the
