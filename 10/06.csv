appraised in meta-research, mostly focusing on the completeness of their
statistical inferences and the fidelity of their statistical reporting.
However, estimates of the field's distribution of statistical power and its
publication bias have not received much attention. Aim. In this study, we aim
to estimate the effect sizes and their standard errors present as well as the
implications on statistical power and publication bias. Method. We built upon a
published systematic literature review of $146$ user studies in cyber security
(2006--2016). We took into account $431$ statistical inferences including $t$-,
$\chi^2$-, $r$-, one-way $F$-tests, and $Z$-tests. In addition, we coded the
corresponding total sample sizes, group sizes and test families. Given these
data, we established the observed effect sizes and evaluated the overall
publication bias. We further computed the statistical power vis-{\`a}-vis of
parametrized population thresholds to gain unbiased estimates of the power
distribution. Results. We obtained a distribution of effect sizes and their
conversion into comparable log odds ratios together with their standard errors.
We, further, gained funnel-plot estimates of the publication bias present in
the sample as well as insights into the power distribution and its
consequences. Conclusions. Through the lenses of power and publication bias, we
shed light on the statistical reliability of the studies in the field. The
upshot of this introspection is practical recommendations on conducting and
evaluating studies to advance the field.

Quantifying atmospheric dynamics of hot planets is critical to a complete

other planetary properties, such as magnetic field strengths. In this
manuscript we present the first detection of the Balmer lines H$\alpha$ and
H$\beta$ in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-33 b. Using
atmospheric models which include the effects of atmospheric dynamics, we show
that the shape of the average Balmer line transmission spectrum is consistent
with rotational velocities in the planet's thermosphere of $v_\text{rot} =
10.1^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$ km s$^{-1}$. We also measure a low-significance
day-to-night side velocity shift of $-4.6^{+3.4}_{-3.4}$ km s$^{-1}$ in the
transmission spectrum which is naturally explained by a global wind across the
planet's terminator. In a separate analysis the time-resolved velocity
centroids of individual transmission spectra show unambiguous evidence of
rotation, with a best-fit velocity of $10.0^{+2.4}_{-2.0}$ km s$^{-1}$,
consistent with the value of $v_\text{rot}$ derived from the shape of the
average Balmer line transmission spectrum. Our observations and analysis
confirm the power of high signal-to-noise, time-resolved transmission spectra
to measure the velocity structures in exoplanet atmospheres. The large
rotational and wind velocities we measure highlight the need for more detailed
3D global climate simulations of the rarefied upper-atmospheres of ultra-hot
gas giants.

in the first order formalism, where the full superconformal structure can be
kept manifest in principle, even if only a part of it is realized as a symmetry
on the boundary, while the remainder has a non-linear realization. Our study
generalizes the results presented in antecedent literature and includes a
general discussion of the gauge-fixing conditions on the bulk fields which
yield the asymptotic symmetries at the boundary. We construct the corresponding
superconformal currents and show that they satisfy the related Ward identities
when the bulk equations of motion are imposed.
  Consistency of the holographic setup requires the super-AdS curvatures to
vanish at the boundary. This determines, in particular, the expression of the
super-Schouten tensor of the boundary theory, which generalizes the purely
bosonic Schouten tensor of standard gravity by including gravitini bilinears.
The same applies to the superpartner of the super-Schouten tensor, the
conformino. Furthermore, the vanishing of the supertorsion poses general
constraints on the sources of the three-dimensional boundary conformal field
theory and requires that the super-Schouten tensor is endowed with an
antisymmetric part proportional to a gravitino-squared term.

the covariance function that need to be estimated from the data. We study the
Bayesian fixed-domain asymptotics for the covariance parameters in a universal
kriging model with an isotropic Matern covariance function, which has many
applications in spatial statistics. We show that when the dimension of domain
is less than or equal to three, the joint posterior distribution of the
microergodic parameter and the range parameter can be factored independently
into the product of their marginal posteriors under fixed-domain asymptotics.
The posterior of the microergodic parameter is asymptotically close in total
variation distance to a normal distribution with shrinking variance, while the
posterior distribution of the range parameter does not converge to any point
mass distribution in general. Our theory allows an unbounded prior support for
the range parameter and flexible designs of sampling points. We further study
the asymptotic efficiency and convergence rates in posterior prediction for the
Bayesian kriging predictor with covariance parameters randomly drawn from their
posterior distribution. In the special case of one-dimensional
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we derive explicitly the limiting posterior of the
range parameter and the posterior convergence rate for asymptotic efficiency in
posterior prediction. We verify these asymptotic results in numerical
experiments.

overexpression of cytokeratin (CK) or epithelial cell-adhesion molecule (EpCAM)
on cancer cells. However, during the process of metastasis, tumor cells undergo
epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) that can lead to the loss of
CK/EpCAM expression. Therefore, it is vital to develop a capturing technique
independent of CK/EpCAM expression on the cancer cell. To develop this
technique, it is important to identify common secondary oncogenic markers
overexpressed on tumor cells before and after EMT. We analyzed the biomarker
expression levels in tumor cells, before and after EMT, and found two common
proteins human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2) and epidermal growth
factor receptor (EGFR) whose levels remained unaffected. So, we synthesized
immunomagnetic iron nanocubes covalently conjugated with antibodies of Her2 or
EGFR to capture cancer cells irrespective of the EMT status. The nanocubes
showed high specificity (6 to 9 fold) in isolating the cancer cells of interest
from a mixture of cells spiked in serum. We characterized the captured cells
for identifying their EMT status. Thus, we believe the results presented here
would help in the development of novel strategies for capturing both primary

to the advent of oxygenic photosynthesis, the most primitive phototrophs,
anoxygenic phototrophs, dominated surface environments on the planet. Here, we
characterize surface polarization biosignatures associated with a diverse
sample of anoxygenic phototrophs and cyanobacteria, examining both pure
cultures and microbial communities from the natural environment. Polarimetry is
a tool that can be used to measure the chiral signature of biomolecules.
Chirality is considered a universal, agnostic biosignature that is independent
of a planet's biochemistry, receiving considerable interest as a target
biosignature for life detection missions. In contrast to preliminary
indications from earlier work, we show that there is a diversity of distinctive
circular polarization signatures, including the magnitude of the polarization,
associated with the variety of chiral photosynthetic pigments and pigment
complexes of anoxygenic and oxygenic phototrophs. We also show that the
apparent death and release of pigments from one of the phototrophs is
accompanied by an elevation of the reflectance polarization signal by an order
of magnitude, which may be significant for remotely detectable environmental
signatures. This work and others suggest circular polarization signals up to
~1% may occur, significantly stronger than previously anticipated circular
polarization levels. We conclude that global surface polarization biosignatures
may arise from anoxygenic and oxygenic phototrophs, which have dominated nearly
80% of the history of our rocky, inhabited planet.

from the shear rheology of the emulsion. Such comparison highlights that a
suitable degree $\Lambda$ of coarse-graining needs to be introduced in the

we expect that all bots are eventually recognized as such, we incorporate a
metric that measures which chatbot can uphold human-like behavior the longest,
i.e., \emph{Survival Analysis}. This metric has the ability to correlate a
bot's performance to certain of its characteristics (e.g., \ fluency or

data requirements, distributed computing becomes necessary to satisfy the
growing computational and storage demands, because it enables parallel
execution of smaller tasks that make up a large computing job. However, random
fluctuations in task service times lead to straggling tasks with long execution
times. Redundancy, in the form of task replication and erasure coding, provides
diversity that allows a job to be completed when only a subset of redundant
tasks is executed, thus removing the dependency on the straggling tasks. In
situations of constrained resources (here a fixed number of parallel servers),
increasing redundancy reduces the available resources for parallelism. In this
paper, we characterize the diversity vs. parallelism trade-off and identify the
optimal strategy, among replication, coding and splitting, which minimizes the
expected job completion time. We consider three common service time
distributions and establish three models that describe scaling of these
distributions with the task size. We find that different distributions with
different scaling models operate optimally at different levels of redundancy,
and thus may require very different code rates.

dynamically through a network, in which edges are equipped with transit times,
specifying the traversing time, and with capacities, restricting flow rates.
Infinitesimally small flow particles controlled by the same player arrive at a
constant rate at the player's origin and the player's goal is to maximize the
flow volume that arrives at the player's destination within a given time
horizon. Hereby, the flow dynamics described by the deterministic queuing
model, i.e., flow of different players merges perfectly, but excessive flow has
to wait in a queue in front of the bottle-neck. In order to determine Nash
equilibria in such games, the main challenge is to consider suitable
definitions for the players' strategies, which depend on the level of
information the players receive throughout the game. For the most restricted
version, in which the players receive no information on the network state at
all, we can show that there is no Nash equilibrium in general, not even for
networks with only two edges. However, if the current edge congestions are
provided over time, the players can adopt their route choices dynamically. We
show that a profile of those strategies always lead to a unique feasible flow
over time. Hence, those atomic splittable flow over time games are
well-defined. For parallel-edge networks Nash equilibria exists and the total
flow arriving in time equals the value of a maximum flow over time leading to a
price of anarchy of 1.

abundance using spatially resolved observations and inversions. We seek to
derive the photospheric solar oxygen abundance with a method that is robust
against uncertainties in the model atmosphere.
  Methods. We use observations with spatial resolution obtained at the Vacuum
Tower Telescope (VTT) to derive the oxygen abundance at 40 different spatial
positions in granules and intergranular lanes. We first obtain a model for each
location by inverting the Fe I lines with the NICOLE inversion code. These
models are then integrated into a hierarchical Bayesian model that is used to
infer the most probable value for the oxygen abundance that is compatible with
all the observations. The abundance is derived from the [O I] forbidden line at
6300 {\AA} taking into consideration all possible nuisance parameters that can
affect the abundance.
  Results. Our results show good agreement in the inferred oxygen abundance for
all the pixels analyzed, demonstrating the robustness of the analysis against
possible systematic errors in the model. We find a slightly higher oxygen
abundance in granules than in intergranular lanes when treated separately
(log(\epsilon_O) = 8.83 \pm 0.02 vs log(\epsilon_O) = 8.76 \pm 0.02), which is
a difference of approximately 2-{\sigma}. This tension suggests that some
systematic errors in the model or the radiative transfer still exist but are
small. When taking all pixels together, we obtain an oxygen abundance of
log(\epsilon_O)=8.80 \pm 0.03, which is compatible with both granules and lanes
within 1-{\sigma}. The spread of results is due to both systematic and random
errors.

fixed mesh topology limits the ability to achieve the target size and
aspect-ratio at each position, in this paper we augment the $r$-adaptivity
framework with nonconforming adaptive mesh refinement to further reduce the
error with respect to the target geometric parameters. The proposed
formulation, referred to as $hr$-adaptivity, introduces TMOP-based quality
estimators to satisfy the aspect-ratio-target via anisotropic refinements and
size-target via isotropic refinements in each element of the mesh. The
methodology presented is purely algebraic, extends to both simplices and
hexahedra/quadrilaterals of any order, and supports nonconforming isotropic and
anisotropic refinements in 2D and 3D. Using a problem with a known exact
solution, we demonstrate the effectiveness of $hr$-adaptivity over both $r-$
and $h$-adaptivity in obtaining similar accuracy in the solution with
significantly fewer degrees of freedom. We also present several examples that
show that $hr$-adaptivity can help satisfy geometric targets even when
$r$-adaptivity fails to do so, due to the topology of the initial mesh.

diodes (OLEDs) constitute near-perfect two-level systems to explore the
interaction of light and matter in the ultrastrong-drive regime. Under such
highly non-perturbative conditions, the frequency at which the spin oscillates
between states, the Rabi frequency, becomes comparable to its natural resonance
frequency, the Larmor frequency. For such conditions, we develop an intuitive
understanding of the emergence of hybrid light-matter states, illustrating how
dipole-forbidden multiple-quantum transitions at integer and fractional
g-factors arise. A rigorous theoretical treatment of the phenomena comes from a
Floquet-style solution to the time-dependent Hamiltonian of the electron-hole
spin pair under resonant drive. To probe these phenomena experimentally
requires both the development of a magnetic-resonance setup capable of
supporting oscillating driving fields comparable in magnitude to the static
field defining the Zeeman splitting; and an organic semiconductor which is
characterized by minimal inhomogeneous broadening so as to allow the non-linear
light-matter interactions to be resolved. The predicted exotic resonance
features associated with the Floquet states are indeed found experimentally in
measurements of spin-dependent steady-state OLED current under resonant drive,
demonstrating that complex hybrid light-matter spin excitations can be formed
and probed at room temperature. The spin-Dicke state arising under strong drive
is insensitive to power broadening so that the Bloch-Siegert shift of the
resonance becomes apparent, implying long coherence times of the dressed spin
state with potential applicability for quantum sensing.

that the lexical ambiguity of a word type should correlate with how much

is the case, we operationalise the lexical ambiguity of a word as the entropy
of meanings it can take, and provide two ways to estimate this -- one which
requires human annotation (using WordNet), and one which does not (using BERT),
making it readily applicable to a large number of languages. We validate these
measures by showing that, on six high-resource languages, there are significant
Pearson correlations between our BERT-based estimate of ambiguity and the
number of synonyms a word has in WordNet (e.g. $\rho = 0.40$ in English). We
then test our main hypothesis -- that a word's lexical ambiguity should
negatively correlate with its contextual uncertainty -- and find significant
correlations on all 18 typologically diverse languages we analyse. This
suggests that, in the presence of ambiguity, speakers compensate by making

algorithm that only requires classical access to data. Our quantum classifier
is a conventional support vector machine that uses a fault-tolerant quantum
computer to estimate a kernel function. Data samples are mapped to a quantum
feature space and the kernel entries can be estimated as the transition
amplitude of a quantum circuit. We construct a family of datasets and show that
no classical learner can classify the data inverse-polynomially better than
random guessing, assuming the widely-believed hardness of the discrete
logarithm problem. Meanwhile, the quantum classifier achieves high accuracy and
is robust against additive errors in the kernel entries that arise from finite
sampling statistics.

the values of all measures of quantum correlations in comparison to their SM

SatCom can mitigate the problems occurring in RF SatCom, while providing
important advantages, including reduced mass, lower consumption, better
throughput, and lower costs. Furthermore, laser SatCom is inherently resistant
to jamming, interception, and interference. Owing to these benefits, this paper
focuses on downlink laser SatCom, where the best ground station (GS) is
selected among numerous candidates to provide reliable connectivity and maximum
site diversity. To quantify the performance of the proposed scheme, we derive
closed-form outage probability and ergodic capacity expressions for two
different practical GS deployment scenarios. Furthermore, asymptotic analysis
is conducted to obtain the overall site diversity gain, and aperture averaging
is studied to illustrate the impact of aperture diameter on the overall

uses hand-crafted scores to recommend sentences but has difficulty in adopting
such scores to all the near-synonyms as near-synonyms differ in various ways.
We notice that the helpfulness of the learning material would reflect on the

probing tasks, such as part-of-speech labeling and dependency arc labeling, are
inadequate to evaluate the linguistic structure encoded in contextual word

due to its potential to reveal structures in turbulent flows, to guide
sensor/actuator placement, and for flow control applications. However,
resolvent analysis requires access to high-fidelity numerical solvers to
produce the linearized dynamics operator. In this work, we develop a purely
data-driven algorithm to perform resolvent analysis to obtain the leading
forcing and response modes, without recourse to the governing equations, but
instead based on snapshots of the transient evolution of linearly stable flows.
The formulation of our method follows from two established facts: $1)$ dynamic
mode decomposition can approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
underlying operator governing the evolution of a system from measurement data,
and $2)$ a projection of the resolvent operator onto an invariant subspace can
be built from this learned eigendecomposition. We demonstrate the method on
numerical data of the linearized complex Ginzburg--Landau equation and of
three-dimensional transitional channel flow, and discuss data requirements. The
ability to perform resolvent analysis in a completely equation-free and

this theory is not applicable to every-day traffic scenarios. For this reason
we consider Nash flows over time in a setting with multiple commodities, each
with a individual origin and destination. We prove their existence with the
help of multi-commodity thin flows with resetting. This proof gives some
interesting structural insights into the strategy profiles underlying the

GHz (Band 7) ALMA Atacama Compact Array observations of four bright and stable
young stellar objects over 7 epochs to independently assess the accuracy of the
ALMA flux calibration and to refine the relative calibration across epochs. The
use of these four extra calibrators allow us to achieve an unprecedented
relative ALMA calibration accuracy of $\sim 3\%$. On the other hand, when the
observatory calibrator catalog is not up-to-date, the Band 7 data calibrated by
the ALMA pipeline may have a flux calibration poorer than the nominal 10\%,
which can be exacerbated by weather-related phase decorrelation when
self-calibration of the science target is either not possible or not attempted.

windows of 0.8\%, implying that measuring spectral indices within a single ALMA

practice from a neighbor and pass it along to someone else. For over 100 years,
scholars of social contagion have almost exclusively made the same implicit
assumption: that only one belief, idea, or practice spreads through the
population at a time. It is a default assumption that we don't bother to state,
let alone justify. The assumption is so ingrained that our literature doesn't
even have a word for ""whatever is to be diffused"", because we have never needed
to discuss more than one of them. But this assumption is obviously false.
Millions of beliefs, ideas, and practices (let's call them ""diffusants"") spread
through social contagion every day. To assume that diffusants spread one at a
time - or more generously, that they spread independently of one another - is
to assume that interactions between diffusants have no influence on adoption
patterns. This could be true, or it could be wildly off the mark. We've never
stopped to find out. This paper makes a direct comparison between the spread of
independent and interdependent beliefs using simulations, observational data,

between diffusants, scholars have overlooked social processes that
fundamentally change the outcomes of social contagion. Interdependence between
beliefs generates polarization, irrespective of social network structure,
homophily, demographics, politics, or any other commonly cited cause. It also
coordinates structures of beliefs that can have both internal justification and
social support without any grounding in external truth.

learning behaviors from imagined outcomes to increase sample-efficiency. While
learning world models from image inputs has recently become feasible for some
tasks, modeling Atari games accurately enough to derive successful behaviors
has remained an open challenge for many years. We introduce DreamerV2, a
reinforcement learning agent that learns behaviors purely from predictions in
the compact latent space of a powerful world model. The world model uses
discrete representations and is trained separately from the policy. DreamerV2
constitutes the first agent that achieves human-level performance on the Atari
benchmark of 55 tasks by learning behaviors inside a separately trained world
model. With the same computational budget and wall-clock time, Dreamer V2
reaches 200M frames and surpasses the final performance of the top single-GPU
agents IQN and Rainbow. DreamerV2 is also applicable to tasks with continuous
actions, where it learns an accurate world model of a complex humanoid robot
and solves stand-up and walking from only pixel inputs.

do atoms spend in the excited state? Does the answer depend on whether the
photon is ultimately absorbed or transmitted? In particular, if it is
$\textit{not}$ absorbed, does it cause atoms to spend any time in the excited
state, and if so, how much? In an experiment with ultra-cold Rubidium atoms, we
simultaneously record whether atoms are excited by incident (""signal"") photons
and whether those photons are transmitted. We measure the time spent by atoms
in the excited state by using a separate, off-resonant ""probe"" laser to monitor
the index of refraction of the sample - that is, we measure the nonlinear phase
shift written by a signal pulse on this probe beam - and use direct detection
to isolate the effect of single transmitted photons. For short pulses (10 ns,
to be compared to the 26 ns atomic lifetime) and an optically thick medium
(peak OD = 4, leading to 60% absorption given our broad bandwidth), we find
that the average time atoms spend in the excited state due to one transmitted
photon is not zero, but rather (77 $\pm$ 16)% of the time the average incident
photon causes them to spend in the excited state. We attribute this observation
of ""excitation without loss"" to coherent forward emission, which can arise when
the instantaneous Rabi frequency (pulse envelope) picks up a phase flip - this
happens naturally when a broadband pulse propagates through an optically thick
medium with frequency-dependent absorption [1]. These results unambiguously
reveal the complex history of photons as they propagate through an absorbing
medium and illustrate the power of utilizing post-selection to experimentally
investigate the past behaviour of observed quantum systems.

Dust-to-gas mass ratios (DGRs) in the tails are analysed as a function of the
galaxy mass, metallicity, and dust temperature. Along the stripped component,
the dust distribution closely follows the HI and H$\alpha$ emitting gas, all
extending beyond the optical disc. In these regions, the DGRs are
$2.0\pm0.6\times10^{-3}$, $0.7\pm0.1\times10^{-3}$, and
$0.4\pm0.03\times10^{-3}$, for NGC 4330, NGC 4522, and NGC 4654, respectively,
i.e. up to a factor of 15 less than the values measured in the main body of
nearby galaxies. We also find a negative trend in the DGR as a function of the
metallicity that can be explained in terms of a dust component more centrally
concentrated in more metal-rich systems. Together with the finding that the
stripped dust is cold, $T_{d} \lesssim 25\, K$, our results support an
outside-in stripping scenario of the galaxy interstellar medium. This study
shows that ram pressure stripping is a key mechanism in the building up of the

because explosions of massive Pop III stars produce more turbulence that
suppresses high-mass second-generation star formation. Our models suggest that
the Pop III IMF could therefore be inferred from detections of primordial

gapless superconducting state, zero-energy quasiparticles reside on a segment
of the normal state Fermi surface, while its remaining part is still gapped.
The finite density of states of field-induced quasiparticles, known as the
Volovik effect, has been observed in tunneling and specific heat measurements

finite-momentum state carrying a supercurrent has never been detected directly.
Here we use quasiparticle interference (QPI) technique to image

to $5.6\times10^{-4}$Hz, which opens up a unique GW observing window for
supermassive black hole binaries and their waveform evolution. While the
detection threshold assuming the currently expected performance proves too high
for detecting individual GWs in light of the expected supermassive black hole
binary population distribution, we show that binaries with chirp mass
$M_c>10^{8.3}~M_\odot$ out to 100 Mpc can be detected if the telescope is able
to achieve an astrometric accuracy of 0.11 mas. To confidently detect binaries
with $M_c>10^{7}~M_\odot$ out to 50 Mpc, a factor of 100 sensitivity
improvement is required. We propose several improvement strategies, including
recovering the mean astrometric deflection and increasing astrometric accuracy,
number of observed stars, field-of-view size, and observational cadence. We
discuss how other existing and planned photometric surveys could contribute to
detecting GWs via astrometry.

dark-matter-rich, as baryonic feedback is thought to quickly drive gas out of
their shallow potential wells and quench star formation at early epochs. Recent
observations of local dwarfs with extremely low dark matter content appear to
contradict this picture, potentially bringing the validity of the standard
model into question. We use NewHorizon, a high-resolution cosmological
simulation, to demonstrate that sustained stripping of dark matter, in tidal
interactions between a massive galaxy and a dwarf satellite, naturally produces
dwarfs that are dark-matter-deficient, even though their initial dark matter
fractions are normal. The process of dark matter stripping is responsible for
the large scatter in the halo-to-stellar mass relation in the dwarf regime. The
degree of stripping is driven by the closeness of the orbit of the dwarf around
its massive companion and, in extreme cases, produces dwarfs with
halo-to-stellar mass ratios as low as unity, consistent with the findings of
recent observational studies. ~30 per cent of dwarfs show some deviation from
normal dark matter fractions due to dark matter stripping, with 10 per cent
showing high levels of dark matter deficiency (Mhalo/M*<10). Given their close
orbits, a significant fraction of dark-matter-deficient dwarfs merge with their
massive companions (e.g. ~70 per cent merge over timescales of ~3.5 Gyrs), with
the dark-matter-deficient population being constantly replenished by new
interactions between dwarfs and massive companions. The creation of these
galaxies is, therefore, a natural by-product of galaxy evolution and their
existence is not in tension with the standard paradigm.

Sct variables in NGC 419, an intermediate-age globular cluster of the Small
Magellanic Cloud (SMC), using $g,r,i$ Gemini-S/GMOS time series observations.
Our goal is to study the role of such variables in the cluster extended
main-sequence turnoff (MSTO). We report the discovery of 54 $\delta$ Sct stars
and three eclipsing binaries in the NGC 419 field. We find only a handful of
the $\delta$ Sct stars at the MSTO of NGC 419 while the majority is fainter,
indicating that the cluster is younger ($\lesssim 1.2$ Gyr) than previously
thought. Considering their radial distribution, we identify only six $\delta$
Sct stars as probable members of NGC 419 while the 48 remaining are likely
$\delta$ Sct stars of the SMC field. Cluster $\delta$ Sct stars appear close to
the red edge of the MSTO, supporting the idea that the extended MSTO has its
origin in an age spread. The 48 field $\delta$ Sct stars represent the largest
detection of $\delta$ Sct stars made in the SMC. The period distribution of
these newly detected $\delta$ Sct stars ($0.04 \lesssim P \lesssim 0.15$ d) is
similar to that detected in other systems. The amplitude distribution ($0.05
\lesssim \Delta r \lesssim 0.60$ mag) is likely biased because of the lack of
low-amplitude stars. We finally use the $\delta$ Sct stars to calculate
distances using different period-luminosity relations. The average distance
moduli obtained are $18.76\pm0.14$ mag for NGC 419 and $18.86\pm0.11$ mag for
the SMC field, which agree with previous measurements.

quantum mechanics must live on them. Charge violation occurs in the anomalous

Illustris. We identify 134 KDCs, study their properties, and follow their
evolution back in time. Examples of four galaxies hosting KDCs are presented
and described in detail. The masses of the KDC hosts follow the general
distribution of the Illustris galaxies, with a possible slight preference
towards massive galaxies. KDCs can be long-lived features, with their formation
epochs roughly uniformly distributed in look-back times 0-11.4 Gyr, and they
can survive even major or multiple subsequent mergers. There is no single
channel of KDC formation, but mergers seem to be the formation mechanism for
about 60% of KDCs with a significant preference for major mergers and with the
percentage being higher among massive hosts. Other KDCs formed during a
pericentric passage or flyby of another galaxy, by precession of a previously
formed rapidly rotating core, or without an obvious external cause. The mean
mass-weighted stellar age inside the KDC radius is either about the same as the
look-back time of the KDC formation or older. Although the radii of our KDCs
are on average larger than observed, we find that younger stellar ages are
typically associated with smaller KDCs. A significant fraction of KDC hosts
possess stellar shells formed during mergers that led to KDCs within the last 5
Gyr, or double peaks in their velocity dispersion maps.

the likeness of the X-ray morphologies and the remarkable symmetry of the radio

Astroparticle Physics. An excess of gamma rays (GCE) has been measured by
several groups in the data collected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)
towards the Galactic center region. The spectrum and spatial morphology of the
GCE have been claimed by some groups to be compatible with a signal from the
Galactic halo of dark matter (DM). Instead, other analyses have demonstrated
that the GCE properties, e.g., its energy spectrum, highly depend on the choice
of the Galactic interstellar emission (IEM) model source catalogs and analysis
techniques. In this paper we investigate the sensitivity of Fermi-LAT to detect
the characteristics of the GCE. In particular we simulate the GCE as given by
DM and we verify that, with a perfect knowledge of the background components,
its energy spectrum, position, spatial morphology and symmetry is properly
measured. We also inspect two more realist cases for which there are
imperfections in the IEM model. In the first we have an un-modeled gamma-ray
source, constituted by the low-latitude component of the Fermi bubbles. In the
second we simulate the data with one IEM template and analyze the data with an
other. We verify that a mismodeling of the IEM introduces a systematics of
about 10-15% in the GCE energy spectrum between 1-10 GeV and about 5% in the
value of the slope for a NFW DM density profile, which is used to fit the GCE
spatial morphology. Finally, we show how the GCE would be detected in case of
alternative processes such as gamma-ray emission from a bulge population of
pulsars or from electrons and positrons or protons injected from the Galactic
center. We demonstrate that for each of these cases there is a distinctive
smoking gun signature that would help to identify the real mechanism behind the
origin of the GCE.

design and selection of absorptive materials that should be compatible with
cryogenic operating environments. While a wide selection of absorptive
materials exists, these typically exhibit high indices of refraction and
reflect/scatter a significant fraction of light before absorption. For many
lower index materials such as commercial microwave absorbers, their

present a new tool to control stray light: metamaterial microwave absorber
tiles. These tiles comprise an outer metamaterial layer that approximates a
lossy gradient index anti-reflection coating. They are fabricated via injection
molding commercially available carbon-loaded polyurethane (25\% by mass). The
injection molding technology enables mass production at low cost. The design of
these tiles is presented, along with thermal tests to 1 K. Room temperature
optical measurements verify their control of reflectance to less than 1\% up to
65$\circ$ angles of incidence, and control of wide angle scattering below
0.01\%. The dielectric properties of the bulk carbon-loaded material used in
the tiles is also measured at different temperatures, confirming that the
material maintains similar dielectric properties down to 3 K.

Kuiper Belt (TNOs) has recently prompted the prediction of an additional planet
in the outer solar system. Since the initial posing of the hypothesis, the
effects of Planet Nine on the dynamics of the main cluster of TNOs - the
objects anti-aligned with its orbit - have been well-studied. In particular,
numerical simulations have revealed a fascinating phenomenon, referred to as
""resonance hopping"", in which these objects abruptly transition between
different mean-motion commensurabilities with Planet Nine. In this work, we
explore this effect in greater detail, with the goal of understanding what
mechanism prompts the hopping events to occur. In the process, we elucidate the
often underestimated role of Neptune scattering interactions, which leads to
diffusion in the semi-major axes of these distant TNOs. In addition, we
demonstrate that although some resonant interactions with Planet Nine do occur,
the anti-aligned objects are able to survive without the resonances, confirming
that the dynamics of the TNOs are predominantly driven by secular, rather than
resonant, interactions with Planet Nine.

holes (BHs) between $\approx{}40-65$ M$_\odot$ and $\approx{}120$ M$_\odot$.
The existence of the mass gap is currently being challenged by the detection of
GW190521, with a primary component mass of $85^{+21}_{-14}$ M$_{\odot}$. Here,
we investigate the main uncertainties on the PI mass gap: the
$^{12}$C($\alpha$, $\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction rate and the H-rich envelope
collapse. With the standard $^{12}$C($\alpha$, $\gamma$)$^{16}$O rate, the
lower edge of the mass gap can be 70 M$_\odot$ if we allow for the collapse of
the residual H-rich envelope at metallicity $Z\leq{}0.0003$. Adopting the
uncertainties given by the STARLIB database, for models computed with the
$^{12}$C($\alpha$, $\gamma$)$^{16}$O rate $-1\, \sigma$, we find that the PI
mass gap ranges between $\approx{}80$ M$_\odot$ and $\approx{}150$ M$_\odot$.
Stars with $M_{\rm ZAMS}>110$ M$_\odot$ may experience a deep dredge-up episode
during the core helium-burning phase, that extracts matter from the core
enriching the envelope. As a consequence of the He-core mass reduction, a star
with $M_{\rm ZAMS} =160$ M$_\odot$ may avoid the PI and produce a BH of 150
M$_\odot$. In the $-2\,{}\sigma{}$ case, the PI mass gap ranges from 92
M$_\odot$ to 110 M$_\odot$. Finally, in models computed with $^{12}$C($\alpha$,
$\gamma$)$^{16}$O $-3\,{}\sigma{}$, the mass gap is completely removed by the
dredge-up effect. The onset of this dredge-up is particularly sensitive to the
assumed model for convection and mixing. The combined effect of H-rich envelope
collapse and low $^{12}$C($\alpha$, $\gamma$)$^{16}$O rate can lead to the
formation of BHs with masses consistent with the primary component of GW190521.

correction competitive information about the specific noise is required.
Traditionally, this information is obtained by benchmarking the device before
operation. We address the question of what can be learned from only the
measurements done during decoding. Such estimation of noise models was proposed
for surface codes, exploiting their special structure, and in the limit of low
error rates also for other codes. However, so far it has been unclear under
what general conditions noise models can be estimated from the syndrome
measurements. In this work, we derive a general condition for identifiability
of the error rates. For general stabilizer codes, we prove identifiability
under the assumption that the rates are small enough. Without this assumption
we prove a result for perfect codes. Finally, we propose a practical estimation
method with linear runtime for concatenated codes. We demonstrate that it
outperforms other recently proposed methods and that the estimation is optimal

presented that is fully nonlinear, provides a complete information theoretic
disentanglement of causal processes, allows for nonlinear interactions between
causes, identifies the causal strength of missing or unknown processes, and can
analyze systems that cannot be represented on Directed Acyclic Graphs. The
basic building blocks are information theoretic measures such as (conditional)
mutual information and a new concept called certainty that monotonically
increases with the information available about the target process. The
framework is presented in detail and compared with other existing frameworks,
and the treatment of confounders is discussed. While there are systems with
structures that the framework cannot disentangle, it is argued that any causal
framework that is based on integrated quantities will miss out potentially
important information of the underlying probability density functions. The
framework is tested on several highly simplified stochastic processes to
demonstrate how blocking and gateways are handled, and on the chaotic Lorentz

Building on previous ALMA surveys at 0.89 and 1.3 mm that observed the complete
sample of Class II discs in Lupus at a comparable resolution, we aim to assess
the level of grain growth in the relatively young Lupus region. We measure 3 mm
integrated fluxes, from which we derive disc-averaged 1-3 mm spectral indices.
We find that the mean spectral index of the observed Lupus discs is
$\alpha_\mathrm{1-3 mm}=2.23\pm0.06$, in all cases $\alpha_\mathrm{1-3

and in transition discs. Furthermore, we find that the distribution of spectral
indices in Lupus discs is statistically indistinguishable from that of the
Taurus and Ophiuchus star-forming regions. Assuming the emission is optically
thin, the low values $\alpha_\mathrm{1-3 mm}\leq 2.5$ measured for most discs
can be interpreted with the presence of grains larger than 1 mm. The
observations of the faint discs in the sample can be explained without invoking
the presence of large grains, namely through a mixture of optically thin and
optically thick emission from small grains. However, the bright (and typically
large) discs do inescapably require the presence of millimeter-sized grains in
order to have realistic masses. Based on a disc mass argument, our results
challenge previous claims that the presence of optically thick sub-structures
may be a universal explanation for the empirical millimeter size-luminosity
correlation observed at 0.89 mm.

characterise the discs multi-wavelength brightness profiles by fitting the
interferometric visibilities in a homogeneous way, obtaining effective disc
sizes at the three wavelengths, spectral index profiles and optical depth
estimates. We report three fundamental discoveries: first, the millimeter
continuum size - luminosity relation already observed at 0.9 mm is also present
at 1.3 mm with an identical slope, and at 3.1 mm with a steeper slope,
confirming that emission at longer wavelengths becomes increasingly optically
thin. Second, when observed at 3.1 mm the discs appear to be only 9% smaller
than when observed at 0.9 mm, in tension with models of dust evolution which
predict a starker difference. Third, by forward modelling the sample of
measurements with a simple parametric disc model, we find that the presence of
large grains ($a_\mathrm{max}>1 $mm) throughout the discs is the most favoured
explanation for all discs as it reproduces simultaneously their spectral
indices, optical depth, luminosity, and radial extent in the 0.9-1.3 mm
wavelength range. We also find that the observations can be alternatively
interpreted with the discs being dominated by optically thick, unresolved,
substructures made of mm-sized grains with a high scattering albedo.

submillimetre galaxies are simply the tail of the broader submillimetre
population, with comparable dust and stellar masses to K<25.3 mag submillimetre
galaxies, but lying at significantly higher redshifts (z=3.44+/-0.06 versus
z=2.36+/-0.11) and having higher dust attenuation (Av=5.2+/-0.3 versus

find indications that these K-faint galaxies have smaller dust continuum sizes
than the K<25.3 galaxies, as measured by ALMA, which suggests their high
attenuation is related to their compact sizes. We find a correlation of dust
attenuation with star-formation rate surface density (Sigma_SFR), with the
K-faint submillimetre galaxies representing the higher-Sigma_SFR and highest-Av

likely to be associated with the formation of spheroids in compact galaxies at
high redshifts, but as a result of their high obscuration these are completely

an agent's uncertainty over the optimal policy, which can yield near-optimal
exploration strategies in tabular settings. However, in non-tabular settings
that involve function approximators, obtaining accurate uncertainty estimates
is almost as challenging a problem. In this paper, we highlight that value
estimates are easily biased and temporally inconsistent. In light of this, we
propose a novel method for estimating uncertainty over the value function that
relies on inducing a distribution over temporal difference errors. This
exploration signal controls for state-action transitions so as to isolate
uncertainty in value that is due to uncertainty over the agent's parameters.
Because our measure of uncertainty conditions on state-action transitions, we
cannot act on this measure directly. Instead, we incorporate it as an intrinsic
reward and treat exploration as a separate learning problem, induced by the
agent's temporal difference uncertainties. We introduce a distinct exploration
policy that learns to collect data with high estimated uncertainty, which gives
rise to a curriculum that smoothly changes throughout learning and vanishes in
the limit of perfect value estimates. We evaluate our method on hard
exploration tasks, including Deep Sea and Atari 2600 environments and find that
our proposed form of exploration facilitates both diverse and deep exploration.

forced imbibition in three-dimensional (3D) porous media with two parallel

number Ca, the wetting fluid preferentially invades the fine stratum, while for
Ca above a threshold value, the fluid instead preferentially invades the coarse
stratum. This threshold value depends on the medium geometry, the fluid
properties, and the presence of residual wetting films in the pore space. These

towards the Crab Nebula in emission and in absorption towards strong Galactic
background sources. Although these detections were limited to the first
quadrant of the Galaxy, the existing data suggest that ArH+ ubiquitously and
exclusively probes the diffuse atomic regions of the ISM. In this study, we
extend the coverage of ArH+ to other parts of the Galaxy with new observations
of its J = 1-0 transition along seven Galactic sight lines towards bright
sub-mm continuum sources. We aim to benchmark its efficiency as a tracer of
purely atomic gas by evaluating its correlation (or lack there of) with other
well-known atomic and molecular gas tracers. The observations of ArH+ near
617.5 GHz were made feasible with the new, sensitive SEPIA660 receiver on the
APEX 12 m telescope. The two sidebands of this receiver allowed us to observe
p-H2O+ transitions of at 607.227 GHz simultaneously with the ArH+ line. By
analysing the steady state chemistry of OH+ and o-H2O+, we derive on average a
cosmic-ray ionisation rate (CRIR), of 2.3e-16 s^-1 towards the sight lines
studied in this work. Using the derived values of the CRIR and the observed
ArH+ abundances we constrain the molecular fraction of the gas traced by ArH+
to lie below 2e-2 with a median value of 8.8e-4. Combined, our observations of
ArH+, OH+, H2O+, and CH probe different regimes of the ISM, from diffuse atomic
to diffuse and translucent molecular clouds. Over Galactic scales, we see that
the distribution of N(ArH+) is associated with that of N(H), particularly in
the inner Galaxy with potentially even contributions from the warm neutral
medium phase of atomic gas at larger galactocentric distances. We derive an
average o/p-ratio for H2O+ of 2.1, which corresponds to a nuclear spin
temperature of 41 K, consistent with the typical gas temperatures of diffuse

a combination of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations and empirical
models, we show that current galaxy-formation models do not produce enough star
formation in protoclusters to match observations. We find that the
star-formation rates (SFRs) predicted from the models are an order of magnitude
lower than what is seen in observations, despite the relatively good agreement
found for their mass-accretion histories, specifically that they lie on an
evolutionary path to become Coma-like clusters at $z\,{\simeq}\, 0$. Using a
well-studied protocluster core at $z\,{=}\,4.3$ as a test case, we find that
star-formation efficiency of protocluster galaxies is higher than predicted by
the models. We show that a large part of the discrepancy can be attributed to a
dependence of SFR on the numerical resolution of the simulations, with a
roughly factor of 3 drop in SFR when the spatial resolution decreases by a
factor of 4. We also present predictions up to $z\,{\simeq}\,7$. Compared to
lower redshifts, we find that centrals (the most massive member galaxies) are
more distinct from the other galaxies, while protocluster galaxies are less
distinct from field galaxies. All these results suggest that, as a rare and
extreme population at high-$z$, protoclusters can help constrain galaxy
formation models tuned to match the average population at $z\,{\simeq}\,0$.

on wave shape in shallow water through a wind-induced surface pressure for
different wind speeds and directions to provide the first theoretical
description of wind-induced shape changes. A multiple-scale analysis of long
waves propagating over a shallow, flat bottom and forced by a Jeffreys-type
surface pressure yields a forward or backward Korteweg-de Vries (KdV)-Burgers
equation for the wave profile, depending on the wind direction. The evolution
of a symmetric, solitary-wave initial condition is calculated numerically. The
resulting wave grows (decays) for onshore (offshore) wind and becomes
asymmetric, with the rear face showing the largest shape changes. The wave
profile's deviation from a reference solitary wave is primarily a bound wave
and trailing, dispersive, decaying tail. The onshore wind increases the wave's
energy and skewness with time while decreasing the wave's asymmetry, with the
opposite holding for offshore wind. The corresponding wind speeds are shown to
be physically realistic, and the shape changes are explained as slow growth
followed by rapid evolution according to the unforced KdV equation.

compressed sensing and approximation algorithms. We give the first
low-distortion embeddings for a wide class of nonlinear functions $f$. In
particular, we give additive $\epsilon$ error embeddings into $O(\frac{k\log
(n/\epsilon)}{\epsilon^2})$ dimensions for a class of nonlinearities that
includes the popular Sigmoid SoftPlus, and Gaussian functions. We strengthen
this result to give relative error embeddings under some further restrictions,
which are satisfied e.g., by the Tanh, SoftSign, Exponential Linear Unit, and
many other `soft' step functions and rectifying units. Understanding embeddings
for subspaces under nonlinear transformations is a key step towards extending
random sketching and compressing sensing techniques for linear problems to
nonlinear ones. We discuss example applications of our results to improved
bounds for compressed sensing via generative neural networks.

to search for cold kinematical substructures in the phase space of planetary
nebulae (PNe) and globular clusters (GCs) in the halo of massive galaxies and
intracluster regions. Aims: COSTA aims at detecting small sized, low velocity
dispersion streams, as the ones produced in recent interactions of dwarf
galaxies with the halo of more massive galaxies, including the ones sitting in
the central region of rich galaxy clusters. Methods: COSTA is based on a deep
friend-of-friend procedure that isolates groups of N particles with small
velocity dispersion (between 10 kms and $\sim$ 100 kms), using an iterative (n)
sigma-clipping over a defined number of (k) neighbor particles. The algorithm
has three parameters (k-n-N), plus a velocity dispersion cut-off, which defines
the ""coldness"" of the stream, that are set using Montecarlo realizations of the
sample under exam. Results: In this paper, we show the ability of COSTA to
recover simulated streams on mock data-sets of discrete kinematical tracers
with different sizes and measurement errors, from publicly available
hydrodynamical simulations. We also show the best algorithm set-up for a
realistic case of stream finding in the core of the Fornax cluster, for future
applications of COSTA to real populations of PNe and GCs. Conclusions: COSTA
can be generalized to all problems of finding small substructures in the phase
space of a limited sample of discrete tracers, provided that the algorithm is
trained on realistic mock observations reproducing the specific dataset under
exam.

times stronger than that predicted by traditional astrophysical models. If
genuine, a deeper absorption may lead to stronger fluctuations on the 21-cm
signal on degree scales (up to 1~Kelvin in rms), allowing these fluctuations to
be detectable in nearly 50~times shorter integration times compared to previous
predictions. We commenced the ""AARTFAAC Cosmic Explorer"" (ACE) program, that
employs the AARTFAAC wide-field imager, to measure or set limits on the power
spectrum of the 21-cm fluctuations in the redshift range $z = 17.9-18.6$
($\Delta\nu = 72.36-75.09$~MHz) corresponding to the deep part of the EDGES

23.5-23.75h and 23.5-23.75h, each with 2~h of data, recorded in `semi

pipeline (adapted from the LOFAR-EoR pipeline) on the AARTFAAC data. We observe
that noise estimates from the channel and time-differenced Stokes~$V$
visibilities agree with each other. After 2~h of integration and subtraction of

propose networks that are optimized to single-level (or single-objective);

optimal performance. Using multiple models to cover multiple levels involves
very high computational costs. To solve these problems, recent approaches train
networks on two different levels and propose their own interpolation methods to
enable arbitrary intermediate levels. However, many of them fail to generalize
or have certain side effects in practical usage. In this paper, we define these
frameworks as network tuning and interpolation and propose a novel module for
continuous-level learning, called Filter Transition Network (FTN). This module
is a structurally smoother module than existing ones. Therefore, the frameworks
with FTN generalize well across various tasks and networks and cause fewer
undesirable side effects. For stable learning of FTN, we additionally propose a
method to initialize non-linear neural network layers with identity mappings.
Extensive results for various image processing tasks indicate that the
performance of FTN is comparable in multiple continuous levels, and is
significantly smoother and lighter than that of other frameworks.

open clusters Praesepe (670 Myr), NGC 6811 (1 Gyr), and NGC 752 (1.4 Gyr)
demonstrate that, after converging onto a tight sequence of slowly rotating
stars in mass$-$period space, stars temporarily stop spinning down. These data
also show that the duration of this epoch of stalled spin-down increases toward
lower masses. To determine when stalled stars resume spinning down, we use data
from the $K2$ mission and the Palomar Transient Factory to measure
$P_\text{rot}$ for 58 dwarf members of the 2.7-Gyr-old cluster Ruprecht 147, 39
of which satisfy our criteria designed to remove short-period or
near-equal-mass binaries. Combined with the $Kepler$ $P_\text{rot}$ data for
the approximately coeval cluster NGC 6819 (30 stars with $M_\star > 0.85$
M$_\odot$), our new measurements more than double the number of $\approx$2.5
Gyr benchmark rotators and extend this sample down to $\approx$0.55 M$_\odot$.
The slowly rotating sequence for this joint sample appears relatively flat (22
$\pm$ 2 days) compared to sequences for younger clusters. This sequence also
intersects the $Kepler$ intermediate period gap, demonstrating that this gap
was not created by a lull in star formation. We calculate the time at which
stars resume spinning down, and find that 0.55 M$_\odot$ stars remain stalled
for at least 1.3 Gyr. To accurately age-date low-mass stars in the field,
gyrochronology formulae must be modified to account for this stalling
timescale. Empirically tuning a core$-$envelope coupling model with open
cluster data can account for most of the apparent stalling effect. However,
alternative explanations, e.g., a temporary reduction in the magnetic braking
torque, cannot yet be ruled out.

solving problems with complicated functional constraints. Existing works show
that FOMs for functional constrained problems have lower-order convergence
rates than those for unconstrained problems. In particular, an FOM for a smooth
strongly-convex problem can have linear convergence, while it can only converge
sublinearly for a constrained problem if the projection onto the constraint set
is prohibited. In this paper, we point out that the slower convergence is
caused by the large number of functional constraints but not the constraints
themselves. When there are only $m=O(1)$ functional constraints, we show that
an FOM can have almost the same convergence rate as that for solving an
unconstrained problem, even without the projection onto the feasible set. In
addition, given an $\varepsilon>0$, we show that a complexity result that is
better than a lower bound can be obtained, if there are only
$m=o(\varepsilon^{-\frac{1}{2}})$ functional constraints. Our result is
surprising but does not contradict to the existing lower complexity bound,
because we focus on a specific subclass of problems. Experimental results on
quadratically-constrained quadratic programs demonstrate our theory.

platforms for probing electron-electron interaction. Many key observations have
been made in these systems as sample quality improved over the years. Here, we
present a breakthrough in sample quality via source-material purification and
innovation in GaAs molecular beam epitaxy vacuum chamber design. Our samples
display an ultra-high mobility of $44\times10^6$ cm$^2$/Vs at an electron
density of $2.0\times10^{11}$ /cm$^2$. These results imply only 1 residual
impurity for every $10^{10}$ Ga/As atoms. The impact of such low impurity
concentration is manifold. Robust stripe/bubble phases are observed, and
several new fractional quantum Hall states emerge. Furthermore, the activation
gap of the $\nu=5/2$ state, which is widely believed to be non-Abelian and of
potential use for topological quantum computing, reaches $\Delta\simeq820$ mK.
We expect that our results will stimulate further research on
interaction-driven physics in a two-dimensional setting and significantly

that are approximate replicates of one another. In complex applications, or
automated data collection, these feature sets are not known a priori, and need
to be determined. This work proposes a class of latent factor models on the
observed high-dimensional random vector $X \in \mathbb{R}^p$, for defining,
identifying and estimating the index set of its approximately replicate
components. The model class is parametrized by a $p \times K$ loading matrix
$A$ that contains a hidden sub-matrix whose rows can be partitioned into groups
of parallel vectors. Under this model class, a set of approximate replicate
components of $X$ corresponds to a set of parallel rows in $A$: these entries
of $X$ are, up to scale and additive error, the same linear combination of the
$K$ latent factors; the value of $K$ is itself unknown. The problem of finding
approximate replicates in $X$ reduces to identifying, and estimating, the
location of the hidden sub-matrix within $A$, and of the partition of its row
index set $H$. Both $H$ and its partiton can be fully characterized in terms of
a new family of criteria based on the correlation matrix of $X$, and their
identifiability, as well as that of the unknown latent dimension $K$, are
obtained as consequences. The constructive nature of the identifiability
arguments enables computationally efficient procedures, with consistency
guarantees. When $A$ has the errors-in-variable parametrization, the difficulty
of the problem is elevated. The task becomes that of separating out groups of
parallel rows that are proportional to canonical basis vectors from other dense
parallel rows in $A$. This is met under a scale assumption, via a principled
way of selecting the target row indices, guided by the succesive maximization
of Schur complements of appropriate covariance matrices.

$Y$ to a set of potential explanatory variables $X = (X_1,\dots,X_p)$, and
start by trying to identify variables that contribute to this relationship. In
statistical terms, this goal can be posed as trying to identify $X_j$'s upon
which $Y$ is conditionally dependent. Sometimes it is of value to
simultaneously test for each $j$, which is more commonly known as variable
selection. The conditional randomization test (CRT) and model-X knockoffs are
two recently proposed methods that respectively perform conditional
independence testing and variable selection by, for each $X_j$, computing any
test statistic on the data and assessing that test statistic's significance by
comparing it to test statistics computed on synthetic variables generated using
knowledge of $X$'s distribution. Our main contribution is to analyze their
power in a high-dimensional linear model where the ratio of the dimension $p$
and the sample size $n$ converge to a positive constant. We give explicit
expressions of the asymptotic power of the CRT, variable selection with CRT
$p$-values, and model-X knockoffs, each with a test statistic based on either
the marginal covariance, the least squares coefficient, or the lasso. One
useful application of our analysis is the direct theoretical comparison of the
asymptotic powers of variable selection with CRT $p$-values and model-X
knockoffs; in the instances with independent covariates that we consider, the
CRT provably dominates knockoffs. We also analyze the power gain from using
unlabeled data in the CRT when limited knowledge of $X$'s distribution is
available, and the power of the CRT when samples are collected retrospectively.

pre-training paradigm on a massive knowledge-grounded text corpus crawled from

Under the fully-supervised setting, our model can achieve remarkable gains over

Employing this model, we show that vibronic coupling effects play a crucial

of the nonadiabatic interactions. In the limit of large nuclear to electronic

galaxy is believed to be warm-hot, with temperature around $10^6$K. The narrow
OVI absorption lines probe a somewhat cooler component at $\log \rm T(K)= 5.5$,
but broad OVI absorbers have the potential to probe the hotter CGM. Here we
present 376 ks Chandra LETG observations of a carefully selected galaxy in
which the presence of broad OVI together with the non-detection of Lya was
indicative of warm-hot gas. The strongest line expected to be present at
$\approx 10^6$K is OVII $\lambda 21.602$. There is a hint of an absorption line
at the redshifted wavelength, but the line is not detected with better than
$2\sigma$ significance. A physical model, taking into account strengths of
several other lines, provides better constraints. Our best-fit absorber model
has $\log \rm T(K) =6.3\pm 0.2$ and $\log \rm N_{H}
(cm^{-2})=20.7^{+0.3}_{-0.5}$. These parameters are consistent with the
warm-hot plasma model based on UV observations; other OVI models of cooler gas
phases are ruled out at better than $99$% confidence. Thus we have suggestive,
but not conclusive evidence for the broad OVI absorber probing the warm-hot gas
from the shallow observations of this pilot program. About 800ks of XMM-Newton
observations will detect the expected absorption lines of OVII and OVIII
unequivocally. Future missions like XRISM, Arcus and Athena will revolutionize
the CGM science.

text-based games, for example, descriptions like ""Good Job! You ate the food}""
indicate progress, and descriptions like ""You entered a new room"" indicate
exploration. Positive and negative cues like these can be converted to rewards
through sentiment analysis. This technique converts the sparse reward problem
into a dense one, which is easier to solve. Furthermore, this can enable
reinforcement learning without rewards, in which the agent learns entirely from

SeqMix, simply augments the queried samples by generating extra labeled
sequences in each iteration. The key difficulty is to generate plausible
sequences along with token-level labels. In SeqMix, we address this challenge
by performing mixup for both sequences and token-level labels of the queried
samples. Furthermore, we design a discriminator during sequence mixup, which
judges whether the generated sequences are plausible or not. Our experiments on
Named Entity Recognition and Event Detection tasks show that SeqMix can improve
the standard active sequence labeling method by $2.27\%$--$3.75\%$ in terms of
$F_1$ scores. The code and data for SeqMix can be found at

interchangeable. This equivalence holds across variations in architectures,
training datasets, and network tasks. Specifically, we mapped between 10
image-classification CNNs and between 4 facial-recognition CNNs. When image
embeddings generated by one CNN are transformed into embeddings corresponding
to the feature space of a second CNN trained on the same task, their respective
image classification or face verification performance is largely preserved. For
CNNs trained to the same classes and sharing a common backend-logit (soft-max)
architecture, a linear-mapping may always be calculated directly from the
backend layer weights. However, the case of a closed-set analysis with perfect
knowledge of classifiers is limiting. Therefore, empirical methods of
estimating mappings are presented for both the closed-set image classification
task and the open-set task of face recognition. The results presented expose
the essentially interchangeable nature of CNNs embeddings for two important and
common recognition tasks. The implications are far-reaching, suggesting an
underlying commonality between representations learned by networks designed and
trained for a common task. One practical implication is that face embeddings
from some commonly used CNNs can be compared using these mappings.

valve, and simulates its interaction with blood. As much as possible, the model
construction is based on first principles, but such that the model is
consistent with experimental observations. We require that tension in the
leaflets must support a pressure, then derive a system of partial differential
equations governing its mechanical equilibrium. The solution to these
differential equations is referred to as the predicted loaded configuration; it
includes the loaded leaflet geometry, fiber orientations and tensions needed to
support the prescribed load. From this configuration, we derive a reference
configuration and constitutive law. In fluid-structure interaction simulations
with the immersed boundary method, the model seals reliably under physiological
pressures, and opens freely over multiple cardiac cycles. Further, model
closure is robust to extreme hypo- and hypertensive pressures. Then, exploiting
the unique features of this model construction, we conduct experiments on
reference configurations, constitutive laws, and gross morphology. These
experiments suggest the following conclusions, which are directly applicable to
the design of prosthetic aortic valves. (i) The loaded geometry, tensions and
tangent moduli primarily determine model function. (ii) Alterations to the
reference configuration have little effect if the predicted loaded
configuration is identical. (iii) The leaflets must have sufficiently nonlinear
material response to function over a variety of pressures. (iv) Valve
performance is highly sensitive to free edge length and leaflet height. For
future use, our aortic valve modeling framework offers flexibility in
patient-specific models of cardiac flow.

noise will degrade the performance of the resulting deep neural network (DNN)
models. Much of the literature (with several recent exceptions) of learning
with noisy labels focuses on the case when the label noise is independent of
features. Practically, annotations errors tend to be instance-dependent and
often depend on the difficulty levels of recognizing a certain task. Applying
existing results from instance-independent settings would require a significant
amount of estimation of noise rates. Therefore, providing theoretically
rigorous solutions for learning with instance-dependent label noise remains a
challenge. In this paper, we propose CORES$^{2}$ (COnfidence REgularized Sample
Sieve), which progressively sieves out corrupted examples. The implementation
of CORES$^{2}$ does not require specifying noise rates and yet we are able to
provide theoretical guarantees of CORES$^{2}$ in filtering out the corrupted
examples. This high-quality sample sieve allows us to treat clean examples and
the corrupted ones separately in training a DNN solution, and such a separation
is shown to be advantageous in the instance-dependent noise setting. We
demonstrate the performance of CORES$^{2}$ on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets
with synthetic instance-dependent label noise and Clothing1M with real-world
human noise. As of independent interests, our sample sieve provides a generic
machinery for anatomizing noisy datasets and provides a flexible interface for
various robust training techniques to further improve the performance. Code is

neural network, if initialized properly, can be trained to reach comparable or
even better performance to that of the original network. Prior works in lottery
tickets have primarily focused on the supervised learning setup, with several
papers proposing effective ways of finding ""winning tickets"" in classification
problems. In this paper, we confirm the existence of winning tickets in deep
generative models such as GANs and VAEs. We show that the popular iterative
magnitude pruning approach (with late rewinding) can be used with generative
losses to find the winning tickets. This approach effectively yields tickets
with sparsity up to 99% for AutoEncoders, 93% for VAEs and 89% for GANs on
CIFAR and Celeb-A datasets. We also demonstrate the transferability of winning
tickets across different generative models (GANs and VAEs) sharing the same
architecture, suggesting that winning tickets have inductive biases that could
help train a wide range of deep generative models. Furthermore, we show the
practical benefits of lottery tickets in generative models by detecting tickets
at very early stages in training called ""early-bird tickets"". Through
early-bird tickets, we can achieve up to 88% reduction in floating-point
operations (FLOPs) and 54% reduction in training time, making it possible to
train large-scale generative models over tight resource constraints. These
results out-perform existing early pruning methods like SNIP (Lee, Ajanthan,

Velocity profiles of selected PACS lines correlate well with known

obtain the energy and momentum transfer excitation spectrum (the energy-loss

electron attachment, DEA), strongly correlated with cellular death, which are
scored in sensitive volumes having the size of two DNA convolutions. The sizes
of clusters of damaging events for a wide range of carbon ion energies, from
those relevant to hadrontherapy up to cosmic radiation, predict with
unprecedented statistical accuracy the nature and relative magnitude of the
main inelastic processes contributing to radiation biodamage, confirming that
ionization accounts for the vast majority of complex damage. DEA, typically
regarded as a very relevant biodamage mechanism, surprisingly plays a minor
role in carbon-ion induced clusters of harmful events.

We improve detection performance by dynamically allocating a lower sampling

than baseline across areas with objects of interest. We automate the sampling
rate allocation using linear programming and show significant time savings
while reducing the radar block size by a factor of 2. We also analyze a Binary

homogenization results lose their validity at the onset of 1st bifurcation,
which can be computed from multiscale stability analysis. The multiscale
instabilities include: a) microscale structural instability which is calculated
by Bloch wave analysis; and b) macroscale material instability which is
calculated by rank-1 convexity checks on the homogenized tangent moduli.
Details on the implementation of the Bloch wave analysis are provided,
including the selection of the wave vector space and the retrieval of the
real-valued buckling mode from the complex-valued Bloch wave. Three methods are
detailed for solving the resulted constrained eigenvalue problem - two
condensation methods and a null-space based projection method. Both
implementations of the homogenization and stability analyses are validated
using numerical examples including hyperelastic and elastoplastic
metamaterials. Various microscale buckling phenomena are also demonstrated by
examining several representative metamaterial examples. Aligned with
theoretical results, the numerical results show that the microscopic long

capable of recovering a broader range of word types. Existing systems rely on
global visual features that represent the entire image, but localizing the
relevant regions of the image will make it possible to recover a larger set of
words, such as adjectives and verbs. In this paper, we propose a model that
uses finer-grained visual information from different parts of the image, using
automatic object proposals. In experiments on the Flickr8K Audio Captions
Corpus, we find that our model improves over approaches that use global visual
features, that the proposals enable the model to recover entities and other
related words, such as adjectives, and that improvements are due to the model's
ability to localize the correct proposals.

increase the rate of discovery of CSAM and help thousands of victims. We
propose a framework for training and evaluating deployment-ready machine

evaluate CSAM detection models against intelligent adversaries and models'

the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment, have the potential to provide unique
sensitivity to low-energy (few to tens of MeV) electron neutrinos produced by
core-collapse supernovae. Despite their importance for neutrino energy
reconstruction, nuclear de-excitations following charged-current $\nu_e$
absorption on $^{40}$Ar have never been studied in detail at supernova
energies.
  Purpose: I develop a model of nuclear de-excitations that occur following the
$^{40}\mathrm{Ar}(\nu_e,e^{-})^{40}\mathrm{K}^*$ reaction. This model is
applied to the calculation of exclusive cross sections.
  Methods: A simple expression for the inclusive differential cross section is
derived under the allowed approximation. Nuclear de-excitations are described
using a combination of measured $\gamma$-ray decay schemes and the
Hauser-Feshbach statistical model. All calculations are carried out using a
novel Monte Carlo event generator called MARLEY (Model of Argon Reaction Low
Energy Yields).
  Results: Various total and differential cross sections are presented. Two
de-excitation modes, one involving only $\gamma$-rays and the other including
single neutron emission, are found to be dominant at few tens-of-MeV energies.
  Conclusions: Nuclear de-excitations have a strong impact on the achievable
energy resolution for supernova $\nu_e$ detection in liquid argon. Tagging
events involving neutron emission, though difficult, could substantially
improve energy reconstruction. Given a suitable calculation of the inclusive
cross section, the MARLEY nuclear de-excitation model may readily be applied to
other scattering processes.

that, instead, our goal should be to put city planning in the hands of the
people, and to that end, give ordinary residents pattern-based planning tools
to help them redesign (and repair) their urban surrounds. Through this,
residents can explore many disparate ideas, try them, and, if successful,
replicate them, enabling bottom-up city planning through direct action. We
describe a prototype for such a tool that leverages classic patterns to enable
city planning by residents, using case studies from Los Angeles as guides for
both the problem and potential solution.

$2_{12}-1_{11}$ line toward a sample of 100 high-mass starless clump candidates
(SCCs) by using the Korean VLBI Network (KVN) 21-m radio telescopes. The
detection rates of the SiO J=1-0, 2-1, 3-2 lines and the H$_2$CO line are
$31.0\%$, $31.0\%$, $19.5\%$ and $93.0\%$, respectively. Shocks seem to be
common in this stage of massive star formation. The widths of the observed SiO
lines (full width at zero power (FWZP)) range from 3.4 to 55.1 km s$^{-1}$. A
significant fraction ($\sim29\%$) of the detected SiO spectra have broad line
widths (FWZP $>20~km~s^{-1}$), which are very likely associated with fast
shocks driven by protostellar outflows. This result suggests that about one
third of the SiO-detected SCCs are not really starless but protostellar. On the
other hand, about 40$\%$ of the detected SiO spectra show narrow line widths
(FWZP<10 $km~s^{-1}$) probably associated with low-velocity shocks which are
not necessarily protostellar in origin. The estimated SiO column densities are
mostly $0.31-4.32\times10^{12}~cm^{-2}$. Comparing the SiO column densities
derived from SiO J=1-0 and 2-1 lines, we suggest that the SiO molecules in the
SCCs may be in the non-LTE condition. The SiO abundances to H$_2$ are usually
$0.20-10.92\times10^{-10}$.

To further investigate the spectroscopic variations, we conducted a

the absorption profiles changed as V960 Mon faded. The line profile of
absorption lines such as Fe I and Ca I can be explained by a sum of the spectra
of the disk atmosphere and the central star. The model spectrum created to
explain the variations of the line profiles suggests that the effective
temperature of the central star is $\sim$5500 K, which is comparable to that of
the pre-outburst phase with a distance of 1.6 kpc with Gaia. The spectrum also
shows that the effective temperature of the disk atmosphere decreased as V960

establishing local and uniform continuity bounds for Schur concave functions.
Our technique uses a particular relationship between majorization and the trace
distance between quantum states. Namely, the majorization pre-order attains a
minimum over $\epsilon$-balls in this distance. By tracing the path of the
majorization-minimizer as a function of the distance $\epsilon$, we obtain the
path of ""majorization flow"". This yields a new proof of the Audenaert-Fannes
continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy in a universal framework which
extends to the other functions, including the $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropy, for
which we obtain novel bounds in the case $\alpha > 1$. We apply this technique
to other Schur concave functions, such as the number of connected components of
a certain random graph model, and the number of distinct realizations of a
random variable.
  In the second part, we consider repeated interaction systems, in which a
system of interest interacts with a sequence of probes one at a time. We
characterize which repeated interaction systems break any initially-present
entanglement between the system and an untouched reference after finitely many
steps. Additionally, when the probes and their interactions with the system are
slowly-varying (i.e. adiabatic), we analyze the saturation of Landauer's bound,
an inequality between the entropy change of the system and the energy change of
the probes, in the limit in which the number of steps tends to infinity and
both the difference between consecutive probes and the difference between their
interactions vanishes. This analysis proceeds at a fine-grained level by means
of a two-time measurement protocol, in which the energy of the probes is
measured before and after each interaction.

with public communications. We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting
protocol with ballot secrecy, fairness (no tally information is available
before the polls close), and dispute-freeness (voters can observe that all
voters correctly followed the protocol).
  BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic encryption system in
which each candidate is associated with a masked unique prime. Each voter
engages in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter
selects the index of a prime associated with a candidate and receives the
selected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by encrypting
their masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. The distributor does not
learn the voter's choice, and no one learns the mapping between primes and
candidates until the audit phase. By hiding the mapping between primes and
candidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information to carry out
effective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any
partial tally---until everyone has voted. Multiplying all votes, their
decryption shares, and the unmasking factor yields a product of the primes each
raised to the number of votes received.
  In contrast to some existing boardroom voting protocols, BVOT does not rely
on any zero-knowledge proof; instead, it uses oblivious transfer to assure
ballot secrecy and correct vote casting. Also, BVOT can handle multiple
candidates in one election. BVOT prevents cheating by hiding crucial
information: an attempt to increase the tally of one candidate might increase
the tally of another candidate. After all votes are cast, any party can tally

Gaussian processes have many useful theoretical properties and have proven
practically useful, they suffer from poor scaling in the number of

Gaussian process models make them generally unsuitable for application to
streaming data. We propose an algorithm for sequentially partitioning the input
space and fitting a localized Gaussian process to each disjoint region. The
algorithm is shown to have superior time and space complexity to existing
methods, and its sequential nature permits application to streaming data. The
algorithm constructs a model for which the time complexity of updating is
tightly bounded above by a pre-specified parameter. To the best of our
knowledge, the model is the first local Gaussian process regression model to
achieve linear memory complexity. Theoretical continuity properties of the

data, their performance can suffer when applied to higher dimensional data,
owing presumably to the curse of dimensionality. One technique for avoiding
this is to assume no dependence between features and that the data are sampled
from a separable density. This allows one to estimate each marginal
distribution independently thereby avoiding the slow rates associated with
estimating the full joint density. This is a strategy employed in naive Bayes
models and is analogous to estimating a rank-one tensor. In this paper we
investigate whether these improvements can be extended to other simplified
dependence assumptions which we model via nonnegative tensor decompositions. In
our central theoretical results we prove that restricting estimation to
low-rank nonnegative PARAFAC or Tucker decompositions removes the
dimensionality exponent on bin width rates for multidimensional histograms.
These results are validated experimentally with high statistical significance
via direct application of existing nonnegative tensor factorization to
histogram estimators.

resonances are formulated and their applications to first-order resonances are
discussed. For the $k_p$:$k$ resonance, the usual critical argument $\varphi =
k \lambda - k_p \lambda_p + (k_p - k) \varpi$ is taken as the resonant angle in
the first model, while the second model is characterized by a new critical
argument $\sigma = \varphi / k_p$. Based on canonical transformations, the
resonant Hamiltonians associated with these two models are formulated. It is
found that the second Hamiltonian model holds two advantages in comparison to
the first model: (a) providing a direct correspondence between phase portraits
and Poincar\'e sections, and (b) presenting new phase-phase structures where
the zero-eccentricity point is a visible saddle point. Then, the second
Hamiltonian model is applied to the first-order inner and outer resonances,
including the 2:1, 3:2, 4:3, 2:3 and 3:4 resonances. The phase-space structures
of these first-order resonances are discussed in detail and then the libration
centers and associated resonant widths are identified analytically. Simulation
results show that there are pericentric and apocentric libration zones where
the libration centers diverge away from the nominal resonance location as the
eccentricity approaches zero and, in particular, the resonance separatrices do
not vanish at arbitrary eccentricities for both the inner and outer

such as MSDNets or Shallow-Deep Networks. These architectures enable faster
inferences and could bring DNNs to low-power devices, e.g., in the Internet of
Things (IoT). However, it is unknown if the computational savings provided by
this approach are robust against adversarial pressure. In particular, an
adversary may aim to slowdown adaptive DNNs by increasing their average
inference time$-$a threat analogous to the $denial$-$of$-$service$ attacks from
the Internet. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of this threat
by experimenting with three generic multi-exit DNNs (based on VGG16, MobileNet,
and ResNet56) and a custom multi-exit architecture, on two popular image
classification benchmarks (CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet). To this end, we show
that adversarial example-crafting techniques can be modified to cause slowdown,
and we propose a metric for comparing their impact on different architectures.
We show that a slowdown attack reduces the efficacy of multi-exit DNNs by
90-100%, and it amplifies the latency by 1.5-5$\times$ in a typical IoT
deployment. We also show that it is possible to craft universal, reusable
perturbations and that the attack can be effective in realistic black-box
scenarios, where the attacker has limited knowledge about the victim. Finally,
we show that adversarial training provides limited protection against
slowdowns. These results suggest that further research is needed for defending
multi-exit architectures against this emerging threat. Our code is available at

appears diminished or absent in other species is that it requires accurate but
specialized forms of social learning at which humans are uniquely adept. Here,
we develop a Bayesian model to contrast the evolution of high-fidelity social

individual learning are inexpensive, (3) traits are complex, (4) individual

flexible. Low-fidelity transmission differs in many respects. It not only
evolves when (2) individual learning is costly and (4) infrequent but also
proves more robust when (3) traits are simple and (5) adaptive problems are
easy. If conditions favouring the evolution of high-fidelity transmission are
stricter (3 and 5) or harder to meet (2 and 4), this could explain why social

velocities (RVs) for both components were measured, and the effective
temperature and projected rotational velocity of the primary star were
determined to be $T_{\rm eff,1}$ = 8,820 $\pm$ 62 K and $v_1 \sin i_{1}$ = 90
$\pm$ 18 km s$^{-1}$, respectively, by comparing the observed spectrum with the
Kurucz models. The accurate fundamental parameters of AO Ser were determined by
a simultaneous analysis of the light and RV curves. The masses and radii of the
primary and secondary components are $M_1$ = 2.55 $\pm$ 0.09 M$_\odot$ and
$R_1$ = 1.64 $\pm$ 0.02 R$_\odot$ and $M_2$ = 0.49 $\pm$ 0.02 M$_\odot$ and
$R_2$ = 1.38 $\pm$ 0.02 R$_\odot$, respectively. Multiple frequency analyses
for the eclipse-subtracted light residuals were conducted. As a result, we
detected two frequencies of $f_1$ = 21.852 days$^{-1}$ and $f_2$ = 23.484
days$^{-1}$. The evolutionary position on the HR diagram and the pulsational
characteristics indicate that the primary star is a $\delta$ Sct pulsator with
a radial fundamental mode. On the other hand, the relatively evolved secondary
is oversized for its own mass.

exponential speedup over the classical computers. The speedup advantage is more
significant when the size and the frequency of solving the power flow problem
become more substantial. Verified quantum computing applications to power
systems are merely nonexistent at this point. Through this paper, we plan to
(1) provide a proof-of-concept that practical power system problems can be
solved using quantum technology, (2) build a quantum-grid foundation by solving
a fundamental power system problem with applications in many other critical
grid problems, and (3) apply HHL to solve an SLE which has broad applications
in many power system problems. A small 3-bus system is used for testing and

linear measurements of the signal, which are represented as separate bitplanes.
Each bitplane is coded using a distributed source code of the appropriate rate,
and transmitted. The decoder, starts from the least significant biplane and,
using a prediction of the signal as side information, iteratively recovers each
bitplane based on the source prediction and the signal, assuming all the
previous bitplanes of lower significance have already been recovered. We
provide theoretical results guiding the rate selection, relying only on the
least squares prediction error of the source. This is in contrast to existing
approaches which rely on difficult-to-estimate information-theoretic metrics to
set the rate. We validate our approach using simulations on remote-sensing
multispectral images, comparing them with existing approaches of similar

radius $R_n$ as well as the matter radius $R_m$.
  The chiral (Kyushu) $g$-matrix folding model for $^{12}$C scattering on
$^{9}$Be, $^{12}$C, $^{27}$Al targets was tested in the incident energy range
of $30 \lsim E_{\rm in} \lsim 400 $ MeV, and it is found that the model
reliably reproduces the $\sigma_R$ in $30 \lsim E_{\rm in} \lsim 100 $ MeV and
$250 \lsim E_{\rm in} \lsim 400$ MeV. \item[Aim]
  We determine $R_n$ and the neutron skin thickness $R_{\rm skin}$ of
${}^{208}{\rm Pb}$ by using high-quality $\sigma_R$ data for the
$p+{}^{208}{\rm Pb}$ scattering in $30 \leq E_{\rm in} \leq 100$ MeV.
  The theoretical model is the Kyushu $g$-matrix folding model with the
densities calculated with Gongny-D1S HFB (GHFB) with the angular momentum
projection (AMP). \item[Results]
  The Kyushu $g$-matrix folding model with the GHFB+AMP densities
underestimates $\sigma_{\rm R}$ in $30 \leq E_{\rm in} \leq 100$~MeV only by a
factor of 0.97.
  Since the proton radius $R_p$ calculated with GHFB+AMP agrees with the
precise experimental data of 5.444 fm, the small deviation of the theoretical
result from the data on $\sigma_R$ allows us to scale the GHFB+AMP neutron
density so as to reproduce the $\sigma_R$ data.
  In $E_{\rm in}$ = 30--100 MeV, the experimental $\sigma_R$ data can be
reproduced by assuming the neutron radius of ${}^{208}{\rm Pb}$ as $R_n$ =
$5.722 \pm 0.035$ fm. \item[Conclusion]
  The present result $R_{\rm skin}$ = $0.278 \pm 0.035$ fm is in good agreement
with the recent PREX-II result of $r_{\rm skin}$ = $0.283\pm 0.071$ fm.

trained by an end-to-end mechanism and competent for employing the low-level
and mid-level cues (i.e., the discriminative image structure) to understand
images, but lacks the high-level inference ability. By contrast, human beings
have an excellent inference capacity and can be able to reliably interpret the
RS imagery only when human beings master the basic RS domain knowledge. In
literature, ontological modeling and reasoning is an ideal way to imitate and
employ the domain knowledge of human beings, but is still rarely explored and
adopted in the RS domain. To remedy the aforementioned critical limitation of
DSSN, this paper proposes a collaboratively boosting framework (CBF) to combine

investigate the impact of rotation on shock dynamics, black hole formation, and
gravitational wave signals. The rapidly-rotating model undergoes an early
explosion at $\sim 250$~ms postbounce and shows signs of the low $T/|W|$
instability. We do not find black hole formation in this model within $\sim
460$~ms postbounce. In contrast, we find black hole formation at
776~ms~postbounce and 936~ms~postbounce for the non-rotating and
slowly-rotating models, respectively. The slowly-rotating model explodes at
$\sim 650$~ms postbounce, and the subsequent fallback accretion onto the
proto-neutron star (PNS) results in BH formation. In addition, the
standing~accretion~shock~instability induces rotation of the proto-neutron star
in the model that started with a non-rotating progenitor. Assuming conservation
of specific angular momentum during black hole formation, this corresponds to a
black~hole spin parameter of $a=J/M=0.046$. However, if no explosion sets in,
all the angular momentum will eventually be accreted by the BH, resulting in a
non-spinning BH. The successful explosion of the slowly-rotating model
drastically slows down the accretion onto the PNS, allowing continued cooling
and contraction that results in an extremely high gravitational-wave frequency
($f\sim3000$~Hz) at black~hole formation, while the non-rotating model
generates gravitational wave signals similar to our corresponding 2D
simulations.

phenomena in solids and their technological applications. In semiconductors,
these phenomena have been so far studied in relatively weak electron-electron
interaction regimes, where the single electron picture holds. However, SOC can
profoundly compete against Coulomb interaction, which could lead to the
emergence of unconventional electronic phases. Since SOC depends on the
electric field in the crystal including contributions of itinerant electrons,
electron-electron interactions can modify this coupling. Here we demonstrate
the emergence of SOC effect in a high-mobility two-dimensional electron system
in a simple band structure MgZnO/ZnO semiconductor. This electron system
features also strong electron-electron interaction effects. By changing the
carrier density with Mg-content, we tune the SOC strength and achieve its
interplay with electron-electron interaction. These systems pave a way to
emergent spintronic phenomena in strong electron correlation regime and to the
formation of novel quasiparticles with the electron spin strongly coupled to
the density.

reflectionless excitation of arbitrary finite photonic structures in any
dimension. It describes the necessary and sufficient conditions for perfectly
reflectionless excitation to be possible, and specifies how many physical
parameters must be tuned to achieve this. In the absence of geometric
symmetries the tuning of at least one structural parameter will be necessary to
achieve reflectionless excitation. The theory employs a recently identified set
of complex-frequency solutions of the Maxwell equations as a starting point,
which are defined by having zero reflection into a chosen set of input
channels, and which are referred to as R-zeros. Tuning is generically necessary
in order to move an R-zero to the real-frequency axis, where it becomes a
physical steady-state solution, referred to as a Reflectionless Scattering Mode
(RSM). Except in single-channel systems, the RSM corresponds to a particular
input wavefront, and any other wavefront will generally not be reflectionless.
In a structure with parity and time-reversal symmmetry or with parity-time
symmetry, generically a subset of R-zeros is real, and reflectionless states
exist without structural tuning. Such systems can exhibit symmetry-breaking
transitions when two RSMs meet, which corresponds to a recently identified kind
of exceptional point at which the shape of the reflection and transmission
resonance lineshape is flattened.

initialization via TT-SVD (Oseledets, 2011) and new iterative backward/forward
updates. We develop the general upper bound on estimation error for TTOI with
the support of several new representation lemmas on tensor matricizations. By
developing a matching information-theoretic lower bound, we also prove that
TTOI achieves the minimax optimality under the spiked tensor model. The merits
of the proposed TTOI are illustrated through applications to estimation and
dimension reduction of high-order Markov processes, numerical studies, and a
real data example on New York City taxi travel records. The software of the
proposed algorithm is available online$^6$.

polynomial action operator. With this approach, we can analyse such processes
on general state spaces, going far beyond Banach spaces. Moreover, we can be
very flexible in the definition of what ""polynomial"" means. We show that
""polynomial process"" universally means ""affine drift"". Simple assumptions on
the polynomial action operators lead to stronger characterisations on the
polynomial class of processes.
  In our framework we do not need to specify polynomials explicitly but can
work with a general sequence of graded vector spaces of functions on the state
space. Elements of these graded vector spaces form the monomials by introducing
a sequence of vector space complements. The basic tool of our analysis is the
polynomial action operator, which is a semigroup of operators mapping
conditional expected values of monomials acting on the polynomial process to
monomials of the same or lower grade. Unlike the classical Euclidean case, the
polynomial action operator may not form a finite-dimensional subspace after a
finite iteration, a property we call locally finite. We study abstract
polynomial processes under both algebraic and topological assumptions on the
polynomial actions, and establish an affine drift structure. Moreover, we
characterize the covariance structure under similar but slightly stronger
conditions. A crucial part in our analysis is the use of the (algebraic or
topological) dual of the monomials of grade one, which serves as a
linearization of the state space of the polynomial process. Our general
framework covers polynomial processes with values in Banach spaces recently
studied by Cuchiero and Svaluto-Ferro.

Recently, deep learning methods have achieved impressive performance for
dynamic scene deblurring. However, the motion information contained in a blurry
image has yet to be fully explored and accurately formulated because: (i) the
ground truth of dynamic motion is difficult to obtain; (ii) the temporal
ordering is destroyed during the exposure; and (iii) the motion estimation from
a blurry image is highly ill-posed. By revisiting the principle of camera
exposure, motion blur can be described by the relative motions of sharp content
with respect to each exposed position. In this paper, we define exposure
trajectories, which represent the motion information contained in a blurry
image and explain the causes of motion blur. A novel motion offset estimation
framework is proposed to model pixel-wise displacements of the latent sharp
image at multiple timepoints. Under mild constraints, our method can recover
dense, (non-)linear exposure trajectories, which significantly reduce temporal
disorder and ill-posed problems. Finally, experiments demonstrate that the
recovered exposure trajectories not only capture accurate and interpretable
motion information from a blurry image, but also benefit motion-aware image
deblurring and warping-based video extraction tasks. Codes are available on

(repeatedly) use local imbalance criteria to transfer loads concurrently across
the participants of the system, iterating until all loads are balanced. Our
algorithms are based on a short local deal-agreement communication of
proposal/deal, based on the neighborhood loads. They converge monotonically,
always providing a better state as the execution progresses. Besides, our
algorithms avoid making loads temporarily negative. Thus, they may be
considered anytime ones, in the sense that they can be stopped at any time
during the execution. We show that our synchronous load balancing algorithms
achieve $\epsilon$-Balanced state for the continuous setting and 1-Balanced
state for the discrete setting in all graphs, within $O(n D \log(n
K/\epsilon))$ and $O(n D \log(n K/D) + n D^2)$ time, respectively, where $n$ is
the number of nodes, $K$ is the initial discrepancy, $D$ is the graph diameter,
and $\epsilon$ is the final discrepancy. Our other monotonic synchronous and
asynchronous algorithms for the discrete setting are generalizations of the
first presented algorithms, where load balancing is performed concurrently with
more than one neighbor. These algorithms arrive at a 1-Balanced state in time
$O(n K^2)$ in general graphs, but have a potential to be faster as the loads
are balanced among all neighbors, rather than with only one; we describe a
scenario that demonstrates the potential for a fast ($O(1)$) convergence. Our
asynchronous algorithm avoids the need to wait for the slowest participants'

such networks by pruning therefore becomes highly desirable. However, pruning
3D CNNs is largely unexplored possibly because of the complex nature of typical
pruning algorithms that embeds pruning into an iterative optimization paradigm.
In this work, we introduce a Resource Aware Neuron Pruning (RANP) algorithm
that prunes 3D CNNs at initialization to high sparsity levels. Specifically,
the core idea is to obtain an importance score for each neuron based on their
sensitivity to the loss function. This neuron importance is then reweighted
according to the neuron resource consumption related to FLOPs or memory. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our pruning method on 3D semantic segmentation
with widely used 3D-UNets on ShapeNet and BraTS'18 as well as on video
classification with MobileNetV2 and I3D on UCF101 dataset. In these
experiments, our RANP leads to roughly 50-95 reduction in FLOPs and 35-80
reduction in memory with negligible loss in accuracy compared to the unpruned
networks. This significantly reduces the computational resources required to
train 3D CNNs. The pruned network obtained by our algorithm can also be easily
scaled up and transferred to another dataset for training.

radiation, normal tissue can be irradiated unnecessarily, leading to
experimental uncertainties. Recognition of this need led us to develop
quantitative bioluminescence tomography (QBLT), which provides strong imaging
contrast to localize optical targets. We demonstrated its capability of guiding
conformal RT using an orthotopic bioluminescent glioblastoma (GBM) model. With
multi-projection and multi-spectral bioluminescence imaging and a novel
spectral derivative method, our QBLT system is able to reconstruct GBM with
localization accuracy <1mm. An optimal threshold was determined to delineate
QBLT reconstructed gross target volume (GTV_{QBLT}), which provides the best
overlap between the GTV_{QBLT} and CBCT contrast labeled GBM (GTV), used as the
ground truth for the GBM volume. To account for the uncertainty of QBLT in
target localization and volume delineation, we also innovated a margin design;
a 0.5mm margin was determined and added to GTV_{QBLT} to form a planning target
volume (PTV_{QBLT}), which largely improved tumor coverage from 75% (0mm
margin) to 98% and the corresponding variation (n=10) of the tumor coverage was
significantly reduced. Moreover, with prescribed dose 5Gy covering 95% of
PTV_{QBLT}, QBLT-guided 7-field conformal RT can irradiate 99.4 \pm 1.0% of GTV

assumes that the feasible region of the optimization problem is nonempty.
However, there are many important practical optimization problems whose
feasible regions are not known to be nonempty or not, and optimizers of the
objective function with the least constraint violation prefer to be found. A
natural way for dealing with these problems is to extend the constrained
optimization problem as the one optimizing the objective function over the set
of points with the least constraint violation. Firstly, the minimization
problem with least constraint violation is proved to be an Lipschitz equality
constrained optimization problem when the original problem is a convex
optimization problem with possible inconsistent conic constraints, and it can
be reformulated as an MPEC problem. Secondly, for nonlinear programming
problems with possible inconsistent constraints, various types of stationary
points are presented for the MPCC problem which is equivalent to the
minimization problem with least constraint violation, and an elegant necessary
optimality condition, named as L-stationary condition, is established from the
classical optimality theory of Lipschitz continuous optimization. Finally, the
smoothing Fischer-Burmeister function method for nonlinear programming case is
constructed for solving the problem minimizing the objective function with the
least constraint violation. It is demonstrated that, when the positive
smoothing parameter approaches to zero, any point in the outer limit of the
KKT-point mapping is an L-stationary point of the equivalent MPCC problem.

study the complex structures and dynamics of solar coronal magnetic fields. The
model is configured with typical coronal environment of tenuous gas governed by
strong magnetic field, and thus its lower boundary is set at the base of the
corona, but driven by magnetic fields observed in the photosphere. A previous
assessment of the model using data from a flux emergence simulation (FES)
showed that the DARE failed to reproduce the coronal magnetic field in the FES,
which is attributed to the fact that the photospheric data in the FES has a
very strong Lorentz force and therefore spurious flows are generated in the
DARE model. Here we further test the DARE by using three sets of data from the
FES sliced at incremental heights, which correspond to the photosphere, the
chromosphere and the base of the corona. It is found that the key difference in
the three sets of data is the extent of the Lorentz force, which makes the
data-driven model perform very differently. At the two higher levels above the
photosphere, the Lorentz force decreases substantially, and the DARE model
attains results in much better agreement with the FES, confirming that the
Lorentz force in the boundary data is a key issue affecting the results of the
DARE model. However, unlike the FES data, the photospheric field from SDO/HMI
observations has recently been found to be very close to force-free. Therefore,
we suggest that it is still reasonable to use the photospheric magnetic field
as approximation of the field at the coronal base to drive the DARE model.

they often fail to continuously learn new tasks without forgetting previous
ones as they are re-trained throughout their lifetime, a challenge known as
lifelong learning. State-of-the-art lifelong language learning methods store
past examples in episodic memory and replay them at both training and inference
time. However, as we show later in our experiments, there are three significant
impediments: (1) needing unrealistically large memory module to achieve good
performance, (2) suffering from negative transfer, (3) requiring multiple local
adaptation steps for each test example that significantly slows down the
inference speed. In this paper, we identify three common principles of lifelong
learning methods and propose an efficient meta-lifelong framework that combines
them in a synergistic fashion. To achieve sample efficiency, our method trains
the model in a manner that it learns a better initialization for local
adaptation. Extensive experiments on text classification and question answering
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by achieving
state-of-the-art performance using merely 1% memory size and narrowing the gap

infinitesimal step size) on linear neural network training. We propose a tensor
formulation of neural networks that includes fully-connected, diagonal, and
convolutional networks as special cases, and investigate the linear version of
the formulation called linear tensor networks. With this formulation, we can
characterize the convergence direction of the network parameters as singular
vectors of a tensor defined by the network. For $L$-layer linear tensor
networks that are orthogonally decomposable, we show that gradient flow on
separable classification finds a stationary point of the $\ell_{2/L}$
max-margin problem in a ""transformed"" input space defined by the network. For
underdetermined regression, we prove that gradient flow finds a global minimum
which minimizes a norm-like function that interpolates between weighted
$\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ norms in the transformed input space. Our theorems
subsume existing results in the literature while removing standard convergence
assumptions. We also provide experiments that corroborate our analysis.

a small set of up to $d$ defectives from a large population of $n$ items with

In the literature, $d$-disjunct matrices ($d$-DM) and $\bar{d}$-separable

studied for several decades. It is well-known that a $d$-DM provides a more
efficient identifying algorithm than a $\bar{d}$-SM, while a $\bar{d}$-SM could

important role in transfer learning when distribution of the testing data is
shifted from the training data. Importance weighting, as a natural and
principle strategy to adjust for covariate shift, has been commonly used in the
field of transfer learning. However, this strategy is not robust to model
misspecification or excessive estimation error. In this paper, we propose an
augmented transfer regression learning (ATReL) approach that introduces an
imputation model for the targeted response, and uses it to augment the
importance weighting equation. With novel semi-non-parametric constructions and
calibrated moment estimating equations for the two nuisance models, our ATReL
method is less prone to (i) the curse of dimensionality compared to
nonparametric approaches, and (ii) model mis-specification than parametric
approaches. We show that our ATReL estimator is root-n-consistent when at least
one nuisance model is correctly specified, estimation for the parametric part
of the nuisance models achieves parametric rate, and the nonparametric
components are rate doubly robust. Simulation studies demonstrate that our
method is more robust and efficient than existing parametric and fully
nonparametric (machine learning) estimators under various configurations. We
also examine the utility of our method through a real example about transfer
learning of phenotyping algorithm for rheumatoid arthritis across different
time windows. Finally, we propose ways to enhance the intrinsic efficiency of
our estimator and to incorporate modern machine learning methods with our

exact diagonalization based on the Kambe's method, which employs a local
conservation of composite spins formed by spin-1 entities located in opposite
corners of a diamond spin cluster. It is shown that the spin-1 Heisenberg
diamond cluster exhibits several intriguing quantum ground states, which are
manifested in low-temperature magnetization curves as intermediate plateaus at
1/4, 1/2 and 3/4 of the saturation magnetization. Besides, the spin-1
Heisenberg diamond cluster may also exhibit an enhanced magnetocaloric effect,
which may be relevant for a low-temperature refrigeration achieved through the
adiabatic demagnetization. It is evidenced that the spin-1 Heisenberg diamond
cluster with the antiferromagnetic coupling constants J1/kB = 41.4 K and J2/kB
= 9.2 K satisfactorily reproduces a low-temperature magnetization curve
recorded for the tetranuclear nickel complex [Ni4(CO3)2(aetpy)8](ClO4)4 (aetpy

detected at 1/2 and 3/4 of the saturation magnetization. A microscopic nature
of fractional magnetization plateaus observed experimentally is clarified and
interpreted in terms of valence-bond crystal with either a single or double
valence bond. It is suggested that this frustrated magnetic molecule can
provide a prospective cryogenic coolant with the maximal isothermal entropy

We do not expect to be able to afford the overhead required for quantum error
correction in the next decade, so in the meantime we must rely on low-cost,
unscalable error mitigation techniques to bring quantum computing to its full
potential. This paper presents a new error mitigation technique based on
quantum phase estimation that can also reduce errors in expectation value
estimation (e.g., for variational algorithms). The general idea is to apply
phase estimation while effectively post-selecting for the system register to be
in the starting state, which allows us to catch and discard errors which knock
us away from there. We refer to this technique as ""verified phase estimation""
(VPE) and show that it can be adapted to function without the use of control
qubits in order to simplify the control circuitry for near-term
implementations. Using VPE, we demonstrate the estimation of expectation values
on numerical simulations of intermediate scale quantum circuits with multiple
orders of magnitude improvement over unmitigated estimation at near-term error
rates (even after accounting for the additional complexity of phase
estimation). Our numerical results suggest that VPE can mitigate against any
single errors that might occur; i.e., the error in the estimated expectation
values often scale as O(p^2), where p is the probability of an error occurring
at any point in the circuit. This property, combined with robustness to
sampling noise reveal VPE as a practical technique for mitigating errors in
near-term quantum experiments.

Si atoms, when placed close enough on Si (111) and (100) surfaces, but not on
the (110) surface. The presence of a Si (111) surface shifts the Fermi level of
graphene into its conduction band, resulting in an increase of the work
function by 0.29 eV and of the electron density by three orders of magnitude.
The carrier density of graphene can also be increased by eighty times on a Si
(100) substrate without doping, due to the modification of the density of
states near the Dirac point. No interfacial covalent bond can be formed on Si
(110). These striking effects that different orientations of a silicon

density of the silicon surface. Applying the results to a real device of a

to magnitude 20.7 in the visible. In addition to the millions of stars,
thousands of Solar System Objects (SSOs) are observed daily. By comparing their
positions to those of known objects, a daily processing pipeline filters known
objects from potential discoveries. However, owing to Gaia's specific scanning
law designed for stars, potential newly discovered moving objects are
characterized by very few observations, acquired over a limited time. This
aspect was recognized early in the design of the Gaia data processing. A daily
processing pipeline dedicated to these candidate discoveries was set up to
release calls for observations to a network of ground-based telescopes. Their
aim is to acquire follow-up astrometry and to characterize these objects. From
the astrometry measured by Gaia, preliminary orbital solutions are determined,
allowing to predict the position of these potentially new discovered objects in
the sky accounting for the large parallax between Gaia and the Earth (separated
by 0.01 au). A specific task within the Gaia Consortium has been responsible
for the distribution of requests for follow-up observations of potential Gaia
SSO discoveries. Since late 2016, these calls for observations (called alerts)
are published daily via a Web interface, freely available to anyone world-wide.
Between November 2016 and July 2020, over 1700 alerts have been published,
leading to the successful recovery of more than 200 objects. Among those, six
have provisional designation assigned with the Gaia observations, the others
being previously known objects with poorly characterized orbits, precluding
identification at the time of Gaia observations. There is a clear trend for
objects with a high inclination to be unidentified, revealing a clear bias in
the current census of SSOs against high inclination populations.

small logits by addition of a common activation function, e.g., hyperbolic

findings, we develop the new bounded function. The addition of our function
improves adversarial robustness because it makes logit and pre-logit vectors

documents in a target language by leveraging labeled documents from other
languages. Existing approaches for transferring supervision across languages
require expensive cross-lingual resources, such as parallel corpora, while less
expensive cross-lingual representation learning approaches train classifiers
without target labeled documents. In this work, we propose a cross-lingual
teacher-student method, CLTS, that generates ""weak"" supervision in the target
language using minimal cross-lingual resources, in the form of a small number
of word translations. Given a limited translation budget, CLTS extracts and
transfers only the most important task-specific seed words across languages and
initializes a teacher classifier based on the translated seed words. Then, CLTS
iteratively trains a more powerful student that also exploits the context of
the seed words in unlabeled target documents and outperforms the teacher. CLTS
is simple and surprisingly effective in 18 diverse languages: by transferring
just 20 seed words, even a bag-of-words logistic regression student outperforms
state-of-the-art cross-lingual methods (e.g., based on multilingual BERT).
Moreover, CLTS can accommodate any type of student classifier: leveraging a
monolingual BERT student leads to further improvements and outperforms even
more expensive approaches by up to 12% in accuracy. Finally, CLTS addresses
emerging tasks in low-resource languages using just a small number of word
translations.

to generate statements that hold either in high-probability, or in-expectation,

prediction. However, the memory and computation costs of kernel approximation
models are still too high if we want to deploy them on memory-limited devices

challenge, we propose a novel memory and computation-efficient kernel SVM model
by using both binary embedding and binary model coefficients. First, we propose
an efficient way to generate compact binary embedding of the data, preserving
the kernel similarity. Second, we propose a simple but effective algorithm to
learn a linear classification model with ternary coefficients that can support
different types of loss function and regularizer. Our algorithm can achieve
better generalization accuracy than existing works on learning binary
coefficients since we allow coefficient to be $-1$, $0$, or $1$ during the
training stage, and coefficient $0$ can be removed during model inference for
binary classification. Moreover, we provide a detailed analysis of the
convergence of our algorithm and the inference complexity of our model. The
analysis shows that the convergence to a local optimum is guaranteed, and the
inference complexity of our model is much lower than other competing methods.
Our experimental results on five large real-world datasets have demonstrated
that our proposed method can build accurate nonlinear SVM models with memory

Kolmogorov/Kraichnan power law in the inertial range, followed by a break
around the characteristic ion scales. This frequency range is characterized by
strong intermittent activity, with the presence of non-compressive coherent
structures, such as current sheets and vortex-like structures, and wave
packets, identified as ion cyclotron modes. Although, all these intermittent

that RW with random step size or uniformly shrinking step size is exactly the

RW with geometric shrinking step size, such that the size of the $n$th step is

random numbers for RW of $t=N$ which are then arranged in a descending order so
that the size of the $n$th step is $\lambda_n^n$. We have shown, both

problem-specific dataset, then building a model to fit this dataset. To build
the ultimate artificial intelligence, we desire a single machine that can
handle diverse new problems, for which task-specific annotations are limited.
We bring up textual entailment as a unified solver for such NLP problems.
However, current research of textual entailment has not spilled much ink on the
following questions: (i) How well does a pretrained textual entailment system
generalize across domains with only a handful of domain-specific examples? and
(ii) When is it worth transforming an NLP task into textual entailment? We
argue that the transforming is unnecessary if we can obtain rich annotations
for this task. Textual entailment really matters particularly when the target
NLP task has insufficient annotations.
  Universal NLP can be probably achieved through different routines. In this
work, we introduce Universal Few-shot textual Entailment (UFO-Entail). We
demonstrate that this framework enables a pretrained entailment model to work
well on new entailment domains in a few-shot setting, and show its

amorphous solids under arbitrary time-dependent perturbations, building on the
work of Lin and Wyart [Phys. Rev. X 6, 011005 (2016)] for steady shear. Local
stresses are driven by power-law distributed mechanical noise from yield events
throughout the material, in contrast to the well-studied H\'{e}braud-Lequeux
model where the noise is Gaussian. We first use a mapping to a mean first
passage time problem to study the phase diagram in the absence of shear, which
shows a transition between an arrested and a fluid state. We then introduce a
boundary layer scaling technique for low yield rate regimes, which we first
apply to study the scaling of the steady state yield rate on approaching the
arrest transition. These scalings are further developed to study the aging
behaviour in the glassy regime, for different values of the exponent $\mu$
characterizing the mechanical noise spectrum. We find that the yield rate
decays as a power-law for $1<\mu<2$, a stretched exponential for $\mu=1$ and an
exponential for $\mu<1$, reflecting the relative importance of far-field and
near-field events as the range of the stress propagator is varied. Comparison
of the mean-field predictions with aging simulations of a lattice elastoplastic
model shows excellent quantitative agreement, up to a simple rescaling of time.

submitted to biomedical journals, international (co-)authorship of these papers

journal metrics and said changes. We study these possible changes using two
approaches: a short-term analysis through which changes during the first six
months of the outbreak are examined for both COVID-19 related papers and
non-COVID-19 related papers; and a longitudinal approach through which changes
are examined in comparison to the previous four years. Our results show that
the pandemic has so far had a tremendous effect on all examined accounts of
scholarly publications: A sharp increase in publication volume has been
witnessed and it can be almost entirely attributed to the pandemic; a
significantly faster mean time to acceptance for COVID-19 papers is apparent,
and it has (partially) come at the expense of non-COVID-19 papers; and a
significant reduction in international collaboration for COVID-19 papers has
also been identified. As the pandemic continues to spread, these changes may
cause a slow down in research in non-COVID-19 biomedical fields and bring about
a lower rate of international collaboration.

technique has recently been introduced by which the electron distribution in
orbitals of molecules adsorbed at surfaces can be imaged in momentum space.
This has even been used for the identification of reaction intermediates in
surface reactions. However, so far it has been impossible to follow an
orbital's momentum-space dynamics in time, for example through an excitation
process or a chemical reaction. Here, we report a key step in this direction:
we combine time-resolved photoemission employing high laser harmonics and a
recently developed momentum microscope to establish a tomographic, femtosecond
pump-probe experiment of unoccupied molecular orbitals. Specifically, we
measure the full momentum-space distribution of transiently excited electrons.
Because in molecules this momentum-space distribution is closely linked to
orbital shapes, our experiment offers the extraordinary possibility to observe
ultrafast electron motion in time and space. This enables us to connect their
excited states dynamics to specific real-space excitation pathways.

applications like question answering. The path-based reasoning models can
leverage much information over paths other than pure triples in the KG, which
face several challenges: all the existing path-based methods are data-driven,
lacking explainability for path representation. Besides, some methods either
consider only relational paths or ignore the heterogeneity between entities and
relations both contained in paths, which cannot capture the rich semantics of
paths well. To address the above challenges, in this work, we propose a novel
joint semantics and data-driven path representation that balances
explainability and generalization in the framework of KG embedding. More
specifically, we inject horn rules to obtain the condensed paths by the
transparent and explainable path composition procedure. The entity converter is
designed to transform the entities along paths into the representations in the
semantic level similar to relations for reducing the heterogeneity between
entities and relations, in which the KGs both with and without type information
are considered. Our proposed model is evaluated on two classes of tasks: link
prediction and path query answering task. The experimental results show that it
has a significant performance gain over several different state-of-the-art
baselines.

because their velocity distribution sets the growth rate to larger bodies. When
planetesimals form in protoplanetary discs, their orbits are nearly circular
and planar due to the effect of gas drag. However, mutual close encounters of
the planetesimals increase eccentricities and inclinations until an equilibrium
between stirring and damping is reached. After disc dissipation, there is no
more gas drag and mutual close encounters as well as encounters with planets
stir the orbits again. The high number of planetesimals in protoplanetary discs
renders it difficult to simulate their dynamics by means of direct N-body
simulations of planet formation. Therefore, we developed a novel method for the
dynamical evolution of planetesimals that is based on following close
encounters between planetesimal-mass bodies and gravitational stirring by
planet-mass bodies. To separate the orbital motion from the close encounters,
we employ a Hamiltonian splitting scheme as used in symplectic N-body
integrators. Close encounters are identified using a cell algorithm with linear
scaling in the number of bodies. A grouping algorithm is used to create small
groups of interacting bodies which are integrated separately. Our method allows
simulating a high number of planetesimals interacting through gravity and
collisions with low computational cost. The typical computational time is of
the order of minutes or hours, up to a few days for more complex simulations,
as compared to several hours or even weeks for the same setup with full N-body.
The dynamical evolution of the bodies is sufficiently well reproduced. This
will make it possible to study the growth of planetesimals through collisions
and pebble accretion coupled to their dynamics for a much higher number of
bodies than previously accessible with full N-body simulations.

bound is determined by the spectrum estimation method with a small number of

verify our theory with a four-qubit optical quantum system.We experimentally

and for a few studies based on longitudinal (or panel) data the focus has been
on the conditional mean. While the former, by construction, cannot model the
dependencies between observations across time, the latter cannot look at the
relationship between food expenditure and covariates (such as income,
education, etc.) at lower (or upper) quantiles, which are of interest to
policymakers. This paper analyzes expenditures on total food (TF), food at home
(FAH), and food away from home (FAFH) using mean regression and quantile
regression models for longitudinal data to examine the impact of economic
recession and various demographic, socioeconomic, and geographic factors. The
data is taken from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) and comprises of
2174 families in the United States (US) observed between 2001-2015. Results
indicate that age and education of the head, family income, female headed
family, marital status, and economic recession are important determinants for
all three types of food expenditure. Spouse education, family size, and some
regional indicators are important for expenditures on TF and FAH, but not for
FAFH. Quantile analysis reveals considerable heterogeneity in the covariate
effects for all types of food expenditure, which cannot be captured by models
focused on conditional mean. The study ends by showing that modeling
conditional dependence between observations across time for the same family
unit is crucial to reducing/avoiding heterogeneity bias and better model
fitting.

integral part of the NLP pipeline. At the same time, probing has emerged as a
way to investigate the linguistic knowledge captured by pre-trained models.
Very little is, however, understood about how fine-tuning affects the
representations of pre-trained models and thereby the linguistic knowledge they
encode. This paper contributes towards closing this gap. We study three
different pre-trained models: BERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT, and investigate
through sentence-level probing how fine-tuning affects their representations.
We find that for some probing tasks fine-tuning leads to substantial changes in
accuracy, possibly suggesting that fine-tuning introduces or even removes
linguistic knowledge from a pre-trained model. These changes, however, vary
greatly across different models, fine-tuning and probing tasks. Our analysis
reveals that while fine-tuning indeed changes the representations of a
pre-trained model and these changes are typically larger for higher layers,
only in very few cases, fine-tuning has a positive effect on probing accuracy
that is larger than just using the pre-trained model with a strong pooling
method. Based on our findings, we argue that both positive and negative effects
of fine-tuning on probing require a careful interpretation.

differently sharp martensitic transitions after ideal and non-ideal annealing.
We develop alloy design rules for tuning the magnetostructural phase transition
and evaluate specifically the sensitivity of the transition temperature towards
the externally applied magnetic fields ($\frac{dT_t}{\mu_0dH}$) by analyzing
the different stoichiometries. We then set up a phase diagram including
martensitic transition temperatures and austenite Curie temperatures depending
on the e/a ratio for varying Co and Ti content. The evolution of the Curie
temperature with changing stoichiometry is compared to other Heusler systems.

their size which has an adverse effect on their inference time and memory
requirements. Deep CNNs can either be pruned width-wise by removing filters

wise pruning (filter pruning) is commonly performed via learnable gates or
switches and sparsity regularizers whereas pruning of layers has so far been
performed arbitrarily by manually designing a smaller network usually referred

perform both width-wise as well as depth-wise pruning. This is achieved by
introducing gates at different granularities (neuron, filter, layer, block)
which are then controlled via an objective function that simultaneously
performs pruning at different granularity during each forward pass. Our
approach is applicable to wide-variety of architectures without any constraints
on spatial dimensions or connection type (sequential, residual, parallel or

operationalizing such inputs in a production setting that is scalable is not

ESQ can be used to predict the future scoring potential of a student as well as
offer personalized learning nudges, both critical to improving LOs. Multiple
machine learning models are evaluated for the prediction task. In order to
provide meaningful feedback to the learner, individualized Shapley feature
attributions for each feature are computed. Prediction intervals are obtained
by applying non-parametric quantile regression, in an attempt to quantify the
uncertainty in the predictions. We apply the above modelling strategy on a

sequential steps: \textit{i}) estimating blur kernel from given low-resolution
(LR) image and \textit{ii}) restoring SR image based on estimated kernel. This
two-step solution involves two independently trained models, which may not be
well compatible with each other. Small estimation error of the first step could
cause severe performance drop of the second one. While on the other hand, the
first step can only utilize limited information from LR image, which makes it
difficult to predict highly accurate blur kernel. Towards these issues, instead
of considering these two steps separately, we adopt an alternating optimization
algorithm, which can estimate blur kernel and restore SR image in a single
model. Specifically, we design two convolutional neural modules, namely
\textit{Restorer} and \textit{Estimator}. \textit{Restorer} restores SR image
based on predicted kernel, and \textit{Estimator} estimates blur kernel with
the help of restored SR image. We alternate these two modules repeatedly and
unfold this process to form an end-to-end trainable network. In this way,
\textit{Estimator} utilizes information from both LR and SR images, which makes
the estimation of blur kernel easier. More importantly, \textit{Restorer} is
trained with the kernel estimated by \textit{Estimator}, instead of
ground-truth kernel, thus \textit{Restorer} could be more tolerant to the
estimation error of \textit{Estimator}. Extensive experiments on synthetic
datasets and real-world images show that our model can largely outperform
state-of-the-art methods and produce more visually favorable results at much
higher speed. The source code is available at

architecture by introducing a bottleneck in the second layer can yield changes
in learned function. To understand this relationship fully requires a way of
quantitatively comparing trained networks. The fields of electrophysiology and
psychophysics have developed a wealth of methods for characterising visual
systems which permit such comparisons. Inspired by these methods, we propose an
approach to obtaining spatial and colour tuning curves for convolutional
neurons, which can be used to classify cells in terms of their spatial and
colour opponency. We perform these classifications for a range of CNNs with
different depths and bottleneck widths. Our key finding is that networks with a
bottleneck show a strong functional organisation: almost all cells in the
bottleneck layer become both spatially and colour opponent, cells in the layer
following the bottleneck become non-opponent. The colour tuning data can
further be used to form a rich understanding of how colour is encoded by a
network. As a concrete demonstration, we show that shallower networks without a
bottleneck learn a complex non-linear colour system, whereas deeper networks
with tight bottlenecks learn a simple channel opponent code in the bottleneck
layer. We further develop a method of obtaining a hue sensitivity curve for a
trained CNN which enables high level insights that complement the low level
findings from the colour tuning data. We go on to train a series of networks
under different conditions to ascertain the robustness of the discussed
results. Ultimately, our methods and findings coalesce with prior art,
strengthening our ability to interpret trained CNNs and furthering our

ingredient of this new formulation is to use a structural causal model (SCM) as
the prior distribution for a bidirectional generative model. The prior is then
trained jointly with a generator and an encoder using a suitable GAN algorithm
incorporated with supervised information on the ground-truth factors and their
underlying causal structure. We provide theoretical justification on the

symmetric stress $\bm{\sigma}=-\nabla^{2}u$ is sought in the Sobolev space
$H({\rm{div}}\bm{div},\Omega;\mathbb{S})$ simultaneously with the displacement
$u$ in $L^{2}(\Omega)$. Stemming from the structure of
$H(\bm{div},\Omega;\mathbb{S})$ conforming elements for the linear elasticity
problems proposed by J. Hu and S. Zhang, the

constructed by imposing the normal continuity of $\bm{div}\bm{\sigma}$ on the
$H(\bm{div},\Omega;\mathbb{S})$ conforming spaces of $P_{k}$ symmetric tensors.
The inheritance makes the basis functions easy to compute. The discrete spaces
for $u$ are composed of the piecewise $P_{k-2}$ polynomials without requiring
any continuity. Such mixed finite elements are inf-sup stable on both
triangular and tetrahedral grids for $k\geq 3$, and the optimal order of
convergence is achieved. Besides, the superconvergence and the postprocessing

to the complex physical and chemical properties of the leaf surfaces. However,
for certain leaf surfaces for which the evaporation process appears to follow
the standard constant-contact-radius or constant-contact-angle modes, it should
be possible to mimic the droplet evaporation with both a well-chosen synthetic
surface and a relatively simple mathematical model.
  Experiments: Surfactant droplet evaporation experiments were performed on two
commercial crop species, wheat and capsicum, along with two synthetic surfaces,
up to a $90\,^{\circ}$ incline. The time-dependence of the droplets' contact
angles, height, volume and contact radius was measured throughout the
evaporation experiments. Mathematical models were developed to simulate the
experiments.
  Findings: With one clear exception, for all combinations of surfaces,
surfactant concentrations and angles, the experiments appear to follow the
standard evaporation modes and are well described by the mathematical models
(modified Popov and Young-Laplace-Popov). The exception is wheat with a high
surfactant concentration, for which droplet evaporation appears nonstandard and
deviates from the diffusion limited models, perhaps due to additional
mechanisms such as the adsorption of surfactant, stomatal density or an
elongated shape in the direction of the grooves in the wheat surface.

types of cancer and significantly extends patients life. The intensity of the
TTFields within the tumor was associated with the treatment outcomes: the
larger the intensity the longer the patients are likely to survive. Therefore,
it was suggested to optimize TTFields transducer array location such that their
intensity is maximized. Such optimization requires multiple computations of
TTFields in a simulation framework. However, these computations are typically
performed using finite element methods or similar approaches that are time
consuming. Therefore, only a limited number of transducer array locations can
be examined in practice. To overcome this issue, we have developed a method for
fast estimation of TTFields intensity. We have designed and implemented a
method that inputs a segmentation of the patients head, a table of tissues
electrical properties and the location of the transducer array. The method
outputs a spatial estimation of the TTFields intensity by incorporating a few
relevant parameters in a random-forest regressor. The method was evaluated on
10 patients (20 TA layouts) in a leave-one-out framework. The computation time
was 1.5 minutes using the suggested method, and 180-240 minutes using the
commercial simulation. The average error was 0.14 V/cm (SD = 0.06 V/cm) in
comparison to the result of the commercial simulation. These results suggest
that a fast estimation of TTFields based on a few parameters is feasible. The
presented method may facilitate treatment optimization and further extend

generalized framework for the application of DNN-MRFT to higher-order systems.
One of the notable advantages of DNN-MRFT is the exact estimation of identified

describing function method in approximating the response of Lure's systems. A
secondary contribution is a generalized controller based on DNN-MRFT that
takes-off a UAV with unknown dynamics and identifies the inner loops dynamics
in-flight. Using the developed framework, DNN-MRFT is sequentially applied to
the outer translational loops of the UAV utilizing in-flight results obtained
for the inner attitude loops. DNN-MRFT takes on average 15 seconds to get the
full knowledge of multirotor UAV dynamics and without any further tuning or
calibration the UAV would be able to pass through a vertical window, and
accurately follow trajectories achieving state-of-the-art performance. Such

language generators frequently leads to low-quality results. Rather, most
state-of-the-art results on language generation tasks are attained using beam
search despite its overwhelmingly high search error rate. This implies that the
MAP objective alone does not express the properties we desire in text, which
merits the question: if beam search is the answer, what was the question? We
frame beam search as the exact solution to a different decoding objective in
order to gain insights into why high probability under a model alone may not
indicate adequacy. We find that beam search enforces uniform information
density in text, a property motivated by cognitive science. We suggest a set of
decoding objectives that explicitly enforce this property and find that exact
decoding with these objectives alleviates the problems encountered when
decoding poorly calibrated language generation models. Additionally, we analyze
the text produced using various decoding strategies and see that, in our neural
machine translation experiments, the extent to which this property is adhered
to strongly correlates with BLEU.

subproblems which can be enforced to be strongly convex and which therefore
admit a unique solution. The resulting steps are shown to be equivalent to
inexact proximal point iterations on the extended-real-valued cost function,
which allows for a fairly simple analysis where convergence to a stationary
point at an \(R\)-linear rate is shown. The QPALM algorithm solves the
subproblems iteratively using semismooth Newton directions and an exact
linesearch. The former can be computed efficiently in most iterations by making
use of suitable factorization update routines, while the latter requires the
zero of a monotone, one-dimensional, piecewise affine function. QPALM is
implemented in open-source C code, with tailored linear algebra routines for
the factorization in a self-written package LADEL. The resulting implementation
is shown to be extremely robust in numerical simulations, solving all of the
Maros-Meszaros problems and finding a stationary point for most of the
nonconvex QPs in the Cutest test set. Furthermore, it is shown to be
competitive against state-of-the-art convex QP solvers in typical QPs arising
from application domains such as portfolio optimization and model predictive
control. As such, QPALM strikes a unique balance between solving both easy and

post-processed hydrodynamical simulations of a turbulent isothermal molecular

characteristic width of $\,\sim\!0.1 \, {\rm pc}$, both on maps of their true
surface density, and on maps of their $850 \, {\rm \mu m}$ dust-continuum
emission, in agreement with previous work. On maps of line emission from CO
isotopologues, the apparent widths of filaments are typically several times
larger because the line intensities are poorly correlated with the surface
density. On maps of line emission from dense-gas tracers such as N$_2$H$^+$ and
HCN, the apparent widths of filaments are $\lesssim 0.1 \, {\rm pc}$. Thus,
current observations of molecular-line emission are compatible with the
universal $0.1 \, {\rm pc}$ filament width inferred from ${\it Herschel}$
observations, provided proper account is taken of abundance, optical-depth, and
excitation considerations. We find evidence for $\sim 0.4 \, {\rm km \,

differences might be a useful indicator of the mechanism by which a filament

sentences as bags, words as instances, and the words indicating an aspect
category as the key instances of the aspect category. Given a sentence and the
aspect categories mentioned in the sentence, AC-MIMLLN first predicts the
sentiments of the instances, then finds the key instances for the aspect
categories, finally obtains the sentiments of the sentence toward the aspect

exchange behavior. Analyzing the mechanisms governing exchange of resources
constitutes the foundation of several social-science perspectives. Neoclassical
economics provides one of the most well-known perspectives of how rational
individuals allocate and exchange resources. Using Rational Choice Theory
(RCT), neoclassical economics assumes that exchange between two individuals
will occur when resources are scarce and that these individuals interact
rationally to satisfy their requirements (i.e., preferences). While RCT is
useful to characterize interaction in closed and stylized systems, it proves
insufficient to capture social and psychological reality where culture,
emotions, and habits play an integral part in resource exchange. Social
Resource Theory (SRT) improves on RCT in several respects by making the social
nature of resources the object of study. SRT shows how human interaction is
driven by an array of psychological mechanisms, from emotions to heuristics.
Thus, SRT provides a more realistic foundation for analyzing and explaining
social exchange than the stylized instrumental rationality of RCT. Yet SRT has
no clear place for events of abundance and sufficiency as additional
motivations to exchange resources. This article synthesize and formalize a
foundation for SRT using not only scarcity but also abundance and sufficiency.

vertical velocities and spatial distributions of inertial particles settling in
a wall-bounded turbulent flow. The theory is based on the exact phase-space
equation for the Probability Density Function describing particle positions and
velocities. This allowed us to identify the distinct physical mechanisms
governing the particle transport. We then examined the asymptotic behavior of
the particle motion near the wall, revealing the fundamental differences to the
near wall behavior that is produced when incorporating gravitational settling.
When the average vertical particle mass flux is zero, the averaged vertical
particle velocity is zero away from the wall due to the particles
preferentially sampling regions where the fluid velocity is positive, which
balances with the downward Stokes settling velocity. When the average mass flux
is negative, the combined effects of turbulence and particle inertia lead to
average vertical particle velocities that can significantly exceed the Stokes
settling velocity, by as much as ten times. Sufficiently far from the wall, the
enhanced vertical velocities are due to the preferential sweeping mechanism.
However, as the particles approach the wall, the contribution from the
preferential sweeping mechanism becomes small, and a downward contribution from
the turbophoretic velocity dominates the behavior. Close to the wall, the
particle concentration grows as a power-law, but the nature of this power law
depends on the particle Stokes number. Finally, our results highlight how the
Rouse model of particle concentration is to be modified for particles with
finite inertia.

true causal models, structures learned even from zero- and first-order

typically quite complex -- owing to the combination of their large spatial
extension and the so-called {\it curse of dimensionality}. Often, such systems
are studied on truncated numerical domains -- at the cost of losing
information. Here we present methods for calculating differential probabilities
for unbound particles which are subjected to a {\it complex absorbing
potential}. In addition to attenuating outgoing waves, this absorber is also
used to probe them by projection onto single-particle scattering states, thus
rendering the calculation of multi-particle scattering states superfluous.
Within formalism based on the Lindblad equation, singly differential spectra
from subsequent absorptions are obtained by resolving the dynamics of the
remaining particles after the first absorption. While the framework generalizes
naturally to any number of particles, explicit, compact and intuitive
expressions for the differential probability distributions are derived for the
two-particle case. The applicability of the method is illustrated by numerical
examples involving two-particle model-systems. These examples, which address
scattering and photo ionization, demonstrate how energy distributions of
unbound particles may be determined on numerical domains considerably smaller
than the actual extension of the system.

rapid increase in CME velocity just after eruption in the inner corona. This
phase is followed by a non-significant residual acceleration (deceleration)
characterized by an almost constant speed of CMEs. We demonstrate that the
initial acceleration is in the range 0.24-2616 ms-2 with median (average) value
of 57 ms-2 (34 ms-2 ) and it takes place up to a distance of about 28 solar

Additionally, the initial acceleration is significant in the case of fast CMEs
(V > 900 kms-1 ), where the median (average) values are about 295 ms-2 (251
ms-2 ), respectively, and much weaker in the case of slow CMEs (V < 250 kms-1
), where the median (average) values are about 18 ms-2 (17 ms-2 ),
respectively. We note that the significant driving force (Lorentz force) can
operate up to a distance of 6 solar radius from the Sun during the first 2
hours of propagation. We found a significant anti-correlation between the
initial acceleration magnitude and the acceleration duration, whereas the
residual acceleration covers a range from -1224 to 0 ms-2 with a median

feature only up to 4.0 deg from the centre of the SMC due to the limited
spatial coverage of the data and hence could not find a physical connection
with the MB. To determine the spatial extent and properties of this foreground
population, we analysed data from the Gaia data release 2 (DR2) of a ~ 314 sq.
deg region centred on the SMC, which cover the entire SMC and a significant
portion of the MB. We find that the foreground population is present only

towards the MB and hence does not fully overlap with the MB in the plane of the

from the stellar population of the main body with ~ 35 km/s slower tangential
velocity and moving to the North-West relative to the main body. Though the
observed properties are not fully consistent with the simulations, a comparison
indicates that the foreground stellar structure is most likely a tidally
stripped counterpart of the gaseous MB and might have formed from the inner

  Process","27 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper we present the distribution of the maximum of the asymmetric
telegraph process in an arbitrary time interval $[0,t]$ under the conditions
that the initial velocity $V(0)$ is either $c_1$ or $-c_2$ and the number of
changes of direction is odd or even. For the case $V(0) = -c_2$ the singular
component of the distribution of the maximum displays an unexpected cyclic
behavior and depends only on $c_1$ and $c_2$, but not on the current time $t$.
We obtain also the unconditional distribution of the maximum for either $V(0) =
c_1$ or $V(0) = -c_2$ and its expression has the form of series of Bessel
functions. We also show that all the conditional distributions emerging in this
analysis are governed by generalized Euler-Poisson-Darboux equations. We
recover all the distributions of the maximum of the symmetric telegraph process
as particular cases of the present paper. We underline that it rarely happens
to obtain explicitly the distribution of the maximum of a process. For this
reason the results on the range of oscillations of a natural process like the
telegraph model make it useful for many applications.

on-demand by switching external parameters is of great interest for basic
research and applications. An emerging group of smart stabilizers are
microgels, which are nano- and micro-sized, three-dimensional polymer networks
that are swollen by a good solvent. In the last decades, the influence of
various external stimuli on the two-dimensional phase behavior of microgels at
air- and oil-water interfaces has been studied. However, the impact of the
top-phase itself has been barely considered. Here, we present data that
directly address the influence of the top-phase on the microgel properties at
interfaces. The dimensions of pNIPAM microgels are measured after deposition
from two interfaces, i.e., air- and decane-water. While the total in-plane size
of the microgel increases with increasing interfacial tension, the portions or
fractions of the microgels situated in the aqueous phase are not affected. We
correlate the area microgels occupy to the surface tensions of the interfaces,
which allows to estimate an elastic modulus. In comparison to nanoindentation
measurements, we observe a larger elastic modulus for the microgels. By
combining compression, deposition, and visualization, we show that the
two-dimensional phase behavior of the microgel monolayers is not altered,
although the microgels have a larger total in-plane size at higher interfacial
tension. A peer reviewed and extended version of this preprint and the

by defect spectroscopic techniques, specifically capacitance-voltage and
thermal admittance spectroscopy. Using these methods, the (0/-) charge

local sensors first collaborate (via a collaboration matrix) with each other.
Then a subset of sensors selected to communicate with the FC linearly compress
their observations before transmission. We design near-optimal collaboration
and linear compression strategies under power constraints via alternating
minimization of the sequential minimum mean square error. We show that the
objective function for collaboration design can be non-convex depending on the
network topology. We reformulate and solve the collaboration design problem
using quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP). Moreover, the
compression design problem is also formulated as a QCQP. We propose two
versions of compression design, one centralized where the compression
strategies are derived at the FC and the other decentralized, where the local
sensors compute their individual compression matrices independently. It is
noted that the design of decentralized compression strategy is a non-convex
problem. We obtain a near-optimal solution by using the bisection method. In
contrast to the one-shot estimator, our proposed algorithm is capable of
handling dynamic system parameters such as channel gains and energy
constraints. Importantly, we show that the proposed methods can also be used
for estimating time-varying random vector parameters. Finally, numerical
results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

assume that the entanglement is dominantly carried by spinon excitations
traveling at different velocities, and the entropy profile is reproduced by a
probabilistic expression involving the density fraction of the spinons reaching
the subsystem. The ansatz works well in the gapless phase for moderate values
of the XXZ anisotropy, eventually deteriorating as other types of quasiparticle
excitations gain spectral weight. Furthermore, if the initial state is excited
by a local Majorana fermion, we observe a nontrivial rescaling of the entropy
profiles. This effect is further investigated in a conformal field theory

training data. But far away from them, ReLU Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) can
still underestimate uncertainty and thus be asymptotically overconfident. This
issue arises since the output variance of a BNN with finitely many features is
quadratic in the distance from the data region. Meanwhile, Bayesian linear
models with ReLU features converge, in the infinite-width limit, to a
particular Gaussian process (GP) with a variance that grows cubically so that
no asymptotic overconfidence can occur. While this may seem of mostly
theoretical interest, in this work, we show that it can be used in practice to
the benefit of BNNs. We extend finite ReLU BNNs with infinite ReLU features via
the GP and show that the resulting model is asymptotically maximally uncertain
far away from the data while the BNNs' predictive power is unaffected near the
data. Although the resulting model approximates a full GP posterior, thanks to
its structure, it can be applied \emph{post-hoc} to any pre-trained ReLU BNN at
a low cost.

evolution of galaxies. Studies in the nearby universe show a higher AGN
fraction in interacting and merging galaxies than their isolated counterparts,
indicating that such interactions are important contributors to black hole
growth. To investigate the evolution of this role at higher redshifts, we have
compiled the largest known sample of major spectroscopic galaxy pairs (2381
with $\Delta V <5000$ km s$^{-1}$) at $0.5<z<3.0$ from observations in the
COSMOS and CANDELS surveys. We identify X-ray and IR AGN among this kinematic
pair sample, a visually identified sample of mergers and interactions, and a
mass-, redshift-, and environment-matched control sample for each in order to
calculate AGN fractions and the level of AGN enhancement as a function of
relative velocity, redshift, and X-ray luminosity. While we see a slight
increase in AGN fraction with decreasing projected separation, overall, we find
no significant enhancement relative to the control sample at any separation. In
the closest projected separation bin ($<25$ kpc, $\Delta V <1000$ km s$^{-1}$),
we find enhancements of a factor of 0.94$^{+0.21}_{-0.16}$ and
1.00$^{+0.58}_{-0.31}$ for X-ray and IR-selected AGN, respectively. While we
conclude that galaxy interactions do not significantly enhance AGN activity on
average over $0.5<z<3.0$ at these separations, given the errors and the small
sample size at the closest projected separations, our results would be
consistent with the presence of low-level AGN enhancement.

PbPb collisions. In particular, the yields of (multi)strange particles relative
to pions, increases with multiplicity and the enhancement is mode pronounced
with increasing strangeness content. We will argue, that such a pattern of
arises naturally in the thermal model taking into account exact strangeness
conservation. Furthermore, extending the thermal model by including hadron
interactions within the S-matrix approach, the ALICE data can be well
quantified by the thermal particle yields at the chiral-crossover temperature,
as previously found in central Pb-Pb collisions.

one of the most widely detected species. The question of its formation route(s)
is, therefore, of a major interest regarding astrochemical models. In this
paper, we provide an extensive review of the gas-phase formation paths that
were, or are, reported in the literature and the major astrochemical databases.
Four different gas-phase formation routes stand out : (1) CH$_3$OCH$_3$ + H$^+$
/ CH$_3$CHOH$^+$ + e$^-$, (2) C$_2$H$_5$ + O($^3$P), (3) CH$_3$OH + CH and (4)
CH$_3$CH$_2$OH + OH / CH$_3$CHOH + O($^3$P). Paths (2) and (3) were not studied
neither via laboratory or theoretical works in the low temperature and density
regime valid for the ISM. Thus, we carried out new accurate quantum chemistry
computations. A theoretical kinetics study at low temperatures (7-300 K),
adopting the RRKM scheme, was also performed. We confirm that reaction (2) is
efficient in forming acetaldehyde in the 7-300 temperature range (alpha = 1.21
x 10$^{-10}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and beta = 0.16). On the contrary, our new
computations disprove the formation of acetaldehyde through reaction (3) (alpha
= 1.84, 0.67 x 10$^{-13}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and beta = -0.07, -0.95). Path (1)
was showed to be inefficient too by recent computations, while path (4) was
formerly considered for glycolaldehyde formation, having acetaldehyde as a
by-product. In conclusions, of the four above paths only two, the (2) and (4),
are potentially efficient gas-phase reaction routes for the formation of
acetaldehyde and we encourage astrochemical modellers to only consider them.
Comparison with astronomical observations suggest that path (4) may actually
play the major role.

a system with an attosecond pulse train in the presence of an assisting laser.
  This assisting laser provides multiple pathways for the photoelectron wave
packet to reach the same final state, and interference of these pathways can be
used to probe properties of matter.
  The mechanism of AI is well-understood for isolated atoms and molecules in
the gas phase, but not so much in the condensed phase, especially if the
substrate under study is transparent.
  Then, additional pathways open up for the electron due to scattering from
neighbouring atoms.
  We investigate to what extent these additional pathways influence the
measured photoionization delay with the help of one- and three-dimensional
model systems.
  In both cases, we find that the total delay can be expressed as the sum of a
local (photoionization) delay and a non-local delay which contains the effect
of electron scattering during transport.
  The 1D system shows that the non-local delay is an oscillatory function of
the distance between the sites where ionization and scattering take place.
  A similar result is obtained in 3D, but the modulation depth of the non-local
delay is found to strongly depend on the effective scattering cross section.
  We conclude that attosecond interferometry of disordered systems like liquids
at low photon energies (20-30 eV) is mainly sensitive to the local delay, i.e.,
to changes of the photoionization dynamics induced by the immediate environment
of the ionized entity, and less to electron scattering during transport through
the medium.

surfaces (RIS) in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) enabled wireless networks,
where an RIS is deployed for enhancing the service quality of the UAV.
Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique is invoked to further improve
the spectrum efficiency of the network, while mobile users (MUs) are considered
as roaming continuously. The energy consumption minimizing problem is
formulated by jointly designing the movement of the UAV, phase shifts of the
RIS, power allocation policy from the UAV to MUs, as well as determining the
dynamic decoding order. A decaying deep Q-network (D-DQN) based algorithm is
proposed for tackling this pertinent problem. In the proposed D-DQN based
algorithm, the central controller is selected as an agent for periodically
observing the state of UAV-enabled wireless network and for carrying out
actions to adapt to the dynamic environment. In contrast to the conventional
DQN algorithm, the decaying learning rate is leveraged in the proposed D-DQN
based algorithm for attaining a tradeoff between accelerating training speed
and converging to the local optimal. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) In
contrast to the conventional Q-learning algorithm, which cannot converge when
being adopted for solving the formulated problem, the proposed D-DQN based
algorithm is capable of converging with minor constraints; 2) The energy
dissipation of the UAV can be significantly reduced by integrating RISs in
UAV-enabled wireless networks; 3) By designing the dynamic decoding order and
power allocation policy, the RIS-NOMA case consumes 11.7% less energy than the
RIS-OMA case.

suggest that these structures formed in a cloud-cloud collision. Some of the
known compact HII regions spatially overlap with sites of strong SiO emission
at velocities of [40,85] km s$^{-1}$, and are between or along the edges of SiO
gas features at [100,120] km s$^{-1}$, suggesting that the stars responsible
for ionizing the compact HII regions formed in compressed gas due to this

$n_{\rm H_2}\sim 10^5\rm cm^{-3}$ and $\sim$30 K, respectively, towards three
positions of Sgr B2. The average values of the SiO relative abundances,
integrated line intensities, and line widths are $\sim$10$^{-9}$, $\sim$11 K km

different velocity channels. Colliding clouds are efficient at producing
internal shocks with velocities $\sim$5-50 km $s^{-1}$. High-velocity shocks

energies above the A- and B-exciton, the pump pulse excites electrons and holes
far away from the K valleys in the first Brillouin zone. Electron-phonon and
hole-phonon scattering lead to a gradual relaxation of the carriers towards
small $\textit{Active Excitonic Regions}$ around K, enhancing the dielectric
screening. The accompanying time-dependent band gap renormalization dominates
over Pauli blocking and the excitonic binding energy renormalization. This
explains the delayed buildup of the transient reflection signal of the probe

training algorithm is also an approximate scheme for a bilevel supervised
training optimization problem, wherein the network-based regularizer in the
lower-level MBIR problem is optimized using an upper-level reconstruction loss.
The training problem is optimized by alternating between updating the network
weights and iteratively updating the reconstructions based on those weights. We
demonstrate the learned SUPER models' efficacy for low-dose CT image
reconstruction, for which we use the NIH AAPM Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Grand
Challenge dataset for training and testing. In our experiments, we studied
different combinations of supervised deep network priors and unsupervised
learning-based or analytical priors. Both numerical and visual results show the

scale, there is a keen interest in building or hosting frontline
supercomputers; the Top500 ranking is a nice illustration of this (implicit)
racing. Supercomputers, as well as ordinary computers, have fallen in price for
years while gaining processing power. We clearly see that, what commonly
springs up in mind when it comes to HPC is computer capability. However, when
going deeper into the topic, especially on large-scale problems, it appears
that the processing speed by itself is no longer sufficient. Indeed, the real
concern of HPC users is the time-to-output. Thus, we need to study each
important aspect in the critical path between inputs and outputs. The first
step is clearly the method, which is a conjunction of modelling with specific
considerations (hypothesis, simplifications, constraints, to name a few) and a
corresponding algorithm, which could be numerical and/or non numerical. Then
comes the topic of programming, which should yield a skillful mapping of the
algorithm onto HPC machines. Based on multicore processors, probably enhanced

deliver an increasing peak performance, the Exascale era being the current
horizon. However, getting a high fraction of the available peak performance is
more and more difficult. The Design of an efficient code that scales well on a

develop a new approach based on a reduction to a special flag structure, called
the dynamical Legendrian contact structure, on the leaf space of the CR

Porter-Zelenko [20] from the case of regular CR symbols constituting a discrete

which the original CR structure can be uniquely recovered from its
corresponding dynamical Legendrian contact structure. Our method clarifies the

developed in Porter-Zelenko [20] and their usual Tanaka prolongation, providing
a geometric interpretation of conditions under which they are equal. Motivated
by the search for homogeneous models with given nonregular symbol, we also
describe a process of reduction from the original natural frame bundle, which
is inevitable for structures with nonregular CR symbols. We demonstrate this
reduction procedure for examples whose underlying manifolds have dimension $7$

experiment and simulation. The microstructure was made up of a dispersion of
strongly texture grains (13\%) embedded in a matrix of grains with a random
texture. The cyclic stress-strain curves showed limited tension-compression
anisotropy because of the limited texture. Cyclic hardening under compression
and cyclic softening under tension occurred due to the presence of twinning.
Moreover, the twin volume fraction of the broken samples depended on whether
the sample was broken in tension or compression, indicating that
twining-detwinning occurs during the whole fatigue life. The mechanical
response of the polycrystalline alloy was simulated by means of computational
homogenization. The behavior of the Mg grains was modelled using a
phenomenological crystal plasticity model that accounted for basal, prismatic
and pyramidal slip (including isotropic and kinematic hardening) as well as
twining and detwinning. The model parameters were calibrated from the cyclic
stress-strain curves at different cyclic strain amplitudes. Numerical
simulations were used to understand the dominant deformation mechanisms and to
predict the fatigue life by means of a fatigue indicator parameter based on the
accumulated plastic shear strain in each fatigue cycle.

challenging because their ability to scatter or absorb light dramatically

surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) imaging have shown promises and respective
limitations. For instance, it is challenging to achieve diffraction-limited
resolution in SPR imaging; its refractive index sensitivity is not as localized
as desired. LSPR imaging is typically employed with dark-field microscopy on
sparse noble metal nanostructures, leading to low light throughput and
incomplete imaging. Here we demonstrate ultra near-field index modulated
PlAsmonic NanO-apeRture lAbel-free iMAging (PANORAMA) that addresses existing
issues for both SPR and LSPR imaging. PANORAMA produces diffraction-limited
lateral resolution with higher surface sensitivity compared to SPR. Its system
configuration is identical to a standard bright-field microscope using a
trans-illumination tungsten-halogen lamp instead of a laser or other
high-intensity light sources. Additionally, PANORAMA addresses the sparse
sampling issue in LSPR imaging by achieving dense sampling with a large imaging
fill factor. The bright-field approach provides much higher light throughput
compared to dark-field microscopy. Overall, our technique can provide a
panoramic view both laterally and longitudinally - overcoming the lack of
imaging depth for both SPR and LSPR imaging and the insufficient lateral
sampling for LSPR imaging. We have demonstrated that PANORAMA can size single
nanoparticle down to 25 nm, count individual nanoparticles in a cluster, and
dynamically monitor single nanoparticle approaching the plasmonic surface down
to the millisecond timescale. PANORAMA is potentially useful in single
biological nanoparticle analysis of exosomes and viruses.

  Low-dimensional Binary Convolution Filters",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been successfully applied to
many real-life problems. However, the huge memory cost of deep CNN models poses
a great challenge of deploying them on memory-constrained devices (e.g., mobile
phones). One popular way to reduce the memory cost of deep CNN model is to
train binary CNN where the weights in convolution filters are either 1 or -1
and therefore each weight can be efficiently stored using a single bit.
However, the compression ratio of existing binary CNN models is upper bounded
by around 32. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method to compress
deep CNN model by stacking low-dimensional binary convolution filters. Our
proposed method approximates a standard convolution filter by selecting and
stacking filters from a set of low-dimensional binary convolution filters. This
set of low-dimensional binary convolution filters is shared across all filters
for a given convolution layer. Therefore, our method will achieve much larger
compression ratio than binary CNN models. In order to train our proposed model,
we have theoretically shown that our proposed model is equivalent to select and
stack intermediate feature maps generated by low-dimensional binary filters.
Therefore, our proposed model can be efficiently trained using the
split-transform-merge strategy. We also provide detailed analysis of the memory
and computation cost of our model in model inference. We compared the proposed
method with other five popular model compression techniques on two benchmark
datasets. Our experimental results have demonstrated that our proposed method
achieves much higher compression ratio than existing methods while maintains
comparable accuracy.

  Underlying Hyperbolic Geometry",,,,,"cs.DS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Finding a minimum vertex cover in a network is a fundamental NP-complete
graph problem. One way to deal with its computational hardness, is to trade the
qualitative performance of an algorithm (allowing non-optimal outputs) for an
improved running time. For the vertex cover problem, there is a gap between
theory and practice when it comes to understanding this tradeoff. On the one
hand, it is known that it is NP-hard to approximate a minimum vertex cover
within a factor of $\sqrt{2}$. On the other hand, a simple greedy algorithm
yields close to optimal approximations in practice.
  A promising approach towards understanding this discrepancy is to recognize
the differences between theoretical worst-case instances and real-world
networks. Following this direction, we close the gap between theory and
practice by providing an algorithm that efficiently computes nearly optimal
vertex cover approximations on hyperbolic random graphs; a network model that
closely resembles real-world networks in terms of degree distribution,
clustering, and the small-world property. More precisely, our algorithm
computes a $(1 + o(1))$-approximation, asymptotically almost surely, and has a
running time of $\mathcal{O}(m \log(n))$.
  The proposed algorithm is an adaptation of the successful greedy approach,
enhanced with a procedure that improves on parts of the graph where greedy is
not optimal. This makes it possible to introduce a parameter that can be used
to tune the tradeoff between approximation performance and running time. Our
empirical evaluation on real-world networks shows that this allows for
improving over the near-optimal results of the greedy approach.

through two-point statistics. In observations, the estimation of the two-point
correlation function crucially relies on counting pairs in a random catalogue.
The latter contains a large number of randomly distributed points, which
accounts for the survey window function. Random pair counts can also be
advantageously used for modelling the window function in the observed power
spectrum. Since pair counting scales as $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, where $N$ is the
number of points, the computational time to measure random pair counts can be
very expensive for large surveys. In this work, we present an alternative
approach for estimating those counts that does not rely on the use of a random
catalogue. We derived an analytical expression for the anisotropic
random-random pair counts that accounts for the galaxy radial distance
distribution, survey geometry, and possible galaxy weights.
  Considering the cases of the VIPERS and SDSS-BOSS redshift surveys, we find
that the analytical calculation is in excellent agreement with the pair counts
obtained from random catalogues. The main advantage of this approach is that
the primary calculation only takes a few minutes on a single CPU and it does
not depend on the number of random points. Furthermore, it allows for an
accuracy on the monopole equivalent to what we would otherwise obtain when
using a random catalogue with about 1500 times more points than in the data at
hand. We also describe and test an approximate expression for data-random pair
counts that is less accurate than for random-random counts, but still provides
subpercent accuracy on the monopole. The presented formalism should be very
useful in accounting for the window function in next-generation surveys, which

consequence of the suppression of hybridized surface polariton waves that are
supported for transverse magnetic polarized light. We show that such reduction
is exclusively due to the appearance of magnetic-field induced hyperbolic

Disease prediction was the most common application and evaluation (31 studies).

lack of augmentation methods to generate data on graphs or surfaces. This study
proposes two unbiased augmentation methods, Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunction Data

generate new data on surfaces, whose mean is the same as that of real data.
LB-eigDA augments data via the resampling of the LB coefficients. In parallel
with LB-eigDA, we introduce a fast augmentation approach, C-pDA, that employs a
polynomial approximation of LB spectral filters on surfaces. We design LB
spectral bandpass filters by Chebyshev polynomial approximation and resample
signals filtered via these filters to generate new data on surfaces. We first
validate LB-eigDA and C-pDA via simulated data and demonstrate their use for
improving classification accuracy. We then employ the brain images of
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and extract cortical

the two augmentation methods. We demonstrate that augmented cortical thickness
has a similar pattern to real data. Second, we show that C-pDA is much faster

identifying them automatically is an integral part of natural language
understanding. However, annotating discourse relations typically requires
expert annotators. Recently, different semantic aspects of a sentence have been
represented and crowd-sourced via question-and-answer (QA) pairs. This paper
proposes a novel representation of discourse relations as QA pairs, which in
turn allows us to crowd-source wide-coverage data annotated with discourse
relations, via an intuitively appealing interface for composing such questions
and answers. Based on our proposed representation, we collect a novel and
wide-coverage QADiscourse dataset, and present baseline algorithms for
predicting QADiscourse relations.

every reflexive $L^{p(\cdot)}(\Omega)$ has the FPP and our results bring to
light the existence of some nonreflexive variable Lebesgue spaces satisfying
the $w$-FPP, in sharp contrast with the classic Lebesgue $L^p$-spaces. In
connection with the FPP, we prove that Maurey's result for $L^1$-spaces can be
extended to the larger class of variable $L^{p(\cdot)}(\Omega)$ spaces with
order continuous norm, that is, every reflexive subspace of
$L^{p(\cdot)}(\Omega)$ has the FPP. Never\-theless, Maurey's converse does not
longer hold in the variable setting, since some nonreflexive subspaces of

discover that several nonreflexive Nakano sequence spaces $\ell^{p_n}$ do have
the FPP endowed with the Luxemburg norm. As far as the authors are concerned,
this family of sequence spaces gives rise to the first known nonreflexive
classic Banach spaces enjoying the FPP without requiring of any renorming

point proxy, a spherical proxy of a variable radius is used, which avoids the
sinking of proxy during the haptic interaction of sparse data. The radius of
the proxy is adaptively varied depending upon the local density of the point
data using kernel bandwidth estimation. During the interaction, the proxy moves
in small steps tangentially over the point cloud such that the new position
always minimizes the distance between the proxy and the haptic interaction
point (HIP). The raw point cloud data re-sampled in a regular 3D lattice of
voxels are loaded to the haptic space after proper smoothing to avoid aliasing

observed that this functionality supplements the user's experience by allowing

is obtained in a few steps. First, we develop an algorithm for univariate
bounds, a sub-problem which is already PSPACE-hard. Then, a decision procedure
for multivariate bounds is achieved by reducing this problem to the univariate

the writes across the entire memory, and 2) fault tolerance, to correct memory
cell failures. However, one of the main open challenges in extending the
lifetime of existing resistive memories is to make both techniques work
together seamlessly and efficiently. To address this challenge, we propose
WoLFRaM, a new mechanism that combines both wear-leveling and fault tolerance
techniques at low cost by using a programmable resistive address decoder

efficient wear-leveling mechanism that remaps write accesses to random physical
locations on the fly, and 2) a new efficient fault tolerance mechanism that
recovers from faults by remapping failed memory blocks to available physical
locations. Our evaluations show that, for a Phase Change Memory (PCM) based
system with cell endurance of 108 writes, WoLFRaM increases the memory lifetime

likely caused by a stellar bow shock that reaccelerates \emph{preexisting} CRs,
which further propagate to the Sun along the magnetic field lines. Along their
way, these particles generate an Iroshnikov-Kraichnan (I-K) turbulence that
controls their propagation and sustains the bump. {\it Ad hoc} fitting of the
bump shape requires six adjustable parameters. Our model requires none, merely
depending on \emph{three physical unknowns that we constrain using the fit.}
These are the shock Mach number, $M$, its size, $l_{\perp}$, and the distance
to it, $\zeta_{\text{obs}}$. Altogether, they define the bump rigidity $R_{0}$.
With $M$$\approx$1.5--1.6 and $R_{0}$$\approx$4.4 TV, the model fits the data
with $\approx$$0.08\%$ accuracy. The fit critically requires the I-K spectrum
predicted by the model and rules out the alternatives. These fit's attributes
make an accidental agreement highly unlikely. In turn, $R_{0}$ and $M$ derived
from the fit impose the distance-size %($\zeta_{{\rm obs}}$$-$$l_{\perp}$)
relation on the shock: $\zeta_{{\rm
obs}}$(pc)$\sim$$10^{2}\sqrt{l_{\perp}(\text{pc})}$. For sufficiently large bow
shocks, $l_{\perp}$$=$$10^{-3}$$-$$10^{-2}$ pc, we find the distance of
$\zeta_{{\rm obs}}$$=$3--10 pc. Three promising stars in this range are:
Scholz's Star at 6.8 pc, Epsilon Indi at 3.6 pc, and Epsilon Eridani at 3.2 pc.
Based on their current positions and velocities, we propose that Epsilon Indi
and Epsilon Eridani can produce the observed spectral bump. Moreover, Epsilon
Eridani's position is only $\sim$$6.7^{\circ}$ off of the magnetic field
direction in the solar neighborhood, which also changes the CR arrival
direction distribution. Given the proximity of these stars, the bump appearance
may change in a relatively short time.

treatment of large proteins, in particular if local target quantities such as

accuracy that is achievable for such local target quantities intricately
depends on how the protein is partitioned into smaller fragments. While the
commonly employed na\""ive approach of using fragments with a fixed size is
widely used, it can result in large and unpredictable errors when varying the
fragment size. Here, we present a systematic partitioning scheme that aims at
minimizing the fragmentation error of a local target quantity for a given
maximum fragment size.
  To this end, we construct a weighted graph representation of the protein, in
which the amino acids constitute the nodes. These nodes are connected by edges
weighted with an estimate for the fragmentation error that is expected when
cutting this edge. This allows us to employ graph partitioning algorithms
provided by computer science to determine near-optimal partitions of the
protein. We apply this scheme to a test set of six proteins representing
various prototypical applications of quantum-chemical fragmentation methods

node embeddings on graphs. When applying deep GNNs on large graphs, it is still
challenging to perform training in an efficient and scalable way. We propose a
novel parallel training framework. Through sampling small subgraphs as
minibatches, we reduce training workload by orders of magnitude compared with
state-of-the-art minibatch methods. We then parallelize the key computation
steps on tightly-coupled shared memory systems. For graph sampling, we exploit
parallelism within and across sampler instances, and propose an efficient data
structure supporting concurrent accesses from samplers. The parallel sampler
theoretically achieves near-linear speedup with respect to number of processing
units. For feature propagation within subgraphs, we improve cache utilization
and reduce DRAM traffic by data partitioning. Our partitioning is a
2-approximation strategy for minimizing the communication cost compared to the
optimal. We further develop a runtime scheduler to reorder the training
operations and adjust the minibatch subgraphs to improve parallel performance.
Finally, we generalize the above parallelization strategies to support multiple
types of GNN models and graph samplers. The proposed training outperforms the
state-of-the-art in scalability, efficiency and accuracy simultaneously. On a
40-core Xeon platform, we achieve 60x speedup (with AVX) in the sampling step

implementation. Our algorithm enables fast training of deeper GNNs, as
demonstrated by orders of magnitude speedup compared to the Tensorflow

for rigid bodies in intermittent contact with each other where the contact
region is a planar non-convex contact patch.
  Such methods are useful in planning and control for robotic manipulation. The
planar non-convex contact patch can either be a topologically connected set or
disconnected set. Most work in rigid body dynamic simulation assume that the
contact between objects is a point contact, which may not be valid in many
applications. In this paper, by using the convex hull of the contact patch, we
build on our recent work on simulating rigid bodies with convex contact patches
for simulating motion of objects with planar non-convex contact patches. We
formulate a discrete-time mixed complementarity problem where we solve the
contact detection and integration of the equations of motion simultaneously. We
solve for the equivalent contact point (ECP) and contact impulse of each
contact patch simultaneously along with the state, i.e., configuration and
velocity of the objects. We prove that although we are representing a patch
contact by an equivalent point, our model for enforcing non-penetration
constraints ensure that there is no artificial penetration between the
contacting rigid bodies. We provide empirical evidence to show that our method
can seamlessly capture transition among different contact modes like patch
contact, multiple or single point contact.

their use impractical for most industrial applications. Knowing where the knots

reducing waste and improving the quality of wood-logs by-products. In this

rigid body dynamic simulators, which implicitly assume that contact between two

present techniques for simulating the motion of microrobots where there can be
intermittent and non-point contact between the robot and the substrate. We use
these techniques to study the motion of tumbling microrobots of different
shapes and select shapes that are optimal for improving locomotion performance.
Simulation results are verified using experimental data on linear velocity,
maximum climbable incline angle, and microrobot trajectory. Microrobots with
improved geometry were fabricated, but limitations in the fabrication process
resulted in unexpected manufacturing errors and material/size scale
adjustments. The developed simulation model is able to incorporate these

the experimental behavior of the tumbling microrobots, further showcasing the

medical images of large size, due to their immense computational demand. The
present work proposes a multi-scale patch-based GAN approach for establishing
unpaired domain translation by generating 3D medical image volumes of high
resolution in a memory-efficient way. The key idea to enable memory-efficient
image generation is to first generate a low-resolution version of the image
followed by the generation of patches of constant sizes but successively
growing resolutions. To avoid patch artifacts and incorporate global
information, the patch generation is conditioned on patches from previous
resolution scales. Those multi-scale GANs are trained to generate realistically
looking images from image sketches in order to perform an unpaired domain
translation. This allows to preserve the topology of the test data and generate
the appearance of the training domain data. The evaluation of the domain
translation scenarios is performed on brain MRIs of size 155x240x240 and thorax
CTs of size up to 512x512x512. Compared to common patch-based approaches, the
multi-resolution scheme enables better image quality and prevents patch
artifacts. Also, it ensures constant GPU memory demand independent from the
image size, allowing for the generation of arbitrarily large images.

is psychologically rich as its observer has complex human faculties such as a

an active and experiencing agent, with continuously refreshed, scientific

develop a displaced multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) frequency-modulated
continuous-wave (FMCW) radar signal model under coarse synchronization with
only frame-level alignment. We derive Bayesian performance bounds for the
common automotive radar processing modes such as point-cloud-based fusion as
well as raw-signal-based non-coherent and coherent imaging. For the
non-coherent mode, which offers a compromise between low computational load and
improved localization, we exploit the block sparsity of range profiles for
signal reconstruction to avoid direct computational imaging with massive data.
For the high-resolution coherent imaging, we develop a method that
automatically estimates the synchronization error and performs displaced radar
imaging by exploiting sparsity-driven recovery models. Our extensive numerical
experiments demonstrate these advantages. Our proposed non-coherent processing
of displaced MIMO FMCW radars improves position estimation by an order over the
conventional point-cloud fusion.

can speed up the testing process of patients where health care systems lack
sufficient numbers of the reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction

task of detection. Gathering labeled data is a cumbersome task and requires
time and resources which could further strain health care systems and
radiologists at the early stages of a pandemic such as COVID-19. In this study,
we propose a randomized generative adversarial network (RANDGAN) that detects
images of an unknown class (COVID-19) from known and labelled classes (Normal
and Viral Pneumonia) without the need for labels and training data from the
unknown class of images (COVID-19). We used the largest publicly available

transfer learning to segment the lungs in the COVIDx dataset. Next, we show why
segmentation of the region of interest (lungs) is vital to correctly learn the
task of classification, specifically in datasets that contain images from
different resources as it is the case for the COVIDx dataset. Finally, we show
improved results in detection of COVID-19 cases using our generative model
(RANDGAN) compared to conventional generative adversarial networks (GANs) for
anomaly detection in medical images, improving the area under the ROC curve

racism and systemic marginalisation. They also caution that the gradual creep
of face surveillance infrastructures into every domain of lived experience may
eventually eradicate the modern democratic forms of life that have long

dynamics of bias and discrimination play in the development and deployment of
FDRTs. I examine how historical patterns of discrimination have made inroads
into the design and implementation of FDRTs from their very earliest moments.
And, I explain the ways in which the use of biased FDRTs can lead
distributional and recognitional injustices. The explainer concludes with an

artworks to determine their motifs and themes andto characterize the way these
are represented. It is a subject of active research for a variety of purposes,
including the interpretation of meaning, the investigation of the origin and
diffusion in time and space of representations, and the study of influences
across artists and art works. With the proliferation of digital archives of art
images, the possibility arises of applying Computer Vision techniques to the
analysis of art images at an unprecedented scale, which may support iconography
research and education. In this paper we introduce a novel paintings data set
for iconography classification and present the quantitativeand qualitative
results of applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to the
recognition of the iconography of artworks. The proposed classifier achieves
good performances (71.17% Precision, 70.89% Recall, 70.25% F1-Score and 72.73%
Average Precision) in the task of identifying saints in Christian religious
paintings, a task made difficult by the presence of classes with very similar
visual features. Qualitative analysis of the results shows that the CNN focuses
on the traditional iconic motifs that characterize the representation of each
saint and exploits such hints to attain correct identification. The ultimate
goal of our work is to enable the automatic extraction, decomposition, and
comparison of iconography elements to support iconographic studies and
automatic art work annotation.

examination of the American Board of Pathology (ABP)? To build such a system,
three challenges need to be addressed. First, we need to create a visual
question answering (VQA) dataset where the AI agent is presented with a
pathology image together with a question and is asked to give the correct
answer. Due to privacy concerns, pathology images are usually not publicly
available. Besides, only well-trained pathologists can understand pathology
images, but they barely have time to help create datasets for AI research. The
second challenge is: since it is difficult to hire highly experienced
pathologists to create pathology visual questions and answers, the resulting
pathology VQA dataset may contain errors. Training pathology VQA models using
these noisy or even erroneous data will lead to problematic models that cannot
generalize well on unseen images. The third challenge is: the medical concepts
and knowledge covered in pathology question-answer (QA) pairs are very diverse
while the number of QA pairs available for modeling training is limited. How to
learn effective representations of diverse medical concepts based on limited
data is technically demanding. In this paper, we aim to address these three
challenges. To our best knowledge, our work represents the first one addressing
the pathology VQA problem. To deal with the issue that a publicly available
pathology VQA dataset is lacking, we create PathVQA dataset. To address the
second challenge, we propose a learning-by-ignoring approach. To address the
third challenge, we propose to use cross-modal self-supervised learning. We
perform experiments on our created PathVQA dataset and the results demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed learning-by-ignoring method and cross-modal
self-supervised learning methods.

insights into which attributes are most related to algorithm performance. We
can also fill observed gaps in the instance space in order to generate graphs
with previously unseen combinations of features. This methodology is applied to
the instance space of the Hamiltonian completion problem using two different
solvers, namely the Concorde TSP Solver and a multi-start local search

flow. High-speed recordings show that cavitation bubbles in the water slugs
often develop localized structures in form of clusters or bubble plugs, and
that such structures can be seeded via a single pinch-off from the free
interface. Within the structures, bubbles strongly interact and frequently
undergo merging or splitting events. Due to the mutual interaction and
resulting motion, bubbles often collapse with a fast displacement, suggesting
jetting dynamics. Bubble compression ratios are estimated on basis of observed
individual bubble dynamics and numerical fitting by a single bubble model. The

holds the key to understanding the architecture of stellar systems and of
planetary systems. While the interactions between point sources can be
described by simple gravity, interactions with disk material require further
knowledge about the gas viscosity and dust microphysics that needs to be
included when simulating disk-body interactions. Pre-main-sequence multiple
systems provide us with a unique laboratory to calibrate fundamental parameters
such as the viscosity and to test theories of hydrodynamic processes that might
shape protoplanetary disk structure and affect the planet populations forming
from these disks. In this article I briefly review our knowledge about a
particularly intriguing T Tauri triple star system, GW Orionis, that has the
potential to serve as a rosetta stone for hydrodynamic studies. The
3-dimensional orbits and masses of the stars in GW Orionis have been
constrained by long-term interferometric and radial velocity monitoring. Also,
the 3-dimensional geometry of the strongly distorted disk has been tightly
contrained based on high-angular resolution thermal dust emission and
scattered-light imaging. The disk-tearing effect that we might witness in GW
Ori in action constitutes an important new mechanism for moving disk material
onto highly oblique or retrograde orbits, even at very wide separations from
the star. At the same time, the observed torn ring seems sufficiently massive,
and might be sufficiently stable, for planet formation to occur, potentially
giving rise to an yet-undiscovered population of circum-multiple planets on
highly oblique, long-period orbits.
