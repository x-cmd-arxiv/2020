systems has attracted many startups across the world. These organizations have
little training or experience in the traditional processes used in civil
aviation for the development of software and electronic hardware. They are also
constrained in the resources they can allocate for dedicated teams of
professionals to follow these standardized processes. To fill this gap, this
paper presents a custom workflow based on a subset of objectives derived from
the foundational standards for safety critical software DO-178C/DO-331. The
selection of objectives from the standards is based on the importance, degree
of automation, and reusability of specific objectives. This custom workflow is
intended to establish a lean and highly automated development life cycle
resulting in higher quality software with better maintainability
characteristics for research and prototype aircraft. It can also be proposed as
means of compliance for software of certain applications such as unmanned
aircraft systems, urban air mobility and general aviation. By producing the
essential set of development and verification artifacts, the custom workflow
also provides a scalable basis for potential future certification in compliance
with DO-178C/DO-331. The custom workflow is demonstrated in a case study of an
Autopilot Manual Disconnection System.

therefore be compressed using a hierarchical low rank data structure. We
describe an efficient algorithm to build this compressed representation on the

significantly improved with a more expressive linear transform. Most surprising

human similarity judgments are asymmetric: the similarity of X to Y is not
necessarily equal to the similarity of Y to X, and allowing models to express

abundances from the thermal to the nonthermal state via diffusive shock
acceleration by a temporally evolving shock. We consider hereby not only
ionization states of elements contained in the ambient gas, which we allow to
be time dependent due to shock heating, but also elements condensed on solid,
charged dust grains which can be injected into the acceleration process as
well. Our generic parametrized model is then applied to the case of particle
acceleration by supernova remnants in various ISM phases, for which we use
state-of-the-art computation packages to calculate the ionization states of all
elements. The resulting predictions for low energy cosmic ray (LECR) source
abundances are compared with the data obtained by various experiments.
  We obtain excellent agreement for shocks in warm ionized ISM environments,
which include HII regions, if dust grains are injected into the diffusive shock
acceleration process with a much higher efficiency than ions. Less dependence
of the fit quality is found on the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. For neutral
environments, assuming that there are shocks in the weakly ionized component,
and for the hot ionized medium we obtain generally inferior fits, but except
for the cold neutral medium we do not exclude them as subdominant sites of
Galactic CR production. The key challenge is found to be putting the LECR
abundance of pure gas phase elements like neon and the (semi-)volatile elements
phosphorus, sulfur and chlorine into the right balance with silicon, calcium
and elements of the iron group. Finally, a brief outlook to the potential
consequences for the understanding of the CR composition at higher energies is

interpretable multipole coefficients. The multipole terms can be combined into
effective direction dependent parameters replacing the Hubble constant,
deceleration parameter, curvature parameter, and 'jerk' parameter of the
Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) class of metrics. Due to the
finite number of multipole coefficients, the exact anisotropic Hubble law is
given by 9, 25, 61 degrees of freedom in the $\mathcal{O}(z)$,
$\mathcal{O}(z^2)$, $\mathcal{O}(z^3)$ vicinity of the observer respectively,

uniform matrix product state algorithm to tree tensor networks. Our results
reveal an antiferromagnetic insulating phase and a paramagnetic metallic phase,
separated by a first-order doping-driven metal-insulator transition. We show
that the metallic state is a Fermi liquid with coherent quasiparticle
excitations for all values of the interaction strength $U$, and we obtain the
finite quasiparticle weight $Z$ from the single-particle occupation function of
a generalized ""momentum"" variable. We find that $Z$ decreases with increasing
$U$, ultimately saturating to a non-zero, doping-dependent value. Our work
demonstrates that tensor-network calculations on tree lattices, and the VUTS
algorithm in particular, are a platform for obtaining controlled results for
phenomena absent in one dimension, such as Fermi liquids, while avoiding
computational difficulties associated with tensor networks in two dimensions.

Grasping dataset is used to train a convolutional neural network that, having
an image of the robot`s workspace, with a certain object, is able to predict a
grasp rectangle that symbolizes the position, orientation and opening of the
robot`s grippers before its closing. In addition to this network, which runs in
real-time, another one is designed to deal with situations in which the object
moves in the environment. Therefore, the second network is trained to perform a

view. This network predicts the proportional values of the linear and angular
velocities that the camera must have so that the object is always in the image

Gradient Descent (SPGD), has better success rate compared to PGD during early
steps of the method. Adversarially training models using SPGD achieves greater
adversarial accuracy compared to PGD when holding the number of attack steps
constant. The use of SPGD can, therefore, reduce the overhead of adversarial
training when utilizing adversarial generation with a smaller number of steps.
However, we also prove that SPGD is equivalent to a variant of the PGD
ordinarily used for the $l_{\infty}$ threat model. This PGD variant omits the
sign function which is ordinarily applied to the gradient. SPGD can, therefore,
be performed without explicitly transforming into the frequency domain.
Finally, we visualize the perturbations SPGD generates and find they use both

at 45 K at ambient pressure. Here we perform transport measurements and
first-principles calculations to study the pressure effects on the
magnetic/structural coupled transition of Pb$_2$CoOsO$_6$. Experimentally we
monitor the resistivity anomaly at $T_N$ under various pressures up to 11 GPa
in a cubic anvil cell apparatus. We find that $T_N$ determined from the
resistivity anomaly first increases quickly with pressure in a large slope of
$dT_N/dP$ = +6.8(8) K/GPa for $P < 4$ GPa, and then increases with a much
reduced slope of 1.8(4) K/GPa above 4 GPa. Our first-principles calculations
suggest that the observed discontinuity of $dT_N/dP$ around 4 GPa may be
attributed to the vanishing of Os magnetic moment under pressure. Pressure
substantially reduces the Os moment and completely suppresses it above a
critical value, which relieves the magnetic frustration in the
antiferromagnetic ordering of Pb$_2$CoOsO$_6$. The Co and Os polar distortions
decrease with the increasing pressure and simultaneously vanish at the critical
pressure. Therefore above the critical pressure a new centrosymmetric
antiferromagnetic state emerges in Pb$_2$CoOsO$_6$, distinct from the one under
ambient pressure, thus showing a discontinuity in $dT_N/dP$.

an analysis of the objective of semi-supervised VAEs, we observe that they use
the posterior of the learned generative model to guide the inference model in
learning the partially observed latent variable. We show that given this
observation, it is possible to gain finer control on the effect of the
unsupervised objective on the training procedure. Using importance weighting,
we derive two novel objectives that prioritize either one of the partially
observed latent variable, or the unobserved latent variable. Experiments on the
IMDB english sentiment analysis dataset and on the AG News topic classification
dataset show the improvements brought by our prioritization mechanism and
exhibit a behavior that is inline with our description of the inner working of
Semi-Supervised VAEs.

formation. We propose that enzymatic cross-links are formed at the fibril
surface during the growth of collagen fibrils; as a consequence no significant
reorientation of previously cross-linked collagen molecules occurs inside
collagen fibrils during fibril growth in vivo. By imposing local equilibrium
only at the fibril surface, we develop a coarse-grained quantitative model of
in vivo fibril structure that incorporates a double-twist orientation of
collagen molecules and a periodic D-band density modulation along the fibril
axis. Radial growth is controlled by the density of available collagen
molecules around the fibril. In contrast with earlier equilibrium models of
fibril structure, we find that all fibrils can exhibit a core-shell structure
that is controlled only by the fibril radius. At small radii a core is
developed with a linear double-twist structure as a function of radius. Within
the core the double-twist structure is largely independent of the D-band.
Within the shell at larger radii, the structure approaches a constant twist
configuration that is strongly coupled with the D-band. We suggest a stable
radius control mechanism that corneal fibrils can exploit near the edge of the
linear core regime; while larger tendon fibrils can use a cruder version of
growth control that does not select a preferred radius.

that this radiation is generated in some local regions of shock fronts
traveling in the solar corona, where the specific conditions for the
enhancement of electromagnetic emissions near the plasma frequency harmonics
are created. The reason for such enhancement at the second harmonic may be the
formation of counter-streaming electron beams. There are different opinions in
literature on whether the second harmonic electromagnetic emission in the
presence of an additional beam can be efficient enough to markedly dominate
emissions produced by a single beam. In the present paper, we carry out
particle-in-cell simulations of the collision of two symmetric electron beams
in plasma with open boundary conditions and show that the efficiency of
beam-to-radiation power conversion can be significantly increased compared to
models with periodic boundary conditions and reach the level of a few percent

micron-sized dust into macroscopic aggregates. This phase is likely to happen
very early during the protostellar disc formation, which is characterised by
active gas dynamics. We present numerical simulations of
protostellar/protoplanetary disc long-term evolution, which includes gas
dynamics with self-gravity in the thin-disc limit, and bidisperse dust grain
evolution due to coagulation, fragmentation, and drift through the gas. We show
that the decrease of the grain size to the disc periphery leads to sharp outer
edges in dust millimetre emission, which are explained by a drop in dust
opacity coefficient rather than by dust surface density variations. These
visible outer edges are at the location where average grain size $\approx
\lambda/2\pi$, where $\lambda$ is the observational wavelength, so discs
typically look more compact at longer wavelengths if dust size decreases
outwards. This allows a simple recipe for reconstructing grain sizes in disc
outer regions. Discs may look larger at longer wavelengths if grain size does
not reach $\lambda/2\pi$ for some wavelength. Disc visible sizes evolve
non-monotonically over the first million years and differ from dust and gas
physical sizes by factor of a few. We compare our model with recent observation
data on gas and dust disc sizes, far-infrared fluxes and spectral indices of
protoplanetary discs in Lupus. We also show that non-monotonic variations of
the grain size in radial direction can cause wavelength-dependent opacity gaps,

sample size need to account for their optional stopping to guarantee strict
type-I error-rate control. A variety of different methods to maintain type-I
error-rate control after unplanned changes of the initial sample size have been
proposed in the literature. This makes interim analyses for the purpose of
sample size recalculation feasible in a regulatory context. Since the sample
size is usually determined via an argument based on the power of the trial, an
interim analysis raises the question of how the final sample size should be
determined conditional on the accrued information. Conditional power is a
concept often put forward in this context. Since it depends on the unknown
effect size, we take a strict estimation perspective and compare assumed

respect to their properties as estimators of the unknown conditional power. We
then demonstrate that pre-planning an interim analysis using methodology for
unplanned interim analyses is ineffective and naturally leads to the concept of
optimal two-stage designs. We conclude that unplanned design adaptations should
only be conducted as reaction to trial-external new evidence, operational needs
to violate the originally chosen design, or post hoc changes in the objective
criterion. Finally, we show that commonly discussed sample size recalculation
rules can lead to paradoxical outcomes and propose two alternative ways of
reacting to newly emerging trial-external evidence.

node-aligned networks. The majority of current methods, such as normalized
mutual information, compare two node partitions derived from a community
detection algorithm yet ignore the respective underlying network topologies.
Addressing this gap, our method deploys a community detection quality function
to assess the fit of each node partition with respect to the other network's
connectivity structure. Specifically, for two networks A and B, we project the
node partition of B onto the connectivity structure of A. By evaluating the fit
of B's partition relative to A's own partition on network A (using a standard
quality function), we quantify how well network A describes the modular
structure of B. Repeating this in the other direction, we obtain a
two-dimensional distance measure, the bi-directional (BiDir) distance. The
advantages of our methodology are three-fold. First, it is adaptable to a wide
class of community detection algorithms that seek to optimize an objective
function. Second, it takes into account the network structure, specifically the
strength of the connections within and between communities, and can thus
capture differences between networks with similar partitions but where one of
them might have a more defined or robust community structure. Third, it can
also identify cases in which dissimilar optimal partitions hide the fact that
the underlying community structure of both networks is relatively similar. We
illustrate our method for a variety of community detection algorithms,
including multi-resolution approaches, and a range of both simulated and real
world networks.

function projection (EMAP), for isolating whether or not cross-modal
interactions improve performance for a given model on a given task. This
function projection modifies model predictions so that cross-modal interactions
are eliminated, isolating the additive, unimodal structure. For seven
image+text classification tasks (on each of which we set new state-of-the-art
benchmarks), we find that, in many cases, removing cross-modal interactions
results in little to no performance degradation. Surprisingly, this holds even
when expressive models, with capacity to consider interactions, otherwise
outperform less expressive models; thus, performance improvements, even when
present, often cannot be attributed to consideration of cross-modal feature
interactions. We hence recommend that researchers in multimodal machine
learning report the performance not only of unimodal baselines, but also the
EMAP of their best-performing model.

for decision making. The cornerstone for such impact assessments is estimating
the transportation mode-shift resulting from the intervention. And while
transportation planning has well-established models for the mode-choice
assessment such as the nested multinomial logit model, an individual choice
simulation could be better suited for addressing the mode-shift allowing to
consistently account for individual preferences. In addition, no model
perfectly represents the reality while the available ground truth data on the
actual transportation choices needed to infer the model is often incomplete or
inconsistent. The present paper addresses those challenges by offering an
individual mode-choice and mode-shift simulation model and the Bayesian
inference framework. It accounts for uncertainties in the data as well as the
model estimate and translates them into uncertainties of the resulting
mode-shift and the impacts. The framework is evaluated on the two intervention

$y$ and $\mu$ measurements by considering a range of grain size distributions
and compositions constrained by theoretical and observational priors (Zelko &
Finkbeiner 2020). We find that PIXIE can marginalize over a modest number of

free-free), the estimates of $y$ degrade, and measurement of $\mu$ in the range
sometimes considered for the standard $\Lambda$CDM of $2\times10^{-8}$ becomes
infeasible without ancillary low-frequency foreground information. An
additional concern is dust absorption of the CMB monopole, a subtle effect that
must be included. We quantify one form of model discrepancy error, finding that
the error introduced by fitting our interstellar medium dust model with a
modified blackbody is too large for CMB spectral distortions to be detectable.
The greatest challenge may be the cosmic infrared background (CIB). We find
that $\mu$ and $y$ are extremely sensitive to modeling choices for the CIB, and
quantify biases expected for a range of assumptions.

estimates typically assume spherical symmetry and dynamical equilibrium,
assumptions that may not hold for the sparse GC population of dwarfs in galaxy
clusters. We use a catalog of GCs tagged onto the Illustris simulation to study
the accuracy of GC-based mass estimates. We focus on galaxies in the stellar
mass range 10$^{8} - 10^{11.8}$ M$_{\odot}$ identified in $9$ simulated
Virgo-like clusters. Our results indicate that mass estimates are, on average,
quite accurate in systems with GC numbers $N_{\rm GC} \geq 10$ and where the
uncertainty of individual GC line-of-sight velocities is smaller than the
inferred velocity dispersion, $\sigma_{\rm GC}$. In cases where $N_{\rm GC}
\leq 10$, however, biases may result depending on how $\sigma_{\rm GC}$ is
computed. We provide calibrations that may help alleviate these biases in
methods widely used in the literature. As an application, we find a number of
dwarfs with $M_{*} \sim 10^{8.5}\, M_{\odot}$ (comparable to the ultradiffuse
galaxy DF2, notable for the low $\sigma_{GC}$ of its $10$ GCs) with

first application of the method reveals the existence of vast stellar coronae,
extending for $\gtrsim\,$100 pc and surrounding the, by comparison tiny and
compact, cluster cores. The coronae and cores form intertwined, co-eval, and
co-moving extended cluster populations, each encompassing tens of thousands of
cubic parsec and stretching across tens of degrees on the sky. Our analysis
shows that the coronae are gravitationally unbound but largely comprise the
bulk of the populations' stellar mass. Most systems are in a highly dynamic
state, showing evidence of expansion and sometimes simultaneous contraction
along different spatial axes. The velocity field of the extended populations
for the cluster cores appears asymmetric but is aligned along a spatial axis
unique to each cluster. The overall spatial distribution and the kinematic

Leptoquark mixing after the former acquires a vacuum expectation value. In our

characterised from the innermost regions of the Milky Way to the halo, with the
aim of placing constraints on the Galaxys evolution. The compiled sample
(N_RRab = 64,850) stems from fundamental mode RR Lyrae variables identified by
the VVV, OGLE, and Gaia surveys. The distribution is well fitted by three power
laws over three radial intervals. In the innermost region (R < 2.2 deg) the
distribution follows Sigma_RRab[1] propto R ^(-0.94 +- 0.051), while in the
external region the distribution adheres to Sigma_RRab[2] propto R^(-1.50 +-
0.019) for 2.2 deg< R <8.0 deg and Sigma_RRab[3] propto R ^(-2.43 +- 0.043) for
8.0 deg < R <30.0 deg. Conversely, the cumulative distribution of red clump
(RC) giants exhibits a more concentrated distribution in the mean, but in the
central R < 2.2 deg the RRab population is more peaked, whereas globular
clusters (GCs) follow a density power law (Sigma_GCs propto R ^(-1.59 +- 0.060)
for R<30.0 deg) similar to that of RRab stars, especially when considering a
more metal-poor subsample ([Fe/H]<-1.1 dex). The main conclusion emerging from
the analysis is that the RRab distribution favours the star cluster infall and
merger scenario for creating an important fraction (>18 %) of the central
Galactic region. The radii containing half of the populations (half populations
radii) are R_H=6.8 deg (0.99 kpc), R_H =4.2 deg (0.61 kpc), and R_H =11.9 deg
(1.75 kpc) for the RRab stars, RC giants, and GCs, respectively. Finally,
merely 1% of the stars have been actually discovered in the innermost region (R
< 35 pc) out of the expected (based on our considerations) total number of RRab
therein: N sim 1,562. That deficit will be substantially ameliorated with
future space missions like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly

dust continuum sizes which are roughly half of those for the lower-redshift

decisions for stochastic optimization problems. Fundamentally, a data-driven
decision is simply a function that maps the available training data to a
feasible action. It can always be expressed as the minimizer of a surrogate
optimization model constructed from the data. The quality of a data-driven
decision is measured by its out-of-sample risk. An additional quality measure
is its out-of-sample disappointment, which we define as the probability that
the out-of-sample risk exceeds the optimal value of the surrogate optimization
model. An ideal data-driven decision should minimize the out-of-sample risk
simultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure as the
true measure is unkown. Unfortunately, such ideal data-driven decisions are
generally unavailable. This prompts us to seek data-driven decisions that
minimize the out-of-sample risk subject to an upper bound on the out-of-sample
disappointment. We prove that such Pareto-dominant data-driven decisions exist
under conditions that allow for interesting applications: the unknown
data-generating probability measure must belong to a parametric ambiguity set,
and the corresponding parameters must admit a sufficient statistic that
satisfies a large deviation principle. We can further prove that the surrogate
optimization model must be a distributionally robust optimization problem
constructed from the sufficient statistic and the rate function of its large
deviation principle. Hence the optimal method for mapping data to decisions is
to solve a distributionally robust optimization model. Maybe surprisingly, this
result holds even when the training data is non-i.i.d. Our analysis reveals how
the structural properties of the data-generating stochastic process impact the
shape of the ambiguity set underlying the optimal distributionally robust
model.

then make accurate super-resolution (SR) versions of different low-resolution

generating SR versions. Specifically, we are able to enhance the simulation
resolution by generating 512 times more particles and predicting their
displacements from the initial positions. Therefore our results can be viewed
as new simulation realizations themselves rather than projections, e.g., to
their density fields. Furthermore, the generation process is stochastic,
enabling us to sample the small-scale modes conditioning on the large-scale

simulations, and is then able to generate SR simulations that successfully
reproduce the HR matter power spectrum to percent level up to
$16\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$, and the HR halo mass function to within $10 \%$ down

visual binary. We have used high-resolution imaging with the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST), obtained over nearly two decades, to determine the period
(21.568 yr) and precise orbital elements. Combining these with published
ground- and space-based astrometry, we determined dynamical masses for both
components of $\mu$ Cas: $0.7440\pm0.0122\,M_\odot$ for the G5 V primary, and
$0.1728\pm0.0035\,M_\odot$ for its faint dM companion. We detect no significant
perturbations in the HST astrometry due to a third body in the system. The
primary aim of our program was to determine, with the aid of stellar models,
the helium content and age of the metal-deficient primary star, $\mu$ Cas A.
Although we now have a precise mass, there remain uncertainties about other
parameters, including its effective temperature. Moreover, a re-examination of
archival interferometric observations leads to a suspicion that the angular
diameter was overestimated by a few percent. In the absolute magnitude versus
color plane, $\mu$ Cas A lies slightly cooler and more luminous than the main
sequence of the globular cluster 47 Tucanae; this may imply that the star has a
lower helium content, and/or is older, and/or has a higher metallicity, than
the cluster. Our best estimates for the helium content and age of $\mu$ Cas A
are $Y=0.255\pm0.014$ and $12.7\pm2.7$ Gyr--making $\mu$ Cas possibly the
oldest star in the sky visible to the naked eye. Improved measurements of the
absolute parallax of the system, the effective temperature of $\mu$ Cas A, and
its angular diameter would provide tighter constraints.

establishment between two wireless communication parties. It offers
information-theoretic security and is an attractive alternative to public-key

a shared entropy source to generate cryptographic key material. However,
practical implementations often suffer from static channel conditions which

IRS is well-suited to provide randomness for conventional resource-constrained

IRS-based physical-layer key generation with an OFDM system. In a static

systematically investigate the comparisons with naive least-square-regression

the proposed model inference optimally uses the basis and the redundant data.
We then study the sample complexity of the proposed model inference in the
presence of observation noise, which leads to the dependence of the processed
bias in the observed system trajectory on time and coordinates. Particularly,
we derive the sample-complexity upper bound (on the number of observations
sufficient to infer a model with prescribed levels of accuracy and confidence)

to form neutral atomic hydrogen (HI), the conversion of HI to the molecular
state (H$_2$), and, finally, the conversion of H$_2$ to stars. Understanding
galaxy evolution thus requires understanding the evolution of both the stars,
and the neutral atomic and molecular gas, the primary fuel for star-formation,
in galaxies. For the stars, the cosmic star-formation rate density is known to
peak in the redshift range $z \approx 1-3$, and to decline by an order of
magnitude over the next $\approx 10$ billion years; the causes of this decline
are not known. For the gas, the weakness of the hyperfine HI 21cm transition,
the main tracer of the HI content of galaxies, has meant that it has not
hitherto been possible to measure the atomic gas mass of galaxies at redshifts
higher than $\approx 0.4$; this is a critical lacuna in our understanding of
galaxy evolution. Here, we report a measurement of the average HI mass of
star-forming galaxies at a redshift $z \approx 1$, by stacking their individual
HI 21 cm emission signals. We obtain an average HI mass similar to the average
stellar mass of the sample. We also estimate the average star-formation rate of
the same galaxies from the 1.4 GHz radio continuum, and find that the HI mass
can fuel the observed star-formation rates for only $\approx 1-2$ billion years
in the absence of fresh gas infall. This suggests that gas accretion onto
galaxies at $z < 1$ may have been insufficient to sustain high star-formation
rates in star-forming galaxies. This is likely to be the cause of the decline
in the cosmic star-formation rate density at redshifts below 1.

of three-dimensional combined heaving and pitching hydrofoils by extending the
three-dimensional pitching scaling laws introduced by Ayancik et al. (2019).
New self-propelled inviscid simulations and previously published experimental
data are used to validate the scaling laws over a wide range of motion
amplitudes, Strouhal numbers, heave ratios, aspect ratios, and pitching axis
locations. The developed scaling laws are shown to predict inviscid numerical
data and experimental data well, within $\pm$ 25% and $\pm$ 16% of the thrust
and power data, respectively. The scaling laws reveal that both the circulatory
and added mass forces are important when considering a wide range of motion
amplitudes and that nonlinear corrections to the classic linear theory are
essential to modeling the performance across this wide amplitude range. By
using the scaling laws as a guide, it is determined that peak efficiencies
occur when $A^*$ > 1 and for these large-amplitude motions, there is an optimal
$h^*$ that maximizes the efficiency in the narrow range of 0.75 < $h^*$ < 0.94.
Finally, the scaling laws show that to further improve efficiency in this
high-efficiency regime, the aspect ratio, and dimensionless amplitude should be
increased, while the Lighthill number should be decreased (lower drag and/or a
larger propulsor planform area to wetted surface area ratio), and the pitch
axis should be located behind the leading edge. This scaling model can be used
to guide the design of the next generation of high-efficiency bio-inspired
machines.

points around the central Dirac cone in the moir\'e Brillouin zone due to the
presence of trigonal warping. The satellite cones have opposite chirality to
the central Dirac cone. Considering the overlap of the bands in energy, which
lead to metallic states, we construct the experimentally observable phase
diagram of the system in terms of the indirect bandgap and the anomalous valley
Hall conductivity. We show that while most of the intermediate phase becomes
metallic, there is a narrow parameter regime where the transition through three

good convergence in the kernel based on three-loop bubble-chain diagram
analyses. These results are encouraging for the quasi-PDF program. However,
firm conclusions can only be drawn after the complete higher loop QCD
calculations are carried out.

measurement of strain fields on a deforming material at high spatial and

the known deformation field becomes an interesting possibility. This is known
as an inverse problem. Current approaches to this problem, such as the finite
element update method, are generally over-determined and must rely on
statistical approaches to minimize error. This provides approximate solutions
in some cases, however, implementation difficulties, computational
requirements, and accuracy are still significant challenges. Here, we show how
the inverse problem can be formulated deterministically and solved exactly in
two or three dimensions for large classes of materials including isotropic
elastic solids, Newtonian fluids, non-Newtonian fluids, granular materials and
isotropic plastic solids. This solution is based on a single assumption of the
alignment of the principal directions of stress and strain or strain rate. No
further assumptions regarding incompressibility, pressure independence, yield
surface shape or the hardening law are necessary. This assumption leads to a
closed, first order, linear system of hyperbolic partial differential equations
with variable coefficients and can be solved to give the solution for any
geometry and loading condition. We provide a numerical proof-of-principle study
of the plastic deformation of a two-dimensional bar with spatially varying
yield stress and strain hardening coefficient. The results are validated
indicating the solution is exact up to numerical error. No model calibration or
material parameters are required. Interestingly, this solution procedure lends
itself to a simple physical interpretation of stress propagation through the
material.

Benefiting from the progress of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to explore
structural features and spatial image information, Single Image Depth
Estimation (SIDE) is often highlighted in scopes of scientific and
technological innovation, as this concept provides advantages related to its
low implementation cost and robustness to environmental conditions. In the
context of autonomous vehicles, state-of-the-art CNNs optimize the SIDE task by
producing high-quality depth maps, which are essential during the autonomous

high-performance Graphic Processing Units (GPUs). Therefore, we propose a new

(EDL) on Mars eliminates the need to carry a propulsion or airbag landing
system. This reduces the total mass inside the aeroshell by more than 100 kg
and simplifies the aeroshell architecture. MAD's lighter and simpler design is
likely to bring the risk and cost associated with the mission down. Moreover,
the lighter entry mass enables landing in the Martian highlands, at elevations
inaccessible to current EDL technologies. This paper proposes a novel MAD
concept for a Mars helicopter. We suggest a minimum science payload package to
perform relevant science in the highlands. A variant of the Ingenuity
helicopter is proposed to provide increased deceleration during MAD, and enough
lift to fly the science payload in the highlands. We show in simulation that
the lighter aeroshell results in a lower terminal velocity (30 m/s) at the end
of the parachute phase of the EDL, and at higher altitudes than other
approaches. After discussing the aerodynamics, controls, guidance, and
mechanical challenges associated with deploying at such speed, we propose a
backshell architecture that addresses them to release the helicopter in the
safest conditions. Finally, we implemented the helicopter model and aerodynamic
descent perturbations in the JPL Dynamics and Real-Time Simulation
(DARTS)framework. Preliminary performance evaluation indicates landing and
helicopter operation scan be achieved up to 5 km MOLA (Mars Orbiter Laser

the distant tide approximation (DTA) for which the impact parameter, $b$, is
assumed to be significantly larger than the characteristic radii of the
subject, $r_{\mathrm{S}}$, and the perturber, $r_{\mathrm{P}}$. The perturber
potential is then expanded as a multipole series and truncated at the
quadrupole term. When the perturber is more extended than the subject, this
standard approach can be extended to the case where $r_{\mathrm{S}} \ll b <
r_{\mathrm{P}}$. However, for encounters with $b$ of order $r_{\mathrm{S}}$ or
smaller, the DTA typically overpredicts the impulse, $\Delta \mathbf{v}$, and
hence the internal energy change of the subject, $\Delta E_{\mathrm{int}}$.
This is unfortunate, as these close encounters are the most interesting,
potentially leading to tidal capture, mass stripping, or tidal disruption.
Another drawback of the DTA is that $\Delta E_{\mathrm{int}}$ is proportional
to the moment of inertia, which diverges unless the subject is truncated or has
a density profile that falls off faster than $r^{-5}$. To overcome these
shortcomings, this paper presents a fully general, non-perturbative treatment
of impulsive encounters which is valid for any impact parameter, and not
hampered by divergence issues, thereby negating the necessity to truncate the
subject. We present analytical expressions for $\Delta \mathbf{v}$ for a
variety of perturber profiles, apply our formalism to both straight-path
encounters and eccentric orbits, and discuss the mass loss due to tidal shocks
in gravitational encounters between equal mass galaxies.

brain through the facilitation of neuronal communication, and the non-invasive
characterization of this structure remains a research frontier in the
neuroscience community. Efforts to assess white matter microstructure, however,
are hampered by the sheer amount of information needed for characterization.
Current techniques within neuroimaging deal with this problem by representing
white matter features with single scalars that are often not easy to interpret.
Here, we address these issues by introducing tools from materials science for
the characterization of white matter microstructure. We investigate structure
on a mesoscopic scale by analyzing its homogeneity and determining which
regions of the brain are structurally homogeneous, or ""crystalline"" in the
context of materials science. We find that crystallinity provides novel
information and varies across the brain along interpretable lines of anatomical
difference, with highest homogeneity in regions adjacent to the corpus
callosum. Furthermore, crystallinity is highly reliable, and yet also varies
between individuals, making it a potentially useful biomarker to examine
individual differences in white matter along various dimensions. We also
parcellate white matter into ""crystal grains,"" or contiguous sets of voxels of
high structural similarity, and find overlap with other white matter
parcellations. Finally, we characterize the shapes of local white matter
signatures through another tool from materials science - bond-orientational
order parameters - and locate fiber crossings and fascicles with this new
technique. Our results provide new means of assessing white matter
microstructure on multiple length scales, and open new avenues of future
inquiry. We hope that this work fosters future productive dialogue between the
fields of soft matter and neuroscience.

attacks that has achieved SOTA provable robustness against $\ell_2$
perturbations. A number of publications have extended the guarantees to other
metrics, such as $\ell_1$ or $\ell_\infty$, by using different smoothing
measures. Although the current framework has been shown to yield near-optimal
$\ell_p$ radii, the total safety region certified by the current framework can
be arbitrarily small compared to the optimal. In this work, we propose a
framework to improve the certified safety region for these smoothed classifiers
without changing the underlying smoothing scheme. The theoretical contributions
are as follows: 1) We generalize the certification for randomized smoothing by
reformulating certified radius calculation as a nested optimization problem
over a class of functions. 2) We provide a method to calculate the certified
safety region using $0^{th}$-order and $1^{st}$-order information for
Gaussian-smoothed classifiers. We also provide a framework that generalizes the
calculation for certification using higher-order information. 3) We design
efficient, high-confidence estimators for the relevant statistics of the
first-order information. Combining the theoretical contribution 2) and 3)
allows us to certify safety region that are significantly larger than the ones
provided by the current methods. On CIFAR10 and Imagenet datasets, the new
regions certified by our approach achieve significant improvements on general
$\ell_1$ certified radii and on the $\ell_2$ certified radii for color-space
attacks ($\ell_2$ restricted to 1 channel) while also achieving smaller
improvements on the general $\ell_2$ certified radii. Our framework can also
provide a way to circumvent the current impossibility results on achieving
higher magnitude of certified radii without requiring the use of data-dependent
smoothing techniques.

GNN demixing as a special case. In demixing, one seeks identification of two
signals given their sum and prior structural information. Here, we assume each
signal lies in the range of a Lipschitz function, which includes many popular
GNNs as a special case. We prove a sample complexity bound for nearly optimal
recovery error that extends a recent result of Bora, et al. (2017) from the
compressed sensing setting with gaussian matrices to demixing with subgaussian
ones. Under a linear signal model in which the signals lie in convex sets,
McCoy & Tropp (2014) have characterized the sample complexity for
identification under subgaussian mixing. In the present setting, the signal
structure need not be convex. For example, our result applies to a domain that
is a non-convex union of convex cones. We support the efficacy of this demixing
model with numerical simulations using trained GNNs, suggesting an algorithm

Subsequently, we compare the EG method with the classic continuous Galerkin

methods provide similar approximations for the pressure solution of Terzaghi's
one-dimensional consolidation, the CG method produces spurious oscillations in
fluid pressure and volumetric strain solutions at material interfaces that have
permeability contrast and does not conserve mass locally. As a result, the flux
approximation of the CG method is significantly different from the one of EG
and DG methods, especially for the soft materials. The difference of flux
approximation between EG and DG methods is insignificant; still, the EG method

impact of damping as a system parameter on the stability, hyperbolicity, and
bifurcation in such systems. We prove a monotonic effect of damping on the
hyperbolicity of the equilibrium points of the corresponding first-order
system. This provides a rigorous formulation and theoretical justification for
the intuitive notion that damping increases stability. To establish this
result, we prove a matrix perturbation result for complex symmetric matrices
with positive semidefinite perturbations to their imaginary parts, which may be
of independent interest. Furthermore, we establish necessary and sufficient
conditions for the breakdown of hyperbolicity of the first-order system under
damping variations in terms of observability of a pair of matrices relating
damping, inertia, and Jacobian matrices, and propose sufficient conditions for
Hopf bifurcation resulting from such hyperbolicity breakdown. The developed
theory has significant applications in the stability of electric power systems,
which are one of the most complex and important engineering systems. In
particular, we characterize the impact of damping on the hyperbolicity of the
swing equation model which is the fundamental dynamical model of power systems,

Neuromotor signature duplication methods and feature space augmentation methods

techniques manually or empirically define a set of parameters to introduce a
degree of writer variability. Therefore, in the present study, a method to
automatically model the most common writer variability traits is proposed. The
method is used to generate offline signatures in the image and the feature
space and train an ASVS. We also introduce an alternative approach to evaluate
the quality of samples considering their feature vectors. We evaluated the
performance of an ASVS with the generated samples using three well-known
offline signature datasets: GPDS, MCYT-75, and CEDAR. In GPDS-300, when the SVM
classifier was trained using one genuine signature per writer and the
duplicates generated in the image space, the Equal Error Rate (EER) decreased
from 5.71% to 1.08%. Under the same conditions, the EER decreased to 1.04%

classic von Neumann behavior is observed where a bubble's growth rate depends
only on its number $n$ of sides. For wet foams, the inflated borders impede gas
exchange and cause deviations from von Neumann's law that are found to be in
accord with the generalized coarsening equation. In particular, the overall
growth rate varies linearly with the film height, which decrease as surface
Plateau borders inflate. And, more interestingly, the deviation from

$nCr/\sqrt{A}$. This is highlighted definitively by data for six-sided bubbles,

it is important to protect patient privacy. In such settings, methods for
differentially private (DP) learning provide a general-purpose approach to
learn models with privacy guarantees. Modern methods for DP learning ensure
privacy through mechanisms that censor information judged as too unique. The
resulting privacy-preserving models, therefore, neglect information from the
tails of a data distribution, resulting in a loss of accuracy that can
disproportionately affect small groups. In this paper, we study the effects of
DP learning in health care. We use state-of-the-art methods for DP learning to
train privacy-preserving models in clinical prediction tasks, including x-ray
classification of images and mortality prediction in time series data. We use
these models to perform a comprehensive empirical investigation of the
tradeoffs between privacy, utility, robustness to dataset shift, and fairness.
Our results highlight lesser-known limitations of methods for DP learning in
health care, models that exhibit steep tradeoffs between privacy and utility,
and models whose predictions are disproportionately influenced by large
demographic groups in the training data. We discuss the costs and benefits of
differentially private learning in health care.

to new devices, the WW performance is not guaranteed because the AFE is unknown

proton and the interaction of these quarks with quarks of another hadron can be
described simultaneously. The model of a three-particle bispinor field is used
for this purpose. Such a field, in comparison with the usual one-particle
field, is considered not on Minkowski space, but on a subset of the tensor
product of three Minkowski spaces, which is characterized by the equality of
time coordinates of three events (subset of simultaneity). Such a subset cannot
be distinguished by the Lorentz invariant method. But due to the multiparticle
field transformation law in the transition from one inertial system to another
one, the dynamic equations for a three-particle field are consistent with the
principle of relativity. The interaction between quarks is introduced by
requiring a local SUc(3) invariance. But in the paper a more general way to
achieve this invariance than the replacement in Lagrangian of ordinary
derivatives by covariance is proposed. The applied procedure leads to a
two-index tensor of gauge field, both for Lorentz and internal indices. The
connection of this field with the bound states of gluons - glueballs is
discussed. It is shown that this glueball field can be represented as the sum
of two terms: the classical field, which plays the role of the potential energy
of quark interaction in the proton, and the field corresponding to quantum
fluctuations around the classical field and describes the quark interaction in
proton with other hadrons. A dynamic equation is obtained for the field that

there is strong interest to apply LiDARs in autonomous driving. Different
existing approaches process the rich 3D point clouds for object detection,
tracking and recognition. These methods generally require two initial steps:
(1) filter points on the ground plane and (2) cluster non-ground points into
objects. This paper proposes a field-tested fast 3D point cloud segmentation
method for these two steps. Our specially designed algorithms allow instantly
process raw LiDAR data packets, which significantly reduce the processing
delay. In our tests on Velodyne UltraPuck, a 32 layers spinning LiDAR, the
processing delay of clustering all the $360^\circ$ LiDAR measures is less than
1ms. Meanwhile, a coarse-to-fine scheme is applied to ensure the clustering
quality. Our field experiments in public roads have shown that the proposed
method significantly improves the speed of 3D point cloud clustering whilst

computer vision tasks. Many of the recent approaches have been based on
contrastive instance discrimination (CID), in which the network is trained to
recognize two augmented versions of the same instance (a query and positive)
while discriminating against a pool of other instances (negatives). The learned
representation is then used on downstream tasks such as image classification.
Using methodology from MoCo v2 (Chen et al., 2020), we divided negatives by
their difficulty for a given query and studied which difficulty ranges were
most important for learning useful representations. We found a minority of
negatives -- the hardest 5% -- were both necessary and sufficient for the
downstream task to reach nearly full accuracy. Conversely, the easiest 95% of
negatives were unnecessary and insufficient. Moreover, the very hardest 0.1% of
negatives were unnecessary and sometimes detrimental. Finally, we studied the
properties of negatives that affect their hardness, and found that hard
negatives were more semantically similar to the query, and that some negatives
were more consistently easy or hard than we would expect by chance. Together,
our results indicate that negatives vary in importance and that CID may benefit
from more intelligent negative treatment.

of death and loss of life years. Classical hypotheses for atherosclerosis are
long-standing mainly to explain atherogenesis. Unfortunately, these hypotheses
may not explain the variation in the susceptibility to atherosclerosis. These
issues are controversial over the past 150 years. Atherosclerosis from human
coronary arteries was examined and triangle of media was found to be a true
portraiture of cells injury in the media, and triangle of intima was a true
portraiture of myofibroblast proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM)
secretion, collagen fiber formation and intimal thickening to repair media
dysfunction. Myofibroblasts, ECM and lumen (intima)/vasa vasorum (VV)
(adventitia) constitute granulation tissue repair. With granulation tissue
hyperplasia, lots of collagen fibers (normal or denatured), foam cells and new
capillaries formed. Thus, the following theory was postulated: Risk factors
induce smooth muscle cells (SMCs) injury/loss, and fibrosis or structure
destruction could be developed in the media, which lead to media dysfunction.
Media dysfunction prompts disturbed mechanical properties of blood vessels,
resulting in bigger pressure buildup in the intima and adventitia. Granulation
tissues in the intima/adventitia develop to repair the injured media.
Atherosclerosis, stiffening or aneurysm develops depending on media dysfunction
severity and granulated tissue repair mode/degree. Nearly all characteristics
of clinical atherosclerosis could be ideally interpreted with the theory. We
believe that media dysfunction is a key initiator in the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis. It is expected that media dysfunction theory of
atherosclerosis, should offer better understanding of the etiology for
atherosclerosis.

prediction tasks by mapping the entities and relations from a knowledge graph

the design of the KGE, as well as the inherited abilities from the underlying

embeds nodes of a KG on the trajectories of Ordinary Differential Equations

field on a smooth Riemannian manifold. We specifically parameterize ODEs by a
neural network to represent various complex shape manifolds and more
importantly complex shape vector fields on the manifold. Therefore, the
underlying embedding space is capable of getting various geometric forms to
encode complexity in subgraph structures with different motifs. Experiments on

trajectories as a means to structure preservation and consequently avoiding
wrong inferences over state-of-the-art KGE models.

screening strategies can alleviate such issues. However, due to heavier tail
distribution and complex dependence structure of interaction effects,
innovative robust and/or model-free methods for screening interactions are
required to better scale analysis of complex and high-throughput data. In this
work, we develop a new model-free interaction screening method, termed Kendall
Interaction Filter (KIF), for the classification in high-dimensional settings.
The KIF method suggests a weighted-sum measure, which compares the overall to
the within-cluster Kendall's $\tau$ of pairs of predictors, to select
interactive couples of features. The proposed KIF measure captures relevant
interactions for the clusters response-variable, handles continuous,
categorical or a mixture of continuous-categorical features, and is invariant
under monotonic transformations. We show that the KIF measure enjoys the sure
screening property in the high-dimensional setting under mild conditions,
without imposing sub-exponential moment assumptions on the features'
distributions. We illustrate the favorable behavior of the proposed methodology

conduct real data analyses to demonstrate its utility.

special precautions are not taken. This study presents a combined experimental
and numerical analysis to identify transmission mechanisms on an urban bus and
assess strategies to reduce risk. The effects of the ventilation and
air-conditioning systems, opening windows and doors, and wearing masks are
analyzed. Specific attention is made to the transport of sub-micron and
micron-size particles relevant to typical respiratory droplets. High-resolution
instrumentation was used to measure size distribution and aerosol response time
on a University of Michigan campus bus under these different conditions.
Computational fluid dynamics was employed to measure the airflow within the bus
and evaluate risk. A risk metric was adopted based on the number of particles
exposed to susceptible passengers. The flow that carries these aerosols is
predominantly controlled by the ventilation system, which acts to uniformly
distribute the aerosol concentration throughout the bus while simultaneously
diluting it with fresh air. The opening of doors and windows was found to
reduce the concentration by approximately one half, albeit its benefit does not
uniformly impact all passengers on the bus due to recirculation of airflow
caused by entrainment through windows. Finally, it was found that well fitted
surgical masks, when worn by both infected and susceptible passengers, can
nearly eliminate the transmission of the disease.

composing fault-tolerant and transactional stateful serverless functions. Beldi
runs on existing providers and lets developers write complex stateful
applications that require fault tolerance and transactional semantics without
the need to deal with tasks such as load balancing or maintaining virtual
machines. Beldi's contributions include extending the log-based fault-tolerant
approach in Olive (OSDI 2016) with new data structures, transaction protocols,
function invocations, and garbage collection. They also include adapting the
resulting framework to work over a federated environment where each serverless
function has sovereignty over its own data. We implement three applications on
Beldi, including a movie review service, a travel reservation system, and a
social media site. Our evaluation on 1,000 AWS Lambdas shows that Beldi's
approach is effective and affordable.

circumstellar dust. The star is a low-amplitude semi-regular pulsating

the the vertical extent of the VSI at 203 cells per scale height and allude at
what resolution per scale height we obtain convergence. Finally, we determine
the regions where EUV, FUV and X-Rays are dominant in the disk. We perform
global HD simulations using the PLUTO code. We adopt a global isothermal
accretion disk setup, 2.5D (2 dimensions, 3 components) which covers a radial

determine the 50 cells per scale height to be the lower limit to resolve the

the convergence for the saturation level of the kinetic energy. We are also
able to identify the growth of the `body' modes, with higher growth rate for
higher resolution. Full energy saturation and a turbulent steady state is
reached after 70 local orbits. We determine the location of the EUV-heated
region defined by the radial column density to be 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$ located
at $H_\mathrm{R}\sim9.7$, and the FUV/X-Rays-heated boundary layer defined by
10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ located at $H_\mathrm{R}\sim6.2$, making it necessary to
introduce the need of a hot atmosphere. For the first time, we report the
presence of small scale vortices in the r-Z plane, between the characteristic
layers of large scale vertical velocity motions. Such vortices could lead to
dust concentration, promoting grain growth. Our results highlight the
importance to combine photoevaporation processes in the future high-resolution

cluster of hardware security modules (HSMs) in order to provide security
guarantees that scale with the number of HSMs. In this way, SafetyPin protects
backed-up user data even against an attacker that can adaptively compromise
many of the system's constituent HSMs. SafetyPin provides this protection
without sacrificing scalability or fault tolerance. Decentralizing trust while
respecting the resource limits of today's HSMs requires a synthesis of

video observations, is that the immersion depth of the ball increases during
free fall due to capillary forces or vortex depression-in the absence of
buoyancy-and that the enormous excess pressure on the bottom of the ball during
impact drives the ball up towards its buoyancy equilibrium. The transfered
momentum is sufficient to expel the ball at high velocity, very similar to the
formation of liquid jets in collapsing cavities in liquids.

crucial to vast knowledge-rich applications, such as question answering and web

entity pairs to organize a ""universal"" taxonomy. However, these generic
taxonomies cannot satisfy user's specific interest in certain areas and
relations. Moreover, the nature of instance taxonomy treats each node as a
single word, which has low semantic coverage. In this paper, we propose a
method for seed-guided topical taxonomy construction, which takes a corpus and
a seed taxonomy described by concept names as input, and constructs a more
complete taxonomy based on user's interest, wherein each node is represented by
a cluster of coherent terms. Our framework, CoRel, has two modules to fulfill
this goal. A relation transferring module learns and transfers the user's
interested relation along multiple paths to expand the seed taxonomy structure
in width and depth. A concept learning module enriches the semantics of each
concept node by jointly embedding the taxonomy and text. Comprehensive
experiments conducted on real-world datasets show that Corel generates
high-quality topical taxonomies and outperforms all the baselines
significantly.

optimizing the placement of the Flying Access Points (FAPs), which establish

sources in time and space, so the cloud of particles (either in space or time)
is a discrete representation of the Green's function of an underlying PDE. As
such, each particle is a sample from the Green's function; therefore, each
particle should be distributed according to the Green's function. In short, the
kernel of a convolutional interpolation of the particle sample ""cloud"" should
be a replica of the cloud itself. This idea gives rise to an iterative method
by which the form of the kernel may be discerned in the process of
interpolating the Green's function. When the Green's function is a density,
this method is broadly applicable to interpolating a kernel density estimate

Delta, Gamma, and Speed. Then an exact solution is constructed in terms of all
higher order $S$-derivatives of the Black-Scholes formula. It is also shown
that the interacting Black-Scholes equation is invariant under a discrete
transformation that interchanges the interest rate with the mean of the
underlying asset and vice versa. This implies that the interacting
Black-Scholes equation can be written in a 'low energy' and a 'high energy'
form, in such a way that the high-interaction limit of the low energy form
corresponds to the weak-interaction limit of the high energy form. One can
apply a perturbative analysis to the high energy form to study the

constitutive property of the solid-liquid interface. Measurement of this slip
length is complicated by its small magnitude, expected in the nanometer range
based on molecular simulations. Here, we report an experimental technique that
interrogates the Navier slip length on individual nanoparticles immersed in
liquid, with sub-nanometer precision. Proof-of-principle experiments on
individual, citrate-stabilized, gold nanoparticles in water give a constant
slip length of 2.7$\pm$0.6 nm (95% C.I.) - independent of particle size.
Achieving this feature of size independence is central to any measurement of
this constitutive property, which is facilitated through the use of individual
particles of varying radii. This demonstration motivates studies that can now
validate the wealth of existing molecular simulation data on slip.

new class of algorithms for solving DR-MCO, namely a consecutive dual dynamic
programming (DDP) algorithm and a nonconsecutive version. The new algorithms
generalize and strengthen existing DDP-type algorithms by introducing an
important technique of regularization that enables the algorithms to handle
much broader classes of DR-MCO problems. In particular, the proposed algorithms
can safely handle fast growth of Lipschitz constants, a surprisingly prevalent
phenomenon in multistage optimization, as well as problems without relatively

the best of our knowledge, this is the first complexity analysis of DDP-type

dependence of the complexity of the DDP-type algorithms on the number of
stages, the dimension of the decision space, and various regularity
characteristics of DR-MCO. Numerical examples are also given to show the
effectiveness of the proposed regularization technique, namely the reduction of
the computation time or the number of subproblem oracle evaluations, and the

Subbase Theorem, which asserts that a topological space $X$ is compact if every
subbasic open cover of $X$ admits of a finite subcover. This is an easy
consequence of the Ultrafilter Theorem - whose proof depends upon Zorn's Lemma,
which is well known to be equivalent to the Axiom of Choice. Within this work,
we give a choice-free topological representation of orthocomplemented lattices

that our representation avoids use of Alexander's Subbase Theorem, along with
its associated nonconstructive choice principles. We then introduce a new
subclass of spectral spaces which we call \emph{upper Vietoris orthospaces} in
order to characterize (up to homeomorphism and isomorphism) the spectral space
of proper lattice filters used in our representation. It is then shown how our
constructions give rise to a choice-free dual equivalence of categories between

rotating millisecond magnetars are one of the leading models to explain
broad-lined Type Ic supernovae (SNe Ic-BL), and have been implicated as an
important source of metal enrichment in the early Universe. We investigate the
nucleosynthesis in such jet-driven hypernovae using a parameterised, but
physically motivated, approach that analytically relates an artificially
injected jet energy flux to the power available from the energy in differential
rotation in the proto-neutron star. We find ejected $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ masses
of $0.05\,\mathrm{M}_\odot - 0.45\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ in our most energetic
models with explosion energy $>10^{52}\,\mathrm{erg}$. This is in good
agreement with the range of observationally inferred values for SNe Ic-BL. The
$^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ is mostly synthesised in the shocked stellar envelope, and
is therefore only moderately sensitive to the jet composition. Jets with a high
electron fraction $Y_\mathrm{e}=0.5$ eject more $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ by a factor
of 2 than neutron-rich jets. We can obtain chemical abundance profiles in good
agreement with the average chemical signature observed in extremely metal-poor
(EMP) stars presumably polluted by hypernova ejecta. Notably, $\mathrm{[Zn/Fe]}
\gtrsim 0.5$ is consistently produced in our models. For neutron-rich jets,
there is a significant r-process component, and agreement with EMP star
abundances in fact requires either a limited contribution from neutron-rich
jets or a stronger dilution of r-process material in the interstellar medium
than for the slow SN ejecta outside the jet. The high $\mathrm{[C/Fe]}\gtrsim
0.7$ observed in many EMP stars cannot be consistently achieved due to the
large mass of iron in the ejecta, however, and remains a challenge for
jet-driven hypernovae based on the magneto-rotational mechanism.

using a fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FNDMC) approach, which is currently
the most reliable {\it ab initio} method in accounting for an electronic
correlation. Calculations utilizing the density functional theory (DFT) and the
coupled cluster method with single and double substitutions, including
noniterative triples (CCSD(T))are carried out alongside FNDMC for comparison.
Two families of basis sets are used to investigate the disiloxane linearisation
barrier - Dunning's correlation-consistent basis sets cc-pV$x$Z ($x = $ D, T,
and Q) and their core-valence correlated counterparts, cc-pCV$x$Z. It is
concluded that FNDMC successfully predicts the disiloxane linearisation barrier
and does not depend on the completeness of the basis sets as much as DFT or
CCSD(T), thus establishing its suitability.

they can perform automatic variable selection, aid interpretability, and
provide regularization. When fitting sparse models in a Bayesian framework,
however, analytically obtaining a posterior distribution over the parameters of
interest is intractable for all but the simplest cases. As a result
practitioners must rely on either sampling algorithms such as Markov chain
Monte Carlo or variational methods to obtain an approximate posterior. Mean
field variational inference is a particularly simple and popular framework that
is often amenable to analytically deriving closed-form parameter updates. When
all distributions in the model are members of exponential families and are
conditionally conjugate, optimization schemes can often be derived by hand.
Yet, I show that using standard mean field variational inference can fail to
produce sensible results for models with sparsity-inducing priors, such as the
spike-and-slab. Fortunately, such pathological behavior can be remedied as I
show that mixtures of exponential family distributions with non-overlapping
support form an exponential family. In particular, any mixture of a diffuse
exponential family and a point mass at zero to model sparsity forms an
exponential family. Furthermore, specific choices of these distributions
maintain conditional conjugacy. I use two applications to motivate these
results: one from statistical genetics that has connections to generalized
least squares with a spike-and-slab prior on the regression coefficients; and
sparse probabilistic principal component analysis. The theoretical results
presented here are broadly applicable beyond these two examples.

established by low energy EELS. The O-K spectra of the rocksalt phase are only
reproduced by a calculation for pure CoO and not for a model with random

200$^o$C, which is clearly related to the more Li-Co interdiffused phases, in

QED in such a curved spacetime at the 3-loop level using dimensional
regularization. The same applies to the case of QCD, in which we show that the
effective action can be summarized in the form of the reciprocal of a running
coupling constant squared described by the physical momentum. We also see that
the same holds for renormalizable quantum conformal gravity and that conformal

these assumptions do not always fit real datasets very well. A recent work
showed that the noise distribution could be learnt using a graph neural

this paper we propose a single-stage graph neural network that can robustly
perform rotation averaging in the presence of noise and outliers. Our method
uses all observations, suppressing outliers effects through the use of weighted

network that is faster, more robust and can be trained with less samples than

It is shown that although the optimized Tc in the electron-doped side is much
smaller than that in the hole-doped case, the electron- and hole-doped cuprate
superconductors rather resemble each other in the doping range of the
superconducting dome, indicating an absence of the disparity between the phase
diagrams of the electron- and hole-doped cuprate superconductors. In
particular, the anisotropic dressing of the electrons due to the strong

centered around the nodal region. Concomitantly, the dip in the peak-dip-hump

the corresponding peak in the quasiparticle scattering rate, while the
dispersion kink is always accompanied by the corresponding inflection point in

its authorial writing style. Sentence representation learning has been widely
explored in recent years and it has been shown that it improves the
generalization of different downstream tasks across many domains. Even though
utilizing probing methods in several studies suggests that these learned
contextual representations implicitly encode some amount of syntax, explicit
syntactic information further improves the performance of deep neural models in
the domain of authorship attribution. These observations have motivated us to
investigate the explicit representation learning of syntactic structure of
sentences. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework for learning
structural representations of sentences. The self-supervised network contains
two components; a lexical sub-network and a syntactic sub-network which take
the sequence of words and their corresponding structural labels as the input,
respectively. Due to the n-to-1 mapping of words to their structural labels,
each word will be embedded into a vector representation which mainly carries
structural information. We evaluate the learned structural representations of
sentences using different probing tasks, and subsequently utilize them in the
authorship attribution task. Our experimental results indicate that the
structural embeddings significantly improve the classification tasks when
concatenated with the existing pre-trained word embeddings.

high-resolution narrow-band images at Helium \textsc{i} 10830 \AA\ for the
chromosphere and EUV images at 171 \AA\ for the corona. We report following new
phenomena: 1) Repeated injections of chromospheric material shown as 10830 \AA\
absorption are squirted out from inter-granular lanes with the period of $\sim$
5 minutes. 2) EUV emissions are found to be periodically modulated with the
similar periods of $\sim$ 5 minutes. 3) Around the injection area where 10830
\AA\ absorption is enhanced, both EUV emissions and the strength of magnetic
field are remarkably stronger. 4) The peaks on the time profile of the EUV
emissions are found to be in sync with oscillatory peaks of the stronger
magnetic field in the region. These findings may give a series of strong
evidences supporting the scenario that coronal heating is powered by

property defines an intrinsic cutoff for liberated supergravities, which are
therefore effective theories valid only below energies that never exceed the

bounds shows that the new scalar potential terms allowed by liberated

a novel methodology that dramatically alleviates the curse of dimensionality.
We show that the sample complexity of the proposed methodology grows only
slightly in the dimensionality, even under model misspecification. We also

mass shift. The results are all in good agreement with those obtained by fully

solving large, sparse linear systems. The key to our approach is using low-rank
approximations to sparsify the separators in a Nested Dissection based
Householder QR factorization. First, a modified version of Nested Dissection is
used to identify interiors/separators and reorder the matrix. Then, classical
Householder QR is used to factorize the interiors, going from the leaves to the
root to the elimination tree. After every level of interior factorization, we
sparsify the remaining separators by using low-rank approximations. This
operation reduces the size of the separators without introducing any fill-in in
the matrix. However, it introduces a small approximation error which can be
controlled by the user. The resulting approximate factorization is stored as a
sequence of sparse orthogonal and sparse upper-triangular factors. Hence, it
can be applied efficiently to solve linear systems. Additionally, we further
improve the algorithm by using a block diagonal scaling. Then, we show a
systematic analysis of the approximation error and effectiveness of the
algorithm in solving linear systems. Finally, we perform numerical tests on
benchmark unsymmetric problems to evaluate the performance of the algorithm.
The factorization time scales as $\mathcal{O}(N \log N)$ and the solve time
scales as $\mathcal{O}(N)$.

functionality to connect quantum memories over long distances in fiber-based

frequencies, such as sum/difference frequency generation and four-wave mixing
Bragg scattering, are prone to broadband noise from the pump laser(s). To
address this issue, we propose to use third-order sum/difference frequency
generation (TSFG/TDFG) for an upconversion/downconversion QFC interface. In
this process, two pump photons combine their energy and momentum to mediate
frequency conversion across visible and telecom bands, bridging a large
spectral gap with long-wavelength pump pho-tons, which is particularly
beneficial from the noise perspective. We show that waveguide-coupled silicon
nitride microring resonators can be designed for efficient QFC between 606 nm

dispersion and coupling, and from the simulated parameters estimate that the
frequency conversion can be efficient (>80 %) at 50 mW pump power. Our results
suggest that microresonator-based TSFG/TDFG is promising for compact, scalable,

a way imperceptible to humans. Understanding the behavior of natural language
models under these attacks is crucial to better defend these models against
such attacks. In the black-box attack setting, where no access to model
parameters is available, the attacker can only query the output information
from the targeted model to craft a successful attack. Current black-box
state-of-the-art models are costly in both computational complexity and number

avoid suspicion towards an attacking agent. In this paper, we propose
Explain2Attack, a black-box adversarial attack on text classification task.
Instead of searching for important words to be perturbed by querying the target

12 putative densest structures over the $x - \alpha$ plane, where $x$ is the
relative concentration and $\alpha$ is the radius ratio of the small and large
spheres. To efficiently explore the DBSP, we develop an unbiased random search
approach based on both the piling up method to generate initial structures in
an unbiased way and the iterative balance method to optimize the volume of a
unit cell while keeping the overlap of hard spheres minimized. With those two
methods, we have discovered 12 putative DBSP and thereby the phase diagram is
updated, while our results are consistent with those of the previous study
[Hopkins et al., Phys. Rev. E 85, 021130 (2012)] with a small correction for
the case of 12 or fewer spheres in the unit cell. The 5 of the new 12 densest
packings are discovered in the small radius range of $0.42 \le \alpha \le 0.50$
where several structures are competitive to each other with respect to packing
fraction. Through the exhaustive search, diverse dense packings are discovered
and accordingly we find that packing structures achieve high packing fractions
by introducing distortion and/or combining a few local dense structural units.
Furthermore, we investigate the correspondence of the DBSP with crystals based
on the space group. The result shows that many structural units in real
crystals, e.g., $\mathrm{LaH_{10}}$ and $\mathrm{SrGe_{2-\delta}}$ being
high-pressure phases, can be understood as DBSP. The correspondence implies
that the densest sphere packings can be used effectively as structural
prototypes for searching complex crystal structures, especially for
high-pressure phases.

radio spectrum available to spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is
restricted to certain limited frequency intervals, there are many different
spaceborne SAR systems sharing common frequency bands. Due to this reason, it
is reported that two spaceborne SARs at orbit cross positions can potentially
cause severe mutual interference. Specifically, the transmitting signal of a
SAR, typically linear frequency modulated (LFM), can be directly received by
the side or back lobes of another SAR's antenna, causing radiometric artefacts
in the focused image. This paper tries to model and characterize the artefacts,
and study efficient methods for mitigating them. To this end, we formulate an
analytical model for describing the artefact, which reveals that the mutual
interference can introduce a two-dimensional LFM radiometric artefact in image
domain with a limited spatial extent. We show that the artefact is low-rank
based on range-azimuth decoupling analysis and two-dimensional high-order
Taylor expansion. Based on the low rank model, we show that two methods, i.e.,
principle component analysis and its robust variant, can be adopted to
efficiently mitigate the artefact via processing in image domain. The former
method has the advantage of fast processing speed, for example, a sub-swath of
Sentinel-1 interferometric wide swath image can be processed within 70 seconds
via block-wise operation, whereas the latter provides improved accuracy for
sparse point-like scatterers. Experiment results demonstrate that the
radiometric artefacts caused by mutual interference in Sentinel-1 level-1
images can be efficiently mitigated via the proposed methods.

binary system, VLA 1623Aab in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud in $^{12}$CO,
$^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O(2--1) lines. Our $^{12}$CO ($J$=2--1) data reveal that
the VLA 1623 outflow consists of twin spatially overlapped outflows/jets. The
redshifted northwestern jet exhibits the three cycles of wiggle with a spatial
period of 1360$\pm$10 au, corresponding to a time period of 180 yr. The
wiggle-like structure is also found in the position-velocity (PV) diagram,
showing an amplitude in velocity of about 0.9 km s$^{-1}$. Both the period and
the velocity amplitude of the wiggle are roughly consistent with those expected
from the binary parameters, i.e., the orbital period (460$\pm$20 yr) and the
Keplerian velocity (2.2 km s$^{-1}$). Our $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O images reveal
the nature of the dense gas in the two cm/mm sources, VLA 1623-B and -W, and
its relation to the outflows, and strongly support the previous interpretation
that both are shocked cloudlets. The driving sources of the twin molecular
outflows are, therefore, likely to be within the VLA 1623Aab binary. The axes
of the two molecular outflows are estimated to be inclined by 70$\arcdeg$ from
each other across the plane of sky, implying that the associated protostellar
disks are also misaligned by $70\arcdeg$. Such a misalignment, together with a
small binary separation of 34 au in the one of the youngest protobinary systems
known, is difficult to explain by models of disk fragmentation in quiescent
environments. Instead, other effects such as turbulence probably play roles in
misaligning the disks.

addition, a significant spectral component (~ 1%) is due to a sub-population of
hot carriers in an elevated thermal distribution. We have performed temperature

reveals the plasmon dephasing time, as well as the temperatures of the hot
carriers and the metal lattice, in order to correlate these parameters with
quantitative Raman analysis of chemical species adsorbed on metal surface.

quantum interferometry includes three stages: initialization, interrogation,

suitable periodic multiple-$\pi$-pulse sequence during the interrogation. Our
analytical results show that, by selecting suitable input states and readout
operations, the frequency and amplitude of an unknown alternating field can be
simultaneously extracted via population measurements. In particular, if we
input spin cat states and apply interaction-based readout operations, the

comprehensive understanding of threats and vulnerabilities within
organisations, as the degree of exposure is governed by the prevailing levels
of cyber-hygiene and established processes. A more accurate assessment of the
security provision informs on the most vulnerable environments that necessitate
more diligent management. The rapid proliferation in the automation of
cyber-attacks is reducing the gap between information and operational
technologies and the need to review the current levels of robustness against
new sophisticated cyber-attacks, trends, technologies and mitigation
countermeasures has become pressing. A deeper characterisation is also the
basis with which to predict future vulnerabilities in turn guiding the most
appropriate deployment technologies. Thus, refreshing established practices and
the scope of the training to support the decision making of users and
operators. The foundation of the training provision is the use of Cyber-Ranges
(CRs) and Test-Beds (TBs), platforms/tools that help inculcate a deeper
understanding of the evolution of an attack and the methodology to deploy the
most impactful countermeasures to arrest breaches. In this paper, an evaluation
of documented CR and TB platforms is evaluated. CRs and TBs are segmented by
type, technology, threat scenarios, applications and the scope of attainable
training. To enrich the analysis of documented CR and TB research and cap the
study, a taxonomy is developed to provide a broader comprehension of the future
of CRs and TBs. The taxonomy elaborates on the CRs/TBs different dimensions, as

four primary factors affecting the perceptibility of human eyes. Based on this

solution of an ODE (the fluid limit), with Gaussian fluctuations superimposed
upon it. In this paper we quantify the period of time during which this
Gaussian approximation remains precise, uniformly on the trajectory, in the
case where the fluid limit converges to an exponentially stable equilibrium
point. We provide a new coupling between the density-dependent chain and the
approximating Gaussian process, based on a construction of Kurtz using the
celebrated Koml{\'o}s-Major-Tusn{\'a}dy theorem for random walks. We show that
under mild hypotheses the time T(K) necessary for the strong approximation
error to reach a threshold $\epsilon$(K)<<1 is at least of order exp(V K

Two problems arise with this procedure. Firstly, experts need to be skilled and
still may not be able to find the optimal parametrization. Secondly, the
performance of the simulation model might not be able to be carried over to the
real world application due to model inaccuracies within the simulation. With
this contribution, we demonstrate on an industrial milling process how Bayesian
optimization can automate the tuning process and help to solve the mentioned
problems. Robust parametrization is ensured by perturbing the simulation with
arbitrarily distributed model plant mismatches. The objective is to minimize

optimization problem. A two stage min-max-type Bayesian optimization procedure
is developed and compared to benchmark algorithms in a simulation study of a

systems. Advancing the autonomy of such systems requires accurate
characterisation of sensor uncertainty. Vision includes intrinsic uncertainty
due to the camera sensor and extrinsic uncertainty due to environmental
lighting and texture, which propagate through the image processing algorithms
used to produce visual measurements. To faithfully characterise visual
measurements, we must take into account these uncertainties.
  In this paper, we propose a new class of likelihood functions that
characterises the uncertainty of the error distribution of two-frame optical
flow that enables a heteroscedastic dependence on texture. We employ the
proposed class to characterise the Farneback and Lucas Kanade optical flow
algorithms and achieve close agreement with their respective empirical error
distributions over a wide range of texture in a simulated environment. The
utility of the proposed likelihood model is demonstrated in a visual odometry
ego-motion study, which results in performance competitive with contemporary
methods. The development of an empirically congruent likelihood model advances
the requisite tool-set for vision-based Bayesian inference and enables sensor
data fusion with GPS, LiDAR and IMU to advance robust autonomous navigation.

dominated regime at low velocity towards a high velocity regime where the
string takes the form of a self-supporting loop. Here we show that this loop of
light string is not suspended in the air due to inertia, but through the
hydrodynamic drag exerted by the surrounding fluid, namely air. We investigate
this drag experimentally and theoretically for a smooth long cylinder moving
along its axis. We then derive the equations describing the shape of the string
loop in the limit of vanishing string radius. The solutions present a critical
point, analogous to a hydraulic jump, separating a supercritical zone where the
wave velocity is smaller than the rope velocity, from a subcritical zone where
waves propagate faster than the rope velocity. This property could be leveraged
to create a white hole analogue similar to what has been demonstrated using
surface waves on a flowing fluid. Loop solutions that are regular at the
critical point are derived, discussed and compared to the experiment. In the
general case, however, the critical point turns out to be the locus of a sharp
turn of the string, which is modelled theoretically as a discontinuity. The
hydrodynamic regularisation of this geometrical singularity, which involves
non-local and added mass effects, is discussed based on dimensional analysis.

We observe that at a finite temperature and low disorder strength, the failure
process, which nucleate in the absence of any thermal fluctuation, becomes
spatially uncorrelated when the applied stress is sufficiently low. The
dynamics of the model in this limit lies closely to the universality class of
ordinary percolation. When applied stress is increased beyond a threshold

identify the boundary between the localized and random failure process in the

of annotated data in order to achieve the desired level of performance. While
unlabelled data can be largely available and even abundant, annotation process
can be quite expensive and limiting. Under the assumption that some samples are
more important for a given task than others, active learning targets the
problem of identifying the most informative samples that one should acquire
annotations for. Instead of the conventional reliance on model uncertainty as a
proxy to leverage new unknown labels, in this work we propose a simple sample
selection criterion that moves beyond uncertainty. By first accepting the model
prediction and then judging its effect on the generalization error, we can
better identify wrongly predicted samples. We further present an approximation
to our criterion that is very efficient and provides a similarity based
interpretation. In addition to evaluating our method on the standard benchmarks
of active learning, we consider the challenging yet realistic scenario of
imbalanced data where categories are not equally represented. We show
state-of-the-art results and better rates at identifying wrongly predicted
samples. Our method is simple, model agnostic and relies on the current model
status without the need for re-training from scratch.

interactions remaining efficient until late times in the matter-dominated era
after recombination: the interaction among dark radiations (DR), and the
interaction between a small fraction of dark matter and dark radiation. The
dark sector consists of (1) a dominant component cold collisionless DM (DM1),
(2) a sub-dominant cold DM (DM2) and (3) a self-interacting DR. When a
sufficient amount of DR is ensured and a few percent of the total DM density is
contributed by DM2 interacting with DR, this set-up is known to be able to
resolve both the Hubble and $\sigma_{8}$ tension. In light of this, we propose
a scenario which is logically natural and has an intriguing theoretical
structure with a hidden unbroken gauge group ${\rm SU}(5)_{\rm X}\otimes {\rm
U}(1)_{\rm X}$. Our model of the dark sector does not introduce any new scalar
field, but contains only massless chiral fermions and gauge fields in the
ultraviolet (UV) regime. As such, it introduces a new scale (DM2 mass, $m_{\rm
DM2}$) based on the confinement resulting from the strong dynamics of ${\rm
SU}(5)_{\rm X}$. Both DM2-DR and DR-DR interactions are attributed to an
identical long range interaction of ${\rm U}(1)_{\rm X}$. We show that our
model can address the cosmological tensions when it is characterized by $g_{\rm

consuming. A general strategy uses an appropriate utility function to sample
the space to recommend the next optimal experiment or calculation within an
active learning loop. However, knowing what the optimal sampling strategy to
use to minimize the number of experiments is an outstanding problem. We compare
a number of strategies based on directed exploration on several materials
problems of varying complexity using a Kriging based model. These include one
dimensional curves such as the fatigue life curve for 304L stainless steel and
the Liquidus line of the Fe-C phase diagram, surfaces such as the Hartmann 3

four dimensional data set of experimental measurements for BaTiO3 based
ceramics. We also consider the effects of experimental noise on the Hartmann 3

better performance overall, converging faster across several data sets.
However, for certain problems, the trade-off methods incorporating exploitation
can perform at least as well, if not better than maximum variance. Thus, we
discuss how the choice of the utility function depends on the distribution of
the data, the model performance and uncertainties, additive noise as well as
the budget.

the decoherence suppression can be degraded with unavoidable delay times, by
analyzing non-Markovian average dynamics. We present analytical expressions for

factors describing the total radiant luminosity of the disk and the beam power
of the outflow are studied here. Four samples of sources including 576 LINERs,
100 classical double (FRII) radio sources, 80 relatively local AGN, and 103
measurements of four stellar mass X-ray binary systems, referred to as Galactic
Black Holes (GBH), are included in the study. All of the sources have highly
collimated outflows leading to compact radio emission or powerful extended
(FRII) radio emission. The properties of each of the full samples are explored,
as are those of the four individual GBH, and sub-types of the FRII and local
AGN samples. Source types and sub-types that have high, medium, and low values
of accretion rates and efficiency factors are identified and studied. A new
efficiency factor that describes the relative impact of black hole spin and
mass accretion rate on the beam power is defined and studied, and is found to
provide a new and interesting diagnostic. Mass accretion rates for 13 sources
and efficiency factors for 6 sources are compared with values obtained
independently, and indicate that similar values are obtained with independent
methods. The mass accretion rates and efficiency factors obtained here
substantially increase the number of values available, and improve our
understanding of their relationship to source types. The redshift dependence of
quantities is presented and the impact on the results is discussed.

  Optimization",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose a relaxation to the stochastic ruler method
originally described by Yan and Mukai in 1992 for asymptotically determining
the global optima of discrete simulation optimization problems. The `original'
version of the stochastic ruler and its variants require that a candidate for
the next estimate of the optimal solution pass a certain number of tests with
respect to the stochastic ruler to be selected as the next estimate of the
optimal solution. This requirement - that all tests need to be passed - can
lead to promising candidate solutions being rejected and can slow down the
convergence of the algorithm. Our proposed modification to the stochastic ruler
algorithm relaxes this requirement, and we show analytically that our proposed
variant of the stochastic ruler method incurs lesser computational overhead
when a new solution in the neighborhood of the current solution is a
`successful' candidate for the next estimate of the current solution. We then
show numerically that this can yield accelerated convergence to the optimal
solution via multiple numerical examples. We also provide the theoretical
grounding for the asymptotic convergence in probability of the variant to the
global optimal solution under the same set of assumptions as those underlying
the original stochastic ruler method.

interesting electronic and optical properties that arise in graphene and
transitional metal dichalcogenides. Similarly, novel and potentially useful

domains arranged in triangular superlattices with a large surface potential

thickness of the twisted hBN crystals. The observation is attributed to
interfacial elastic deformations that result in domains with a large density of
out-of-plane polarized dipoles formed by pairs of boron and nitrogen atoms

advanced models like BERT and GPT. However, Transformer and its existing

orders and relations of contexts. In this paper, we propose DA-Transformer,
which is a distance-aware Transformer that can exploit the real distance. We
propose to incorporate the real distances between tokens to re-scale the raw
self-attention weights, which are computed by the relevance between attention
query and key. Concretely, in different self-attention heads the relative
distance between each pair of tokens is weighted by different learnable
parameters, which control the different preferences on long- or short-term
information of these heads. Since the raw weighted real distances may not be
optimal for adjusting self-attention weights, we propose a learnable sigmoid
function to map them into re-scaled coefficients that have proper ranges. We
first clip the raw self-attention weights via the ReLU function to keep
non-negativity and introduce sparsity, and then multiply them with the
re-scaled coefficients to encode real distance information into self-attention.
Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that DA-Transformer can
effectively improve the performance of many tasks and outperform the vanilla
Transformer and its several variants.

IGWs are believed to supply the bulk of the wave energy for the lower solar
atmosphere, but their existence and role for the energy balance of the upper
layers is still unclear, largely due to the lack of knowledge about the
influence of the Sun's magnetic fields on their propagation. In this work, we
look at naturally excited IGWs in realistic models of the solar atmosphere and
study the effect of different magnetic field topographies on their propagation.
We carry out radiation-magnetohydrodynamic (R-MHD) simulations of a magnetic
field free and two magnetic models -- one with an initial, homogeneous,
vertical field of 100 G magnetic flux density and one with an initial
horizontal field of 100 G flux density. The propagation properties of IGWs are
studied by examining the phase-difference and coherence spectra in the
$k_{h}$-$\omega$ diagnostic diagram. We find that IGWs in the upper solar
atmosphere show upward propagation in the model with predominantly horizontal
field similar to the model without magnetic field. In contrast to that the
model with predominantly vertical fields show downward propagation. This
crucial difference in the propagation direction is also revealed in the
difference in energy transported by waves for heights below 0.8 Mm. Higher up,
the propagation properties show a peculiar behaviour, which require further
study. Our analysis suggests that IGWs may play a significant role in the
heating of the chromospheric layers of the internetwork region where horizontal
fields are thought to be prevalent.

photocount or theoretical photon-number distributions are derived using several
approaches. Relations among the derived criteria are revealed and the
fundamental criteria are identified. They are grouped into parametric systems
that allow the analysis of the non-classicality from different points of view
('local' non-classicality, pairwise character of photon correlations, etc.).
Considering their structure, the criteria may be divided into groups that
differ in the power to resolve the non-classicality. Quantification of the
non-classicality using the Lee non-classicality depth and the non-classicality
counting parameter is discussed. The used number of field's modes is identified
as an important parameter that may cause unexpected results. An appropriate
linear transformation of a photocount (photon-number) distribution into its
s-ordered form, needed for the determination of the non-classicality depth, is
derived. For comparison, the derived criteria are applied both to an
experimental photocount histogram of a twin beam and the reconstructed
photon-number distributions with different levels of the noise.

periods of 3.77 and 24.7 days. The external planet (LHS 1140 b) is a rocky
super-Earth that is located in the middle of the habitable zone of this
low-mass star, placing this system at the forefront of the habitable exoplanet
exploration. We further characterize this system by improving the physical and
orbital properties and search for additional planetary-mass components in the
system, also exploring the possibility of co-orbitals. We collected 113 new
radial velocity observations with ESPRESSO over a 1.5-year time span with an
average photon-noise precision of 1.07 m/s. We determine new masses with a
precision of 6% for LHS 1140 b ($6.48 \pm 0.46~M_{\oplus}$) and 9% for LHS 1140
c ($m_c=1.78 \pm 0.17~M_{\oplus}$), reducing by half the previously published
uncertainties. Although both planets have Earth-like bulk compositions, the
internal structure analysis suggests that LHS 1140 b might be iron-enriched. In
both cases, the water content is compatible to a maximum fraction of 10-12% in
mass, which is equivalent to a deep ocean layer of $779 \pm 650$ km for the
habitable-zone planet LHS 1140 b. Our results also provide evidence for a new
planet candidate in the system ($m_d= 4.8\pm1.1~M_{\oplus}$) on a ~78.9-day
orbital period, which is detected through three independent methods. The
analysis also allows us to discard other planets above 0.5 $M_{\oplus}$ for
periods shorter than 10 days and above 2 $M_{\oplus}$ for periods up to one
year. Finally, our analysis discards co-orbital planets of LHS 1140 b down to 1
$M_{\oplus}$. Indications for a possible co-orbital signal in LHS 1140 c are
detected in both radial velocity and photometric data, however. The new

many natural contexts, such as the Earth's magnetopause and the solar wind. The
collisionless nature of involved plasmas requires a kinetic description. When
the width of the shear layer is of the order of ion scales, the Hybrid
Vlasov-Maxwell approach can be adopted. Aims. The aim of the paper is to derive
explicit forms for stationary configurations of magnetized plasmas with planar
shearing flows,within the Hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell description. Two configurations
are considered: the first with a uniform magnetic field obliquely directed with
respect to the bulk velocity; and the second with a uniform-magnitude
variable-direction magnetic field. Methods. Stationary ion distribution
functions are obtained by combining single-particle constant of motions, which
are derived studying particle dynamics. Preliminary information about the form
of the distribution functions are analytically derived considering a local
approximation for the background electromagnetic field. Then, a numerical
method is set up to obtain a solution for general profiles. Results. The
explicit distribution functions that are found allow to obtain profiles of
density, bulk velocity, temperature and heat flux. Anisotropy and agyrotropy in
the distribution function are also evaluated. Stationarity of the solution
during numerical simulations is checked in the uniform oblique magnetic field
case. Conclusions. The considered configurations can be used as models for the
Earth's magnetopause in simulations of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability.

contrast and a hot spot shifted eastward of the substellar point. This was
confirmed by numerous phase curve observations probing the longitudinal
brightness variation of the atmosphere. Global circulation models, however,
systematically underestimate the phase curve amplitude and overestimate the
shift of its maximum. We use a global circulation model including non-grey
radiative transfer and realistic gas and cloud opacities to systematically
investigate how the atmospheric circulation of hot Jupiters varies with
equilibrium temperature from 1000 to 2200K. We show that the heat transport is
very efficient for cloudless planets cooler than 1600K and becomes less
efficient at higher temperatures. When nightside clouds are present, the
day-to-night heat transport becomes extremely inefficient, leading to a good
match to the observed low nightside temperatures. The constancy of this low
temperature is, however, due to the strong dependence of the radiative
timescale with temperature. We further show that nightside clouds increase the
phase curve amplitude and decreases the phase curve offset at the same time.
This change is very sensitive to the cloud chemical composition and particle
size, meaning that the diversity in observed phase curves can be explained by a
diversity of nightside cloud properties. Finally, we show that phase curve
parameters do not necessarily track the day/night contrast nor the shift of the
hot spot on isobars, and propose solutions to to recover the true hot-spot
shift and day/night contrast.

include simplified temperature-dependent clouds with radiative feedback and
show how different cloud compositions, vertical thicknesses, and opacities
shape hot Jupiters atmospheres by potentially increasing planetary albedos,
decreasing photospheric pressures and nightside temperatures, and in some cases
producing strong dayside thermal inversions. With decreasing irradiation,
clouds progressively form on the nightside and cooler western limb followed by
the eastern limb and central dayside. We find that clouds significantly modify
the radiative transport and affect the observable properties of planets colder
than T_irr ~ 3,000~K (T_eq~2,100 K) depending on the clouds' vertical extent.
The precise strength of expected effects depends on the assumed parameters, but
trends in predicted phase curves emerge from an ensemble of simulations. Clouds
lead to larger phase curve amplitudes and smaller phase curve offsets at IR
wavelengths, compared to cloud-free models. At optical wavelengths, we predict
mostly westward phase curve offsets at intermediate temperatures (T_irr ~ 2,000
- 3,500 K) with clouds confined to the nightside and western limb. If clouds
are vertically compact (i.e. on order of a pressure scale height in thickness),

across all cities under consideration. We are able to analytically show that
this exponential distribution of neighbourhood sizes is consistent with the
observed Zipf's Law for city sizes. We attempt to explain the emergence of
exponential decay in neighbourhood size using a model of neighborhood dynamics
where migration into and movement within the city are mediated by wealth. We
find that, as observed empirically, the model generates exponential decay in
neighborhood size distributions for a range of parameter specifications. The
use of a comparative wealth-based metric to assess the relative attractiveness
of a neighborhood combined with a stringent affordability threshold in
mediating movement within the city are found to be necessary conditions for the
the emergence of the exponential distribution. While an analytical treatment is
difficult due to the globally coupled dynamics, we use a simple
two-neighbourhood system to illustrate the precise dynamics yielding
equilibrium non-equal neighborhood size distributions.

in machine learning due to its potential to significantly enhance our ability
to understand physical systems. However, the dynamics of many real-world
systems are challenging to learn due to the presence of nonlinear potentials
and a number of interactions that scales quadratically with the number of
particles $N$, as in the case of the N-body problem. In this work, we introduce
an approach that transforms a fully-connected interaction graph into a
hierarchical one which reduces the number of edges to $O(N)$. This results in
linear time and space complexity while the pre-computation of the hierarchical
graph requires $O(N\log (N))$ time and $O(N)$ space. Using our approach, we are
able to train models on much larger particle counts, even on a single GPU. We
evaluate how the phase space position accuracy and energy conservation depend
on the number of simulated particles. Our approach retains high accuracy and
efficiency even on large-scale gravitational N-body simulations which are
impossible to run on a single machine if a fully-connected graph is used.
Similar results are also observed when simulating Coulomb interactions.
Furthermore, we make several important observations regarding the performance
of this new hierarchical model, including: i) its accuracy tends to improve
with the number of particles in the simulation and ii) its generalisation to
unseen particle counts is also much better than for models that use all
$O(N^2)$ interactions.

structure and the fact that we do not use any fully-connected layers or 3D
convolutions leads to a very lightweight network. The output of this network is
used in order to calculate matching costs and create a cost-volume. Instead of
using time and memory-inefficient cost-aggregation methods such as semi-global

on filtering techniques, namely median filter and guided filter. By computing a
left-right consistency check we get rid of inconsistent values. Afterwards we
use a watershed foreground-background segmentation on the disparity image with
removed inconsistencies. This mask is then used to refine the final prediction.

Brownian Motion with reallocation (RGBM) and explore both transient and
persistent poverty over 1952-2006. We find that annual transitions in and out
of poverty are common and show a rising trend, with the rise largely being
driven by transitions out of poverty. Despite this promising trend, even toward
the end of the time frame, there is a non-trivial proportion of individuals
still transitioning annually into poverty, indicative of the economic fragility
of those near the poverty line. We also find that there is still a marked
persistence of poverty over time, though the probability of poverty persistence
is slowly declining. Particularly concerning in this context are the poverty
trajectories of those at the very bottom of the income distribution. The choice
of poverty line appears to impact the dynamics, with higher poverty lines
corresponding to lower transitions and higher persistence probabilities. The
distinct nature of emergent transient and persistence dynamics suggests that
the approaches to counter these phenomena need to be different, possibly
incorporating both missing financial markets and state action.

range of electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their
low toxicity, high abundance and rich redox chemistry. While many previous
studies focused on the activity of these materials, a better understanding of
the material transformations relating to activation or degradation is highly
desirable, both from a scientific perspective and for applications. We
electrodeposited Na-containing MnOx without long-range order from an alkaline
solution to investigate these aspects by cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron
microscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Mn-K and Mn-L edges. The
pristine film was assigned to a layered edge-sharing Mn3+/4+ oxide with Mn-O
bond lengths of mainly 1.87 {\AA} and some at 2.30 {\AA} as well as Mn-Mn bond
lengths of 2.87 {\AA} based on fits to the extended x-ray fine structure. The
decrease of the currents at voltages before the onset of the OER followed power
laws with three different exponents depending on the number of cycles and the
Tafel slope decreases from 186 \pm 48 to 114 \pm 18 mV dec-1 after 100 cycles,
which we interpret in the context of surface coverage with unreacted
intermediates. Post-mortem microscopy and bulk spectroscopy at the Mn-K edge
showed no change of the microstructure, bulk local structure or bulk Mn
valence. Yet, the surface region of MnOx oxidized toward Mn4+, which explains
the reduction of the currents in agreement with literature. Surprisingly, we
find that MnOx reactivates after 30 min at open-circuit (OC), where the
currents and also the Tafel slope increase. Reactivation processes during OC
are crucial because OC is unavoidable when coupling the electrocatalysts to
intermittent power sources such as solar energy for sustainable energy
production.

a narrow Fe/GaAs (001) stripe generates an Oersted field as well as SOFs due to
the reduced symmetry at the Fe/GaAs interface, and excites standing spin wave
(SSW) modes because of the lateral confinement. Due to their different
symmetries, the SOFs and the Oersted field generate distinctly different mode
patterns. Thus it is possible to determine the magnitude of the SOFs from an
analysis of the shape of the SSW patterns. Specifically, this method, which is
conceptually different from previous approaches based on lineshape analysis, is

performing a Galerkin projection based on a fully (space and time) discrete
full order model (FOM) formulation. This 'discretize-then-project' approach
requires no pressure stabilization technique (even though the pressure term is
present in the ROM) nor a boundary control technique (to impose the boundary
conditions at the ROM level). These are two main advantages compared to
existing approaches. The fully discrete FOM is obtained by a finite volume
discretization of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on a collocated
grid, with a forward Euler time discretization. Two variants of the time
discretization method, the inconsistent and consistent flux method, have been
investigated. The latter leads to divergence-free velocity fields, also on the
ROM level, whereas the velocity fields are only approximately divergence-free
in the former method. For both methods, accurate results have been obtained for
test cases with different types of boundary conditions: a lid-driven cavity and
an open-cavity (with an inlet and outlet). The ROM obtained with the consistent
flux method, having divergence-free velocity fields, is slightly more accurate
but also slightly more expensive to solve compared to the inconsistent flux
method. The speedup ratio of the ROM and FOM computation times is the highest
for the open cavity test case with the inconsistent flux method.

At A.I. Alikhanyan National Science Laboratory (Yerevan Physics Institute), an
activity is underway to develop a technology for producing the 99mTc isotope by
irradiating a molybdenum target of 100Mo, pressed into a titanium base, with a
proton beam of a C18 cyclotron [3,4,5]. One of the limitations of this
technique is the utilization of heat released in the target as a result of
proton energy loss [6,7]. The task of this work was the improvement of the
thermal regime of a standard target for the C18 cyclotron due to a series of
parallel grooves. Heat transfer experiments with prototypes of targets were
carried out on a specially made test bench providing water cooling of its back
side. A special Plexiglas thermal block was made to study the thermal processes
in the target. The measurement results show that the above mentioned technique
of processing the base of the target leads to a significant increase in the
rate of cooling of the target, which will allow to irradiate at significantly
higher proton beam intensities, which in its turn will increase the irradiation
efficiency and reduce the cost of the final product.

toughness. A layered material is considered as a modelling system.
  An elastic-plastic phase-field model and a surfing boundary condition are
used to study how the crack propagates throughout the material and the
evolution of the effective toughness as a function of the layer angle. We first
study three idealized situations, where only one property among fracture
toughness, Young's modulus and yield strength is heterogeneous whereas the
others are uniform. We observe that in the case of toughness and strength
heterogeneity, the material exhibits anomalous isotropy: the effective
toughness is equal to the largest of the point-wise values for any layer angle
except when the layers are parallel to the macroscopic direction of
propagation. As the layer angle decreases, the crack propagates along the
brittle-to-tough interfaces, whereas it goes straight when the layers have
different yield strength but uniform toughness. We find that smooth deflections
in the crack path do not induce any overall toughening and that the effective
toughness is not proportional to either the cumulated fracture energy or the
cumulated plastic work. In the case of elastic heterogeneity, the material is
anisotropic in the sense of the effective toughness, as the latter varies as a
function of the layer angle. Four toughening mechanisms are active: stress
fluctuations, crack renucleation, plastic dissipation and plastic blunting.
Finally, we consider a layered medium comprised of compliant-tough-weak and
stiff-brittle-strong phases, as it is the case for many structural composites.
We observe a transition from an interface-dominated to a plasticity-dominated
failure regime, as the phase constituents become more ductile. The material is
anisotropic in the sense of the effective toughness.

  This paper presents a first step in answering that question. We describe
NeuralDB, a database system with no pre-defined schema, in which updates and

  We begin by demonstrating that at the core, recent NLP transformers, powered
by pre-trained language models, can answer select-project-join queries if they
are given the exact set of relevant facts. However, they cannot scale to
non-trivial databases and cannot perform aggregation queries. Based on these
findings, we describe a NeuralDB architecture that runs multiple Neural SPJ
operators in parallel, each with a set of database sentences that can produce
one of the answers to the query. The result of these operators is fed to an
aggregation operator if needed. We describe an algorithm that learns how to
create the appropriate sets of facts to be fed into each of the Neural SPJ
operators. Importantly, this algorithm can be trained by the Neural SPJ
operator itself. We experimentally validate the accuracy of NeuralDB and its
components, showing that we can answer queries over thousands of sentences with

respectively. We found an EHB star (Teff ~ 17,000 K) with the radius lies
between the BHB and normal EHB stars. The most peculiar of our EHB stars (Teff

(Teff ~ 7,000 K), which is an important target for spectroscopic study. This
discovery of the candidate EHB+BSS binary system, could help to explain the
mass loss in the RGB phase, leading to the formation of EHB stars.

follow a two-stage procedure to sequentially estimate the channel parameters,
while for the hybrid RIS we estimate the individual channels at the RIS based
on the observations from active RIS elements assuming alternating uplink and

to generate linear polarization observable in stars and planets atmospheres,

Generation of linear SP can typically be reached more easily than circular SP.
Interestingly, the later is often absent in observations and theories.
Intrigued by this, we propose to demonstrate how circular SP can be created by
anisotropic collisions if a magnetic field is present. We also demonstrate how
anisotropic collisions can result in the creation of circular SP if the
radiation field is anisotropic. We show that under certain conditions, linear
SP creation is accompanied by the emergence of circular SP which can be useful
for diagnostics of solar and astrophysical plasmas. We treat an example and
calculate the density matrix elements of tensorial order $k\!=\!1$ which are
directly associated with the presence of circular SP. This work should
encourage theoretical and observational research to be increasingly oriented
towards circular SP profiles in addition to linear SP in order to improve our

ice structure upon reactivity under soft UV irradiation conditions. Mixtures of
PAHs with amorphous solid water (porous and compact) and crystalline (cubic and
hexagonal) ices were prepared in a high vacuum chamber and irradiated using a
mercury lamp for up to 2.5 hours. The results show that the production of
oxygenated PAHs is efficient only in amorphous water ice, while fragmentation
can occur in both amorphous and crystalline ices. We conclude that the
reactivity is driven by PAH-water interactions in favourable geometries,
notably where dangling bonds are available at the surface of pores. These
results suggest that the formation of oxygenated PAH molecules is most likely
to occur in interstellar environments with porous (or compact) amorphous solid
water and that this reactivity could considerably influence the inventory of

circular. We examine linear kink oscillations in straight, density-enhanced,
magnetic cylinders with elliptical cross-sections by solving the
three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic equations from an initial-value-problem
perspective. Motivated by relevant eigen-mode analyses, we distinguish between
two independent polarizations, one along the major axis (the M-modes) and the
other along the minor one (the m-modes). We find that, as happens for coronal
loops with circular cross-sections, the apparent damping of the transverse
displacement of the loop axis is accompanied by the accumulation of transverse
Alfv\'enic motions and the consequent development of small-scales therein,
suggesting the robustness of the concepts of resonant absorption and
phase-mixing. In addition, two stages can in general be told apart in the
temporal evolution of the loop displacement; a Gaussian time dependence
precedes an exponential one. For the two examined density ratios between loops
and their surroundings, the periods of the M-modes (m-modes) tend to increase
(decrease) with the major-to-minor-half-axis ratio, and the damping times in
the exponential stage for the M-modes tend to exceed their m-mode counterparts.
This is true for the two transverse profiles we examine. However, the relative
magnitudes of the damping times in the exponential stage for different
polarizations depend on the specification of the transverse profile and/or the
density contrast. The applications of our numerical findings are discussed in
the context of coronal seismology.

performance in the context of estimating the density of stromal tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) in breast cancer. Methods: We digitized 64
glass slides of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained ductal carcinoma core biopsies
prepared at a single clinical site. We created training materials and workflows
to crowdsource pathologist image annotations on two modes: an optical
microscope and two digital platforms. The workflows collect the ROI type, a
decision on whether the ROI is appropriate for estimating the density of sTILs,
and if appropriate, the sTIL density value for that ROI. Results: The pilot
study yielded an abundant number of cases with nominal sTIL infiltration.
Furthermore, we found that the sTIL densities are correlated within a case, and
there is notable pathologist variability. Consequently, we outline plans to
improve our ROI and case sampling methods. We also outline statistical methods
to account for ROI correlations within a case and pathologist variability when
validating an algorithm. Conclusion: We have built workflows for efficient data
collection and tested them in a pilot study. As we prepare for pivotal studies,
we will consider what it will take for the dataset to be fit for a regulatory
purpose: study size, patient population, and pathologist training and
qualifications. To this end, we will elicit feedback from the FDA via the
Medical Device Development Tool program and from the broader digital pathology
and AI community. Ultimately, we intend to share the dataset, statistical
methods, and lessons learned.

is aimed at combining detection and reconstruction of correlational and
quasi-periodic motifs in the viral genomic RNA/DNA sequences. The motifs
reconstructed by TAMGI are robust with respect to indels and point mutations
and can be tried as putative therapeutic targets. We developed and tested the
relevant theory and statistical criteria for TAMGI applications. The
applications of TAMGI are illustrated by the study of motifs in the genomes of
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2
(the latter coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 being responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic)
packaged within filament-like helical capsid. Such ribonucleocapsid is
transported into spherical membrane envelope with incorporated spike
glycoproteins. Two other examples concern the genomes of viruses with
icosahedral capsids, satellite tobacco mosaic virus (STMV) and bacteriophage
PHIX174. A part of the quasi-periodic motifs in these viral genomes was evolved
due to weakly specific cooperative interaction between genomic ssRNA/ssDNA and
nucleocapsid proteins. The symmetry of the capsids leads to the natural
selection of specific quasi-periodic motifs in the related genomic sequences.
Generally, TAMGI provides a convenient tool for the study of numerous molecular
mechanisms with participation of both quasi-periodic motifs and complete
repeats, the genome organization, contextual analysis of cis/trans regulatory
elements, data mining, and correlations in the genomic sequences.

representations, yielding low reconstruction error. In particular, the latest
works represent the target shape as an atlas of multiple mappings, which can
closely encode object parts. Atlas representations, however, suffer from one
major drawback: The individual mappings are not guaranteed to be consistent,
which results in holes in the reconstructed shape or in jagged surface areas.
  We introduce an approach that explicitly encourages global consistency of the
local mappings. To this end, we introduce two novel loss terms. The first term
exploits the surface normals and requires that they remain locally consistent
when estimated within and across the individual mappings. The second term
further encourages better spatial configuration of the mappings by minimizing
novel stitching error. We show on standard benchmarks that the use of normal
consistency requirement outperforms the baselines quantitatively while
enforcing better stitching leads to much better visual quality of the
reconstructed objects as compared to the state-of-the-art.

consensus algorithm entail a dynamic fault model that implies that the active
validators (nodes that sign blocks) may change over time, and a quorum of these
validators is assumed to be correct only for a limited period of time (called
trusting period). The changes of the validator set are under control of the
blockchain application, and are committed in every block. In order to check
what is the state of the blockchain application at some height h, one needs to
know the validator set at that height so that one can verify the corresponding
digital signatures and hashes. A naive way of determining the validator set for

by checking digital signatures and hashes and (iii) execute the corresponding
transactions so the changes in the validator sets are reproduced. This can
potentially be very slow and computationally and data intensive.

describe a light client protocol that allows to check the state of the

amount of data needed to be downloaded, and the number of required
computationally expensive signature verification operations. In addition to
mathematical proofs, we have formalized the light client protocol in TLA+, and

Increasing the wavenumber increases the rate of decay in both regimes, but this
effect is much weaker than for the usual turbulent diffusion of passive
scalars, where the increase is quadratic for small wavenumbers. The turbulent
decay is well described by an enhanced Newtonian cooling process in the
optically thin limit, which is found to show a weak increase proportional to
the square root of the wavenumber. In the optically thick limit, the increase
in turbulent decay is somewhat steeper for wavenumbers below the
energy-carrying wavenumber of the turbulence, but levels off toward larger
wavenumbers. In the presence of turbulence, the typical cooling time is
comparable to the turbulent turnover time. We observe that the temperature
takes a long time to reach equilibrium in both the optically thin and thick

powerful criterion to discriminate between different regularization and

  schemes",,,,"cs.IT cs.NI cs.RO math.IT","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The performance optimization of UAV communication systems requires the joint
design of UAV trajectory and communication efficiently. To tackle the challenge
of infinite design variables arising from the continuous-time UAV trajectory
optimization, a commonly adopted approach is by approximating the UAV
trajectory with piecewise-linear path segments in three-dimensional (3D) space.
However, this approach may still incur prohibitive computational complexity in
practice when the UAV flight period/distance becomes long, as the distance
between consecutive waypoints needs to be kept sufficiently small to retain
high approximation accuracy. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose in
this paper a new and general framework for UAV trajectory and communication
co-design. First, we propose a flexible path discretization scheme that
optimizes only a number of selected waypoints (designable waypoints) along the
UAV path for complexity reduction, while all the designable and non-designable
waypoints are used in calculating the approximated communication utility along
the UAV trajectory for ensuring high trajectory discretization accuracy. Next,
given any number of designable waypoints, we propose a novel path compression
scheme where the UAV 3D path is first decomposed into three one-dimensional
(1D) sub-paths and each sub-path is then approximated by superimposing a number
of selected basis paths weighted by their corresponding path coefficients, thus
further reducing the path design complexity. Finally, we provide a case study
on UAV trajectory design for aerial data harvesting from distributed ground
sensors, and numerically show that the proposed schemes can significantly
reduce the UAV trajectory design complexity yet achieve favorable rate
performance as compared to conventional path/time discretization schemes.

reproduces the macroscopic dynamics of the network in terms of the firing rate

facilitation and depression integrate each other to efficiently mimic WM
operations via either synaptic reactivation or persistent activity. Memory
access and loading are associated to stimulus-locked transient oscillations
followed by a steady-state activity in the $\beta-\gamma$ band, thus resembling
what observed in the cortex during vibrotactile stimuli in humans and object
recognition in monkeys. Memory juggling and competition emerge already by
loading only two items. However more items can be stored in WM by considering
neural architectures composed of multiple excitatory populations and a common
inhibitory pool. Memory capacity depends strongly on the presentation rate of
the items and it maximizes for an optimal frequency range. In particular we
provide an analytic expression for the maximal memory capacity. Furthermore,
the mean membrane potential turns out to be a suitable proxy to measure the
memory load, analogously to event driven potentials in experiments on humans.

users must trust their cloud provider with the confidentiality and integrity of

AMD introduced SEV, a hardware feature which aims to protect code and data in a
virtual machine. This allows to store and process sensitive data in cloud
environments without the need to trust the cloud provider or the underlying
software. However, the virtual machine still depends on the hypervisor for
performing certain activities, such as the emulation of special CPU
instructions, or the emulation of devices. Yet, most code that runs in virtual
machines was not written with an attacker model which considers the hypervisor
as malicious. In this work, we introduce a new class of attacks in which a
malicious hypervisor manipulates external interfaces of an SEV or SEV-ES
virtual machine to make it act against its own interests. We start by showing
how we can make use of virtual devices to extract encryption keys and secret
data of a virtual machine. We then show how we can reduce the entropy of
probabilistic kernel defenses in the virtual machine by carefully manipulating
the results of the CPUID and RDTSC instructions. We continue by showing an
approach for secret data exfiltration and code injection based on the forgery
of MMIO regions over the VM's address space. Finally, we show another attack
which forces decryption of the VM's stack and uses Return Oriented Programming
to execute arbitrary code inside the VM. While our approach is also applicable
to traditional virtualization environments, its severity significantly
increases with the attacker model of SEV-ES, which aims to protect a virtual
machine from a benign but vulnerable hypervisor.

with long-range pairing terms and in the presence of an Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper
on-site potential. Specifically, we consider algebraically decaying
superconducting pairing amplitudes; the exponent of this decay is found to
determine a critical pairing strength, below which the chain remains
topologically trivial. Above the critical pairing, topological edge modes are
observed in the central gap. For sufficiently fast decay of the pairing, these
modes are identified as Majorana zero-modes. However, if the pairing term
decays slowly, the modes become massive Dirac modes. Interestingly, these
massive modes still exhibit a true level crossing at zero energy, which points
towards an initimate relation to Majorana physics. We also observe a clear lack
of bulk-boundary correspondence in the long-range system, where bulk
topological invariants remain constant, while dramatic changes appear in the
behavior at the edge of the system. In addition to the central gap around zero
energy, the Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper potential also leads to other energy gaps at
non-zero energy. As for the analogous short-range model, the edge modes in
these gaps can be characterized through a 2D Chern invariant. However, in
contrast to the short-range model, this topological invariant does not
correspond to the number of edge mode crossings anymore. This provides another
example for the weakening of the bulk-boundary correspondence occurring in this
model. Finally, we discuss possible realizations of the model with ultracold
atoms and condensed matter systems.

stacking pattern and explore the possible existence of an LPSO phase as an
intermediate between the $\gamma$ and $\epsilon$ phases, the phase stability of
various structural polytypes of iron was examined using first-principles
calculations with a spin-polarized form of the generalized gradient
approximation in density functional theory. We found that an antiferromagnetic
ordered 6H$_2$ structure is the most stable among the candidate LPSO structures
and is energetically close to the $\epsilon$ phase, which suggests that the
observed LPSO-like phase adopts the 6H$_2$ structure. Furthermore, we
determined that the phase stability can be attributed to the valley depth in
the density of states, close to the Fermi level.

of hysteresis of $V_x$ while increasing and decreasing the driving force
monotonically. When the depth of the substrate is shallow, there are two
continuous phase transitions. When the potential well depth slightly increases,
the phase transition from the pinned to the disordered plastic flow states is
continuous; however, the phase transition from the disordered plastic flow to
the moving ordered states is discontinuous. When the substrate is even deeper,
the phase transition from the pinned to the disordered plastic flow states
changes to discontinuous. When the substrate further increases, as the driving
force increases, the pinned state changes to the moving ordered state directly,

hints at periodic physical processes that result in emission. CTA 102, a flat
spectrum radio quasar at $z=1.032$, has displayed significant activity since
2016. The multi-waveband light curve of CTA 102 shows signs of quasi-periodic
oscillations during the 2016-2017 flare. Our goal is to quantify the presence
of any periodicity in the emitted flux during the mentioned period and to
explore the causes that can give rise to it. Techniques such as the
Lomb-Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet z-transform were employed to
observe the power emitted at different frequencies. To quantify the
significance of the dominant period, Monte-Carlo techniques were employed
considering an underlying smooth bending power-law model for the power
spectrum. In addition, the light curve was modeled using an autoregressive
process to analytically obtain the significance of the dominant period. Lastly,
the light curve was modeled using a generalized autoregressive integrated
moving average process to check whether introducing a periodic component
results in a statistically preferable model. Significant, simultaneous
quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were observed in the $\gamma$-ray and
optical fluxes of blazar CTA 102 during its 2016-2017 flare. The periodic flux
modulation had a dominant period of $\sim$ 7.6 days and lasted for $\sim$ 8
cycles (MJD 57710-57770). All of the methods used point toward significant
($>4\sigma$) quasi-periodic modulation in both $\gamma$-ray and optical fluxes.
Several possible models were explored while probing the origin of the

extension of auto-regressive processes using statistics which summarise the
recent past dynamics of time series. The result of our research is a novel
framework called VEST, designed to perform feature engineering using univariate

present a graph neural network (GNN) framework, to describe functional
interactions based on the structural anatomical layout. A GNN allows us to
process graph-structured spatio-temporal signals, providing a possibility to
combine structural information derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with
temporal neural activity profiles, like observed in functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, dynamic interactions between different
brain regions learned by this data-driven approach can provide a multi-modal
measure of causal connectivity strength. We assess the proposed model's
accuracy by evaluating its capabilities to replicate empirically observed
neural activation profiles, and compare the performance to those of a vector
auto regression (VAR), like typically used in Granger causality. We show that
GNNs are able to capture long-term dependencies in data and also
computationally scale up to the analysis of large-scale networks. Finally we
confirm that features learned by a GNN can generalize across MRI scanner types

models are widely used in materials science and structural biology. Since
electron scattering is dominated by the nuclear cores, the scattering potential
is typically described by the widely applied independent atom model. This
approximation is fast and fairly accurate, especially for scanning TEM (STEM)
annular dark-field contrast, but it completely neglects valence bonding and its
effect on the transmitting electrons. However, an emerging trend in electron
microscopy is to use new instrumentation and methods to extract the maximum
amount of information from each electron. This is evident in the increasing
popularity of techniques such as 4D-STEM combined with ptychography in
materials science, and cryogenic microcrystal electron diffraction in
structural biology, where subtle differences in the scattering potential may be
both measurable and contain additional insights. Thus, there is increasing
interest in electron scattering simulations based on electrostatic potentials
obtained from first principles, mainly via density functional theory, which was
previously mainly required for holography. In this Review, we discuss the
motivation and basis for these developments, survey the pioneering work that
has been published thus far, and give our outlook for the future. We argue that
a physically better justified $\textit{ab initio}$ description of the

it is investigated how a scalar charged test particle is affected by the vacuum
fluctuations of a massive scalar field in D+1 spacetime when the background
evolves from empty space to a thermal bath, and also when a perfectly
reflecting boundary is included. It is shown that when the particle is brought
into a thermal bath it gains an amount of energy by means of positive
dispersions of its velocity components. The magnitude of this effect is
dependent on the temperature and also on the field mass. However, when a
reflecting wall is inserted, dispersions can be positive or negative, showing
that subvacuum effect happens even in a finite temperature environment.
Furthermore, a remarkable result is that temperature can even improve negative
velocity fluctuations. The magnitude of the residual effects depends on the
switching interval of time the system takes to evolve between two states.

kinetic energy ($TKE$) within mangrove forest considering flexible canopies and
rigid stems under various wave conditions. Canopies and stems have different
effects on turbulence generation. The flexible leaves in canopy scale can
promote the dissipation of $TKE$ and the rigid stem scale contribute to the
generation of turbulence. Importantly, the difference of $TKE$ with and without
vegetation, $\Delta TKE$ varied with wave frequency and peaked at 0.833 Hz for
the canopy and vegetation-free upper layer, but increased with wave frequency
in stem scale. Moreover, $TKE$ in mangrove forest increased monotonically with
${u_{w,RMS}}^2$ for each stem density. This study proposed a modified model for
the $TKE$ prediction within canopy scale considering the role of flexible
leaves and rigid stems together. Besides, $TKE/{u_{w,RMS}}^2$ presented a good
correlation with the ratio of wave excursion (${A_w}$) to stem spacing ($S$),
${A_w}$/$S$ and declined rapidly with ${A_w}$/$S$ especially when ${A_w}$/$S$
<0.1 for both stem and canopy scale. This empirical relationship can be a

momentum-space dynamics. However, efficient simulation of the global evolution
of systems involving runaway electrons typically requires a reduced fluid
description. This is needed for example in the design of essential runaway
mitigation methods for tokamaks. In this paper, we present a method to include
the effect of momentum-dependent spatial transport in the runaway avalanche
growth rate. We quantify the reduction of the growth rate in the presence of
electron diffusion in stochastic magnetic fields and show that the spatial
transport can raise the effective critical electric field. Using a perturbative
approach we derive a set of equations that allows treatment of the effect of
spatial transport on runaway dynamics in the presence of radial variation in
plasma parameters. This is then used to demonstrate the effect of spatial
transport in current quench simulations for ITER-like plasmas with massive
material injection. We find that in scenarios with sufficiently slow current
quench, due to moderate impurity and deuterium injection, the presence of
magnetic perturbations reduces the final runaway current considerably.
Perturbations localized at the edge are not effective in suppressing the
runaways, unless the runaway generation is off-axis, in which case they may
lead to formation of strong current sheets at the interface of the confined and
perturbed regions.

Parkinsonian conditions are simulated by assuming reduced dopaminergic input

for simplicity to be a point-like X-ray source located on the axis of the
accretion disc. However, the corona must intercept a number of optical/UV seed
photons from the disc consistent with the observed X-ray flux, which constrains
its size. We employ a relativistic ray-tracing code, originally developed by
Dov\v{c}iak & Done (2016), that calculates the size of a Comptonizing lamppost
corona illuminated by a standard thin disc. We assume that the disc extends
down to the innermost stable circular orbit of a non-spinning or a maximally
spinning black hole. We apply this method to a sample of 20 Seyfert 1 galaxies,
using simultaneous optical/UV and X-ray archival data from XMM-Newton. At least
for the sources accreting below the Eddington limit, we find that a
Comptonizing lamppost corona can generally exist, but with constraints on its
size and height above the event horizon of the black hole depending on the
spin. For a maximally spinning black hole, a solution can almost always be
found at any height, while for a non-spinning black hole the height must
generally be higher than 5 gravitational radii. This is because, for a given
luminosity, a higher spin implies more seed photons illuminating the corona due
to a larger and hotter inner disc area. The maximal spin solution is favored,
as it predicts an X-ray photon index in better agreement with the observations.

extrapolation of a modeling decision often overlooked: predicting the end of
the generative process through the use of a special end-of-sequence (EOS)
vocabulary item. We study an oracle setting - forcing models to generate to the
correct sequence length at test time - to compare the length-extrapolative
behavior of networks trained to predict EOS (+EOS) with networks not trained to
(-EOS). We find that -EOS substantially outperforms +EOS, for example
extrapolating well to lengths 10 times longer than those seen at training time
in a bracket closing task, as well as achieving a 40% improvement over +EOS in
the difficult SCAN dataset length generalization task. By comparing the hidden
states and dynamics of -EOS and +EOS models, we observe that +EOS models fail
to generalize because they (1) unnecessarily stratify their hidden states by
their linear position is a sequence (structures we call length manifolds) or
(2) get stuck in clusters (which we refer to as length attractors) once the EOS
token is the highest-probability prediction.

impurities on the surface states formed at the interface between a trivial and
a topological insulator. The interaction of electrons with the impurities is
accounted for by a separable pseudo-potential method that allows us to obtain
closed expressions for the density of states. Spectral properties of surface
states are assessed by means of the Green's function averaged over disorder
realizations. For comparison purposes, the configurationally averaged Green's
function is calculated by means of two different self-consistent methods,
namely the self-consistent Born approximation (SCBA) and the coherent potential
approximation (CPA). The latter is often regarded as the best single-site
theory for the study of the spectral properties of disordered systems. However,
although a large number of works employ the SCBA for the analysis of
many-impurity scattering on the surface of a topological insulator, CPA studies
of the same problem are scarce in the literature. In this work we find that the
SCBA overestimates the impact of the random distribution of impurities on the
spectral properties of surface states compared to the CPA predictions. The
difference is more pronounced when increasing the magnitude of the disorder.

related to the brittle crust thickness. These segments result in the formation
of the localized 'P-shear' deformation crossing and connecting the initial
Riedels structures (i.e. en-echelon fault structures) which formed during the
genesis stage of the fault zone. Mechanical models show that at all scales, the
geometrical characteristics of the Riedels exhibit dependency on the thickness
of the brittle layer. Combining the results of our mechanical discrete element
model with several analogue experiments using sand, clay and gypsum, we have
formulated a relationship between the orientation and spacing of Riedels and
the thickness of the brittle layer. From this relationship, we derive that for
a pure strike-slip mode, the maximum spacing between the Riedels are close to
three times the thickness. For a transtensional mode, as the extensive
component becomes predominant, the spacing distance at the surface become much
smaller than the thickness. Applying this relationship to several
well-characterized strike-slip faults on Earth, we show that the predicted
brittle thickness is consistent with the seismogenic depth. Supposing the
ubiquity of this phenomenon, we extent this relationship to characterize
en-echelon structures observed on Mars, in the Memnonia region located West of
Tharsis. Assuming that the outer ice shells of Ganymede, Enceladus and Europa,
exhibit a brittle behavior, we suggest values of the corresponding apparent
brittle thicknesses.

However, both of these annotations have the issue of discontinuity and thus
could result in some performance issues in neural network training. 2. Most
research works report Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of Euler angles as the
measurement of performance. We show that MAE may not reflect the actual
behavior especially for the cases of profile views. To solve these two
problems, we propose a new annotation method which uses three vectors to
describe head poses and a new measurement Mean Absolute Error of Vectors (MAEV)
to assess the performance. We also train a new neural network to predict the
three vectors with the constraints of orthogonality. Our proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art results on both AFLW2000 and BIWI datasets.

increasing the floor temperature of the star-forming gas which subsequently can

  selectivity and dimensionality","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2007.04440",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV cs.NE stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Representational sparsity is known to affect robustness to input
perturbations in deep neural networks (DNNs), but less is known about how the
semantic content of representations affects robustness. Class selectivity-the
variability of a unit's responses across data classes or dimensions-is one way
of quantifying the sparsity of semantic representations. Given recent evidence
that class selectivity may not be necessary for, and in some cases can impair
generalization, we investigate whether it also confers robustness (or
vulnerability) to perturbations of input data. We found that networks
regularized to have lower levels of class selectivity were more robust to
average-case (naturalistic) perturbations, while networks with higher class
selectivity are more vulnerable. In contrast, class selectivity increases
robustness to multiple types of worst-case (i.e. white box adversarial)
perturbations, suggesting that while decreasing class selectivity is helpful
for average-case perturbations, it is harmful for worst-case perturbations. To
explain this difference, we studied the dimensionality of the networks'
representations: we found that the dimensionality of early-layer
representations is inversely proportional to a network's class selectivity, and
that adversarial samples cause a larger increase in early-layer dimensionality
than corrupted samples. Furthermore, the input-unit gradient is more variable
across samples and units in high-selectivity networks compared to
low-selectivity networks. These results lead to the conclusion that units
participate more consistently in low-selectivity regimes compared to
high-selectivity regimes, effectively creating a larger attack surface and
hence vulnerability to worst-case perturbations.

formulated as an optimization problem for the maximization of the weighted

solution entails a high computational complexity which is not desirable for
real-time applications. Therefore, a suboptimal iterative algorithm is proposed
which \textit{jointly} optimizes all optimization variables in each iteration

exploits the idea that statistics of noise may be shared between the regions

which regions of a video contain the physiological signal and generate a

of common violations of the assumptions they rely on. Results In this article,
we introduce Mycorrhiza, a machine learning approach for the genotype
assignment problem. Our algorithm makes use of phylogenetic networks to
engineer features that encode the evolutionary relationships among samples.
Those features are then used as input to a Random Forests classifier. The
classification accuracy was assessed on multiple published empirical SNP,
microsatellite or consensus sequence datasets with wide ranges of size,
geographical distribution and population structure and on simulated datasets.
It compared favorably against widely used assessment tests or mixture analysis
methods such as STRUCTURE and Admixture, and against another machine-learning
based approach using principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction.
Mycorrhiza yields particularly significant gains on datasets with a large
average fixation index (FST) or deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium.
Moreover, the phylogenetic network approach estimates mixture proportions with
good accuracy.

field can be a source of clues to possible new physics underlying the Maxwell
Equations. But such study has been impeded by expressions for the parameters of
the electromagnetic energy flow that are inconsistent with the transformation
rules of special relativity.
  This paper begins by correcting a basic parameter, the local velocity of
electromagnetic energy flow. This correction is derived by the direct
application of the transformation rules of special relativity.
  After this correction, the electromagnetic energy-momentum tensor can then be
expressed in a reference system comoving with the energy flow. This tensor can
be made diagonal in the comoving system, and brought into a canonical form
depending only on the energy density and one other parameter.
  The corrected energy flow and its energy-momentum tensor are illustrated by a
simple example using static electric and magnetic fields
  The proposal that electromagnetic momentum results from the motion of a
relativistic mass contained in the fields is examined in the context of the
corrected flow velocity. It is found that electromagnetic field momentum,
though real, cannot be explained as due only to the motion of relativistic
mass.
  The paper concludes that introducing the requirement of consistency with
special relativity opens the study of electromagnetic energy and momentum to
new possibilities.

pathway between the brain and an effector without neuromuscular activation. BCI
experiments highlighted high intra and inter-subjects variability in the BCI
decoders. Although BCI model is generally relying on neurological markers
generalizable on the majority of subjects, it requires to generate a wide range
of neural features to include possible neurophysiological patterns. However,
the processing of noisy and high dimensional features, such as brain signals,
brings several challenges to overcome such as model calibration issues, model
generalization and interpretation problems and hardware related obstacles.
Approach. An online adaptive group-wise sparse decoder named Lp-Penalized
REW-NPLS algorithm (PREW-NPLS) is presented to reduce the feature space
dimension employed for BCI decoding. The proposed decoder was designed to
create BCI systems with low computational cost suited for portable applications
and tested during offline pseudo-online study based on online closed-loop BCI
control of the left and right 3D arm movements of a virtual avatar from the
ECoG recordings of a tetraplegic patient.
  Main results. PREW-NPLS algorithm highlight at least as good decoding
performance as REW-NPLS algorithm. However, the decoding performance obtained
with PREW-NPLS were achieved thanks to sparse models with up to 64% and 75% of
the electrodes set to 0 for the left and right hand models respectively using
L1-PREW-NPLS.
  Significance. The designed solution proposed an online incremental adaptive
algorithm suitable for online adaptive decoder calibration which estimate
sparse decoding solutions. The PREW-NPLS models are suited for portable
applications with low computational power using only small number of electrodes
with degrading the decoding performance.
