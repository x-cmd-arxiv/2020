heating rate $E_H$ to the pressure $P$ and length $L$ for static coronal loops
were established over 40 years ago; they have proved to be of immense value in
a wide range of studies. Here we extend these scaling laws to {\it dynamic}
loops, where enthalpy flux becomes important to the energy balance, and study
impulsive heating/filling characterized by upward enthalpy flows. We show that
for collision-dominated thermal conduction, the functional dependencies of the
scaling laws are the same as for the static case, when the radiative losses
scale as $T^{-1/2}$, but with a different constant of proportionality that
depends on the Mach number $M$ of the flow. The dependence on the Mach number
is such that the scaling laws for low to moderate Mach number flows are almost
indistinguishable from the static case. When thermal conduction is limited by
turbulent processes, however, the much weaker dependence of the scattering mean
free path (and hence thermal conduction coefficient) on temperature leads to a
limiting Mach number for return enthalpy fluxes driven by thermal conduction
between the corona and chromosphere.

concurrently trained models by encouraging them to represent the same function
through an auxiliary loss. This contrasts with the more commonly used
fully-synchronous data-parallel stochastic gradient descent methods, where
different model replicas average their gradients (or parameters) at every
iteration and thus maintain identical parameters. We investigate codistillation
in a distributed training setup, complementing previous work which focused on
extremely large batch sizes. Surprisingly, we find that even at moderate batch
sizes, models trained with codistillation can perform as well as models trained
with synchronous data-parallel methods, despite using a much weaker
synchronization mechanism. These findings hold across a range of batch sizes
and learning rate schedules, as well as different kinds of models and datasets.
Obtaining this level of accuracy, however, requires properly accounting for the
regularization effect of codistillation, which we highlight through several
empirical observations. Overall, this work contributes to a better
understanding of codistillation and how to best take advantage of it in a
distributed computing environment.

$\mathbb{F}_2^n$. The goal is to recover the individual subspaces, given
samples from a (weighted) mixture of samples drawn uniformly from the two
subspaces $A_0$ and $A_1$.
  This problem is computationally challenging, as it captures the notorious
problem of ""learning parities with noise"" in the degenerate setting when $A_1
\subseteq A_0$. This is in contrast to the analogous problem over the reals
that can be solved in polynomial time (Vidal'03). This leads to the following
natural question: is Learning Parities with Noise the only computational
barrier in obtaining efficient algorithms for learning mixtures of subspaces
over $\mathbb{F}_2^n$?
  The main result of this paper is an affirmative answer to the above question.
Namely, we show the following results: 1. When the subspaces $A_0$ and $A_1$
are incomparable, i.e., $A_0$ and $A_1$ are not contained inside each other,
then there is a polynomial time algorithm to recover the subspaces $A_0$ and
$A_1$. 2. In the case when $A_1$ is a subspace of $A_0$ with a significant gap
in the dimension i.e., $dim(A_1) \le \alpha dim(A_0)$ for $\alpha<1$, there is
a $n^{O(1/(1-\alpha))}$ time algorithm to recover the subspaces $A_0$ and
$A_1$.
  Thus, our algorithms imply computational tractability of the problem of
learning mixtures of two subspaces, except in the degenerate setting captured

binary millisecond pulsars (CBMSPs). Because these pulsars and their companion
stars are in tight orbits with typical separations of $10^{11}$ cm, their winds
interact strongly forming an intrabinary shock. Electron-positron pairs
reaccelerated at the shock can reach energies of about 10 TeV, which makes this
new population a potential source of GeV-TeV cosmic ray positrons. We present
an analytical model for the fluxes and spectra of positrons from intrabinary
shocks of CBMSPs. We find that the minimum energy $E_{\min}$ of the pairs that
enter the shock is critical to quantify the energy spectrum with which
positrons are injected into the interstellar medium. We measure for the first
time the Galactic scale height of CBMSPs, $z_e=0.4\pm0.1$ kpc, after correcting
for an observational bias against finding them close to the Galactic plane.
From this, we estimate a local density of 5-9 kpc$^{-3}$ and an extrapolated
total of 2-7 thousand CBMSPs in the Galaxy. We then propagate the pairs in the
isotropic diffusion approximation and find that the positron flux from the
total population is about two times higher than that from the 52 currently
known systems. For $E_{\min}$ between 1 and 50 GeV, our model predicts only a
minor contribution from CBMSPs to the diffuse positron flux at 100 GeV observed
at Earth. We also quantify the effects of anisotropic transport due to the
ordered Galactic magnetic field, which can change the diffuse flux from nearby
sources drastically. Finally, we find that a single ""hidden"" CBMSP close to the
Galactic plane can yield a positron flux comparable to the AMS-02 measurements
at 600 GeV if its line-of-sight to Earth is along the ordered Galactic field
lines, while its combined electron and positron flux at higher energies would
be close to the measurements of CALET, DAMPE and Fermi-LAT.

Inspiration often comes from living systems, in which robust global behavior

present two-dimensional stochastic networks that consist of minimal motifs
representing out-of-equilibrium cycles at the molecular scale and support
chiral edge currents in configuration space. These currents arise in the
topological phase due to the bulk-boundary correspondence and dominate the

blockages. We demonstrate the topological properties of these networks and
their uniquely non-Hermitian features such as exceptional points and vorticity,
while characterizing the edge state localization. As these emergent edge
currents are associated to macroscopic timescales and length scales, simply
tuning a small number of parameters enables varied dynamical phenomena
including a global clock, dynamical growth and shrinkage, and synchronization.
Our construction provides a novel topological formalism for stochastic systems
and fresh insights into non-Hermitian physics, paving the way for the

real-world environments, designing for safety becomes a critical consideration.
We specifically focus on researching scenarios where agents can cause undesired
side effects while executing a policy on a primary task. Since one can define
multiple tasks for a given environment dynamics, there are two important
challenges. First, we need to abstract the concept of safety that applies
broadly to that environment independent of the specific task being executed.
Second, we need a mechanism for the abstracted notion of safety to modulate the
actions of agents executing different policies to minimize their side-effects.
In this work, we propose Safety Aware Reinforcement Learning (SARL) - a
framework where a virtual safe agent modulates the actions of a main
reward-based agent to minimize side effects. The safe agent learns a
task-independent notion of safety for a given environment. The main agent is
then trained with a regularization loss given by the distance between the
native action probabilities of the two agents. Since the safe agent effectively
abstracts a task-independent notion of safety via its action probabilities, it
can be ported to modulate multiple policies solving different tasks within the
given environment without further training. We contrast this with solutions
that rely on task-specific regularization metrics and test our framework on the
SafeLife Suite, based on Conway's Game of Life, comprising a number of complex
tasks in dynamic environments. We show that our solution is able to match the
performance of solutions that rely on task-specific side-effect penalties on
both the primary and safety objectives while additionally providing the benefit
of generalizability and portability.

accelerated evaluation of fields produced by groups of sources on the basis of
a recursive application of classical interpolation methods. Unlike other

strongly suppressed near an integer concentration of conduction electrons as
Coulomb interactions forbid the double occupancy of local atomic orbitals.
While the Mott-Hubbard physics arising from such on-site interactions has been
largely studied, several unexplained phenomena observed in correlated materials
challenge this description and call for the development of new ideas. Here we
explore a general route for obtaining correlated behavior that is decidedly
different from the spin-related Mott-Hubbard mechanism and instead relies on
the presence of unscreened, long-range Coulomb interactions. We find a
pseudogap metal phase characterized by a divergent quasiparticle mass and the
opening of a Coulomb pseudogap in the electronic spectrum. The destruction of
the Fermi-liquid state occurs because the electrons move in a nearly frozen,
disordered charge background, as collective charge rearrangements are
drastically slowed down by the frustrating nature of long-range potentials on
discrete lattices. The present pseudogap metal realizes an early conjecture by
Efros, that a soft Coulomb gap should appear for quantum lattice electrons with
strong unscreened interactions due to self-generated randomness.

discussion starts with a systematic derivation of the TOV equation from the

describing a star of finite radius, assuming suitable conditions on the
equation of state characterizing the gas. We also prove that the compactness of
the gas contained inside a sphere centered at the origin satisfies the
well-known Buchdahl bound, independent of the radius of the sphere. Further, we
derive the equation of state for an ideal, classical monoatomic relativistic
gas from statistical mechanics considerations and show that it satisfies our
assumptions for the existence of a unique solution describing a finite radius
star. Although none of the results discussed in this article are new, they are
usually scattered in different articles and books in the literature; hence it

are able to generalize better when they are trained with a larger number of
observed tasks and with a larger amount of data per task. Given the amount of
resources that are needed, it is generally difficult to expect the tasks, their
respective data, and the necessary computational capacity to be available at a
single central location. It is more natural to encounter situations where these
resources are spread across several agents connected by some graph topology.
The formalism of meta-learning is actually well-suited to this decentralized
setting, where the learner would be able to benefit from information and
computational power spread across the agents. Motivated by this observation, in
this work, we propose a cooperative fully-decentralized multi-agent
meta-learning algorithm, referred to as Diffusion-based MAML or Dif-MAML.
Decentralized optimization algorithms are superior to centralized
implementations in terms of scalability, avoidance of communication
bottlenecks, and privacy guarantees. The work provides a detailed theoretical
analysis to show that the proposed strategy allows a collection of agents to
attain agreement at a linear rate and to converge to a stationary point of the

energetic jets. A jet is a collimated spray of particles generated via
successive parton branchings, starting with a virtual quark or gluon produced
by the collision. When such a jet is produced in the dense environment of a
nucleus-nucleus collision, its interactions with the surrounding medium lead to
a modification of its properties, phenomenon known as jet quenching. In this
thesis, we develop a new theory to describe jet quenching. We compute for the
first time the effects of the medium on multiple vacuum-like emissions, that is
emissions triggered by the virtuality of the initial parton. We present a new
physical picture for jet evolution, with notably a factorisation in time
between vacuum-like emissions and medium-induced emissions. This picture is
Markovian, hence well suited for a Monte Carlo implementation that we develop
in the parton shower JetMed. We then investigate the phenomenological
consequences of our new picture on jet observables and especially the jet
nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$, the Soft Drop $z_g$ distribution and the

we determine this number in a more general setting in which the local parties

number.
  Local state discrimination is closely related to the topic of entangled
subspaces, which we study in its own right. We introduce $r$-entangled
subspaces, which naturally generalize previously studied spaces to higher
multipartite entanglement. We use algebraic-geometric methods to determine the
maximum dimension of an $r$-entangled subspace, and present novel explicit

exists much uncertainty regarding the reaction mechanisms with few constraints

performed to determine the likely reaction rates. In this work, we consider
methods for reducing the computational expense of performing Bayesian inference
on a reaction network by looking at the geometry of the network. Two methods of
exploiting the topology of the reaction network are presented. One involves
reducing a reaction network to just the reaction chains with constraints on
them. After this, new constraints are added to the reaction network and it is
shown that one can separate this new reaction network into sub-networks. The
fact that networks can be separated into sub-networks is particularly important
for the reaction networks of interstellar complex organic molecules, whose
surface reaction networks may have hundreds of reactions. Both methods allow
the maximum-posterior reaction rate to be recovered with minimal bias.

demonstrate that the conductivity diverges beyond a critical density, signaling
the onset of a condensation transition observed in the past. In a striking

the diverging conductivity thus underlies a dynamic ""superfluidlike"" transition

The objective is to jointly minimize the travel time and energy consumption of

single-lane roads. A direct extension to multiple lanes on each road is limited
by the computational complexity required to obtain an explicit optimal control

employ a method combining optimal control and control barrier functions, which

($\eta$) and bulk ($\zeta$) viscosities. The viscosities are calculated using
kinetic theory in the relaxation time approximation. The interactions are
incorporated through the quasiparticle masses of partons at strong magnetic
field and finite chemical potential. From this study, one can understand the
effects of strong magnetic field and chemical potential on the sound
attenuation through the Prandtl number (Pl), on the nature of the flow by the
Reynolds number (Rl), and on the relative behavior between shear viscosity and
bulk viscosity through the ratio $\zeta/\eta$. We have found that, $\eta$ and
$\zeta$ get increased in a strong magnetic field and the additional presence of
chemical potential further enhances their magnitudes. With the increase of
temperature, $\eta$ increases in a strong magnetic field as well as in the
absence of magnetic field, whereas $\zeta$ decreases with the temperature,
contrary to its increase in the absence of magnetic field. We have observed
that, the Prandtl number gets increased in the presence of strong magnetic
field and chemical potential as compared to the isotropic one, but it always
remains larger than 1, thus the momentum diffusion largely affects the sound
attenuation in the medium. The Reynolds number gets lowered than 1 in a strong
magnetic field and it becomes further decreased in an additional presence of
chemical potential, so the kinematic viscosity dominates over the
characteristic length scale of the system. Finally, $\zeta/\eta$ becomes larger
than 1, contrary to its value in the absence of magnetic field and chemical
potential where it is less than 1, so the bulk viscosity prevails over the
shear viscosity for the hot and dense QCD matter in the presence of a strong
magnetic field.

occupation probability and $L$ is the linear system size. The solution of
$P_{\rm B} = 0$ can reproduce all known exact thresholds and leads to
unprecedented estimates for thresholds of unsolved planar-lattice models. In
two dimensions, assuming the universality of $P_{\rm B}$, we use it to study a
nonplanar lattice model, i.e., the equivalent-neighbor lattice bond
percolation, and the continuum percolation of identical penetrable disks, by
Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling analysis. It is found that, in
comparison with other quantities, $P_{\rm B}$ suffers much less from
finite-size corrections. As a result, we obtain a series of high-precision
thresholds $p_c(z)$ as a function of coordination number $z$ for
equivalent-neighbor percolation with $z$ up to O$(10^5)$, and clearly confirm
the asymptotic behavior $zp_c-1 \sim 1/\sqrt{z}$ for $z \rightarrow \infty$.
For the continuum percolation model, we surprisingly observe that the
finite-size correction in $P_{\rm B}$ is unobservable within uncertainty
O$(10^{-5})$ as long as $L \geq 3$. The estimated threshold number density of
disks is $\rho_c = 1.436 325 05(10)$, slightly below the most recent result
$\rho_c = 1.436 325 45(8)$ of Mertens and Moore obtained by other means. Our

implies $zp_{c} \sim 4 \eta_c = 4.51235$ in 2D and $zp_{c} \sim 8 \eta_c =
2.73512$ in 3D for large $z$ for circular and spherical neighborhoods
respectively, where $z$ is the coordination number. Fitting our data to the

$b$ represents a finite-$z$ correction term. We also study power-law fits of
the thresholds.

Here we propose such a design for a scalable and fault-tolerant photonic
quantum computer informed by the latest developments in theory and technology.
Central to our architecture is the generation and manipulation of
three-dimensional hybrid resource states comprising both bosonic qubits and
squeezed vacuum states. The proposal enables exploiting state-of-the-art
procedures for the non-deterministic generation of bosonic qubits combined with
the strengths of continuous-variable quantum computation, namely the
implementation of Clifford gates using easy-to-generate squeezed states.
Moreover, the architecture is based on two-dimensional integrated photonic
chips used to produce a qubit cluster state in one temporal and two spatial
dimensions. By reducing the experimental challenges as compared to existing
architectures and by enabling room-temperature quantum computation, our design
opens the door to scalable fabrication and operation, which may allow photonics
to leap-frog other platforms on the path to a quantum computer with millions of

simulations creates a range of single-dish intensity mapping test cases that
require different foreground treatments. This allows us to conduct the most
generalized study to date into 21cm foregrounds and their cleaning techniques

most commonly used blind foreground removal techniques (PCA/SVD, FASTICA,
GMCA). We also trial a non-blind parametric fitting technique and discuss
potential hybridization of methods. We highlight the similarities and
differences in these techniques finding that the blind methods produce near
equivalent results, and we explain the fundamental reasons for this. The
simulations allow an exact decomposition of the resulting cleaned data and we
analyse the contribution from foreground residuals. Our results demonstrate
that polarized foreground residuals should be generally subdominant to HI on
small scales ($k\gtrsim0.1\,h\,\text{Mpc}^{-1}$). However, on larger scales,
results are more region dependent. In some cases, aggressive cleans severely
damp HI power but still leave dominant foreground residuals. We also
demonstrate the gain from cross-correlations with optical galaxy surveys, where
extreme levels of residual foregrounds can be circumvented. However, these
residuals still contribute to errors and we discuss the optimal balance between
over- and under-cleaning.

normalization schemes (including Batch Normalization) in today's deep learning
can move it far from a traditional optimization viewpoint, e.g., use of
exponentially increasing learning rates. The current paper highlights other
ways in which behavior of normalized nets departs from traditional viewpoints,
and then initiates a formal framework for studying their mathematics via
suitable adaptation of the conventional framework namely, modeling SGD-induced
training trajectory via a suitable stochastic differential equation (SDE) with
a noise term that captures gradient noise. This yields: (a) A new ' intrinsic
learning rate' parameter that is the product of the normal learning rate and
weight decay factor. Analysis of the SDE shows how the effective speed of
learning varies and equilibrates over time under the control of intrinsic LR.
(b) A challenge -- via theory and experiments -- to popular belief that good
generalization requires large learning rates at the start of training. (c) New
experiments, backed by mathematical intuition, suggesting the number of steps
to equilibrium (in function space) scales as the inverse of the intrinsic
learning rate, as opposed to the exponential time convergence bound implied by
SDE analysis. We name it the Fast Equilibrium Conjecture and suggest it holds
the key to why Batch Normalization is effective.

generative models with applications in many domains. However, they struggle to
generate high-quality images, especially when samples are obtained from the
prior without any tempering. One explanation for VAEs' poor generative quality
is the prior hole problem: the prior distribution fails to match the aggregate
approximate posterior. Due to this mismatch, there exist areas in the latent
space with high density under the prior that do not correspond to any encoded
image. Samples from those areas are decoded to corrupted images. To tackle this
issue, we propose an energy-based prior defined by the product of a base prior
distribution and a reweighting factor, designed to bring the base closer to the
aggregate posterior. We train the reweighting factor by noise contrastive
estimation, and we generalize it to hierarchical VAEs with many latent variable
groups. Our experiments confirm that the proposed noise contrastive priors
improve the generative performance of state-of-the-art VAEs by a large margin

$T$ is a complete first-order theory extending the theory of modules, then the

asked if the same is true for any abstract elementary class $(K, \leq_p)$ such
that $K$ is a class of modules and $\leq_p$ is the pure submodule relation. In
this paper we give some instances where this is true:
  $\textbf{Theorem.}$ Assume $R$ is an associative ring with unity. Let $(K,
\leq_p)$ be an AEC such that $K \subseteq R\text{-Mod}$ and $K$ is closed under
finite direct sums, then:
  - If $K$ is closed under pure-injective envelopes, then $(K, \leq_p)$ is
$\lambda$-stable for every $\lambda \geq LS(K)$ such that $\lambda^{|R| +

  - If $K$ is closed under pure submodules and pure epimorphic images, then
$(K, \leq_p)$ is $\lambda$-stable for every $\lambda$ such that $\lambda^{|R| +

  - Assume $R$ is Von Neumann regular. If $K$ is closed under submodules and
has arbitrarily large models, then $(K, \leq_p)$ is $\lambda$-stable for every

  As an application of these results we give new characterizations of
noetherian rings, pure-semisimple rings, dedekind domains, and fields via
superstability. Moreover, we show how these results can be used to show a link
between being good in the stability hierarchy and being good in the
axiomatizability hierarchy.
  Another application is the existence of universal models with respect to pure
embeddings in several classes of modules. Among them, the class of flat modules
and the class of injective torsion modules.

understanding star-formation processes and the role of feedback and baryonic
cycling in galaxy evolution. Here we exploit a sample of 392 galaxies (dubbed
MAGMA, Metallicity and Gas for Mass Assembly), presented in a recent paper, to
quantify molecular and atomic gas properties across a broad range in stellar
mass, Mstar, from $\sim 10^7 - 10^{11}$ Msun. First, we find the metallicity
($Z$) dependence of alpha_CO to be shallower than previous estimates, with
alpha_CO$\propto (Z/Z_\odot)^{-1.55}$. Second, molecular gas mass MH2 is found
to be strongly correlated with Mstar and star-formation rate (SFR), enabling
predictions of MH2 good to within $\sim$0.2 dex. The behavior of atomic gas
mass MHI in MAGMA scaling relations suggests that it may be a third,
independent variable that encapsulates information about the circumgalactic
environment and gas accretion. If Mgas is considered to depend on MHI, together
with Mstar and SFR, we obtain a relation that predicts Mgas to within
$\sim$0.05 dex. Finally, the analysis of depletion times and the scaling of
MHI/Mstar and MH2/Mstar over three different mass bins suggests that the
partition of gas and the regulation of star formation through gas content
depends on the mass regime. Dwarf galaxies tend to be overwhelmed by (HI)
accretion, while for galaxies in the intermediate Mstar ""gas-equilibrium"" bin,
star formation proceeds apace with gas availability. In the most massive
""gas-poor, bimodality"" galaxies, HI does not apparently participate in star
formation, although it generally dominates in mass over H2. Our results confirm
that atomic gas plays a key role in baryonic cycling, and is a fundamental
ingredient for current and future star formation, especially in dwarf galaxies.

plays a critical role in resolving the open question of wide binary formation.
In this paper, we investigate the metallicity ([Fe/H]) and age dependence of
the wide-binary fraction (binary separations between $10^3$ and $10^4$ AU) for
field F and G dwarfs within 500 pc by combining their metallicity and radial
velocity measurements from LAMOST DR5 with the astrometric information from
Gaia DR2. We show that the wide-binary fraction strongly depends on the
metallicity: as metallicity increases, the wide-binary fraction first
increases, peaks at [Fe/H]$\simeq 0$, and then decreases at the high
metallicity end. The wide-binary fraction at [Fe/H]$=0$ is about two times
larger than that at [Fe/H]$=-1$ and [Fe/H]$=+0.5$. This metallicity dependence
is dominated by the thin-disk stars. Using stellar kinematics as a proxy of
stellar age, we show that younger stars have a higher wide-binary fraction at
fixed metallicity close to solar. We propose that multiple formation channels
are responsible for the metallicity and age dependence. In particular, the
positive metallicity correlation at [Fe/H]$<0$ and the age dependence may be
due to the denser formation environments and higher-mass clusters at earlier
times. The negative metallicity correlation at [Fe/H]$>0$ can be inherited from
the similar metallicity dependence of close binaries, and radial migration may
play a role in enhancing the wide-binary fraction around the solar metallicity.

We investigate the process behind this hypothesis using an $N$-body simulation
of a MW-analogue halo with velocity dependent self-interacting dark matter
(vdSIDM) in which the low velocity self-scattering cross-section,
$\sigma_{T}/m_{x}$, reaches 100 cm$^{2}$g$^{-1}$; we dub this model the vd100
model. We compare the results of this simulation to simulations of the same
halo that employ different dark models, including cold dark matter (CDM) and
other, less extreme SIDM models. The masses of the vd100 haloes are very
similar to their CDM counterparts, but the values of their maximum circular
velocities, $V_{max}$, are significantly higher. We determine that these high
$V_{max}$ subhaloes were objects in the mass range [$5\times10^{6}$,
$1\times10^{8}$] $M_\odot$ at $z=1$ that undergo gravothermal core collapse.
These collapsed haloes have density profiles that are described by single power
laws down to the resolution limit of the simulation, and the inner slope of
this density profile is approximately $-3$. Resolving the ever decreasing
collapsed region is challenging, and tailored simulations will be required to
model the runaway instability accurately at scales $<1$ kpc.

dimensions. When the true data generating process is based on physical
processes these impose symmetries and constraints, and the generative model can
be created by learning an effective description of the underlying physics,
which enables scaling of the generative model to very high dimensions. In this
work we propose Lagrangian Deep Learning (LDL) for this purpose, applying it to
learn outputs of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The model uses layers
of Lagrangian displacements of particles describing the observables to learn
the effective physical laws. The displacements are modeled as the gradient of
an effective potential, which explicitly satisfies the translational and
rotational invariance. The total number of learned parameters is only of order
10, and they can be viewed as effective theory parameters. We combine N-body
solver FastPM with LDL and apply them to a wide range of cosmological outputs,
from the dark matter to the stellar maps, gas density and temperature. The
computational cost of LDL is nearly four orders of magnitude lower than the
full hydrodynamical simulations, yet it outperforms it at the same resolution.
We achieve this with only of order 10 layers from the initial conditions to the
final output, in contrast to typical cosmological simulations with thousands of
time steps. This opens up the possibility of analyzing cosmological
observations entirely within this framework, without the need for large
dark-matter simulations.

sources of cosmological information, making it crucial to have a precise
understanding of the influence of baryons on cosmological observables. The
Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) provides a
consistent way to predict the clustering of dark matter and baryons on large
scales, where their leading corrections in perturbation theory are given by a
simple and calculable functional form even after the onset of baryonic
processes. In this paper, we extend the two-fluid-like system up to two-loop
order in perturbation theory. Along the way, we show that a new linear
counterterm proportional to the relative velocity of the fluids could
generically be present, but we show that its effects are expected to be small
in our universe. Regardless, we show how to consistently perform perturbation
theory in the presence of this new term. We find that the EFTofLSS at two-loop
order can accurately account for the details of baryonic processes on large
scales. We compare our results to a hydrodynamical $N$-body simulation at many
redshifts and find that the counterterms associated with the leading
corrections to dark matter and baryons start to differ between redshifts $z
\approx 3$ and $z \approx 2$, signaling the onset of star-formation physics. We
then use these fits to compute the lensing power spectrum, show that the
understanding of baryonic processes will be important for analyzing CMB-S4
data, and show that the two-loop EFTofLSS accurately captures these effects for
$\ell \lesssim 2000$. Our results are also potentially of interest for current

a complex of X-ray-emitting threads plus plume-like structures emerging from
the Galactic center (GC). This mapping shows that the northern plume or
fountain is offset from a well-known radio lobe (or the GCL), which however may
represent a foreground HII region, and that the southern plume is well wrapped
by a corresponding radio lobe recently discovered by MeerKAT. In particular, we
find that a distinct X-ray thread, G0.17-0.41, is embedded well within a
nonthermal radio filament, which is locally inflated. This thread with a width
of ~1.6"" (FWHM) is ~6 pc long at the distance of the GC and has a spectrum that
can be characterized by a power law or an optically-thin thermal plasma with

strand of magnetic field with its strength > 1 mG, not unusual in such radio
filaments. These morphological and spectral properties of the radio/X-ray

Such re-connection events are probably common when flux tubes of antiparallel

quantify the `edges' of the stellar and dark matter distribution. The radius of
the steepest slope in the dark matter, commonly used as a proxy for the
splashback radius, is located at ~r_200m; the strength and location of this
feature depends on the recent mass accretion rate, in good agreement with
previous work. Interestingly, the stellar distribution (or intracluster light,
ICL) also has a well-defined edge, which is directly related to the splashback
radius of the halo. Thus, detecting the edge of the ICL can provide an
independent measure of the physical boundary of the halo, and the recent mass
accretion rate. We show that these caustics can also be seen in the projected
density profiles, but care must be taken to account for the influence of
substructures and other non-diffuse material, which can bias and/or weaken the
signal of the steepest slope. This is particularly important for the stellar
material, which has a higher fraction bound in subhaloes than the dark matter.
Finally, we show that the `stellar splashback' feature is located beyond
current observational constraints on the ICL, but these large projected
distances (>> 1 Mpc) and low surface brightnesses (mu >> 32 mag/arcsec^2) can
be reached with upcoming observational facilities such as the Vera C. Rubin

we examine the question of how the inferred parameters change with the choice

integrated light spectra of globular clusters (GCs) from the literature and
fitted them to stellar population models using the code Starlight. We performed
tests using different regions of the spectra to infer reddening, ages, [Fe/H]
and [alpha/Fe]. Comparing our results to age values obtained from isochrone
fitting and chemical abundances from high resolution spectroscopy, we find
that: (1) The inferred parameters change with the wavelength range used; (2)
The method in general retrieves good reddening estimates, specially when a
wider wavelength range is fitted; (3) The ideal spectral regions for
determination of age, [Fe/H], and [alpha/Fe] are: 4170-5540A, 5280-7020A, and

importantly, robust against experimental noise and imperfections. Specifically,
we prove that the detection of entanglement in a linear number of bipartitions

Moreover, our method goes beyond the standard procedure of separating the state
from the convex hull of biseparable states, yielding an improved finesse and
robustness compared to previous techniques. We apply our method to the noisy
readout of stabilizer operators of the distance-three topological color code
and its flag-based fault-tolerant version. In particular, we subject the
circuits to combinations of three types of noise, namely, uniform depolarizing
noise, two-qubit gate depolarizing noise, and bit-flip measurement noise. We
numerically compare our method with the standard, yet generally inefficient,
fidelity test and to a pair of efficient witnesses, verifying the increased

gas around low-redshift galaxies has significant angular momentum, we use the
high-resolution EAGLE cosmological simulation to analyze the morphological and
rotation structures of the $z\approx0.3$ circumgalactic Mg II gas and examine
how they change with the host galaxy properties. Around star-forming galaxies,
we find that the Mg II gas has an axisymmetric instead of a spherical
distribution, and the axis of symmetry aligns with that of the Mg II gas
rotation. A similar rotating structure is less commonly found in the small
sample of simulated quiescent galaxies. We also examine how often Mg II gas
around galaxies selected using a line-of-sight velocity cut includes gas
physically outside of the virial radius ($r_\mathrm{vir}$). For example, we
show that at an impact parameter of 100 pkpc, a $\pm500$ km s$^{-1}$ velocity
cut around galaxies with stellar masses of $10^9$-$10^{9.5}\mathrm{M_\odot}$
($10^{10}$-$10^{10.5}\mathrm{M_\odot}$) selects Mg II gas beyond the virial

detection of corotation. While the corotating Mg II gas generally extends
beyond $0.5r_\mathrm{vir}$, the Mg II gas outside of the virial radius

occupation analyses. The transition halo mass scale, where half of halos
contain quiescent central galaxies, is at M_h~10^12.4 Msol/h, significantly
higher than other constraints. Additionally, the width of the transition from
predominantly star-forming halos to quiescent halos occurs over a narrower

significantly more massive than star-forming centrals at the same halo mass,

momentum dependence of the effective interaction to the decay rates. The
phononic contributions, present in the M-EELS spectra due to electron-phonon
coupling, lead to kink features in the corresponding single-particle spectra at
energies between 40 meV and 80 meV, independent of the doping level. We find
that a repulsive interaction constant in momentum space is able to yield the
kink attributed to phonons in ARPES. Hence, our analysis of the M-EELS spectra
points to local repulsive interactions as a factor that enhances the
spectroscopic signatures of electron-phonon coupling in cuprates. We conclude
that the strength of the kink feature in cuprates is determined by the combined

  activity level in children",,,,,"q-bio.QM","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Background: Limited research exists on the association between changes in
physical activity levels and injury in children. Objective: To assess how well
different variations of the acute:chronic workload ratio (ACWR), a measure of
change in activity, predict injury in children. Methods: We conducted a
prospective cohort study using data from 1670 Danish schoolchildren measured
over 5.5 years (2008 to 2014). Coupled 4-week, uncoupled 4-week, and uncoupled
5-week ACWRs were calculated using activity frequency in the past week as the
acute load (numerator), and average weekly activity frequency in the past 4 or
5 weeks as the chronic load (denominator). We modelled the relationship between
different ACWR variations and injury using generalized linear and generalized
additive models, with and without accounting for repeated measures. Results:
The prognostic relationship between the ACWR and injury risk was best
represented using a generalized additive mixed model for the uncoupled 5-week
ACWR. It predicted an injury risk of ~3% for ACWRs between 0.8 (activity level
decreased by 20%) and 1.5 (activity level increased by 50%). When activity
decreased by more than 20% (ACWR< 0.8), injury risk was lower (minimum of 1.5%
at ACWR=0). When activity increased by more than 50% (ACWR > 1.5), injury risk
was higher (maximum of 6% at ACWR = 5). Girls were at significantly higher risk
of injury than boys. Conclusion: Increases in physical activity in children are
associated with much lower injury risks compared to previous results in adults.

$\mathrm{mex}(n,H)=\mathrm{ex}(n, K_{k+1})$. This conjecture generalizes
Tur\'an's theorem.
  Diwan and Mubayi also asked for an analogue of Erd\H{o}s-Stone-Simonovits

Accordingly, far-infrared optical responses have been understood in the

we show, by investigating the selection rules imposed by particle-hole symmetry

can occur in clean multi-band superconductors when one of the following three
conditions is satisfied: (i) inversion symmetry breaking, (ii) symmetry
protection of the Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces, or (iii) simply finite spin-orbit

indicates that clean-limit optical responses are common beyond the
straightforward case of broken inversion symmetry. We apply our theory to
optical responses in FeSe, a clean multi-band superconductor with inversion
symmetry and significant spin-orbit coupling. This result paves the way for
studying clean-limit superconductors through optical measurements.

halos across the bulk of cosmic time, with log $M/M_\odot$~12.5-13.0 to z~2.5.
We show that this is due in part to the AGN fraction in galaxies rising with
increasing stellar mass, combined with AGN observational selection effects that
exacerbate this trend. Here, we use AGN specific accretion rate distribution
functions determined as a function of stellar mass and redshift for
star-forming and quiescent galaxies separately, combined with the latest
galaxy-halo connection models, to determine the parent and sub-halo mass
distribution function of AGN to various observational limits. We find that
while the median (sub-)halo mass of AGN, $\approx10^{12}M_\odot$, is fairly
constant with luminosity, specific accretion rate, and redshift, the full halo
mass distribution function is broad, spanning several orders of magnitude. We
show that widely used methods to infer a typical dark matter halo mass based on
an observed AGN clustering amplitude can result in biased, systematically high
host halo masses. While the AGN satellite fraction rises with increasing parent
halo mass, we find that the central galaxy is often not an AGN. Our results
elucidate the physical causes for the apparent uniformity of AGN host halos
across cosmic time and underscore the importance of accounting for AGN
selection biases when interpreting observational AGN clustering results. We
further show that AGN clustering is most easily interpreted in terms of the

M-type stellar companions. We measure the disc orientation with resolved images
from Herschel and constrain the three-dimensional orbits of the outer planets
with Gaia DR2 and Hipparcos astrometry. Resolved disc modelling leaves
degeneracy in the disc orientation, so we derive four separate planet-disc
mutual inclination ($\Delta I$) solutions. The most aligned solutions give
$\Delta I=17-32\deg$ for HD 113337 and $\Delta I=21-45\deg$ for HD 38529 (both
1$\sigma$). In both systems, there is a small probability (<0.3 per cent) that
the planet and disc are nearly aligned ($\Delta I < 3\deg$). The stellar and
planetary companions cause the orbits of disc material to precess about a plane
defined by the forced inclination. We determine this as well as the precession
time-scale to interpret the mutual inclination results. We find that the debris
discs in both systems could be warped via joint influences of the outer planet
and stellar companion, potentially explaining the observed misalignments.
However, this requires HD 113337 to be old (0.8-1.7 Gyr), whereas if young
(14-21 Myr), the observed misalignment in HD 113337 could be inherited from the
protoplanetary disc phase. For both systems, the inclination of the stellar
spin axis is consistent with the disc and outer planet inclinations, which
instead supports system-wide alignment or near alignment. High-resolution
observations of the discs and improved constraints on the planetary orbits
would provide firmer conclusions about the (mis)alignment status.

with Hamiltonian structure that exhibits weakly turbulent dynamics, has been
found to accurately predict the anomalous wave statistics observed in recent
laboratory experiments. Majda et al. (2019) developed a TKdV statistical
mechanics framework based on a mixed Gibbs measure that is supported on a
surface of fixed energy (microcanonical) and takes the usual macroconical form
in the Hamiltonian. This paper reports two rigorous results regarding the
surface-displacement distributions implied by this ensemble, both in the limit
of the cutoff wavenumber $\Lambda$ growing large. First, we prove that if the
inverse temperature vanishes, microstate statistics converge to Gaussian as
$\Lambda \to \infty$. Second, we prove that if nonlinearity is absent and the
inverse-temperature satisfies a certain physically-motivated scaling law, then
microstate statistics converge to Gaussian as $\Lambda \to \infty$. When the
scaling law is not satisfied, simple numerical examples demonstrate symmetric,
yet highly non-Gaussian, displacement statistics to emerge in the linear
system, illustrating that nonlinearity is not a strict requirement for
non-normality in the fixed-energy ensemble. The new results, taken together,
imply necessary conditions for the anomalous wave statistics observed in
previous numerical studies. In particular, non-vanishing inverse temperature
and either the presence of nonlinearity or the violation of the scaling law are
required for displacement statistics to deviate from Gaussian. The proof of
this second theorem involves the construction of an approximating measure,
which we find also elucidates the peculiar spectral decay observed in numerical
studies and may open the door for improved sampling algorithms.

learn a centralized action value function as a monotonic mixing of per-agent

restricted joint action value function can prevent them from solving tasks that
require significant coordination between agents at a given timestep. We show
that this problem can be overcome by improving the joint exploration of all
agents during training. Specifically, we propose a novel MARL approach called
Universal Value Exploration (UneVEn) that learns a set of related tasks
simultaneously with a linear decomposition of universal successor features.
With the policies of already solved related tasks, the joint exploration
process of all agents can be improved to help them achieve better coordination.
Empirical results on a set of exploration games, challenging cooperative
predator-prey tasks requiring significant coordination among agents, and
StarCraft II micromanagement benchmarks show that UneVEn can solve tasks where
other state-of-the-art MARL methods fail.

While S2P jointly trains interactive and supervised losses to counter the

many solutions there are, or be able to enumerate the set of all solutions.
  Bounded and low degree are rather natural notions and both yield efficient
algorithms. For example, Berkholz, Keppeler, and Schweikardt showed in 2017
that over databases of bounded degree, not only any first order query can
efficiently be tested, counted and enumerated, but the data structure used can
be updated when the database itself is updated.
  This paper extends existing results in two directions. First, we show that
over classes of databases with low degree, there is a data structure that
enables us to test, count and enumerate the solutions of first order queries.
This data structure can also be efficiently recomputed when the database is
updated. Secondly, for classes of databases with bounded degree we show that,
without increasing the preprocessing time, we can compute a data structure that
does not depend on the query but only on its quantifier rank. We can therefore
perform a single preprocessing that can later be used for many queries.

since they were first perceived as Si-compatible, direct-band-gap
semiconductors 30 years ago. Such a perception underlies the understanding,
interpretation and prediction of alloys' properties. However, as the race to
create scalable and tunable device materials enters a composition domain far
beyond alloys' equilibrium solubility, a fundamental question emerges as to how
random these alloys truly are. Here we show, by combining statistical sampling
and large-scale ab initio calculations, that GeSn alloy, a promising group IV
alloy for mid-infrared technology, exhibits a clear, short-range order for
solute atoms within its entire composition range. Such short-range order is
further found to substantially affect the electronic properties of GeSn. We
demonstrate the proper inclusion of this short-range order through canonical
sampling can lead to a significant improvement over previous predictions on
alloy's band gaps, by showing an excellent agreement with experiments within

neuroscience, despite its heavy reliance on concepts in physics, is anomalous
in this regard as its main equations of motion are not compatible with a

Taking the Dynamic Causal Modelling neuronal state equation, Hodgkin-Huxley

possible to write complex oscillatory forms of these equations in terms of a
single Lagrangian. We therefore bring mathematical descriptions in
computational neuroscience under the remit of the principle of stationary

the study of large-scale public health threats ranging from gun violence and
earthquakes to wildfires and viral contagion. Whereas many such applications
feature locational uncertainty, i.e., the exact spatial positions of individual
events are unknown, most Hawkes model analyses to date have ignored spatial
coarsening present in the data. Three particular 21st century public health
crises -- urban gun violence, rural wildfires and global viral spread --
present qualitatively and quantitatively varying uncertainty regimes that
exhibit (a) different collective magnitudes of spatial coarsening, (b) uniform
and mixed magnitude coarsening, (c) differently shaped uncertainty regions and
-- less orthodox -- (d) locational data distributed within the `wrong'
effective space. We explicitly model such uncertainties in a Bayesian manner
and jointly infer unknown locations together with all parameters of a
reasonably flexible Hawkes model, obtaining results that are practically and
statistically distinct from those obtained while ignoring spatial coarsening.
This work also features two different secondary contributions: first, to
facilitate Bayesian inference of locations and background rate parameters, we
make a subtle yet crucial change to an established kernel-based rate model; and
second, to facilitate the same Bayesian inference at scale, we develop a
massively parallel implementation of the model's log-likelihood gradient with
respect to locations and thus avoid its quadratic computational cost in the
context of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Our examples involve thousands of
observations and allow us to demonstrate practicality at moderate scales.

strong Balmer and He I line emission, consistent with accretion, as well as
high velocity emission arising from the forbidden transitions of [O I], [N II],

is the number of points on which the $n$th eigenfunction vanishes. We provide a
probabilistic setting using which we are able to define the nodal

of the nodal count statistics for large graphs and we prove it for a certain

  The second goal is to formulate and study the Neumann count, which is the
number of local extrema of the $n$th eigenfunction. This counting problem is
motivated by the Neumann partitions of planar domains, a novel concept in
spectral geometry. We provide uniform bounds on the Neumann count and
investigate its statistics. We show that the Neumann count provides

show that for a certain family of growing tree graphs the Neumann count
statistics approaches a Gaussian distribution.

eigenfunctions do not vanish on vertices. We generalize this result to
derivatives at vertices as well. That is, generically, the derivatives of an

previous works have mainly focused on membership inference attacks. In this
work, we explore one of the most severe attacks against machine learning

backdoor attack is a training time attack where the adversary implements a
hidden backdoor in the target model that can only be activated by a secret

We extend the applicability of backdoor attacks to autoencoders and GAN-based

autoencoders and GANs where the adversary can control what the decoded or
generated images are when the backdoor is activated. Our results show that the
adversary can build a backdoored autoencoder that returns a target output for
all backdoored inputs, while behaving perfectly normal on clean inputs.
Similarly, for the GANs, our experiments show that the adversary can generate
data from a different distribution when the backdoor is activated, while
maintaining the same utility when the backdoor is not.

zero field fixed point and the unitarity limit attractor. We present the
evolution equations in a form suitable for efficient numerical solution. Hence,
the proposed evolution equation in principle permits phenomenological

that there is normally a broadcast delay between the latest captured frame and

We propose to adopt the problem setting that allows models to make use of the

work has shown that this approach can degrade performance on high-resource
languages, a phenomenon known as negative interference. In this paper, we
present the first systematic study of negative interference. We show that,
contrary to previous belief, negative interference also impacts low-resource

structures, we demonstrate that language-specific parameters do exist in
multilingual models and they are a potential cause of negative interference.
Motivated by these observations, we also present a meta-learning algorithm that
obtains better cross-lingual transferability and alleviates negative

training them in a manner that explicitly improves shared layers'
generalization on all languages. Overall, our results show that negative

on various image and video understanding tasks using self-attention. However,
due to the quadratic computational and memory complexities of self-attention,
these works either apply attention only to low-resolution feature maps in later
stages of a deep network or restrict the receptive field of attention in each
layer to a small local region. To overcome these limitations, this work
introduces a new global self-attention module, referred to as the GSA module,
which is efficient enough to serve as the backbone component of a deep network.
This module consists of two parallel layers: a content attention layer that
attends to pixels based only on their content and a positional attention layer
that attends to pixels based on their spatial locations. The output of this
module is the sum of the outputs of the two layers. Based on the proposed GSA
module, we introduce new standalone global attention-based deep networks that
use GSA modules instead of convolutions to model pixel interactions. Due to the
global extent of the proposed GSA module, a GSA network has the ability to
model long-range pixel interactions throughout the network. Our experimental
results show that GSA networks outperform the corresponding convolution-based
networks significantly on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets while using less
parameters and computations. The proposed GSA networks also outperform various
existing attention-based networks on the ImageNet dataset.

fair division as well as large-scale Internet markets. In the
finite-dimensional case of $n$ buyers and $m$ items, a market equilibrium can
be computed using the Eisenberg-Gale convex program. Motivated by large-scale
Internet advertising and fair division applications, this paper considers a
generalization of a linear Fisher market where there is a finite set of buyers
and a continuum of items. We introduce generalizations of the Eisenberg-Gale
convex program and its dual to this infinite-dimensional setting, which leads
to Banach-space optimization problems. We establish existence of optimal
solutions, strong duality, as well as necessity and sufficiency of KKT-type
conditions. All these properties are established via non-standard arguments,
which circumvent the limitations of duality theory in optimization over
infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. Furthermore, we show that there exists a
pure equilibrium allocation, i.e., a division of the item space. When the item
space is a closed interval and buyers have piecewise linear valuations, we show
that the Eisenberg-Gale-type convex program over the infinite-dimensional
allocations can be reformulated as a finite-dimensional convex conic program,
which can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf optimization software based
on primal-dual interior-point methods. Based on our convex conic reformulation,
we develop the first polynomial-time cake-cutting algorithm that achieves
Pareto optimality, envy-freeness, and proportionality. For general buyer
valuations or a very large number of buyers, we propose computing market
equilibrium using stochastic dual averaging, which finds approximate
equilibrium prices with high probability. Finally, we discuss how the above
results easily extend to the case of quasilinear utilities.

address this challenge by tunnel field-effect transistors made of bilayer
graphene (BLG). Taking advantage of BLG's electrically tunable band structure,
we create a lateral tunnel junction and couple it to an antenna exposed to THz
radiation. The incoming radiation is then down-converted by the tunnel junction
nonlinearity, resulting in high-responsivity (> 4 kV/W) and low-noise (0.2
pW/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$}) detection. We demonstrate how switching from
intraband Ohmic to interband tunneling regime can raise detectors' responsivity
by few orders of magnitude, in agreement with the developed theory. Our work
demonstrates a potential application of tunnel transistors for THz detection
and reveals BLG as a promising platform therefor.

and metal-rich ([Z/H] $\sim -0.45$), respectively, and the GGCs are in between.
We find that the inner GC system exhibits a strong overall rotation that is
entirely due to a disk-like rotation of the RGC system. The BGC system shows
little rotation. The GGCs show kinematic properties clearly distinct among the
GC subpopulations, having higher mean velocities than the BGCs and RGCs and
being aligned along the major axis of M85. This implies that the GGCs have an
origin different from the other GC subpopulations. The rotation-corrected
velocity dispersion of the RGC system is much lower than that of the BGC
system, indicating the truncation of the red halo of M85. The BGCs have a flat
velocity dispersion profile out to $R$ = 67 kpc, reflecting the dark matter
extent of M85. Using the velocity dispersion of the BGC system, we estimate the

(TORs). As a complement, this exploratory study aimed to examine drivers'
psychophysiological responses to TORs as a result of varying
non-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), traffic density and TOR lead time. A total
number of 102 drivers were recruited and each of them experienced 8 takeover
events in a high fidelity fixed-base driving simulator. Drivers' gaze
behaviors, heart rate (HR) activities, galvanic skin responses (GSRs), and
facial expressions were recorded and analyzed during two stages. First, during
the automated driving stage, we found that drivers had lower heart rate
variability, narrower horizontal gaze dispersion, and shorter eyes-on-road time
when they had a high level of cognitive load relative to a low level of
cognitive load. Second, during the takeover transition stage, 4s lead time led
to inhibited blink numbers and larger maximum and mean GSR phasic activation
compared to 7s lead time, whilst heavy traffic density resulted in increased HR
acceleration patterns than light traffic density. Our results showed that
psychophysiological measures can indicate specific internal states of drivers,
including their workload, emotions, attention, and situation awareness in a
continuous, non-invasive and real-time manner. The findings provide additional
support for the value of using psychophysiological measures in automated
driving and for future applications in driver monitoring systems and adaptive

recently been discovered to display highly efficient quantum cutting, in which
the energy from individual blue or UV photons absorbed by the material is
re-emitted in the form of pairs of near-infrared photons by Yb3+ dopants.
Experimental photoluminescence quantum yields approaching 200{%} have been
reported. As the first quantum-cutting materials that combine such high
photoluminescence quantum yields with strong, broadband absorption in the
visible, these materials offer unique opportunities for enhancing the
efficiencies of solar technologies. Little is known about the fundamental
origins of this quantum cutting, however. Here, we describe
variable-temperature and time-resolved photoluminescence studies of
Yb3+:CsPbCl3 in two disparate forms - colloidal nanocrystals and macroscopic
single crystals. Both forms show very similar spectroscopic properties,
demonstrating that quantum cutting is an intrinsic property of the Yb3+:CsPbX3
composition itself. Diverse Yb3+ speciation is observed in both forms by
low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy, but remarkably, quantum cutting
is dominated by the same specific Yb3+ species in both cases. Time-resolved
photoluminescence measurements provide direct evidence of the previously
hypothesized intermediate state in the quantum-cutting mechanism. This
intermediate state mediates relaxation from the photogenerated excited state of
the perovskite to the emissive excited state of Yb3+, and hence is of critical
mechanistic importance. At room temperature, this intermediate state is
populated within a few picoseconds and has a decay time of only ~ 7 ns in both
nanocrystalline and single-crystal Yb3+:CsPbCl3. The mechanistic implications
of these observations are discussed.

  Each agent, say agent~$i$, updates its opinion~$x_i$ by taking the average
opinion of all its neighbors, the agents whose opinion differs from~$x_i$ by at
most~$\epsilon$.
  There are two types of~HK models: the synchronous~HK model and the
asynchronous~HK model.
  For the synchronous model, all the agents update their opinion simultaneously
at each time step, whereas for the asynchronous~HK model, only one agent chosen
uniformly at random updates its opinion at each time step.
  This paper is concerned with a variant of the~HK opinion dynamics, called the
mixed~HK model, where each agent can choose its degree of stubbornness and mix
its opinion with the average opinion of its neighbors at each update.
  The degree of the stubbornness of agents can be different and/or vary over
time.
  An agent is not stubborn or absolutely open-minded if its new opinion at each
update is the average opinion of its neighbors, and absolutely stubborn if its
opinion does not change at the time of the update.
  The particular case where, at each time step, all the agents are absolutely
open-minded is the synchronous~HK model.
  In contrast, the asynchronous model corresponds to the particular case where,
at each time step, all the agents are absolutely stubborn except for one agent
chosen uniformly at random who is absolutely open-minded.

such as finite-time convergence, do not hold for the mixed model.
  We then investigate conditions under which the asymptotic stability holds, or

determine the corresponding theoretical means, variances, and third central

the results obtained for various simulated and measured data sets, including
simulated particle trajectories of simple and anomalous diffusion, and the
measured trajectories of an optically-trapped bead in water, and in a
viscoelastic solution. We also show that, for sufficiently long tracks, each
covariance distribution in these examples is well-described by a skew-normal
distribution with mean, variance, and skewness given by theory. For
experimental S. pombe gene locus data, however, we find that the first two
covariance distributions are wider than predicted, although the third and
subsequent covariances are well-described by theory. This suggests that the
origin of the theory-experiment discrepancy is associated with localization
noise, which influences only the first two covariances. Thus, we hypothesize
that the discrepancy is caused by locus-to-locus heterogeneity in the
localization noise. Further simulations reveal excess covariance widths can be

gravitomagnetic forces in coalescing binary systems. The previous study by
Flanagan and Racine [Phys. Rev. D 75, 044001 (2007)] showed that this kind of
dynamical tide (DT) can induce phase shifts of 0.1 rad on gravitational
waveforms, which is detectable by third-generation (3G) detectors. In this
paper, we study the impact of this DT on measuring neutron-star parameters in
the era of 3G detectors. We incorporate two universal relations among neutron
star properties predicted by different equations of state: (i) the well-known
I-Love relation between momentum of inertia and (f-mode) tidal Love number, and
(ii) a relation between the r-mode overlap and tidal Love number, which is
newly explored in this paper. We find that r-mode DT will provide rich
information about slowly rotating neutron stars with frequency ranging from 10
to 100 Hz. For a binary neutron star system (with a signal-to-noise ratio
around 1500 in the Cosmic Explorer), the spin frequency of each individual
neutron star can be constrained to 6% (fractional error) in the best-case
scenario. The degeneracy between the Love numbers of individual neutron stars
is dramatically reduced: each individual Love number can be constrained to
around 20% in the best case, while the fractional error for both symmetric and
anti-symmetric Love numbers are reduced by factors of around 300. Furthermore,
DT also allows us to measure the spin inclination angles of the neutron stars,
to 0.09 rad in the best case, and thus place constraints on NS natal kicks and
supernova explosion models. Besides parameter estimation, we have also
developed a semi-analytic method that accurately describes detailed features of
the binary evolution that arise due to the DT.

to reveal underlying patterns, signatures, and critical components from
high-throughput biomolecular data. However, graphs do not natively capture the
multi-way relationships present among genes and proteins in biological systems.
Hypergraphs are generalizations of graphs that naturally model multi-way
relationships and have shown promise in modeling systems such as protein
complexes and metabolic reactions. In this paper we seek to understand how
hypergraphs can more faithfully identify, and potentially predict, important
genes based on complex relationships inferred from genomic expression data
sets.
  Results: We compiled a novel data set of transcriptional host response to
pathogenic viral infections and formulated relationships between genes as a
hypergraph where hyperedges represent significantly perturbed genes, and
vertices represent individual biological samples with specific experimental
conditions. We find that hypergraph betweenness centrality is a superior method
for identification of genes important to viral response when compared with
graph centrality.
  Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the utility of using hypergraphs to
represent complex biological systems and highlight central important responses
in common to a variety of highly pathogenic viruses.

\emph{Polyhedral reductions} are reductions where the input and output data

complexity). Yang, Atkinson and Carbin \cite{yang2020simplifying} extended this
to the case when (some) input values depend on (some) outputs. Specifically,
they showed how the optimal simplification problem could be formulated as a
bilinear programming problem, and for the case when the reduction operator

where the fluctuations induce spin and charge density wave instabilities for a
finite interval of order parameter fluctuation gaps at $T=0$. We restore a
subset of the diagrams suppressed in the $N_f\rightarrow0$ limit, all diagrams
with internal fermion loops with at most 2 vertices, and find that this does
not change the long-range behavior of correlators except right at the QCPs.

energy, electrons in two dimensional systems were predicted to spontaneously
break continuous translation symmetry and form a quantum crystal. Efforts to
observe this elusive state of matter, termed a Wigner crystal (WC), in two
dimensional extended systems have primarily focused on electrons confined to a
single Landau level at high magnetic fields, but have not provided a conclusive
experimental signature of the emerging charge order. Here, we use optical
spectroscopy to demonstrate that electrons in a pristine monolayer
semiconductor with density $ \lesssim 3 \cdot 10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ form a WC. The
interactions between resonantly injected excitons and electrons arranged in a
periodic lattice modify the exciton band structure so that it exhibits a new
umklapp resonance, heralding the presence of charge order. Remarkably, the
combination of a relatively high electron mass and reduced dielectric screening
allows us to observe an electronic WC state even in the absence of magnetic
field. The tentative phase diagram obtained from our Hartree-Fock calculations
provides an explanation of the striking experimental signatures obtained up to
$B = 16$ T. Our findings demonstrate that charge-tunable transition metal
dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers enable the investigation of previously
uncharted territory for many-body physics where interaction energy dominates
over kinetic energy, even in the absence of a moire potential or external

between circuit width and circuit depth. Unfortunately, this tradeoff still
limits the size of tractable problems since the increased depth is often not
realizable before noise dominates. Here, we develop qubit-efficient quantum
algorithms for entanglement spectroscopy which avoid this tradeoff. In
particular, we develop algorithms for computing the trace of the n-th power of
the density operator of a quantum system, $Tr(\rho^n)$, (related to the R\'enyi
entropy of order n) that use fewer qubits than any previous efficient algorithm
while achieving similar performance in the presence of noise, thus enabling
spectroscopy of larger quantum systems on NISQ devices. Our algorithms, which
require a number of qubits independent of n, are variants of previous
algorithms with width proportional to n, an asymptotic difference. The crucial
ingredient in these new algorithms is the ability to measure and reinitialize
subsets of qubits in the course of the computation, allowing us to reuse qubits
and increase the circuit depth without suffering the usual noisy consequences.
We also introduce the notion of effective circuit depth as a generalization of
standard circuit depth suitable for circuits with qubit resets. This tool helps
explain the noise-resilience of our qubit-efficient algorithms and should aid
in designing future algorithms. We perform numerical simulations to compare our
algorithms to the original variants and show they perform similarly when
subjected to noise. Additionally, we experimentally implement one of our
qubit-efficient algorithms on the Honeywell System Model H0, estimating
$Tr(\rho^n)$ for larger n than possible with previous algorithms.

the actual contact networks, or more realistic proxies for it. Moreover, CGEM
enables more precise modelling of enforcing and releasing different
non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) strategies. Through a set of extensive
experiments, we demonstrate significant differences between the epidemic curves
when assuming different underlying structures. More specifically we demonstrate
that the compartment-based models are overestimating the spread of the
infection by a factor of 3, and under some realistic assumptions on the
compliance factor, underestimating the effectiveness of some of NPIs,
mischaracterizing others (e.g. predicting a later peak), and underestimating

envisaged to play in the creation of next-generation satellite networks. To
begin with, the reader is introduced to the types of FSO links and
functionalities of a basic FSO system. Next, a comparison of FSO and radio
frequency (RF) technologies for inter-satellite links (ISLs) is provided,
including a comparison between FSO and RF links when employed between low Earth
orbit satellites. After that, the types of FSO or laser ISLs are considered,
and the challenges in establishing laser ISLs, the properties of laser ISLs,
and the capabilities of terminals for laser ISLs are discussed. Then, the
parameters of a satellite constellation are highlighted, and different aspects
of SpaceX's upcoming mega-constellation Starlink are explored. In addition, the
optical wireless satellite network that is created by utilizing laser ISLs is
examined. Finally, a use case is investigated for next-generation optical
wireless satellite networks that are envisioned by the mid to late 2020s.

highly non-trivial due to their exorbitant computational costs. A common remedy
to this is knowledge distillation (Hinton et al., 2015), leading to faster
inference. However -- as we show here -- existing works are not optimized for
dealing with pairs (or tuples) of texts. Consequently, they are either not
scalable or demonstrate subpar performance. In this work, we propose DiPair --
a novel framework for distilling fast and accurate models on text pair tasks.
Coupled with an end-to-end training strategy, DiPair is both highly scalable
and offers improved quality-speed tradeoffs. Empirical studies conducted on
both academic and real-world e-commerce benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed approach with speedups of over 350x and minimal quality drop

finds an upper bound on the treewidth and constructs a corresponding tree
decomposition as well. Our algorithm is a faster variation of Reed's classical
algorithm. For the benefit of the reader, and to be able to compare these two
algorithms, we start with a detailed time analysis of Reed's algorithm. We fill
in many details that have been omitted in Reed's paper. Computing tree
decompositions parameterized by the treewidth $k$ is fixed parameter tractable
(FPT), meaning that there are algorithms running in time $\mathcal{O}(f(k)
g(n))$ where $f$ is a computable function, and $g(n)$ is polynomial in $n$,
where $n$ is the number of vertices. An analysis of Reed's algorithm shows
$f(k) = 2^{\mathcal{O}(k \log k)}$ and $g(n) = n \log n$ for a 5-approximation.
Reed simply claims time $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ for bounded $k$ for his
constant factor approximation algorithm, but the bound of $2^{\Omega(k \log k)}
n \log n$ is well known. From a practical point of view, we notice that the
time of Reed's algorithm also contains a term of $\mathcal{O}(k^2 2^{24k} n
\log n)$, which for small $k$ is much worse than the asymptotically leading
term of $2^{\mathcal{O}(k \log k)} n \log n$. We analyze $f(k)$ more precisely,
because the purpose of this paper is to improve the running times for all
reasonably small values of $k$.
  Our algorithm runs in $\mathcal{O}(f(k)n\log{n})$ too, but with a much
smaller dependence on $k$. In our case, $f(k) = 2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}$. This
algorithm is simple and fast, especially for small values of $k$. We should
mention that Bodlaender et al. [2016] have an algorithm with a linear
dependence on $n$, and Korhonen [2021] obtains the much better approximation
ratio of 2, while the current paper achieves a better dependence on $k$.

  Inverse Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Driving behavior modeling is of great importance for designing safe, smart,
and personalized autonomous driving systems. In this paper, an internal reward
function-based driving model that emulates the human's decision-making
mechanism is utilized. To infer the reward function parameters from
naturalistic human driving data, we propose a structural assumption about human
driving behavior that focuses on discrete latent driving intentions. It
converts the continuous behavior modeling problem to a discrete setting and
thus makes maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) tractable to
learn reward functions. Specifically, a polynomial trajectory sampler is
adopted to generate candidate trajectories considering high-level intentions
and approximate the partition function in the maximum entropy IRL framework. An
environment model considering interactive behaviors among the ego and
surrounding vehicles is built to better estimate the generated trajectories.
The proposed method is applied to learn personalized reward functions for
individual human drivers from the NGSIM highway driving dataset. The
qualitative results demonstrate that the learned reward functions are able to
explicitly express the preferences of different drivers and interpret their
decisions. The quantitative results reveal that the learned reward functions
are robust, which is manifested by only a marginal decline in proximity to the
human driving trajectories when applying the reward function in the testing
conditions. For the testing performance, the personalized modeling method
outperforms the general modeling approach, significantly reducing the modeling
errors in human likeness (a custom metric to gauge accuracy), and these two
methods deliver better results compared to other baseline methods.

undergoing non-oscillatory change due to radiation emission. We show how the

distinguishability, of quantum states. It is shown that a necessary condition
of a local distinguishable state set is the total Schmidt rank not larger than
the system dimension. However, if we view states in a larger system, the
restriction will be invalid. Hence, a nature problem is that can
indistinguishable states become distinguishable by viewing them in a larger
system without employing extra resources. In this paper, we consider this
problem for (perfect or unambiguous) LOCC$_{1}$, PPT and SEP
distinguishabilities. We demonstrate that if a set of states is
indistinguishable in $\otimes _{k=1}^{K} C^{d _{k}}$, then it is
indistinguishable even being viewed in $\otimes _{k=1}^{K} C^{d _{k}+h _{k}}$,
where $K, d _{k}\geqslant2, h _{k}\geqslant0$ are integers. This shows that
such distinguishabilities are properties of states themselves and independent
of the dimension of quantum system. Our result gives the maximal numbers of
LOCC$_{1}$ distinguishable states and can be employed to construct a LOCC

  Combinatorics",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this short paper, we extend the concept of the strict order polynomial
$\Omega_{P}^{\circ}(n)$, which enumerates the number of strict order-preserving
maps $\phi:P\rightarrow\boldsymbol{n}$ for a poset $P$, to the extended strict
order polynomial $\text{E}_{P}^{\circ}(n,z)$, which enumerates analogous maps
for the elements of the power set $\mathcal{P}(P)$. The problem at hand
immediately reduces to the problem of enumeration of linear extensions for the
subposets of $P$. We show that for every $Q\subset P$ a given linear extension
$v$ of $Q$ can be associated with a unique linear extension $w$ of $P$. The
number of such linear extensions $v$ (of length $k$) associated with a given
linear extension $w$ of $P$ can be expressed compactly as
$\binom{\text{del}_{P}(w)}{k}$, where $\text{del}_{P}(w)$ is the number of
deletable elements of $w$ defined in the text. Consequently the extended strict
order polynomial $\text{E}_{P}^{\circ}(n,z)$ can be represented as $
\text{E}_{P}^{\circ}(n,z)=\sum_{w\in\mathcal{L}(P)}\sum_{k=0}^{p}\binom{\text{del}_{P}(w)}{p-k}\binom{n+\text{des}(w)}{k}z^{k}$.
The derived equation can be used for example for solving the following
combinatorial problem: Consider a community of $p$ shepherds, some of whom are
connected by a master-apprentice relation (expressed as a poset $P$). Every
morning, $k$ of the shepherds go out and each of them herds a flock of sheep.
Community tradition stipulates that each of these $k$ shepherds will herd at
least one and at most $n$ sheep, and an apprentice will always herd fewer sheep
than his master (or his master's master, etc). In how many ways can the flocks
be formed? The strict order polynomial answers this question for the case in
which all $p$ shepherds go to work, and the extended strict order polynomial
considers also all the situations in which some of the shepherds decide to take
a day off.

con-cerns on the future use of these dams. While being cost-effective, they
entail higher risks than conventional dams, as stability largely relies on the
strength of tailings, which are loose and normally-consolidated materials that
may exhibit strain-softening during un-drained loading. Current design practice
involves limit equilibrium analyses adopting a fully-softened shear strength;
while being conservative, this practice neglects the work input required to
start the softening process that leads to progressive failure. This paper
describes the calibration and application of the NGI-ADPSoft constitutive model
to evaluate the potential of static liquefaction of an upstream-raised TSF and
provides an indirect measure of resilience. The constitutive model incorporates
undrained shear strength anisotropy and a mesh-independent anisotropic
post-peak strain softening. The calibration is performed using laboratory
testing, including anisotropically-consolidated triaxial compression tests and
direct simple shear tests. The peak and residual undrained shear strengths are
validated by statistical interpretation of the available CPTu data. It is shown
that this numerical exercise is useful to verify the robustness of the TSF

interpretability in two aspects. On the one hand, the image-level
interpretability is achieved by generating localization heat maps of important

persists even in the absence of an external electric field. The coexistence of
ferroelectricity and metallicity in a material appears to be illusive, since
polarization is ill-defined in metals, where the itinerant electrons are
expected to screen the long-range dipole interactions necessary for dipole
ordering. The surprising discovery of the polar metal, LiOsO3 has generated
interest in searching for new polar metals motivated by the prospects of exotic
quantum phenomena such as unconventional pairing mechanisms giving rise to
superconductivity, topological spin currents, anisotropic upper critical
fields, and Mott multiferroics. Previous studies have suggested that the
coordination preferences of the Li atom play a key role in stabilizing the
polar metal phase of LiOsO3, but a thorough understanding of how polar order
and metallicity can coexist remains elusive. Here, we use XUV-SHG as novel
technique to directly probe the broken inversion-symmetry around the Li atom.
Our results agree with previous theories that the primary structural distortion
that gives rise to the polar metal phase in LiOsO3 is a consequence of a
sub-Angstrom Li atom displacement along the polar axis. A remarkable agreement
between our experimental results and ab initio calculations provide physical
insights for connecting the nonlinear response to unit-cell spatial
asymmetries. It is shown that XUV-SHG can selectively probe inversion-breaking
symmetry in a bulk material with elemental specificity. Compared to optical SHG
methods, XUV-SHG fills a key gap for studying structural asymmetries when the
structural distortion is energetically separated from the Fermi surface.
Further, these results pave the way for time-resolved probing of
symmetry-breaking structural phase transitions on femtosecond timescales with
element specificity.

mutual information between past and future windows at each time step. In
contrast to the mutual information lower bound commonly used by contrastive
learning, the estimate of predictive information we adopt is exact under a
Gaussian assumption. Additionally, it can be computed without negative
sampling. To reduce the degeneracy of the latent space extracted by powerful
encoders and keep useful information from the inputs, we regularize predictive
information learning with a challenging masked reconstruction loss. We
demonstrate that our method recovers the latent space of noisy dynamical
systems, extracts predictive features for forecasting tasks, and improves
automatic speech recognition when used to pretrain the encoder on large amounts
of unlabeled data.

Resequencing (DR)-based strategy is energy-optimal; both strategies perform
well in all metrics of interest. If the computation budget is adequate, the
MCTS strategy is recommended; otherwise, the DR strategy is preferable; 2) An
asymmetric intersection has a noticeable impact on the strategies, whereas the
influence of the arrival rates can be neglected. When the geometric shape is
asymmetrical, the modified First-In-First-Out (FIFO) strategy significantly
outperforms the FIFO strategy and works well when the traffic demand is
moderate, but their performances are similar in other situations; and 3)
Improving traffic efficiency sometimes comes at the cost of fairness, but the
DR and MCTS strategies can be adjusted to realize a better trade-off between
various performance metrics by appropriately designing their objective

little focus on verifying and ensuring the quality of the datasets, and on how
lower-quality data might affect GEC performance. We indeed found that there is
a non-negligible amount of ""noise"" where errors were inappropriately edited or

the key idea is to denoise these datasets by leveraging the prediction
consistency of existing models, and outperformed strong denoising baseline

state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL-2014, JFLEG, and BEA-2019 benchmarks.

  Generation over Knowledge Bases","Accepted by COLING 2020",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Question generation over knowledge bases (KBQG) aims at generating
natural-language questions about a subgraph, i.e. a set of (connected) triples.
Two main challenges still face the current crop of encoder-decoder-based
methods, especially on small subgraphs: (1) low diversity and poor fluency due
to the limited information contained in the subgraphs, and (2) semantic drift
due to the decoder's oblivion of the semantics of the answer entity. We propose
an innovative knowledge-enriched, type-constrained and grammar-guided KBQG
model, named KTG, to addresses the above challenges. In our model, the encoder
is equipped with auxiliary information from the KB, and the decoder is
constrained with word types during QG. Specifically, entity domain and
description, as well as relation hierarchy information are considered to
construct question contexts, while a conditional copy mechanism is incorporated
to modulate question semantics according to current word types. Besides, a
novel reward function featuring grammatical similarity is designed to improve
both generative richness and syntactic correctness via reinforcement learning.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed model outperforms existing methods
by a significant margin on two widely-used benchmark datasets SimpleQuestion
and PathQuestion.

considering that different KGs have their own strengths and limitations on data
quality and coverage. This is quite challenging, since the transfer of
knowledge among multiple independently maintained KGs is often hindered by the
insufficiency of alignment information and the inconsistency of described
facts. In this paper, we propose KEnS, a novel framework for embedding learning
and ensemble knowledge transfer across a number of language-specific KGs. KEnS
embeds all KGs in a shared embedding space, where the association of entities
is captured based on self-learning. Then, KEnS performs ensemble inference to
combine prediction results from embeddings of multiple language-specific KGs,
for which multiple ensemble techniques are investigated. Experiments on five
real-world language-specific KGs show that KEnS consistently improves
state-of-the-art methods on KG completion, via effectively identifying and
leveraging complementary knowledge.

domains where those networks excel, such as computer vision, or audio

heterogeneous tabular datasets domains remain underexplored despite their
prevalence. When searching for adversarial patterns within heterogeneous input
spaces, an attacker must simultaneously preserve the complex domain-specific
validity rules of the data, as well as the adversarial nature of the identified
samples. As such, applying adversarial manipulations to heterogeneous datasets
has proved to be a challenging task, and no generic attack method was suggested
thus far. We, however, argue that machine learning models trained on
heterogeneous tabular data are as susceptible to adversarial manipulations as
those trained on continuous or homogeneous data such as images. To support our
claim, we introduce a generic optimization framework for identifying
adversarial perturbations in heterogeneous input spaces. We define
distribution-aware constraints for preserving the consistency of the
adversarial examples and incorporate them by embedding the heterogeneous input
into a continuous latent space. Due to the nature of the underlying datasets We
focus on $\ell_0$ perturbations, and demonstrate their applicability in real

evaluate, and the user evaluates them and provides preferential feedback (i.e.,
picking the best melody among the candidates) to the system. This process is
iteratively performed based on BO techniques until the user finds the desired
melody. We conducted a pilot study using our prototype system, suggesting the
potential of this approach.

hierarchy, stem cells can undergo either asymmetric or symmetric divisions.
Recent studies pay special attention to the effect of different modes of stem
cell division on the lifetime risk of cancer, and report that symmetric
division is more beneficial to delay the onset of cancer. The fate uncertainty
of symmetric division is considered to be the reason for the cancer-delaying
effect. In this paper we compare asymmetric and symmetric divisions of stem
cells via studying stochastic stem cell models with mutations. Specially, by
using rigorous mathematical analysis we find that both asymmetric and symmetric
models show the same statistical average, but symmetric model shows higher
fluctuation than asymmetric model. We further show that the difference between
the two models would be more remarkable for lower mutation rates. Our work
quantifies the uncertainty of cell division and highlights the significance of
stochasticity for distinguishing between different modes of stem cell division.

This paper proposes a new compression technique called Hybrid Matrix
Factorization that achieves this dual objective. HMF improves low-rank matrix

intelligent hybrid-structure leading to better accuracy than LMF. Further, by
preserving dense matrices, it leads to faster inference run-time than pruning

  Optimization Approach",,,,,"math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  First-order algorithms have been popular for solving convex and non-convex
optimization problems. A key assumption for the majority of these algorithms is
that the gradient of the objective function is globally Lipschitz continuous,
but many contemporary problems such as tensor decomposition fail to satisfy
such an assumption. This paper develops a sequential local optimization (SLO)
framework of first-order algorithms that can effectively optimize problems
without Lipschitz gradient. Operating on the assumption that the gradients are
{\it locally} Lipschitz continuous over any compact set, the proposed framework
carefully restricts the distance between two successive iterates. We show that
the proposed framework can easily adapt to existing first-order methods such as
gradient descent (GD), normalized gradient descent (NGD), accelerated gradient
descent (AGD), as well as GD with Armijo line search. Remarkably, the latter
algorithm is totally parameter-free and do not even require the knowledge of
local Lipschitz constants.
  We show that for the proposed algorithms to achieve gradient error bound of
$\|\nabla f(x)\|^2\le \epsilon$, it requires at most
$\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\times \mathcal{L}(Y))$ total access to the
gradient oracle, where $\mathcal{L}(Y)$ characterizes how the local Lipschitz
constants grow with the size of a given set $Y$. Moreover, we show that the
variant of AGD improves the dependency on both $\epsilon$ and the growth
function $\mathcal{L}(Y)$. The proposed algorithms complement the existing
Bregman Proximal Gradient (BPG) algorithm, because they do not require the
global information about problem structure to construct and solve Bregman
proximal mappings.

counting the (equivalent) number of qubits transmitted during communication
cannot be directly used to measure the cost of such protocols, which use

In this paper, we provide a framework to understand the growth of physical

features, namely, sparse persistence image (PI) and amplitude, by applying
persistent homology to multi-directional height function-based filtrations of
the cubical complexes representing the object segmentation maps. The features
are then used to train a fully connected network for recognition. For
performance evaluation, in addition to a widely used shape dataset and a
benchmark indoor scenes dataset, we collect a new dataset, comprising scene
images from two different environments, namely, a living room and a mock
warehouse. The scenes are captured using varying camera poses under different
illumination conditions and include up to five different objects from a given

features show better recognition performance in unseen environments than the

Further, they provide slightly higher recall and accuracy values than Faster

gradient-based algorithms in linear minimax optimization problems;
specifically, our approach is based on the Z-transform, a powerful tool applied
in Control Theory and Signal Processing in order to characterize linear
discrete-time systems. We employ our framework to obtain the first tight
analysis of stability of Optimistic Gradient Descent/Ascent (OGDA), a natural
variant of Gradient Descent/Ascent that was shown to exhibit last-iterate
convergence in bilinear games by Daskalakis et al.
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1711-00141}. Importantly, our analysis is
considerably simpler and more concise than the existing ones.
  Moreover, building on the intuition of OGDA, we consider a general family of
gradient-based algorithms that augment the memory of the optimization through
multiple historical steps. We reduce the convergence -- to a saddle-point -- of
the dynamics in bilinear games to the stability of a polynomial, for which
efficient algorithmic schemes are well-established. As an immediate corollary,
we obtain a broad class of algorithms -- that contains OGDA as a special case
-- with a last-iterate convergence guarantee to the space of Nash equilibria of
the game.

(symmetric or antisymmetric) {\em Bell}-type state. We also suppose that the
perfectly reflecting plate oscillates adiabatically, with the field modes
satisfying the boundary conditions at the mirror surface at any given instant,
so that the time-dependence of the interaction Hamiltonian is entirely enclosed
in the instantaneous atoms-wall distance. Using time-dependent perturbation
theory, we investigate the spectrum of the radiation emitted by the two-atom

the emitted spectrum, which exhibits two lateral peaks not present in the case
of a static boundary. We also evaluate the transition rate to the collective
ground state of the two-atom system in both cases of the superradiant

in time, and that the presence of the oscillating mirror can enhance or inhibit
the decay rate compared to the case of atoms in vacuum space or near a static

understanding of driver behavior based on measurements and modeling is crucial
early in the development process. This paper presents a driver model through a
weighting process of visual guidance from the road ahead and haptic guidance
from a steering system for a lane-following task. The proposed weighting
process describes the interaction of a driver with the haptic guidance steering
and the driver reliance on it. A driving simulator experiment is conducted to
identify the model parameters for driving manually and with haptic guidance.
The proposed driver model matched the driver input torque with a satisfactory
goodness of fit among fourteen participants after considering the individual
differences. The validation results reveal that the simulated trajectory
effectively followed the driving course by matching the measured trajectory,
thereby indicating that the proposed driver model is capable of predicting
driver behavior during haptic guidance. Furthermore, the effect of different
degrees of driver reliance on driving performance is evaluated considering
various driver states and with system failure via numerical analysis. The model
evaluation results reveal the potential of the proposed driver model to be
applied in the design and evaluation of a haptic guidance system.

two main cases based on the symmetry of the effective Lagrangian of the BPS
submodels, i.e. the spherically symmetric and non-spherically symmetric cases.
For the spherically symmetric case, we find two BPS submodels. The first BPS
submodels consist of a potential term and a term proportional to the square of
the topological current. The second BPS submodels consist of only the Skyrme
term. The second BPS submodel has BPS skyrmions with the same topological
charge $B>1$, but with different energies, that we shall call ""topological

energies, if the topological charge is a prime number. Another interesting
feature of the BPS skyrmions, with $B>1$, in this BPS submodel, is that these
BPS skyrmions have non-zero pressures in the angular direction. For the
non-spherically symmetric case, there is only one BPS submodel, which is
similar to the first BPS submodel in the spherically symmetric case. We find
that the BPS skyrmions depend on a constant $k$ and for a particular value of
$k$ we obtain the BPS skyrmions of the first BPS submodel in the spherically

skyrmions also depend on this constant. We also show that all the results found

of their large-scale production and applications developed so far in the fields

structural variety of native sophorolipids is limited/restricted, a limiting
fact for the development of new properties and their potential applications. In
their open acidic form, C18:1 sophorolipids (SL) are classically composed of a
sophorose headgroup and a carboxylic acid (COOH) end-group. The carboxyl group
gives them unique pH-responsive properties, but they are a poorly-reactive
group and their charge can only be negative. To develop a new generation of
pH-responsive, positively-charged, SL and to improve their reactivity for
further functionalization, we develop here SLs with an amine (-NH2) or terminal
alkyne (-C$\not\equiv$CH) end-group analogues. The amine group generates
positively-charged SL and is more reactive than carboxylic acids, e.g. towards
aldehydes; the alkyne group provides access to copper-based click chemistry. In
this work, we synthesize (C18:1) and (C18:0) --NH2 and (C18:1) -C$\not\equiv$CH
sophorolipid derivatives and we study their self-assembly properties in

scattering, small angle (X-ray, neutron) scattering and cryogenic electron
microscopy. Monounsaturated aminyl SL-C18:1-NH2 sophorolipids form a micellar

composition and mass detection limits is required for a sufficiently large

radial-velocity (RV) programs. Based on the recently published archival

effects of stellar properties on planet occurrence rates and to obtain first
estimates of planet occurrence rates in the thin and thick disks of the Galaxy.
As a baseline for comparison, we also aim to provide an updated value for the
small close-in planet occurrence rate and compare it to results of previous RV
and transit ($\textit{Kepler}$) works. Methods. We used archival HARPS RV
datasets to calculate detection limits of a sample of stars that were
previously analysed for their elemental abundances. For stars with known
planets we first subtracted the Keplerian orbit. We then used this information

in different regimes of stellar and planet properties. Results. Our results
suggest that metal-poor stars and more massive stars host fewer low-mass
close-in planets. We find the occurrence rates of these planets in the thin and

discrepancy between offline evaluation and online metrics, hurting user

large volume of research models into practical improvements, it is highly
urgent to explore the impacts of the biases and perform debiasing when
necessary. When reviewing the papers that consider biases in RS, we find that,
to our surprise, the studies are rather fragmented and lack a systematic

its definition is usually vague and even inconsistent across papers. This
motivates us to provide a systematic survey of existing work on RS biases. In

position and organize the existing work on recommendation debiasing. Finally,
we identify some open challenges and envision some future directions, with the

progress into invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Studies suggest DCIS is often
overtreated since a considerable part of DCIS lesions may never progress into
IDC. Lower grade lesions have a lower progression speed and risk, possibly
allowing treatment de-escalation. However, studies show significant
inter-observer variation in DCIS grading. Automated image analysis may provide
an objective solution to address high subjectivity of DCIS grading by
pathologists.
  In this study, we developed a deep learning-based DCIS grading system. It was
developed using the consensus DCIS grade of three expert observers on a dataset
of 1186 DCIS lesions from 59 patients. The inter-observer agreement, measured
by quadratic weighted Cohen's kappa, was used to evaluate the system and
compare its performance to that of expert observers. We present an analysis of
the lesion-level and patient-level inter-observer agreement on an independent
test set of 1001 lesions from 50 patients.
  The deep learning system (dl) achieved on average slightly higher
inter-observer agreement to the observers (o1, o2 and o3)
($\kappa_{o1,dl}=0.81, \kappa_{o2,dl}=0.53, \kappa_{o3,dl}=0.40$) than the
observers amongst each other ($\kappa_{o1,o2}=0.58, \kappa_{o1,o3}=0.50,

  In conclusion, we developed a deep learning-based DCIS grading system that
achieved a performance similar to expert observers. We believe this is the
first automated system that could assist pathologists by providing robust and

not only more suitable for CVAE reconstruction but are also more separable
which improves classification accuracy. Moreover, we introduce Gaussian noise
to enlarge the intra-class variance of the generated features, which helps to
improve the classifier's robustness. Our experiments on SUN,CUB, and AWA2

costly. Recent advances in communication-efficient training algorithms have
reduced this bottleneck by using compression techniques, in the form of
sparsification, quantization, or low-rank approximation. Since compression is a
lossy, or inexact, process, the iteration complexity is typically worsened; but
the total communication complexity can improve significantly, possibly leading
to large computation time savings. In this paper, we investigate the
fundamental trade-off between the number of bits needed to encode compressed
vectors and the compression error. We perform both worst-case and average-case
analysis, providing tight lower bounds. In the worst-case analysis, we
introduce an efficient compression operator, Sparse Dithering, which is very
close to the lower bound. In the average-case analysis, we design a simple
compression operator, Spherical Compression, which naturally achieves the lower
bound. Thus, our new compression schemes significantly outperform the state of

The size of the search space we define is huge, so we further propose a novel

training a single GNN once. Compared with existing popular NAS algorithms, our
proposed search algorithm improves the search efficiency. We conduct extensive

Chern-Simons-Schr\""odinger (CSS) equation (also referred to as the Jackiw-Pi
model) near the radial soliton $Q$ with the least $L^{2}$-norm (ground state).
While a formal application of pseudoconformal symmetry to $Q$ gives rise to an
$L^{2}$-continuous curve of initial data sets whose solutions blow up in finite
time, they all have infinite energy due to the slow spatial decay of $Q$. In
this paper, we exhibit initial data sets that are smooth finite energy radial
perturbations of $Q$, whose solutions blow up in finite time. Interestingly,
their blow-up rate differs from the pseudoconformal rate by a power of
logarithm. Applying pseudoconformal symmetry in reverse, this also yields a
first example of an infinite-time blow-up solution, whose blow-up profile
contracts at a logarithmic rate.
  Our analysis builds upon the ideas of previous works of the first two authors
on (CSS) [21,22], as well as the celebrated works on energy-critical geometric
equations by Merle, Rapha\""el, and Rodnianski [33,38]. A notable feature of
this paper is a systematic use of nonlinear covariant conjugations by the
covariant Cauchy-Riemann operators in all parts of the argument. This not only
overcomes the nonlocality of the problem, which is the principal challenge for
(CSS), but also simplifies the structure of nonlinearity arising in the proof.

increased over the past few years, both in academia and industry. The release
of commercial VR Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) has been a major contributing
factor. However, there is still much to be learned, especially how views and
input techniques, as well as their interaction, affect the VR experience. There
is little work done on First-Person Shooter (FPS) games in VR, and those few
studies have focused on a single aspect of VR FPS. They either focused on the
view, e.g., comparing VR to a typical 2D display or on the controller types. To
the best of our knowledge, there are no studies investigating variations of
2D/3D views in HMDs, controller types, and their interactions. As such, it is
challenging to distinguish findings related to the controller type from those
related to the view. If a study does not control for the input method and finds
that 2D displays lead to higher performance than VR, we cannot generalize the
results because of the confounding variables. To understand their interaction,
we propose to analyze in more depth, whether it is the view (2D vs. 3D) or the
way it is controlled that gives the platforms their respective advantages. To
study the effects of the 2D/3D views, we created a 2D visual technique,
PlaneFrame, that was applied inside the VR headset. Our results show that the
controller type can have a significant positive impact on performance,
immersion, and simulator sickness when associated with a 2D view. They further
our understanding of the interactions that controllers and views have and
demonstrate that comparisons are highly dependent on how both factors go
together. Further, through a series of three experiments, we developed a
technique that can lead to a substantial performance, a good level of

whether a violation exists within certain bounds. However, individual ""yes or

model respects a higher-rank symmetry such that both particle numbers of each
component and angular charge moments are conserved quantities. By performing
the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approximation, we derive a set of Gross-Pitaevskii
equations and a Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian, which leads to a
unified description of gapless phonons and gapped rotons. With the
coherent-path-integral representation, we also derive the long-wavelength
effective field theory of gapless Goldstone modes and analyze quantum
fluctuations around classical ground states. The Euler-Lagrange equations and
Noether charges/currents are also studied. In two spatial dimensions and
higher, such an ODLRO stays stable against quantum fluctuations. Finally, we
study vortex configurations. The higher-rank symmetry enforces a hierarchy of
point vortex excitations whose structure is dominated by two guiding
statements. Specially, we construct two types of vortex excitations, the
conventional and dipole vortices. The latter carries a charge with dimension as
a momentum. The two statements can be more generally applicable. Several future
directions are discussed.

fashion. In this paper, we propose a deep latent variable model that first
samples a sequence of anchor words, one per sentence in the story, as part of
its generative process. During training, our model treats the sequence of
anchor words as a latent variable and attempts to induce anchoring sequences
that help guide generation in an unsupervised fashion. We conduct experiments
with several types of sentence decoder distributions: left-to-right and
non-monotonic, with different degrees of restriction. Further, since we use
amortized variational inference to train our model, we introduce two
corresponding types of inference network for predicting the posterior on anchor
words. We conduct human evaluations which demonstrate that the stories produced
by our model are rated better in comparison with baselines which do not
consider story plans, and are similar or better in quality relative to
baselines which use external supervision for plans. Additionally, the proposed
model gets favorable scores when evaluated on perplexity, diversity, and
control of story via discrete plan.

annotates multiple candidate explanations for each answer. The second dataset
eQASC-perturbed is constructed by crowd-sourcing perturbations (while
preserving their validity) of a subset of explanations in QASC, to test
consistency and generalization of explanation prediction models. The third
dataset eOBQA is constructed by adding explanation annotations to the OBQA

explore a delexicalized chain representation in which repeated noun phrases are
replaced by variables, thus turning them into generalized reasoning chains (for

investigated due to its severe security consequences. Current state-of-the-art
backdoor attacks require the adversary to modify the input, usually by adding a
trigger to it, for the target model to activate the backdoor. This added
trigger not only increases the difficulty of launching the backdoor attack in
the physical world, but also can be easily detected by multiple defense
mechanisms. In this paper, we present the first triggerless backdoor attack
against deep neural networks, where the adversary does not need to modify the
input for triggering the backdoor. Our attack is based on the dropout
technique. Concretely, we associate a set of target neurons that are dropped
out during model training with the target label. In the prediction phase, the
model will output the target label when the target neurons are dropped again,
i.e., the backdoor attack is launched. This triggerless feature of our attack
makes it practical in the physical world. Extensive experiments show that our
triggerless backdoor attack achieves a perfect attack success rate with a
negligible damage to the model's utility.

fundamental data stream problems such as computing the number of distinct
elements ($F_0$), frequency moments ($F_k$), and heavy-hitters. It can also be
applied to calculate the maximum frequency of an element ($F_{\infty}$).
  Given that exact computation of most of these special cases provably do not
admit any sublinear space algorithm, a natural approach is to consider them in
an enhanced data streaming model, where we have a computationally unbounded but
untrusted prover sending proofs or help messages to ease the computation. Think
of a memory-restricted client delegating the computation to a stronger cloud
service whom it doesn't want to trust blindly. Using its limited memory, it
wants to verify the proof that the cloud sends. Chakrabarti et al.~(ICALP '09)
introduced this setting as the ""annotated data streaming model"" and showed that
multiple problems including exact computation of frequency-based
functions---that have no sublinear algorithms in basic streaming---do have
annotated streaming algorithms, also called ""schemes"", with both space and
proof-length sublinear in the input size.
  We give a general scheme for computing any frequency-based function with both

improves upon the best known bounds for the important special cases of

targeted universal adversarial perturbations (DT-UAPs) to bridge the gap
between the instance-discriminative image-dependent perturbations and the
generic universal perturbations. This universal perturbation attacks one
targeted source class to sink class, while having a limited adversarial effect
on other non-targeted source classes, for avoiding raising suspicions.
Targeting the source and sink class simultaneously, we term it double targeted

PPO clips density ratio of the latest and baseline policies with a threshold,

symmetric threshold is given numerically while the density ratio itself is in
asymmetric domain, thereby causing unbalanced regularization of the policy.
This paper therefore proposes a new variant of PPO by considering a

This regularization yields the clear minimization target, which constrains the
latest policy to the baseline one. Through its analysis, the intuitive

a vector autoregressive process with exogenous variable (VARX), estimated from

different configurations of the 2-layer L96 model, one with common parameter
choices giving unimodal invariant probability distributions for the L96 model
variables, and one with non-standard parameters giving trimodal distributions.
We show through various statistical criteria that the proposed VARX performs
very well for the unimodal configuration, while keeping the number of

parameterization performs accurately for the very challenging trimodal L96
configuration by allowing for a dense (non-diagonal) VARX covariance matrix.

glass, measuring the third harmonics cubic susceptibility $\chi_3^{(3)}$ from
slightly below the usual glass transition temperature down to $10K$. According
to the mean field picture, if local motion within the glass were becoming
highly correlated due to the emergence of a Gardner phase then $\chi_3^{(3)}$,
which is analogous to the dynamical spin-glass susceptibility, should increase
and diverge at the Gardner transition temperature $T_G$. We find instead that
upon cooling $| \chi_3^{(3)} |$ decreases by several orders of magnitude and
becomes roughly constant in the regime $100K-10K$. We rationalize our findings
by assuming that the low temperature physics is described by localized
excitations weakly interacting via a spin-glass dipolar pairwise interaction in
a random magnetic field. Our quantitative estimations show that the spin-glass
interaction is twenty to fifty times smaller than the local random field
contribution, thus rationalizing the absence of the spin-glass Gardner phase.
This hints at the fact that a Gardner phase may be suppressed in standard
molecular glasses, but it also suggests ways to favor its existence in other
amorphous solids and by changing the preparation protocol.

Then, the factor matrix with target DOA information is obtained by the tensor
decomposition via alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm, and subsequently
the DOA estimation is converted into the independent minimization problem. By
exploiting the Vandermonde structure of the transmit steering vector, a
polynomial function is constructed to solve the minimization problem via
polynomial rooting. The factor matrix contained in the coefficients of the
polynomial can be regarded as a block matrix in the generalized sidelobe
canceller (GSC), which accordingly forms a unique deep null in the direction of
target in the transmit beampattern. The proposed method can obtain the DOA
estimation without the requirements of spectrum searching or transmit beamspace
matrix design, which is different from the conventional DOA estimation
techniques. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by the

inequalities involving the mass. In particular, it is shown that the mass is
bounded from below by an integral functional over a marginally outer trapped

this main inequality, by choosing the free data in an appropriate way, one
obtains a new nontrivial bounds of the mass in terms of the inner expansion of
the MOTS. The analysis makes use of a new formalism for the $1+1+2$

consequence of the limited sensitivity of this survey, the 78 detected

population. Still, numerical modelling allows us to study the VHE $\gamma$-ray
source population in the Milky Way based on this sample. In this work, several
azimuth-symmetric and spiral-arm models are compared for spatial source
distribution. The luminosity and radius function of the population are derived
from the source properties of the HGPS data set and are corrected for the
sensitivity bias of the HGPS. Based on these models, VHE source populations are
simulated and the subsets of sources detectable according to the HGPS are
compared with HGPS sources. The power-law indices of luminosity and radius
functions are determined to range between $-1.6$ and $-1.9$ for luminosity and
$-1.1$ and $-1.6$ for radius. Azimuth-symmetric distributions and a
distribution following a four-arm spiral structure without Galactic bar
describe the HGPS data reasonably well. The total number of Galactic VHE
sources is predicted to be in the range from 800 to 7000 with a total
luminosity and flux of $(1.6-6.3) \cdot 10^{36}$~ph~s$^{-1}$ and $(3-15) \cdot

sample accounts for $(68-87)\%$ of the emission of the population in the

component of the diffuse emission measurable in the HGPS. With the foreseen

TeamLTL and identify its undecidability frontier. In particular, we show

  Variation with Application to Disturbance Recovery","38 pages, 8 figures",,,,"math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider a parameter dependent vector field on either Euclidean space or a
compact Riemannian manifold. Suppose that it possesses a parameter dependent
initial condition and a parameter dependent stable hyperbolic equilibrium
point. It is valuable to determine the set of parameter values, which we call
the recovery set, whose corresponding initial conditions lie within the region
of attraction of the corresponding stable equilibrium point. A boundary
parameter value is a parameter value whose corresponding initial condition lies
in the boundary of the region of attraction of the corresponding stable
equilibrium point. Prior algorithms numerically estimated the recovery set by
estimating its boundary via computation of boundary parameter values. The
primary purpose of this work is to provide theoretical justification for those
algorithms for a large class of parameter dependent vector fields. This
includes proving that, for these vector fields, the boundary of the recovery
set consists of boundary parameter values, and that the properties exploited by
the algorithms to compute these desired boundary parameters will be satisfied.
The main technical result which these proofs rely on is establishing that the
region of attraction boundary varies continuously in an appropriate sense with
respect to small variation in parameter value for this class of vector fields.
Hence, the majority of this work is devoted to proving this result, which may
be of independent interest. The proof of continuity proceeds by proving that,
for this class of vector fields, the region of attraction permits a
decomposition into a union of the stable manifolds of the equilibrium points
and periodic orbits it contains, and this decomposition persists under small
perturbations to the vector field.

is a fundamental task in machine learning. A key concern is the efficiency of
evaluating the expressions and their derivatives that hinges on the
representation of these expressions. Recently, an algorithm for computing
higher order derivatives of tensor expressions like Jacobians or Hessians has
been introduced that is a few orders of magnitude faster than previous
state-of-the-art approaches. Unfortunately, the approach is based on Ricci
notation and hence cannot be incorporated into automatic differentiation
frameworks from deep learning like TensorFlow, PyTorch, autograd, or JAX that
use the simpler Einstein notation. This leaves two options, to either change
the underlying tensor representation in these frameworks or to develop a new,
provably correct algorithm based on Einstein notation. Obviously, the first
option is impractical. Hence, we pursue the second option. Here, we show that
using Ricci notation is not necessary for an efficient tensor calculus and
develop an equally efficient method for the simpler Einstein notation. It turns
out that turning to Einstein notation enables further improvements that lead to
even better efficiency.
  The methods that are described in this paper have been implemented in the
online tool www.MatrixCalculus.org for computing derivatives of matrix and

interest in the ML community to understand the impact of BN on DNNs, especially
related to the model robustness. This work attempts to understand the impact of

improved accuracy can be attributed to the better utilization of useful
features. It remains unclear whether BN mainly favors learning robust features

supports that BN shifts a model towards being more dependent on NRFs. To
facilitate the analysis of such a feature robustness shift, we propose a
framework for disentangling robust usefulness into robustness and usefulness.
Extensive analysis under the proposed framework yields valuable insight on the
DNN behavior regarding robustness, e.g. DNNs first mainly learn RFs and then
NRFs. The insight that RFs transfer better than NRFs, further inspires simple
techniques to strengthen transfer-based black-box attacks.

that metabolic heterogeneity may result from the inherent stochasticity of

purely deterministic process, on the basis that highly abundant metabolites
tend to filter out stochastic phenomena. Here we bridge this gap with a general
method for prediction of metabolite distributions across single cells. By
exploiting the separation of time scales between enzyme expression and enzyme
kinetics, our method produces estimates for metabolite distributions without
the lengthy stochastic simulations that would be typically required for large
metabolic models. The metabolite distributions take the form of Gaussian
mixture models that are directly computable from single-cell expression data
and standard deterministic models for metabolic pathways. The proposed mixture
models provide a systematic method to predict the impact of biochemical

new approach which better approximates third virial coefficients of
two-dimensional hard particles. By varying some of their geometrical parameters
kites can be transformed into squares, rhombuses, triangles, and also very
elongated particles, even reaching the hard-needle limit. Thus a fluid of hard
kites, depending on the particle shape, can stabilize isotropic, nematic,
tetratic and triatic phases. Different phase diagrams are calculated, including
those of rhombuses, and kites with two of their equal interior angles fixed to
$90^{\circ}$, $60^{\circ}$ and $75^{\circ}$. Kites with one of their unequal
angles fixed to $72^{\circ}$, which have been recently studied via Monte Carlo
simulations, are also considered. We find that rhombuses and kites with two
equal right angles and not too large anisometry stabilise the tetratic phase
but the latter stabilize it to a much higher degree. By contrast, kites with
two equal interior angles fixed to $60^{\circ}$ stabilize the triatic phase to
some extent, although it is very sensitive to changes in particle geometry.
Kites with the two equal interior angles fixed to $75^{\circ}$ have a phase
diagram with both tetratic and triatic phases, but we show the nonexistence of
a particle shape for which both phases are stable at different densities.
Finally the success of the new theory in the description of orientational order
in kites is shown by comparing with Monte Carlo simulations for the case where
one of the unequal angles is fixed to $72^{\circ}$. These particles also
present phase diagrams with stable tetratic and triatic phases.

cloud model for the possibility of Turing instabilities. For this purpose, the
model is extended by diffusion terms. We can show that for some cloud models,
i.e special cases of the generic model, no Turing instabilities are possible.
However, we also present a general class of cloud models, where Turing
instabilities can occur. A key requisite is the occurrence of (weakly)
nonlinear terms for accretion. Using numerical simulations for a special case
of the general class of cloud models, we show spatial patterns of clouds in one
and two spatial dimensions. From the numerical simulations we can see that the
competition between collision terms and sedimentation is an important issue for
the existence of pattern formation.

However, this information is embedded into images, making it difficult to
extract and process for downstream tasks. In this paper, we present an
end-to-end approach that classifies promotions within digital leaflets into
their corresponding product categories using both visual and textual
information. Our approach can be divided into three key components: 1) region
detection, 2) text recognition and 3) text classification. In many cases, a
single promotion refers to multiple product categories, so we introduce a
multi-label objective in the classification head. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach for two separated tasks: 1) image-based detection
of the descriptions for each individual promotion and 2) multi-label
classification of the product categories using the text from the product
descriptions. We train and evaluate our models using a private dataset composed
of images from digital leaflets obtained by Nielsen. Results show that we
consistently outperform the proposed baseline by a large margin in all the

able to determine location, altitude, internal and external temperature and air

include an earth observation vegetation sensor, particle sample return,
gamma-ray detector, and air-bag landing system. The instructors play the role
of customer and launch authority. The students are provided with a number of
standard components including a Raspberry Pi single-board computer, a 5000 mAH
battery, high-altitude-compatible GPS unit, temperature and pressure sensors
and, a small low-power radio transceiver module developed specifically for the
course based on the LoRa standard. Teams are given a budget of EUR 100 ($115)
to purchase additional materials and to build their payload. The students learn
space industry practices by full immersion in a typical space project
development cycle. TupperSat design and payload concepts are pitched by the
student teams at a Preliminary Design Review; plans are well developed before a
Critical Design Review, and the team must pass a Flight Readiness Review before
being granted permission to launch. Good project management is crucial in order
to meet deadlines and secure a launch at the end of the term. As student
participation has grown, the module has been modified to allow for more
ambitious and challenging projects which further motivates the students.

Unfortunately, not much is known about the relation between flares and CMEs in
M-stars as only very few CMEs have so far been observed in M-stars. In order to
learn more about flares and CMEs on M-stars we monitored the active M-star EV
Lac spectroscopically at high resolution. We find 27 flares with energies
between 1.6E31 and 1.4E32 erg in Halpha during 127 hours of spectroscopic
monitoring and 49 flares with energies between 6.3E31 and 1.1E33 erg during the
457 hours of TESS observation. Statistical analysis shows that the ratio of the
continuum flux in the TESS-band to the energy emitted in Halpha is 10.408 +/-
0.026. Analysis of the spectra shows an increase in the flux of the He II 4686
{\AA} line during the impulsive phase of some flares. In three large flares, we
detect a continuum source with a temperature between 6 900 and 23 000 K. In
none of the flares we find a clear CME event indicating that these must be very
rare in active M-stars. However, in one relatively weak event, we found an

achieve a higher order momentum space convergence by extending to second degree

  However, the reality is bleak: centralization is reigning in the cyberspace,
with huge technological corporations controlling our data, and
re-intermediation and control are stronger than ever in the so-called ""sharing""

imposing heavy controls to information and communication services.
  The XXI century will witness the major clash between centralization and
decentralization in human history. And the major struggle will be around the
communication and feedback technologies that will intermediate and govern every
interaction in our lives.
  Unlike previous approaches that propose to socialize the feedback
infrastructure or to use anti-monopoly laws to break Big Tech companies, in
this article we advocate for the decentralization of the information and
communication infrastructure. And the key to this decentralization is the
creation of standards enabling interoperability between data platforms. This
will in turn produce a true disintermediation from well established
technological players and open competition to small third parties. In this

communication, sharing, matchmaking, and reputation services that can be
constructed over open source technologies and standards.

perturbed by magnetoacoustic waves which are abundantly present in the corona,
causing a misbalance between the heating and cooling rates. Due to this
misbalance, the wave experiences a back-reaction, either losing or gaining
energy from the energy supply that heats the plasma, at the time scales
comparable to the wave period. In particular, the plasma can be subject to
wave-induced instability or over-stability, depending on the specific choice of
the coronal heating function. In the unstable case, the coronal thermal
equilibrium would be violently destroyed, which does not allow for the
existence of long-lived plasma structures typical for the corona. Based on
this, we constrained the coronal heating function using observations of slow
magnetoacoustic waves in various coronal plasma structures.

physically-motivated constraints, we develop an efficient learning algorithm
which automates the construction of approximate free energy functionals. In
contrast to optimisation-based machine learning approaches, which seek to
minimise a cost function, the central idea of the proposed Bayesian inference
is to propagate a set of prior assumptions through the model, derived from
physical principles. The experimental data is used to probabilistically weigh
the possible model predictions. This naturally leads to humanly interpretable
algorithms with full uncertainty quantification of predictions. In our case,
the output of the learning algorithm is a probability distribution over a
family of free energy functionals, consistent with the observed particle data.
We find that surprisingly small data samples contain sufficient information for
inferring highly accurate analytic expressions of the underlying free energy
functionals, making our algorithm highly data efficient. We consider excluded
volume particle interactions, which are ubiquitous in nature, whilst being
highly challenging for modelling in terms of free energy. To validate our
approach we consider the paradigmatic case of one-dimensional fluid and develop
inference algorithms for the canonical and grand-canonical
statistical-mechanical ensembles. Extensions to higher-dimensional systems are
conceptually straightforward, whilst standard coarse-graining techniques allow
one to easily incorporate attractive interactions.

elements supercommuting with the Dunkl--Dirac operator and its dual symbol.
This symmetry algebra is realised inside the tensor product of a Clifford

magnetic fields. Owing to their minuscule strength, primordial magnetic fields
are very hard to detect in cosmological and astrophysical observations. We show
how this changes if a part of neutral Dark Matter has a magnetic
susceptibility. In this way, by studying Dark Matter one can obtain information
about the properties of primordial magnetic fields, even if the latter have a
comoving amplitude $B_0 \lesssim0.01~\mbox{nG}$. In our model Dark Matter is a
stable singlet scalar $\chi$, which interacts with electromagnetism through the
Rayleigh operator as $\chi^2 F_{\mu \nu} F^{\mu \nu}/\Lambda^2$. For primordial
magnetic fields present in the early Universe this operator forces the
$Z_2$-symmetry of the model to be spontaneously broken. Later, when the
primordial magnetic field redshifts below a critical value, the symmetry is
restored through an ""inverse phase transition"". At that point the field $\chi$
begins to oscillate and acts as a ""magnetomorphic"" Dark Matter component,
inheriting the properties of the primordial magnetic field space distribution.
In particular, for a nearly flat spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations, the
scalar $\chi$ carries a statistically anisotropic isocurvature mode. We discuss
the parameter space of the model and consider the possibility that the bulk of
the Dark Matter is composed of the same particles $\chi$ produced via the
freeze-in mechanism.

determine the performance and the safety of crowded structures. In conventional
cellular automata systems, all the cells are of the size of a typical
pedestrian. The free flow speed of a pedestrian is around 1.3m/s, and the
typical size of a cell in conventional CA models is around 45cm. In order to
maintain the upper boundary of movement speed, pedestrians should move 0, 1, 2
or 3 cells at each second in the simulation. These limited number of speed
values pose a limitation on the accuracy of the simulated speed of pedestrians.
Movement speed of pedestrians on a slope depends on the angel of the slope. The
conventional CA limitations do not allow accurate simulation of pedestrian
movements on slopes with different angels. Fine grid cellular automata model
uses much smaller cells (e.g. 5cm or smaller). The model therefore allows much
more possible speed values. In this article, fine grid cellular automata model

from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$. For a fixed graph $H$, in the list homomorphism problem,
denoted by LHom($H$), we are given a graph $G$, whose every vertex $v$ is
equipped with a list $L(v) \subseteq V(H)$. We ask if there exists a
homomorphism $f$ from $G$ to $H$, in which $f(v) \in L(v)$ for every $v \in

time-solvable if $H$ is a bi-arc-graph, and NP-complete otherwise.
  We are interested in the complexity of the LHom($H$) problem in graphs
excluding a copy of some fixed graph $F$ as an induced subgraph. It is known
that if $F$ is connected and is not a path nor a subdivided claw, then for
every non-bi-arc graph the LHom($H$) problem is NP-complete and cannot be
solved in subexponential time, unless the ETH fails. We consider the remaining
cases for connected graphs $F$.
  If $F$ is a path, we exhibit a full dichotomy. We define a class called
predacious graphs and show that if $H$ is not predacious, then for every fixed
$t$ the LHom($H$) problem can be solved in quasi-polynomial time in $P_t$-free
graphs. On the other hand, if $H$ is predacious, then there exists $t$, such
that LHom($H$) cannot be solved in subexponential time in $P_t$-free graphs.
  If $F$ is a subdivided claw, we show a full dichotomy in two important cases:
for $H$ being irreflexive (i.e., with no loops), and for $H$ being reflexive
(i.e., where every vertex has a loop). Unless the ETH fails, for irreflexive
$H$ the LHom($H$) problem can be solved in subexponential time in graphs
excluding a fixed subdivided claw if and only if $H$ is non-predacious and
triangle-free. If $H$ is reflexive, then LHom($H$) cannot be solved in
subexponential time whenever $H$ is not a bi-arc graph.

nonsymptomatic contacts are fundamental strategies for mitigating the current
COVID-19 pandemic. The breaking of contagion chains relies on two complementary
strategies: manual reconstruction of contacts based on interviews and a digital
(app-based) privacy-preserving contact tracing. We compare their effectiveness
using model parameters tailored to describe SARS-CoV-2 diffusion within the
activity-driven model, a general empirically validated framework for network
dynamics. We show that, even for equal probability of tracing a contact, manual
tracing robustly performs better than the digital protocol, also taking into
account the intrinsic delay and limited scalability of the manual procedure.
This result is explained in terms of the stochastic sampling occurring during
the case-by-case manual reconstruction of contacts, contrasted with the
intrinsically prearranged nature of digital tracing, determined by the decision
to adopt the app or not by each individual. The better performance of manual
tracing is enhanced by heterogeneity in agent behavior: superspreaders not
adopting the app are completely invisible to digital contact tracing, while
they can be easily traced manually, due to their multiple contacts. We show
that this intrinsic difference makes the manual procedure dominant in realistic
hybrid protocols.

pairwise interactions, where links describe dyadic connections among
individuals. However, many network dynamics are hardly ascribable to pairwise
settings but often comprise larger groups, which are better described by
higher-order interactions. Here we investigate the higher-order organizations
of temporal social networks by analyzing three publicly available datasets
collected in different social settings. We find that higher-order interactions
are ubiquitous and, similarly to their pairwise counterparts, characterized by
heterogeneous dynamics, with bursty trains of rapidly recurring higher-order
events separated by long periods of inactivity. We investigate the evolution
and formation of groups by looking at the transition rates between different
higher-order structures. We find that in more spontaneous social settings,
group are characterized by slower formation and disaggregation, while in work
settings these phenomena are more abrupt, possibly reflecting pre-organized
social dynamics. Finally, we observe temporal reinforcement suggesting that the
longer a group stays together the higher the probability that the same
interaction pattern persist in the future. Our findings suggest the importance

own or in combination with mechanistic models. Commonly, the trained models are
subsequently used in model-based optimization of design and/or operation of
processes. Thus, it is critical to ensure that data-driven models are not
evaluated outside their validity domain during process optimization. We propose
a method to learn this validity domain and encode it as constraints in process
optimization. We first perform a topological data analysis using persistent
homology identifying potential holes or separated clusters in the training
data. In case clusters or holes are identified, we train a one-class
classifier, i.e., a one-class support vector machine, on the training data
domain and encode it as constraints in the subsequent process optimization.
Otherwise, we construct the convex hull of the data and encode it as
constraints. We finally perform deterministic global process optimization with
the data-driven models subject to their respective validity constraints. To
ensure computational tractability, we develop a reduced-space formulation for
trained one-class support vector machines and show that our formulation
outperforms common full-space formulations by a factor of over 3,000, making it
a viable tool for engineering applications. The method is ready-to-use and
available open-source as part of our MeLOn toolbox

without a simulation. Using model potentials we test computational efficiency
of the methods, and the accuracy with which they reproduce the dominant
eigenfunctions and eigenvalues. For these model potentials, rate matrices with

estimation is highly desirable for this problem, the methods above do not

oil recovery factor estimation using reservoir parameters and representative
statistics. We apply advanced machine learning methods to historical worldwide
oilfields datasets (more than 2000 oil reservoirs). The data-driven model might
be used as a general tool for rapid and completely objective estimation of the
oil recovery factor. In addition, it includes the ability to work with partial
input data and to estimate the prediction interval of the oil recovery factor.
We perform the evaluation in terms of accuracy and prediction intervals
coverage for several tree-based machine learning techniques in application to
the following two cases: (1) using parameters only related to geometry,
geology, transport, storage and fluid properties, (2) using an extended set of
parameters including development and production data. For both cases model

data-driven approach overcomes several limitations of the traditional methods

concerning the appearance of relative translation and the motion's
time-reversibility. We demonstrate the applicability of the conclusions in
three specific examples: (a) two spheres driven parallel to a wall; (b) two

a possible use of nonlinear hydrodynamic interactions to disperse or assemble

the canonical action of the Coxeter group on its Cayley graph induces a natural

solutions to these relaxed problems may not be feasible with respect to the
full nonconvex physics. In this paper, it is shown that, in fact, the original
mixed-integer nonconvex program can be reformulated exactly as an MICP.
Beginning with a convex program previously used for proving nonlinear network
design feasibility, strong duality is invoked to construct a novel, convex

high-dielectric solvent from the low-dielectric solutes. With such a setting,
we construct an effective electrostatic free-energy functional of ionic
concentrations, where the solute point charges are regularized by a reaction
field. We prove that such a functional admits a unique minimizer in a class of
admissible ionic concentrations and that the corresponding electrostatic
potential is the unique solution to the boundary-value problem of the
dielectric-boundary PB equation. The negative first variation of this minimum
free energy with respect to variations of the dielectric boundary defines the
normal component of the dielectric boundary force. Together with the
solute-solvent interfacial tension and van der Waals interaction forces, such
boundary force drives an underlying charged molecular system to a stable
equilibrium, as described by a variational implicit-solvent model. We develop
an $L^2$-theory for the continuity and differentiability of solutions to
elliptic interface problems with respect to boundary variations, and derive an
explicit formula of the dielectric boundary force. With a continuum
description, our result of the dielectric boundary force confirms a
molecular-level prediction that the electrostatic force points from the
high-dielectric and polarizable aqueous solvent to the charged molecules. Our
method of analysis is general as it does not rely on any variational
principles.

  algorithms",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the field of machine learning there is a growing interest towards more
robust and generalizable algorithms. This is for example important to bridge
the gap between the environment in which the training data was collected and
the environment where the algorithm is deployed. Machine learning algorithms
have increasingly been shown to excel in finding patterns and correlations from
data. Determining the consistency of these patterns and for example the
distinction between causal correlations and nonsensical spurious relations has
proven to be much more difficult. In this paper a regularization scheme is
introduced that prefers universal causal correlations. This approach is based
on 1) the robustness of causal correlations and 2) the data not being
independently and identically distribute (i.i.d.). The scheme is demonstrated
with a classification task by clustering the (non-i.i.d.) training set in
subpopulations. A non-i.i.d. regularization term is then introduced that
penalizes weights that are not invariant over these clusters. The resulting
algorithm favours correlations that are universal over the subpopulations and
indeed a better performance is obtained on an out-of-distribution test set with
respect to a more conventional l_2-regularization.

demands depend on a traffic situation, the overhead wire DC electrical circuit
is associated with a non-linear power flow problem. Although the Newton-Raphson
method is well-known and widely accepted for seeking its solution, the
existence of such a solution is not guaranteed. Particularly in situations
where the vehicle power demands are too high (during acceleration), the
solution of the studied problem may not exist. To deal with such cases, we
introduce a numerical method which seeks maximal suppliable power demands for
which the solution exists. This corresponds to introducing a scaling parameter
to reduce the demanded power. The interpretation of the scaling parameter is
the amount of energy which is absent in the system, and which needs to be
provided by external sources such as on-board batteries. We propose an
efficient two-stage algorithm to find the optimal scaling parameter and the
resulting potentials in the overhead wire network. We perform a comparison with
a naive approach and present a real-world simulation of part of the Pilsen city

governed by the local Hund's coupling. For small values of the coupling,
magnetic fluctuations are anisotropic in orbital space, which reflects the
symmetry of the considered $t_{2g}$ model. Large Hund's coupling enhances
collective spin excitations, which mixes orbital and spatial degrees of
freedom, and magnetic fluctuations become orbitally isotropic. Remarkably, this
effect can be seen only in two-particle quantities; single-particle observables
remain anisotropic for any value of the Hund's coupling. Importantly, we find
that the orbital isotropy can be induced both, at half-filling and for the case
of $4$ electrons per lattice site, where the magnetic instability is associated
with different, antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic modes, respectively.

fields in order to study how information spreads in social networks. While
previously the attention was mostly on efficiency, more recently fairness
issues have been taken into account in this scope. In this paper, we propose to
use randomization as a mean for achieving fairness. Similar to previous works
like Fish et al. (WWW '19) and Tsang et al. (IJCAI '19), we study the maximin
criterion for (group) fairness. In contrast to their work however, we model the
problem in such a way that, when choosing the seed sets, probabilistic
strategies are possible rather than only deterministic ones. We introduce two
different variants of this probabilistic problem, one that entails
probabilistic strategies over nodes (node-based problem) and a second one that
entails probabilistic strategies over sets of nodes (set-based problem). While
the original deterministic problem involving the maximin criterion has been
shown to be inapproximable, interestingly, we show that both probabilistic
variants permit approximation algorithms that achieve a constant multiplicative
factor of 1-1/e plus an additive arbitrarily small error that is due to the
simulation of the information spread. For an experimental study, we provide
implementations of multiplicative-weight routines for both problems and compare
the achieved fairness values to existing methods. Maybe non-surprisingly, we
show that the ex-ante values of the computed probabilistic strategies are
significantly larger than the (ex-post) fairness values of previous methods.
This indicates that studying fairness via randomization is a worthwhile path to
follow. Interestingly and maybe more surprisingly, we observe that even the
ex-post fairness values computed by our routines, dominate over the fairness
achieved by previous methods on most of the instances tested.

the imposed symmetry is broken spontaneously. The real (CP even) parts of the

One of these physical mass eigenstates is attributed to the SM like Higgs boson

early Universe due to the breaking of discrete $\mathcal{Z}_2 \times

potential to the Lagrangian. The unstable annihilating domain walls produce a
significant amount of gravitational waves (GWs). In addition, we also explore
the possibility of the production of GW emission from the strong first-order
phase transition. We calculate the intensities and frequencies of each of such
gravitational waves originating from two different phenomena of the early

transition. Finally, we investigate the observational signatures from these GWs

to the termination analysis of probabilistic while-programs whose guards and
expressions are polynomial expressions. As proving (positive) AST is
undecidable in general, existing proof rules typically provide sufficient

consider four proof rules from the literature and extend these with
generalizations of existing proof rules for (P)AST. We automate the resulting
set of proof rules by effectively computing asymptotic bounds on polynomials

  Conversational Speech","To appear in Interspeech 2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Achieving super-human performance in recognizing human speech has been a goal
for several decades, as researchers have worked on increasingly challenging
tasks. In the 1990's it was discovered, that conversational speech between two
humans turns out to be considerably more difficult than read speech as
hesitations, disfluencies, false starts and sloppy articulation complicate
acoustic processing and require robust handling of acoustic, lexical and
language context, jointly. Early attempts with statistical models could only
reach error rates over 50% and far from human performance (WER of around 5.5%).
Neural hybrid models and recent attention-based encoder-decoder models have
considerably improved performance as such contexts can now be learned in an
integral fashion. However, processing such contexts requires an entire
utterance presentation and thus introduces unwanted delays before a recognition
result can be output. In this paper, we address performance as well as latency.
We present results for a system that can achieve super-human performance (at a
WER of 5.0%, over the Switchboard conversational benchmark) at a word based
latency of only 1 second behind a speaker's speech. The system uses multiple
attention-based encoder-decoder networks integrated within a novel low latency
incremental inference approach.

three spectral slopes between 400 and 950 nm. We have made these maps available

formations of endogenous origin, which appear bluer than the rest of the

products and buyers. Despite their ubiquity, they face two important
challenges. First, they are data-intensive, a feature that precludes
sophisticated recommendations by some types of sellers, including those selling
durable goods. Second, they often focus on estimating fixed evaluations of
products by consumers while ignoring state-dependent behaviors identified in
the Marketing literature.
  We propose a recommendation system based on consumer browsing behaviors,
which bypasses the ""cold start"" problem described above, and takes into account
the fact that consumers act as ""moving targets,"" behaving differently depending
on the recommendations suggested to them along their search journey. First, we
recover the consumers' search policy function via machine learning methods.
Second, we include that policy into the recommendation system's dynamic problem
via a Bellman equation framework.
  When compared with the seller's own recommendations, our system produces a
profit increase of 33%. Our counterfactual analyses indicate that browsing
history along with past recommendations feature strong complementary effects in
value creation. Moreover, managing customer churn effectively is a big part of
value creation, whereas recommending alternatives in a forward-looking way
produces moderate effects.

PopNTs of different chiralities ($(n,0)$ and $(0,n)$) and/or diameters and at
different temperatures (from 300 up to 1200K). Results showed that the tubes
are thermally stable (at least up to 1200K). All tubes presented stress/strain
curves with a quasi-linear behavior followed by an abrupt drop of stress
values. Interestingly, armchair-like PopNTs ($(0,n)$) can stand a higher strain
load before fracturing when contrasted to the zigzag-like ones ($(n,0)$).
Moreover, it was obtained that the Young's modulus ($Y_{Mod}$) (750-900 GPa)

ones reported for conventional armchair and zigzag carbon nanotubes. $Y_{Mod}$

a generalized linear model. We focus on estimators based on approximate message
passing (AMP), a family of iterative algorithms with many appealing features:
the performance of AMP in the high-dimensional limit can be succinctly
characterized under suitable model assumptions; AMP can also be tailored to the
empirical distribution of the signal entries, and for a wide class of
estimation problems, AMP is conjectured to be optimal among all polynomial-time
algorithms.
  However, a major issue of AMP is that in many models (such as phase
retrieval), it requires an initialization correlated with the ground-truth
signal and independent from the measurement matrix. Assuming that such an
initialization is available is typically not realistic. In this paper, we solve
this problem by proposing an AMP algorithm initialized with a spectral
estimator. With such an initialization, the standard AMP analysis fails since
the spectral estimator depends in a complicated way on the design matrix. Our
main contribution is a rigorous characterization of the performance of AMP with
spectral initialization in the high-dimensional limit. The key technical idea
is to define and analyze a two-phase artificial AMP algorithm that first
produces the spectral estimator, and then closely approximates the iterates of
the true AMP. We also provide numerical results that demonstrate the validity
of the proposed approach.

striking example comes from large-scale structures, generally assumed to
originate from vacuum quantum fluctuations and stretched by an expansion phase.
Inflation is the leading paradigm in explaining this process. The various
observational successes of inflationary models drive the scientific community
into elaborating more and more stringent tests, which can simultaneously be
used to probe beyond the simple slow-roll, single field inflation. However,
inflation is not a theory, and going beyond inflation is a necessity. Various
alternatives and/or complementary mechanisms to inflation have been invoked in
the literature. The best-known cosmological models endowed with the capacity of
explaining large-scale observations while avoiding the singularity form a class
called non-singular bouncing models. The main features of these models are the
presence of a contraction phase before expansion, and a never-vanishing scale
factor. A non-singular bounce generally appears when quantum effects are part
of the model, playing the role of a regulator leading to the avoidance of
singularities. This thesis focuses on a Hamiltonian formulation of quantum
effects in cosmology. We first explore stochastic perturbations in a collapsing
universe. Then, we show that quantum cosmology with Bohmian mechanics resolves
the initial singularity. Adding a non-minimal coupling of gravity with
electromagnetism, we show that the generation of magnetic fields is possible.
Finally, we apply the affine quantisation on the Brans-Dicke Theory, the
prototype of modified gravity theories, and we discuss the quantum equivalence
of the Jordan and Einstein frames within this framework. We show that in both
frames a smooth bounce is expected, and that equivalence between frames holds

refers to the set of documents that match the client's queries. This provides
protection against current attacks that largely depend on this leakage to
succeed. However, most SSE constructions also leak whether or not two queries
aim for the same keyword, also called the search pattern.
  In this work, we show that search pattern leakage can severely undermine
current SSE defenses. We propose an attack that leverages both access and
search pattern leakage, as well as some background and query distribution
information, to recover the keywords of the queries performed by the client.
Our attack follows a maximum likelihood estimation approach, and is easy to
adapt against SSE defenses that obfuscate the access pattern. We empirically
show that our attack is efficient, it outperforms other proposed attacks, and
it completely thwarts two out of the three defenses we evaluate it against,
even when these defenses are set to high privacy regimes. These findings
highlight that hiding the search pattern, a feature that most constructions are
lacking, is key towards providing practical privacy guarantees in SSE.

jointly with the downstream prediction task and the translation is guided by
the prediction. Experiments on two applications demonstrate the effectiveness

reconstruction techniques do not apply to or are difficult to interpret for
non-linear image reconstruction. The vast majority of metrics employed for
evaluating non-linear image reconstruction are based on some form of global
image fidelity, such as image root mean square error (RMSE). Use of such
metrics can lead to over-regularization in the sense that they can favor
removal of subtle details in the image. To address this shortcoming, we develop
an image quality metric based on signal detection that serves as a surrogate to
the qualitative loss of fine image details. Methods: The metric is demonstrated
in the context of a breast CT simulation, where different equal-dose
configurations are considered. The configurations differ in the number of
projections acquired. Image reconstruction is performed with a non-linear
algorithm based on total variation constrained least-squares (TV-LSQ). The
images are evaluated visually, with image RMSE, and with the proposed
signal-detection based metric. The latter uses a small signal, and computes
detectability in the sinogram and in the reconstructed image. Loss of signal
detectability through the image reconstruction process is taken as a
quantitative measure of loss of fine details in the image. Results: Loss of
signal detectability is seen to correlate well with the blocky or patchy
appearance due to over-regularization with TV-LSQ, and this trend runs counter
to the image RMSE metric, which tends to favor the over-regularized images.
Conclusions: The proposed signal detection based metric provides an image
quality assessment that is complimentary to that of image RMSE. Using the two
metrics in concert may yield a useful prescription for determining CT algorithm
and configuration parameters when non-linear image reconstruction is used.

be about 25 times more sensitive than the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, while in the
hard band (2.3--8\,keV) it will provide the first ever true imaging survey of
the sky. The eROSITA design driving science is the detection of large samples
of galaxy clusters up to redshifts $z>1$ in order to study the large-scale
structure of the universe and test cosmological models including Dark Energy.
In addition, eROSITA is expected to yield a sample of a few million AGNs,
including obscured objects, revolutionizing our view of the evolution of
supermassive black holes. The survey will also provide new insights into a wide

some code fragments such as memory allocation are more vulnerable than others,
various improving techniques have been proposed to explore the more vulnerable
areas by collecting extra information from the program under test or its

information sources and ignore the fact that the priority a seed input to be
fuzzed may be influenced by all the code it covers. Based on the above
observations, we propose a fuzzing method based on the importance of functions.
First, a data structure called Attributed Interprocedural Control Flow Graph

importance of each node in the AICFG is calculated based on an improved
PageRank algorithm, which also models the influence between connected nodes.
During the fuzzing process, the node importance is updated periodically by a

exact inchworm quantum Monte-Carlo data to assess their validity. As a
demonstration of its power, the NCA method is employed to study the impact of
correlations on higher order cumulants in the nonequilibrium Anderson impurity

that correlation effects have a profound influence on the underlying transport
distributions. Higher order cumulants are therefore demonstrated to be a proxy
for the presence of Kondo correlations in a way that cannot be captured by

with advection. During accretion onto magnetised NS, super-Eddington luminosity
$L_\mathrm{X}>10^{38}$ erg~s$^{-1}$ is attained already at the subcritical
stage, when the energy release at the inner boundary of the disc defined by the
NS magnetosphere is sub-Eddington. It is shown that standard evolution of CBS
with an account of the peculiarities specific for accretion onto magnetised NS
allows us to explain quantitatively observed characteristics of NULX (X-ray
luminosities, NS spin periods, orbital periods and masses of visual components)
without additional model assumptions on the collimation of X-ray emission from
NS with high observed super-Eddington luminosity. In a model galaxy with star

Discovery of a powerful wind from NULX with $L_{\mathrm X} \sim 10^{41}$

two-stroke cycles where two collections of identical quantum systems with
evenly spaced energy levels are initially prepared at thermal equilibrium by
putting them in contact with a cold and a hot thermal bath, respectively. The
two cycles differ in the absence or the presence of a mediator system, while,
in both cases, non-resonant exchange Hamiltonians are exploited as particle
interactions. We show that the efficiencies of these machines depend only on
the energy gaps of the systems composing the collections and are equal to the
efficiency of ""equivalent"" Otto cycles. Focusing on the cases of qubits or
harmonic oscillators for both models, we maximize the engine power and analyze,
in the model without the mediator, the role of the waiting time between
subsequent interactions. It turns out that the case with the mediator can bring
performance advantages when the interaction times are comparable with the
waiting time of the correspondent cycle without the mediator. We find that in
both cycles, the power peaks of qubit systems can surpass the Curzon-Ahlborn
efficiency. Finally, we compare our cycle without the mediator with previous
schemes of the quantum Otto cycle showing that high coupling is not required to
achieve the same maximum power.

primarily by Ni-vacancy acceptors. Herein, we present a systematic study
comparing the optoelectronic properties of stoichiometric NiO, oxygen-rich NiO
with Ni vacancies (NiO:VNi), and Ni-rich NiO with O vacancies (NiO:VO). The
optical properties were obtained by spectroscopic ellipsometry, while valence
band spectra were probed by high-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
The experimental results are directly compared to first-principles density
functional theory + U calculations. Computational results confirm that gap
states are present in both NiO systems with vacancies. Gap states in NiO:Vo are
predominantly Ni 3d states, while those in NiO:VNi are composed of both Ni 3d
and O 2p states. The absorption spectra of the NiO:VNi sample show significant
defect-induced features below 3.0 eV compared to NiO and NiO:VO samples. The
increase in sub-gap absorptions in NiO:VNi can be attributed to gap states
observed in the electronic density of states. The relation between native
vacancy defects and electronic and optical properties of NiO are demonstrated,
showing that at similar vacancy concentration, the optical constants of NiO:VNi
deviate significantly from those of NiO:VO. Our experimental and computational
results reveal that although VNi are effective acceptors in NiO, they also
degrade the visible transparency of the material. Hence, for transparent
optoelectronic device applications, an optimization of native VNi defects with
extrinsic doping is required to simultaneously enhance p-type conductivity and
transparency.

medical imaging modalities, they are profoundly multi-modal and are capable of
visualising a variety of combinations of conditions. There is an ever pressing
need for greater quantities of labelled data to develop new diagnostic tools,
however this is in direct opposition to concerns regarding patient
confidentiality which constrains access through permission requests and ethics
approvals. Previous work has sought to address these concerns by creating
class-specific GANs that synthesise images to augment training data. These
approaches cannot be scaled as they introduce computational trade offs between
model size and class number which places fixed limits on the quality that such
generates can achieve. We address this concern by introducing latent class
optimisation which enables efficient, multi-modal sampling from a GAN and with
which we synthesise a large archive of labelled generates. We apply a PGGAN to
the task of unsupervised x-ray synthesis and have radiologists evaluate the
clinical realism of the resultant samples. We provide an in depth review of the
properties of varying pathologies seen on generates as well as an overview of
the extent of disease diversity captured by the model. We validate the
application of the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) to measure the quality of
x-ray generates and find that they are similar to other high resolution tasks.
We quantify x-ray clinical realism by asking radiologists to distinguish
between real and fake scans and find that generates are more likely to be
classed as real than by chance, but there is still progress required to achieve
true realism. We confirm these findings by evaluating synthetic classification
model performance on real scans. We conclude by discussing the limitations of
PGGAN generates and how to achieve controllable, realistic generates.

not always hold in real-world applications where the training and the test data
fall from different distributions, due to many factors, e.g., collecting the

discrepancy across domain distributions, and naively applying the trained model

is a sub-field within machine learning that aims to cope with these types of

rotation curves into contributions from the baryonic components and the dark
halo of a galaxy. One direct observational method to determine the disc M/L is
by calculating the surface mass density of the disc from the stellar vertical
velocity dispersion and the scale height of the disc. Usually, the scale height
is obtained from near-IR studies of edge-on galaxies and pertains to the older,
kinematically hotter stars in the disc, while the vertical velocity dispersion
of stars is measured in the optical band and refers to stars of all ages (up to
~10 Gyr) and velocity dispersions. This mismatch between the scale height and
the velocity dispersion can lead to underestimates of the disc surface density
and a misleading conclusion of the sub-maximality of galaxy discs. In this
paper we present the study of the stellar velocity dispersion of the disc
galaxy NGC 6946 using integrated star light and individual planetary nebulae as
dynamical tracers. We demonstrate the presence of two kinematically distinct
populations of tracers which contribute to the total stellar velocity
dispersion. Thus, we are able to use the dispersion and the scale height of the
same dynamical population to derive the surface mass density of the disc over a
radial extent. We find the disc of NGC 6946 to be closer to maximal with the
baryonic component contributing most of the radial gravitational field in the
inner parts of the galaxy (Vmax(bar) = 0.76($\pm$0.14)Vmax).

hydrogen is present abundantly in the nuclear or central sub-kiloparsec regions

molecular hydrogen along the bar, which might mean that the gas is still being

formation is also present along the bar co-rotation radius of this galaxy. The

homogeneous linear recurrence relation with positive coefficients and a

\emph{complete} if every positive integer is a sum of distinct terms of the
sequence. One consequence of Zeckendorf's theorem is that the sequence of
Fibonacci numbers is complete. Previous work has established a generalized
Zeckendorf's theorem for all PLRS's. We consider PLRS's and want to classify
them as complete or not. We study how completeness is affected by modifying the

With nationwide lockdowns and stay-at-home advisories, conversations about the
pandemic have naturally moved to social networks, e.g. Twitter. This affords an
unprecedented insight into the evolution of social discourse in the presence of
a long-running destabilizing factor such as a pandemic with the high-volume,
high-velocity, high-noise Covid-19 Twitter feed. However, real-time information
extraction from such a data stream requires a fault-tolerant streaming
infrastructure to perform the non-trivial integration of heterogenous data
sources from news organizations, social feeds, and authoritative medical
organizations like the CDC. To address this, we present (i) the EDNA streaming
toolkit for consuming and processing streaming data, and (ii) EDNA-Covid, a
multilingual, large-scale dataset of coronavirus-related tweets collected with
EDNA since January 25, 2020. EDNA-Covid includes, at time of this publication,
over 600M tweets from around the world in over 10 languages. We release both
the EDNA toolkit and the EDNA-Covid dataset to the public so that they can be
used to extract valuable insights on this extraordinary social event.

particular of motifs in the GRN, the triangles, which are imbalanced if the

Our result demonstrates that due to genes' collective behavior the complex

interactions between elements, disruption of which inevitably results in
dysfunction. Likewise, the brain networks' complexity arises from interactions
beyond pair connections, as it is simplistic to assume that in complex networks
state of a link is independently determined only according to its two
constituting nodes. This is particularly of note in genetically complex brain
impairments, such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which has a surprising
heterogeneity in manifestations with no clear-cut neuropathology. Accordingly,
structural balance theory (SBT) affirms that in real-world signed networks, a
link is remarkably influenced by each of its two nodes' interactions with the
third node within a triadic interrelationship. Thus, it is plausible to ask
whether ASD is associated with altered structural balance resulting from
atypical triadic interactions. In other words, it is the abnormal interplay of
positive and negative interactions that matters in ASD, besides and beyond hypo
(hyper) pair connectivity. To address this question, we explore triadic
interactions based on SBT in the weighted signed resting-state functional
magnetic resonance imaging networks of participants with ASD relative to
healthy controls (CON). We demonstrate that balanced triads are overrepresented
in the ASD and CON networks while unbalanced triads are underrepresented,
providing first-time empirical evidence for the strong notion of structural
balance on the brain networks. We further analyze the frequency and energy
distributions of different triads and suggest an alternative description for
the reduced functional integration and segregation in the ASD brain networks.
Moreover, results reveal that the scale of change in the whole-brain networks'
energy is more narrow in the ASD networks during development.

  of Latency in Robotic Telesurgery","6 pages with 5 figures and 1 table. J Robotic Surg (2020)",,"10.1007/s11701-020-01149-5",,"cs.CV cs.AI cs.RO eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The introduction of surgical robots brought about advancements in surgical
procedures. The applications of remote telesurgery range from building medical
clinics in underprivileged areas, to placing robots abroad in military
hot-spots where accessibility and diversity of medical experience may be
limited. Poor wireless connectivity may result in a prolonged delay, referred
to as latency, between a surgeon's input and action a robot takes. In surgery,
any micro-delay can injure a patient severely and in some cases, result in
fatality. One was to increase safety is to mitigate the effects of latency
using deep learning aided computer vision. While the current surgical robots
use calibrated sensors to measure the position of the arms and tools, in this
work we present a purely optical approach that provides a measurement of the
tool position in relation to the patient's tissues. This research aimed to
produce a neural network that allowed a robot to detect its own mechanical
manipulator arms. A conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) was
trained on 1107 frames of mock gastrointestinal robotic surgery data from the
2015 EndoVis Instrument Challenge and corresponding hand-drawn labels for each
frame. When run on new testing data, the network generated near-perfect labels
of the input images which were visually consistent with the hand-drawn labels
and was able to do this in 299 milliseconds. These accurately generated labels
can then be used as simplified identifiers for the robot to track its own
controlled tools. These results show potential for conditional GANs as a
reaction mechanism such that the robot can detect when its arms move outside
the operating area within a patient. This system allows for more accurate
monitoring of the position of surgical instruments in relation to the patient's
tissue, increasing safety measures that are integral to successful telesurgery
systems.

  and memory algorithm for brain-like intelligence",,,,,"cs.NE cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The algorithm of brain learning and memory is still undetermined. The
backpropagation algorithm of artificial neural networks was thought not
suitable for brain cortex, and there is a lack of algorithm for memory engram.
We designed a brain version of backpropagation algorithm, which are
biologically plausible and could be implemented with virtual neurons to
complete image classification task. An encoding algorithm that can
automatically allocate engram cells is proposed, which is an algorithm
implementation for memory engram theory, and could simulate how hippocampus
achieve fast associative memory. The role of the LTP and LTD in the cerebellum
is also explained in algorithm level. Our results proposed a method for the
brain to deploy backpropagation algorithm, and sparse coding method for memory
engram theory.

""connected"" and finally as ""Acyclic"" by Mr. Randall Holmes. Acyclic
comprehension simply asserts that for any acyclic formula phi, the set {x:phi}
exists. I first presented this criterion semi-formally to Mr. Randall Holmes,
who further made the first rigorous definition of it, a definition that I
finally simplified to the one presented here. Later Mr. Holmes made another
presentation of the definition which is also mentioned here. He pointed to me
that acyclic comprehension is implied by stratification, and posed the question
as to whether it is equivalent to full stratification or strictly weaker. He
and initially I myself thought that it was strictly weaker; Mr. Randall Holmes
actually conjectured that it is very weak. Surprisingly it turned to be
equivalent to full stratification as I proved here
