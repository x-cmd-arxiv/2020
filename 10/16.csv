Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at their edges or vortex cores, while whether the
Majorana braiding in such systems is non-Abelian in general remains an open
question. Here we uncover in theory the unitary symmetry-protected non-Abelian
statisitcs of MZMs and propose the experimental realization. We show that
braiding two vortices with each hosting $N$ unitary symmetry-protected MZMs
generically reduces to $N$ independent sectors, with each sector braiding two
different Majorana modes. This renders the unitary symmetry-protected
non-Abelian statistics. As a concrete example, we demonstrate the proposed
non-Abelian statistics in a spin-triplet TSC which hosts two MZMs at each
vortex and, interestingly, can be precisely mapped to a quantum anomalous Hall
insulator. Thus the unitary symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics can be
verified in the latter insulating phase, with the application to realizing
various topological quantum gates being studied. Finally, we propose a novel
experimental scheme to realize the present study in an optical Raman lattice.
Our work opens a new route for Majorana-based topological quantum computation.

unprecedented scale. We intend to investigate hoarding behaviors in response to
the pandemic using large-scale social media data. First, we collect
hoarding-related tweets shortly after the outbreak of the coronavirus. Next, we
analyze the hoarding and anti-hoarding patterns of over 42,000 unique Twitter
users in the United States from March 1 to April 30, 2020, and dissect the
hoarding-related tweets by age, gender, and geographic location. We find the
percentage of females in both hoarding and anti-hoarding groups is higher than
that of the general Twitter user population. Furthermore, using topic modeling,
we investigate the opinions expressed towards the hoarding behavior by
categorizing these topics according to demographic and geographic groups. We
also calculate the anxiety scores for the hoarding and anti-hoarding related
tweets using a lexical approach. By comparing their anxiety scores with the
baseline Twitter anxiety score, we reveal further insights. The LIWC anxiety
mean for the hoarding-related tweets is significantly higher than the baseline
Twitter anxiety mean. Interestingly, beer has the highest calculated anxiety
score compared to other hoarded items mentioned in the tweets.

remarkable performance on multiple computer vision tasks, researches on
adversarial learning have shown that deep models are vulnerable to adversarial
examples, which are crafted by adding visually imperceptible perturbations to
the input images. Most of the existing adversarial attack methods only create a
single adversarial example for the input, which just gives a glimpse of the
underlying data manifold of adversarial examples. An attractive solution is to
explore the solution space of the adversarial examples and generate a diverse
bunch of them, which could potentially improve the robustness of real-world
systems and help prevent severe security threats and vulnerabilities. In this
paper, we present an effective method, called Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with
Accumulated Momentum (HMCAM), aiming to generate a sequence of adversarial
examples. To improve the efficiency of HMC, we propose a new regime to
automatically control the length of trajectories, which allows the algorithm to
move with adaptive step sizes along the search direction at different
positions. Moreover, we revisit the reason for high computational cost of
adversarial training under the view of MCMC and design a new generative method
called Contrastive Adversarial Training (CAT), which approaches equilibrium
distribution of adversarial examples with only few iterations by building from
small modifications of the standard Contrastive Divergence (CD) and achieve a
trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Both quantitative and qualitative
analysis on several natural image datasets and practical systems have confirmed
the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

dynamically. In particular, we study an elastic arch subject to an
end-shortening that evolves linearly with time, i.e. at a constant rate. For
large end-shortening the arch is bistable but, below a critical end-shortening,
the arch becomes monostable. We study when and how the arch transitions between
states and show that the end-shortening at which the fast 'snap' happens
depends on the rate at which the end-shortening is reduced. This lag in
snap-through is a consequence of delayed bifurcation and occurs even in the
perfectly elastic case when viscous (and viscoelastic) effects are negligible.
We present the results of numerical simulations to determine the magnitude of
this lag as the loading rate and the importance of external viscous damping
vary. We also present an asymptotic analysis of the geometrically-nonlinear
problem that reduces the salient dynamics to that of an ordinary differential
equation; the form of this reduced equation is generic for snap-through
instabilities in which the relevant control parameter is ramped linearly in
time. Moreover, this asymptotic reduction allows us to derive analytical
results for the observed lag in snap-through that are in good agreement with
the numerical results of our simulations. Finally, we discuss scaling laws for
the lag that should be expected in other examples of delayed bifurcation in
elastic instabilities.

000 quiescent galaxies at $z<0.3$ to investigate the connection between
radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGNs) and the morphology of their host

RLAGNs with $L_{\rm 150\,MHz}>10^{21}\rm\,W\,Hz^{-1}$ at fixed stellar mass,
velocity dispersion, or surface mass density does not depend on the galaxy
projected axis ratio ($q$). However, the high-power ($L_{\rm

massive, round galaxies, while the low- and intermediate-power ($L_{\rm

to non-RLAGN galaxies. We argue that our results support the picture that
high-power RLAGNs are more easily triggered in galaxies with a merger-rich
history, while low-power RLAGNs can be triggered in galaxies growing mainly via
secular processes. Our work also supports the idea that the low-luminosity
RLAGN may be sufficient for maintenance-mode feedback in low-mass quiescent
galaxies with disc-like morphology, which is based on a simple extrapolation
from the observed energy balance between cooling and RLAGN-induced cavities in
massive clusters. We find no significant difference between the $q$
distributions of RLAGNs likely to be found in clusters and those likely not
found in clusters after controlling the radio luminosity and stellar mass of
the two samples, indicating that the environment does not significantly
influence the morphology--RLAGN correlation.

considered as a photon-photon collider. Indeed, in proton-proton, proton-ion,

very peripheral collisions, the incoming protons or ions remain almost intact
and continue their path along the beam axis. Then, only the electromagnetic
(EM) fields of these ultra-relativistic charged particles (protons or ions)
interact to leave a signature in the central detectors of the LHC experiments.
The interest is that the photon-photon interactions happen at unprecedented
energies (a few TeV per nucleon pairs) where the quantum electrodynamics (QED)
theory can be tested in extreme conditions and unforeseen laws of nature could
be discovered. In this report, we propose a focus on a particular reaction,
called light-by-light scattering in which two incoming photons interact,
producing another pair of photons. We describe how experimental results have
been obtained at the LHC. In addition, we discuss prospects for on-shell
photon-photon interactions in dedicated laser beam facilities. Potential
signatures of new physics might manifest as resonant deviations in the
refractive index, induced by anomalous light-by-light scattering effects.
Importantly, we explain how this process can be used to probe the physics
beyond the standard model such as theories that include large extra dimensions.

the lower level optimizes the variational posterior to fit the true posterior.
To solve BiSM efficiently, we develop a stochastic optimization algorithm with

convergence of the stochastic algorithm. Empirically, we show the promise of
BiSM in Gaussian restricted Boltzmann machines and highly nonstructural EBLVMs

widely adopted contrastive divergence and SM methods when they are applicable;
and can learn complex EBLVMs with intractable posteriors to generate natural

describing numerous physical processes that are based on some input fields in
spatial configurations. Understanding the physical process, in general,
requires computational modeling of the PDE. Uncertainty in the computational
model manifests through lack of precise knowledge of the input field or
configuration. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) in the output physical process
is typically carried out by modeling the uncertainty using a random field,
governed by an appropriate covariance function. This leads to solving
high-dimensional stochastic counterparts of the PDE computational models. Such
UQ-PDE models require a large number of simulations of the PDE in conjunction
with samples in the high-dimensional probability space, with probability
distribution associated with the covariance function. Those UQ computational
models having explicit knowledge of the covariance function are known as
aleatoric UQ (AUQ) models. The lack of such explicit knowledge leads to
epistemic UQ (EUQ) models, which typically require solution of a large number
of AUQ models. In this article, using a surrogate, post-processing, and domain
decomposition framework with coarse stochastic solution adaptation, we develop
an offline/online algorithm for efficiently simulating a class of EUQ-PDE

conformally coupled to a function of a scalar field and its kinetic term and
there is also a k-essence term consisting of the scalar and its kinetic term.
This action has three frames that are equivalent to one another: the original
Jordan frame, the Einstein frame where the metric is redefined, and the Riemann
frame where the connection is redefined. For the first time in the literature,
we calculate the quadratic action and the sound speed of scalar and tensor
perturbations in three different frames and show explicitly that they coincide.
Furthermore, we show that for such action the sound speed of gravitational
waves is unity. Thus, this model serves as dark energy as well as an inflaton
even though the presence of the dependence of the kinetic term of a scalar
field in the non-minimal coupling, different from the case in metric formalism.
We then proceed to construct the L3 action called Galileon terms in Palatini
formalism and compute its perturbations. We found that there are essentially 10
different(inequivalent) definitions in Palatini formalism for a given Galileon
term in metric formalism. We also see that,in general, the L3 terms have a
ghost due to Ostrogradsky instability and the sound speed of gravitational
waves could potentially deviate from unity, in sharp contrast with the case of
metric formalism. Interestingly, once we eliminate such a ghost, the sound
speed of gravitational waves also becomes unity. Thus, the ghost-free L3 terms
in Palatini formalism can still serve as dark energy as well as an inflaton,

closed path, is a fundamental observable in classical and quantum flows. It is
indeed a Lagrangian invariant in inviscid classical fluids. In quantum flows,
circulation is quantized, taking discrete values that are directly related to
the number and the orientation of thin vortex filaments enclosed by the path.
By varying the size of such closed loop, the circulation provides a measure of
the dependence of the flow structure on the considered scale. Here we consider
the scale dependence of circulation statistics in quantum turbulence, using
high resolution direct numerical simulations of a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
model. Results are compared to the circulation statistics obtained from
simulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. When the integration
path is smaller than the mean inter-vortex distance, the statistics of
circulation in quantum turbulence displays extreme intermittent behavior due to
the quantization of circulation, in stark contrast with the viscous scales of
classical flows. In contrast, at larger scales, circulation moments display
striking similarities with the statistics probed in the inertial range of
classical turbulence. This includes the emergence of the power law scalings
predicted from Kolmogorov's 1941 theory, as well as intermittency deviations
that closely follow the recently proposed bifractal model for circulation
moments in classical flows. To date, this is the most convincing evidence of
intermittency in the large scales of quantum turbulence. Moreover, our results
strongly reinforce the resemblance between classical and quantum turbulence,
highlighting the universality of inertial range dynamics, including
intermittency, across these two a priori very different systems.

coupled phase models. These phase models are helpful to analyze the
synchronization phenomena. For example, a phase model of two oscillators has a
one-dimensional differential equation for the evolution of the phase
difference. The existence of fixed points determines frequency-locking
solutions. By treating each oscillator as a black-box possessing a single input
and a single output, one can investigate various control algorithms to change
the synchronization of the oscillators. In particular, we are interested in a
delayed feedback control algorithm. Application of this algorithm to the
oscillators after a subsequent phase reduction should give the same phase model
as in the control-free case, but with a rescaled coupling strength. The
conventional delayed feedback control is limited to the change of magnitude but
does not allow the change of sign of the coupling strength. In this work, we
present a modification of the delayed feedback algorithm supplemented by an
additional unstable degree of freedom, which is able to change the sign of the
coupling strength. Various numerical calculations performed with Landau-Stuart
and FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators show successful switching between an in-phase
and anti-phase synchronization using the provided control algorithm.
Additionally, we show that the control force becomes non-invasive if our
objective is stabilization of an unstable phase difference for two coupled
oscillators.

also give the agent an incentive to interfere with events in the environment

to filter out future tasks that are not achievable by default. We formally
define interference incentives and show that the future task approach with a

both blackbox and whitebox ways by studying on the entropy, or uncertainty, of
the model's token-level predictions. For two strong pre-trained models, PEGASUS
and BART on two summarization datasets, we find a strong correlation between
low prediction entropy and where the model copies tokens rather than generating
novel text. The decoder's uncertainty also connects to factors like sentence
position and syntactic distance between adjacent pairs of tokens, giving a
sense of what factors make a context particularly selective for the model's
next output token. Finally, we study the relationship of decoder uncertainty
and attention behavior to understand how attention gives rise to these observed
effects in the model. We show that uncertainty is a useful perspective for
analyzing summarization and text generation models more broadly.

used to search for small molecules that can inhibit critical proteins involved
in the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle. An important target is the SARS-CoV-2 main
protease Mpro, an enzyme that cleaves the viral polyproteins into individual
proteins required for viral replication and transcription. Unfortunately,
standard computational screening methods face difficulties in ranking diverse
ligands to a receptor due to disparate ligand scaffolds and varying charge
states. Here, we describe full density functional quantum mechanical (DFT/QM)
simulations of Mpro in complex with various ligands to obtain absolute ligand
binding energies. Our calculations are enabled by a new cloud-native parallel
DFT/QM implementation running on computational resources from Amazon Web
Services (AWS). The results we obtain are promising: the approach is quite
capable of scoring a very diverse set of existing drug compounds for their
affinities to Mpro and suggest the DFT/QM approach is potentially more broadly
applicable to repurpose screening against this target. In addition, each DFT/QM
simulation required only ~1 hour (wall clock time) per ligand. The fast
turnaround time raises the practical possibility of a broad application of
large-scale quantum mechanics in the drug discovery pipeline at stages where
ligand diversity is essential.

syntactic rules to determine what spans of possible summary sentences can be
deleted, then learn a model of what to actually delete by optimizing for

syntactic constraints on candidate spans and instead leave compression
decisions to two data-driven criteria: plausibility and salience. Deleting a
span is plausible if removing it maintains the grammaticality and factuality of
a sentence, and spans are salient if they contain important information from
the summary. Each of these is judged by a pre-trained Transformer model, and
only deletions that are both plausible and not salient can be applied. When
integrated into a simple extraction-compression pipeline, our method achieves
strong in-domain results on benchmark summarization datasets, and human
evaluation shows that the plausibility model generally selects for grammatical
and factual deletions. Furthermore, the flexibility of our approach allows it
to generalize cross-domain: our system fine-tuned on only 500 samples from a

the emergence of scale-free dynamics in many complex systems, and possibly in

many different types of neural recordings, the biological principles behind
their emergence remained unknown. Utilizing different network models and
motivated by experimental observations, synaptic plasticity was proposed as a
possible mechanism to self-organize brain dynamics towards a critical point. In
this review, we discuss how various biologically plausible plasticity rules
operating across multiple timescales are implemented in the models and how they
alter the network's dynamical state through modification of number and strength
of the connections between the neurons. Some of these rules help to stabilize
criticality, some need additional mechanisms to prevent divergence from the
critical state. We propose that rules that are capable of bringing the network
to criticality can be classified by how long the near-critical dynamics
persists after their disabling. Finally, we discuss the role of
self-organization and criticality in computation. Overall, the concept of
criticality helps to shed light on brain function and self-organization, yet
the overall dynamics of living neural networks seem to harnesses not only
criticality for computation, but also deviations thereof.

backpropagation, which is generally regarded as biologically implausible. An

REINFORCE, a local learning rule modulated by a global signal that is more
consistent with biologically observed forms of synaptic plasticity. Although
this learning rule follows the gradient of return in expectation, it suffers
from high variance and thus the low speed of learning, rendering it impractical
to train deep networks. We therefore propose a novel algorithm called MAP
propagation to reduce this variance significantly while retaining the local
property of the learning rule. Experiments demonstrated that MAP propagation
could solve common reinforcement learning tasks at a similar speed to
backpropagation when applied to an actor-critic network. Our work thus allows
for the broader application of the teams of agents in deep reinforcement

spin Hall conductivities vanish. However, since the valley Hall effect (VHE) in
these systems also generates a transverse flow of orbital angular momentum it
becomes experimentally challenging to distinguish between the two effects in
these materials. The VHE requires inversion symmetry breaking to occur, which
takes place in the TMD monolayers, but not in the bilayers. We show that a
bilayer of 2H-MoS$_2$ is an orbital Hall insulator that exhibits a sizeable OHE

characterised by an orbital Chern number that assumes the value
$\mathcal{C}_{L}=2$ for the 2H-MoS$_2$ bilayer and $\mathcal{C}_{L}=1$ for the

use of intermediary images or volumes have been shown to aide registration in
such cases.
  To account for this phenomena within our own longitudinal aging cohort, we
generated a population specific MRI and PET template from a broad distribution
of 30 amyloid negative subjects. We then registered the PET image of each of
these subjects, as well as a holdout set of thirty 'template-naive' subjects to
their corresponding MRI images using the template image as an intermediate

evaluate the performance of both conventional registration and our method, we
compared these to the registration of the attenuation CT (acquired at time of
PET acquisition) to MRI as the reference. We then used our template to directly
derive SUVR values without the use of MRI.
  We found that conventional registration was comparable to an existing CT
based standard, and there was no significant difference in errors collectively

between existing and MR-less tau PET quantification methods. We conclude that a

inequalities yields a robust proof of the quantum Singleton bound for quantum
error-correcting codes (QECC). For entanglement-assisted quantum
error-correcting codes (EAQECC) and catalytic codes (CQECC), a type of
generalized quantum Singleton bound [Brun et al., IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory
60(6):3073--3089 (2014)] was believed to hold for many years until recently one
of us found a counterexample [MG, Phys. Rev. A 103, 020601 (2021)]. Here, we
rectify this state of affairs by proving the correct generalized quantum
Singleton bound, extending the above-mentioned proof method for QECC; we also
prove information-theoretically tight bounds on the entanglement-communication
tradeoff for EAQECC. All of the bounds relate block length $n$ and code length
$k$ for given minimum distance $d$ and we show that they are robust, in the
sense that they hold with small perturbations for codes which only correct most
of the erasure errors of less than $d$ letters. In contrast to the classical
case, the bounds take on qualitatively different forms depending on whether the
minimum distance is smaller or larger than half the block length. We also
provide a propagation rule: any pure QECC yields an EAQECC with the same
distance and dimension, but of shorter block length.

a novel randomized algorithm, Probabilistic Sequential Shrinking($u$)
(PSS($u$)), which is agnostic to the amount of corruptions. When the amount of
corruptions per step (CPS) is below a threshold, PSS($u$) identifies the best
arm or item with probability tending to $1$ as $T\rightarrow \infty$.
Otherwise, the optimality gap of the identified item degrades gracefully with
the CPS.We argue that such a bifurcation is necessary. In PSS($u$), the
parameter $u$ serves to balance between the optimality gap and success
probability. The injection of randomization is shown to be essential to
mitigate the impact of corruptions. To demonstrate this, we design two attack
strategies that are applicable to any algorithm. We apply one of them to a
deterministic analogue of PSS($u$) known as Successive Halving (SH) by Karnin
et al. (2013). The attack strategy results in a high failure probability for
SH, but PSS($u$) remains robust. In the absence of corruptions, PSS($2$)'s
performance guarantee matches SH's. We show that when the CPS is sufficiently

information between two parties by means of a shared resource state and local
operations and classical communication (LOCC). Here we develop two seemingly
different ways of quantifying the simulation error of unideal bidirectional
teleportation by means of the normalized diamond distance and the channel
infidelity, and we prove that they are equivalent. By relaxing the set of
operations allowed from LOCC to those that completely preserve the positivity
of the partial transpose, we obtain semi-definite programming lower bounds on
the simulation error of unideal bidirectional teleportation. We evaluate these
bounds for several key examples: when there is no resource state at all and for
isotropic and Werner states, in each case finding an analytical solution. The
first aforementioned example establishes a benchmark for classical versus
quantum bidirectional teleportation. Another example consists of a resource
state resulting from the action of a generalized amplitude damping channel on
two Bell states, for which we find an analytical expression for the simulation
error. We then evaluate the performance of some schemes for bidirectional
teleportation due to Kiktenko et al. and find that they are suboptimal and do
not go beyond the aforementioned classical limit. We offer a scheme alternative
to theirs that is provably optimal. Finally, we generalize the whole
development to the setting of bidirectional controlled teleportation, in which
there is an additional assisting party who helps with the exchange of quantum
information, and we establish semi-definite programming lower bounds on the
simulation error for this task. More generally, we provide semi-definite
programming lower bounds on the performance of bipartite and multipartite
channel simulation using a shared resource state and LOCC.

components of the force between fluid-immersed PDMS (polydimethylsiloxane)

these experiments: the passing of two spheres (SP), and the steady sliding
between two elongated samples that are arranged orthogonally with a fixed depth
of overlap (FD). We use glycerol-water mixture at different concentrations as
the interstitial fluid, with the sliding speeds varied over four decades. In
both SP and FD experiments, the time-averaged values of tangential force share
similar speed dependence that is consistent to the well-known Stribeck curve in
tribology. However, the normal force reflects a Hertzian scaling and appears
insensitive to the sliding speed. In addition, our experiments time-resolve the
fluctuations of tangential force which reveal stick-slip patterns, in order to
probe the possible mechanisms behind the reduction of ""friction"" from its

gain insights about a certain disease. In such cases, it is common to use
feature importance as a tool to highlight significant factors contributing to
that disease. As there are many existing methods for computing feature
importance scores, understanding their relative merits is not trivial. Further,
the diversity of scenarios in which they are used lead to different
expectations from the feature importance scores. While it is common to make the
distinction between local scores that focus on individual predictions and
global scores that look at the contribution of a feature to the model, another
important division distinguishes model scenarios, in which the goal is to
understand predictions of a given model from natural scenarios, in which the
goal is to understand a phenomenon such as a disease. We develop a set of
axioms that represent the properties expected from a feature importance
function in the natural scenario and prove that there exists only one function
that satisfies all of them, the Marginal Contribution Feature Importance (MCI).
We analyze this function for its theoretical and empirical properties and
compare it to other feature importance scores. While our focus is the natural
scenario, we suggest that our axiomatic approach could be carried out in other
scenarios too.

Such a model does not admit a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem typical of systems
realizing deconfined critical points. Nevertheless, we find evidence for a
direct transition from the VBS phase to a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ ferromagnet.

prediction with remarkable success. Many practical scenarios, however, require
predictions at more granular timescales. For instance, accurate prediction of
short but extreme flood peaks can make a life-saving difference, yet such peaks
may escape the coarse temporal resolution of daily predictions. Naively
training an LSTM on hourly data, however, entails very long input sequences
that make learning hard and computationally expensive. In this study, we
propose two Multi-Timescale LSTM (MTS-LSTM) architectures that jointly predict
multiple timescales within one model, as they process long-past inputs at a
single temporal resolution and branch out into each individual timescale for
more recent input steps. We test these models on 516 basins across the
continental United States and benchmark against the US National Water Model.
Compared to naive prediction with a distinct LSTM per timescale, the
multi-timescale architectures are computationally more efficient with no loss
in accuracy. Beyond prediction quality, the multi-timescale LSTM can process
different input variables at different timescales, which is especially relevant
to operational applications where the lead time of meteorological forcings
depends on their temporal resolution.

self-supervised representation learning using a causal framework. We show how
data augmentations can be more effectively utilized through explicit invariance
constraints on the proxy classifiers employed during pretraining. Based on
this, we propose a novel self-supervised objective, Representation Learning via
Invariant Causal Mechanisms (ReLIC), that enforces invariant prediction of
proxy targets across augmentations through an invariance regularizer which
yields improved generalization guarantees. Further, using causality we
generalize contrastive learning, a particular kind of self-supervised method,

  55 pages",,,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Secure two-party computation considers the problem of two parties computing a
joint function of their private inputs without revealing anything beyond the
output. In this work, we consider the setting where the two parties (a
classical Alice and a quantum Bob) can communicate only via a classical
channel. Our first result shows that it is in general impossible to realize a
two-party quantum functionality with black-box simulation in the case of
malicious quantum adversaries. In particular, we show that the existence of a
secure quantum computing protocol that relies only on classical channels would
contradict the quantum no-cloning argument.
  We circumvent this impossibility following three different approaches. The
first is by considering a weaker security notion called one-sided simulation
security. This notion protects the input of one party (the quantum Bob) in the
standard simulation-based sense and protects the privacy of the other party's
input (the classical Alice). We show how to realize a protocol that satisfies
this notion relying on the learning with errors assumption. The second way to
circumvent the impossibility result, while at the same time providing standard
simulation-based security also against a malicious Bob, is by assuming that the
quantum input has an efficient classical representation.
  Finally, we focus our attention on the class of zero-knowledge
functionalities and provide a compiler that takes as input a classical proof of
quantum knowledge (PoQK) protocol for a QMA relation R and outputs a
zero-knowledge PoQK for R that can be verified by classical parties. The direct
implication of our result is that Mahadev's protocol for classical verification
of quantum computations (FOCS'18) can be turned into a zero-knowledge proof of
quantum knowledge with classical verifiers. To the best of our knowledge, we
are the first to instantiate such a primitive.

scalar particles. A well-motivated example is from a pure Yang-Mills hidden
sector, which locks up into glueballs in the early universe. The lightest
glueball states are scalar particles and can act as a form of bosonic dark
matter. If self-interactions are repulsive this can potentially lead to very
massive boson stars, where the inward gravitational force is balanced by the
repulsive self-interaction. This can also arise from elementary real scalars
with a regular potential. In the literature it has been claimed that this
allows for astrophysically significant boson stars with high compactness, which
could undergo binary mergers and generate detectable gravitational waves. Here
we show that previous analyses did not take into proper account $3 \to 2$ and
$4 \to 2$ quantum mechanical annihilation processes in the core of the star,
while other work misinterpreted the classical $3 \to 1$ process. In this work,
we compute the annihilation rates, finding that massive stars will rapidly
decay from the $3 \to 2$ or $4 \to 2$ processes (while the $3 \to 1$ process is
typically small). Using the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations, we also estimate
the binding energy of these stars, showing that even the densest stars do not
have quite enough binding energy to prevent annihilations. For such boson stars
to live for the current age of the universe and to be consistent with bounds on
dark matter scattering in galaxies, we find the following upper bound on their
mass for $O(1)$ self-interaction couplings: $M_*<10^{-18}M_{sun}$ when $3 \to
2$ processes are allowed and $M_*<10^{-11}M_{sun}$ when only $4 \to 2$
processes are allowed. We also estimate destabilization from parametric
resonance which can considerably constrain the phase space further.
Furthermore, such stars are required to have very small compactness to be long
lived.

mathematically model cognitive biases and provide a general framework through

this result, we design a time allocation strategy for a resource-constrained

We, then, conduct a second user experiment which shows that our time allocation
strategy with explanation can effectively de-anchor the human and improve
collaborative performance when the AI model has low confidence and is

two-pion intermediate states, which are responsible for about $70\%$ of the HVP
contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^\text{HVP}$.
Lattice-QCD evaluations of the latter indicate that it might be larger than
calculated dispersively on the basis of $e^+e^-\to\text{hadrons}$ data, at a
level which would contest the long-standing discrepancy with the $a_\mu$
measurement. In this Letter we study to which extent this $2\pi$ contribution
can be modified without, at the same time, producing a conflict elsewhere in
low-energy hadron phenomenology. To this end we consider a dispersive
representation of the $e^+e^- \to 2\pi$ process and study the correlations
which thereby emerge between $a_\mu^\text{HVP}$, the hadronic running of the
fine-structure constant, the $P$-wave $\pi\pi$ phase shift, and the charge
radius of the pion. Inelastic effects play an important role, despite being
constrained by the Eidelman-Lukaszuk bound. We identify scenarios in which
$a_\mu^\text{HVP}$ can be altered substantially, driven by changes in the phase
shift and/or the inelastic contribution, and illustrate the ensuing changes in
the $e^+e^-\to 2\pi$ cross section. In the combined scenario, which minimizes
the effect in the cross section, a uniform shift around $4\%$ is required. At
the same time both the analytic continuation into the space-like region and the
pion charge radius are affected at a level that could be probed in future
lattice-QCD calculations.

phenomena that do not exist in any equilibrium states of matter, whose
classification and characterization require new theoretical ideas that are
beyond the well-established paradigm of static topological phases. In this
work, we provide a general framework to understand anomalous Floquet
higher-order topological insulators (AFHOTIs), the classification of which has
remained a challenging open question. In two dimensions (2D), such AFHOTIs are
defined by their robust, symmetry-protected corner modes pinned at special
quasienergies, even though all their Floquet bands feature trivial band
topology. The corner-mode physics of an AFHOTI is found to be generically
indicated by 3D Dirac/Weyl-like topological singularities living in the phase
spectrum of the bulk time-evolution operator. Physically, such a phase-band
singularity is essentially a ""footprint"" of the topological quantum
criticality, which separates an AFHOTI from a trivial phase adiabatically
connected to a static limit. Strikingly, these singularities feature
unconventional dispersion relations that cannot be achieved on any static
lattice in 3D, which, nevertheless, resemble the surface physics of 4D
topological crystalline insulators. We establish the above higher-order
bulk-boundary correspondence through a dimensional reduction technique, which
also allows for a systematic classification of 2D AFHOTIs protected by point
group symmetries. We demonstrate applications of our theory to two concrete,
experimentally feasible models of AFHOTIs protected by $C_2$ and $D_4$
symmetries, respectively. Our work paves the way for a unified theory for
classifying and characterizing Floquet topological matters.

law which could unequivocally link the gas and the star formation rate (SFR)
densities measured on sub-kiloparsec scale in star-forming galaxies. The
conventional approach of using the observed surface densities to infer star
formation laws has however revealed a major and well-known issue, as such
relations are valid for the high-density regions of galaxies but break down in
low-density and HI-dominated environments. Recently, an empirical correlation
between the total gas (HI+H$_2$) and the star formation rate (SFR) volume
densities was obtained for a sample of nearby disc galaxies and for the Milky
Way. This volumetric star formation (VSF) law is a single power-law with no
break and a smaller intrinsic scatter with respect to the star formation laws
based on the surface density. In this work, we explore the VSF law in the
regime of dwarf galaxies in order to test its validity in HI-dominated,
low-density, and low-metallicity environments. In addition, we assess this
relation in the outskirts of spiral galaxies, which are low-density and
HI-dominated regions similar to dwarf galaxies. Remarkably, we find the VSF
law, namely $\rho_\mathrm{SFR} \propto \rho_\mathrm{gas}^\alpha$ with $\alpha
\approx 2$, is valid for both these regimes. This result indicates that the VSF
law, which holds unbroken for a wide range of gas ($\approx 3$ dex) and SFR
($\approx 6$ dex) volume densities, is the empirical relation with the smallest
intrinsic scatter and is likely more fundamental than surface-based star
formation laws.

$\sim$300 days. Large-scale planetary migration through the disk has long been
suspected to be the physical origin of this feature, as the timescale of
standard Type I migration in a standard solar nebula is longer farther from the
star. These calculations also find that typical Jupiter-bearing cores shuttle
towards the disk inner edge on timescales orders of magnitude shorter than the
gas disk lifetime. The presence of gas giants at myriad distances requires
mechanisms to slow large-scale migration. We revisit the migration paradigm by
deriving model occurrence rate profiles from migration of cores, mass growth by
gas accretion, and planetary gap opening. We show explicitly that the former
two processes occur in tandem. Radial transport of planets can slow down
significantly once deep gaps are carved out by their interaction with disk gas.
Disks are more easily perturbed closer to the star, so accounting for gap
opening flattens the final orbital period distribution. To recover the observed
rise in occurrence rate, gas giants need to be more massive farther out, which
is naturally achieved if their envelopes are dust-free. The range of mass
gradients we find to reconcile the observed occurrence rate of Jupiters is too
abrupt to account for the mass-period distribution of low-eccentricity giant
planets, challenging disk migration as the dominant origin channel of hot and
warm Jupiters. Future efforts in characterizing the unbiased mass distribution
will place stronger constraints on predictions from migration theory.

for elliptical galaxies and tidal torquing for spiral galaxies. In this study,
we use morphologically selected samples of elliptical and spiral galaxies from
the IllustrisTNG simulation at z=0 and z=1 to test the commonly employed linear

alignments. We obtain local measurements of the linear and quadratic alignment
parameters, including corrections for large-scale anisotropies of the
cosmologically small simulation volume, and study their dependence on galaxy

elliptical galaxies (linear model), that increases with mass and redshift.
Spiral galaxies (quadratic model) on the other hand exhibit a significant
signal only for the most massive objects at z=1. We show the quadratic model
for spiral galaxies to break down at its fundamental assumptions, and
simultaneously obtain a significant signal of spiral galaxies to align

compute intrinsic alignment spectra and estimate the expected contamination in

constituting over 80% of the energy released in fission (E$_{f}$ $\approx$ 200
MeV). While the TKE release in the $^{239}$Pu(n,f) reaction was previously
measured up to 50 MeV incident neutron energy (E$_{n}$), there were features in
TKE release at the highest values of E$_{n}$ that were puzzling. There was a
marked flattening of TKE release from E$_{n}$ = 30 to 50 MeV, in disagreement
with the clearly decreasing TKE observed from E$_{n}$ = 0.5 to 30 MeV. To
verify and clarify this trend, TKE measurements at higher values of E$_n$ were
made. We present absolute measurements of TKE release in $^{239}$Pu(n,f) from
E$_{n}$ = 2.4 to 100 MeV. We used silicon PIN detectors to measure the fragment

fission asymmetry and the relationships between approximate fission fragment

optimization problem. For deterministic bilevel optimization, we provide a
comprehensive convergence rate analysis for two popular algorithms respectively
based on approximate implicit differentiation (AID) and iterative
differentiation (ITD). For the AID-based method, we orderwisely improve the
previous convergence rate analysis due to a more practical parameter selection
as well as a warm start strategy, and for the ITD-based method we establish the
first theoretical convergence rate. Our analysis also provides a quantitative
comparison between ITD and AID based approaches. For stochastic bilevel
optimization, we propose a novel algorithm named stocBiO, which features a
sample-efficient hypergradient estimator using efficient Jacobian- and
Hessian-vector product computations. We provide the convergence rate guarantee
for stocBiO, and show that stocBiO outperforms the best known computational
complexities orderwisely with respect to the condition number $\kappa$ and the
target accuracy $\epsilon$. We further validate our theoretical results and
demonstrate the efficiency of bilevel optimization algorithms by the

phenomena, including high-temperature superconductivity. Simulating these
systems on quantum computers may avoid the prohibitively high computational
cost incurred in classical approaches. However, systematic errors and
decoherence effects presented in current quantum devices make it difficult to
achieve this. Here, we simulate the dynamics of the one-dimensional
Fermi-Hubbard model using 16 qubits on a digital superconducting quantum
processor. We observe separations in the spreading velocities of charge and
spin densities in the highly excited regime, a regime that is beyond the
conventional quasiparticle picture. To minimize systematic errors, we introduce
an accurate gate calibration procedure that is fast enough to capture temporal
drifts of the gate parameters. We also employ a sequence of error-mitigation
techniques to reduce decoherence effects and residual systematic errors. These
procedures allow us to simulate the time evolution of the model faithfully
despite having over 600 two-qubit gates in our circuits. Our experiment charts
a path to practical quantum simulation of strongly correlated phenomena using

the occurrence of horizonless exotic compact objects, as an alternative to
classical black holes, are more natural. These exotic compact objects carry a
distinctive signature of the higher dimension, namely a tidal charge parameter,
inherited from the projection of the higher dimensional Weyl tensor onto the
four dimensional spacetime we live in. Due to the absence of any horizon,
rotating exotic compact objects are often unstable because of superradiance.
Interestingly, these higher dimensional exotic compact objects, in the presence
of the tidal charge, are more stable than their four dimensional counterpart. A
similar inference is drawn by analysing the static modes associated with these
exotic compact objects, irrespective of the nature of the perturbation i.e., it
holds true for scalar, electromagnetic and also gravitational perturbation. The
post-merger ringdown phase of the exotic compact object in the braneworld
scenario, which can be described in terms of the quasi-normal modes, holds
plethora of information regarding the nature of the higher dimension. In this
connection we have discussed the analytical computation of the quasi-normal
modes as well as their numerical estimation for perturbations of arbitrary
spin, depicting existence of echoes in the ringdown waveform. As we have
demonstrated, the echoes in the ringdown waveform depends explicitly on the
tidal charge parameter and hence its future detection can provide constraints
on the tidal charge parameter, which in turn will enable us to provide a
possible bound on the length of the extra dimension.

comes from the classical contribution of two higher-derivative terms in the
effective field theory. In this note, we explain the structure of operators
localized at the edge of the droplet, where the density drops to zero. We list
all operators contributing to the ground-state energy with nonnegative powers
of Q in the large-Q expansion. As a test, we use dimensional regularization to
reproduce the calculation of the NLO ground state energy by Kravec and Pal ,
and we recover the same universal coefficient for the logarithmic term as in
that work. We refine the derivation by presenting a systematic operator
analysis of the possible edge counterterms, showing that different choices of
cutoff procedures must yield the same renormalized result up to an enumerable
list of Wilson coefficients for conformally invariant local counterterms at the
droplet edge. We also demonstrate the existence of a previously unnoticed edge
contribution to the ground-state operator dimension of order Q^{{2\over 3} -

the years many versions have been developed, however, a comprehensive
theoretical treatment of RB has been missing. In this work, we develop a
rigorous framework of RB general enough to encompass virtually all known
protocols as well as novel, more flexible extensions. Overcoming previous
limitations on error models and gate sets, this framework allows us, for the
first time, to formulate realistic conditions under which we can rigorously
guarantee that the output of any RB experiment is well-described by a linear
combination of matrix exponential decays. We complement this with a detailed
analysis of the fitting problem associated with RB data. We introduce modern
signal processing techniques to RB, prove analytical sample complexity bounds,
and numerically evaluate performance and limitations. In order to reduce the
resource demands of this fitting problem, we introduce novel, scalable
post-processing techniques to isolate exponential decays, significantly
improving the practical feasibility of a large set of RB protocols. These
post-processing techniques overcome shortcomings in efficiency of several
previously proposed methods such as character benchmarking and linear-cross
entropy benchmarking. Finally, we discuss, in full generality, how and when RB
decay rates can be used to infer quality measures like the average fidelity. On

demographic information like gender and race. However, the extent to which
black-box commercial face recognition algorithms (CFRAs) use gender and race
features to determine identity is poorly understood despite increasing
deployments by government and industry. In this study, we quantified the degree
to which gender and race features influenced face recognition similarity scores
between different people, i.e. non-mated scores. We ran this study using five
different CFRAs and a sample of 333 diverse test subjects. As a control, we
compared the behavior of these non-mated distributions to a commercial iris
recognition algorithm (CIRA). Confirming prior work, all CFRAs produced higher
similarity scores for people of the same gender and race, an effect known as
""broad homogeneity"". No such effect was observed for the CIRA. Next, we applied
principal components analysis (PCA) to similarity score matrices. We show that
some principal components (PCs) of CFRAs cluster people by gender and race, but
the majority do not. Demographic clustering in the PCs accounted for only 10 %
of the total CFRA score variance. No clustering was observed for the CIRA. This
demonstrates that, although CFRAs use some gender and race features to
establish identity, most features utilized by current CFRAs are unrelated to
gender and race, similar to the iris texture patterns utilized by the CIRA.
Finally, reconstruction of similarity score matrices using only PCs that showed
no demographic clustering reduced broad homogeneity effects, but also decreased
the separation between mated and non-mated scores. This suggests it's possible
for CFRAs to operate on features unrelated to gender and race, albeit with

form factors for the unphysical $B_s\to\eta_s$ decay, over the full physical
range of $q^2$. This is a useful testing ground both for lattice QCD and for
our wider understanding of the behaviour of form factors. Calculations were
performed using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action on $N_f = 2 +
1 + 1$ gluon ensembles generated by the MILC Collaboration with an improved
gluon action and HISQ sea quarks. We use three lattice spacings and a range of
heavy quark masses from that of charm to bottom, all in the HISQ formalism.
This permits an extrapolation in the heavy quark mass and lattice spacing to
the physical point and nonperturbative renormalisation of the vector matrix
element on the lattice. We find results in good agreement with previous work
using nonrelativistic QCD $b$ quarks and with reduced errors at low $q^2$,
supporting the effectiveness of our heavy HISQ technique as a method for
calculating form factors involving heavy quarks. A comparison with results for
other decays related by SU(3) flavour symmetry shows that the impact of
changing the light daughter quark is substantial but changing the spectator
quark has very little effect. We also map out form factor shape parameters as a
function of heavy quark mass and compare to heavy quark effective theory
expectations for mass scaling at low and high recoil. This work represents an
important step in the progression from previous work on heavy-to-heavy decays
($b\to c$) to the numerically more challenging heavy-to-light decays.

ideal conditions and an extension to deep neural networks is provided. In the
former case we obtain an asymptotic bound of

This study concludes our survey of 70 galactic Cepheids using the {\it Hubble
Space Telescope\} (\HST) Wide Field Camera~3 (WFC3) with images at two
wavelengths to identify companions closer than $5\arcsec$. In the entire WFC3
survey we identify 16 probable companions for 13 Cepheids. The seven Cepheids
having resolved candidate companions within $2""$ all have the surprising
property of themselves being spectroscopic binaries (as compared with a 29\%
incidence of spectroscopic binaries in the general Cepheid population). That is
a strong suggestion that an inner binary is linked to the scenario of a third
companion within a few hundred~AU\null. This characteristic is continued for
more widely separated companions. Under a model where the outer companion is
formed first, it is unlikely that it can anticipate a subsequent inner binary.
Rather it is more likely that a triple system has undergone dynamical
interaction, resulting in one star moving outward to its current location. {\it
Chandra\} and {\it Gaia\} data as well as radial velocities and \HSTSTIS and
{\it IUE\} spectra are used to derive properties of the components of the

colors for closer companions, to only low-mass companions for wider
separations.

named Video-and-Language Event Prediction (VLEP), with 28,726 future event

continuum emission maps is common in protoplanetary disks. These substructures,
most prominently rings and gaps, shape and change the chemical and physical
conditions of the disk, along with the dust size distributions. In this work,
we use a thermochemical code to focus on the chemical evolution that is
occurring within the gas-depleted gap and the dust-rich ring often observed
behind it. The composition of these spatial locations are of great import, as
the gas and ice-coated grains will end up being part of the atmospheres of gas
giants and/or the seeds of rocky planets. Our models show that the dust
temperature at the midplane of the gap increases, enough to produce local
sublimation of key volatiles and pushing the molecular layer closer to the
midplane, while it decreases in the dust-rich ring, causing a higher volatile
deposition onto the dust grain surfaces. Further, the ring itself presents a
freeze-out trap for volatiles in local flows powered by forming planets,
becoming a site of localized volatile enhancement. Within the gas depleted gap,
the line emission depends on several different parameters, such as: the depth
of the gap in surface density, the location of the dust substructure, and the
abundance of common gas tracers, such as CO. In order to break this uncertainty
between abundance and surface density, other methods such as disk kinematics,
become necessary to constrain the disk structure and its chemical evolution.

that removing training data with high Shapley values decreased the pneumonia

of different elements of DRL models and how they might impact the final
performance. To that end, we choose the Frequency Plan Design (FPD) problem in
the context of multibeam satellite constellations as our use case and propose a
DRL model to address it. We identify 6 different core elements that have a
major effect in its performance: the policy, the policy optimizer, the state,
action, and reward representations, and the training environment. We analyze
different alternatives for each of these elements and characterize their
effect. We also use multiple environments to account for different scenarios in
which we vary the dimensionality or make the environment nonstationary. Our
findings show that DRL is a potential method to address the FPD problem in real
operations, especially because of its speed in decision-making. However, no

approach for each of the 6 core elements depends on the features of the
operation environment. While we agree on the potential of DRL to solve future

incremental setting, when new categories are added over time. On the one hand,
repeatedly training the representation on the extended dataset is
time-consuming. On the other hand, fine-tuning the learned representation only
with the new classes leads to catastrophic forgetting. To this end, we propose
an incremental learning method to mitigate retrieval performance degradation
caused by the forgetting issue. Without accessing any samples of the original
classes, the classifier of the original network provides soft ""labels"" to
transfer knowledge to train the adaptive network, so as to preserve the
previous capability for classification. More importantly, a regularization
function based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy is devised to minimize the
discrepancy of new classes features from the original network and the adaptive
network, respectively. Extensive experiments on two datasets show that our
method effectively mitigates the catastrophic forgetting on the original
classes while achieving high performance on the new classes.

posterior as a Gaussian distribution is a fundamental linear algebra problem
that must be solved for both the mean and key entries of the covariance. Even
when the true posterior is not Gaussian (e.g., in the case of nonlinear
measurement functions) we can use variational schemes that repeatedly solve
this linear algebra problem at each iteration. In most cases, the question is
not whether a solution to this problem exists, but rather how we can exploit
problem-specific structure to find it efficiently. Our contribution is to
clearly state the Fundamental Linear Algebra Problem of Gaussian Inference
(FLAPOGI) and to provide a novel presentation (using Kronecker algebra) of the
not-so-well-known result of Takahashi et al. (1973) that makes it possible to
solve for key entries of the covariance matrix. We first provide a global
solution and then a local version that can be implemented using local message
passing amongst a collection of agents calculating in parallel. Contrary to
belief propagation, our local scheme is guaranteed to converge in both the mean
and desired covariance quantities to the global solution even when the
underlying factor graph is loopy; in the case of synchronous updates, we
provide a bound on the number of iterations required for convergence. Compared
to belief propagation, this guaranteed convergence comes at the cost of
additional storage, calculations, and communication links in the case of loops;
however, we show how these can be automatically constructed on the fly using
only local information.

  Rewards","9 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Consider a typical organization whose worker agents seek to collectively
cooperate for its general betterment. However, each individual agent
simultaneously seeks to act to secure a larger chunk than its co-workers of the
annual increment in compensation, which usually comes from a {\em fixed} pot.
As such, the individual agent in the organization must cooperate and compete.
Another feature of many organizations is that a worker receives a bonus, which
is often a fraction of previous year's total profit. As such, the agent derives
a reward that is also partly dependent on historical performance. How should
the individual agent decide to act in this context? Few methods for the mixed
cooperative-competitive setting have been presented in recent years, but these
are challenged by problem domains whose reward functions do not depend on the
current state and action only. Recent deep multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) methods using long short-term memory (LSTM) may be used, but these adopt
a joint perspective to the interaction or require explicit exchange of
information among the agents to promote cooperation, which may not be possible
under competition. In this paper, we first show that the agent's
decision-making problem can be modeled as an interactive partially observable
Markov decision process (I-POMDP) that captures the dynamic of a
history-dependent reward. We present an interactive advantage actor-critic
method (IA2C$^+$), which combines the independent advantage actor-critic
network with a belief filter that maintains a belief distribution over other
agents' models. Empirical results show that IA2C$^+$ learns the optimal policy
faster and more robustly than several other baselines including one that uses a

including images of spiral drawings taken via graphic tablets from patients
with Parkinson Disease and healthy subjects, and point-of-care ultrasound
images on the lungs of patients with COVID-19, those with pneumonia and healthy

higher classification accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score brought about by
either quantum AFs on five of the seven bench-mark datasets, thus demonstrating

explained as overfitting, our analysis suggest that its primary cause is
perturbation underfitting. We observe that after training for too long,
FGSM-generated perturbations deteriorate into random noise. Intuitively, since
no parameter updates are made to strengthen the perturbation generator, once
this process collapses, it could be trapped in such local optima. Also,
sophisticating this process could mostly avoid the robustness drop, which
supports that this phenomenon is caused by underfitting instead of overfitting.

training framework, which parameterizes perturbation generation and
progressively strengthens them. Shielding perturbations from underfitting

layer-wise learning can achieve state-of-the-art performance in image
classification on various datasets. However, previous studies of layer-wise
learning are limited to networks with simple hierarchical structures, and the
performance decreases severely for deeper networks like ResNet. This paper, for
the first time, reveals the fundamental reason that impedes the scale-up of
layer-wise learning is due to the relatively poor separability of the feature
space in shallow layers. This argument is empirically verified by controlling
the intensity of the convolution operation in local layers. We discover that
the poorly-separable features from shallow layers are mismatched with the
strong supervision constraint throughout the entire network, making the
layer-wise learning sensitive to network depth. The paper further proposes a
downsampling acceleration approach to weaken the poor learning of shallow
layers so as to transfer the learning emphasis to deep feature space where the
separability matches better with the supervision restraint. Extensive
experiments have been conducted to verify the new finding and demonstrate the
advantages of the proposed downsampling acceleration in improving the
performance of layer-wise learning.

the related concept of orbit types as a starting point for developing a
geometric perspective on statistics. We aim at deriving a general mathematical
setting for studying the behavior of empirical and population means in spaces
ranging from smooth Riemannian manifolds to general stratified spaces. We fully

challenging task because of the quick fading of the observed flux. In order to
create an efficient observing strategy for their observing method it is crucial
to know their intrinsic rate. Unfortunately, the numerous models existing today
predict this rate on a vary wide range. Hence, our goal in this paper is to
investigate the effect of different level of approximations on the relative
rate predictions. Also, we study the effect of distinct ejecta mass lay-outs on
the light curve. We find that the ratio of the expected kilonova detections of
the spherical to axisymmetrical models is 6:1 (or 2:1, depending on the input
parameter set applied in our work). Nevertheless, the light curve shape is only
slightly affected by the various ejecta alignments. This means that different
ejecta layouts can produce light curves with similar shapes making it a
challenging task to infer the structure of the matter outflow. Thus, we
conclude that the uncertainty in the rate predictions arising from the various
ejecta mass distribution models is negligible compared to the errors present in
other input parameters (e.g. binary neutron star merger rate). In addition, we
show that up to moderate redshifts (z < 0.2) the redshift distribution type
(observed or uniform in volume) does not affect the expected relative rate
estimations.

lot of attention for several data management tasks. Given a query and the data,
the task is to preprocess the data and then enumerate all the answers to the
query one by one and without repetitions. This enumeration scheme is typically
useful when the solutions are treated on the fly or when we want to stop the
enumeration once the pertinent solutions have been found. However, with the
current schemes, there is no restriction on the order how the solutions are
given and this order usually depends on the techniques used and not on the
relevance for the user.
  In this paper we study the enumeration of monadic second order logic (MSO)
over words when the solutions are ranked. We present a framework based on MSO
cost functions that allows to express MSO formulae on words with a cost
associated with each solution. We then demonstrate the generality of our
framework which subsumes, for instance, document spanners and regular complex
event processing queries and adds ranking to them. The main technical result of
the paper is an algorithm for enumerating all the solutions of formulae in
increasing order of cost efficiently, namely, with a linear preprocessing phase
and logarithmic delay between solutions. The novelty of this algorithm is based
on using functional data structures, in particular, by extending functional
Brodal queues to suit with the ranked enumeration of MSO on words.

the architecture of the inner planets, in particular their mutual inclinations.
The dynamical perturbation from cold Jupiters may account for the population of
misaligned planets in the Kepler data. The effectiveness of this mechanism can
be hindered by a strong planet--planet coupling in the inner system. In this
paper, we study how mean-motion resonances (MMRs) affect this coupling and the
expected misalignment. We derive approximate analytical expressions for the
mutual inclination excitations in the inner planet system induced by an
inclined companion, for various period ratios and perturber properties. In most
cases, the mutual inclination is proportional to a dimensionless parameter that
characterizes the strength of the perturber relative to the coupling in the

mutual inclination induced by the perturber by a factor of a few. We find that
the resonance is resilient to the perturbation, and derive a criterion for the
libration of the resonant angle. Our results have applications for constraining

luminosities, momenta and momentum flow rates as a function of radial distance
for each of the targets. For the sample, masses are several times 10^3 - 10^7

extended [O~III] emission, but compact outflow regions. This may be due to
different mass profiles or different evolutionary histories.

  We propose to scale human grading by augmenting the manual grading process
with an equivalence algorithm that can identify the equivalences between
student submissions. This enables human graders to give targeted feedback for
multiple student submissions at once. Our technique is conservative in two
aspects. First, it identifies equivalence between submissions that are
algorithmically similar, e.g., it cannot identify the equivalence between
quicksort and mergesort. Second, it uses formal methods instead of clustering
algorithms from the machine learning literature. This allows us to prove a
soundness result that guarantees that submissions will never be clustered

similarity and the ability to formally prove equivalence, we show that our

robust stability and performance constraints as well as noise-sensitivity. The
constraints on the design parameters of the DOb change when the digital motion

waterbed effect is removed when the DOb is implemented by acceleration

playground to examine interactions of correlated electronic states, such as
ferroelectricity, topological surface states, and superconductivity. Making
SnTe into nanowires further induces novel electronic states due to
one-dimensional (1D) confinement effects. Thus, for transport measurements,
SnTe nanowires must be made narrow in their diameters to ensure the 1D
confinement and phase coherence of the topological surface electrons. This
study reports a facile growth method to produce narrow SnTe nanowires with a
high yield using alloy nanoparticles as growth catalysts. The average diameter
of the SnTe nanowires grown using the alloy nanoparticles is 85 nm, nearly a
factor of three reduction from the previous average diameter of 240 nm using
gold nanoparticles as growth catalysts. Transport measurements reveal the
effect of the nanowire diameter on the residual resistance ratio and
magnetoresistance. Particularly, the ferroelectric transition temperature for
SnTe is observed to change systematically with the nanowire diameter. In situ
cryogenic cooling of narrow SnTe nanowires in a transmission electron
microscope directly reveals the cubic to rhombohedral structural transition,
which is associated with the ferroelectric transition. Thus, these narrow SnTe
nanowires represent a model system to study electronic states arising from the

play an important role in phylogenetics. Unfortunately, these indices are
specifically designed for phylogenetic trees, and do not extend naturally to
phylogenetic networks (which are increasingly used to describe reticulate
evolution). This led us to consider a lesser-known balance index, whose
definition is based on a probabilistic interpretation that is equally
applicable to trees and to networks. This index, known as the $B_2$ index, was
first proposed by Shao and Sokal in 1990. Surprisingly, it does not seem to
have been studied mathematically since. Likewise, it is used only sporadically
in the biological literature, where it tends to be viewed as arcane. In this
paper, we study mathematical properties of $B_2$ such as its expectation and
variance under the most common models of random trees and its extremal values
over various classes of phylogenetic networks. We also assess its relevance in
biological applications, and find it to be comparable to that of the Colless
and Sackin indices. Altogether, our results call for a reevaluation of the
status of this somewhat forgotten measure of phylogenetic balance.

is a change in the frequency of a quantum harmonic oscillator (HO)? To do this,
we investigate the behavior of a HO, initially in its fundamental state, by
making a frequency transition that we can control how fast it occurs. The
resulting state of the system is shown to be a vacuum squeezed state in two
bases related by Bogoliubov transformations. We characterize the time evolution
of the squeezing parameter in both bases and discuss its relation with
adiabaticity by changing the rate of the frequency transition from sudden to
adiabatic. Finally, we obtain an analytical approximate expression that relates
squeezing to the transition rate as well as the initial and final frequencies.
Our results shed some light on subtleties and common inaccuracies in the

the following: if the largest induced cycle in $H$ has length at most $5$, then
there is an $O(m\log m)$ algorithm for counting $H$-homomorphisms in bounded

in two key aspects: (1) musical token is multi-faceted -- it comprises of
pitch, rhythm and dynamics information; and (2) musical context is
two-dimensional -- each musical token is dependent on both melodic and harmonic
contexts. In this work, we provide a comprehensive solution by proposing a
novel framework named PiRhDy that integrates pitch, rhythm, and dynamics
information seamlessly. PiRhDy adopts a hierarchical strategy which can be
decomposed into two steps: (1) token (i.e., note event) modeling, which
separately represents pitch, rhythm, and dynamics and integrates them into a
single token embedding; and (2) context modeling, which utilizes melodic and
harmonic knowledge to train the token embedding. A thorough study was made on
each component and sub-strategy of PiRhDy. We further validate our embeddings
in three downstream tasks -- melody completion, accompaniment suggestion, and
genre classification. Results indicate a significant advancement of the neural
approach towards symbolic music as well as PiRhDy's potential as a pretrained

arrangements using a virtual-reality headset. The results from participants'
movement accuracy, task completion time, and usability questionnaires indicate
that participants had significant performance differences on two levels of the
game based on its difficulty (between-subjects factor), but no difference in
seated and standing configurations (within-subjects factor). Also, the hard
mode was more favorable among participants. This work offers implications on
virtual reality and 3D-interactive systems, with specific contributions to
virtual therapy, and serious games for healthcare applications.

assistants is to extract semantic concepts from an utterance, called slot
filling. Although existing slot filling models attempted to improve extracting
new concepts that are not seen in training data, the performance in practice is
still not satisfied. Recent research collected question and answer annotated
data to learn what is unknown and should be asked, yet not practically scalable
due to the heavy data collection effort. In this paper, we incorporate
softmax-based slot filling neural architectures to model the sequence
uncertainty without question supervision. We design a Dirichlet Prior RNN to
model high-order uncertainty by degenerating as softmax layer for RNN model
training. To further enhance the uncertainty modeling robustness, we propose a
novel multi-task training to calibrate the Dirichlet concentration parameters.
We collect unseen concepts to create two test datasets from SLU benchmark
datasets Snips and ATIS. On these two and another existing Concept Learning
benchmark datasets, we show that our approach significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches by up to 8.18%. Our method is generic and can be
applied to any RNN or Transformer based slot filling models with a softmax
layer.

Sadovskii vortex. The map is employed to determine the potential flow outside
the vortex and the vortex domain boundary provided the circulation $\Gamma$
around the vortex and constant speed $U$ on the vortex boundary are prescribed,
and there are no stagnation points on the walls. The map is expressed in terms
of a rational function on an elliptic surface topologically equivalent to a

semi-infinite segments on the same genus-1 Riemann surface. Owing to its
special features, the Riemann-Hilbert problem requires a novel analogue of the
Cauchy kernel on an elliptic surface. Such a kernel is proposed and employed to
derive a closed-form solution to the Riemann-Hilbert problem and the associated

free geometric parameter and two model parameters, the wedge angle $\alpha$ and
$\Gamma/U$. It is shown that when $\alpha<\pi$ the solution exists and the
vortex has two cusps, while the solution does not exist when the wedge angle

recent studies apply global and local adversarial losses extensively to

MExGAN for semantic editing on segmentation map, which uses a novel

MEx area has the mask area of the generation as the majority and the boundary
of original context as the minority. To boost convenience and stability of MEx
loss, we further propose an Approximated MEx (A-MEx) loss. Besides, in contrast
to previous model that builds training data for semantic editing on
segmentation map with part of the whole image, which leads to model performance

algorithm is proposed. DCS exploits the inter-signal correlations and has the
capability to jointly recover multiple sparse signals. Proposed approach is a
Bayesian decentralized algorithm which uses the type 1 joint sparsity model
(JSM-1) and exploits the intra-signal correlations, as well as the inter-signal
correlations. Compared to the conventional DCS algorithm, which only exploit
the joint sparsity of the signals, the proposed approach takes the intra- and
inter-scale dependencies among the wavelet coefficients into account to enable
the utilization of the individual signal structure. Furthermore, the Bessel
K-form (BKF) is used as the prior distribution which has a sharper peak at zero
and heavier tails than the Gaussian distribution. The variational Bayesian (VB)
inference is employed to perform the posterior distributions and acquire a
closed-form solution for model parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm have good recovery performance in comparison with
state-of the-art techniques.

dramatically improved intelligibility and naturalness of generated speech from

voice is still a challenge. The main reason is that it is not easy to obtain a
bilingual corpus from a speaker who achieves native-level fluency in both
languages. In this paper, we explore the use of Mandarin speech recordings from
a Mandarin speaker, and English speech recordings from another English speaker
to build high-quality bilingual and code-switched TTS for both speakers. A
Tacotron2-based cross-lingual voice conversion system is employed to generate
the Mandarin speaker's English speech and the English speaker's Mandarin
speech, which show good naturalness and speaker similarity. The obtained
bilingual data are then augmented with code-switched utterances synthesized
using a Transformer model. With these data, three neural TTS models --
Tacotron2, Transformer and FastSpeech are applied for building bilingual and
code-switched TTS. Subjective evaluation results show that all the three
systems can produce (near-)native-level speech in both languages for each of
the speaker.

routinely used standard machine-learning classifiers like artificial neural

Traditionally, these have provided few insights into which features of the EEG

it harder to improve the HMI and human-machine trust relationship. A key
ingredient to applying trust-sensor research results to practical situations

bands of 24Mg have been investigated by the inelastic scatterings of various
probes, including electrons, protons, and alpha particles, for a prolonged
time. However, it has been challenging to explain the unique properties of the
scatterings observed for the $4^+_1$ state through reaction calculations.
Purpose: To investigate the structure and transition properties of the K=0+ and
K=2+ bands of 24Mg employing the microscopic structure and reaction
calculations via inelastic proton and alpha-scattering. Particularly, the E4
transitions to the $4^+_1$ and $4^+_2$ states were reexamined. Method: The
structure of 24Mg was calculated employing the variation after the parity and
total-angular momentum projections in the framework of the antisymmetrized
molecular dynamics(AMD). The inelastic proton and alpha reactions were
calculated by the microscopic coupled-channel (MCC) approach by folding the
Melbourne g-matrix NN interaction with the AMD densities of 24Mg. Results:
Reasonable results were obtained on the properties of the structure, including
the energy spectra and E2 and E4 transitions of the K=0+ and K=2+ bands owing
to the enhanced collectivity of triaxial deformation. The MCC+AMD calculation
successfully reproduced the angular distributions of the $4^+_1$ and $4^+_2$
cross sections of proton scattering at incident energies of $E_p$=40--100MeV
and alpha-scattering at $E_\alpha$=100--400MeV. Conclusions: This is the first
microscopic calculation that described the unique properties of the $0^+_1\to
4^+_1$ transition. In the inelastic scattering to the $4^+_1$ state, the
dominant two-step process of the $0^+_1\to 2^+_1\to 4^+_1$ transitions and the
deconstructive interference is the weak one-step process were essential.

determined by the dynamics of ions confined in nanoporous materials, which has
attracted intensive interest in nanoscopic research. Many nanoscopic
understandings, including changes in in-pore ion concentration and mobility
during dynamical processes, are continuously reported. However, quantitative
scale-up of these nanoscopic understandings for evaluation of the macroscopic
performance of supercapacitors is difficult due to the absence of links between
these scales. Here we demonstrate that machine learning can be used to
establish such links. Starting from nanoscale, we first reveal a
diffusion-enhanced migration of ions in nanopores using primarily modified
Poisson-Nernst-Planck model, unlike in bulk electrolyte where diffusion
counteracts migration. Using machine learning, we discover a dynamically
varying ionic resistance and its equation, resulting from the in-pore ion
concentration change contributed by diffusion-enhanced migration. The obtained
equation is used to construct a nano-circuitry model (NCM), which describes
both the macroscopic performance of supercapacitors and nanometre-resolved
ionic behaviour. We demonstrate that NCM can provide additional perspectives to
understand cyclic voltammograms. A Faradaic-like current peak can show in
non-Faradaic processes, and an asymmetric charging/discharging can occur
without ion desolvation. These is because the dynamically varying resistance
delivers ions effectively for storage. The demonstrated use of machine learning
could extend to other ionic systems including batteries and desalination,
paving the route towards rational design.

on the classical Laplacian (Dirichlet) eigenvalue problem in 1D to illustrate
the idea and then use the tensor-product structure to generate the stiffness
and mass matrices for multiple dimensional problems. To remove the outliers, we
penalize the product of the higher-order derivatives from both the solution and
test spaces at the domain boundary. Intuitively, we construct a better
approximation by weakly imposing features of the exact solution. Effectively,
we add terms to the variational formulation at the boundaries with minimal
extra computational cost. We then generalize the idea to remove the outliers
for the isogeometric analysis to the Neumann eigenvalue problem (for $p\ge2$).
The boundary penalization does not change the test and solution spaces. In the
limiting case when the penalty goes to infinity, we perform the dispersion

recognition. Unlike other modalities, constellation of joints and their motion
generate models with succinct human motion information for activity
recognition. We present a new model for joint-based action recognition, which
first extracts motion features from each joint separately through a shared
motion encoder before performing collective reasoning. Our joint selector
module re-weights the joint information to select the most discriminative
joints for the task. We also propose a novel joint-contrastive loss that pulls
together groups of joint features which convey the same action. We strengthen
the joint-based representations by using a geometry-aware data augmentation
technique which jitters pose heatmaps while retaining the dynamics of the
action. We show large improvements over the current state-of-the-art
joint-based approaches on JHMDB, HMDB, Charades, AVA action recognition

improvements. Our model also outperforms the existing baseline on Mimetics, a

planes of strongly bonded one-dimensional chains more weakly bonded to

calculated using density functional theory combined with an iterative solution
of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The phonon velocities and the
thermal conductivities of TaSe3 are considerably more anisotropic than those of
ZrTe3. The maximum LA velocity in ZrTe3 occurs in the cross-chain direction,
and this is consistent with the strong cross-chain bonding that gives rise to
large Fermi velocities in that direction. The thermal conductivities are
similar to those of other metallic two-dimensional transition metal
dichalcogenides. At room temperature, a significant portion of the heat is
carried by the optical modes. In the low frequency range, the phonon lifetimes
and mean free paths in TaSe3 are considerably shorter than those in ZrTe3. The
shorter lifetimes in TaSe3 are consistent with the presence of lower frequency
optical branches and zone-folding features in the acoustic branches that arise
due to the doubling of the TaSe3 unit cell within the plane.

Existing methods of structural characterization of nacre rely on some form of

caused extensive discussions on social media. A part of the content on US
elections is organic, coming from users discussing their opinions of the
candidates, political positions, or relevant content presented on television.
Another significant part of the content generated originates from organized
campaigns, both official and by astroturfing.
  In this study, we obtain approximately 17.5M tweets containing 3M users,
based on prevalent hashtags related to US election 2020, as well as the related
YouTube links, contained in the Twitter dataset, likes, dislikes and comments
of the videos and conduct volume, sentiment and graph analysis on the
communities formed.
  Particularly, we study the daily traffic per prevalent hashtags, plot the
retweet graph from July to September 2020, show how its main connected
component becomes denser in the period closer to the elections and highlight
the two main entities ('Biden' and 'Trump'). Additionally, we gather the
related YouTube links contained in the previous dataset and perform sentiment
analysis. The results on sentiment analysis on the Twitter corpus and the
YouTube metadata gathered, show the positive and negative sentiment for the two
entities throughout this period. The results of sentiment analysis indicate
that 45.7% express positive sentiment towards Trump in Twitter and 33.8%
positive sentiment towards Biden, while 14.55% of users express positive
sentiment in YouTube metadata gathered towards Trump and 8.7% positive
sentiment towards Biden. Our analysis fill the gap between the connection of
offline events and their consequences in social media by monitoring important
events in real world and measuring public volume and sentiment before and after
the event in social media.

- an online variant of the problem where agents are immediately assigned a new
goal upon reaching their current one - in dense and highly structured
environments, typical of real-world warehouse operations. Effectively solving
LMAPF in such environments requires expensive coordination between agents as
well as frequent replanning abilities, a daunting task for existing coupled and
decoupled approaches alike. With the purpose of achieving considerable agent
coordination without any compromise on reactivity and scalability, we introduce
PRIMAL2, a distributed reinforcement learning framework for LMAPF where agents
learn fully decentralized policies to reactively plan paths online in a
partially observable world. We extend our previous work, which was effective in
low-density sparsely occupied worlds, to highly structured and constrained
worlds by identifying behaviors and conventions which improve implicit agent
coordination, and enable their learning through the construction of a novel
local agent observation and various training aids. We present extensive results
of PRIMAL2 in both MAPF and LMAPF environments and compare its performance to
state-of-the-art planners in terms of makespan and throughput. We show that
PRIMAL2 significantly surpasses our previous work and performs comparably to

nature of existing video generation models' ability to handle arbitrary

integrates the learned dynamics function to synthesize video frames at any

to the set of mechanisms driving the dynamics of neuronal connections, called

Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) is a biologically-based model
representing the time evolution of the synaptic weight as a functional of the
past spiking activity of adjacent neurons.
  If numerous models of neuronal cells have been proposed in the mathematical
literature, few of them include a variable for the time-varying strength of the

synaptic plasticity associated to different STDP rules. The system composed of
two neurons connected by a single synapse is investigated and a stochastic
process describing its dynamical behavior is presented and analyzed. The notion
of plasticity kernel is introduced as a key component of plastic neural
networks models, generalizing a notion used for pair-based models. We show that
a large number of STDP rules from neuroscience and physics can be represented

For example, to pour and serve a drink, a robot should be able to recognize
novel containers which afford the task. Most importantly, robots should be able
to manipulate these novel containers to fulfill the task. To achieve this, we
aim to provide robust and generalized perception of object affordances and
their associated manipulation poses for reliable manipulation. In this work, we
combine the notions of affordance and category-level pose, and introduce the
Affordance Coordinate Frame (ACF). With ACF, we represent each object class in
terms of individual affordance parts and the compatibility between them, where
each part is associated with a part category-level pose for robot manipulation.
In our experiments, we demonstrate that ACF outperforms state-of-the-art
methods for object detection, as well as category-level pose estimation for
object parts. We further demonstrate the applicability of ACF to robot
manipulation tasks through experiments in a simulated environment.

coupled to a scalar field in a cavity. It has been realized that an accelerated
detector will experience a thermal bath, which is termed the Unruh effect. We
examine the similarities and differences for quantum correlations regarding
either temperature or acceleration. As the accelerations (resp. temperatures)
of the detectors increase, the entanglement decreases to zero at some instant
but the mutual information (resp. discord) can be amplified. As the
accelerations increase but are in opposite directions, the quantum correlations
decay. Importantly, we also reveal that larger quantum correlations can appear
in certain nonequilibrium scenarios in which either the acceleration difference
or the coupling difference becomes significant.

expansion velocity, with an instantaneous chemical reaction. The solution is
supposed to be self-similar and the flow is split in three zones: an inner zone
composed of burnt gases at rest, an intermediate zone where the solution is
regular and the initial atmosphere composed of fresh gases at rest. The
intermediate zone is bounded by the reactive shock (inner side) and the
so-called precursor shock (outer side), for which Rankine-Hugoniot conditions

equations which are solved numerically. We show that, for any admissible
precursor shock speed, the construction combining this numerical resolution
with the exploitation of jump conditions is unique, and yields decreasing
pressure, density and velocity profiles in the intermediate zone. In addition,
the reactive shock speed is larger than the velocity on the outer side of the
shock, which is consistent with the fact that the difference of these two
quantities is the so-called flame velocity, i.e. the (relative) velocity at
which the chemical reaction progresses in the fresh gases. Finally, we also
observe numerically that the function giving the flame velocity as a function
of the precursor shock speed is increasing; this allows to embed the resolution
in a Newton-like procedure to compute the flow for a given flame speed (instead
of for a given precursor shock speed). The resulting numerical algorithm is

points (e.g., edge and plane) make the exact point matching impossible. In this
paper, we formulate the lidar BA as minimizing the distance from a feature
point to its matched edge or plane. Unlike the visual SLAM (and prior plane
adjustment method in lidar SLAM) where the feature has to be co-determined
along with the pose, we show that the feature can be analytically solved and
removed from the BA, the resultant BA is only dependent on the scan poses. This
greatly reduces the optimization scale and allows large-scale dense plane and
edge features to be used. To speedup the optimization, we derive the analytical
derivatives of the cost function, up to second order, in closed form. Moreover,
we propose a novel adaptive voxelization method to search feature
correspondence efficiently. The proposed formulations are incorporated into a

intentionally established at non-zero speed mimicking human manipulation
abilities in dynamic grasping and pushing of objects. Starting from the
recorded dynamic response of a 7DOF torque-controlled robot that intentionally
impacts a rigid surface, we investigate the possibility and accuracy of
predicting the post-impact robot velocity from the pre-impact velocity and
impact configuration. The velocity prediction is obtained by means of an impact
map, derived using the framework of nonsmooth mechanics, that makes use of the
known rigid-body robot model and the assumption of a frictionless inelastic
impact.The main contribution is proposing a methodology that allows for a
meaningful quantitative comparison between the recorded post-impact data, that
exhibits a damped oscillatory response after the impact, and the post-impact
velocity prediction derived via the readily available rigid-body robot model,
that presents no oscillations and that is the one typically obtained via
mainstream robot simulator software. The results of this new approach are
promising in terms of prediction accuracy and thus relevant for the growing
field of impact-aware robot control. The recorded impact data (18 experiments)
is made publicly available, together with the numerical routines employed to
generate the quantitative comparison, to further stimulate interest/research in
this field.

each holding a $d$-dimensional function $f_i$, aim to jointly minimise the sum
of the functions $\sum_{i = 1}^N f_i (x)$. This problem arises naturally in
large-scale distributed optimisation, where a standard solution is to apply
variants of (stochastic) gradient descent. We focus on the communication
complexity of this problem: our main result provides the first fully
unconditional bounds on total number of bits which need to be sent and received
by the $N$ machines to solve this problem under point-to-point communication,
within a given error-tolerance. Specifically, we show that $\Omega( Nd \log d /
N\varepsilon)$ total bits need to be communicated between the machines to find
an additive $\epsilon$-approximation to the minimum of $\sum_{i = 1}^N f_i

importantly, requires no assumptions on the algorithm structure. The lower
bound is tight under certain restrictions on parameter values, and is matched
within constant factors for quadratic objectives by a new variant of quantised
gradient descent, which we describe and analyse. Our results bring over tools
from communication complexity to distributed optimisation, which has potential

missed in optical, UV and soft X-ray observations since they could be obscured
by gas and dust. A mid-infrared (mid-IR) survey supported by multiwavelength
data is one of the best ways to find obscured AGN activities because it suffers
less from extinction. Previous large IR photometric surveys, e.g., $WISE$ and
$Spitzer$, have gaps between the mid-IR filters. Therefore, star forming galaxy
(SFG)-AGN diagnostics in the mid-IR were limited. The $AKARI$ satellite has a
unique continuous 9-band filter coverage in the near to mid-IR wavelengths. In
this work, we take advantage of the state-of-the-art spectral energy

126 AGNs in the NEP-Wide field with this method. We also investigate the energy
released from the AGN as a fraction of the total IR luminosity of a galaxy. We
found that the AGN contribution is larger at higher redshifts for a given IR

We further show upper bounds that are tight for two large classes of functions:

metric of data privacy that prevents the inference of personal data from
obfuscated data in the local model. However, there are scenarios in which the
adversary wants to perform re-identification attacks to link the obfuscated
data to users in this model. LDP can cause excessive obfuscation and destroy
the utility in these scenarios because it is not designed to directly prevent
re-identification. In this paper, we propose a measure of re-identification
risks, which we call PIE (Personal Information Entropy). The PIE is designed so
that it directly prevents re-identification attacks in the local model. It
lower-bounds the lowest possible re-identification error probability (i.e.,
Bayes error probability) of the adversary. We analyze the relation between LDP
and the PIE, and analyze the PIE and utility in distribution estimation for two
obfuscation mechanisms providing LDP. Through experiments, we show that when we
consider re-identification as a privacy risk, LDP can cause excessive
obfuscation and destroy the utility. Then we show that the PIE can be used to
guarantee low re-identification risks for the local obfuscation mechanisms
while keeping high utility.

that $f$ has a topological attractor with a positive Lyapunov exponent. First,
$\Omega_{\rm trap} \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is trapping region for $f$. Second,
${\bf W}$ is a finite set of words that encodes the forward orbits of all
points in $\Omega_{\rm trap}$. Finally, $C \subset T \mathbb{R}^N$ is an
invariant expanding cone for derivatives of compositions of $f$ formed by the
words in ${\bf W}$. We develop an algorithm that identifies these objects for
two-dimensional homeomorphisms comprised of two affine pieces. The main effort
is in the explicit construction of $\Omega_{\rm trap}$ and $C$. Their existence
is equated to a set of computable conditions in a general way. This results in
a computer-assisted proof of chaos throughout a relatively large regime of
parameter space. We also observe how the failure of $C$ to be expanding can
coincide with a bifurcation of $f$. Lyapunov exponents are evaluated using
one-sided directional derivatives so that forward orbits that intersect a

we formulate the weighted likelihood function of auxiliary tasks as a surrogate
prior for the main task. By adjusting the auxiliary task weights to minimize
the divergence between the surrogate prior and the true prior of the main task,
we obtain a more accurate prior estimation, achieving the goal of minimizing
the required amount of training data for the main task and avoiding a costly
grid search. In multiple experimental settings (e.g. semi-supervised learning,
multi-label classification), we demonstrate that our algorithm can effectively
utilize limited labeled data of the main task with the benefit of auxiliary

problem in the standard model. Our study starts from a naturally Hermitian
${\bf M^2}\equiv M^q \cdot M^{q\dagger}$ rather than the previously assumed
Hermitian $M^q$. The only assumption employed here is that the real part and
imaginary part of $\bf M^2$ can be, respectively, diagonalized by a common $\bf
U^q$ matrix. Such an assumption leads to a $\bf M^2$ pattern which depends on
only five parameters and can be diagonalized analytically by a $\bf U^q$ matrix
which depends on only two of the parameters. Two of the derived mass
eigenvalues are predicted degenerate if one of the parameters $\bf C ~(C')$ in
up- (down-) quark sector is zero. As the $\bf U^q$ patterns are obtained,
thirty-six $V_{CKM}$ candidates are yielded and only eight of them, classified
into two groups, fit empirical data within the order of $O(\lambda)$. One of
the groups is further excluded in a numerical test, and the surviving group
predicts that the degenerate pair in a quark type are the lightest and the
heaviest generations rather than the lighter two generations assumed in
previous researches. However, there is still one unsatisfactory prediction in
this research, a quadruple equality in which four CKM elements of very
different values are predicted to be equal. It indicates the $\bf M^2$ pattern
studied here is still oversimplified by that employed assumption and the
ultimate solution can only be obtained by diagonalizing the unsimplified $\bf
M^2$ matrix containing nine parameters directly. The $V_{CKM}$ presented here
is already very close to such an ultimate CPV solution.

profile is often obtained after annealing, resulting in a bilayered or
double-layered absorber. So far, only segregated pieces of research exist to
characterize this double layer, its formation dynamics and its effect on the
performance of devices. Here, we review the existing research on double-layered
kesterites and evaluate the different mechanisms proposed. Using a
cosputtering-based approach, we show that the two layers can differ
significantly in morphology, composition and optoelectronic properties, and
complement the results with a statistical dataset of over 850 individual CZTS
solar cells. By reducing the absorber thickness from above 1000 nm to 300 nm,
we show that the double layer segregation is alleviated. In turn, we see a
progressive improvement in the device performance for lower thickness, which
alone would be inconsistent with the known case of ultrathin CIGS solar cells.
By comparing the results with CZTS grown on monocrystalline Si substrates,
without a native Na supply, we show that the alkali metal supply does not
determine the double layer formation, but merely reduces the threshold for its
occurrence. Instead, we propose that the main formation mechanism is the early
migration of Cu to the surface during annealing and formation of Cu2-xS phases,
in a self-regulating process akin to the Kirkendall effect. We comment on the
generality of the mechanism proposed, comparing our results to other synthesis
routes, including our own in-house results from solution processing and pulsed
laser deposition of sulfide and oxide-based targets. Although the double layer
occurrence largely depends on the kesterite synthesis route, the common factors
determining the double layer occurrence appear to be the presence of metallic
Cu and/or a chalcogen deficiency in the precursor matrix.

contain a submatrix that can be turned into $P$ by changing some $1$ entries to
$0$ entries, and changing an arbitrary $0$ to $1$ in $M$ introduces such a
submatrix in $M$. In saturation problems for $0$-$1$ matrices we are interested
in estimating the minimum number of $1$ entries in an $m \times n$ matrix that
is saturating for $P$, in terms of $m$ and $n$.
  In other words, we wish to give good estimates for the saturation function of
$P$. Recently, Brualdi and Cao initiated the study of saturation problems in
the context of $0$-$1$ matrices.
  We extend their work in several directions. We prove that every $0$-$1$
forbidden matrix has its saturation function either in $\Theta(1)$ or
$\Theta(n)$ in the case when we restrict ourselves to square saturating
matrices. Then we give a partial answer to a question posed by Brualdi and Cao
about the saturation function of $J_k$, which is obtained from the identity
matrix $I_k$ by putting the first row after the last row. Furthermore, we
exhibit a $5\times 5$ permutation matrix with the saturation function bounded
from the above by a fixed constant. We complement this result by identifying
large classes of $0$-$1$ matrices with linear saturation function. Finally, we
completely resolve the related semisaturation problem as far as the constant
vs. linear dichotomy is concerned.

adaptive-mesh refinement general-relativistic $N$-body code GRAMSES. We study
the generation of vorticity in the dark matter velocity field at low redshift,
providing fits to the shape and evolution of its power spectrum over a range of
scales. By analysing the gravitomagnetic vector potential, which is absent in
Newtonian simulations, in dark matter haloes with masses ranging from
$\sim10^{12.5}~h^{-1}{M}_{\odot}$ to $\sim10^{15}~h^{-1}{M}_{\odot}$, we find
that its magnitude correlates with the halo mass, peaking in the inner regions.
Nevertheless, on average, its ratio against the scalar gravitational potential
remains fairly constant, below percent level, decreasing roughly linearly with
redshift and showing a weak dependence on halo mass. Furthermore, we show that
the gravitomagnetic acceleration in haloes peaks towards the core and reaches
almost $10^{-10}$ $h$ cm/s$^2$ in the most massive halo of the simulation.
However, regardless of the halo mass, the ratio between the magnitudes of the
gravitomagnetic force and the standard gravitational force is typically at
around the $10^{-5}$ level inside the haloes, again without significant radius
dependence. This result confirms that the gravitomagnetic effects have a
negligible impact on structure formation, even for the most massive structures,
although its behaviour in low density regions remains to be explored. Likewise,
the impact on observations remains to be understood in the future.

significant body of work on session types has neglected the imperative approach

early work on imperative session types by exhibiting a typing and semantics
preserving translation into a system of linear functional session types. We
further show that the untyped backwards translation from the functional to the
imperative calculus is semantics preserving. We restrict the type system of the

lattice theta functions as building blocks. We first derive asymptotic and
numerical results showing the (non-)maximality of the triangular lattice with

representations which contain both a language-encoding component and an
abstract, cross-lingual component, and explicitly identify an empirical

learning applications, e.g., to supplement existing datasets that are small.
Whilst, as the increasing use of machine learning models in security-critical
applications, the embedding and extraction of malicious knowledge are
equivalent to the notorious backdoor attack and its defence, respectively. This
paper studies the embedding and extraction of knowledge in tree ensemble
classifiers, and focuses on knowledge expressible with a generic form of
Boolean formulas, e.g., robustness properties and backdoor attacks. For the
embedding, it is required to be preservative(the original performance of the
classifier is preserved), verifiable(the knowledge can be attested), and
stealthy(the embedding cannot be easily detected). To facilitate this, we
propose two novel, and effective, embedding algorithms, one of which is for
black-box settings and the other for white-box settings.The embedding can be
done in PTIME. Beyond the embedding, we develop an algorithm to extract the
embedded knowledge, by reducing the problem to be solvable with an SMT
(satisfiability modulo theories) solver. While this novel algorithm can
successfully extract knowledge, the reduction leads to an NP computation.
Therefore, if applying embedding as backdoor attacks and extraction as defence,
our results suggest a complexity gap (P vs. NP) between the attack and defence
when working with tree ensemble classifiers. We apply our algorithms toa
diverse set of datasets to validate our conclusion extensively.

realm of non-linear optics, a field developed in laser physics. A classical
non-linear effect is self-modulation. We examine the propagation of FRBs
through the circumburst environment using the idealised setup of a
monochromatic linearly-polarised GHz wave propagating through a uniform plasma
slab of density $N$ at distance $R$ from the source. We find that
self-modulation occurs if the slab is located within a critical radius $R_{\rm
crit}\sim 10^{17}(N/10^2{\rm\; cm}^{-3})(L/10^{42}{\rm\; erg\; s}^{-1}){\rm\;
cm}$, where $L$ is the isotropic equivalent of the FRB luminosity.
Self-modulation breaks the burst into pancakes transverse to the radial
direction. When $R\lesssim R_{\rm crit}$, the transverse size of the pancakes
is smaller than the Fresnel scale. The pancakes are strongly diffracted as the
burst exits the slab, and interference between the pancakes produces a
frequency modulation of the observed intensity with a sub-GHz bandwidth. When
$R\sim R_{\rm crit}$, the transverse size of the pancakes becomes comparable
with the Fresnel scale, and the effect of diffraction is weaker. The observed
intensity is modulated on a timescale of ten microseconds, which corresponds to
the radial width of the pancakes. Our results suggest that self-modulation may
cause the temporal and frequency structure observed in FRBs.

state of the art, which traditionally focuses on univariate measurements,
Net-GAN detects anomalies in multivariate time-series, exploiting temporal
dependencies through RNNs. Net-GAN discovers the underlying distribution of the
baseline, multivariate data, without making any assumptions on its nature,
offering a powerful approach to detect anomalies in complex, difficult to model
network monitoring data. We further exploit the concepts behind generative
models to conceive Net-VAE, a complementary approach to Net-GAN for network
anomaly detection, based on variational auto-encoders (VAE). We evaluate
Net-GAN and Net-VAE in different monitoring scenarios, including anomaly
detection in IoT sensor data, and intrusion detection in network measurements.
Generative models represent a promising approach for network anomaly detection,
especially when considering the complexity and ever-growing number of
time-series to monitor in operational networks.

trees. Parys (2019) has developed an ingenious quasi-polynomial McNaughton-
Zielonka-style algorithm, and Lehtinen et al. (2019) have improved its
worst-case runtime. Jurdzi\'nski and Morvan (2020) have recently brought
forward a generic attractor-based algorithm, formalizing a second class of
quasi-polynomial solutions to solving parity games, which have runtime
quadratic in the size of universal trees. First, we adapt the framework of
iterative lifting algorithms to computing attractor-based strategies. Second,
we design a symmetric lifting algorithm in this setting, in which two lifting
iterations, one for each player, accelerate each other in a recursive fashion.
The symmetric algorithm performs at least as well as progress-measure liftings
in the worst-case, whilst bypassing their inherent asymmetric limitation.
Thirdly, we argue that the behaviour of the generic attractor-based algorithm
of Jurdzinski and Morvan (2020) can be reproduced by a specific deceleration of
our symmetric lifting algorithm, in which some of the information collected by
the algorithm is repeatedly discarded. This yields a novel interpretation of
McNaughton-Zielonka-style algorithms as progress-measure lifting iterations
(with deliberate set-backs), further strengthening the ties between all known
quasi-polynomial algorithms to date.

accurate pixel-wise labeling which requires large amounts of human effort. The
human-in-the-loop method reduces labeling effort; however, it requires human
intervention for each image. This paper describes a general iterative training
methodology for semantic segmentation, Automating-the-Loop. This aims to
replicate the manual adjustments of the human-in-the-loop method with an
automated process, hence, drastically reducing labeling effort. Using the
application of detecting partially occluded apple tree segmentation, we compare
manually labeled annotations, self-training, human-in-the-loop, and
Automating-the-Loop methods in both the quality of the trained convolutional
neural networks, and the effort needed to create them. The convolutional neural
network (U-Net) performance is analyzed using traditional metrics and a new
metric, Complete Grid Scan, which promotes connectivity and low noise. It is
shown that in our application, the new Automating-the-Loop method greatly
reduces the labeling effort while producing comparable performance to both

clusters near the wall which can change large-scale flow structures. To gain
insights into clustering mechanisms, we study the interaction of a pair of
spherical bubbles rising in a vertical channel through combined experiments and
modeling. Experimental imaging identifies that pairwise bubbles of 1.0 mm
diameter take two preferred configurations depending on their mutual distance:
side-by-side positions for a short distance ($S<5$) and nearly inline, oblique
positions for a long distance ($S>5$), where $S$ is the mutual distance
normalized by the bubble radius. In the model, we formulate the motions of
pairwise bubbles rising at $Re=O(100)$. Analytical drag and lift, and
semi-empirical, spatio-temporal stochastic forcing are employed to represent
the mean acceleration and the fluctuation due to turbulent agitation,
respectively. The model is validated against the experiment through comparing
Lagrangian statistics of the bubbles. Simulations using this model identify two
distinct timescales of interaction dynamics which elucidate the preferred
configurations. For pairs initially in-line, the trailing bubble rapidly
escapes from the viscous wake of the leading bubble to take the oblique
position. Outside of the wake, the trailing bubble travels on a curve-line path
with a slower velocity driven by potential interaction and horizontally
approaches the leading bubble to become side-by-side. Moreover, statistical
analysis identifies that the combination of the wake and the agitation can
significantly accelerate the side-by-side clustering of in-line pairs. These
results indicate positive contributions of liquid viscosity and turbulence to
the formation of bubble clusters.

medical knowledge. Then, a mathematical object walks along the KG. It starts
walking at a patient entity, which connects the KG based on the patient current
diseases or risk factors and stops at a disease entity, which represents the
predicted disease. The trajectory generated by the object represents an
interpretable disease progression path of the given patient. The dynamics of
the object are controlled by a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) module,
which is trained by electronic health records (EHRs). Experiments: We utilized
two real-world EHR datasets to evaluate the performance of our model. In the
disease prediction task, our model achieves 0.743 and 0.639 in terms of macro
area under the curve (AUC) in predicting 53 circulation system diseases in the
two datasets, respectively. This performance is comparable to the commonly used

focus on learning-enabled state estimation systems (LE-SESs), which have been
widely used in robotics applications to determine the current state (e.g.,
location, speed, direction, etc.) of a complex system. The LE-SESs are
networked systems composed of a set of connected components including Bayes
filters for localisation, and neural networks for processing sensory input. We
study LE-SESs from the perspective of formal verification, which determines the
satisfiability of a system model against the specified properties. Over
LE-SESs, we investigate two key properties - robustness and resilience - and
provide their formal definitions. To enable formal verification, we reduce the
LE-SESs to a novel class of labelled transition systems, named {PO}2-LTS in the
paper, and formally express the properties as constrained optimisation
objectives. We prove that the robustness verification is NP-complete. Based on
{PO}2-LTS and the optimisation objectives, practical verification algorithms
are developed to check the satisfiability of the properties on the LE-SESs. As
a major case study, we interrogate a real-world dynamic tracking system which
uses a single Kalman Filter (KF) - a special case of Bayes filter - to localise

neural networks, processes a high-resolution Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI)

the properties of the WAMI tracking system but also provide representative
examples, the latter of which inspired us to take an enhanced LE-SESs design

organic light-emitting diode (OLED) become polarized so that recombination
preferentially forms molecular triplet excited-state species. For low device
currents, magnetoelectroluminescence (MEL) perfectly follows Boltzmann
activation, implying a virtually complete polarization outcome. As the current
increases, the MEL effect is reduced because spin polarization is suppressed by
the reduction in carrier residence time within the device. Under these
conditions, an additional field-dependent process affecting the spin-dependent
recombination emerges, which appears to relate to the build-up of triplet
excitons and the interaction with free charge carriers. Suppression of the EL
at high fields on its own does not, strictly, prove electronic spin
polarization. We therefore probe changes in the spin statistics of
recombination directly in a dual singlettriplet emitting OLED, which shows a
concomitant rise in phosphorescence intensity as fluorescence is suppressed.
Finite spin-orbit coupling in these materials gives rise to a microscopic
distribution in effective g factors of electrons and holes, $\Delta g$, i.e. a
distribution in Larmor frequencies, leading to singlet-triplet mixing within
the electronhole pair as a function of applied field. This $\Delta g$ effect in
the pair further suppresses singlet-exciton formation in addition to thermal
spin polarization of the individual carriers. Since the $\Delta g$ process

for subtracting background contributions from a high-pressure cell by taking
displacements of the cell parts into account, and found a way of resolving tiny
magnetism of a sample from given magnetometer response curves. A non-magnetic

  (Extended Version)","Extended version of short paper published at 4th International
  Workshop on Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain Technology - CBT 2020",,,,"cs.CR cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Payment channel networks are a highly discussed approach for improving
scalability of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. As they allow processing
transactions off-chain, payment channel networks are referred to as second
layer technology, while the blockchain is the first layer. We uncouple payment
channel networks from blockchains and look at them as first-class citizens.
This brings up the question what model payment channel networks require as
first layer. In response, we formalize a model (called RFL Model) for a first
layer below a payment channel network. While transactions are globally made
available by a blockchain, the RFL Model only provides the reduced property
that a transaction is delivered to the users being affected by a transaction.
We show that the reduced model's properties still suffice to implement payment
channels. By showing that the RFL Model can not only be instantiated by the
Bitcoin blockchain but also by trusted third parties like banks, we show that
the reduction widens the design space for the first layer. Further, we show
that the stronger property provided by blockchains allows for optimizations
that can be used to reduce the time for locking collateral during payments over
multiple hops in a payment channel network.

distribution families, many of which are studied in survival analysis. When
performing inference, lack of knowledge of the populational minimum becomes a
problem, which can be dealt with by making a good guess thereof, or by
handcrafting a grid of initial parameters that will be useful for that
particular problem. These solutions are fine when analyzing a single set of
samples, but it becomes unfeasible when there are multiple datasets and a
case-by-case analysis would be too time consuming. In this paper we propose
methods to deal with the populational minimum in algorithmic, efficient and/or
simple ways. Six methods are presented and analyzed, two of which have full
theoretical support, but lack simplicity. The other four are simple and have
some theoretical grounds in non-parametric results such as the law of iterated
logarithm, and they exhibited very good results when it comes to maximizing
likelihood and being able to recycle the grid of initial parameters among the
datasets. With our results, we hope to ease the inference process for
practitioners, and expect that these methods will eventually be included in
software packages themselves.

critical role in estimating the prior distribution of deep image encodings.
Existing methods combine hyperprior with local context in the entropy

of a global vision. In this work, we propose a novel Global Reference Model for
image compression to effectively leverage both the local and the global context
information, leading to an enhanced compression rate. The proposed method scans
decoded latents and then finds the most relevant latent to assist the
distribution estimating of the current latent. A by-product of this work is the
innovation of a mean-shifting GDN module that further improves the performance.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the

if and only if $\alpha \geq s_{p}:=(d-1)|\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{2}|$. We extend
this result to operators of the form $\mathcal{L} = -\sum \limits _{j=1} ^{d}

functions $a_{j}$ and $a_{j+d}$ only depend on $x_{j}$, are bounded above and
below, but are merely Lipschitz continuous. This is below the $C^{1,1}$
regularity that is known to be necessary in general for Strichartz estimates in
dimension $d \geq 2$. Our proof is based on an approach to the boundedness of
Fourier integral operators recently developed by Hassell, Rozendaal, and the
second author. We construct a scale of adapted Hardy spaces on which
$\exp(i\sqrt{ \mathcal{L}} )$ is bounded by lifting $L^{p}$ functions to the
tent space $T^{p,2}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$, using a wave packet transform adapted to
the Lipschitz metric induced by the coefficients $a_j$. The result then follows

in operation to evaluate the vibration immunity for automotive lidar
applications. The MEMS mirror has a reinforcement structure on the backside of
the mirror, causing vibration coupling by a mismatch between the center of mass
and the rotation axis. An analysis of energy variation is proposed, showing
direction dependency of vibration coupling. Vibration influences are evaluated
by transient vibration response and vibration frequency sweep using a single
tone vibration for translational y- and z- axis. The measurement results
demonstrate standard deviation (STD) amplitude and frequency errors are up to
1.64 % and 0.26 %, respectively, for 2 grms single tone vibrations on y axis.
The simulation results also show a good agreement with both measurements,
proving the proposed vibration coupling mechanism of the MEMS mirror. The
phased locked loop (PLL) improves the STD amplitude and frequency errors to
0.91 % and 0.15 % for y axis vibration, corresponding to 44.4 % and 43.0 %
reduction, respectively, showing the benefit of a controlled MEMS mirror for
reliable automotive MEMS lidars.

the nonlinear Hall response can be as large as $\sim$ 200{\AA}, exceeding the

cosmic ray ensembles (CRE): groups of a minimum of two CR with a common primary
interaction vertex or the same parent particle. The CREDO program embraces
testing known CR and CRE scenarios, and preparing to observe unexpected
physics, it is also suitable for multi-messenger and multi-mission
applications. Perfectly matched to CREDO capabilities, CRE could be formed both
within classical models (e.g. as products of photon-photon interactions), and
exotic scenarios (e.g. as results of decay of Super Heavy Dark Matter
particles). Their fronts might be significantly extended in space and time, and
they might include cosmic rays of energies spanning the whole cosmic ray energy
spectrum, with a footprint composed of at least two extensive air showers with
correlated arrival directions and arrival times. Since CRE are mostly expected
to be spread over large areas and, because of the expected wide energy range of
the contributing particles, CRE detection might only be feasible when using
available cosmic ray infrastructure collectively, i.e. as a globally extended
network of detectors. Thus, with this review article, the CREDO Collaboration
invites the astroparticle physics community to actively join or to contribute
to the research dedicated to CRE, and in particular to share any cosmic ray
data useful for the specific CRE detection strategies.

learning from demonstration (LfD) due to the nonnecessity of expert actions
when reconstructing the expert policy from the expert data. However, previous
studies imply that the performance of LfO is inferior to LfD by a tremendous
gap, which makes it challenging to employ LfO in practice. By contrast, this
paper proves that LfO is almost equivalent to LfD in the deterministic robot
environment, and more generally even in the robot environment with bounded
randomness. In the deterministic robot environment, from the perspective of the
control theory, we show that the inverse dynamics disagreement between LfO and
LfD approaches zero, meaning that LfO is almost equivalent to LfD. To further
relax the deterministic constraint and better adapt to the practical
environment, we consider bounded randomness in the robot environment and prove
that the optimizing targets for both LfD and LfO remain almost same in the more
generalized setting. Extensive experiments for multiple robot tasks are
conducted to empirically demonstrate that LfO achieves comparable performance
to LfD. In fact, most common robot systems in reality are the robot environment
with bounded randomness (i.e., the environment this paper considered). Hence,
our findings greatly extend the potential of LfO and suggest that we can safely
apply LfO without sacrificing the performance compared to LfD in practice.

However, deepening and widening 3D networks increases training difficulty

SR of medical volumetric data called ParallelNet using parallel connections. We
construct a parallel connection structure based on the group convolution and

larger receptive fields. In addition, to further improve accuracy, we present
an efficient version of ParallelNet (called VolumeNet), which reduces the
number of parameters and deepens ParallelNet using a proposed lightweight
building block module called the Queue module. Unlike most lightweight CNNs
based on depthwise convolutions, the Queue module is primarily constructed
using separable 2D cross-channel convolutions. As a result, the number of
network parameters and computational complexity can be reduced significantly

demonstrate that the proposed VolumeNet significantly reduces the number of

throughput but significantly smaller delay than loss-based one and is thus
ideal for these applications. However, when a delay- and a loss-based flow
compete for a bottleneck, the loss-based one can monopolize all the bandwidth
and starve the delay-based one. Fair queuing at the bottleneck link solves this
problem by assigning an equal share of the available bandwidth to each flow.
However, so far no end host based algorithm to detect fair queuing exists. Our
contribution is the development of an algorithm that detects fair queuing at
flow startup and chooses delay-based congestion control if there is fair

estimator, which is then used to analyse the TGSS-ADR1, WENSS, SUMSS, and NVSS
radio source catalogues, spreading over a decade of frequencies. The same
masking strategy is applied to all four surveys to produce comparable results.
In order to address the differences in the observed dipole amplitudes, we
cross-match the two surveys located at both ends of the analysed frequency
range. For the linear estimator, we identify a general bias in the estimated

dipole for skies with $10^7$ simulated sources is found to be below one degree

MeV})$, decay of neutron $n \to\chi \gamma$ induced by $\bar S_1$ is possible
at the loop level, while the proton remains stable. The branching ratio of such

agreement with the Borexino experiment bound. We comment on low-energy
processes with the nucleon-like mass of $\chi$ in the final state as $\Lambda

ONTRAMs are a special case of transformation models and trade off flexibility

do not require millions of object labels. Excitingly, recent algorithmic
advancements in self-supervised learning now enable convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) to learn useful visual object representations without
supervised labels, too. In the light of this recent breakthrough, we here
compare self-supervised networks to supervised models and human behaviour. We
tested models on 15 generalisation datasets for which large-scale human
behavioural data is available (130K highly controlled psychophysical trials).
Surprisingly, current self-supervised CNNs share four key characteristics of
their supervised counterparts: (1.) relatively poor noise robustness (with the
notable exception of SimCLR), (2.) non-human category-level error patterns,
(3.) non-human image-level error patterns (yet high similarity to supervised
model errors) and (4.) a bias towards texture. Taken together, these results
suggest that the strategies learned through today's supervised and
self-supervised training objectives end up being surprisingly similar, but
distant from human-like behaviour. That being said, we are clearly just at the
beginning of what could be called a self-supervised revolution of machine
vision, and we are hopeful that future self-supervised models behave
differently from supervised ones, and---perhaps---more similar to robust human
object recognition.

  Our approach is useful for the estimation of stochastic differential
equations in the parametric sparse setting. More precisely, under the high

and introduce a procedure for the selection of the tuning parameters.
Furthermore, the paper contains a simulation study as well as a real data

anticipate the UMR effect. The UMR provides a probe for chirality and band
flatness in the twisted bilayers.

  Workshop on Computational Diffusion MRI (CDMRI'20)",,,,"physics.med-ph eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) has recently seen a rising interest in
planar, spherical and general B-tensor encodings. Some of these sequences have
aided traditional linear encoding in the estimation of white matter
microstructural features, generally by making DW-MRI less sensitive to the
orientation of axon fascicles in a voxel. However, less is known about their
potential to make the signal more sensitive to fascicle orientation, especially
in crossing-fascicle voxels.
  Although planar encoding has been commended for the resemblance of its signal
with the voxel's orientation distribution function (ODF), linear encoding
remains the near undisputed method of choice for orientation estimation. This
paper presents a theoretical framework to gauge the sensitivity of axisymmetric
B-tensors to fascicle orientations. A signal peak separation index (SPSI) is
proposed, motivated by theoretical considerations on a simple multi-tensor
model of fascicle crossing. Theory and simulations confirm the intuition that
linear encoding, because it maximizes B-tensor anisotropy, possesses an
intrinsic advantage over all other axisymmetric B-tensors. At identical SPSI
however, oblate B-tensors yield higher signal and may be more robust to
acquisition noise than their prolate counterparts. The proposed index relates
the properties of the B-tensor to those of the tissue microstructure in a
straightforward way and can thus guide the design of diffusion sequences for
improved orientation estimation and tractography.

introduces uncertainty in the calculated position of an observed feature during
3-D mapping. It is typically assumed that pixels and scene features are points,
however, a pixel is a two-dimensional area that maps onto multiple points in
the scene. This uncertainty region is a bound for quantization error in the
calculated point positions. Earlier studies calculated the volume of two
intersecting pixel views, approximated as a cuboid, by projecting pyramids and
cones from the pixels into the scene. In this paper, we reverse this approach
by generating an array of scene points and calculating which scene points are
detected by which pixel in each camera. This enables us to map the uncertainty
regions for every pixel correspondence for a given camera system in one
calculation, without approximating the complex shapes. The dependence of the
volumes of the uncertainty regions on camera baseline length, focal length,
pixel size, and distance to object, shows that earlier studies overestimated
the quantization error by at least a factor of two. For static camera systems
the method can also be used to determine volumetric scene geometry without the
need to calculate disparity maps.

especially in 2D face recognition. However, the bottleneck of deep learning
based 3D face recognition is that it is difficult to collect millions of 3D
faces, whether for industry or academia. In view of this situation, there are
many methods to generate more 3D faces from existing 3D faces through 3D face
data augmentation, which are used to train deep 3D face recognition models.
However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no method to generate 3D faces
from 2D face images for training deep 3D face recognition models. This letter
focuses on the role of reconstructed 3D facial surfaces in 3D face
identification and proposes a framework of 2D-aided deep 3D face
identification. In particular, we propose to reconstruct millions of 3D face
scans from a large scale 2D face database (i.e.VGGFace2), using a deep learning
based 3D face reconstruction method (i.e.ExpNet). Then, we adopt a two-phase
training approach: In the first phase, we use millions of face images to
pre-train the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), and in the second
phase, we use normal component images (NCI) of reconstructed 3D face scans to
train the DCNN. Extensive experimental results illustrate that the proposed
approach can greatly improve the rank-1 score of 3D face identification on the
FRGC v2.0, the Bosphorus, and the BU-3DFE 3D face databases, compared to the
model trained by 2D face images. Finally, our proposed approach achieves
state-of-the-art rank-1 scores on the FRGC v2.0 (97.6%), Bosphorus (98.4%), and
BU-3DFE (98.8%) databases. The experimental results show that the reconstructed
3D facial surfaces are useful and our 2D-aided deep 3D face identification
framework is meaningful, facing the scarcity of 3D faces.

over 7 years with the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and its continuation, the
intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (iPTF). This is the first homogeneous

-17.71 +- 0.85 mag. To derive the explosion epochs, we fit the r-band
lightcurves to a template derived from a well-sampled light curve. We computed
the bolometric light curves using r and g band data, g-r colors and bolometric
corrections. Bolometric light curves and Fe II lambda 5169 velocities at peak

recent changes in urbanisation are across Europe and how it relates to city

use: has it been artificialised for human uses (residence or roads for
instance) or is it natural, or at least undeveloped? Using spatially detailed
data from the EU Copernicus Urban Atlas, profiles of artificial land use (ALU)
are calculated and compared between two years, 2006 and 2012. Based on the
homothety of urban forms found by Lemoy and Caruso (2018), a simple scaling law
is used to compare the internal structure of cities after controlling for
population size. We firstly show that when using the FUA definition of cities,
a kind of Gibrat's law for land use appears to hold. However, when we examine
cities internally, this is no longer clear as there are differences on average
between city size categories. We also look at further city groupings using
regions and topography to show that artificial land use growth across European
cities is not homogeneous. Our findings have important implications relative to
the sustainability of cities as this evidence is pointing towards increasing
urban sprawl and stagnant growth in urban centres across cities of all sizes.
It also has theoretical implications on the nature of sprawl and its scaling
with city size.

HST for the prototypical Type 2 AGN NGC1068, we implement the visualization of

results. Quite possibly, this is the outer extended part of the polar elongated
dusty material seen in the recent mid-IR interferometry at pc scale.
Conversely, the latter small-scale geometry is inferred to have a hollow-cone

based on Gaussian process (GP) surrogates. The method takes in noisily observed
option prices, fits a nonparametric input-output map and then analytically
differentiates the latter to obtain the various price sensitivities. Our
motivation is to compute Greeks in cases where direct computation is expensive,
such as in local volatility models, or can only ever be done approximately. We
provide a detailed analysis of numerous aspects of GP surrogates, including
choice of kernel family, simulation design, choice of trend function and impact
of noise.
  We further discuss the application to Delta hedging, including a new Lemma
that relates quality of the Delta approximation to discrete-time hedging loss.
Results are illustrated with two extensive case studies that consider
estimation of Delta, Theta and Gamma and benchmark approximation quality and
uncertainty quantification using a variety of statistical metrics. Among our
key take-aways are the recommendation to use Matern kernels, the benefit of
including virtual training points to capture boundary conditions, and the
significant loss of fidelity when training on stock-path-based datasets.

approach this problem by estimating the irreducible error of the underlying

issues in datasets used to train or evaluate ML model artifacts. We design a
practical Bayes error estimator that is compared against baseline feasibility
study candidates on 6 datasets (with additional real and synthetic noise of
different levels) in computer vision and natural language processing.
Furthermore, by including our systematic feasibility study with additional

weighted by their respective uncertainties, to obtain the most likely posterior
of a dynamical system. In variational data assimilation the posterior is
computed by solving a nonlinear least squares problem. Many numerical weather
prediction (NWP) centres use full observation error covariance (OEC) weighting
matrices, which can slow convergence of the data assimilation procedure.
Previous work revealed the importance of the minimum eigenvalue of the OEC
matrix for conditioning and convergence of the unpreconditioned data
assimilation problem. In this paper we examine the use of correlated OEC
matrices in the preconditioned data assimilation problem for the first time. We
consider the case where there are more state variables than observations, which
is typical for applications with sparse measurements e.g. NWP and remote
sensing. We find that similarly to the unpreconditioned problem, the minimum
eigenvalue of the OEC matrix appears in new bounds on the condition number of
the Hessian of the preconditioned objective function. Numerical experiments
reveal that the condition number of the Hessian is minimised when the
background and observation lengthscales are equal. This contrasts with the
unpreconditioned case, where decreasing the observation error lengthscale
always improves conditioning. Conjugate gradient experiments show that in this
framework the condition number of the Hessian is a good proxy for convergence.
Eigenvalue clustering explains cases where convergence is faster than expected.

described as the zero set of a signed-distance level-set function and

presented for its construction on a narrow-band. On the cut-cells a monolithic
elliptic extension velocity method is adapted and a fast-marching procedure on
the neighboring cells. The spatial discretization is based on a symmetric
interior penalty method and for the temporal discretization a moving interface
approach is adapted. A cell agglomeration technique is utilized for handling
small cut-cells and topology changes during the interface motion. The method is
validated against a wide range of typical two-phase surface tension driven flow

to our approach is to generate adversarial examples that expose the weakness of

this can be accomplished for the Adwords problem. We use this framework to
co-train an algorithm network and an adversarial network against each other

adversarial examples that are consistent with known optimal results. Secondly,
we address the question of robustness of the algorithm, namely can we design
algorithms that are both strong under practical distributions, as well as
exhibit robust performance against adversarial instances. To accomplish this,
we train algorithm networks using a mixture of adversarial and practical
distributions like power-laws; the resulting networks exhibit a smooth

  We present an algebraic algorithmic framework based on constrained

cross-lingual word embeddings -- maps of matching words across languages --
without supervision. Despite these successes, GANs' performance for the
difficult case of distant languages is still not satisfactory. These
limitations have been explained by GANs' incorrect assumption that source and
target embedding spaces are related by a single linear mapping and are
approximately isomorphic. We assume instead that, especially across distant
languages, the mapping is only piece-wise linear, and propose a
multi-adversarial learning method. This novel method induces the seed
cross-lingual dictionary through multiple mappings, each induced to fit the
mapping for one subspace. Our experiments on unsupervised bilingual lexicon
induction show that this method improves performance over previous
single-mapping methods, especially for distant languages.

azimuthal variations of amplitude. We restrict our investigation to a single
set of vertical, circular, and flat cavities aligned along a horizontal axis.
Such cracks are embedded in either isotropic surroundings or transversely
isotropic background with a vertical symmetry axis. We employ the effective
medium theory to obtain either transversely-isotropic material with a
horizontal symmetry axis or an orthotropic medium, respectively. To consider
the amplitudes, we focus on a Vavrycuk-Psencik approximation of the PP-wave
reflection coefficient. We assume that cracks are situated in one of the
halfspaces being in welded contact. Azimuthal variations depend on the
background stiffnesses, incidence angle, and crack density parameter. Upon
analytical analysis, we indicate which factors (such as background's
saturation) cause the reflection coefficient to have maximum absolute value in
the direction parallel or perpendicular to cracks. We discuss the irregular
cases, where such extreme values appear in the other than the aforementioned
directions. Due to the support of numerical simulations, we propose graphic
patterns of two-dimensional amplitude variations with azimuth. The patterns
consist of a series of shapes that change with the increasing value of the
crack density parameter. Schemes appear to differ depending on the incidence
angle and the saturation. Finally, we extract these shapes that are
characteristic of gas-bearing rocks. They may be treated as gas indicators. We
support the findings and verify our patterns using real values of stiffnesses
extracted from the sedimentary rocks' samples.

maximize an expected cumulative reward in a Markov decision process with
unknown transition probabilities. In this paper we consider the problem of
finding optimal policies assuming that they belong to a reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS). To that end we compute unbiased stochastic gradients of
the value function which we use as ascent directions to update the policy. A
major drawback of policy gradient-type algorithms is that they are limited to
episodic tasks unless stationarity assumptions are imposed. Hence preventing
these algorithms to be fully implemented online, which is a desirable property
for systems that need to adapt to new tasks and/or environments in deployment.
The main requirement for a policy gradient algorithm to work is that the
estimate of the gradient at any point in time is an ascent direction for the
initial value function. In this work we establish that indeed this is the case
which enables to show the convergence of the online algorithm to the critical
points of the initial value function. A numerical example shows the ability of
our online algorithm to learn to solve a navigation and surveillance problem,
in which an agent must loop between to goal locations. This example
corroborates our theoretical findings about the ascent directions of subsequent
stochastic gradients. It also shows how the agent running our online algorithm
succeeds in learning to navigate, following a continuing cyclic trajectory that
does not comply with the standard stationarity assumptions in the literature
for non episodic training.

plasma actuators that utilize a high-voltage pulse of nanosecond duration
between two surface-mounted electrodes to create an electrical breakdown of
air, along with rapid heating. These actuators usually produce multiple
filaments when operated at high pulse frequencies, and the rapid heating leads
to the formation of shock waves and complex flow fields. In this work we
replicate a single filament of the ns-SDBDs and characterize the induced flow
using velocity measurements from particle image velocimetry and density
measurements from background-oriented schlieren. The discharge is produced by a
high voltage electrical pulse between two copper electrodes on an acrylic base.
A hot gas kernel characterizes the flow field formed close to the electrodes
that expands and cools over time and a vortex ring that propagates away from
the surface while entraining cold ambient fluid. The gas density deficit inside
the kernel displays a power-law decay over time. Based on the observations, we
develop a simplified theoretical model based on vortex-driven cooling and
perform a scaling analysis to obtain the induced flow length and time scales.
The results show that the cooling process's time scales correspond to a
circulation-based time scale of the vortex ring, and the length scale of the
kernel corresponds to the vortex ring radius. These findings can guide the
choice of optimal filament spacing and pulse frequencies in the design,
deployment, and operation of nanosecond surface dielectric barrier discharges

each plant is preserved for all admissible data loss signals. Second, given the
open-loop and closed-loop dynamics of the plants, relevant parameters of the

non-existence of a stabilizing periodic scheduling sequence with the given

literature, we explore evolutionary and nucleosynthetic trends with wind
prescriptions and with initial metallicity. We compare our results to
observations of CEMP-s stars belonging to the Halo. The yields of
intermediate-mass EMP stars reflect the effects of very deep second dredge-up
(for the most massive models), superimposed with the combined signatures of
hot-bottom burning and third dredge-up. We confirm the reported trend that
models with initial metallicity Z$_{ini}$ <= 0.001 give positive yields of
$^{12}C, ^{15}N, ^{16}O$, and $^{26}Mg$. The $^{20}Ne, ^{21}Ne$, and $^{24}Mg$

positive for Z=$10^{-5}$. The results using two different prescriptions for
mass-loss rates differ widely in terms of the duration of the thermally-pulsing

a procedure to generate and automatically inject synthetic attacks in an

perception of full-duplex (FD) cooperative relaying in support of upcoming

automatic repeat request (HARQ) mechanism to ultra-reliable and low-latency
communication (URLLC). Indeed, the HARQ roundtrip time (RTT) is known to
include basic physical delays that may cause the HARQ abandonment for the 1 ms
latency use case of URLLC. Taking up these challenges, this article proposes a
hybrid FD amplify-and-forward (AF)-selective decode-and-forward (SDF)
relay-based system for URLLC. Over this build system, two HARQ procedures
within which the HARQ RTT is shortened, are suggested to face latency and
reliability issues, namely, the conventional and the enhanced HARQ procedures.
We develop then an analytical framework of this relay based HARQ system within
its different procedures. Finally, using Monte-Carlo simulations, we confirm
the theoretical results and compare the proposed relay-assisted HARQ procedures

most existing studies falls well below a few hundred, leaving questions open
about the reliability of findings on the relations between mobile sensing
signals and human outcomes. To address these limitations, we developed a home
environment sensor kit for continuous indoor air quality tracking and deployed
it in conjunction with established mobile sensing and experience sampling

TmCu$_3$Ch$_4$ are reinvestigated through considering these parameters, and
significant discrepancies are found. The ZT of p-type TaCu$_3$Te$_4$ can reach
~3 at 1000K among these compounds due to its low lattice thermal conductivity

reduced to 0.17 W m-1 K-1 through 1 GPa pressure while the power factor is
slightly improved due to bandgap reduction, leading to an extraordinary ZT~5.5
at 1000K. Although the substitution of Se causes a slight reduction of
$\kappa_l$ to ~0.3 W m-1 K-1, the power factor is reduced significantly due to
the dramatic reduction of DOS near Fermi level, which leads to lower the
Seebeck coefficient largely and increase electrical conductivity slightly.

with rigor and operated efficiently, the same does not generally hold for
developing countries due to inadequate planning, design, and operations of
their transportation systems. Because of inherent differences between internal
infrastructures, the systems deployed in developed countries may not be
amenable to developing ones. Besides, the traffic systems of developing
countries are not well-studied in the literature to the best of our knowledge.
For example, it is yet to explore how a developed country's lane-based traffic
flow would perform in the context of a developing country, which generally
experiences non-lane-based traffic. As such, by using our newly developed
traffic simulator 'RoadBird', we investigate outcomes of both lane-based and
non-lane-based traffic from the contexts of both developing and developed
countries. To do so, we run simulations over real road topologies (extracted
from the GIS maps of major cities such as Dhaka, Miami, and Riyadh) considering
different scenarios such as lane-based or non-lane-based flows, homogeneous or
heterogeneous traffic, with or without pedestrians, etc. We also incorporate
different car-following and lane-changing models to mimic traffic behaviors and
investigate their performances. While the lane changing dilemma remains an open
research question, our experimental evidences indicate: (i) lane-based
approaches will not necessarily perform better in the case of currently-adopted
non-lane-based scenarios; and (ii) non-lane-based strategies may benefit system
performance in lane-based scenarios while having heavy mixed traffic.
Nonetheless, we reveal several new insights for on-road experiences both in
developing and developed countries.

importance to psychology as a science, guiding theory development and
underlying the application of evidence-based intervention and decision-making.
Recent years, however, have seen growing awareness of serious problems with
NHST as it is typically used; this awareness has led to proposals to limit the
use of NHST techniques, to abandon these techniques and move to alternative
statistical approaches, or even to ban the use of NHST entirely. These
proposals are premature, because the observed problems with NHST arise as a
consequence of an historically contingent, essentially unmotivated, and
fundamentally incorrect, choice: that of NHST testing against point-form null
hypotheses. Using simple counting experiments we give a detailed presentation
of an alternative, more general approach: that of testing against
distributional nulls. We show that this distributional approach is
well-motivated mathematically, practically and experimentally, and that the use
of distributional nulls addresses various problems with the standard point-form
NHST approach, avoiding issues to do with sample size and allowing a coherent
estimation of the probability of replication of a given experimental result.
Rather than abandoning NHST, we should use the NHST approach in its most
general form, with distributional rather than point-form null hypotheses.

approaches are becoming popular in the literature to detect energy theft in the
advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). However, as neural networks are shown
to be vulnerable to adversarial examples, the security of the DL models is of
concern.
  In this work, we study the vulnerabilities of DL-based energy theft detection
through adversarial attacks, including single-step attacks and iterative
attacks. From the attacker's point of view, we design the
\textit{SearchFromFree} framework that consists of 1) a randomly adversarial
measurement initialization approach to maximize the stolen profit and 2) a
step-size searching scheme to increase the performance of black-box iterative
attacks. The evaluation based on three types of neural networks shows that the
adversarial attacker can report extremely low consumption measurements to the
utility without being detected by the DL models. We finally discuss the
potential defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks in energy theft
detection.

the Boltzmann-Gibbs factor which describes the thermal equilibrium of
short-range-interacting many-body Hamiltonian systems, the velocity
distribution of which is Maxwellian. It is generically applicable to systems
satisfying the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). When we focus instead on stationary
states of typical complex systems (e.g., classical long-range-interacting
many-body Hamiltonian systems, such as self-gravitating ones), the CLT, and
possibly also the LDT, need to be generalised. Specifically, when the
$N\to\infty$ attractor ($N$ being the number of degrees of freedom) in the
space of distributions is a $Q$-Gaussian (a nonadditive $q$-entropy-based
generalisation of the standard Gaussian case, which is recovered for $Q=1$)
related to a $Q$-generalised CLT, we expect the LDT probability distribution to
asymptotically approach a power law. Consistently with available strong
numerical indications for probabilistic models, this behaviour possibly is that
associated to a $q$-exponential (defined as
$e_q^x\equiv\left[1+(1-q)x\right]^{1/(1-q)}$, which is the generalisation of
the standard exponential form, straightforwardly recovered for $q=1$); $q$ and
$Q$ are expected to be simply connected, including the particular case $q=Q=1$.
The argument of such $q$-exponential would be expected to be proportional to
$N$, analogously to the thermodynamical entropy of many-body Hamiltonian
systems. We provide here numerical evidence supporting the asymptotic power-law
by analysing the standard map, the coherent noise model for biological
extinctions and earthquakes, the Ehrenfest dog-flea model, and the random-walk

relate surface morphology and dynamics during crystal growth to the underlying
mechanisms of adatom diffusion and attachment at steps. For an important class
of crystal surfaces, including the basal planes of hexagonal close-packed and
related systems, the steps in a sequence on a vicinal surface can exhibit
properties that alternate from step to step. Here we develop BCF theory for
such surfaces, relating observables such as alternating terrace widths as a
function of growth conditions to the kinetic coefficients for adatom attachment
at steps. We include the effects of step transparency and step-step repulsion.
A general solution is obtained for the dynamics of the terrace widths, assuming
quasi-steady-state adatom distributions on the terraces. An explicit simplified
analytical solution is obtained under widely applicable approximations. From
this we obtain expressions for the full-steady-state terrace fraction as a
function of growth rate. Fits of the theoretical predictions to recent
experimental determinations of the steady-state and dynamics of terrace
fractions on GaN (0001) surfaces during organo-metallic vapor phase epitaxy

In this paper, we focus on improving human pose estimation in videos of crowded

optical-flow. Specifically, for one frame, we forward the historical poses from
the previous frames and backward the future poses from the subsequent frames to
current frame, leading to stable and accurate human pose estimation in videos.

Internet for improving the diversity of training set. In this way, our model
achieves best performance on 7 out of 13 videos and 56.33 average w\_AP on test

  team collaborations using student gaze point prediction",,,,,"cs.CY cs.HC cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Automatic assessment and evaluation of team performance during collaborative
tasks is key to the learning analytics and computer-supported cooperative work
research. There is a growing interest in the use of gaze-oriented cues for
evaluating the collaboration and cooperativeness of teams. However, collecting
gaze data using eye-trackers is not always feasible due to time and cost
constraints. In this paper, we introduce an automated team assessment tool
based on gaze points and joint visual attention (JVA) information extracted by
computer vision solutions. We then evaluate team collaborations in an
undergraduate anatomy learning activity (N=60, 30 teams) as a test user-study.
The results indicate that higher JVA was positively associated with student
learning outcomes (r(30)=0.50,p<0.005). Moreover, teams who participated in two
experimental groups, and used interactive 3-D anatomy models, had higher JVA
(F(1,28)=6.65,p<0.05) and better knowledge retention (F(1,28) =7.56,p<0.05)
than those in the control group. Also, no significant difference was observed
based on JVA for different gender compositions of teams. The findings from this
work offer implications in learning sciences and collaborative computing by
providing a novel mutual attention-based measure to objectively evaluate team
collaboration dynamics.

provide information for identifying characteristics of the corresponding
explosive devices. Currently, the identification is done using heuristic
algorithms and direct subject matter expert review. An improvement in
predictive performance may be obtained by using machine learning, but this
application lends itself to high consequence national security decisions, so it
is not only important to provide high accuracy but clear explanations for the
predictions to garner confidence in the model. While much work has been done to
develop explainability methods for machine learning models, not much of the
work focuses on situations with input variables of the form of functional data
such optical spectral-temporal signatures. We propose a procedure for
explaining machine learning models fit using functional data that accounts for
the functional nature the data. Our approach makes use of functional principal
component analysis (fPCA) and permutation feature importance (PFI). fPCA is
used to transform the functions to create uncorrelated functional principal
components (fPCs). The model is trained using the fPCs as inputs, and PFI is
applied to identify the fPCs important to the model for prediction.
Visualizations are used to interpret the variability explained by the fPCs that
are found to be important by PFI to determine the aspects of the functions that
are important for prediction. We demonstrate the technique by explaining neural
networks fit to explosion optical spectral-temporal signatures for predicting
characteristics of the explosive devices.

individual models, with ensembles containing less than 50% of the parameters of

networks as GLM predictors, identifying a suitable representation for their
target domain. Further, we show how the diversity of our spiking ensembles can
be measured using the Ambiguity Decomposition. The work demonstrates how
ensembling can overcome the challenges of producing individual SNN models which
can compete with traditional deep neural networks, and creates systems with
fewer trainable parameters and smaller memory footprints, opening the door to
low-power edge applications, e.g. implemented on neuromorphic hardware.

understood: The block sizes of nilpotent Jordan blocks, arranged in pairs, have
to satisfy some simple algebraic property.
  More interesting are structured roots of structured matrices. Probably the
best known example is the existence and uniqueness of positive definite square
roots of a positive definite matrix. If one drops the requirement of positive
definiteness of the square root, it turns out that there exists an abundance of
square roots. Here a description of all canonical forms of all square roots is
possible and is straight forward.
  H-nonnegative matrices are H-selfadjoint and are nonnegative with respect to
an indefinite inner product with Gramian H. An H-nonnegative matrix $B$ allows
a decomposition in a negative definite, a nilpotent H-nonnegative, and a
positive definite matrix, B=B_- \oplus B_0 \oplus B_+. The interesting part is
B_0, as only Jordan blocks of size one and two occur. Determining a square root
of B reduces to determining a square root of each of B_-, B_0, and B_+. Here we
investigate for an H-nonnegative matrix: its square roots without additional
structure, as well as its structured square roots that are H-nonnegative or
H-selfadjoint.
  For these three classes of square roots of H-nonnegative matrices we show a
simple criterion for their existence and describe all possible canonical forms.
This is based mainly on known results but an important new part is that in all
three cases we describe all possible square roots of the nilpotent
H-nonnegative matrix B_0 explicitly. Moreover, we show how our results can be
applied to the conditional and unconditional stability of H-nonnegative square
roots of H-nonnegative matrices, where the explicit description of the square
roots of B_0 is used.

of $\psi$-classes with explicit rational coefficients. The formulae obtained in
this article result from lattice point counts involving the Kontsevich volume
polynomials that also appear in Mirzakhani's recursion for the Weil-Petersson
volumes of the moduli spaces of bordered hyperbolic surfaces with geodesic
boundaries. A similar formula for the Masur-Veech volume (though without
explicit evaluation) was obtained earlier by Mirzakhani via completely
different approach.
  Furthermore, we prove that the density of the mapping class group orbit of
any simple closed multicurve $\gamma$ inside the ambient set of integral
measured laminations computed by Mirzakhani coincides with the density of
square-tiled surfaces having horizontal cylinder decomposition associated to
$\gamma$ among all square-tiled surfaces in $\mathcal{Q}_{g,n}$.
  We study the resulting densities (or, equivalently, volume contributions) in
more detail in the special case $n=0$. In particular, we compute the asymptotic
frequencies of separating and non-separating simple closed geodesics on a
closed hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ for small $g$ and we show that for large
genera the separating closed geodesics are $\sqrt{\frac{2}{3\pi
g}}\cdot\frac{1}{4^g}$ times less frequent.
