low-fidelity data together with limited high-fidelity data to train surrogate
models, where the multi-fidelity data are generated from multiple underlying
models. The network takes a context set as input (physical observation points,
low fidelity solution at observed points) and output (high fidelity solution at
observed points) pairs. It uses the neural process to learn a distribution over
functions conditioned on context sets and provide the mean and standard
deviation at target sets. Moreover, the proposed framework also takes into
account the available physical laws that govern the data and imposes them as
constraints in the loss function. The multi-fidelity physical constraint
network (MFPC-Net) (1) takes datasets obtained from multiple models at the same
time in the training, (2) takes advantage of available physical information,
(3) learns a stochastic process which can encode prior beliefs about the
correlation between two fidelity with a few observations, and (4) produces
predictions with uncertainty. The ability of representing a class of functions
is ensured by the property of neural process and is achieved by the global
latent variables in the neural network. Physical constraints are added to the
loss using Lagrange multipliers. An algorithm to optimize the loss function is
proposed to effectively train the parameters in the network on an ad hoc basis.
Once trained, one can obtain fast evaluations at the entire domain of interest
given a few observation points from a new low-and high-fidelity model pair.
Particularly, one can further identify the unknown parameters such as
permeability fields in elliptic PDEs with a simple modification of the network.
Several numerical examples for both forward and inverse problems are presented
to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.

the underlying mechanisms by analyzing the energy competitions and the
essential changeovers of the quantum states, which enables us to extract most

connect with large Internet service providers (eyeball networks) through
dedicated private peering. The capacity of these private network interconnects
is provisioned to match the volume of the real content demand by the users.
Unfortunately, in case of a surge in traffic demand, for example due to a
content trending in a certain country, the capacity of the private interconnect
may deplete and the content provider/distributor would have to reroute the
excess traffic through transit providers. Although, such overflow events are
rare, they have significant negative impacts on content providers, Internet
service providers, and end-users. These include unexpected delays and
disruptions reducing the user experience quality, as well as direct costs paid
by the Internet service provider to the transit providers. If the traffic
overflow events could be predicted, the Internet service providers would be
able to influence the routes chosen for the excess traffic to reduce the costs
and increase user experience quality. In this article we propose a method based
on an ensemble of deep learning models to predict overflow events over a short
term horizon of 2-6 hours and predict the specific interconnections that will
ingress the overflow traffic. The method was evaluated with 2.5 years' traffic
measurement data from a large European Internet service provider resulting in a
true-positive rate of 0.8 while maintaining a 0.05 false-positive rate. The
lockdown imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the overflow prediction
accuracy. Nevertheless, starting from the end of April 2020 with the gradual

$(-\Delta )^s u=f$, with $0<s <1$. The definition of the fractional Laplacian
on the whole space $\mathbb R^n$, $n=1,2,3$ is understood through the Fourier
transform, see, e.g., Lischke et.al. (J. Comp. Phys., 2020). The real challenge
however represents the case when this equation is posed in a bounded domain
$\Omega$ and proper boundary conditions are needed for the correctness of the
corresponding problem. Let us mention here that the case of inhomogeneous
boundary data has been neglected up to the last years. The reason is that
imposing nonzero boundary conditions in the nonlocal setting is highly
nontrivial. There exist at least two different definitions of fractional
Laplacian, and there is still ongoing research about the relations of them.
They are not equivalent. The focus of our study is a new characterization of
the spectral fractional Laplacian. One of the major contributions concerns the
case when the right hand side $f$ is a Dirac $\delta$ function. For comparing
the differences between the solutions in the spectral and Riesz formulations,
we consider an inhomogeneous fractional Dirichlet problem. The provided
theoretical analysis is supported by model numerical tests.

Although standard SG-MCMC methods have shown great performance in a variety of
problems, they may be inefficient when the random variables in the target
posterior densities have scale differences or are highly correlated. In this
work, we present an adaptive Hessian approximated stochastic gradient MCMC
method to incorporate local geometric information while sampling from the
posterior. The idea is to apply stochastic approximation to sequentially update
a preconditioning matrix at each iteration. The preconditioner possesses
second-order information and can guide the random walk of a sampler
efficiently. Instead of computing and saving the full Hessian of the log
posterior, we use limited memory of the sample and their stochastic gradients
to approximate the inverse Hessian-vector multiplication in the updating
formula. Moreover, by smoothly optimizing the preconditioning matrix, our
proposed algorithm can asymptotically converge to the target distribution with
a controllable bias under mild conditions. To reduce the training and testing
computational burden, we adopt a magnitude-based weight pruning method to
enforce the sparsity of the network. Our method is user-friendly and is
scalable to standard SG-MCMC updating rules by implementing an additional
preconditioner. The sparse approximation of inverse Hessian alleviates storage
and computational complexities for large dimensional models. The bias
introduced by stochastic approximation is controllable and can be analyzed
theoretically. Numerical experiments are performed on several problems.

period. Floods during pandemic result in a compound hazard. Evacuations under
such situations are difficult to plan as social distancing is nearly impossible
in the highly crowded shelters. This results in a multi-objective problem with
conflicting objectives of maximizing the number of evacuees from flood-prone
regions and minimizing the number of infections at the end of the shelter's
stay. To the best of our knowledge, such a problem is yet to be explored in
literature. Here we develop a simulation-optimization framework, where multiple
objectives are handled with a max-min approach. The simulation model consists
of an extended Susceptible Exposed Infectious Recovered Susceptible (SEIRS)

addition to commit decisions in the BFT model. By doing so, it enables the
clients to choose the response fault model for its commands. Internally, DuoBFT
commits each client command under both the hybrid and Byzantine models, but
since hybrid commits take fewer communication steps and use smaller quorums
than BFT commits, clients can benefit from the low-latency commits in the
hybrid model.
  DuoBFT uses a common view-change change protocol to handle both fault models.
To achieve this, we enable a notion called Flexible Quorums in the hybrid fault
model by revisiting the quorum intersection requirements in hybrid protocols.
The flexible quorum technique enables having a hybrid view change quorum that
is of the same size as a BFT view-change quorum. This paves a path for
efficiently combining both the fault models within a single unified protocol.
Our evaluation on a wide-area deployment reveal that DuoBFT can provide hybrid

throughput. In absolute terms, DuoBFT provides sub-200-millisecond latency in a

critical limit will end up in a trailing shear layer and accumulate into
secondary vortices. The secondary vortices are typically considerably smaller
than the primary vortex. Here, we focus on the formation, shedding, and
trajectory of secondary vortices generated by a rotating rectangular plate in a
quiescent fluid using time-resolved particle image velocimetry. The Reynolds
number (Re) is varied from 840 to 11150. At low Re, the shear layer is a
continuous uninterrupted layer of vorticity that rolls up into a single
coherent primary vortex. At Re=1955, the shear layer becomes unstable. For
Re>4000, secondary vortices are discretely released from the plate tip. First,
we demonstrate that the roll-up of the shear layer, the trajectory of the

analysed. The time interval between the release of successive secondary
vortices is not constant during the rotation but increases the more vortices
have been shed. The shedding time interval also increases with decreasing
Reynolds number. The increased time interval under both conditions is due to a
reduced circulation feeding rate.

which are at distance $k$ from $X$. Every vertex of the 2D regular grid has
outdegree $2$, the vertices at the boundary have indegree $1$, and all other
vertices have indegree $2$. At time $0$, $X$ is given a random bit. At time
$k\geq 1$, each vertex in layer $k$ receives transmitted bits from its parents
in layer $k-1$, where the bits pass through binary symmetric channels with
noise level $\delta\in(0,1/2)$. Then, each vertex combines its received bits
using a common Boolean processing function to produce an output bit. The
objective is to recover $X$ with probability of error better than $1/2$ from

progress towards establishing this conjecture, and prove using ideas from
percolation and coding theory that recovery of $X$ is impossible for any

Furthermore, we propose a martingale-based approach that establishes the
impossibility of recovering $X$ for any $\delta$ when all NAND processing

areas and depths of a 4-micron feature in these spectra, which has been
attributed to sulfur dioxide (SO2), as well as carbonates, in previously
collected datasets of this moon. All eight spectra we collected display the
4-micron band. The four spectra collected over Callisto's leading hemisphere
display significantly stronger 4-micron bands compared to the four trailing
hemisphere spectra (> 3-sigma difference). We compared the central wavelength
position and shape of Callisto's 4-micron band to laboratory spectra of various
sulfur-bearing species and carbonates. Our comparison demonstrates that
Callisto's 4-micron band has a spectral signature similar to thermally-altered

family of generative probabilistic models for test responses, used to quantify
traits in individuals relative to target populations. The graded response model
(GRM) is a particular IRT model that is used for ordered polytomous test
responses. Both the development and the application of the GRM and other IRT
models require statistical decisions. For formulating these models
(calibration), one needs to decide on methodologies for item selection,
inference, and regularization. For applying these models (test scoring), one
needs to make similar decisions, often prioritizing computational tractability
and/or interpretability. In many applications, such as in the Work Disability
Functional Assessment Battery (WD-FAB), tractability implies approximating an
individual's score distribution using estimates of mean and variance, and
obtaining that score conditional on only point estimates of the calibrated
model. In this manuscript, we evaluate the calibration and scoring of models
under this common use-case using Bayesian cross-validation. Applied to the
WD-FAB responses collected for the National Institutes of Health, we assess the
predictive power of implementations of the GRM based on their ability to yield,
on validation sets of respondents, ability estimates that are most predictive
of patterns of item responses. Our main finding indicates that regularized
Bayesian calibration of the GRM outperforms the regularization-free empirical
Bayesian procedure of marginal maximum likelihood. We also motivate the use of
compactly supported priors in test scoring.

requirement. Modern software systems are highly-configurable and
misconfigurations may easily cause performance issues. A software system that
suffers performance issues may exhibit low program throughput and long response
time. However, the sheer size of the configuration space makes it challenging
for administrators to manually select and adjust the configuration options to
achieve better performance. In this paper, we propose ConfRL, an approach to
tune software performance automatically. The key idea of ConfRL is to use
reinforcement learning to explore the configuration space by a trial-and-error
approach and to use the feedback received from the environment to tune
configuration option values to achieve better performance. To reduce the cost
of reinforcement learning, ConfRL employs sampling, clustering, and dynamic
state reduction techniques to keep states in a large configuration space
manageable. Our evaluation of four real-world highly-configurable server

systems to achieve higher long-term performance.

from unconstrained RGB monocular night-time images which is a difficult task
that has not been addressed adequately in the literature. The state-of-the-art
day-time depth estimation methods fail miserably when tested with night-time
images due to a large domain shift between them. The usual photo metric losses
used for training these networks may not work for night-time images due to the
absence of uniform lighting which is commonly present in day-time images,
making it a difficult problem to solve. We propose to solve this problem by
posing it as a domain adaptation problem where a network trained with day-time
images is adapted to work for night-time images. Specifically, an encoder is
trained to generate features from night-time images that are indistinguishable
from those obtained from day-time images by using a PatchGAN-based adversarial
discriminative learning method. Unlike the existing methods that directly adapt
depth prediction (network output), we propose to adapt feature maps obtained
from the encoder network so that a pre-trained day-time depth decoder can be
directly used for predicting depth from these adapted features. Hence, the
resulting method is termed as ""Adversarial Domain Feature Adaptation (ADFA)""
and its efficacy is demonstrated through experimentation on the challenging
Oxford night driving dataset. Also, The modular encoder-decoder architecture
for the proposed ADFA method allows us to use the encoder module as a feature
extractor which can be used in many other applications. One such application is
demonstrated where the features obtained from our adapted encoder network are
shown to outperform other state-of-the-art methods in a visual place
recognition problem, thereby, further establishing the usefulness and
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

method. One drawback is that it requires the computation of the full gradient

iteration, a single coordinate is randomly selected to be updated by a multiple
of the partial derivative along this direction plus noise, and all other
coordinates remain untouched. We investigate the total complexity of RC-LMC and
compare it with the classical LMC for log-concave probability distributions.
When the gradient of the log-density is Lipschitz, RC-LMC is less expensive
than the classical LMC if the log-density is highly skewed for high dimensional
problems, and when both the gradient and the Hessian of the log-density are
Lipschitz, RC-LMC is always cheaper than the classical LMC, by a factor
proportional to the square root of the problem dimension. In the latter case,
our estimate of complexity is sharp with respect to the dimension.

A counter-clockwise rotating plate at the center of the cavity acts as active

the numerical solution is achieved using Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE)
finite element formulation with a quadrilateral discretization scheme.
Transient parametric simulations have been performed for various frequency of
the rotating plate for a fixed Reynolds number (Re) of 100 based on maximum
inlet flow velocity while the Richardson number (Ri) is maintained at unity.
Heat transfer performance has been evaluated in terms of spatially averaged

start to deviate from each other at higher values of velocity ratio (> 4).

signal to clock their computational logic. However, standard distribution
solutions are not fault-tolerant. In this work, we present a simple grid
structure as a more reliable clock propagation method and study it by means of
simulation experiments. Fault-tolerance is achieved by forwarding clock pulses
on arrival of the second of three incoming signals from the previous layer.
  A key question is how well neighboring grid nodes are synchronized, even
without faults. Analyzing the clock skew under typical-case conditions is
highly challenging. Because the forwarding mechanism involves taking the
median, standard probabilistic tools fail, even when modeling link delays just
by unbiased coin flips.
  Our statistical approach provides substantial evidence that this system
performs surprisingly well. Specifically, in an ""infinitely wide"" grid of
height~$H$, the delay at a pre-selected node exhibits a standard deviation of
$O(H^{1/4})$ ($\approx 2.7$ link delay uncertainties for $H=2000$) and skew
between adjacent nodes of $o(\log \log H)$ ($\approx 0.77$ link delay
uncertainties for $H=2000$). We conclude that the proposed system is a very
promising clock distribution method. This leads to the open problem of a
stochastic explanation of the tight concentration of delays and skews. More
generally, we believe that understanding our very simple abstraction of the
system is of mathematical interest in its own right.

limitations which pose a significant obstacle when processing large scale and

by the well-known streaming model, which can be traced back to Munro and
Paterson `78 and has had significant impact in theory and beyond. In the
classical streaming setting, one must compute some function $f$ of a stream of
updates $\mathcal{S} = \{u_1,\ldots,u_m\}$, given restricted single-pass access
to the stream. The primary complexity measure is the space used by the
algorithm.
  We take the first steps towards understanding the connection between
streaming and neural algorithms. On the upper bound side, we design neural
algorithms based on known streaming algorithms for fundamental tasks, including
distinct elements, approximate median, heavy hitters, and more. The number of
neurons in our neural solutions almost matches the space bounds of the
corresponding streaming algorithms. As a general algorithmic primitive, we show
how to implement the important streaming technique of linear sketching
efficient in spiking neural networks. On the lower bound side, we give a
generic reduction, showing that any space-efficient spiking neural network can
be simulated by a space-efficiently streaming algorithm. This reduction lets us
translate streaming-space lower bounds into nearly matching neural-space lower
bounds, establishing a close connection between these two models.

in higher dimensions is critical for numerous applications, including the
computation of chemical reaction rates and transport of objects in the solar
system. Many topological techniques have been developed to study maps of
two-dimensional (2D) phase spaces, but extending these techniques to higher
dimensions is often a major challenge or even impossible. Previously, one such
technique, homotopic lobe dynamics (HLD), was generalized to analyze the stable
and unstable manifolds of hyperbolic fixed points for volume-preserving maps in
three dimensions. This prior work assumed the existence of an equatorial
heteroclinic intersection curve, which was the natural generalization of the 2D
case. The present work extends the previous analysis to the case where no such
equatorial curve exists, but where intersection curves, connecting fixed points
may exist. In order to extend HLD to this case, we shift our perspective from
the invariant manifolds of the fixed points to the invariant manifolds of the
invariant circle formed by the fixed-point-to-fixed-point intersections. The
output of the HLD technique is a symbolic description of the minimal underlying
topology of the invariant manifolds. We demonstrate this approach through a
series of examples.

being born in dense interstellar environment, the youngest ones that did not
had time to move away from their formation location are a probe of the densest

the usual Wannier functions are not well defined and gauge optimization is
impossible. To tackle the problem of calculating exponentially localized
generalized Wannier functions in both periodic and non-periodic system we
discuss the ""Iterated Projected Position (IPP)"" algorithm. The IPP algorithm is
based on matrix diagonalization and therefore unlike optimization based
approaches it does not require initialization and cannot get stuck at a local
minimum. Furthermore, the IPP algorithm is guaranteed by a rigorous analysis to
produce exponentially localized functions under certain mild assumptions. We
numerically demonstrate that the IPP algorithm can be used to calculate
exponentially localized bases for the Haldane model, the Kane-Mele model (in
both $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant even and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant odd phases),
and the $p_x + i p_y$ model on a quasi-crystal lattice.

Schlosser","Proof of a bi-symmetric septuple equidistribution on ascent sequences","34 pages, 14 figures",,,,"math.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  It is well known since the seminal work by Bousquet-M\'elou, Claesson, Dukes
and Kitaev (2010) that certain refinements of the ascent sequences with respect
to several natural statistics are in bijection with corresponding refinements
of $({\bf2+2})$-free posets and permutations that avoid a bivincular pattern.
Different multiply-refined enumerations of ascent sequences and other
bijectively equivalent structures have subsequently been extensively studied by
various authors.
  In this paper, our main contributions are
  1. a bijective proof of a bi-symmetric septuple equidistribution of
statistics on ascent sequences, involving the number of ascents (asc), the
number of repeated entries (rep), the number of zeros (zero), the number of
maximal entries (max), the number of right-to-left minima (rmin) and two
auxiliary statistics;
  2. a new transformation formula for non-terminating basic hypergeometric
$_4\phi_3$ series expanded as an analytic function in base $q$ around $q=1$,
which is utilized to prove two (bi)-symmetric quadruple equidistributions on
ascent sequences.
  A by-product of our findings includes the affirmation of a conjecture about
the bi-symmetric equidistribution between the quadruples of Euler--Stirling
statistics (asc,rep,zero,max) and (rep,asc,max,zero) on ascent sequences, that
was motivated by a double Eulerian equidistribution due to Foata (1977) and
recently proposed by Fu, Lin, Yan, Zhou and the first author (2018).

which replaces traditional fuel vehicles to reduce carbon emissions and protect
the environment. EVs need to be charged, but the number of charging piles in a
Charging Station (CS) is limited and charging is usually more time-consuming
than fueling. According to this scenario, we propose a secure and efficient
charging scheduling system based on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-blockchain
and double auction mechanism. In a smart area, it attempts to assign EVs to the
available CSs in the light of their submitted charging requests and status
information. First, we design a lightweight charging scheduling framework that
integrates DAG-blockchain and modern cryptography technology to ensure security
and scalability during performing scheduling and completing tradings. In this
process, a constrained multi-item double auction problem is formulated because
of the limited charging resources in a CS, which motivates EVs and CSs in this
area to participate in the market based on their preferences and statuses. Due
to this constraint, our problem is more complicated and harder to achieve
truthfulness as well as system efficiency compared to the existing double
auction model. To adapt to it, we propose two algorithms, namely Truthful
Mechanism for Charging (TMC) and Efficient Mechanism for Charging (EMC), to
determine an assignment between EVs and CSs and pricing strategies. Then, both
theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show the correctness and
effectiveness of our proposed algorithms.

modelling of spread of an alarm, a social contagion, or a social influence or

  Graph burning runs on discrete time-steps (or rounds). At each step $t$,
first (a) an unburned vertex is burned (as a \textit{fire source}) from
""outside"", and then (b) the fire spreads to vertices adjacent to the vertices
which are burned till step $t-1$. This process stops after all the vertices of
$G$ have been burned. The aim is to burn all the vertices in a given graph in
minimum time-steps. The least number of time-steps required to burn a graph is
called its \textit{burning number}. The less the burning number is, the faster
a graph can be burned.
  Burning a general graph optimally is an NP-Complete problem. It has been
proved that optimal burning of path forests, spider graphs, and trees with
maximum degree three is NP-Complete. We study the \textit{graph burning

Consensus methods show varied success in handling the challenge of decoy
selection despite some issues associated with clustering large decoy sets and
decoy sets that do not show much structural similarity. Recent investigations
into energy landscape-based decoy selection approaches show promises. However,
lack of generalization over varied test cases remains a bottleneck for these
methods. We propose a novel decoy selection method, ML-Select, a machine
learning framework that exploits the energy landscape associated with the
structure space probed through a template-free decoy generation. The proposed
method outperforms both clustering and energy ranking-based methods, all the

ML-Select shows promising results even for the decoy sets consisting of mostly
low-quality decoys. ML-Select is a useful method for decoy selection. This work
suggests further research in finding more effective ways to adopt machine

employing instantaneous speeds (maximum speed and the CME speed and Mach number

than the average speed. Our preliminary results show a better correlation by
this approach. In addition, the correlations show that the fluxes of protons in

the SGS contributions of coherent structures over Lagrangian pathlines. SGS-w
assumes that an average cascade of TKE from large- to small-scales occurs

show that the consideration of vortex stretching resolves about $18$% more TKE

that the aerodynamic response of the forest canopy is linked to the morphology
of the forest cover. Sweep- and ejection-events of the spatially intermittent

warped moving images, similar to conventional image registration algorithms. It
is implemented in a multi-resolution image registration framework to optimize
and learn spatial transformations at different image resolutions jointly and
incrementally with deep self-supervision in order to better handle large
deformation between images. A spatial Gaussian smoothing kernel is integrated
with the FCNs to yield sufficiently smooth deformation fields to achieve
diffeomorphic image registration. Particularly, spatial transformations learned
at coarser resolutions are utilized to warp the moving image, which is
subsequently used for learning incremental transformations at finer
resolutions. This procedure proceeds recursively to the full image resolution
and the accumulated transformations serve as the final transformation to warp
the moving image at the finest resolution. Experimental results for registering
high resolution 3D structural brain magnetic resonance (MR) images have
demonstrated that image registration networks trained by our method obtain
robust, diffeomorphic image registration results within seconds with improved

of pN2. We find that the stellar flux threshold for the runaway greenhouse is a
non-monotonous function of pN2. This is due to the competing effects of five
processes: pressure broadening, heat capacity, lapse rate, relative humidity,
and clouds. These competing processes increase the complexity in predicting the
location of the inner edge of the habitable zone. For a slow rotation orbit of
60 Earth days, the critical stellar flux for the runaway greenhouse onset is
1700--1750, 1900--1950, and 1750--1800 W m$^{-2}$ under 0.25, 1.0, and 4.0 bar

within ~13%. For a rapid rotation orbit, the effect of varying pN2 on the inner
edge is smaller, within a range of ~7%. Moreover, we show that Rayleigh
scattering effect as varying pN2 is unimportant for the inner edge due to the
masking effect of cloud scattering and to the strong shortwave absorption by
water vapor under hot climates. Future work using AGCMs having different cloud

conventional ranking systems. While this maximizes traditional criteria of
ranking performance, there is a growing understanding that it is an
oversimplification in online platforms that serve not only a diverse user
population, but also the producers of the items. In particular, ranking
algorithms are expected to be fair in how they serve all groups of users -- not
just the majority group -- and they also need to be fair in how they divide
exposure among the items. These fairness considerations can partially be met by
adding diversity to the rankings, as done in several recent works. However, we
show in this paper that user fairness, item fairness and diversity are
fundamentally different concepts. In particular, we find that algorithms that
consider only one of the three desiderata can fail to satisfy and even harm the
other two. To overcome this shortcoming, we present the first ranking algorithm
that explicitly enforces all three desiderata. The algorithm optimizes user and
item fairness as a convex optimization problem which can be solved optimally.
From its solution, a ranking policy can be derived via a novel Birkhoff-von
Neumann decomposition algorithm that optimizes diversity. Beyond the
theoretical analysis, we investigate empirically on a new benchmark dataset how
effectively the proposed ranking algorithm can control user fairness, item
fairness and diversity, as well as the trade-offs between them.

to design a task scheduling policy that minimizes offloading and computing
delay of all tasks given the UAV energy capacity constraint. To this end, we
first formulate the online scheduling problem as an energy-constrained Markov

a novel deep risk-sensitive reinforcement learning algorithm. Specifically, the
algorithm evaluates the risk, which measures the energy consumption that
exceeds the constraint, for each state and searches the optimal parameter
weighing the minimization of delay and risk while learning the optimal policy.
Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can reduce

quickly propels them into various real-life applications across different

spectrum of spatial frequencies, i.e. beyond the low-frequency dominant
spectrum of natural images, is critical for assessing the reliability of GAN
generated data in any detail-sensitive application (e.g. denoising, filling and
super-resolution in medical and satellite images). In this paper, we show that
the ability of convolutional GANs to learn a distribution is significantly
affected by the spatial frequency of the underlying carrier signal, that is,
GANs have a bias against learning high spatial frequencies. Crucially, we show
that this bias is not merely a result of the scarcity of high frequencies in

frequencies regardless of their prominence in a dataset. Furthermore, we
explain why large-scale GANs' ability to generate fine details on natural

we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced PRG model based on capsule graph neural

for inferring the aspect sequence. Then, conditioned on the inferred aspect
label, we design a graph-based copy mechanism to generate sentences by
incorporating related entities or words from HKG. To our knowledge, we are the
first to utilize knowledge graph for the PRG task. The incorporated KG
information is able to enhance user preference at both aspect and word levels.

the spin-orbit torque (SOT) efficiency (for the direct effect) and the inverse
Rashba-Edelstein effect length (for the inverse effect), which statistically
show good agreement with the existing experimental data on wide varieties of

Fermi surface contributions and fundamentally different from the conventional
views of the SOT efficiency that includes contributions from all the occupied

analysis is starting to play an essential role in the early detection of
Melanoma. The ISIC Archive is one of the most used skin lesion sources to
benchmark deep learning-based tools. Bissoto et al. experimented with different
bounding-box based masks and showed that deep learning models could classify
skin lesion images without clinically meaningful information in the input data.
Their findings seem confounding since the ablated regions (random rectangular
boxes) are not significant. The shape of the lesion is a crucial factor in the
clinical characterization of a skin lesion. In that context, we performed a set
of experiments that generate shape-preserving masks instead of rectangular
bounding-box based masks. A deep learning model trained on these
shape-preserving masked images does not outperform models trained on images
without clinically meaningful information. That strongly suggests spurious
correlations guiding the models. We propose use of general adversarial network

is shown that the gauge invariant induced gravitational waves can be obtained
by subtracting the fictitious tensor perturbations via introducing the counter

uniquely determines the energy density spectrum of the scalar induced

directly with the formal grammar-structure of the objects it seeks to
represent. This formal grammar-structure specifies the kind of components that
make up an object, and also the configurations they are allowed to be in. In
other words, objects can be described as a parse-tree of its components -- a
structure that can be seen as a candidate for building connection-patterns
among neurons in neural networks. We present a formal grammar description of
convolutional neural networks and capsule networks that shows how capsule
networks can enforce such parse-tree structures, while CNNs do not.
Specifically, we show that the entropy of routing coefficients in the dynamic
routing algorithm controls this ability. Thus, we introduce the entropy of
routing weights as a loss function for better compositionality among capsules.
We show by experiments, on data with a compositional structure, that the use of
this loss enables capsule networks to better detect changes in
compositionality. Our experiments show that as the entropy of the routing
weights increases, the ability to detect changes in compositionality reduces.
We see that, without routing, capsule networks perform similar to convolutional
neural networks in that both these models perform badly at detecting changes in
compositionality. Our results indicate that routing is an important part of
capsule networks -- effectively answering recent work that has questioned its
necessity. We also, by experiments on SmallNORB, CIFAR-10, and FashionMNIST,
show that this loss keeps the accuracy of capsule network models comparable to

Unfortunately, focused transducers have narrow depth of field. Here, we
developed a Bessel ultrasonic transducer for large depth of field by using
conical acoustic lens. An acoustic lens is attached to a unfocused ultrasonic.
And the acoustic lens is a cuboid prism with a concave cone on the bottom, made
of fused silica. Similar to an axicon that can generate a Bessel beam, the
Bessel ultrasonic transducer can produce nondiffracting Bessel ultrasonic
beams. Therefore, extended depth of field with uniformly high resolution and
high detection sensitivity can be obtained. We used COMSOL to simulate the
transmission of ultrasonic field of the designed conical acoustic lens, and
compare it with the spherical focused ultrasonic transducer. The results show
that the depth of field of the Bessel ultrasonic transducer is about 8 times
that of the conventional spherical focused ultrasonic transducer. And the depth
of field of the Bessel ultrasonic transducer can be further adjusted by
adjusting the cone angle of the conical acoustic lens. The Bessel ultrasonic
transducer will help improve the capabilities of the ultrasound probe and
expand its application range. For example, an ultrasonic probe with a large
depth of field will expand the imaging depth of photoacoustic microscopy and
enhance its ability in non-destructive testing.

user behavior data, and their performance may be not optimal when labeled data
is scarce. Motivated by pre-trained language models which are pre-trained on
large-scale unlabeled corpus to empower many downstream tasks, in this paper we
propose to pre-train user models from large-scale unlabeled user behaviors
data. We propose two self-supervision tasks for user model pre-training. The
first one is masked behavior prediction, which can model the relatedness
between historical behaviors. The second one is next $K$ behavior prediction,
which can model the relatedness between past and future behaviors. The
pre-trained user models are finetuned in downstream tasks to learn
task-specific user representations. Experimental results on two real-world
datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed user model pre-training

a structured meta-learning (SML) approach for dialogue generation on infrequent

high-resource sentence functions data. Furthermore, SML enhances meta-learning

the informativeness and relevance of generated responses, but also can generate

multiple complicated factors and appear as multicomponent nonstationary modes.
In such and many other situations, it is necessary to separate these signals
into a finite number of monocomponents to represent the intrinsic modes and
underlying dynamics implicated in the source signals. In this paper, we
consider the mode retrieval of a multicomponent signal which has crossing
instantaneous frequencies (IFs), meaning that some of the components of the
signal overlap in the time-frequency domain. We use the chirplet transform (CT)
to represent a multicomponent signal in the three-dimensional space of time,
frequency and chirp rate and introduce a CT-based signal separation scheme
(CT3S) to retrieve modes. In addition, we analyze the error bounds for IF
estimation and component recovery with this scheme. We also propose a
matched-filter along certain specific time-frequency lines with respect to the
chirp rate to make nonstationary signals be further separated and more
concentrated in the three-dimensional space of CT. Furthermore, based on the
approximation of source signals with linear chirps at any local time, we
propose an innovative signal reconstruction algorithm, called the group
  filter-matched CT3S (GFCT3S), which also takes a group of components into
consideration simultaneously. GFCT3S is suitable for signals with crossing IFs.
It also decreases component recovery errors when the IFs curves of different
components are not crossover, but fast-varying and close to one and other.
Numerical experiments on synthetic and real signals show our method is more
accurate and consistent in signal separation than the empirical mode
decomposition, synchrosqueezing transform, and other approaches

centralized viewpoint. Despite the fact fault tolerant preservers are mainly
motivated by the error-prone nature of distributed networks, not much is known
on the distributed computational aspects of these structures.
  In this paper, we present distributed algorithms for constructing fault
tolerant distance preservers and $+2$ additive spanners that are resilient to
at most \emph{two edge} faults. Prior to our work, the only non-trivial
constructions known were for the \emph{single} fault and \emph{single source}

  Our key technical contribution is a distributed algorithm for computing
distance preservers w.r.t. a subset $S$ of source vertices, resilient to two
edge faults. The output structure contains a BFS tree $BFS(s,G \setminus
\{e_1,e_2\})$ for every $s \in S$ and every $e_1,e_2 \in G$. The distributed
construction of this structure is based on a delicate balance between the edge
congestion (formed by running multiple BFS trees simultaneously) and the
sparsity of the output subgraph. No sublinear-round algorithms for constructing

controls their macroscopic sliding. Interface rupture dynamics depend markedly
on the mechanical properties of the bulk materials that bound the frictional
interface. When the materials are similar, recent experimental and theoretical
work has shown that shear cracks described by Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics
(LEFM) quantitatively describe the rupture of frictional interfaces. When the
elastic properties of the two materials are dissimilar, many new effects take
place that result from bimaterial coupling: the normal stress at the interface
is elastodynamically coupled to local slip rates. At low rupture velocities,
bimaterial coupling is not very significant and interface rupture is governed
by `bimaterial cracks' that are described well by LEFM. As rupture velocities
increase, we experimentally and theoretically show how bimaterial cracks become
unstable at a subsonic critical rupture velocity, $c_T$. When the rupture
direction opposes the direction of applied shear in the softer material, we
show that $c_T$ is the subsonic limiting velocity. When ruptures propagate in
the direction of applied shear in the softer material, we demonstrate that
$c_T$ provides an explanation for how and when slip pulses (new rupture modes
characterized by spatially localized slip) are generated. This work completes
the fundamental physical description of how the frictional rupture of
bimaterial interfaces takes place.

with existing two-material compressible flow models obtained by reducing the BN

the kinetic energy exchange around material interfaces very effectively. Then a
second-order accurate extension of the energy-splitting Godunov-type scheme is
made using the generalized Riemann problem (GRP) solver. Numerical experiments

so that they can isolate themselves till the result of their coronavirus test

unclear how to efficiently discover such a set of roles. To solve this problem,
we propose to first decompose joint action spaces into restricted role action
spaces by clustering actions according to their effects on the environment and
other agents. Learning a role selector based on action effects makes role
discovery much easier because it forms a bi-level learning hierarchy -- the
role selector searches in a smaller role space and at a lower temporal
resolution, while role policies learn in significantly reduced primitive
action-observation spaces. We further integrate information about action
effects into the role policies to boost learning efficiency and policy
generalization. By virtue of these advances, our method (1) outperforms the
current state-of-the-art MARL algorithms on 10 of the 14 scenarios that
comprise the challenging StarCraft II micromanagement benchmark and (2)
achieves rapid transfer to new environments with three times the number of

Strategies (ESs) in order to address a class of global optimization problems
that could benefit from fine discretization of their decision variables. Such
problems arise in engineering and scientific applications, which possess a
multi-resolution control nature, and thus may be formulated either by means of
low-resolution variants (providing coarser approximations with presumably lower
accuracy for the general problem) or by high-resolution controls. A particular
scientific application concerns practical Quantum Control (QC) problems, whose
targeted optimal controls may be discretized to increasingly higher resolution,
which in turn carries the potential to obtain better control yields. However,
state-of-the-art derivative-free optimization heuristics for high-resolution
formulations nominally call for an impractically large number of objective
function calls. Therefore, an effective algorithmic treatment for such problems
is needed. We introduce a framework with an automated scheme to facilitate
guided-search over increasingly finer levels of control resolution for the
optimization problem, whose on-the-fly learned parameters require careful
adaptation. We instantiate the proposed m-lev self-adaptive ES framework by two
specific strategies, namely the classical elitist single-child (1+1)-ES and the
non-elitist multi-child derandomized $(\mu_W,\lambda)$-sep-CMA-ES. We first
show that the approach is suitable by simulation-based optimization of QC
systems which were heretofore viewed as too complex to address. We also present
a laboratory proof-of-concept for the proposed approach on a basic experimental
QC system objective.

suffering from the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. Previous work has
shown that leveraging memory in the form of a replay buffer can reduce
performance degradation on prior tasks. We hypothesize that forgetting can be
further reduced when the model is encouraged to remember the \textit{evidence}
for previously made decisions. As a first step towards exploring this
hypothesis, we propose a simple novel training paradigm, called Remembering for
the Right Reasons (RRR), that additionally stores visual model explanations for
each example in the buffer and ensures the model has ""the right reasons"" for
its predictions by encouraging its explanations to remain consistent with those
used to make decisions at training time. Without this constraint, there is a
drift in explanations and increase in forgetting as conventional continual
learning algorithms learn new tasks. We demonstrate how RRR can be easily added
to any memory or regularization-based approach and results in reduced
forgetting, and more importantly, improved model explanations. We have
evaluated our approach in the standard and few-shot settings and observed a
consistent improvement across various CL approaches using different
architectures and techniques to generate model explanations and demonstrated
our approach showing a promising connection between explainability and

matter (CSM) that the ejecta of many core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) collide
with within several days after explosion results from a dense zone where in
addition to the stellar wind there is gas that does not reach the escape
velocity. In this effervescent zone around red supergiant (RSG) stars, there
are dense clumps that are ejected from the vicinity of the RSG surface, rise to
radii of tens of astronomical units, and then fall back. I consider two simple
velocity distributions of the ejected clumps. I find that the density of the
bound mass can be tens of times that of the escaping wind, and therefore can
mimic a very high mass loss rate. The dense effervescent compact CSM zone can
(1) explain the collision of the ejecta of many CCSNe with a dense compact CSM
days after explosion, (2) facilitate very high mass loss rate if the star
experiences powerful pre-explosion activity, (3) form dust that obscures the
progenitor in the visible band, and (4) lead to an efficient mass transfer to a
stellar companion at separations of tens of astronomical units, if exists. The
effervescent zone might exist for thousands of years and more, and therefore
the effervescent CSM model removes the requirement from many type II CCSN
progenitors to experience a very strong outburst just years to months before
explosion.

the massive amount of annotated training data. However, in practice, medical

Considering multi-modality data with the same anatomic structures are widely
available in clinic routine, in this paper, we aim to exploit the prior
knowledge (e.g., shape priors) learned from one modality (aka., assistant
modality) to improve the segmentation performance on another modality (aka.,
target modality) to make up annotation scarcity. To alleviate the learning
difficulties caused by modality-specific appearance discrepancy, we first
present an Image Alignment Module (IAM) to narrow the appearance gap between
assistant and target modality data.We then propose a novel Mutual Knowledge
Distillation (MKD) scheme to thoroughly exploit the modality-shared knowledge
to facilitate the target-modality segmentation. To be specific, we formulate
our framework as an integration of two individual segmentors. Each segmentor
not only explicitly extracts one modality knowledge from corresponding
annotations, but also implicitly explores another modality knowledge from its
counterpart in mutual-guided manner. The ensemble of two segmentors would
further integrate the knowledge from both modalities and generate reliable
segmentation results on target modality. Experimental results on the public
multi-class cardiac segmentation data, i.e., MMWHS 2017, show that our method
achieves large improvements on CT segmentation by utilizing additional MRI data
and outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-modality learning methods.

sciences, a fundamental class of problems is related to the prediction of the
final state of the presence of individual opinions in a large population. The
main aspects investigated in the opinion dynamics are related to the
possibility of reaching an agreement and the time needed. In general a
consensus model allows to understand if a set of interacting agents can reach a
consensus when choosing among several options: political vote, opinions,
cultural features are well-known examples of them. Opinion dynamics models then
can be seen as a sub-set of consensus models, when the options to choose from
are opinions and the possible social consensus to be reached is the opinion
agreement. Moreover, in large populations it is intuitive to find moderates,
whose opinion is not at the extremes of the political opinion spectrum. Due to
the wide range of their empirical presence, the study of their influence in the
opinion dynamics processes is very important to enhance the comprehension of
the political opinions evolution in large populations. The Deffuant model is
aimed at studying consensus formation assuming that the opinion distribution of
a population evolves via a sequence of random pairwise encounters. In this work
we strive to extend the classical Deffuant model with the presence of moderates
in addition to the extremists, so as to study the emergence of consensus with
different initial configurations of opinions and parameters. Therefore, we
assess the role and the importance of the moderates for the appearance of
consensus in the opinion dynamics processes within in large populations. We
show that the population behavior is affected by the presence of a critical
number of moderates, in specific configurations of the model parameters: when
this threshold is reached the opinions in the population progressively converge

certain assumptions, whitening the activations reduces the Fisher information
matrix to a simple identity matrix, in which case stochastic gradient descent
is equivalent to the faster natural gradient descent. Due to the additional
complexity resulting from transforming the layer inputs and their corresponding
gradients in the forward and backward propagation, and from repeatedly
computing the Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD), this method is not commonly used
to date. In this work, we address the complexity drawbacks of feature
whitening. Our contribution is twofold. First, we derive an equivalent method,
which replaces the sample transformations by a transformation to the weight
gradients, applied to every batch of B samples. The complexity is reduced by a
factor of S=(2B), where S denotes the feature dimension of the layer output. As
the batch size increases with distributed training, the benefit of using the
proposed method becomes more compelling. Second, motivated by the theoretical
relation between the condition number of the sample covariance matrix and the
convergence speed, we derive an alternative sub-optimal algorithm which
recursively reduces the condition number of the latter matrix. Compared to EVD,
complexity is reduced by a factor of the input feature dimension M. We
exemplify the proposed algorithms with ResNet-based networks for image
classification demonstrated on the CIFAR and Imagenet datasets. Parallelizing
the proposed algorithms is straightforward and we implement a distributed
version thereof. Improved convergence, in terms of speed and attained accuracy,
can be observed in our experiments.

together in a single package. These are attractive for use as accelerators but
due to limited on-chip memory and multiple levels of memory hierarchy, the way
in which programmers offload kernels needs to be carefully considered. In this
paper we use Python as a vehicle for exploring the semantics and abstractions
of higher level programming languages to support the offloading of
computational kernels to these devices. By moving to a pass by reference model,
along with leveraging memory kinds, we demonstrate the ability to easily and
efficiently take advantage of multiple levels in the memory hierarchy, even
ones that are not directly accessible to the micro-cores. Using a machine
learning benchmark, we perform experiments on both Epiphany-III and MicroBlaze
based micro-cores, demonstrating the ability to compute with data sets of
arbitrarily large size. To provide context of our results, we explore the
performance and power efficiency of these technologies, demonstrating that
whilst these two micro-core technologies are competitive within their own
embedded class of hardware, there is still a way to go to reach HPC class GPUs.

description is technically a very difficult problem to handle. Textual
description of the same scene can vary greatly from person to person, or
sometimes even for the same person from time to time. As the choice of words
and syntax vary while preparing a textual description, it is challenging for
the system to reliably produce a consistently desirable output from different
forms of language input. The prior works of scene generation have been mostly
confined to rigorous sentence structures of text input which restrict the
freedom of users to write description. In our work, we study a new pipeline
that aims to generate static as well as animated 3D scenes from different types
of free-form textual scene description without any major restriction. In
particular, to keep our study practical and tractable, we focus on a small
subspace of all possible 3D scenes, containing various combinations of cube,
cylinder and sphere. We design a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we
encode the free-form text using an encoder-decoder neural architecture. In the
second stage, we generate a 3D scene based on the generated encoding. Our
neural architecture exploits state-of-the-art language model as encoder to
leverage rich contextual encoding and a new multi-head decoder to predict
multiple features of an object in the scene simultaneously. For our
experiments, we generate a large synthetic data-set which contains 13,00,000
and 14,00,000 samples of unique static and animated scene descriptions,
respectively. We achieve 98.427% accuracy on test data set in detecting the 3D
objects features successfully. Our work shows a proof of concept of one
approach towards solving the problem, and we believe with enough training data,
the same pipeline can be expanded to handle even broader set of 3D scene
generation problems.

We
introduce a new, unified framework for building intermittent demand forecasting
models, which incorporates and allows to generalize existing methods in several
directions. Our framework is based on extensions of well-established
model-based methods to discrete-time renewal processes, which can
parsimoniously account for patterns such as aging, clustering and
quasi-periodicity in demand arrivals. The connection to discrete-time renewal
processes allows not only for a principled extension of Croston-type models,
but also for an natural inclusion of neural network based models---by replacing
exponential smoothing with a recurrent neural network. We also demonstrate that
modeling continuous-time demand arrivals, i.e., with a temporal point process,
is possible via a trivial extension of our framework. This leads to more
flexible modeling in scenarios where data of individual purchase orders are
directly available with granular timestamps. Complementing this theoretical
advancement, we demonstrate the efficacy of our framework for forecasting
practice via an extensive empirical study on standard intermittent demand data
sets, in which we report predictive accuracy in a variety of scenarios that
compares favorably to the state of the art.

a computer controlled reflective phase-only spatial light modulator (SLM) to
adaptively tailor the input (and subsequent output) beam wavefront and
polarization in a few-mode fibre amplifier. In this way modal-coupling induced
beam distortion within the fibre amplifier can be mitigated and we are able to
generate at will any desired supported spatial mode guided in the fibre,

at large scales, but it is strongly damped at small scales ($\lesssim 1$Mpc)
owing to the stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback. The free-electron

valuable observable to derive mean densities of $\delta$ Scuti stars, due to
its independence with rotation. Up to now, theoretical studies of this
$\Delta\nu$-${\bar \rho}$ relation have been limited to 1D non-rotating models,
and 2D pseudo-evolutionary models. The present work aims at completing this
scenario by investigating quantitatively the impact of rotation in this
relation on a large grid of 1D asteroseismic models representative of $\delta$
Scuti stars. These include rotation effects on both the stellar evolution and
the interaction with pulsation. This allowed us to compute the stellar
deformation, get the polar and equatorial radii, and correct the stellar mean
densities. We found that the new $\Delta\nu$-${\bar \rho}$ relation for
rotating models is compatible with previous works. We explained the dispersion
of the points around the linear fits as caused mainly by the distribution of
the stellar mass, and partially by the evolutionary stage. The new fit is found
to be close to the previous theoretical studies for lower masses
($1.3-1.81\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$). However, the opposite holds for the
observations: for the higher masses ($1.81-3\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$) the fit is
more compatible with the empirical relation. We applied these results to
characterise the two well-known $\delta$ Scuti stars observed by CoRoT,
HD174936 and HD174966, and compared the physical parameters with those of
previous works. Inclusion of rotation in the modelling causes a tendency
towards greater masses, radii, luminosities and lower density values.
Comparison between $\Delta\nu$ and Gaia's luminosities also allowed us to
constraint the inclination angles and rotational velocities of both stars. The
present results pave the way to systematically constrain the angle of
inclination of $\delta$ Scuti stars

Currently, several methods are under development. It is of interest how a
possible candidate would behave and what would be the advantages and
disadvantages of a particular method. In this paper, we study a version of the
procedure. On the one hand side we analyze it based on the theory of
mathematical statistics. As a result, we present a statistically efficient

background magnetic-field formalism of Lattice QCD. In this investigation, the
chiral extrapolation of these lattice results is considered in a formalism
preserving the exact leading nonanalytic terms of chiral perturbation theory.
The $n_f = 2 + 1$ numerical simulations are electro-quenched, such that the
virtual sea-quarks of the QCD vacuum do not interact with the background field.
To understand the impact of this, we draw on partially quenched chiral
perturbation theory and identify the leading contributions of quark-flow
connected and disconnected diagrams. While electro-quenching does not impact
the leading-loop contribution to the magnetic polarizability, the loops which
generate the leading term have yet to be considered in lattice QCD simulations.
Lattice QCD results are used to constrain the analytic terms in the chiral
expansion and supplementing those with the two-loop result from chiral
perturbation theory enables an evaluation of the polarizability at the physical
quark mass. The resulting magnetic polarizability of the neutral pion is
$\beta_{\pi^0}=3.44(19)^{\rm stat}(37)^{\rm syst}\times 10^{-4}$ fm$^3$, which
lies just above the $1 \sigma$ error bound of the experimental measurement.

allowing for the creation of behavioral profiles and spotting possible

Understanding dynamics of leadership and followership, such as how leaders and

into group decision-making and collective behavior in general. However, given
only data of individual activities, it is challenging to infer the dynamics of
leaders and followers. In this paper, we focus on mining and modeling frequent
patterns of leading and following. We formalize new computational problems and
propose a framework that can be used to address several questions regarding
group movement. We use the leadership inference framework, mFLICA, to infer the
time series of leaders and their factions from movement datasets and then
propose an approach to mine and model frequent patterns of both leadership and
followership dynamics. We evaluate our framework performance by using several
simulated datasets, as well as the real-world dataset of baboon movement to
demonstrate the applications of our framework. These are novel computational
problems and, to the best of our knowledge, there are no existing comparable
methods to address them. Thus, we modify and extend an existing leadership
inference framework to provide a non-trivial baseline for comparison. Our
framework performs better than this baseline in all datasets. Our framework
opens the opportunities for scientists to generate testable scientific

equivalence arises because the Gram matrix formed by the inner product of

be written entirely in terms of this Gram matrix -- we do not need knowledge of
the underlying features. We define a tractable deep kernel process, the deep
inverse Wishart process, and give a doubly-stochastic inducing-point

superior performance to DGPs and infinite BNNs on standard fully-connected

and multimedia forensics over the last decade, these systems are still
vulnerable to attacks in real-life settings. Some of the challenges for
existing solutions are the detection of unknown attacks, the ability to perform
in adversarial settings, few-shot learning, and explainability. In this study,
these limitations are approached by reliance on a game-theoretic view for
modeling the interactions between the attacker and the detector. Consequently,
a new optimization criterion is proposed and a set of requirements are defined
for improving the performance of these systems in real-life settings.
Furthermore, a novel detection technique is proposed using generator-based
feature sets that are not biased towards any specific attack species. To
further optimize the performance on known attacks, a new loss function coined
categorical margin maximization loss (C-marmax) is proposed which gradually
improves the performance against the most powerful attack. The proposed
approach provides a more balanced performance across known and unknown attacks
and achieves state-of-the-art performance in known and unknown attack detection
cases against rational attackers. Lastly, the few-shot learning potential of
the proposed approach is studied as well as its ability to provide pixel-level
explainability.

diverse domains, e.g., IoT systems, health informatics, and 5G networks. To

consider unpredictable dynamics and highly variable lengths of these data but
also important to address the irregularities in the sampling rates of MTS.
Existing parametric approaches rely on manual hyperparameter tuning and may
cost a huge amount of labor effort. Therefore, it is desirable to learn the
representation automatically and efficiently. To this end, we propose an
autonomous representation learning approach for multivariate time series
(TimeAutoML) with irregular sampling rates and variable lengths. As opposed to
previous works, we first present a representation learning pipeline in which
the configuration and hyperparameter optimization are fully automatic and can
be tailored for various tasks, e.g., anomaly detection, clustering, etc. Next,
a negative sample generation approach and an auxiliary classification task are
developed and integrated within TimeAutoML to enhance its representation
capability. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets demonstrate that
the proposed TimeAutoML outperforms competing approaches on various tasks by a
large margin. In fact, it achieves the best anomaly detection performance among
all comparison algorithms on 78 out of all 85 UCR datasets, acquiring up to 20%
performance improvement in terms of AUC score.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) that use the four IRAC bands ($3.6, 4.5, 5.8$

source objects into CI and CII YSO candidates or as contaminants. We found that
ANNs can efficiently be applied to YSO classification with a contained number
of neurons ($\sim$ 25). Knowledge gathered on one star-forming region has shown
to be partly efficient for prediction in new regions. Best generalization
capacity was achieved using a combination of several star-forming regions to
train the network. Carefully rebalancing the training proportions was necessary
to achieve good results. We achieved above 90% and 97% recovery rate for CI and
CII YSOs, respectively, with precision above 80% and 90% for our most general
result. We took advantage of the ANN great flexibility to define, for each
object, an effective membership probability to each output class. Using a
threshold in this probability was found to efficiently improve the
classification results at a reasonable cost of object exclusion. With this
selection, we reached 90% precision on CI YSOs, for more than half of them. Our

for adversarial attacks for natural language processing (NLP) have attracted a
lot of research in recent years. However, most of the existing approaches focus
on classification problems. In this paper, we investigate attacks and defenses
for structured prediction tasks in NLP. Besides the difficulty of perturbing
discrete words and the sentence fluency problem faced by attackers in any NLP
tasks, there is a specific challenge to attackers of structured prediction
models: the structured output of structured prediction models is sensitive to
small perturbations in the input. To address these problems, we propose a novel
and unified framework that learns to attack a structured prediction model using
a sequence-to-sequence model with feedbacks from multiple reference models of
the same structured prediction task. Based on the proposed attack, we further
reinforce the victim model with adversarial training, making its prediction
more robust and accurate. We evaluate the proposed framework in dependency
parsing and part-of-speech tagging. Automatic and human evaluations show that
our proposed framework succeeds in both attacking state-of-the-art structured
prediction models and boosting them with adversarial training.

models and propose a light RGCN-based (RGCN, relational graph convolutional

to incorporate rich textual knowledge, we utilize a pre-trained NLP model to
initialize the embeddings of text nodes. Afterward, by performing a simplified
RGCN-based node information propagation on the constructed heterogeneous graph,
the embeddings of users and items can be adjusted with textual knowledge, which
effectively alleviates the negative effects of data sparsity. Moreover, the
matching function used by most graph-based representation learning methods is
the inner product, which is not appropriate for the obtained embeddings that
contain complex semantics. We design a predictive network that combines
graph-based representation learning with neural matching function learning, and
demonstrate that this architecture can bring a significant performance
improvement. Extensive experiments are conducted on three publicly available
datasets, and the results verify the superior performance of our method over

models perform much better than other models. Moreover, the EGARCH model's
asymmetric term is positive and insignificant, which suggests that Bitcoin
prices lack the asymmetric volatility response to past returns. Finally, we
formulate an option trading strategy by exploiting the volatility spread
between the GARCH volatility forecast and the option's implied volatility. We
show that a simple volatility-spread trading strategy with delta-hedging can
yield robust profits.

clusters at the sudden expansion of a microfluidic channel. A double emulsion
consisting of a regular train of coated microdroplets was created upstream of
the channel expansion, so that the inter-drop distance, droplet length,
velocity and coating thickness could be varied by imposing different inlet
pressures, albeit not independently. Provided that the enlarged channel remains
sufficiently confined to prohibit propagation in double file, droplets can
assemble sequentially into regular linear clusters at the expansion. Droplets
join a cluster via the coalescence of their coating film with that of the group
ahead. This coalescence occurs when the droplets approach each other to within
a critical distance at the expansion, enabled by hydrodynamic interactions
within the train. Clusters comprising a finite number of droplets are obtained
because reconfiguration of the droplet assembly during coalescence increases
the distance to the following droplet. Decreasing the inter-drop distance
increases the cluster size up to a maximum value beyond which continuous
clusters form. Formalising these observations in a simple model reveals that
clusters of any size are possible but that they occur for increasingly narrow
ranges of parameter values. Our experimental observations suggests that
background experimental fluctuations limit the maximum discrete cluster size in
practice. This method of self-assembly offers a robust alternative to flow
focusing for encapsulating multiple cores in a single coating film and the
potential to build more complex colloidal building blocks by de-confining the
clusters.

physics-informed deep learning model is presented for stochastic analysis in
heterogeneous porous material. Monte Carlo method based on a randomized
spectral representation is first employed to construct a stochastic model for
simulation of flow through porous media. To solve the governing equations for
stochastic groundwater flow problem, we build a modified NAS model based on
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with transfer learning in this paper
that will be able to fit different partial differential equations (PDEs) with
less calculation. The performance estimation strategies adopted is constructed
from an error estimation model using the method of manufactured solutions. A
sensitivity analysis is performed to obtain the prior knowledge of the PINNs
model and narrow down the range of parameters for search space and use
hyper-parameter optimization algorithms to further determine the values of the
parameters. Further the NAS based PINNs model also saves the weights and biases
of the most favorable architectures, then used in the fine-tuning process. It
is found that the log-conductivity field using Gaussian correlation function
will perform much better than exponential correlation case, which is more
fitted to the PINNs model and the modified neural architecture search based
PINNs model shows a great potential in approximating solutions to PDEs.
Moreover, a three dimensional stochastic flow model is built to provide a
benchmark to the simulation of groundwater flow in highly heterogeneous
aquifers. The NAS model based deep collocation method is verified to be
effective and accurate through numerical examples in different dimensions using
different manufactured solutions.

resonator is demonstrated experimentally. The proposed multimode sensing method
is implemented by recording wideband transmission spectra that consist of
multiple resonant modes. It is different from the previous dissipative sensing
scheme, which aims at measuring the transmission depth changes of a single
resonant mode in a microcavity. Here, by combining the dissipative sensing
mechanism and the machine learning algorithm, the multimode sensing information
extracted from a broadband spectrum can be efficiently fused to estimate the
target parameter. The multimode sensing method is immune to laser frequency
noises and robust against system imperfection, thus our work presents a great
step towards practical applications of microcavity sensors outside the research
laboratory. The voltage applied across the microheater on the chip was adjusted
to bring its influence on transmittance through the thermo-optic effects. As a
proof-of-principle experiment, the voltage was detected by the multimode
sensing approach. The experimental results demonstrate that the limit of
detection of the multimode sensing by the general regression neural network is
reduced to 6.7% of that of single-mode sensing within a large measuring range.

generation (asymptotically and on average), and thus the neutron population
decreases exponentially in the absence of external source. The chain reaction
is thus easy to stop, making such reactors inherently stable. Interestingly,
and contrary to common wisdom, there is no relation between keff, the external
source intensity, and the output power of the reactor. In this paper, I present
various possible strategies to exploit this fact, and apply them to the design
of a rudimentary multi-layer system that allows to reach an arbitrarily large
number of fissions per source neutron, while keeping keff < 1 fixed (I used
keff=0.97). The behavior of the amplifier is verified with simple Monte-Carlo
transport simulations. The proposal admittedly brings complications and
subtleties that need to be studied further, but, if developed, could allow to
drive subcritical reactors with faint neutron sources, e.g. radioisotope based.
