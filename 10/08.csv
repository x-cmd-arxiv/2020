directly, for the first time, $\langle x \rangle$ and $\langle x^2 \rangle$ for
the kaon using local operators. We use an ensemble of two degenerate light, a
strange and a charm quark ($N_f=2+1+1$) of maximally twisted mass fermions with
clover improvement. The quark masses are chosen so that they reproduce a pion
mass of about 260 MeV, and a kaon mass of 530 MeV. The lattice spacing of the
ensemble is 0.093 fm and the lattice has a spatial extent of 3 fm. We analyze
several values of the source-sink time separation within the range of
$1.12-2.23$ fm to study and eliminate excited-states contributions. The
necessary renormalization functions are calculated non-perturbatively in the
RI$'$ scheme, and are converted to the $\overline{\rm MS}$ scheme at a scale of
2 GeV. The final values for the momentum fraction are $\langle x

$\langle x^2 \rangle^K_{s^+}=0.134(5)_{\rm stat}(2)_{\rm syst}$. The reported
systematic uncertainties are due to excited-state contamination. We also give
the ratio $\langle x^2 \rangle/\langle x \rangle$ which is an indication of how

the web, including information retrieval, recommender systems, and metadata
annotation. Regardless of whether they are built manually by domain experts or
with automatic pipelines, KGs are often incomplete. Recent work has begun to
explore the use of textual descriptions available in knowledge graphs to learn
vector representations of entities in order to preform link prediction.
However, the extent to which these representations learned for link prediction
generalize to other tasks is unclear. This is important given the cost of
learning such representations. Ideally, we would prefer representations that do
not need to be trained again when transferring to a different task, while
retaining reasonable performance.
  In this work, we propose a holistic evaluation protocol for entity
representations learned via a link prediction objective. We consider the
inductive link prediction and entity classification tasks, which involve
entities not seen during training. We also consider an information retrieval
task for entity-oriented search. We evaluate an architecture based on a
pretrained language model, that exhibits strong generalization to entities not
observed during training, and outperforms related state-of-the-art methods (22%
MRR improvement in link prediction on average). We further provide evidence
that the learned representations transfer well to other tasks without
fine-tuning. In the entity classification task we obtain an average improvement
of 16% in accuracy compared with baselines that also employ pre-trained models.
In the information retrieval task, we obtain significant improvements of up to
8.8% in NDCG@10 for natural language queries. We thus show that the learned
representations are not limited KG-specific tasks, and have greater
generalization properties than evaluated in previous work.

statistical disclosure control (SDC), can be viewed under the lens of the
permutation model. According to this model, any SDC method for individual data
records is functionally equivalent to a permutation step plus a noise addition
step, where the noise added is marginal, in the sense that it does not alter
ranks. Here, we propose metrics to quantify the data confidentiality and
utility achieved by SDC methods based on the permutation model. We distinguish
two privacy notions: in our work, anonymity refers to subjects and hence mainly
to protection against record re-identification, whereas confidentiality refers
to the protection afforded to attribute values against attribute disclosure.
Thus, our confidentiality metrics are useful even if using a privacy model
ensuring an anonymity level ex ante. The utility metric is a general-purpose
metric that can be conveniently traded off against the confidentiality metrics,
because all of them are bounded between 0 and 1. As an application, we compare
the utility-confidentiality trade-offs achieved by several anonymization
approaches, including privacy models (k-anonymity and $\epsilon$-differential
privacy) as well as SDC methods (additive noise, multiplicative noise and
synthetic data) used without privacy models.

defined by its joint angles, poses are often best explained within several task
spaces. In many approaches, distributions within relevant task spaces are
learned independently and only combined at the control level. This
simplification implies several problems that are addressed in this work. We
show that the fusion of models in different task spaces can be expressed as a
product of experts (PoE), where the probabilities of the models are multiplied
and renormalized so that it becomes a proper distribution of joint angles.
Multiple experiments are presented to show that learning the different models
jointly in the PoE framework significantly improves the quality of the model.
The proposed approach particularly stands out when the robot has to learn
competitive or hierarchical objectives. Training the model jointly usually
relies on contrastive divergence, which requires costly approximations that can
affect performance. We propose an alternative strategy using variational
inference and mixture model approximations. In particular, we show that the
proposed approach can be extended to PoE with a nullspace structure (PoENS),
where the model is able to recover tasks that are masked by the resolution of

setting exhibits phenomena that cannot be expected for global actions, usually
stemming from the fact that virtually all averaging arguments for finite group

algebra and crossed product are not in general Morita equivalent, and there is
in general no local approximation of the crossed product $A\rtimes G$ by
matrices over $A$. By using decomposition arguments for partial actions of
finite groups, we show that a number of structural properties are preserved by
formation of crossed products, including finite stable rank, finite nuclear
dimension, and absorption of a strongly self-absorbing $C^*$-algebra. For
partial actions with the Rokhlin property, being an AF-algebra is also
preserved. Some of our results are new even in the global case.
  We also study the Rokhlin dimension of globalizable actions: while in general
it differs from the Rokhlin dimension of its globalization, we show that they
agree if the coefficient algebra is unital. For topological partial actions on

we present Abductive Meta-Interpretive Learning ($Meta_{Abd}$) that unites
abduction and induction to learn neural networks and induce logic theories

$Meta_{Abd}$ is the first system that can jointly learn neural networks from

challenges in protein engineering; by knowing the effect a substitution of one
(or several) residues in the protein's sequence has on its overall properties,
could design a variant with a desirable function. New strategies and
methodologies to create predictive models are continually being developed.
However, those that claim to be general often do not reach adequate
performance, and those that aim to a particular task improve their predictive
performance at the cost of the method's generality. Moreover, these approaches
typically require a particular decision to encode the amino acidic sequence,
without an explicit methodological agreement in such endeavor. To address these
issues, in this work, we applied clustering, embedding, and dimensionality
reduction techniques to the AAIndex database to select meaningful combinations
of physicochemical properties for the encoding stage. We then used the chosen
set of properties to obtain several encodings of the same sequence, to
subsequently apply the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on them. We perform an
exploratory stage of Machine-Learning models in the frequency space, using
different algorithms and hyperparameters. Finally, we select the best
performing predictive models in each set of properties and create an assembled
model. We extensively tested the proposed methodology on different datasets and
demonstrated that the generated assembled model achieved notably better
performance metrics than those models based on a single encoding and, in most
cases, better than those previously reported. The proposed method is available

suggest why the close-to-integrable behavior of the FPU chain (the FPU paradox)

also how a breakdown of integrability (detachment from the KdV hierarchy) may
responsible for the eventual thermalization of the system.

our approach provides substantial gains compared to the previous state of the

show that the strong SOC in HoSbTe fully gaps out the nodal lines and drives
the system to a weak topological insulator state, with each layer being a
two-dimensional topological insulator. Because of the strong SOC in HoSbTe, the
gap is as large as hundreds of meV along specific directions, which is directly

resonance seeded by the periodic structure at the first stage amplifies the
perturbations of both fields inside the Hubble radius. While the evolution of
the background trajectory experiences a turn as the oscillatory barrier height

stellar initial mass function (IMF) is still debated. Particularly crucial is
the question of what sets the peak of the distribution. To investigate this
issue we perform high resolution numerical simulations with radiative feedback
exploring in particular the role of the stellar and accretion luminosities. We
also perform simulations with a simple effective equation of state (eos) and we
investigate 1000 solar mass clumps having respectively 0.1 and 0.4 pc of
initial radii. We found that most runs, both with radiative transfer or an eos,
present similar mass spectra with a peak broadly located around 0.3-0.5
M$_\odot$ and a powerlaw-like mass distribution at higher masses. However, when
accretion luminosity is accounted for, the resulting mass spectrum of the most
compact clump tends to be moderately top-heavy. The effect remains limited for
the less compact one, which overall remains colder. Our results support the
idea that rather than the radiative stellar feedback, this is the transition
from the isothermal to the adiabatic regime, which occurs at a gas density of
about 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, that is responsible for setting the peak of the
initial mass function. This stems for the fact that $i)$ extremely compact
clumps for which the accretion luminosity has a significant influence are very
rare and $ii)$ because of the luminosity problem, which indicates that the
effective accretion luminosity is likely weaker than expected.

extensive sample preparation by multi-step lithography. To enable rapid

theoretical predictions using the binary-alloy series Au$_x$Pt$_{1-x}$ as

performance in improving generalization and data efficiency in various NLP

van der Pauw methods were utilized for determining 2D $\rho$ in the film plane.
The samples were prepared by normal incidence sputter deposition within an
in-situ magnetic field to induce in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in the
film. Since $\rho$ might be affected by the internal magnetization of the film,
we performed measurements by rotation of a saturating magnetic field in the
film plane. Both methods indicate that the average resistivity is lower along
the easy axis of the film compared to the hard axis. Since X-ray diffraction
results indicated no dominating texture in the film, we concluded that there is
a correlation between uniaxial magnetic axes and principal resistivity axes.
This is an important finding that allows determining the direction of magnetic
anisotropy axes without magnetometry. The results also verify atomic or pair
ordering to be the origin of uniaxial magnetic anisotropy in the Py since
resistivity is sensitive to the level of order in solids. The extended van der
Pauw utilized here can be easily performed on the as-received samples which is

binary with an orbital period less than ten minutes. The system likely consists
of two low-mass white dwarfs, and will merge in approximately 400,000 years to
form either an isolated hot subdwarf or an R Coronae Borealis star. Like its

strongest gravitational wave sources detectable by the space-based
gravitational-wave detector The Laser Space Interferometer Antenna (LISA)
because its gravitational-wave frequency falls near the peak of LISA's
sensitivity. Based on its estimated distance of $d=2120^{+131}_{-115}\,\rm pc$,
LISA should detect the source within its first few months of operation, and
should achieve a signal-to-noise ratio of $87\pm5$ after four years. We find
component masses of $M_A= 0.349^{+0.093}_{-0.074}\,M_\odot$ and

crossing in front of and behind their host stars. Here, we provide estimates of
the random noise sources affecting JWST NIRCam time-series data on the
integration-to-integration level. We find that 1/f noise can limit the
precision of grism time series for 2 groups (230 ppm to 1000 ppm depending on
the extraction method and extraction parameters), but will average down like
the square root of N frames/reads. The current NIRCam grism time series mode is
especially affected by 1/f noise because its GRISMR dispersion direction is
parallel to the detector fast-read direction, but could be alleviated in the
GRISMC direction. Care should be taken to include as many frames as possible
per visit to reduce this 1/f noise source: thus, we recommend the smallest
detector subarray sizes one can tolerate, 4 output channels and readout modes
that minimize the number of skipped frames (RAPID or BRIGHT2). We also describe
a covariance weighting scheme that can significantly lower the contributions
from 1/f noise as compared to sum extraction. We evaluate the noise introduced

fields, all of which also exhibit intense [OIII]$+$H$\beta$ emission (EW$>$800

strong in a subset of massive z$\simeq$7$-$9 galaxies, we have initiated an
MMT/Binospec survey targeting a larger sample (N=22) of similarly luminous
($\simeq$1$-$6 L$^{\ast}_{\mathrm{UV}}$) z$\simeq$7 galaxies selected over very
wide-area fields ($\sim$3 deg$^2$). We confidently ($>$7$\sigma$) detect
Ly$\alpha$ in 78% (7/9) of galaxies with strong [OIII]$+$H$\beta$ emission
(EW$>$800 $\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$) as opposed to only 8% (1/12) of galaxies
with more moderate (EW=200$-$800 $\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$) [OIII]$+$H$\beta$. We
argue that the higher Ly$\alpha$ EWs of the strong [OIII]$+$H$\beta$ population
likely reflect enhanced ionizing photon production efficiency owing to their
large sSFRs ($\gtrsim$30 Gyr$^{-1}$). We also find evidence that Ly$\alpha$
transmission from massive galaxies declines less rapidly over $6<z<7$ than in
low-mass lensed systems. In particular, our data suggest no strong evolution in
Ly$\alpha$ transmission, consistent with a picture wherein massive z$\simeq$7

closely-separated ($R$ = 1.7 physical Mpc) z$\simeq$7 Ly$\alpha$ emitters in

gaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus
allowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of
future precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to
high dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle
number density in the simulated volume. The GADGET-4 code is publicly released

physics, such as a phase transition or parametric resonance, is largely fixed

this low frequency end of the spectrum is analyzed with an emphasis on a
physical understanding, such as the suppressed production of gravitational
waves due to the excitation of an over-damped harmonic oscillator and their
enhancement due to being frozen out while outside the horizon. Due to the
difference between sub-horizon and super-horizon physics, it is inevitable that
there will be a distinct spectral feature that could allow for the direct
measurement of the conformal Hubble rate at which the phase transition
occurred. As an example, free-streaming particles (such as the gravity waves
themselves) present during the phase transition affect the production of
super-horizon modes. This leads to a steeper decrease in the spectrum at low
frequencies as compared to the well-known causal $k^3$ super-horizon scaling of
stochastic gravity waves. If a sizable fraction of the energy density is in
free-streaming particles, they even lead to the appearance of oscillatory
features in the spectrum. If the universe was not radiation dominated when the
waves were generated, a similar feature also occurs at the transition between
sub-horizon to super-horizon causality. These features are used to show
surprising consequences, such as the fact that a period of matter domination
following the production of gravity waves actually increases their power
spectrum at low frequencies.

fermionic dark matter due to their high observed dark matter phase-space
density. In this work, we review, revise and improve upon previous phase-space
considerations to obtain lower bounds on the mass of fermionic dark matter
particles. The refinement in the results compared to previous works is realised
particularly due to a significantly improved Jeans analysis of the galaxies. We
discuss two methods to obtain phase-space bounds on the dark matter mass, one
model-independent bound based on Pauli's principle, and the other derived from
an application of Liouville's theorem. As benchmark examples for the latter
case, we derive constraints for thermally decoupled particles and
(non-)resonantly produced sterile neutrinos. Using the Pauli principle, we
report a model-independent lower bound of $m \geq 0.18\,\mathrm{keV}$ at 68% CL
and $m \geq 0.13\,\mathrm{keV}$ at 95% CL. For relativistically decoupled
thermal relics, this bound is strengthened to $m \geq 0.59\,\mathrm{keV}$ at
68% CL and $m \geq 0.41\,\mathrm{keV}$ at 95% CL, whilst for non-resonantly
produced sterile neutrinos the constraint is $m \geq 2.80\,\mathrm{keV}$ at 68%
CL and $m \geq 1.74\,\mathrm{keV}$ at 95% CL. Finally, the phase-space bounds
on resonantly produced sterile neutrinos are compared with complementary limits
from X-ray, Lyman-$\alpha$ and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis observations.

supersymmetry are notoriously difficult to achieve. Given that sequestering
requires very specific configurations, supersymmetric particles are in general
expected to be very heavy implying that the neutralino dark matter should be
overproduced in a standard thermal history. However, in this paper we point out
that this is generically not the case since early matter domination driven by
string moduli can dilute the dark matter abundance down to the observed value.
We argue that generic features of string compactifications, namely a high
supersymmetry breaking scale and late time epochs of modulus domination, might
imply superheavy neutralino dark matter with mass around $10^{10}-10^{11}$ GeV.
Interestingly, this is the right range to explain the recent detection of
ultra-high-energy neutrinos by IceCube and ANITA via dark matter decay.

that pointing jitter and high gain antenna moves on top of the detectors'
subpixel crosshatch patterns will produce relatively small variations (less
than 6 parts per million, ppm). The time-dependent aperture losses due to
thermal instabilities in the optics can also be kept to below 2 ppm. To achieve
these low noise sources, it is important to employ a sufficiently large (more
than 1.1 arcseconds) extraction aperture. Persistence due to charge trapping
will have a minor (less than 3 ppm) effect on time series 20 minutes into an
exposure and is expected to play a much smaller role than it does for the HST
WFC3 detectors. We expect temperature fluctuations to be less than 3 ppm. In
total, our estimated noise floor from known systematic error sources is only 9
ppm per visit. We do however urge caution as unknown systematic error sources

mass $M_*$, star formation rate (SFR), specific SFR (sSFR), molecular gas mass
$M_{\rm H_2}$, star formation efficiency (SFE) of the molecular gas and
molecular gas to stellar mass ratio $\mu$. We aim to identify the most
fundamental scaling relations among these key galaxy properties and their
interrelationships. We show the integrated $M_{\rm H_2}$-SFR, SFR-$M_*$ and
$M_{\rm H_2}$-$M_*$ relation can be simply transformed from the $\mu$-sSFR,
SFE-$\mu$ and SFE-sSFR relation, respectively. The transformation, in
principle, can increase or decrease the scatter of each relation.
Interestingly, we find the latter three relations all have significantly
smaller scatter than the former three corresponding relations. We show the
probability to achieve the observed small scatter by accident is extremely
close to zero. This suggests that the smaller scatters of the latter three
relations are driven by a more fundamental physical connection among these
quantities. We then show the large scatters in the former relations are due to
their systematic dependence on other galaxy properties, and on star formation
and quenching process. We propose the sSFR-$\mu$-SFE relation as the
Fundamental Formation Relation (FFR), which governs the star formation and
quenching process, and provides a simple framework to study galaxy evolution.
Other scaling relations, including integrated Kennicutt-Schmidt law,
star-forming main sequence and molecular gas main sequence, can all be derived

average differences smaller than $\sim$10$\%$, posing a strong limit on the

studying the hydrostatic bias. The mean ratio between our X-ray masses and the
weak-lensing masses in the LC$^2$-single catalog is 1-$b$=0.74$\pm$0.06.
However, the mean mass ratios inferred from the WL masses of different projects
vary by a large amount, with APEX-SZ showing a bias consistent with zero

the dynamical mass measurements show better agreement with the X-ray
hydrostatic masses, although there are significant differences when relaxed or

nuclear gamma lines produced by the coupling between matter and the nuclei in
the source or absorber of a Mossbauer spectrometer. Remarkably, such energy
shifts are rather insensitive to electromagnetic interactions that represent
the largest background in searches for new forces using atomic matter. This is
because nuclei are intrinsically shielded by the electron clouds. Additionally,
electromagnetic interactions cause energy shifts by coupling to nuclear moments
that are suppressed by the size of the nuclei, while new scalar interactions
can directly affect these shifts. Finally, averaging over unpolarized nuclei,
further reduces electromagnetic interactions. We discuss several possible
configurations, using the traditional Mossbauer effect as well as nuclear
resonant absorption driven by synchrotron radiation. For this purpose, we

intra-valley inversion symmetry. Writing the flatband wavefunction as a product
of a lowest Landau level quantum Hall state and a spinor, we show that the
components of the spinor are anti-quantum Hall wavefunctions related by the
inversion symmetry operation introduced here. We then show numerically that as
one moves from the lowest to higher magic angles, the spinor components of the
wavefunction exhibit an increasing number of zeros, resembling the changes in
the quantum Hall wavefunction as the Landau level index is increased. The
wavefunction zeros are characterized by a chirality, with zeros of the same
chirality clustering near the center of the moire unit cell, while opposite
chirality zeros are pushed to the boundaries of the unit cell. The enhanced
phase winding at higher magic angles suggests an increased circulating current.
Physical implications for scanning tunneling spectroscopy, orbital

for weak non-quantizing magnetic fields, a sufficiently strong finite
intervalley scattering drives the system to switch the sign of LMC from
positive to negative. Here we unravel another independent source that produces
the same effect. Specifically, a smooth lattice cutoff to the linear
dispersion, which is ubiquitous in real Weyl materials, introduces nonlinearity
in the problem and also drives the system to exhibit negative LMC for
non-collinear electric and magnetic fields even in the limit of vanishing
intervalley scattering. We examine longitudinal magnetoconductivity and the
planar Hall effect semi-analytically for a lattice model of tilted Weyl
fermions within the Boltzmann approximation. We independently study the effects
of a finite lattice cutoff and tilt parameters and construct phase diagrams in
relevant parameter spaces that are relevant for diagnosing chiral anomaly in

  Issue 2, Article 6","10.22152/programming-journal.org/2022/6/6",,"cs.PL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many object-oriented dynamic languages allow programmers to _extract methods_
from objects and treat them as functions. This allows for flexible programming
patterns, but presents challenges for type systems. In particular, a simple
treatment of method extraction would require methods to be contravariant in the
receiver type, making overriding all-but-impossible. We present a detailed
investigation of this problem, as well as an implemented and evaluated
solution. Method extraction is a feature of many dynamically-typed and
gradually-typed languages, ranging from Python and PHP to Flow and TypeScript.
In these languages, the underlying representation of objects as records of
procedures can be accessed, and the procedures that implement methods can be
reified as functions that can be called independently. In many of these
languages, the programmer can then explicitly specify the `this` value to be
used when the method implementation is called. Unfortunately, as we show,
existing gradual type systems such as TypeScript and Flow are unsound in the
presence of method extraction. The problem for typing any such system is that
the flexibility it allows must be tamed by requiring a connection between the
object the method was extracted from, and the function value that is later
called. In Racket, where a method extraction-like facility, dubbed ""structure
type properties"", is fundamental to classes, generic methods, and other APIs,
these same challenges arise, and must be solved to support this feature in
Typed Racket. We show how to combine two existing type system features --
existential types and occurrence typing -- to produce a sound approach to
typing method extraction. We formalize our design, extending an existing formal
model of the Typed Racket type system, and prove that our extension is sound.
Our design is also implemented in the released version of Racket, and is
compatible with all existing Typed Racket packages, many of which already used
a previous version of this feature.

we have limited ability to detect gas at low relative velocities in the
extended Galactic halo because those spectral lines are blended with much
stronger signals from dense foreground gas. As a result, the content of the
Milky Way's circumgalactic medium (CGM) is poorly constrained at $|v_{\rm
LSR}|$ $\lesssim$ 150 km s$^{-1}$. To overcome this complication, the QuaStar
Survey applies a spectral differencing technique using paired quasar-star
sightlines to measure the obscured content of the Milky Way's CGM for the first
time. We present measurements of the CIV doublet ($\lambda\lambda$ 1548 \r{A},
1550 \r{A}), a rest-frame UV metal line transition detected in HST/COS spectra
of 30 halo-star/quasar pairs evenly distributed across the sky at Galactic
latitudes $|b|>30^\circ$. The 30 halo stars have well-constrained distances
(d$\approx$5-14 kpc), and are paired with quasars separated by $<$ 2.8$^\circ$.
We argue that the difference in absorption between the quasar and stellar
sightlines originates primarily in the Milky Way's extended CGM beyond $\sim$10
kpc. For the Milky Way's extended, low velocity CGM ($|v|<$150 km/s), we place
an upper limit on the mean CIV column density of $\rm \Delta logN_{LVCGM} <
13.39$ and find a covering fraction of $f_{\rm CIV,LVCGM} (\rm logN>13.65)=$
20% [6/30], a value significantly lower than the covering fraction for
star-forming galaxies at low redshift. Our results suggest either that the bulk
of Milky Way's CIV-traced CGM lies at low Galactic latitudes, or that the Milky
Way's CGM is lacking in warm, ionized material compared to low-redshift ($z <
0.1$) star-forming galaxy halos.

containing molecules, non-covalent interactions, and transition-state energies.
MOB-ML requires training data from only 1% of the QM7b-T data set (i.e., only
70 organic molecules with seven and fewer heavy atoms) to predict the total
energy of the remaining 99% of this data set with sub-kcal/mol accuracy. This
MOB-ML model is significantly more accurate than other methods when transferred
to a data set comprised of thirteen heavy atom molecules, exhibiting no loss of
accuracy on a size intensive (i.e., per-electron) basis. It is shown that
MOB-ML also works well for extrapolating to transition-state structures,
predicting the barrier region for malonaldehyde intramolecular proton-transfer
to within 0.35 kcal/mol when only trained on reactant/product-like structures.
Finally, the use of the Gaussian process variance enables an active learning
strategy for extending MOB-ML model to new regions of chemical space with
minimal effort. We demonstrate this active learning strategy by extending a
QM7b-T model to describe non-covalent interactions in the protein
backbone-backbone interaction data set to an accuracy of 0.28 kcal/mol.

approaches, corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations in order to elucidate the

only if their masses can be correctly inferred from observations. In
particular, X-ray and Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect observations can be used to
derive masses within the framework of the hydrostatic equilibrium. Therefore,
it is crucial to have a good control of the possible mass biases that can be
introduced when this hypothesis is not valid. In this work, we analyzed a set
of 260 synthetic clusters from the MUSIC simulation project, at redshifts $0
\leq z \leq 0.82$. We estimate the hydrostatic mass of the MUSIC clusters from
X-ray only (temperature and density) and from X-ray and SZ (density and
pressure). Then, we compare them with the true 3D dynamical mass. The biases
are of the order of 20%. We find that using the temperature instead of the
pressure leads to a smaller bias, although the two values are compatible within
1$\sigma$. Non-thermal contributions to the total pressure support, arising
from bulk motion and turbulence of the gas, are also computed and show that
they are sufficient to account for this bias. We also present a study of the
correlation between the mass bias and the dynamical state of the clusters. A
clear correlation is shown between the relaxation state of the clusters and the
bias factor. We applied the same analysis on a subsample of 32 objects, already

address issues specific to the domain of medical image analysis, such as 3-D
data handling and distance metrics for evaluation. pymia, an open-source Python
package, tries to address these issues by providing flexible data handling and
evaluation independent of the deep learning framework.
  Methods: The pymia package provides data handling and evaluation
functionalities. The data handling allows flexible medical image handling in
every commonly used format (e.g., 2-D, 2.5-D, and 3-D; full- or patch-wise).
Even data beyond images like demographics or clinical reports can easily be
integrated into deep learning pipelines. The evaluation allows stand-alone
result calculation and reporting, as well as performance monitoring during
training using a vast amount of domain-specific metrics for segmentation,
reconstruction, and regression.
  Results: The pymia package is highly flexible, allows for fast prototyping,
and reduces the burden of implementing data handling routines and evaluation
methods. While data handling and evaluation are independent of the deep
learning framework used, they can easily be integrated into TensorFlow and
PyTorch pipelines. The developed package was successfully used in a variety of
research projects for segmentation, reconstruction, and regression.
  Conclusions: The pymia package fills the gap of current deep learning
frameworks regarding data handling and evaluation in medical image analysis. It
is available at https://github.com/rundherum/pymia and can directly be
installed from the Python Package Index using pip install pymia.

  conditions",,,,,"physics.class-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Attenuation in acoustic waveguides with lossy impedance boundary conditions
are associated with non-Hermitian and non-normal operators. This subject has
been extensively studied in fundamental and engineering research, and it has
been traditionally assumed that the attenuation behavior of total sound power
can be totally captured by considering the decay of each transverse mode
individually. One of the classical tools in this context is the Cremer optimum
concept that aims to maximize the attenuation of the least attenuated mode.
However, a typical sound field may be a superposition of a large number of
transverse modes which are nonorthogonal, and the individual mode attenuation
may have little to do with the total sound power attenuation. By using singular
value decomposition, we link the least attenuated total sound power to the
maximum singular value of the non-normal propagator. The behaviors of the least
attenuated total sound power depend only on the lossy boundary conditions and
frequency, but are independent of sources. The sound may be almost non-decaying
along the waveguide transition region for any lossy impedance boundary
conditions although all modes attenuate exponentially. This spatial transient
appears particularly strongly if the impedance is close to an exceptional point
of the propagator, at which a pair of adjacent modes achieve maximum
attenuation predicted by Cremer optimum concept. These results are confirmed
using non-modal numerical calculations and a two-by-two toy model.

between the displacement predicted by the FE model and full-field digital image

the forward and inverse problems are obtained by appropriately seeding and
evaluating these quantities. We present three numerical examples that verify

of CR component enhances the growth of dynamo slightly. We further compute the
underlying dynamo coefficients using the test-fields method, and argue that the

planet formation may already be underway in even younger disks in the Class I
phase, when the protostar is still embedded in a larger scale dense envelope of
gas and dust. While younger disks likely play an important role in the onset of
planet formation, only within the past decade have detailed properties of disks

with higher overall performance due to better-unlabeled data representations.
Nonetheless, recent research suggests that the performance of the SSL algorithm
can be degraded when the unlabeled set contains out-of-distribution examples
(OODs). This work addresses the following question: How do out-of-distribution
(OOD) data adversely affect semi-supervised learning algorithms? To answer this
question, we investigate the critical causes of OOD's negative effect on SSL
algorithms. In particular, we found that 1) certain kinds of OOD data instances
that are close to the decision boundary have a more significant impact on
performance than those that are further away, and 2) Batch Normalization (BN),
a popular module, may degrade rather than improve performance when the
unlabeled set contains OODs. In this context, we developed a unified weighted
robust SSL framework that can be easily extended to many existing SSL
algorithms and improve their robustness against OODs. More specifically, we
developed an efficient bi-level optimization algorithm that could accommodate
high-order approximations of the objective and scale to multiple inner
optimization steps to learn a massive number of weight parameters while
outperforming existing low-order approximations of bi-level optimization.
Further, we conduct a theoretical study of the impact of faraway OODs in the BN
step and propose a weighted batch normalization (WBN) procedure for improved
performance. Finally, we discuss the connection between our approach and
low-order approximation techniques. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world

jointly optimize a grid-level objective, while satisfying each TCL's end-use

grid-scale problem into subproblems and coordinate their solutions to find the
global optimum using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM).
The TCLs' local problems are distributed to and computed in parallel at each
TCL, making COHORT highly scalable and privacy-preserving. While each TCL poses
combinatorial and non-convex constraints, we characterize these constraints as
a convex set through relaxation, thereby making COHORT computationally viable
over long planning horizons. After coordination, each TCL is responsible for
its own control and tracks the agreed-upon power trajectory with its preferred
strategy. In this work, we translate continuous power back to discrete on/off
actuation, using pulse width modulation. COHORT is generalizable to a wide
range of grid objectives, which we demonstrate through three distinct use
cases: generation following, minimizing ramping, and peak load curtailment. In
a notable experiment, we validated our approach through a hardware-in-the-loop
simulation, including a real-world air conditioner (AC) controlled via a smart
thermostat, and simulated instances of ACs modeled after real-world data
traces. During the 15-day experimental period, COHORT reduced daily peak loads

there is still no major breakthrough. In practice, an exhaustive search over
all possible techniques and hyperparameters is needed to find optimal
fairness-accuracy trade-offs. Hence, coupled with the lack of tools for ML
practitioners, real-world adoption of bias reduction methods is still scarce.
To address this, we present Fairband, a bandit-based fairness-aware
hyperparameter optimization (HO) algorithm. Fairband is conceptually simple,
resource-efficient, easy to implement, and agnostic to both the objective
metrics, model types and the hyperparameter space being explored. Moreover, by
introducing fairness notions into HO, we enable seamless and efficient
integration of fairness objectives into real-world ML pipelines. We compare
Fairband with popular HO methods on four real-world decision-making datasets.
We show that Fairband can efficiently navigate the fairness-accuracy trade-off
through hyperparameter optimization. Furthermore, without extra training cost,
it consistently finds configurations attaining substantially improved fairness
at a comparatively small decrease in predictive accuracy.

formulate the inference problem as an optimal control problem where the
objective is to minimize the discrepancy between observed data and an
approximate solution of the model, and the control variables are the fractional

who has partial knowledge of data distribution, SHS model, and ML algorithm to
perform both targeted and untargeted attacks. Employing these adversarial
capabilities, we manipulate medical device readings to alter patient status
(disease-affected, normal condition, activities, etc.) in the outcome of the
SHS. Our attack utilizes five different adversarial ML algorithms (HopSkipJump,
Fast Gradient Method, Crafting Decision Tree, Carlini & Wagner, Zeroth Order

misclassify outputs, etc.) on a SHS. Moreover, based on the training and
testing phase capabilities of an adversary, we perform white box and black box
attacks on a SHS. We evaluate the performance of our work in different SHS

can make predictions within seconds in a single forward pass on an ordinary

a polymer matrix filled with a mixture of magnetically soft and magnetically
hard spherical particles, is considered. The object we focus at is an
elementary unit of this composite, for which we take a set consisting of a
permanent spherical micromagnet surrounded by an elastomer layer filled with
magnetically soft microparticles. We present a comparative treatment of this
unit from two essentially different viewpoints. The first one is a
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation model, which presents the
composite as a bead-spring assembly and is able to deliver information of all
the microstructural changes of the assembly. The second approach is entirely
based on the continuum magnetomechanical description of the system, whose
direct yield is the macroscopic field-induced response of the MAE to external
field, as this model ignores all the microstructural details of the
magnetization process. We find that, differing in certain details, both
frameworks are coherent in predicting that a unit comprising magnetically soft
and hard particles may display a non-trivial re-entrant
(prolate/oblate/prolate) axial deformation under variation of the applied field
strength.
  The flexibility of the proposed combination of the two complementary
frameworks enables us to look deeper into the manifestation of the magnetic
response: with respect to the magnetically soft particles, we compare the
linear regime of magnetization to that with saturation, which we describe by
the Fr\""{o}hlich-Kennelly approximation; with respect to the polymer matrix, we
analyze the dependence of the re-rentrant deformation on its rigidity.

logarithmic flat connections on principal $G$-bundles, where $G$ is a complex
reductive structure group. Flat connections on the affine line with a
logarithmic singularity at the origin are equivalent to representations of a
groupoid associated to the exponentiated action of $\mathbb{C}$. We show that
such representations admit a canonical Jordan-Chevalley decomposition and use
this to give a functorial classification. Flat connections on a complex
manifold with logarithmic singularities along a hypersurface are equivalent to
representations of a twisted fundamental groupoid. Using a Morita equivalence,
whose construction is inspired by Deligne's notion of paths with tangential
basepoints, we prove a van Kampen type theorem for this groupoid. This allows
us to show that the category of representations of the twisted fundamental
groupoid can be localized to the normal bundle of the hypersurface. As a
result, we obtain a functorial Riemann-Hilbert correspondence for logarithmic
connections in terms of generalized monodromy data.

(pre-train a foundation model on a large dataset in a self-supervised manner,
and subsequently fine-tune it for different downstream tasks) leads to
task-specific models that are highly over-parameterized, adversely impacting
both accuracy and inference efficiency. We propose AxFormer, a systematic
framework that applies accuracy-driven approximations to create optimized
transformer models for a given downstream task. AxFormer combines two key
optimizations -- accuracy-driven pruning and selective hard attention.
Accuracy-driven pruning identifies and removes parts of the fine-tuned
transformer that hinder performance on the given downstream task. Sparse
hard-attention optimizes attention blocks in selected layers by eliminating
irrelevant word aggregations, thereby helping the model focus only on the
relevant parts of the input. In effect, AxFormer leads to models that are more
accurate, while also being faster and smaller. Our experiments on GLUE and
SQUAD tasks show that AxFormer models are up to 4.5% more accurate, while also
being up to 2.5X faster and up to 3.2X smaller than conventional fine-tuned
models. In addition, we demonstrate that AxFormer can be combined with previous
efforts such as distillation or quantization to achieve further efficiency
gains.

cluster data that is supported on a union of linear subspaces, with each
subspace defining a cluster with dimension lower than the ambient space. Many
existing formulations for this problem are based on exploiting the
self-expressive property of linear subspaces, where any point within a subspace
can be represented as linear combination of other points within the subspace.
To extend this approach to data supported on a union of non-linear manifolds,
numerous studies have proposed learning an embedding of the original data using
a neural network which is regularized by a self-expressive loss function on the
data in the embedded space to encourage a union of linear subspaces prior on
the data in the embedded space. Here we show that there are a number of
potential flaws with this approach which have not been adequately addressed in
prior work. In particular, we show the model formulation is often ill-posed in
that it can lead to a degenerate embedding of the data, which need not
correspond to a union of subspaces at all and is poorly suited for clustering.
We validate our theoretical results experimentally and also repeat prior
experiments reported in the literature, where we conclude that a significant
portion of the previously claimed performance benefits can be attributed to an
ad-hoc post processing step rather than the deep subspace clustering model.

quantization errors due to the DM electronics on the image contrast using
experimental data from the High Contrast Imaging Testbed (HCIT) facility at
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). We find that the simplest analytical

However, we also find that end-to-end numerical simulations of the wavefront

exoplanets around Solar-type stars at wavelengths as small as 450nm with
coronagraph instruments on future space telescopes. Finally, we list the

proposed to solve this problem, from conventional rulebased or statistical
slot-filling systems to shiftreduce based neural parsers. For complex parsing
tasks, the state-of-the-art method is based on autoregressive sequence to
sequence models to generate the parse directly. This model is slow at inference
time, generating parses in O(n) decoding steps (n is the length of the target
sequence). In addition, we demonstrate that this method performs poorly in
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer learning settings. In this paper, we propose a
non-autoregressive parser which is based on the insertion transformer to
overcome these two issues. Our approach 1) speeds up decoding by 3x while
outperforming the autoregressive model and 2) significantly improves
cross-lingual transfer in the low-resource setting by 37% compared to
autoregressive baseline. We test our approach on three well-known monolingual
datasets: ATIS, SNIPS and TOP. For cross lingual semantic parsing, we use the

fairly well overall description of light cluster and neutron emission is
obtained and detailed discrepancies with respect to the experimental results

this fragility for Al-flux grown Sm$_{1-x}$Gd$_{x}$B$_{6}$ single crystals (0

Previous studies of galaxy HI deficiency using HIPASS were sensitive to
galaxies that are extremely HI rich or poor. We use an updated binning
statistic for measuring the global sky distribution of HI deficiency that is
sensitive to the average deficiencies. Our analysis confirms the result from
previous studies that galaxies residing in denser environments, such as Virgo,
are on average more HI deficient than galaxies at lower densities. However,
many other individual groups and clusters are not found to be on average
significantly HI poor, in contradiction to previous work. In terms of HI
spectral asymmetries, we do not recover any significant trend of increasing
asymmetry with environment density as found for other galaxy samples. We also
investigate the correlation between HI asymmetry and deficiency, but find no
variation in the mean asymmetry of galaxies that are HI rich, normal or poor.
This indicates that there is either no dependence of asymmetry on HI
deficiency, or a galaxy's HI deficiency only has a small influence on the

propose a method to simplify the prediction explanation of One-Dimensional (1D)

received considerable attention due to their good performance. However, because
the $l_{2,0}$-norm regularization term is non-convex, this problem is very hard
to solve. In this paper, unlike most of the other methods which only solve the
approximate problem, a novel method based on homotopy iterative hard threshold
(HIHT) is proposed to solve the $l_{2,0}$-norm regularization least square
problem directly for multi-class feature selection, which can produce exact
row-sparsity solution for the weights matrix. What'more, in order to reduce the
computational time of HIHT, an acceleration version of HIHT (AHIHT) is derived.
Extensive experiments on eight biological datasets show that the proposed
method can achieve higher classification accuracy (ACC) with fewest number of
selected features (No.fea) comparing with the approximate convex counterparts
and state-of-the-art feature selection methods. The robustness of
classification accuracy to the regularization parameter and the number of

  Convolutional Neural Networks",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As an essential processing step in computer vision applications, image
resizing or scaling, more specifically downsampling, has to be applied before
feeding a normally large image into a convolutional neural network (CNN) model
because CNN models typically take small fixed-size images as inputs. However,
image scaling functions could be adversarially abused to perform a newly
revealed attack called image-scaling attack, which can affect a wide range of
computer vision applications building upon image-scaling functions.
  This work presents an image-scaling attack detection framework, termed as
Decamouflage. Decamouflage consists of three independent detection methods: (1)
rescaling, (2) filtering/pooling, and (3) steganalysis. While each of these
three methods is efficient standalone, they can work in an ensemble manner not
only to improve the detection accuracy but also to harden potential adaptive
attacks. Decamouflage has a pre-determined detection threshold that is generic.
More precisely, as we have validated, the threshold determined from one dataset
is also applicable to other different datasets. Extensive experiments show that
Decamouflage achieves detection accuracy of 99.9\% and 99.8\% in the white-box
(with the knowledge of attack algorithms) and the black-box (without the
knowledge of attack algorithms) settings, respectively. To corroborate the
efficiency of Decamouflage, we have also measured its run-time overhead on a
personal PC with an i5 CPU and found that Decamouflage can detect image-scaling
attacks in milliseconds. Overall, Decamouflage can accurately detect image
scaling attacks in both white-box and black-box settings with acceptable
run-time overhead.

surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs). If a dark matter halo forms at the
potential hill corresponding to a void of the cosmic web, which we denote the
'elaphrocentre' in contrast to a barycentre, then the elaphrocentre should
weaken the infall rate to the halo when compared to infall rates towards
barycentres. We investigate this hypothesis numerically. We present a complete
software pipeline to simulate galaxy formation, starting from a power spectrum
of initial perturbations and an N-body simulation through to
merger-history-tree based mass infall histories. The pipeline is built from
well-established, free-licensed cosmological software packages, and aims at
highly portable long-term reproducibility. We find that the elaphrocentric
accelerations tending to oppose mass infall are modest. We do not find evidence
of location in a void or elaphrocentric position weakening mass infall towards
a galaxy. However, we find indirect evidence of voids influencing galaxy
formation: while void galaxies are of lower mass compared to galaxies in high
density environments, their spin parameters are typically higher. For a fixed
mass, the implied disk scale length would be greater. Tangential accelerations
in voids are found to be high and might significantly contribute to the higher
spin parameters. We find significantly later formation epochs for void
galaxies; this should give lower matter densities and may imply lower surface
densities of disk galaxies. Thus, void galaxies have higher spin parameters and
later formation epochs; both are factors that may increase the probability of
forming LSBGs in voids.

music signals the onset times of drums at the $\textit{tatum}$ level, where
tatum times are assumed to be estimated in advance. In conventional studies on
drum transcription, deep neural networks (DNNs) have often been used to take a
music spectrogram as input and estimate the onset times of drums at the
$\textit{frame}$ level. The major problem with such frame-to-frame DNNs,
however, is that the estimated onset times do not often conform with the
typical tatum-level patterns appearing in symbolic drum scores because the
long-term musically meaningful structures of those patterns are difficult to
learn at the frame level. To solve this problem, we propose a regularized
training method for a frame-to-tatum DNN. In the proposed method, a tatum-level
probabilistic language model (gated recurrent unit (GRU) network or
repetition-aware bi-gram model) is trained from an extensive collection of drum
scores. Given that the musical naturalness of tatum-level onset times can be
evaluated by the language model, the frame-to-tatum DNN is trained with a
regularizer based on the pretrained language model. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularized training method.

objectives at the same time: task completion and language quality. Conditioned
response generation serves as an effective approach to separately and better
optimize these two objectives. Such an approach relies on system action
annotations which are expensive to obtain. To alleviate the need of action
annotations, latent action learning is introduced to map each utterance to a
latent representation. However, this approach is prone to over-dependence on
the training data, and the generalization capability is thus restricted. To
address this issue, we propose to learn natural language actions that represent
utterances as a span of words. This explicit action representation promotes
generalization via the compositional structure of language. It also enables an
explainable generation process. Our proposed unsupervised approach learns a
memory component to summarize system utterances into a short span of words. To
further promote a compact action representation, we propose an auxiliary task
that restores state annotations as the summarized dialogue context using the
memory component. Our proposed approach outperforms latent action baselines on
MultiWOZ, a benchmark multi-domain dataset.

in near-infrared and visible (NIR-VIS) heterogeneous face recognition. However,
these methods are prone to overfitting due to the large intra-class variation
and the lack of NIR images for training. In this paper, we introduce
Domain-Based Label Face (DBLFace), a learning approach based on the assumption
that a subject is not represented by a single label but by a set of labels.
Each label represents images of a specific domain. In particular, a set of two
labels per subject, one for the NIR images and one for the VIS images, are used
for training a NIR-VIS face recognition model. The classification of images
into different domains reduces the intra-class variation and lessens the
negative impact of data imbalance in training. To train a network with sets of
labels, we introduce a domain-based angular margin loss and a maximum angular
loss to maintain the inter-class discrepancy and to enforce the close
relationship of labels in a set. Quantitative experiments confirm that DBLFace
significantly improves the rank-1 identification rate by 6.7% on the EDGE20
dataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0

of dental cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT). The proposed artifact
reduction method is designed to improve the quality of maxillofacial imaging,
where soft tissue details are not required. Compared to standard CT, the
additional difficulty of dental CBCT comes from the problems caused by offset
detector, FOV truncation, and low signal-to-noise ratio due to low X-ray
irradiation. To address these problems, the proposed method primarily performs
a sinogram adjustment in the direction of enhancing data consistency,
considering the situation according to the FOV truncation and offset detector.
This sinogram correction algorithm significantly reduces beam hardening
artifacts caused by high-density materials such as teeth, bones, and metal
implants, while tending to amplify special types of noise. To suppress such
noise, a deep convolutional neural network is complementarily used, where CT
images adjusted by the sinogram correction are used as the input of the neural
network. Numerous experiments validate that the proposed method successfully
reduces beam hardening artifacts and, in particular, has the advantage of
improving the image quality of teeth, associated with maxillofacial CBCT
imaging.

attention recently, due it is wide applications in various facial analysis
problems. However, due to the large intra-class variation of face images (such

still behind the desired accuracy level, which is necessary for the use of
these models in real-world applications. In this work, we propose a deep

high accuracy rate. Using attention mechanism enables our model to focus on the
important and informative parts of the face, which can help it to make a more
accurate prediction. We train our model in a multi-task learning fashion, and
augment the feature embedding of the age classifier, with the predicted gender,
and show that doing so can further increase the accuracy of age prediction. Our
model is trained on a popular face age and gender dataset, and achieved
promising results. Through visualization of the attention maps of the train
model, we show that our model has learned to become sensitive to the right

This unusual solidification is demonstrated in a system of passive colloidal
particles accommodating chemically active defects -- photocatalytic Janus
particles. The observed crystallization occurs when the amount of
active-defect-induced fluctuations (which is the measure of the effective
temperature) reaches critical value. The driving mechanism behind this unusual

the role of ""internal micro-blasts"" is played by the photochemical activity of
defects residing in the colloidal matrix. The defect-induced solidification
occurs under non-equilibrium conditions: the resulting solid exists as long as
a constant supply of energy in the form of ion flow is provided by the
catalytic photochemical reaction at the surface of active Janus particle
defects. Our findings could be useful for understanding of the phase
transitions of matter under extreme conditions far from thermodynamic

designed to examine the potential of an automated approach for the detection of
a range of static lying postures and corresponding transitions between
postures.Methods: Healthy subjects (n = 19) adopted a range of sagittal and
lateral lying postures. Parameters reflecting both the interactions at the
support surface and body movements were continuously monitored. Subsequently,
the derivative of each signal was examined to identify transitions between
postures. Three machine learning algorithms, namely Na{\""i}ve-Bayes, k-Nearest
Neighbors and Support Vector Machine classifiers, were assessed to predict a
range of static postures, established with a training model (n = 9) and
validated with new input from test data (n = 10).Findings: Results showed that
the derivative signals provided a means to detect transitions between postures,
with actimetry providing the most distinct signal perturbations. The accuracy
in predicting the range of postures from new test data ranged between
82%--100%, 70%--98% and 69%--100% for Na{\""i}ve-Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors and

study demonstrated that detection of both static postures and their
corresponding transitions was achieved by combining machine learning algorithms
with robust parameters from two monitoring systems. This approach has the
potential to provide reliable indicators of posture and mobility, to support
personalised pressure ulcer prevention strategies.

bear on pandemic control, powered by network theory. Like a weather satellite
providing early warning of incoming hurricanes, it empowers individuals to see
transmission approaching from far away, and incites behavior change to directly
avoid exposure. This flipped perspective engages natural self-interested
instincts of self-preservation, reducing reliance on altruism, and the
resulting caution reduces pandemic spread in the social vicinity of each
infection. Consequently, our new system solves the behavior coordination
problem which has hampered many other app-based interventions to date. We also
provide a heuristic mathematical analysis that shows how our system already
achieves critical mass from the user perspective at very low adoption
thresholds (likely below 10% in some common types of communities as indicated
empirically in the first practical deployment); after that point, the design of
our system naturally accelerates further adoption, while also alerting even
non-users of the app. This article seeks to lay the theoretical foundation for
our approach, and to open the area for further research along many dimensions.

properties for real world applications: it naturally deals with multivariate
data, it can handle heterogeneous data types, and the measures can be
interpreted in physical units. However, it has not been adopted by a wider
audience because obtaining information from multidimensional data is a
challenging problem due to the curse of dimensionality. Here we propose an
indirect way of computing information based on a multivariate Gaussianization
transform. Our proposal mitigates the difficulty of multivariate density
estimation by reducing it to a composition of tractable (marginal) operations
and simple linear transformations, which can be interpreted as a particular
deep neural network. We introduce specific Gaussianization-based methodologies
to estimate total correlation, entropy, mutual information and Kullback-Leibler
divergence. We compare them to recent estimators showing the accuracy on
synthetic data generated from different multivariate distributions. We made the
tools and datasets publicly available to provide a test-bed to analyze future
methodologies. Results show that our proposal is superior to previous
estimators particularly in high-dimensional scenarios; and that it leads to
interesting insights in neuroscience, geoscience, computer vision, and machine

modulation instability (PMI) in a nonlinear fiber Kerr resonator. This
phenomenon is phased-matched through the relative phase detuning between the
intracavity fields associated with the two principal polarization modes of the
cavity. Our experimental investigation is based on a 12-m long fiber ring
resonator in which a polarization controller is inserted to finely control the
level of intra-cavity birefringence. Depending on the amount of birefringence,
the temporal patterns generated via PMI are found to be either stationary or to
exhibit a period-doubled dynamics. Experimental results are in good agreement
with numerical simulations based on an Ikeda map for the two orthogonally
polarized modes. Our study provides new insights into the control of modulation
instability in multimode Kerr resonators. Modulation instability (MI) is a
nonlinear phenomenon characterized by the exponential growth and evolution of
periodic perturbations on top of an intense continuous-wave (cw) laser beam [1,
2]. Underpinned by a nonlinearly phase-matched parametric process, it is
associated with a transfer of energy from a narrow pump frequency component to
a pair of sidebands arranged symmetrically around the pump. In single-pass
optical fiber propagation, MI can be naturally phase-matched through a balance
between anomalous group-velocity dispersion and Kerr nonlinearity [1, 2]. In
contrast, more general phase-matching conditions are possible in the context of
passive Kerr resonators, such as fiber ring cavities, because of the crucial
role played by the systems' boundary conditions [3-5]. Various configurations
of MI have been investigated in that context, including MI in the normal
dispersion regime, MI via bichromatic or incoherent driving, as well as
competition between MI and Faraday or period-doubled (P2) instabilities
[6--12]. Moreover, at variance with single-pass propagation, MI in Kerr
resonators can lead to the emergence of stationary periodic (Turing) patterns;
such patterns are now understood to be intimately related to temporal cavity
solitons and microresonator optical frequency combs [13--16]. Birefringence,
and nonlinear coupling between the polarization components of light, is also
known to contribute to the phase-matching of parametric processes. This leads
to polarization MI (PMI) and the emergence of vector temporal patterns [17-19].
In driven resonators, PMI has only been investigated theoretically so far
[20-22], but recent demonstrations of orthogonally-polarized dual comb
generation in microresonators are sparking a renewed interest in this process
[23]. In this Letter, we report on the direct experimental observation of PMI
in a passive Kerr resonator. Our experimental test-bed is based on a normally
dispersive fiber ring cavity that incorporates a polarization controller for
adjustment of the intra-cavity birefringence. This localized birefringence
gives rise to a relative phase detuning between the two orthogonal polarization
modes of the cavity, which in turn affects the frequency shift of the PMI
sidebands. We also find that birefringence can lead to period-doubled (P2)
dynamics, characterized by a two round-trip cycle. Our experimental results are
in good agreement with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations based
on an iterative two-component Ikeda map. The experimental setup is displayed in
Fig. 1(a). It consists of a L = 12-m long passive fiber ring cavity with a
finesse F of about 27, mainly built out of spun fiber. To avoid competition
with scalar MI [2], we have built a cavity with normal group-velocity
dispersion estimated to 2 = 47 ps 2 /km, a value large enough to neglect
third-order dispersion. Also, the use of a spun fiber (nearly isotropic) avoids
group-velocity mismatch between the polarization components. Additionally, to
prevent any additional source of bending-induced birefringence, the fiber was
carefully off-spooled and wound directly on our experimental board with a large
50-cm diameter. We estimate that this causes a birefringence $\Delta$n no
greater than 10 --8 [24], which can be neglected in our study.

kind would be a piezoelectric patch mounted on a flexible plate that is

multilayered consisting of piezoelectric, substrate and electrode layers placed
on top of each other. In this paper, we first propose a quasi-monolithic
formulation with exact interface tracking to simulate the fluid-multilayered
structure interactions. We validate the proposed formulation, using an in-house
solver, by considering a simple two-layered plate-like structure with identical
material properties against a single-layered plate. We then use this
formulation to study a two-layered flexible plate, wherein each layer of the
plate has independent material properties. Systematic parametric simulations
are conducted to understand the effect of difference in material properties
between the two layers of a plate on the self-sustained flapping dynamics. The
parametric simulations are performed at a Reynolds number Re=1000 by selecting
different values of Young's modulus and density for each of the layers such
that the average structure to fluid mass ratio (m)avg=0.1 and average
non-dimensional bending stiffness (KB)avg=0.0005. Firstly, the effects of
difference in elasticity between the two layers on the flapping amplitude,
frequency, forces and vortex shedding patterns are investigated. Following
this, the effect of such difference in elastic properties on the onset of
flapping is investigated for a case with Re=1000, (m)avg=0.1 and (KB)avg=0.0008
and two distinct response regimes are observed: (a) fixed-point stable and (b)
periodic LCO. Finally, we look into the effects due to the difference in the
structural density between the two layers on the flapping dynamics of the

  Dynamics",,,,,"quant-ph physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Optimal control theory is usually formulated as an indirect method requiring
the solution of a two-point boundary value problem. Practically, the solution
is obtained by iterative forward and backward propagation of quantum
wavepackets. Here, we propose direct optimal control as a robust and flexible
alternative. It is based on a discretization of the dynamical equations
resulting in a nonlinear optimization problem. The method is illustrated for
the case of laser-driven wavepacket dynamics in a bistable potential. The
wavepacket is parameterized in terms of a single Gaussian function and field
optimization is performed for a wide range of particle masses and lengths of
the control interval. Using the optimized field in a full quantum propagation
still yields reasonable control yields for most of the considered cases.
Analysis of the deviations leads to conditions which have to be fulfilled to
make the semiclassical single Gaussian approximation meaningful for field
optimization.

the fact that the coefficients of the expansions consist of sums over connected

the intensity which allow us to pass to the thermodynamic limit. In some cases

to the data, and adaptive P-splines have been suggested. Yet, the extra
flexibility afforded by adaptive P-spline models is obtained at the cost of a
high computational burden, especially in a multidimensional setting.
Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the literature lacks proposals for

the metallicity scales are also investigated. Then we compare the observed tip
luminosities with those predicted by state-of-the-art stellar models that
include the energy-loss due to the axion production in the degenerate core of
red giant stars. We find that theoretical predictions including only the
energy-loss by plasma neutrinos are, in general, in good agreement with the
observed tip bolometric magnitudes, even though the latter are about 0.04 mag
brighter, on the average. This small shift may be the result of systematic
errors affecting the evaluation of the RGB tip bolometric magnitudes or,
alternatively, it could be ascribed to an axion-electron coupling causing a
non-negligible thermal production of axions. In order to estimate the strength
of this possible axion sink, we perform a cumulative likelihood analysis using
the RGB tips of the whole set of 22 GGCs. All the possible source of
uncertainties affecting both the measured bolometric magnitudes and the
corresponding theoretical predictions are carefully considered. As a result, we
find that the value of the axion-electron coupling parameter that maximizes the
likelihood probability is gae/10^13=0.60(+0.32;-0.58). This hint is valid,
however, if the dominant energy sinks operating in the core of red giant stars
are standard neutrinos and axions coupled with electrons. Any additional
energy-loss process, not included in the stellar models, would reduce such a
hint. Nevertheless, we find that values gae/10^13 > 1.48 can be excluded with a
95% of confidence.

infrastructure to enable isolation and access control. With an exposed
embedding, the SDN backbone can establish and survey trust zones within the IVN
and largely reduce the attack surface of connected cars. An exposed embedding

kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs), the SKIDs operating principle is based on
their sensitivity to subgap excitations. This detection scheme is advantageous
because it avoids having to lower the operating temperature proportionally to
the lowest detectable frequency. The SKIDs presented here are intrinsically
selecting the 80-90 GHz frequency band, well below the superconducting spectral
gap of the film, at approximately 180 GHz.

Learning policies for bipedal walking over various challenging terrains. In the

  Convolutional Neural Networks: Heat Conduction",,,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Numerical simulation of steady-state heat conduction is common for thermal
engineering. The simulation process usually involves mathematical formulation,
numerical discretization and iteration of discretized ordinary or partial
differential equations depending on complexity of problems. In current work, we
develop a data-driven model for extremely fast prediction of steady-state heat
conduction of a hot object with arbitrary geometry in a two-dimensional space.
Mathematically, the steady-state heat conduction can be described by the
Laplace's equation, where a heat (spatial) diffusion term dominates the
governing equation. As the intensity of the heat diffusion only depends on the
gradient of the temperature field, the temperature distribution of the
steady-state heat conduction displays strong features of locality. Therefore,
in current approach the data-driven model is developed using convolution neural
networks (CNNs), which is good at capturing local features (sub-invariant) thus
can be treated as numerical discretization in some sense. Furthermore, in our
model, a signed distance function (SDF) is proposed to represent the geometry
of the problem, which contains more information compared to a binary image. For
the training datasets, the hot objects are consisting of five simple
geometries: triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons and dodecagons. All
the geometries are different in size, shape, orientation and location. After
training, the data-driven network model is able to accurately predict
steady-state heat conduction of hot objects with complex geometries which has
never been seen by the network model; and the prediction speed is three to four
orders faster than numerical simulation. According to the outstanding
performance of the network model, it is hoped that this approach can serve as a
valuable tool for applications of engineering optimization and design in
future.

is advantageous in both diversity and amount of information, leading to a
comprehensive image understanding based on relationships, e.g., relational
proposal generation. For relational understanding between objects, the
part-of-speech (POS; i.e., subject-object-predicate categories) can be a
valuable prior information to guide the causal sequence of words in a caption.
We enforce our framework to learn not only to generate captions but also to
understand the POS of each word. To this end, we propose the multi-task
triple-stream network (MTTSNet) which consists of three recurrent units
responsible for each POS which is trained by jointly predicting the correct
captions and POS for each word. In addition, we found that the performance of
MTTSNet can be improved by modulating the object embeddings with an explicit

real deployments suffer from performance degradation as malware authors adapt
their techniques to evade detection. This phenomenon, known as concept drift,
occurs as new malware examples evolve and become less and less like the
original training examples. One promising method to cope with concept drift is
classification with rejection in which examples that are likely to be
misclassified are instead quarantined until they can be expertly analyzed.
  We propose TRANSCENDENT, a rejection framework built on Transcend, a recently
proposed strategy based on conformal prediction theory. In particular, we
provide a formal treatment of Transcend, enabling us to refine conformal
evaluation theory -- its underlying statistical engine -- and gain a better
understanding of the theoretical reasons for its effectiveness. In the process,
we develop two additional conformal evaluators that match or surpass the
performance of the original while significantly decreasing the computational
overhead. We evaluate TRANSCENDENT on a malware dataset spanning 5 years that
removes sources of experimental bias present in the original evaluation.
TRANSCENDENT outperforms state-of-the-art approaches while generalizing across
different malware domains and classifiers.
  To further assist practitioners, we determine the optimal operational
settings for a TRANSCENDENT deployment and show how it can be applied to many
popular learning algorithms. These insights support both old and new empirical
findings, making Transcend a sound and practical solution for the first time.
To this end, we release TRANSCENDENT as open source, to aid the adoption of
rejection strategies by the security community.

  bubble flow",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn physics.comp-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper present a simulation strategy for DNS of turbulent co-current
Taylor bubble flow. This is a continuation of the work presented in [2] in
which Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of co-current turbulent Taylor bubble flow
was presented. It was observed that one of the main challenges is the
physically accurate prediction of the behavior of the Taylor bubble skirt, and
the related bubble shedding. An underestimation of the turbulent fluctuations
in the wake of the Taylor bubble was observed in the LES results. It was
suggested that this is related to over-prediction of the loss of void of the
Taylor bubble due to bubble shedding induced by an LES mesh resolution which is
not sufficient to capture the break-up and bubble formation accurately. To
counter this, in the current work we present a DNS approach of co-current
turbulent Taylor bubble flow called RK-Basilisk, based on the Basilisk code
with local adaptive grid refinement. This strategy allows for very high mesh
resolution near the bubble's interface while elsewhere the grid is allowed to
be coarser. Each time step, the mesh is adapted based on a void fraction
criterion. Basilisk's underlying data structure which is based on an 'octree'
allows for much faster solution procedures and, therefore, a much greater
number of grid points as compared to the LES simulations which were performed
using the more general OpenFOAM code. We compare the results against
experimental data of the same setting, as well as the co-current LES OpenFOAM
results. The setting of turbulent Taylor bubble flow in co-current conditions
allows for both lower order turbulence model development and the validation of
more general two-phase modeling strategies. Taylor bubble flow in itself also
bears relevance to specific two-phase flow situations. The current work
contributes to an advancement in simulation capability for such situations.

critical parameters, e.g. species concentration and temperature, in reactive
flows. However, even with state-of-the-art computational algorithms the method
is limited due to the inherently ill-posed and rank-deficient tomographic data
inversion, and by high computational cost. These issues hinder its application
for real-time flow diagnosis. To address them, we present here a novel
CST-based convolutional neural Network (CSTNet) for high-fidelity, rapid, and
simultaneous imaging of species concentration and temperature. CSTNet
introduces a shared feature extractor that incorporates the CST measurement and
sensor layout into the learning network. In addition, a dual-branch
architecture is proposed for image reconstruction with crosstalk decoders that
automatically learn the naturally correlated distributions of species
concentration and temperature. The proposed CSTNet is validated both with
simulated datasets, and with measured data from real flames in experiments
using an industry-oriented sensor. Superior performance is found relative to
previous approaches, in terms of robustness to measurement noise and
millisecond-level computing time. This is the first time, to the best of our
knowledge, that a deep learning-based algorithm for CST has been experimentally
validated for simultaneous imaging of multiple critical parameters in reactive
flows using a low-complexity optical sensor with severely limited number of
laser beams.

the Euclidean plane. It is not known whether or not these problems are NP-hard.
We present approximation algorithms with better approximation ratios for both
problems. The improved ratios are obtained mainly by employing the Steiner
ratio, which has not been used in this context earlier.
  (i) Longest noncrossing spanning tree: Given a set of points in the plane,
the goal is to find a maximum-length noncrossing spanning tree. Alon,
Rajagopalan, and Suri (SoCG 1993) studied this problem for the first time and
gave a $0.5$-approximation algorithm. Over the years, the approximation ratio
has been successively improved to $0.502$, $0.503$, and to $0.512$ which is the
current best ratio, due to Cabello et al.. We revisit this problem and improve
the ratio further to $0.519$. The improvement is achieved by a collection of
ideas, some from previous works and some new ideas (including the use of the
Steiner ratio), along with a more refined analysis.
  (ii) Longest spanning tree with neighborhoods: Given a collection of regions
(neighborhoods) in the plane, the goal is to select a point in each
neighborhood so that the longest spanning tree on selected points has maximum
length. We present an algorithm with approximation ratio $0.524$ for this
problem. The previous best ratio, due to Chen and Dumitrescu, is $0.511$ which
is in turn the first improvement beyond the trivial ratio $0.5$. Our algorithm
is fairly simple, its analysis is relatively short, and it takes linear time
after computing a diametral pair of points. The simplicity comes from the fact
that our solution belongs to a set containing three stars and one double-star.
The shortness and the improvement come from the use of the Steiner ratio.

  Cells Aware Grading of Glaucomatous Progression","Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, Source Code:
  https://github.com/taimurhassan/rag-net-v2",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Objective: Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide.
Glaucomatous progression can be easily monitored by analyzing the degeneration
of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Many researchers have screened glaucoma by
measuring cup-to-disc ratios from fundus and optical coherence tomography
scans. However, this paper presents a novel strategy that pays attention to the
RGC atrophy for screening glaucomatous pathologies and grading their severity.
Methods: The proposed framework encompasses a hybrid convolutional network that
extracts the retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell with the inner plexiform
layer and ganglion cell complex regions, allowing thus a quantitative screening
of glaucomatous subjects. Furthermore, the severity of glaucoma in screened
cases is objectively graded by analyzing the thickness of these regions.
Results: The proposed framework is rigorously tested on publicly available
Armed Forces Institute of Ophthalmology (AFIO) dataset, where it achieved the
F1 score of 0.9577 for diagnosing glaucoma, a mean dice coefficient score of
0.8697 for extracting the RGC regions and an accuracy of 0.9117 for grading
glaucomatous progression. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed
framework is clinically verified with the markings of four expert
ophthalmologists, achieving a statistically significant Pearson correlation
coefficient of 0.9236. Conclusion: An automated assessment of RGC degeneration
yields better glaucomatous screening and grading as compared to the
state-of-the-art solutions. Significance: An RGC-aware system not only screens
glaucoma but can also grade its severity and here we present an end-to-end
solution that is thoroughly evaluated on a standardized dataset and is
clinically validated for analyzing glaucomatous pathologies.

wake-merging methods in engineering wind-farm wake models assume a homogeneous
background velocity field in and around the farm, relying on a single
wind-speed value usually measured several hundreds of meters upstream of the
first row of turbines. In this study, we derive a new momentum-conserving
wake-merging method capable of superimposing the waked flow on a heterogeneous
background velocity field. We couple the proposed wake-merging method with four
different wake models, i.e. the Gaussian, super-Gaussian, double-Gaussian and
Ishihara model, and we test its performance against LES data, dual-Doppler
radar measurements and SCADA data from the Horns Rev, London Array, and
Westermost Rough farm. Next to this, as an additional point of reference, the
standard Jensen model with quadratic superposition is also included. Results
show that the new method performs similarly to linear superposition of velocity
deficits in homogeneous conditions but it shows better performance when a
spatially varying background velocity is used. The most accurate estimates are
obtained when the wake-merging method is coupled with the double-Gaussian and
Gaussian single-wake model. The Ishihara model also shows good agreements with
observations. In contrast to this, the Jensen and super-Gaussian wake model
underestimate the farm power output for all wind speeds, wind directions and
wind farms considered in our analysis.

occurs via a continuous solid-hexatic transition followed by a first-order
hexatic-fluid transition. As the temperature decreases, the density range where
the hexatic phase occurs shrinks so that at low-temperature melting occurs via
a first-order liquid-solid transition. The temperature where the hexatic phase
disappears is well above the liquid-gas critical temperature. The evolution of
the density of topological defects confirms this scenario.

orbit. The X-ray flux increases in the months prior to periastron passage,
exhibiting strong flares, then rapidly declines to a flat minimum lasting a few
weeks, followed by a gradual recovery. We present Neutron Star Interior
Composition Explorer (NICER) telescope spectra obtained before, during, and
after the 2020 X-ray minimum, and perform spectral analysis to establish the
temporal behavior of X-ray flux and X-ray-absorbing column density ($N_{\rm

dominated by the stellar wind collision region and, therefore, these spectral
parameters - in particular, $N_{\rm H}(t)$ - serves as a potentially stringent
constraint on the binary orientation. We compare the observed $N_{\rm H}(t)$
results to the behavior predicted by a simple geometrical model in an attempt
to ascertain which star is closer to us at periastron: the more massive primary
($\omega \simeq 240$-$270^\circ$), or the secondary ($\omega \simeq 90^\circ$).
We find that the variations in column density, both far from periastron and
around periastron passage, support the latter configuration ($\omega \simeq

exhibits a transient development of the low-$T/|W|$ instability with one-armed
spiral flow at the early postbounce phase. Subsequently, the two-armed spiral
flow appears, which persists during the simulation time. The moderately
rotating model also shows the growth of the low-$T/|W|$ instability, but only
with the two-armed spiral flow. In the nonrotating model, a vigorous activity
of the standing accretion-shock instability (SASI) is only observed. The SASI
is first dominated by the sloshing mode, which is followed by the spiral SASI
until the black hole formation. We present a spectrogram analysis of the
gravitational waves (GWs) and neutrinos, focusing on the time correlation. Our
results show that characteristic time modulations in the GW and neutrino
signals can be linked to the growth of the non-axisymmetric instabilities. We
find that the degree of the protoneutron star (PNS) deformation, depending upon
which modes of the non-axisymmetric instabilities develop, predominantly
affects the characteristic frequencies of the correlated GW and neutrino
signals. We point out that these signals would be simultaneously detectable by
the current-generation detectors up to $\sim10$ kpc. Our findings suggest that

most important and urgent strategies throughout the whole world. As of October,
2020, there have not yet been any medicines or therapies to be effective
against SARS-CoV-2. Thus, rapid and sensitive diagnostics is the most important
measures to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2. Homogeneous biosensing based on
magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is one of the most promising approaches for rapid
and highly sensitive detection of biomolecules. This paper proposes an approach
for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 with functionalized MNPs via
the measurement of their magnetic response in an ac magnetic field.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach allows the rapid
detection of mimic SARS-CoV-2 with a limit of detection of 0.084 nM (5.9
fmole). The proposed approach has great potential for designing a low-cost and
point-of-care device for rapid and sensitive diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2.

applied in large-scale industrial software developments but due to its granular
responsibilities with roles assigned to various members of the development
team, these practices may not be applicable to scientific code development,
especially in an academic environment, where it is not uncommon that the
codebase is developed, maintained and used by a single person. Even for
collaborative scientific software development, financed through external

in contrast to how software is developed in many industries, where the
development team and end-users are two separate entities. There are, however,
many good code development practices that can be adopted for scientific
software projects. Specifically, the intention of this article is to take the
centrepiece of agile software development and tailor it to scientific and
academic, single-user code development. In this study, a c++ starter project is
developed and made available, based on the meson build system, which provides
native support for software testing. It is used to show how a simple linear
algebra application, found in many scientific and academic applications, can be
developed and how simple unit, integration and system tests can be created that
are managed through the meson build system. In this way, we are able to
minimise software defects and reduce the risk to interpret incorrect data
generated by erroneous software that may result in the wrong conclusions to be
drawn. Each layer of testing presents one additional layer of protection and we
will explore how these may be incorporated with minimum overhead to produce

reaction-diffusion systems (RDs) and is known to bring about coarsening of the
pattern in chemical concentration. Recent theoretical studies on RDs with mass
conservation (MCRDs) reported that the interfacial curvature between two states
contributes to the coarsening process, reminiscent of phase separation
phenomena. However, since MCRDs do not presuppose a variational principle, it
is largely unknown whether description of surface tension is operative or not.
In this study, we numerically and theoretically explore the coarsening process
of patterns in MCRDs in two and three dimensions. We identify the parameter
regions where the homogeneous steady state becomes stable, unstable, and
metastable. In the unstable region, pattern formation is triggered by usual
Turing instability, whereas in the metastable region, nucleation-growth-type
pattern formation is observed. In the later stage, spherical droplet patterns
are observed in both regions, where they obey a relation similar to the
Young-Laplace law and coarsen following the evaporation-condensation mechanism.
These results demonstrate that in the presence of a conserved variable, a
physical quantity similar to surface tension is relevant to MCRDs, which
provides new insight into molecular self-assembly driven by chemical reactions.

for construction of bi-periodic extensions of smooth non-periodic functions
defined over general two-dimensional smooth domains. The approach can be
directly generalized to domains of any given dimensionality, and even to
non-smooth domains, but such generalizations are not considered here. The 2D-FC
extensions are produced in a two-step procedure. In the first step the
one-dimensional Fourier Continuation method is applied along a discrete set of
outward boundary-normal directions to produce, along such directions,
continuations that vanish outside a narrow interval beyond the boundary. Thus,
the first step of the algorithm produces ""blending-to-zero along normals"" for
the given function values. In the second step, the extended function values are
evaluated on an underlying Cartesian grid by means of an efficient, high-order
boundary-normal interpolation scheme. A Fourier Continuation expansion of the
given function can then be obtained by a direct application of the
two-dimensional FFT algorithm. Algorithms of arbitrarily high order of accuracy
can be obtained by this method. The usefulness and performance of the proposed
two-dimensional Fourier Continuation method are illustrated with applications
to the Poisson equation and the time-domain wave equation within a bounded
domain. As part of these examples the novel ""Fourier Forwarding"" solver is
introduced which, propagating plane waves as they would in free space and
relying on certain boundary corrections, can solve the time-domain wave
equation and other hyperbolic partial differential equations within general
domains at computing costs that grow sublinearly with the size of the spatial

catalysis in open-cell foam structures, which is based on isotropic Stochastic
Rotation Dynamics (iSRD) together with Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG). The
approach is validated by means of experimental results for the low temperature
water-gas shift reaction in an open-cell foam structure modeled as inverse
sphere packing. Considering the relation between Sherwood and Reynolds number,
we find two distinct regimes meeting approximately at the strut size Reynolds
number 10. For typical parameters from the literature, we find that the
catalyst density in the washcoat can be reduced considerably without a notable
loss of conversion efficiency. We vary the porosity to determine optimum
open-cell foam structures, which combine low flow resistance with high
conversion efficiency and find large porosity values to be favorable not only
in the mass transfer limited regime but also in the intermediate regime.

Sco stands out in this list because the system is composed of two equal mass F5

radii at periastron passage. This configuration is optimal for accretion
studies because enhance accretion events can be precisely timed at periastron
passage. In this work, we present the results from the monitoring of the AK Sco
system with Hubble during three consecutive periastron passages. These data
provide a unique dataset to spectroscopically characterize accretion and
evaluate the inter-cycle variability of the system. Clear evidence of accretion
rate enhancement was observed in cycle1 and 3: the blueing of the near UV
continuum, the sudden flux increase of important accretion tracers, such as the
N V, Si IV and C IV lines, and also of neutral/singly ionized species such as O
I and C II. Also, variations in the Si III]/C III] ratio reveals an enhancement
of the electron density by an order of magnitude during the periastron passage.
Moreover, in cycle 3, the spectral resolution of the observations obtained with
the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph enabled discerning that the flow was channelled
preferentially into one of the two components. The most remarkable feature in
the cycle-to-cycle variations was the detection of a notable increase of the UV
flux from cycle 1 to 2 that was not accompanied by enhanced accretion
signatures.

algorithmic process of creating theorems. To this process we introduce a
generalisation step, which itself requires the ability to infer and then verify
parameterised families of theorems. This thesis introduces such inference and
verification frameworks, in doing so forging novel links between graphical
calculi and fields such as Algebraic Geometry and Galois Theory. These
frameworks inspired further research into the design of graphical calculi, and
we introduce two important new calculi here. First is the calculus RING, which
is initial among ring-based qubit graphical calculi, and in turn inspired the
introduction and classification of phase homomorphism pairs also presented
here. The second is the calculus ZQ, an edge-decorated calculus which naturally
expresses arbitrary qubit rotations, eliminating the need for non-linear rules
such as (EU) of ZX. It is expected that these results will be of use to those
creating optimisation schemes and intermediate representations for quantum
computing, to those creating new graphical calculi, and for those performing

shelter or evacuated without delays. Risk management and evacuation planning in
public spaces should also take into account uncertainties in the traffic
patterns of crowd flow. One way to account for the uncertainties is to make use
of safety staff, or guides, that lead the crowd out of the building according
to an evacuation plan. Nevertheless, solving the minimum time evacuation plan
is a computationally demanding problem. In this paper, we model the evacuating
crowd and guides as a multi-agent system with the social force model. To
represent uncertainty, we construct probabilistic scenarios. The evacuation
plan should work well both on average and also for the worst-performing
scenarios. Thus, we formulate the problem as a bi-objective scenario
optimization problem, where the mean and conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) of
the evacuation time are objectives. A solution procedure combining numerical
simulation and genetic algorithm is presented. We apply it to the evacuation of
a fictional passenger terminal. In the mean-optimal solution, guides are
assigned to lead the crowd to the nearest exits, whereas in the CVaR-optimal
solution the focus is on solving the physical congestion occurring in the
worst-case scenario. With one guide positioned behind each agent group near
each exit, a plan that minimizes both objectives is obtained.

(SA) and uncertainty quantification (UQ). It enables users to verify key
aspects of their applications, systematically compare and validate the
simulation outputs against observational or benchmark data, and run simulations
conveniently on any platform from the desktop to current multi-petascale

seven different domains such as conflict modelling and environmental sciences.
We also present several implemented patterns for UQ/SA and V&V, and guide the

(`recycled') during an earlier accretion phase. They typically have relatively
weak ($\lesssim 10^{9} \text{ G}$) dipole field strengths, consistent with
accretion-induced magnetic burial. Recent data from the Neutron Star Interior
Composition Explorer indicate that hot spots atop the recycled pulsar PSR
J0030$+$0451 are not antipodal, so that the magnetic field cannot be that of a
centered dipole. In this paper it is shown that multipolarity is naturally
expected in the burial scenario because of equatorial field line compression.
Grad-Shafranov equilibria are constructed to show how magnetic multipole
moments can be calculated in terms of various properties, such as the amount of
accreted mass and the crustal equation of state.

ranging from an active gas to a dynamic labyrinthine phase as well as dense
tetragonal and hexagonal crystals. Intermediate volume fractions are
characterised by two--dimensional sheets with large fluctuations reminiscent of
active membranes. These active sheets break symmetry in a direction
perpendicular to the applied field. Moreover, the relationship between electric

cases, when the perturbation is small relative to the coupling to the

to a sum of a system correlation functions and additional forces induced by the
surroundings. Away from these limiting regimes however, the secular
approximation results in a singular response that cannot be captured within the
traditional approach, but can be described by reverting to a microscopic
Hamiltonian description. These findings are illustrated by explicit
calculations in coupled qubits and anharmonic oscillators in contact with

pressure-velocity coupling for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations on unstructured collocated grids is presented in this paper. This new
method for implicit time stepping is an extension of the conservative
symmetry-preserving incremental-pressure projection method for explicit time
stepping and unstructured collocated meshes of Trias et al. (2014). In order to
assess and compare both methods, we have implemented them within one unified
solver in the open source code OpenFOAM. We combine both methods with a Butcher
tableau for a family of explicit and diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta temporal
schemes. We assess the energy conservation properties of the implemented
discretisation methods and the temporal consistency of the selected Runge-Kutta
schemes using Taylor-Green vortex and lid-driven cavity flow test cases.
  Although both implemented methods are based on a symmetry-preserving
discretisation, we show that both methods still produce a small amount of
numerical dissipation when the total pressure is directly solved from a Poisson
equation. This numerical dissipation is mainly caused by the corresponding
pressure error which is of $O(\Delta t \Delta h^2)$. When an
incremental-pressure approach is used, where a pressure correction is solved
from a Poisson equation, the pressure error reduces to $O(\Delta t^2 \Delta
h^2)$, yielding better conservation properties: both methods are then
effectively fully-conservative. Furthermore, we conclude that all selected
explicit and implicit higher order temporal schemes suffer from a reduction of
the temporal order to approximately one when the pressure Poisson equation is
based on the total pressure due to the presence of a pressure error of
$O(\Delta t \Delta h^2)$.

coherent, such enhancement is prone to decoherence effects due to the coupling
of the system to an external environment. We study this interplay between
incoherent and coherent quantum corrections to decay by evaluating, within a
Caldeira-Legget scenario, off-diagonal contributions to the decoherence
functional coming from pairs of correlated classical paths in the time regime
where dissipative effects are neglected and decoherence does not affect the

impacted by anharmonic quantum fluctuations in the molecular layer and at
bonding sites, these anharmonic contributions play a minor role when analysing
isotope effects at low temperatures. Nevertheless, anharmonic quantum
fluctuations cause an increase in the distance between the molecular layer and

Traditionally, this term has been taken to express heterogeneity of the node
degrees of a therefore complex network. However, given that the degree
distribution is not enough to provide an invertible representation of a given
network, additional complementary measurements of its topology are required in
order to complement its characterization. In the present work, we aim at
obtaining a new model of complex networks, called hypercomplex networks - HC,
that are characterized by heterogeneity not only of the degree distribution,
but also of a relatively complete set of complementary topological measurements
including node degree, shortest path length, clustering coefficient,
betweenness centrality, matching index, Laplacian eigenvalue and hierarchical
node degree. The proposed model starts with uniformly random networks, namely
Erdos-Renyi structures, and then applies optimization so as to increase an
index of the overall complexity of the networks. An optimization approach has
been considered in terms of gradient descent. The complexity index expresses
the dispersion of the several considered measurements. Several interesting
results are reported and discussed, including the fact that the HC networks
define, as the optimization proceeds, a trajectory in the principal component
space of the measurements that tends to depart from the considered theoretical
models (Erdos-Renyi, Barabasi-Albert, Waxman, Random Geometric Graph and
Watts-Strogatz), heading to a previously empty space (low density of cases). We
observed that, after a considerably large number of optimization steps,

utterance-level contextualized representations and fine-grained topic-level
graph representations to evaluate dialogue coherence. The graph representations
are obtained by reasoning over topic-level dialogue graphs enhanced with the
evidence from a commonsense graph, including k-hop neighboring representations

to create low energy flat bands and the resulting correlated insulating,
superconducting, and magnetic phases in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). While
most of previous works focus on revealing these emergent states in MA-TBG, a
study of the twist angle dependence, which helps to map an evolution of these
phases, is yet less explored. Here, we report a magneto-transport study on one
non-magic angle TBG device, whose twist angle {\theta} changes from 1.25{\deg}
at one end to 1.43{\deg} at the other. For {\theta}=1.25{\deg}, we observe an
emergence of topological insulating states at hole side with a sequence of
Chern number |C|=4-|v|, where v is the number of electrons (holes) in moir\'e
unite cell. When {\theta}>1.25{\deg}, the Chern insulator from flat band
disappears and evolves into fractal Hofstadter butterfly quantum Hall insulator
where magnetic flux in one moir\'e unite cell matters. Our observations will
stimulate further theoretical and experimental investigations on the
relationship between electron interactions and non-trivial band topology.

quantum computing. In general applications, current QPE algorithms either
suffer an exponential time overload or require a set of - notoriously quite
fragile - GHZ states. These limitations have prevented so far the demonstration
of QPE beyond proof-of-principles. Here we propose a new QPE algorithm that
scales linearly with time and is implemented with a cascade of Gaussian spin
states (GSS). GSS are renownedly resilient and have been created experimentally
in a variety of platforms, from hundreds of ions up to millions of
cold/ultracold neutral atoms. We show that our protocol achieves a QPE
sensitivity overcoming previous bounds, including those obtained with GHZ
states, and is robustly resistant to several sources of noise and decoherence.
Our work paves the way toward realistic quantum advantage demonstrations of the
QPE, as well as applications of atomic squeezed states for quantum computation.

By looking at diagrams of the Gibbs free energy and the heat capacity at

hence, to obtain more reliable tractograms. Our method, dubbed FINTA (Filtering
in Tractography using Autoencoders) uses raw, unlabeled tractograms to train

Such an embedding is then used to filter undesired streamline samples using a
nearest neighbor algorithm. Our experiments on both synthetic and in vivo human

can be applied to partial tractograms without requiring changes to the

different tracking methods and datasets, and shortens significantly the

brings forward a new deep learning framework in tractography based on

general real images. For instance, EdgeCRF based on colour patches extracted
from edges works effectively only when the presence of noise is insignificant,
which is not the case for many real images; and, CRFNet, a recent method based
on fully supervised deep learning works only for the CRFs that are in the
training data, and hence fail to deal with other possible CRFs beyond the
training data. To address these problems, we introduce a non-deep-learning
method using prediction consistency and gradual refinement. First, we rely more
on the patches of the input image that provide more consistent predictions. If
the predictions from a patch are more consistent, it means that the patch is
likely to be less affected by noise or any inferior colour combinations, and
hence, it can be more reliable for CRF estimation. Second, we employ a gradual
refinement scheme in which we start from a simple CRF model to generate a
result which is more robust to noise but less accurate, and then we gradually
increase the model's complexity to improve the result. This is because a simple
model, while being less accurate, overfits less to noise than a complex model
does. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the existing
single-image methods for daytime and nighttime real images. We further propose
a more efficient deep learning extension that performs test-time training
(based on unsupervised losses) on the test input image. This provides our
method better generalization performance than CRFNet making it more practically
applicable for CRF estimation for general real images.

thin, yet non-flat objects in a single shot (without relying on more

difficult.
  Here, we present a method that improves the resolution of light microscopy
images of such objects by locally estimating image distortion while jointly
estimating object distance to the focal plane. Specifically, we estimate the
parameters of a spatially-variant Point-Spread function (PSF) model using a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which does not require instrument- or
object-specific calibration. Our method recovers PSF parameters from the image
itself with up to a squared Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.99 in ideal

or photon noise. When the recovered PSFs are used with a spatially-variant and
regularized Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm, we observed up to 2.1 dB
better signal-to-noise ratio compared to other blind deconvolution techniques.
Following microscope-specific calibration, we further demonstrate that the
recovered PSF model parameters permit estimating surface depth with a precision
of 2 micrometers and over an extended range when using engineered PSFs. Our

dynamical systems from a single sample trajectory. A major practical challenge
in the existing system identification methods is the undesirable dependency of
their required sample size on the system dimension: roughly speaking, they
presume and rely on sample sizes that scale linearly with respect to the system
dimension. Evidently, in high-dimensional regime where the system dimension is
large, it may be costly, if not impossible, to collect as many samples from the
unknown system. In this paper, we will remedy this undesirable dependency on
the system dimension by introducing an $\ell_1$-regularized estimation method
that can accurately estimate the Markov parameters of the system, provided that
the number of samples scale logarithmically with the system dimension. Our
result significantly improves the sample complexity of learning partially
observed linear dynamical systems: it shows that the Markov parameters of the
system can be learned in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of
samples is significantly smaller than the system dimension. Traditionally, the
$\ell_1$-regularized estimators have been used to promote sparsity in the
estimated parameters. By resorting to the notion of ""weak sparsity"", we show
that, irrespective of the true sparsity of the system, a similar regularized
estimator can be used to reduce the sample complexity of learning partially
observed linear systems, provided that the true system is inherently stable.

they suffer from inaccuracies due to the cost and complexity of setting their
fine-grained parameters, such as the latencies of individual instructions. This
complexity arises from the expertise required to design benchmarks and
measurement frameworks that can precisely measure the values of parameters at
such fine granularity. In some cases, these parameters do not necessarily have
a physical realization and are therefore fundamentally approximate, or even
unmeasurable.
  In this paper we present DiffTune, a system for learning the parameters of
x86 basic block CPU simulators from coarse-grained end-to-end measurements.
Given a simulator, DiffTune learns its parameters by first replacing the
original simulator with a differentiable surrogate, another function that
approximates the original function; by making the surrogate differentiable,
DiffTune is then able to apply gradient-based optimization techniques even when
the original function is non-differentiable, such as is the case with CPU
simulators. With this differentiable surrogate, DiffTune then applies
gradient-based optimization to produce values of the simulator's parameters
that minimize the simulator's error on a dataset of ground truth end-to-end
performance measurements. Finally, the learned parameters are plugged back into
the original simulator.
  DiffTune is able to automatically learn the entire set of
microarchitecture-specific parameters within the Intel x86 simulation model of
llvm-mca, a basic block CPU simulator based on LLVM's instruction scheduling
model. DiffTune's learned parameters lead llvm-mca to an average error that not
only matches but lowers that of its original, expert-provided parameter values.

mid-plane. Our best-fitting model gives an Oort limit of $0.08^{0.05}_{-0.02}
M_{\odot}/\rm pc^{3}$, which is close to estimates from recent Jeans analyses.
Given the accounting of the baryon budget from McKee et al. (2015), we obtain a
local dark matter density of $-0.004^{0.05}_{-0.02}~M_{\odot}/\rm pc^{3}$,
which is slightly below other modern estimates but consistent within the
current uncertainties of our method. While this first measurement of the Oort
limit (and other Galactic parameters) has error bars that are currently several
times larger than kinematical estimates, they should improve in the future. We
also constrain the oblateness of the potential, finding it consistent with that
expected from the disk and inconsistent with a potential dominated by a
spherical halo, as is appropriate for our sample which is within a $\sim$ kpc
of the Sun. We find that the slope of the rotation curve is not constrained by
current measurements of binary pulsar accelerations. We give a fitting function
for the vertical acceleration $a_{z}$: $a_{z} = -\alpha_{1}z$; $\log_{10}

salient features in their respective domains. Finally, two-phase saliency
integration scheme is devised to combine these maps using pixelwise

generate better segmentation result as compared to state-of-the-art methods.

We conducted a detailed chemical analysis of five M dwarfs (T_eff ~3200--3800

analysis based on high-resolution (R ~80,000) near-infrared (960--1710 nm)

elements (Na, Mg, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, and Fe), which are in agreement with those
of the primary stars within measurement errors (~0.2 dex). Through the analysis
process, we investigated the unique behavior of atomic lines in a cool
atmosphere. Most atomic lines are sensitive to changes in abundance not only of
the corresponding elements but also of other elements, especially dominant
electron donors such as Na and Ca. The Ti I lines show a negative correlation
with the overall metallicity at T_eff < 3400 K due to the consumption of
neutral titanium by the formation of TiO molecules. These findings indicate
that to correctly estimate the overall metallicity or the abundance of any

Logic rules provide interpretable explanations when used for prediction as well

sparse rewards (e.g., techniques based on reinforcement learning). To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a probabilistic model called RNNLogic.
RNNLogic treats logic rules as a latent variable, and simultaneously trains a

EM-based algorithm for optimization. In each iteration, the reasoning predictor
is first updated to explore some generated logic rules for reasoning. Then in
the E-step, we select a set of high-quality rules from all generated rules with
both the rule generator and reasoning predictor via posterior inference; and in
the M-step, the rule generator is updated with the rules selected in the
E-step. Experiments on four datasets prove the effectiveness of RNNLogic.

functional theory (DFT) calculations conducted on thousands of crystalline
compounds, has led to accelerated material discovery and property predictions.
However, so far amorphous materials have been largely excluded from this as
these systems are notoriously difficult to simulate. Here we study amorphous
Ta$_2$O$_5$ thin films mixed with Al$_2$O$_3$, SiO$_2$, Sc$_2$O$_3$, TiO$_2$,
ZnO, ZrO$_2$, Nb$_2$O$_5$ and HfO$_2$ to identify their crystalline structure
upon post-deposition annealing in air both experimentally and with simulations.
Using the Materials Project open database, phase diagrams based on DFT
calculations are constructed for the mixed oxide systems and the annealing
process is evaluated via grand potential diagrams with varying oxygen chemical
potential. Despite employing calculations based on crystalline bulk materials,
the predictions agree well with the experimentally observed crystallized phases
of the amorphous films. Only in two cases the database leads to incorrect
predictions: in TiO$_2$-doped Ta$_2$O$_5$ because it does not contain a ternary
compound found experimentally, and in Sc$_2$O$_3$-doped Ta$_2$O$_5$ because DFT
overestimates the formation enthalpy difference between Sc$_2$O$_3$ and
Ta$_2$O$_5$ and thus does not reproduce observed oxygen competition effects. In
the absence of ternary phases, the dopant acts as an amorphizer agent

extraction for low-power applications, such as distributed sensor networks.
Fluid-structure instabilities dictate a harvester's viability since the
structural response to the flow determines its power output. Previous work on a
flextensional-based flow energy harvester demonstrated that an elastic member
within a converging-diverging channel is susceptible to the aeroelastic
flutter. This work explores the mechanism driving flutter through experiments
and simulations. A model is then developed based on channel flow-rate
modulation and considering the effects of both normal and spanwise flow
confinement on the instability. Linear stability analysis of the model
replicates flutter onset, critical frequency, and mode shapes observed in
experiments. The model suggests that flow modulation through the channel throat
is the principal mechanism for the fluid-induced vibration. The generalized
model presented can serve as the foundation of design parameter exploration for
energy harvesters, perhaps leading to more powerful devices in the future, but
also to other similar flow geometries where the flutter instability arises in
an elastic member within a narrow flow passage.

a function of a dimensionless radial coordinate. It was considered that the
ratio of the sound velocity far the massive body and the speed of light was of
order $a_\infty/c=10^{-2}$. The analysis of the solution led to following
results: the Mach number for the Newtonian and post-Newtonian accretion have
practically the same values for radial distances of order of the critical
radial distance; by decreasing the radial distance the Mach number for the
Newtonian accretion is bigger than the one for the post-Newtonian accretion;
the Mach number increases by decreasing the ratio of the specific heats; the
difference between the Newtonian and post-Newtonian Mach numbers when the ratio
$a_\infty/c\ll10^{-2}$ is insignificant. The effect of the correction terms in
post-Newtonian Bernoulli equation is more perceptive for the lowest values of
the radial distance, and the solutions for $a_\infty/c>10^{-2}$ does not lead
to a continuous inflow and outflow velocity at the critical point. A comparison
of the solutions with those that follow from a relativistic Bernoulli equation
shows that the dependence of the Mach number with the radial distance of the
former is bigger than the post-Newtonian ones.

formative phase of galaxies, although their physical origin remains uncertain.
GCs are most numerous around massive elliptical galaxies, where they can
exhibit a broad colour dispersion, suggesting a wide metallicity spread. Here,
we show that many thousands of compact and massive (~5$\times$10$^{\rm
3}-$3$\times$ 10$^{\rm 6} M_{\odot}$) star clusters have formed at an
approximately steady rate over, at least, the past ~1Gyr around NGC 1275, the
central giant elliptical galaxy of the Perseus cluster. Beyond ~1Gyr, these
star clusters are indistinguishable in broadband optical colours from the more
numerous GCs. Their number distribution exhibits a similar dependence with
luminosity and mass as the GCs, whereas their spatial distribution resembles a
filamentary network of multiphase gas associated with cooling of the
intracluster gas. The sustained formation of these star clusters demonstrates
that progenitor GCs can form over cosmic history from cooled intracluster gas,
thus contributing to both the large number and broad colour dispersion$-$owing
to an age spread, in addition to a spread in metallicity$-$of GCs in massive
elliptical galaxies. The progenitor GCs have minimal masses well below the
maximal masses of Galactic open star clusters, affirming a common formation
mechanism for star clusters over all mass scales irrespective of their
formative pathways.

A global sensitivity analysis that is capable of exploring the entire input

We address this research gap by integrating Gaussian process emulation into
landslide run-out modeling and apply it to the open-source simulation tool
r.avaflow. The feasibility and efficiency of our approach is illustrated based
on the 2017 Bondo landslide event. The sensitivity of aggregated model outputs,
such as the apparent friction angle, impact area, as well as spatially resolved
maximum flow height and velocity, to the dry-Coulomb friction coefficient,
turbulent friction coefficient and the release volume are studied. The results
of first-order effects are consistent with previous results of common
one-at-a-time sensitivity analyses. In addition to that, our approach allows to
rigorously investigate interactions. Strong interactions are detected on the
margins of the flow path where the expectation and variation of maximum flow
height and velocity are small. The interactions generally become weak with
increasing variation of maximum flow height and velocity. Besides, there are
stronger interactions between the two friction coefficients than between the
release volume and each friction coefficient. In the future, it is promising to
extend the approach for other computationally expensive tasks like uncertainty
quantification, model calibration, and smart early warning.

the criterion of minimum learning latency. Two cases are considered. First, for
the case of decomposable models (e.g., logistic regression), the
latency-minimization problem is a mixed-integer program and non-convex. Due to
its intractability, we develop a practical solution by integer relaxation and
transforming it into an equivalent convex problem of model size maximization

we show that the ground state of a Bose system of any density should correspond

anisotropic state of a system of spinless bosons is degenerate. We prove this
for an infinite three-dimensional (3D) system and a finite ball-shaped 3D

Therefore, the anisotropic state cannot be the genuine ground state. Hence, a
zero-temperature natural 3D crystal should correspond to an excited state of a
Bose system. The wave function $\Psi^{c}_{0}$ of a zero-temperature 3D Bose
crystal is proposed for zero boundary conditions. Apparently, such

asymmetric QNNs would require many precision formats and an exorbitant amount

an embedding of local 3D geometry to match the CAD models to the input images.
For points at the surface of objects, this embedding can be computed directly
from the CAD model; for image locations, we learn to predict it from the image
itself. This establishes correspondences between 3D points on the CAD model and
2D locations of the input images. However, many of these correspondences are
ambiguous as many points may have similar local geometries. We show that we can
use Mask-RCNN in a class-agnostic way to detect the new objects without
retraining and thus drastically limit the number of possible correspondences.
We can then robustly estimate a 3D pose from these discriminative
correspondences using a RANSAC- like algorithm. We demonstrate the performance
of this approach on the T-LESS dataset, by using a small number of objects to
learn the embedding and testing it on the other objects. Our experiments show

sphincter allows the transition of ingested materials from pharyngeal into
esophageal stages of swallowing and a reduced duration of opening can lead to
penetration/aspiration and/or pharyngeal residue. Therefore, in this study we
consider a non-invasive high resolution cervical auscultation-based screening

Moreover, the predicted opening and closure moments surprisingly fell within an

low generalizability, caused by a typically selective choice of problem

Among other issues, this practice promotes overfitting and poor-performing user
guidelines. To address this shortcoming, we propose in this work a benchmark
suite, OptimSuite, which covers a broad range of black-box optimization
problems, ranging from academic benchmarks to real-world applications, from
discrete over numerical to mixed-integer problems, from small to very
large-scale problems, from noisy over dynamic to static problems, etc. We
demonstrate the advantages of such a broad collection by deriving from it
Automated Black Box Optimizer (ABBO), a general-purpose algorithm selection
wizard. Using three different types of algorithm selection techniques, ABBO
achieves competitive performance on all benchmark suites. It significantly
outperforms previous state of the art on some of them, including YABBOB and
LSGO. ABBO relies on many high-quality base components. Its excellent
performance is obtained without any task-specific parametrization.
  The OptimSuite benchmark collection, the ABBO wizard and its base solvers
have all been merged into the open-source Nevergrad platform, where they are
available for reproducible research.

trapped EP component is introduced through a modification of the drift
frequency to include their precessional drift. The stabilization trends of the
1/1 EIC observed experimentally with respect to the thermal plasma density and
temperature are reproduced by the simulations, showing a reasonable agreement
with the data. The LHD operation scenarios with stable 1/1 EIC are identified,
leading to the stabilization of the 1/1 EIC if the thermal plasma density and
temperature are above a given threshold. The 1/1 EIC are also stabilized if the
rotational transform is modified in a way that the 1/1 rational surface is
located further away than 0.9 times the normalized radius, or the magnetic
shear in the plasma periphery is enhanced. Also, LHD discharges with large
magnetic fields show a higher EIC destabilization threshold with respect to the
thermal plasma density. If the perpendicular NBI deposition region is moved
further inward than 0.875 times the normalized radius the 1/1 EIC are also
stabilized. In addition, increasing the perpendicular NBI voltage such that the
EP energy is higher than 30 keV stabilizes the 1/1 EIC. Moreover, Deuterium
plasmas show a higher stability threshold for the 1/1 EIC than Hydrogen
plasmas. The experimental data shows a larger time interval between EIC events
as the power of the tangential NBI is increased providing that the
perpendicular NBI power is at least 13 MW. This implies a stabilizing effect of
the tangential NBI.

use of a binary domain classifier and integrate it with the task network and
train them jointly end-to-end. The binary domain classifier yields a density
ratio that reflects the closeness of a target (test) sample to the source

generates calibrated uncertainties that benefit many downstream tasks, such as
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and semi-supervised learning (SSL). In
these tasks, methods like self-training and FixMatch use uncertainties to
select confident pseudo-labels for re-training. Our experiments show that the
introduction of DRL leads to significant improvements in cross-domain

electroencephalography (EEG) signals in a steady-state visually evoked
potentials (SSVEP) based single-channel brain-computer interface (BCI), which
does not require calibration on the user.
  Methods: EEG signals were converted to spectrograms and served as input to
train DCNNs using the transfer learning technique. We also modified and applied
a data augmentation method, SpecAugment, generally employed for speech
recognition. Furthermore, for comparison purposes, we classified the SSVEP
dataset using Support-vector machines (SVMs) and Filter Bank canonical
correlation analysis (FBCCA).
  Results: Excluding the evaluated user's data from the fine-tuning process, we
reached 82.2% mean test accuracy and 0.825 mean F1-Score on 35 subjects from an
open dataset, using a small data length (0.5 s), only one electrode (Oz) and
the DCNN with transfer learning, window slicing (WS) and SpecAugment's time
masks.
  Conclusion: The DCNN results surpassed SVM and FBCCA performances, using a
single electrode and a small data length. Transfer learning provided minimal
accuracy change, but made training faster. SpecAugment created a small
performance improvement and was successfully combined with WS, yielding higher
accuracies.
  Significance: We present a new methodology to solve the problem of SSVEP
classification using DCNNs. We also modified a speech recognition data
augmentation technique and applied it to the context of BCIs. The presented
methodology surpassed performances obtained with FBCCA and SVMs (more
traditional SSVEP classification methods) in BCIs with small data lengths and
one electrode. This type of BCI can be used to develop small and fast systems.

explain this predominance of the jaw in early babbling. This hypothesis states
that general stochastic optimization principles, when applied to learning
sensorimotor control, automatically generate ordered babbling stages with a
predominant exploration of jaw movements in early stages. The reason is that
those movements impact the auditory effects more than other articulators. In
previous computational models, such general principles were shown to
selectively freeze and free degrees of freedom in a model reproducing the
proximo-distal development observed in infant arm reaching. The contribution of
this paper is to show how, using the same methods, we are able to explain such
patterns in vocal development. We present three experiments. The two first ones
show that the recruitment order of articulators emerging from stochastic
optimization depends on the target sound to be achieved but that on average the
jaw is largely chosen as the first recruited articulator. The third experiment
analyses in more detail how the emerging recruitment order is shaped by the
dynamics of the optimization process.

Nonetheless, centralization has been mostly characterized by exclusively
looking at the influence that independent miners or mining pools can have over
the network. Moreover, models of mining behavior assume that miners are either
unrelated or only relate via mining pools under highly structured and
transparent agreements. If these assumptions and the predictions they entail
were to be completely accurate, there would not be any evidence of on-chain
transactions between miners, other than the ones expected from mining pool
payouts. By looking at on-chain transactions between miners in the Ethereum
Network we find that aside from the payouts from mining pools to small miners,
there are also transactions that define relationships between mining pools,
independent miners and between independent miners and mining pools.
Furthermore, by characterizing the topology of the network of miner
transactions, we find the emergence of highly connected clusters that control
significant amounts of hashing power and exhibit relationships in the opposite
direction of what theoretical models predict. This more nuanced
characterization of mining centralization can help identify network
vulnerabilities and inform protocol redesigns.

clouds as sets of samples drawn from a cloud-specific probability distribution.
This interpretation matches intrinsic characteristics of point clouds: the
number of points and their ordering within a cloud is not important as all
points are drawn from the proximity of the object boundary. We postulate to
represent each cloud as a parameterized probability distribution defined by a
generative neural network. Once trained, such a model provides a natural
framework for point cloud manipulation operations, such as aligning a new cloud
into a default spatial orientation. To exploit similarities between same-class
objects and to improve model performance, we turn to weight sharing: networks
that model densities of points belonging to objects in the same family share
all parameters with the exception of a small, object-specific embedding vector.
We show that these embedding vectors capture semantic relationships between
objects. Our method leverages generative invertible flow networks to learn
embeddings as well as to generate point clouds. Thanks to this formulation and
contrary to similar approaches, we are able to train our model in an end-to-end
fashion. As a result, our model offers competitive or superior quantitative
results on benchmark datasets, while enabling unprecedented capabilities to
perform cloud manipulation tasks, such as point cloud registration and

regularizing automatically and by quantifying the uncertainty. We have
developed a novel technique to utilize the uncertainties provided by the
Bayesian-CNN that significantly improves the performance on a large fraction of
the test data (about 6% improvement in accuracy on 77% of test data). Further,
we provide a novel explanation for the uncertainty by projecting the data into
a low dimensional space through a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique.
This dimensionality reduction enables interpretation of the test data through
visualization and reveals the structure of the data in a low dimensional
feature space. We show that the Bayesian-CNN can perform much better than the
state-of-the-art transfer learning CNN (TL-CNN) by reducing the false negative
and false positive by 11% and 7.7% respectively for the present data set. It
achieves this performance with only 1.86 million parameters as compared to
134.33 million for TL-CNN. Besides, we modify the Bayesian-CNN by introducing a
stochastic adaptive activation function. The modified Bayesian-CNN performs
slightly better than Bayesian-CNN on all performance metrics and significantly
reduces the number of false negatives and false positives (3% reduction for
both). We also show that these results are statistically significant by
performing McNemar's statistical significance test. This work shows the

softmax iteratively on the entire vector of scores is avoided by using a
tournament-style selection. As a result, a much better approximation of top-k
with lower computational cost is achieved compared to the previous approach.

physics and unique application values due to their ability of integrating
stable boundary states at multiple dimensions in a single chip. However, for
signal-processing applications in high-frequency mechanical systems, the
current realizations of higher-order topological mechanical materials are still
limited to large-scale systems for kilohertz or lower frequencies. Here, we
report the experimental observation of a on-chip micromechanical metamaterial
as higher-order topological insulator for high-frequency mechanical waves. The
higher-order topological phononic band gap is induced by the band inversion at
the Brillouin zone corner which is achieved by configuring the orientations of
the elliptic pillars etched on the silicon chip. With consistent experiments
and theory, we demonstrate the coexistence of topological edge and corner
states in the megahertz frequency regime as induced by the higher-order band
topology. The experimental realization of on-chip micromechanical metamaterials
with higher-order topology opens a regime for applications based on megahertz
mechanical waves in an integrated platform where the edge and corner states act
as stable waveguides and resonators, respectively.
