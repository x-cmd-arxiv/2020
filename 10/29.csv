tidally induced by a hot Jupiter on a star to observable spectroscopic and
photometric signals. Models with both frozen convection and an approximation
for a perturbation to the convective flux are discussed. Observables are
calculated for some real planetary systems to give specific predictions.
Time-dependent line broadening and the radial velocity signal during transit
are both investigated as methods to provide further insight into the nature of
the stellar oscillations. The photometric signal is predicted to be
proportional to the inverse square of the orbital period, $P^{-2}$, as in the
equilibrium tide approximation. However, the radial velocity signal is
predicted to be proportional to $ P^{-1}$, and is therefore much larger at long
orbital periods than the signal corresponding to the equilibrium tide
approximation, which is proportional to $P^{-3}$. The prospects for detecting
these oscillations and the implications for the detection and characterisation
of planets are discussed.

self-driving cars and wearable health monitors rely on two important
techniques: input attribution for hindsight analysis and network compression to
reduce its size for edge-computing. In this paper, we show that these seemingly
unrelated techniques conflict with each other as network compression deforms
the produced attributions, which could lead to dire consequences for
mission-critical applications. This phenomenon arises due to the fact that
conventional network compression methods only preserve the predictions of the
network while ignoring the quality of the attributions. To combat the
attribution inconsistency problem, we present a framework that can preserve the
attributions while compressing a network. By employing the Weighted Collapsed
Attribution Matching regularizer, we match the attribution maps of the network

communication account for the emergence of only a very basic form of
compositionality: trivial compositionality. A compositional protocol is
trivially compositional if the meaning of a complex signal (e.g. blue circle)
boils down to the intersection of meanings of its constituents (e.g. the
intersection of the set of blue objects and the set of circles). A protocol is
non-trivially compositional (NTC) if the meaning of a complex signal (e.g.
biggest apple) is a more complex function of the meanings of their
constituents. In this paper, we review several metrics of compositionality used
in emergent communication and experimentally show that most of them fail to
detect NTC - i.e. they treat non-trivial compositionality as a failure of
compositionality. The one exception is tree reconstruction error, a metric
motivated by formal accounts of compositionality. These results emphasise
important limitations of emergent communication research that could hamper
progress on modelling the emergence of NTC.

framework that can be applied to all symmetric community properties. To ease
the challenges caused by the combinatorial nature of communities properties, we
develop a novel shadowing bootstrap testing method. By utilizing the symmetry,
our method can find a shadowing representative of the true assignment and the
number of assignments to be tested in the alternative can be largely reduced.
In theory, we introduce a combinatorial distance between two community classes
and show a combinatorial-probabilistic trade-off phenomenon in the community
properties test. Our test is honest as long as the product of combinatorial
distance between two communities and the probabilistic distance between two
assignment probabilities is sufficiently large. On the other hand, we shows
that such trade-off also exists in the information-theoretic lower bound of the
community property test. We also implement numerical experiments on both the

our method.

the halo model, we calculate the prediction of $\xi^{y-\kappa}$ (lensing
convergence and Compton-$y$ parameter) and $\xi^{y-\gamma_{\rm t}}$ (lensing
shear and Compton-$y$ parameter) and fit the UPP parameters by using the
observational data. We find consistent UPP parameters when fixing the cosmology
to either WMAP 9-year or Planck 2018 best-fitting values. The best constrained
parameter is the pressure profile concentration $c_{500}=r_{500}/r_{\rm s}$,
for which we find $c_{500} = 2.68^{+1.46}_{-0.96}$ (WMAP-9) and $c_{500} =
1.91^{+1.07}_{-0.65}$ (Planck-2018) for the $\xi^{y-\gamma_t}$ estimator. The
shape index for the intermediate radius region $\alpha$ parameter is
constrained to $\alpha=1.75^{+1.29}_{-0.77}$ and $\alpha = 1.65^{+0.74}_{-0.5}$
for WMAP-9 and Planck-2018 cosmologies, respectively. Propagating the
uncertainties of the UPP parameters to pressure profiles results in a factor of
$3$ uncertainty in the shape and magnitude. Further investigation shows that
most of the signal of the cross-correlation comes from the low-redshift, inner
halo profile ($r \leqslant r_{\rm vir}/2$) with halo mass in the range of
$10^{14}$--$10^{15}\,{\rm M}_{\odot}$, suggesting that this is the major regime

The first SP design estimates channel by treating data as interference, which
degrades its performance at high signal to noise ratio. The second SP design
alleviates this problem by iterating between channel estimation and data
detection. Both these designs detect data using message passing algorithm which
exploits OTFS channel sparsity, and consequently has low computational
complexity. We also derive a lower bound on the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio of the proposed designs, and maximize
it by optimally allocating power between data and pilot symbols. We numerically

which couples with temperature perturbations to create a self-generated

computing observed a rapid derivation of generative models during the last two
decades. Applications of such models include but are not limited to emotion
recognition and classification, unimodal emotion synthesis, and cross-modal
emotion synthesis. As a result, we conducted a review of recent advances in
human emotion synthesis by studying available databases, advantages, and
disadvantages of the generative models along with the related training
strategies considering two principal human communication modalities, namely
audio and video. In this context, facial expression synthesis, speech emotion
synthesis, and the audio-visual (cross-modal) emotion synthesis is reviewed
extensively under different application scenarios. Gradually, we discuss open
research problems to push the boundaries of this research area for future

the dynamical processes in blazar could be a combination of deterministic and

host stars, sometimes down to only $\sim 2$ stellar radii. These
ultra-short-period planets (USPs) likely did not form in their present-day
orbits, but rather migrated from larger initial separations. While tides are
the probable cause of this migration, the tidal source has remained uncertain.
Here we introduce planetary obliquity tides as a natural pathway for the
production of USPs within close-in multi-planet systems. The crucial idea is
that tidal dissipation generally forces planetary spin vectors to equilibrium
configurations called ""Cassini states"", in which the planetary obliquities
(axial tilts) are non-zero. In these cases, sustained tidal dissipation and
inward orbital migration are inevitable. Migration then increases the obliquity
and strengthens the tides, creating a positive feedback loop. Thus, if a
planet's initial semi-major axis is small enough ($a \lesssim 0.05$ AU), it can
experience runaway orbital decay, which is stalled at ultra-short orbital
periods when the forced obliquity reaches very high values ($\sim 85^{\circ}$)
and becomes unstable. We use secular dynamics to outline the parameter space in
which the innermost member of a prototypical Kepler multiple-planet system can
become a USP. We find that these conditions are consistent with many observed
features of USPs, such as period ratios, mutual inclinations, and occurrence
rate trends with stellar type. Future detections of stellar obliquities and
close-in companions, together with theoretical explorations of the potential
for chaotic obliquity dynamics, can help constrain the prevalence of this
mechanism.

finite-time analysis of this decentralized stochastic approximation method when

variables, only the second approach has been considered, i.e. the one based on
stem functions. In this paper, we use instead the first definition on the
so-called $n$-dimensional quadratic cone of octonions. These two approaches
yield the same class of slice regular functions on axially symmetric

calculations to examine the effect increasing the strength of the stellar wind
has on observed Ly-$\alpha$ transits of a Hot Jupiter (HJ) and a Warm Neptune
(WN). We find that increasing the stellar wind mass-loss rate from 0 (no wind)
to 100 times the solar mass-loss rate value causes reduced atmospheric escape
in both planets (a reduction of 65\% and 40\% for the HJ and WN, respectively,
compared to the ""no wind"" case). For weaker stellar winds (lower ram pressure),
the reduction in planetary escape rate is very small. However, as the stellar
wind becomes stronger, the interaction happens deeper in the planetary
atmosphere and, once this interaction occurs below the sonic surface of the
planetary outflow, further reduction in evaporation rates is seen. We classify
these regimes in terms of the geometry of the planetary sonic surface. ""Closed""
refers to scenarios where the sonic surface is undisturbed, while ""open"" refers
to those where the surface is disrupted. We find that the change in stellar
wind strength affects the Ly-$\alpha$ transit in a non-linear way. Although
little change is seen in planetary escape rates ($\simeq 5.5\times 10^{11}$g/s)
in the closed to partially open regimes, the Ly-$\alpha$ absorption (sum of the
blue [-300, -40 km/s] \& red [40, 300 km/s] wings) changes from 21\% to 6\% as
the stellar wind mass-loss rate is increased in the HJ set of simulations. For
the WN simulations, escape rates of $\simeq 6.5\times 10^{10}$g/s can cause
transit absorptions that vary from 8.8\% to 3.7\%, depending on the stellar
wind strength. We conclude that the same atmospheric escape rate can produce a
range of absorptions depending on the stellar wind and that neglecting this in
the interpretation of Ly-$\alpha$ transits can lead to underestimation of
planetary escape rates.

conserved on the relevant timescale of pattern formation. Thus, the essential
dynamics is the redistribution of the globally conserved mass densities between

polarity orientation. This reveals a close relation between cell polarity
oscillatory patterns in cells. Critically, our findings suggest that the design

features in these phase portraits (nullclines and fixed points). These features
are not uniquely determined by the topology of the protein-interaction network

importance of evaluating safety has increased. An important aspect of this is
evaluating how robust a model is to changes in setting or population, which
typically requires applying the model to multiple, independent datasets. Since
the cost of collecting such datasets is often prohibitive, in this paper, we
propose a framework for analyzing this type of stability using the available
data. We use the original evaluation data to determine distributions under
which the algorithm performs poorly, and estimate the algorithm's performance
on the ""worst-case"" distribution. We consider shifts in user defined
conditional distributions, allowing some distributions to shift while keeping
other portions of the data distribution fixed. For example, in a healthcare
context, this allows us to consider shifts in clinical practice while keeping
the patient population fixed. To address the challenges associated with
estimation in complex, high-dimensional distributions, we derive a ""debiased""
estimator which maintains $\sqrt{N}$-consistency even when machine learning
methods with slower convergence rates are used to estimate the nuisance
parameters. In experiments on a real medical risk prediction task, we show this
estimator can be used to analyze stability and accounts for realistic shifts
that could not previously be expressed. The proposed framework allows
practitioners to proactively evaluate the safety of their models without
requiring additional data collection.

linearization in ways that are poorly understood. We study the relationship
between the training dynamics of nonlinear deep networks, the geometry of the
loss landscape, and the time evolution of a data-dependent NTK. We do so
through a large-scale phenomenological analysis of training, synthesizing
diverse measures characterizing loss landscape geometry and NTK dynamics. In
multiple neural architectures and datasets, we find these diverse measures
evolve in a highly correlated manner, revealing a universal picture of the deep
learning process. In this picture, deep network training exhibits a highly
chaotic rapid initial transient that within 2 to 3 epochs determines the final
linearly connected basin of low loss containing the end point of training.
During this chaotic transient, the NTK changes rapidly, learning useful
features from the training data that enables it to outperform the standard
initial NTK by a factor of 3 in less than 3 to 4 epochs. After this rapid
chaotic transient, the NTK changes at constant velocity, and its performance
matches that of full network training in 15% to 45% of training time. Overall,
our analysis reveals a striking correlation between a diverse set of metrics
over training time, governed by a rapid chaotic to stable transition in the

exposure times roughly half that of a 20,000A--23,000A Ks filter). Moving the K

have resolved the decades-long puzzle of the anomalously slow apsidal
precession rate, but raise new questions regarding the origin of the
obliquities. This paper investigates obliquity evolution in stellar binaries
hosting modestly-inclined circumbinary disks. As the disk and binary axes
undergo mutual precession, each oblate star experiences a torque from its
companion star, so that the spin and orbital axes undergo mutual precession. As
the disk loses mass through a combination of winds and accretion, the system
may be captured into a high-obliquity Cassini state (a spin-orbit resonance).
The final obliquity depends on the details of the disk dispersal. We construct
a simple disk model to emulate disk dispersal due to viscous accretion and
photoevaporation, and identify the necessary disk properties for producing the
observed obliquities in DI Herculis. The disk must be massive (at least $10 \%$
of the binary mass). If accretion onto the binary is suppressed, the observed
high stellar obliquities are reproduced with a binary-disk inclination of $\sim
5^\circ - 10^\circ$, but if substantial accretion occurs, the inclination must
be larger, $\sim 20^\circ - 30^\circ$. If moderate accretion occurs, initially
the disk must lose its mass slowly, but eventually lose its remaining mass
abruptly, analogous to the observed two-timescale behavior for disks around
T-Tauri stars. The spin feedback on the binary orbit causes the binary-disk
inclination to decay as the obliquity evolves, a feature that is absent from
the standard Cassini state treatment.

find that this location may also be identified as the radius at which the
(stacked) velocity dispersion profile drops to 60% of its peak value (for
line-of-sight motions of stellar and dark matter particles in TNG halos). We
further show that the scatter in the velocity dispersion profiles may be
attributed to the variations in the assembly history of the host halos. In
particular, this segregates the profile into two regimes: one within
$\sim0.1r_{200m}$, where the scatter in the velocity dispersion within is set
by the early assembly history of the halo, and the other beyond this radius
where the scatter in the velocity dispersion is influenced more strongly by its
late-time assembly. Finally, we show that a two-parameter model can be used to
fit the measured velocity dispersion profiles and the fit parameters can be
related directly to two fundamental halo properties: mass and concentration. We
describe a simple model which allows us to express the stellar velocity
dispersion profile in terms of the mass and concentration of the host halo as
the only free parameters.

Diffuse X-ray emission from the hot gaseous halo around the galaxy is robustly
detected out to a radius of 160 kpc, corresponding roughly to 35 per cent of
the virial radius ($\approx 450$ kpc). We fit the X-ray emission with the
standard isothermal $\beta$ model, and it is found that the enclosed gas mass
within 160 kpc is $1.15_{-0.24}^{+0.22} \times 10^{11} \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$.
Extrapolating the gas mass profile out to the virial radius, the estimated gas
mass is $8.25_{-1.77}^{+1.62} \times 10^{11} \, \rm{M}_{\odot}$, which makes up
roughly 65 per cent of the total baryon mass content of the galaxy. When the
stellar mass is considered and accounting for the statistical and systematic
uncertainties, the baryon mass fraction within the virial radius is
$0.121_{-0.043}^{+0.043}$, in agreement with the universal baryon fraction. The
baryon mass fraction is consistent with all baryons falling within $r_{200}$,
or with only half of the baryons falling within $r_{200}$. Similar to the

red, luminous blue and faint blue populations dominate the total HIMF at the
high-mass end, knee and the low-mass end respectively. We use the conditional
HIMF to derive the underlying distribution function of $\Omega_{\text{HI}}$ (HI

$M_{\text{r}}^{\text{max}}=$ $-19.25, C_{\text{ur}}^{\text{max}}=1.44$ but is
skewed. It has a long tail towards faint blue galaxies and luminous red

properties in the interstellar medium (ISM). However, it does not provide a
direct measurement of its strength. Different methods havebeen developed which
employ both polarization and spectroscopic data in order to infer the field
strength. The most widely applied methods have been developed by Davis (1951),
Chandrasekhar & Fermi (1953) (DCF), Hildebrand et al. (2009) and Houde et
al.(2009) (HH09). They rely on the assumption that isotropic turbulent motions
initiate the propagation of Alvf\'en waves. Observations,however, indicate that
turbulence in the ISM is anisotropic and non-Alfv\'enic (compressible) modes
may be important. Our goal is to develop a new method for estimating the field
strength in the ISM, which includes the compressible modes and does not
contradict the anisotropic properties of turbulence. We use simple energetics
arguments that take into account the compressible modes to estimate the
strength of the magnetic field. We derive the following equation:
$B_{0}=\sqrt{2 \pi\rho} \delta v /\sqrt{\delta \theta}$, where $\rho$ is the
gas density, $\delta v$ is the rms velocity as derived from the spread of
emission lines, and $\delta \theta$ is the dispersion of polarization angles.
We produce synthetic observations from 3D MHD simulationsand we assess the
accuracy of our method by comparing the true field strength with the estimates
derived from our equation. We find a mean relative deviation of $17 \%$. The
accuracy of our method does not depend on the turbulence properties of the
simulated model. In contrast DCF and HH09 systematically overestimate the field
strength. HH09 produces accurate results only for simulations with high sonic
Mach numbers.

surveys, the most formidable of which will be the Legacy Survey of Space and
Time (LSST) to be conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. So new is the
field of systematic time-domain survey astronomy, however, that major
scientific insights will continue to be obtained using smaller, more flexible
systems than the LSST. One such example is the Gravitational-wave Optical
Transient Observer (GOTO), whose primary science objective is the optical
follow-up of Gravitational Wave events. The amount and rate of data production
by GOTO and other wide-area, high-cadence surveys presents a significant
challenge to data processing pipelines which need to operate in near real-time
to fully exploit the time-domain. In this study, we adapt the Rubin Observatory
LSST Science Pipelines to process GOTO data, thereby exploring the feasibility
of using this ""off-the-shelf"" pipeline to process data from other wide-area,
high-cadence surveys. In this paper, we describe how we use the LSST Science
Pipelines to process raw GOTO frames to ultimately produce calibrated coadded
images and photometric source catalogues. After comparing the measured
astrometry and photometry to those of matched sources from PanSTARRS DR1, we
find that measured source positions are typically accurate to sub-pixel levels,
and that measured L-band photometries are accurate to $\sim50$ mmag at
$m_L\sim16$ and $\sim200$ mmag at $m_L\sim18$. These values compare favourably
to those obtained using GOTO's primary, in-house pipeline, GOTOPHOTO, in spite
of both pipelines having undergone further development and improvement beyond
the implementations used in this study. Finally, we release a generic ""obs

evolution and composition of exoplanets. The transmission spectroscopy
technique is playing a significant role in this domain. In particular, the
combination of state-of-the-art spectrographs at low- and high-spectral
resolution is key to our understanding of atmospheric structure and
composition. Two transits of the close-in sub Saturn-mass planet,WASP-127b,
have been observed with ESPRESSO in the frame of the Guaranteed Time
Observations Consortium. Transit observations allow us to study simultaneously
the system architecture and the exoplanet atmosphere. We found that this planet
is orbiting its slowly rotating host star (veq sin(i)=0.53+/-0.07 km/s) on a
retrograde misaligned orbit (lambda=-128.41+/-5.60 deg). We detected the sodium
line core at the 9-sigma confidence level with an excess absorption of
0.3+/-0.04%, a blueshift of 2.7+/-0.79 km/s and a FWHM of 15.18+/-1.75 km/s.
However, we did not detect the presence of other atomic species but set
upper-limits of only few scale heights. Finally, we put a 3-sigma upper limit,
to the average depth of the 1600 strongest water lines at equilibrium
temperature in the visible band, of 38 ppm. This constrains the cloud-deck
pressure between 0.3 and 0.5 mbar by combining our data with low-resolution
data in the near-infrared and models computed for this planet. To conclude,
WASP-127b, with an age of about 10 Gyr, is an unexpected exoplanet by its
orbital architecture but also by the small extension of its sodium atmosphere
(~7 scale heights). ESPRESSO allows us to take a step forward in the detection
of weak signals, thus bringing strong constraints on the presence of clouds in
exoplanet atmospheres. The framework proposed in this work can be applied to
search for molecular species and study cloud-decks in other exoplanets.

operating at collisions energies of e.g. 20-200 GeV, 50-1000 GeV and 100-3000
GeV, would be able to probe charged lepton flavor violation and measure Higgs
boson properties precisely. The collision of an electron and muon beam leads to
less physics background compared with either an electron-electron or a
muon-muon collider, since electron-muon interactions proceed mostly through
higher order vector boson fusion and vector boson scattering processes. The
asymmetric collision profile results in collision products that are boosted
towards the electron beam side, which can be exploited to reduce beam-induced
background from the muon beam to a large extent. With this in mind, one can
imagine a lepton collider complex, starting from colliding order 10 GeV
electron and muon beams for the first time in history and to probe charged
lepton flavor violation, then to be upgraded to a collider with 50-100 GeV
electron and 1-3 TeV muon beams to measure Higgs properties and search for new

analytically obtain the spectra lensed on different plasma density profiles.
With these tools, we reanalyze the highest frequency 4-8 GHz data of Gajjar et
al. (2018) for the repeating FRB 20121102A (FRB 121102). In the data we
discover, first, a remarkable spectral structure of almost equidistant peaks
separated by $95\pm 16$ MHz. We suggest that it can originate from diffractive
lensing of the FRB signals on a compact gravitating object of mass $10^{-4}\,
M_\odot$ or on a plasma underdensity near the source. Second, the spectra
include erratic interstellar, presumably Milky Way scintillations. We extract
their decorrelation bandwidth $3.3\pm 0.6$ MHz at reference frequency 6 GHz.
The third feature is a GHz-scale pattern which, as we find, linearly drifts
with time and presumably represents a wide-band propagation effect, e.g.
GHz-scale scintillations. Fourth, many spectra are dominated by a narrow peak
at 7.1 GHz. We suggest that it can be caused by a propagation through a plasma
lens, e.g., in the host galaxy. Fifth, separating the propagation effects, we
give strong arguments that the intrinsic progenitor spectrum has narrow GHz
bandwidth and variable central frequency. This confirms expectations from the
previous observations. We discuss alternative interpretations of the above
spectral features.

by a dynamical instability among the giant planets. During the instability a
primordial outer disk of planetesimals was destabilized and ended up on
planet-crossing orbits. Most planetesimals were ejected into interstellar space
but a fraction were trapped on stable orbits in the Kuiper belt and Oort cloud.
We use a suite of N-body simulations to map out the diversity of planetesimals'
dynamical pathways. We focus on two processes: tidal disruption from very close
encounters with a giant planet, and loss of surface volatiles from repeated
passages close to the Sun. We show that the rate of tidal disruption is more
than a factor of two higher for ejected planetesimals than for surviving
objects in the Kuiper belt or Oort cloud. Ejected planetesimals are
preferentially disrupted by Jupiter and surviving ones by Neptune. Given that
the gas giants contracted significantly as they cooled but the ice giants did
not, taking into account the thermal evolution of the giant planets decreases
the disruption rate of ejected planetesimals. The frequency of volatile loss
and extinction is far higher for ejected planetesimals than for surviving ones
and is not affected by the giant planets' contraction. Even if all interstellar
objects were ejected from Solar System-like systems, our analysis suggests that
their physical properties should be more diverse than those of Solar System
small bodies as a result of their divergent dynamical histories. This is
consistent with the characteristics of the two currently-known interstellar
objects.

gapped case, we argue that fractonic excitations are mobile along the wire
direction, but their mobility in the transverse plane is generally reduced. We
show that the excitations in general have infinite-order fusion structure,
distinct from previously known gapped fracton models. Like the 2D coupled wire
constructions, many models exhibit gapless (or even chiral) surface states,
which can be described by infinite-component Luttinger liquids. However, the
universality class of the surface theory strongly depends on the surface

eccentricity as a smoking-gun for new physics. We find that: i) backreaction
from radiative mechanisms, including scalars, vectors and gravitational waves
circularize the orbital motion. ii) by contrast, environmental effects such as
accretion and dynamical friction increase the eccentricity of binaries. Thus,
it is the competition between radiative mechanisms and environmental effects
that dictates the eccentricity evolution. We study this competition within an
adiabatic approach, including gravitational radiation and dynamical friction
forces. We show that that there is a critical semi-major axis below which
gravitational radiation dominates the motion and the eccentricity of the system
decreases. However, the eccentricity inherited from the environment-dominated

radiative-convective equilibrium for a variety of nitrogen-rich cases and
orbital parameters. We demonstrate the effects caused by thermal inversions on
the chemistry and compute low resolution synthetic emission spectra for a range
of 0.5 - 28 micron. Our results indicate that dueto shortwave absorption of CN,
atmospheres with temperatures above 2000 K and C/O $\geq$ 1.0 are prone to
thermal inversions. CN is one of the few molecules that is extremely stable at
large temperatures occurring on the day side of short period super-Earths. The
emission spectrum of such atmospheres will differ substantially from
non-inverted cases. In the case of inversions, absorption features become
inverted, showing higher than expected flux. We propose that inversions in hot
atmospheres should be the expected norm. Hot super-Earths are some of the most
extreme natural laboratories for testing predictions of atmospheric chemistry
and structure. They are frequently occurring, bright in emission and have short
orbital periods. All these factors make them perfect candidates to be observed

In addition to the $SU(2)$ symmetric spin mode, these include also the valley
imbalance modes obeying a $U(1)$ symmetry, and a $U(2)$ symmetric valley spin

computationally intense task -- the summation of a kernel function over
$O(N^2)$ pairs of points. One popular technique is the Kernel Independent Fast
Multipole Method (KIFMM), which constructs a spatial adaptive octree for all
points and places a small number of equivalent multipole and local equivalent
points around each octree box, and completes the kernel sum with $O(N)$ cost,
using these equivalent points. Simpler kernels can be used between these
equivalent points to improve the efficiency of KIFMM. Here we present further
extensions and applications to this idea, to enable efficient summations and
flexible boundary conditions for various kernels. We call our method the Kernel
Aggregated Fast Multipole Method (KAFMM), because it uses different kernel
functions at different stages of octree traversal. We have implemented our
method as an open-source software library STKFMM based on the high performance
library PVFMM, with support for Laplace kernels, the Stokeslet, regularized
Stokeslet, Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) tensor, and the Stokes double-layer and
traction operators. Open and periodic boundary conditions are supported for all
kernels, and the no-slip wall boundary condition is supported for the Stokeslet
and RPY tensor. The package is designed to be ready-to-use as well as being
readily extensible to additional kernels.

adding new data sources with different diagnostics enriches our knowledge about

making relations among variables more and more opaque. A new approach for the

integrating the soft X-ray linear images of plasma temperature with the

  However to ensure a real-time signal analysis, those algorithmic techniques
must be adapted to run in well suited hardware. In particular it is shown that,
attempting a quantization of neurons transfer functions, such models can be
modified to create an embedded firmware. This firmware, approximating the deep

care of resource management tasks such as resource provisioning, deployment,
and auto-scaling. The only resource management task that developers are still
in charge of is selecting how much resources are allocated to each worker
instance. However, selecting the optimal size of serverless functions is quite
challenging, so developers often neglect it despite its significant cost and
performance benefits. Existing approaches aiming to automate serverless
functions resource sizing require dedicated performance tests, which are
time-consuming to implement and maintain. In this paper, we introduce an
approach to predict the optimal resource size of a serverless function using
monitoring data from a single resource size. As our approach does not require
dedicated performance tests, it enables cloud providers to implement resource
sizing on a platform level and automate the last resource management task
associated with serverless functions. We evaluate our approach on three
different serverless applications, where it selects the optimal memory size for
71.7% of the serverless functions and the second-best memory size for 22.3% of
the serverless functions, which results in an average speedup of 43.6% while
simultaneously decreasing average costs by 10.2%.

terms of latency-reliability or Age of Information (AoI). We evaluate the

that of OMA, which indicates that it may offer significant benefits in
practical deployments where the capture effect is frequently encountered. On
the other hand, finding the optimal configuration of NOMA with SIC depends on
the activity pattern of the intermittent user, to which OMA is insensitive.

separation (\textgreater 11 particle diameters), beyond which the net work
plateaued. This peak was likely due to less particle flow between intruders as
we found a larger number of strong forces---identified as force chains---in the
particle domain at gaps surrounding the peak force. Although higher friction
caused greater force generation during intrusion, the gap spacing between the
intruders at which the peak work was generated remained unchanged. Larger
intruder sizes resulted in greater net work with the peak in $W$ occurring at
slightly larger intruder separations. Taken together, our results show that
peak work done by two parallel intruders remained within a narrow range,
remaining robust to most other tested parameters.

which are both related to a smooth transition in speech segments that may carry
linguistic information, e.g. phones and syllables. In this study, we propose a
novel phone-fortified perceptual loss (PFPL) that takes phonetic information
into account for training SE models. To effectively incorporate the phonetic
information, the PFPL is computed based on latent representations of the
wav2vec model, a powerful self-supervised encoder that renders rich phonetic
information. To more accurately measure the distribution distances of the
latent representations, the PFPL adopts the Wasserstein distance as the
distance measure. Our experimental results first reveal that the PFPL is more
correlated with the perceptual evaluation metrics, as compared to signal-level
losses. Moreover, the results showed that the PFPL can enable a deep complex
U-Net SE model to achieve highly competitive performance in terms of
standardized quality and intelligibility evaluations on the Voice Bank-DEMAND

Using recent advances in automatic differentiation, we show how kinetic

statistical-physics models, namely free energy calculations and molecular
dynamics simulations. We consider two systems that are crucial to our
understanding of structural self-assembly: bulk crystallization and small
nanoclusters. In each case we are able to assemble precise dynamical features.
Using gradient information, we manipulate interactions among constituent
particles to tune the rate at which these systems yield specific structures of
interest. Moreover, we use this approach to learn non-trivial features about
the high-dimensional design space, allowing us to accurately predict when
multiple kinetic features can be simultaneously and independently controlled.
These results provide a concrete and generalizable foundation for studying
non-structural self-assembly, including kinetic properties as well as other
complex emergent properties, in a vast array of systems.

outburst. The emergence of a low-frequency excess in the spectral energy
distribution in the form of a red excess above the disc spectrum (seen most
prominently in z, i and R-bands) is observed as the outburst evolves. This is
indicative of optically thin synchrotron emission due to a jet, as seen
previously in this source and in other AMXPs during outburst. At the end of the
outburst decay, the source entered a reflaring state. The low-frequency excess
is still observed during the reflares. Our optical (BVRI) polarimetric campaign
shows variable linear polarization (LP) throughout the outburst. We show that
this is intrinsic to the source, with low-level but significant detections
(0.2-2%) in all bands. The LP spectrum is red during both the main outburst and
the reflaring state, favoring a jet origin for this variable polarization over
other interpretations, such as Thomson scattering with free electrons from the
disc or the propelled matter. During the reflaring state, a few episodes with
stronger LP level (1-2 %) are observed. The low-level, variable LP is
suggestive of strongly tangled magnetic fields near the base of the jet. These
results clearly demonstrate how polarimetry is a powerful tool for probing the
magnetic field structure in X-ray binary jets, similar to AGN jets.

consistent with its moderate dust temperature. A high density, high kinetic
temperature gas component embedded in the gas reservoir is required to fully
explain the CO line ladder. This component is likely associated with the

only (140+/-13) km/s along the line of sight and 9.0 kpc in projection. The

is also the one that is more enshrouded in dust and thus remains undetected up

of the OH+ line is blueshifted and peaks near the CO and continuum emission
peak while the emission is redshifted and peaks offset by 1.7 kpc from the CO

massive molecular outflow from the intensely star-forming nucleus that supplies
125 Msun/yr of enriched gas to its halo.

filamentary plasticity and background conductivity enhancement are reported,
suggesting that device behaviour might be best described by composite core

current measurements demonstrate an interplay between filament formation and
rupture, resulting in current-controlled voltage spiking in nanoscale regions,

state. At sufficiently late times in this process of reaching equilibrium, we
expect that the black hole is modeled as a perturbation around the final state.
The emitted gravitational waves will then be damped sinusoids with frequencies
and damping times given by the quasinormal mode spectrum of the final Kerr
black hole. An observational test of this scenario, often referred to as black
hole spectroscopy, is one of the major goals of gravitational wave astronomy.
It was recently suggested that the quasinormal mode description including the
higher overtones might hold even right after the remnant black hole is first
formed. At these times, the black hole is expected to be highly dynamical and
nonlinear effects are likely to be important. In this paper we investigate this
remarkable scenario in terms of the horizon dynamics. Working with high
accuracy simulations of a simple configuration, namely the head-on collision of
two nonspinning black holes with unequal masses, we study the dynamics of the
final common horizon in terms of its shear and its multipole moments. We show
that they are indeed well described by a superposition of ringdown modes as
long as a sufficiently large number of higher overtones are included. This
description holds even for the highly dynamical final black hole shortly after
its formation. We discuss the implications and caveats of this result for black
hole spectroscopy and for our understanding of the approach to equilibrium.

integrating this modified equation with a stabilized explicit scheme we devise
a multirate method which overcomes the bottleneck caused by a few severely
stiff terms and recovers the efficiency of stabilized schemes for large systems
of nonlinear SDEs. The scheme is not based on any scale separation assumption
of the SDE and therefore it is employable for problems stemming from the

on locally refined grids. The multirate scheme has strong order 1/2, weak order
1 and its stability is proved on a model problem. Numerical experiments confirm
the efficiency and accuracy of the scheme.

sample-efficiency challenges for reinforcement learning (RL) agents learning
from sparse task rewards. To alleviate these challenges, prior work has
provided extensive supervision via a combination of reward-shaping,
ground-truth object-information, and expert demonstrations. In this work, we
show that one can learn object-interaction tasks from scratch without
supervision by learning an attentive object-model as an auxiliary task during
task learning with an object-centric relational RL agent. Our key insight is
that learning an object-model that incorporates object-attention into forward
prediction provides a dense learning signal for unsupervised representation
learning of both objects and their relationships. This, in turn, enables faster
policy learning for an object-centric relational RL agent. We demonstrate our
agent by introducing a set of challenging object-interaction tasks in the
AI2Thor environment where learning with our attentive object-model is key to
strong performance. Specifically, we compare our agent and relational RL agents
with alternative auxiliary tasks to a relational RL agent equipped with
ground-truth object-information, and show that learning with our object-model
best closes the performance gap in terms of both learning speed and maximum
success rate. Additionally, we find that incorporating object-attention into an
object-model's forward predictions is key to learning representations which

particular, we consider the problem of optimal observation sensor placement for
Bayesian inference of high-dimensional parameters governed by partial
differential equations (PDEs), which is formulated as an optimization problem
that seeks to maximize an expected information gain (EIG). Such optimization
problems are particularly challenging due to the curse of dimensionality for
high-dimensional parameters and the expensive solution of large-scale PDEs. To
address these challenges, we exploit two essential properties of such problems:
the low-rank structure of the Jacobian of the parameter-to-observable map to
extract the intrinsically low-dimensional data-informed subspace, and the high
correlation of the approximate EIGs by a series of approximations to reduce the
number of PDE solves. We propose an efficient offline-online decomposition for
the optimization problem: an offline stage of computing all the quantities that
require a limited number of PDE solves independent of parameter and data
dimensions, and an online stage of optimizing sensor placement that does not
require any PDE solve. For the online optimization, we propose a swapping
greedy algorithm that first construct an initial set of sensors using leverage
scores and then swap the chosen sensors with other candidates until certain
convergence criteria are met. We demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of
the proposed computational framework by a linear inverse problem of inferring
the initial condition for an advection-diffusion equation, and a nonlinear

  We present Rosella, a new self-driving, distributed approach for task
scheduling in heterogeneous clusters. Rosella automatically learns the compute
environment and adjusts its scheduling policy in real-time. The solution
provides high throughput and low latency simultaneously because it runs in
parallel on multiple machines with minimum coordination and only performs
simple operations for each scheduling decision. Our learning module monitors
total system load and uses the information to dynamically determine optimal
estimation strategy for the backends' compute-power. Rosella generalizes
power-of-two-choice algorithms to handle heterogeneous workers, reducing the
max queue length of O(log n) obtained by prior algorithms to O(log log n). We
evaluate Rosella with a variety of workloads on a 32-node AWS cluster.

measurable outcomes (e.g. yield, shape) from performed experiments can help
guide the future design of experiments and development of simulation codes, to

registers. We show that in general this is not so: roughly speaking, every
randomized algorithm A has a corresponding algorithm A' that solves the same
problem if the registers that it uses are atomic or strongly-linearizable, but
does not terminate if these registers are replaced with ""merely"" linearizable
ones. Together with a previous result shown in [15], this implies that one
cannot use the well-known ABD implementation of registers in message-passing
systems to automatically transform any randomized algorithm that works in
shared-memory systems into a randomized algorithm that works in message-passing
systems: with a strong adversary the resulting algorithm may not terminate.

  Possibility",,,,,"math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In a series of recent papers, Damiano Brigo, Andrea Pallavicini, and
co-authors have shown that the value of a contract in a Credit Valuation
Adjustment (CVA) setting, being the sum of the cash flows, can be represented
as a solution of a decoupled forward-backward stochastic differential equation
(FBSDE). CVA is the difference between the risk-free portfolio value and the
true portfolio value that takes into account the possibility of a counter
party's default. In other words, CVA is the market value of counter party
credit risk. This has achieved noteworthy importance after the 2008 financial
debacle, where counter party risk played an under-modeled but huge risk. In
their analysis, Brigo et al make the classical assumption of conditional
independence of the default times, given the risk free market filtration. This
does not allow for the increasingly likely case of simultaneous defaults. We
weaken their assumption, replacing it with a martingale orthogonality
condition. This in turn changes the form of the BSDE that arises from the

a present-day galaxy was typically imprinted. Studies of galaxy populations at
different redshifts reveal that the balance of morphologies has changed over
time, but such snapshots cannot uncover the typical timescales over which
individual galaxies undergo morphological transformation, nor which are the
progenitors of today's galaxies of different types. However, these studies also
show a strong link between morphology and star-formation rate over a large
range in redshift, which offers an alternative probe of morphological
transformation. We therefore derive the evolution in star-formation rate and
stellar mass of a sample of 4342 galaxies in the SDSS-IV MaNGA survey through a
stellar population ""fossil record"" approach, and show that the average
evolution of the population shows good agreement with known behaviour from
previous studies. Although the correlation between a galaxy's contemporaneous
morphology and star-formation rate is strong over a large range of lookback
times, we find that a galaxy's present-day morphology only correlates with its
relatively recent (~2 Gyr) star-formation history. We therefore find strong
evidence that morphological transitions to galaxies' current appearance
occurred on timescales as short as a few billion years.

was conjectured that its order parameter (OP) has a form similar to that
realized in the superfluid He-3, namely, odd parity and spin triplet. The
chiral p-wave pairing realized in He-3 A-phase was favored by several early
experiments, in particular, the muon spin rotation and the Knight shift
measurements published in 1998. However, the original Knight shift result was
called into question in early 2019, raising the question as to whether the
chiral p-wave, or even the spin-triplet pairing itself, is indeed realized in
SRO. In this brief pedagogical review, we will address this question by
counterposing the currently accepted results of Knight shift, polarized neutron
scattering (PNS), spin counterflow half-quantum vortex (HQV), and Josephson
experiments with predictions made both by standard BCS theory and by more
general arguments based only on (1) the symmetry of the Hamiltonian including
the spin-orbital terms, (2) thermodynamics, and (3) the qualitative
experimental features of SRO. We also introduce a notation for triplet states
alternative to the more popular d-vector one which we believe well suited to
SRO. We conclude that the most recent Knight shift and PNS experiments do not
exclude in the bulk the odd-parity, spin-triplet ""helical"" states allowed by
the symmetry group of SRO but do exclude the chiral p-wave state. On the other
hand, the Josephson and the HQV experiments showed that the pairing in SRO
cannot be of the even-parity, spin-singlet type, and in the surface region or
in samples of mesoscopic size, the d-vector must have a c-axis component, thus
excluding apparently all bulk p-wave states except the chiral p-wave. Possible
resolution of this rather glaring prima facie contradiction is discussed,
taking into account other important experiments on SRO touched upon only
briefly in this article.

prostatectomy specimen sections, 40 patients were unlabelled. A non-local Mask
R-CNN was proposed to improve the segmentation accuracy. Transfer learning was
investigated by fine-tuning a model trained using MRI-based delineations with
prostatectomy-based delineations. Two label selection strategies were
investigated in self-training. The performance of models was evaluated by 3D
detection rate, dice similarity coefficient (DSC), 95 percentile Hausdrauff (95
HD, mm) and true positive ratio (TPR).
  Results: With prostatectomy-based delineations, the non-local Mask R-CNN with
fine-tuning and self-training significantly improved all evaluation metrics.
For the model with the highest detection rate and DSC, 80.5% (33/41) of lesions
in all Gleason Grade Groups (GGG) were detected with DSC of 0.548[0.165], 95 HD
of 5.72[3.17] and TPR of 0.613[0.193]. Among them, 94.7% (18/19) of lesions
with GGG > 2 were detected with DSC of 0.604[0.135], 95 HD of 6.26[3.44] and
TPR of 0.580[0.190].
  Conclusion: DL models can achieve high prostate cancer detection and
segmentation accuracy on bp-MRI based on annotations from histologic images. To
further improve the performance, more data with annotations of both MRI and
whole amount prostatectomy specimens are required.

in detail, the influence of the environment on the morphology and quenching of
galaxies in dense environments. We study the Hydra cluster galaxies in the
inner regions ($1R_{200}$) of the cluster using data from the Southern
Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS), which uses 12 narrow and broad band
filters in the visible region of the spectrum. We analyse structural (S\'ersic
index, effective radius) and physical (colours, stellar masses and star
formation rates) properties. Based on this analysis, we find that $\sim$88
percent of the Hydra cluster galaxies are quenched. Using the
Dressler-Schectman test approach, we also find that the cluster shows possible
substructures. Our analysis of the phase-space diagram together with DBSCAN
algorithm indicates that Hydra shows an additional substructure that appears to
be in front of the cluster centre, which is still falling into it. Our results,
thus, suggest that the Hydra Cluster might not be relaxed. We analyse the
median S\'ersic index as a function of wavelength and find that for red
($(u-r)\geq$2.3) and early-type galaxies it displays a slight increase towards
redder filters (13 and 18 percent, for red and early-type respectively) whereas
for blue+green ($(u-r)$<2.3) galaxies it remains constant. Late-type galaxies
show a small decrease of the median S\'ersic index toward redder filters. Also,
the S\'ersic index of galaxies, and thus their structural properties, do not
significantly vary as a function of clustercentric distance and density within
the cluster; and this is the case regardless of the filter.

to keep up with new requirements that challenge traditional solutions. Just to
mention one out of many possible examples, technologies such as Virtual LANs

introduced by Internet of Things (IoT) use cases. To keep up with these
challenges we have identified four main requirements that are common across
modern enterprise networks: (i) scalable mobility, (ii) endpoint segmentation,
(iii) simplified administration, and (iv) resource optimization. To address
these challenges we designed SDA (Software Defined Access), a solution for
modern enterprise networks that leverages Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and
other state of the art techniques. In this paper we present the design,
implementation and evaluation of SDA. Specifically, SDA: (i) leverages a
combination of an overlay approach with an event-driven protocol (LISP) to
dynamically adapt to traffic and mobility patterns while preserving resources,
and (ii) enforces dynamic endpoint groups for scalable segmentation with low
operational burden. We present our experience with deploying SDA in two
real-life scenarios: an enterprise campus, and a large warehouse with mobile
robots. Our evaluation shows that SDA, when compared with traditional
enterprise networks, can (i) reduce overall data plane forwarding state up to
70% thanks to a reactive protocol using a centralized routing server, and (ii)
reduce by an order of magnitude the handover delays in scenarios of massive
mobility with respect to other approaches. Finally, we discuss lessons learned
while deploying and operating SDA, and possible optimizations regarding the use
of an event-driven protocol and group-based segmentation.

on high-speed trains and vehicles, has become a norm rather than an exception.
However, the 4G/5G mobile network is not always reliable to meet this demand,
with non-negligible failures during the handover between base stations. A
fundamental challenge of reliability is to balance the exploration of more
measurements for satisfactory handover, and exploitation for timely handover
(before the fast-moving user leaves the serving base station's radio coverage).
This paper formulates this trade-off in extreme mobility as a composition of
two distinct multi-armed bandit problems. We propose Bandit and Threshold
Tuning (BATT) to minimize the regret of handover failures in extreme mobility.
BATT uses $\epsilon$-binary-search to optimize the threshold of the serving
cell's signal strength to initiate the handover procedure with
$\mathcal{O}(\log J \log T)$ regret.It further devises opportunistic Thompson
sampling, which optimizes the sequence of the target cells to measure for
reliable handover with $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret.Our experiment over a real
LTE dataset from Chinese high-speed rails validates significant regret
reduction and a 29.1% handover failure reduction.

emission, low noise level, etc. Different from a passenger car, the weight of a
city bus varies significantly with different amounts of onboard passengers.
After analyzing the importance of battery aging and passenger load effects on
an optimal energy management strategy, this study introduces the passenger load
prediction into the hybrid-electric city buses energy management problem, which
is not well studied in the existing literature. The average model, Decision
Tree, Gradient Boost Decision Tree, and Neural Networks models are compared in
the passenger load prediction. The Gradient Boost Decision Tree model is
selected due to its best accuracy and high stability. Given the predicted
passenger load, a dynamic programming algorithm determines the optimal power
demand for supercapacitor and battery by optimizing the battery aging and
energy usage leveraging cloud techniques. Then, rule extraction is conducted on
dynamic programming results, and the rule is real-time loaded to the vehicle
onboard controller to handle prediction errors and uncertainties. The proposed
cloud-based Dynamic Programming and rule extraction framework with the
passenger load prediction show 4% and 11% lower bus operating costs in off-peak

less than 1% of the dynamic programming with the true passenger load

integer-quantized topological charge pumping in optical lattices. Motivated by
this progress, we study the effects of static disorder on topological Thouless
charge pumping. We focus on the half-filled Rice-Mele model of free spinless
fermions and consider random diagonal disorder. In the instantaneous basis, we
compute the polarization, the entanglement spectrum, and the local Chern
marker. As a first main result, we conclude that the space-integrated local
Chern marker is best suited for a quantitative determination of topological
transitions in a disordered system. In the time-dependent simulations, we use
the time-integrated current to obtain the pumped charge in slowly periodically
driven systems. As a second main result, we observe and characterize a
disorder-driven breakdown of the quantized charge pump. There is an excellent
agreement between the static and the time-dependent ways of computing the
pumped charge. The topological transition occurs well in the regime where all
states are localized on the given system sizes and is therefore not tied to a
delocalization-localization transition of Hamiltonian eigenstates. For
individual disorder realizations, the breakdown of the quantized pumping occurs
for parameters where the spectral bulk gap inherited from the band gap of the
clean system closes, leading to a globally gapless spectrum. As a third main
result and with respect to the analysis of finite-size systems, we show that
the disorder average of the bulk gap severely overestimates the stability of
quantized pumping. A much better estimate is the typical value of the
distribution of energy gaps, also called mode of the distribution.

performing their own tasks, predictable paths taken by mobile robots can not
only make the environment feel safer, but humans can also help with the
navigation in the space by avoiding path conflicts or not blocking the way. So
predictable paths become vital. The cognitive effort for the human to predict
the robot's path becomes untenable as the number of robots increases. As the
number of humans increase, it also makes it harder for the robots to move while
considering the motion of multiple humans. Additionally, if new people are
entering the space -- like in restaurants, banks, and hospitals -- they would
have less familiarity with the trajectories typically taken by the robots; this
further increases the needs for predictable robot motion along paths.
  With this in mind, we propose to minimize the navigation-graph of the robot
for position-based predictability, which is predictability from just the
current position of the robot. This is important since the human cannot be
expected to keep track of the goals and prior actions of the robot in addition
to doing their own tasks. In this paper, we define measures for position-based
predictability, then present and evaluate a hill-climbing algorithm to minimize
the navigation-graph (directed graph) of robot motion. This is followed by the

thermodynamics, it is less clear whether the same holds in the presence of
strong correlations, especially in the case of quantum systems, which may even
display correlations with no classical analogue. The problem lies in the fact
that, under the presence of strong correlations, subsystems of a system in
thermal equilibrium are, in general, not described by a thermal state at the
same temperature as the global system and thus one cannot simply assign a local
temperature to them. However, there have been identified situations in which
correlations in thermal states decay sufficiently fast so that the state of
their subsystems can be very well approximated by the reduced states of
equilibrium systems that are only slightly bigger than the subsystems
themselves, hence allowing for a valid local definition of temperature. In this
work, we address the question of whether temperature is locally well defined
for a bosonic system with local interactions that undergoes a phase transition
at non-zero temperature. We consider a three-dimensional bosonic model in the
grand canonical state and verify that a certain form of locality of temperature
holds regardless of the temperature, and despite the presence of infinite-range
correlations at and below the critical temperature of the phase transition.

value function approximation remains fundamentally incomplete. Prior work has
identified a variety of pathological behaviours that arise in RL algorithms
that combine approximate on-policy evaluation and greedification. One prominent
example is policy oscillation, wherein an algorithm may cycle indefinitely
between policies, rather than converging to a fixed point. What is not well
understood however is the quality of the policies in the region of oscillation.
In this paper we present simple examples illustrating that in addition to
policy oscillation and multiple fixed points -- the same basic issue can lead
to convergence to the worst possible policy for a given approximation. Such
behaviours can arise when algorithms optimize evaluation accuracy weighted by
the distribution of states that occur under the current policy, but greedify
based on the value of states which are rare or nonexistent under this
distribution. This means the values used for greedification are unreliable and
can steer the policy in undesirable directions. Our observation that this can
lead to the worst possible policy shows that in a general sense such algorithms
are unreliable. The existence of such examples helps to narrow the kind of
theoretical guarantees that are possible and the kind of algorithmic ideas that
are likely to be helpful. We demonstrate analytically and experimentally that
such pathological behaviours can impact a wide range of RL and dynamic
programming algorithms; such behaviours can arise both with and without
bootstrapping, and with linear function approximation as well as with more
complex parameterized functions like neural networks.

1) learning a disentangled representation using $\beta$-VAE to denoise the

re-mapping to various clinical labels, allowing clinicians to re-use a single
EEG representation regardless of updates to the standardized diagnostic system.
Finally, single factors of the learned disentangled representations often

problems is developed, based on the transmutation operator approach, new
Neumann series of Bessel functions representations for solutions and the
Gelfand-Levitan equation. The method allows one to reduce the inverse
Sturm-Liouville problem directly to a system of linear algebraic equations,
such that the potential is recovered from the first element of the solution

description of the associated states that form Jordan blocks remained to be
studied. We present a set of six operators $\{A^{\pm},B^{\pm},C^{\pm}\}$ that
can be combined to build a ${\mathfrak{gl}}(3)$ hidden algebra. The latter can
be embedded in an ${\mathfrak{sp}}(6)$ algebra, as well as in an
${\mathfrak{osp}}(1/6)$ superalgebra. The states associated with the
eigenstates and making Jordan blocks are induced in different ways by
combinations of operators acting on the ground state. We present the action of
these operators and study the construction of an extended biorthogonal basis.
These rely on establishing various nontrivial polynomial and commutator
identities. We also make a connection between the hidden symmetry and the
underlying superintegrability property of the model. Interestingly, the
integrals generate a cubic algebra. This work demonstrates how various concepts
that have been applied widely to Hermitian Hamiltonians, such as hidden

tides for a variety of WD models with effective temperatures ranging from
$T$=10 kK to $T$=26 kK. At linear order, we find the dynamical tide can
significantly perturb the observed flux in hot WDs. If the temperature
$T\gtrsim14$ kK, then the dynamical tide may induce a fractional change in the
flux by >1% when the orbital period is $P_{\rm orb}\simeq 20-60\,{\rm min}$.
The ratio between the flux modulation due to the dynamical tide and that due to
the equilibrium tide (i.e., ellipsoidal variability) increases as the WD's
radius decreases, and it could exceed O(10) if the WD has a radius
$R\lesssim0.03 R_\odot$. Unlike the ellipsoidal variability which is in phase
with the orbital motion, the pulsation caused by the dynamical tide may have a
substantial phase shift. A cold WD with $T\lesssim 10$ kK, on the other hand,
is unlikely to show observable pulsations due to the dynamical tide. At shorter
orbital periods, the dynamical tide may become highly nonlinear. We approximate
this regime by treating the waves as one-way traveling waves and find the flux
variation is typically reduced to 0.1%-1% and the excess phase is likely to be
90 degrees (though with large uncertainty). Even in the traveling-wave limit,
the flux perturbation due to dynamical tide could still exceed the ellipsoidal
variability for compact WDs with $R\lesssim0.02 R_\odot$. We further estimate
the nonlinear flux perturbations oscillating at four times the orbital
frequency dominated by a self-coupled parent g-mode driving low-order daughter
p-modes. The nonlinear flux variation could be nearly 50% of the linear
variation for very hot WD models with $T\gtrsim26$ kK and 1% linear flux
variation. We thus predict both the linear and nonlinear flux variations due to
dynamical tides are likely to have significant observational signatures.

of blazars. In the model, we introduce time-dependent electric and magnetic
fields, which consistently include the variability of relevant physical
quantities in the transport equation. The evolution on the electron
distribution is numerically solved from a generalized transport equation that
contains the terms describing the electrostatic, first-order and second-order
\emph{Fermi} acceleration, escape of particles due to both advection and
spatial diffusion, as well as energy losses due to the synchrotron emission and
inverse-Compton scattering of both synchrotron and external ambient photon
fields. We find that the light curve profiles of blazars are consistent with
the particle spectral evolution resulting from time-dependent electric and
magnetic fields, rather than the effects of the acceleration or the cooling
processes. The proposed model is able to simultaneously account for the
variability of both the energy spectrum and the light curve profile of the BL
Lac object Mrk 421 with reasonable assumptions about the physical parameters.
The results strongly indicate that the magnetic field evolution in the

a brane in a deformed and backreated AdS-Schwarzschild spacetime. This space is
a solution of Einstein-dilaton equations and contains a conformal exponential
factor $\exp(k/r^2)$ in the metric. We consider the backreaction contributions
coming only from the exponential warp factor on the AdS-Schwarzschild black
hole, where the string and brane are in the probe approximation.
  Within this Lorentz invariant holographic model we have computed the
admittance, the diffusion coefficient, the two-point functions and the
regularized mean square displacement $s^2_{reg}$. From this quantity we obtain
the diffuse and ballistic regimes characteristic of the Brownian motion. From
the two-point functions and the admittance, we also have checked the well know
fluctuation-dissipation theorem in this set up.

employing the Helmholtz decomposition on the noise function at each time step

combining the original pressure and the curl-free part of the decomposition.
Optimal order rates of the convergence are proved for both velocity and

crucial to measure the errors in appropriate norms. The fully discrete finite

particular, the attenuation and amplification channels are useful to describe

directly associated to the beam splitter and two-mode squeezing operations,
which have operational relevance in quantum protocols with bosonic models. An
important property of these channels is that they are Gaussian completely
positive maps and the action on a general input state depends on the parameters
characterizing the channels. In this work, we study the coherence dynamics
introduced by these channels on input Gaussian states. We derive explicit
expressions for the coherence depending on the parameters describing the
channels. By assuming a displaced thermal state with initial coherence as input
state, for the attenuation case it is observed a revival of the coherence as a
function of the transmissivity coefficient, whereas for the amplification
channel the coherence reaches asymptotic values depending on the gain
coefficient. Further, we obtain the entropy production for these class of

torques (RATs) and MEchanical Torques (METs) and rotational disruption of
grains introduced by Hoang et al. (2019). The disruption of grains happens if
they have attractor points corresponding to high angular momentum (high-J). We
introduce {\it fast disruption} for grains that are directly driven to the
high-J attractor on a timescale of spin-up, and {\it slow disruption} for
grains that are first moved to the low-J attractor and gradually transported to
the high-J attractor by gas collisions. The enhancement of grain magnetic
susceptibility via iron inclusions expands the parameter space for high-J
attractors and increases percentage of grains experiencing the disruption. The
increase in the magnitude of RATs or METs can increase the efficiency of fast
disruption, but counter-intuitively, decreases the effect of slow disruption by
forcing grains towards low-J attractors, whereas the increase in gas density
accelerates disruption by faster transporting grains to the high-J attractor.
We also show that disruption induced by RATs and METs depends on the angle
between the magnetic field and the anisotropic flow. We find that pinwheel
torques can increase the efficiency of {\it fast disruption} but may decrease
the efficiency of {\it slow disruption} by delaying the transport of grains
from the low-J to high-J attractors via gas collisions. The selective nature of
the rotational disruption opens a possibility of observational testing of grain
composition as well as physical processes of grain alignment.

to avoid the problem of words skipping and repeating in Tacotron. As we all
know, model size is a key factor for on-device TTS. For DeviceTTS, Deep
Feedforward Sequential Memory Network (DFSMN) is used as the basic component.
Moreover, to speed up inference, mix-resolution decoder is proposed for balance
the inference speed and speech quality. Experiences are done with WORLD and
LPCNet vocoder. Finally, with only 1.4 million model parameters and 0.099
GFLOPS, DeviceTTS achieves comparable performance with Tacotron and FastSpeech.
As far as we know, the DeviceTTS can meet the needs of most of the devices in
practical application.

social interaction that centers on two protagonists, systems make inferences
about the underlying relationship trajectory. Specifically, we propose two
evaluation tasks: Relationship Outlook Prediction MCQ and Resolution Prediction
MCQ. In Relationship Outlook Prediction, a system maps an interaction to a
relationship outlook that captures how the interaction is expected to change
the relationship. In Resolution Prediction, a system attributes a given
relationship outlook to a particular resolution that explains the outcome.
These two tasks parallel two real-life questions that people frequently ponder
upon as they navigate different social situations: ""where is this relationship
going?"" and ""how did we end up here?"". To facilitate the investigation of human
social relationships through these two tasks, we construct a new dataset,
Social Narrative Tree, which consists of 1250 stories documenting a variety of
daily social interactions. The narratives encode a multitude of social elements
that interweave to give rise to rich commonsense knowledge of how relationships
evolve with respect to social interactions. We establish baseline performances
using language models and the accuracies are significantly lower than human
performance. The results demonstrate that models need to look beyond syntactic
and semantic signals to comprehend complex human relationships.

control of these underactuated balance robots aims to achieve both external
(actuated) subsystem trajectory tracking and internal (unactuated) subsystem
balancing tasks with limited actuation authority. This paper proposes a
learning model-based control framework for underactuated balance robots. The
key idea to simultaneously achieve tracking and balancing tasks is to design
control strategies in slow- and fast-time scales, respectively. In slow-time
scale, model predictive control (MPC) is used to generate the desired internal
subsystem trajectory that encodes the external subsystem tracking performance
and control input. In fast-time scale, the actual internal trajectory is
stabilized to the desired internal trajectory by using an inverse dynamics
controller. The coupling effects between the external and internal subsystems
are captured through the planned internal trajectory profile and the dual
structural properties of the robotic systems. The control design is based on
Gaussian processes (GPs) regression model that are learned from experiments
without need of priori knowledge about the robot dynamics nor successful
balance demonstration. The GPs provide estimates of modeling uncertainties of
the robotic systems and these uncertainty estimations are incorporated in the
MPC design to enhance the control robustness to modeling errors. The
learning-based control design is analyzed with guaranteed stability and
performance. The proposed design is demonstrated by experiments on a Furuta
pendulum and an autonomous bikebot.

simple property of neural network design has resulted in highly effective
architectures for a variety of tasks. Nevertheless, there is limited
understanding of effects of depth and width on the learned representations. In
this paper, we study this fundamental question. We begin by investigating how
varying depth and width affects model hidden representations, finding a
characteristic block structure in the hidden representations of larger capacity
(wider or deeper) models. We demonstrate that this block structure arises when
model capacity is large relative to the size of the training set, and is
indicative of the underlying layers preserving and propagating the dominant
principal component of their representations. This discovery has important
ramifications for features learned by different models, namely, representations
outside the block structure are often similar across architectures with varying
widths and depths, but the block structure is unique to each model. We analyze
the output predictions of different model architectures, finding that even when
the overall accuracy is similar, wide and deep models exhibit distinctive error
patterns and variations across classes.

the local field potential, which is known to be involved in functions such as
cognition and attention. In this study, the modified theta model is considered
to investigate the theoretical relationship between the microscopic structure
of inhibitory neurons and their gamma oscillations under a wide class of
distribution functions of tonic currents on individual neurons. The stability
and bifurcation of gamma oscillations for the Vlasov equation of the model is
investigated by the generalized spectral theory. It is shown that as a
connection probability of neurons increases, a pair of generalized eigenvalues
crosses the imaginary axis twice, which implies that a stable gamma oscillation
exists only when the connection probability has a value within a suitable
range. On the other hand, when the distribution of tonic currents on individual
neurons is the Lorentzian distribution, the Vlasov equation is reduced to a
finite dimensional dynamical system. The bifurcation analyses of the reduced
equation exhibit equivalent results with the generalized spectral theory. It is
also demonstrated that the numerical computations of neuronal population follow
the analyses of the generalized spectral theory as well as the bifurcation
analysis of the reduced equation.

Topological Quantum Order, the bulk gap is stable under perturbations that
decay at long distances faster than a stretched exponential. Compared to
previous work we expand the class of frustration-free quantum spin models that
can be handled to include models with more general boundary conditions, and
models with discrete symmetry breaking. Detailed estimates allow us to
formulate sufficient conditions for the validity of positive lower bounds for
the gap that are uniform in the system size and that are explicit to some
degree. We provide a survey of the BHM strategy following the approach of
Michalakis and Zwolak, with alterations introduced to accommodate more general
than just periodic boundary conditions and more general lattices. We express
the fundamental condition known as LTQO by means of the notion of
indistinguishability radius, which we introduce. Using the uniform
finite-volume results we then proceed to study the thermodynamic limit. We
first study the case of a unique limiting ground state and then also consider
models with spontaneous breaking of a discrete symmetry. In the latter case,
LTQO cannot hold for all local observables. However, for perturbations that
preserve the symmetry, we show stability of the gap and the structure of the
broken symmetry phases. We prove that the GNS Hamiltonian associated with each

traditional radio frequency (RF) Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN)
technologies. This is essentially due to HBC providing a broadband
communication channel with enhanced signal security in the physical layer due
to lower radiation from the human body as compared to its RF counterparts. An
in-depth understanding of the mechanism for the channel loss variability and
associated biophysical model needs to be developed before EQS-HBC can be used
more frequently in WBAN consumer and medical applications. Biophysical models
characterizing the human body as a communication channel didn't exist in
literature for a long time. Recent developments have shown models that capture
the channel response for fixed transmitter and receiver positions on the human
body. These biophysical models do not capture the variability in the HBC
channel for varying positions of the devices with respect to the human body. In
this study, we provide a detailed analysis of the change in path loss in a
capacitive-HBC channel in the electroquasistatic (EQS) domain. Causes of
channel loss variability namely: inter-device coupling and effects of fringe
fields due to body's shadowing effects are investigated. FEM based simulation
results are used to analyze the channel response of human body for different
positions and sizes of the device which are further verified using measurement
results to validate the developed biophysical model. Using the bio-physical
model, we develop a closed form equation for the path loss in a capacitive HBC
channel which is then analyzed as a function of the geometric properties of the
device and the position with respect to the human body which will help pave the
path towards future EQSHBC WBAN design.

van der Waals layered magnets is critical in realizing their potential
next-generation applications. In this study, we employ high frequency (240 GHz)
electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy on plate-like CrBr$_{3}$ to gain
insight into the magnetic interactions as a function of temperature (200 - 4 K)
and the angle of rotation ${\theta}$. We find that the temperature dependence
of the ESR linewidth is well described by the Ginzberg-Landau critical model as
well as Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition model, indicative of
the presence of two-dimensional (2D) correlations. This suggests that the
three-dimensional ferromagnet CrBr$_{3}$, which has been described as an Ising
or Heisenberg ferromagnet, could present 2D magnetic correlations and BKT-like
behavior even in its bulk form; an observation that, to the best of our
knowledge, has not been reported in the literature. Furthermore, our findings
show that the resonance field follows a $(3cos^2{\theta} - 1)$-like angular
dependence, while the linewidth follows a $(3cos^2{\theta} - 1)^2$-like angular
dependence. This observed angular dependence of the resonance field and
linewidth further confirm an unanticipated 2D magnetic behavior in CrBr$_{3}$.
This behavior is likely due to the interaction of the external magnetic field
applied during the ESR experiment that allows for the mediation of long-range
vortex-like correlations between the spin clusters that may have formed due to
magnetic phase separation. This study demonstrates the significance of
employing spin sensitive techniques such as ESR to better understand the
magnetic correlations in similar van der Waals magnets.

While artificial qualitative analysis of meibography images could lead to low
repeatability and efficiency and multi-parametric analysis is demanding to
offer more comprehensive information in discovering subtle changes of meibomian
glands during MGD progression, we developed an automated and multi-parametric
algorithm for objective and quantitative analysis of meibography images. The
full architecture of the algorithm can be divided into three steps: (1)
segmentation of the tarsal conjunctiva area as the region of interest (ROI);
(2) segmentation and identification of glands within the ROI; and (3)
quantitative multi-parametric analysis including newly defined gland diameter
deformation index (DI), gland tortuosity index (TI), and glands signal index
(SI). To evaluate the performance of the automated algorithm, the similarity
index (k) and the segmentation error including the false positive rate (r_P)
and the false negative rate (r_N) are calculated between the manually defined
ground truth and the automatic segmentations of both the ROI and meibomian
glands of 15 typical meibography images. The feasibility of the algorithm is
demonstrated in analyzing typical meibograhy images.

Lagrange multipliers on the subdomain interfaces to impose weakly continuity of
normal stress and normal velocity, respectively. The global problem is reduced
to an interface problem for the Lagrange multipliers, which is solved by a
Krylov space iterative method. We study both monolithic and split methods. In
the monolithic method, a coupled displacement-pressure interface problem is
solved, with each iteration requiring the solution of local Biot problems. We
show that the resulting interface operator is positive definite and analyze the
convergence of the iteration. We further study drained split and fixed stress
Biot splittings, in which case we solve separate interface problems requiring
elasticity and Darcy solves. We analyze the stability of the split
formulations. Numerical experiments are presented to illustrate the convergence
of the domain decomposition methods and compare their accuracy and efficiency.

enhance the network secure transmission performance by reconfiguring the
wireless propagation environment. However, due to the passive nature of
eavesdroppers and the cascaded channel brought by the RIS, the eavesdroppers'
channel state information is imperfectly obtained at the base station. Under
the channel uncertainty, the optimal phase-shift, power allocation, and
transmission rate design for secure transmission is currently unknown due to
the difficulty of handling the probabilistic constraint with coupled variables.
To fill this gap, this paper formulates a problem of energy-efficient secure
transmission design while incorporating the probabilistic constraint. By
transforming the probabilistic constraint and decoupling the variables, the
secure energy efficiency maximization problem can be solved via alternatively
executing concave-convex procedure and semidefinite relaxation technique. To
scale the solution to massive antennas and reflecting elements scenario, an
accelerated first-order algorithm with low complexity is further
proposed.Simulation results show that the proposed accelerated first-order
algorithm achieves identical performance to the conventional method but saves
at least two orders of magnitude in computation time. Moreover, the resultant
RIS aided secure transmission significantly improves the energy efficiency
compared to baseline schemes of random phase-shift, fixed phase-shift, and RIS
ignoring CSI uncertainty.

critical temperature Tc and distinct electronic structures in iron-based

really reach due to the inconsistency of the results obtained from the
transport, magnetic and spectroscopic measurements. Here we report
spectroscopic evidence of superconductivity pairing at 83 K in single-layer
FeSe/STO films. By preparing high-quality single-layer FeSe/STO films, we
observe for the first time strong superconductivity-induced Bogoliubov
back-bending bands that extend to rather high binding energy ~100 meV by
high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements. The Bogoliubov
back-bending band provides a new definitive benchmark of superconductivity
pairing that is directly observed up to 83 K in the single-layer FeSe/STO
films. Moreover, we find that the superconductivity pairing state can be
further divided into two temperature regions of 64-83 K and below 64 K. We
propose the 64-83 K region may be attributed to superconductivity fluctuation
while the region below 64 K corresponds to the realization of long-range
superconducting phase coherence. These results indicate that either Tc as high
as 83 K is achievable in iron-based superconductors, or there is a pseudogap
formation from superconductivity fluctuation in single-layer FeSe/STO films.

suggestions to users, which is opposed to suggesting popular items. However,
the normal training paradigm, i.e., fitting a recommender model to recover the
user behavior data with pointwise or pairwise loss, makes the model biased
towards popular items. This results in the terrible Matthew effect, making
popular items be more frequently recommended and become even more popular.
Existing work addresses this issue with Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW),
which decreases the impact of popular items on the training and increases the
impact of long-tail items. Although theoretically sound, IPW methods are highly
sensitive to the weighting strategy, which is notoriously difficult to tune. In
this work, we explore the popularity bias issue from a novel and fundamental
perspective -- cause-effect. We identify that popularity bias lies in the
direct effect from the item node to the ranking score, such that an item's
intrinsic property is the cause of mistakenly assigning it a higher ranking
score. To eliminate popularity bias, it is essential to answer the
counterfactual question that what the ranking score would be if the model only
uses item property. To this end, we formulate a causal graph to describe the
important cause-effect relations in the recommendation process. During
training, we perform multi-task learning to achieve the contribution of each
cause; during testing, we perform counterfactual inference to remove the effect
of item popularity. Remarkably, our solution amends the learning process of
recommendation which is agnostic to a wide range of models -- it can be easily
implemented in existing methods. We demonstrate it on Matrix Factorization (MF)
and LightGCN [20]. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

an unsolved problem due to the unpredictable motions of moving obstacles and
the curse of dimensionality from the state-time space. Existing state-time
planners are typically implemented based on randomized sampling approaches or
path searching on discretized state graph. The smoothness, path clearance, and
planning efficiency of these planners are usually not satisfying. In this work,
we propose a gradient-based planner over the state-time space for online
trajectory generation in highly dynamic environments. To enable the
gradient-based optimization, we propose a Timed-ESDT that supports distance and
gradient queries with state-time keys. Based on the Timed-ESDT, we also define
a smooth prior and an obstacle likelihood function that is compatible with the
state-time space. The trajectory planning is then formulated to a MAP problem
and solved by an efficient numerical optimizer. Moreover, to improve the
optimality of the planner, we also define a state-time graph and then conduct
path searching on it to find a better initialization for the optimizer. By
integrating the graph searching, the planning quality is significantly
improved. Experiment results on simulated and benchmark datasets show that our
planner can outperform the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its
significant advantages over the traditional ones.

conditional nonparametric multilevel latent class analysis (NP-MLCA) for
multi-site program evaluation using an empirical dataset. Second, to
investigate how classification accuracy and parameter estimation of a
conditional NP-MLCA are affected by six study factors: the quality of latent
class indicators, the number of latent class indicators, level-1 covariate
effects, cross-level covariate effects, the number of level-2 units, and the
size of level-2 units. A total of 96 conditions was examined using a simulation
study. The resulting classification accuracy rates, the power and type-I error
of cross-level covariate effects and contextual effects suggest that the
nonparametric multilevel latent class model can be applied broadly in
multilevel contexts.

the geometric theory of the Ricci flow on Riemannian manifolds. First we use
BRST quantization to construct a ""primitive"" topological Lifshitz-type theory
for only the spatial metric, with spatial diffeomorphism invariance and no
gauge symmetry, associated with Hamilton's Ricci flow: Hamilton's flow equation
appears as the localization equation of the primitive theory. Then we extend
the primitive theory by gauging foliation-preserving spacetime symmetries.
Crucially, all our theories are required to exhibit an ${\cal N}=2$ extended
BRST symmetry. First, we gauge spatial diffeomorphisms, and show that this
gives us access to the mathematical technique known as the DeTurck trick.
Finally, we gauge foliation-preserving time reparametrizations, both with the
projectable and nonprojectable lapse function. The path integral of the full
theory is localized to the solutions of Ricci-type flow equations, generalizing
those of Perelman. The role of Perelman's dilaton is played by the
nonprojectable lapse function. Perelman's ${\cal F}$-functional appears as the
superpotential of our theory. Since there is no spin-statistics theorem in
nonrelativistic quantum field theory, the two supercharges of our gravity
theory do not have to be interpreted as BRST charges and, after the
continuation to real time, the theory can be studied as a candidate for
nonrelativistic quantum gravity with propagating bosonic and fermionic degrees
of freedom.

tactic of discretionary lane-change initiation for fully autonomous vehicles
through human-computer interactions. Instead of learning from human-driving
demonstrations, a reinforcement learning technique is employed to learn how to
initiate lane changes from traffic context, the action of a self-driving
vehicle, and in-vehicle user feedback. The proposed offline algorithm rewards
the action-selection strategy when the user gives positive feedback and
penalizes it when negative feedback. Also, a multi-dimensional driving scenario
is considered to represent a more realistic lane-change trade-off. The results
show that the lane-change initiation model obtained by this method can
reproduce the personal lane-change tactic, and the performance of the
customized models (average accuracy 86.1%) is much better than that of the
non-customized models (average accuracy 75.7%). This method allows continuous
improvement of customization for users during fully autonomous driving even
without human-driving experience, which will significantly enhance the user
acceptance of high-level autonomy of self-driving vehicles.

areas of wireless communications. In recent years, deep learning (DL) based
approaches have attracted interests of researchers to solve the sparse linear
inverse problem by unfolding iterative algorithms as neural networks.
Typically, research concerning DL assume a fixed number of network layers.
However, it ignores a key character in traditional iterative algorithms, where
the number of iterations required for convergence changes with varying sparsity
levels. By investigating on the projected gradient descent, we unveil the
drawbacks of the existing DL methods with fixed depth. Then we propose an
end-to-end trainable DL architecture, which involves an extra halting score at
each layer. Therefore, the proposed method learns how many layers to execute to
emit an output, and the network depth is dynamically adjusted for each task in
the inference phase. We conduct experiments using both synthetic data and
applications including random access in massive MTC and massive MIMO channel
estimation, and the results demonstrate the improved efficiency for the

we apply a recently proposed supervised sequential pattern mining algorithm
called safe pattern pruning (SPP) to 490 labelled event sequences representing
passages of play from one rugby team's matches from the 2018 Japan Top League.
We compare the SPP-obtained patterns that are the most discriminative between
scoring and non-scoring outcomes from both the team's and opposition teams'
perspectives, with the most frequent patterns obtained with well-known
unsupervised sequential pattern mining algorithms when applied to subsets of
the original dataset, split on the label. Our obtained results found that
linebreaks, successful lineouts, regained kicks in play, repeated
phase-breakdown play, and failed exit plays by the opposition team were
identified as as the patterns that discriminated most between the team scoring
and not scoring. Opposition team linebreaks, errors made by the team,
opposition team lineouts, and repeated phase-breakdown play by the opposition
team were identified as the patterns that discriminated most between the
opposition team scoring and not scoring. It was also found that, by virtue of
its supervised nature as well as its pruning and safe-screening properties, SPP
obtained a greater variety of generally more sophisticated patterns than the
unsupervised models, which are likely to be of more utility to coaches and
performance analysts.

this method is quite compatible with the experimental data. The SnO$_2$ has an
important usage area in optoelectronic devices due to its transparent and
conductive nature. One of these important areas is the use of SnO$_2$ as an
electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cells. Therefore, the energy
level of the conduction band of the SnO$_2$ is important. In the Pb doped
SnO$_2$ cases, the band gap narrows as the Pb doping rate increases. The
bandgap of SnO$_2$ can be narrowed from 3.60 eV to 3.02 eV with a %12.5 Pb
doping ratio, and this narrowing is proportional to the amount of Pb. The
calculation results obtained in this study show that the decrease in the energy
level of the bottom of the conduction band plays an important role in the
narrowing of the band gap and there is no significant change in the energy
level of the top of the valence band. Due to this effect of the Pb atom, the
energy level of the conduction band can be adjusted by using the doping ratio
of the Pb atom and the band gap can be narrowed in a controlled manner. With
the Pb doping, the energy levels of the SnO$_2$ ETL can be adjusted in a range
according to the type of perovskite used in solar cell. In addition, the doping
with Pb does not create electron traps in the band gap, which is important in
the transport process of electrons.

is expected, i.e., denser (lighter) fluid moves outward (inward) from (toward)

the existence of an unexpected outward motion of warm and lighter vortices in
rotating turbulent convection. This anomalous vortex motion occurs under rapid
rotations when the centrifugal buoyancy is sufficiently strong to induce a
symmetry-breaking in the vorticity field, i.e., the vorticity of the cold
anticyclones overrides that of the warm cyclones. We show that through
hydrodynamic interactions the densely populated vortices can self-aggregate
into coherent clusters and exhibit collective motion in this flow regime.
Interestingly, the correlation of the vortex velocity fluctuations within a
cluster is scale-free, with the correlation length being about 30% of the
cluster length. Such long-range correlation leads to the collective outward
motion of cyclones. Our study provides new understanding of vortex dynamics

incorporating the effects of habitat complexity on the carrying capacity and
fear effect of prey and predator functional response. We establish conditions
for the existence and stability of all feasible equilibrium points of the
non-spatial model and later we prove the existence of Hopf and transcritical
bifurcations in different parametric phase-planes analytically and numerically.
The stability of the spatial system is studied and we discuss the conditions
for Turing instability. Selecting suitable control parameter from the Turing
space, the existence conditions for stable patterns are derived using the
amplitude equations. Results obtained from theoretical analysis of the
amplitude equations are justified by numerical simulation results near the
critical parameter value. Further, from numerical simulation, we illustrate the
effect of diffusion of the dynamical system in the spatial domain by different

habitat complexity which helps the prey to survive in the spatio-temporal

draw to provision resources. This leaves resources underutilized and requires
more datacenters to be built. Prior work has used power capping to shave the
rare power peaks and add more servers to the datacenter, thereby
oversubscribing its resources and lowering capital costs. This works well when
the workloads and their server placements are known. Unfortunately, these
factors are unknown in public clouds, forcing providers to limit the
oversubscription so that performance is never impacted.
  In this paper, we argue that providers can use predictions of workload
performance criticality and virtual machine (VM) resource utilization to
increase oversubscription. This poses many challenges, such as identifying the
performance-critical workloads from black-box VMs, creating support for
criticality-aware power management, and increasing oversubscription while
limiting the impact of capping. We address these challenges for the hardware
and software infrastructures of Microsoft Azure. The results show that we
enable a 2x increase in oversubscription with minimum impact to critical

technology that satisfies high Doppler requirements for future mobile systems.
OTFS modulation encodes information symbols and pilot symbols into the

from inter-Doppler interference (IDI) in the fading channels with fractional
Doppler shifts that are sampled at noninteger indices in the DD domain. IDI has
been treated as an unavoidable effect because the fractional Doppler shifts
cannot be obtained directly from the received pilot symbols. In this paper, we
provide a solution to channel estimation for fractional Doppler channels. The
proposed estimation provides new insight into the OTFS input-output relation in
the DD domain as a 2D circular convolution with a small approximation.
According to the input-output relation, we also provide a low-complexity
channel equalization method using the estimated channel information. We
demonstrate the error performance of the proposed channel estimation and
equalization in several channels by simulations. The simulation results show
that in high-mobility environments, the total system utilizing the proposed

parameterizing them onto some simple planar domains with a fixed boundary shape

may lead to some undesirable distortion in the parameterization. It is
therefore more natural to consider free-boundary conformal parameterizations of
point clouds, which minimize the local geometric distortion of the mapping

technology, and economics. Dynamical field inference (DFI) addresses the
problem of reconstructing a stochastically driven, dynamically evolving field
from finite data. It relies on information field theory (IFT), the information
theory for fields. Here, the relations of DFI, IFT, and the recently developed
supersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS) are established in a pedagogical
discussion. In IFT, field expectation values can be calculated from the
partition function of the full space-time inference problem. The partition
function of the inference problem invokes a functional Dirac function to
guarantee the dynamics, as well as a field-dependent functional determinant, to
establish proper normalization, both impeding the necessary evaluation of the
path integral over all field configurations. STS replaces these problematic
expressions via the introduction of fermionic ghost and bosonic Lagrange
fields, respectively. The action of these fields has a supersymmetry, which
means there exists an exchange operation between bosons and fermions that
leaves the system invariant. In contrast to this, measurements of the dynamical
fields do not adhere to this supersymmetry. The supersymmetry can also be
broken spontaneously, in which case the system evolves chaotically. This
affects the predictability of the system and thereby make DFI more challenging.
We investigate the interplay of measurement constraints with the non-linear
chaotic dynamics of a simplified, illustrative system with the help of Feynman
diagrams and show that the Fermionic corrections are essential to obtain the
correct posterior statistics over system trajectories.

our approach the case of piecewise rational functions, which makes it possible
to address a wide class of nonconvex exact and continuous relaxations of the

disadvantages. Data transmitted from a camera are buffered multiple times and

important during the processing of data streams from several imaging devices,

computing such nodes has received a lot of attention. When considering the
generalization of computing central groups of nodes, challenging optimization
problems occur. In this work, we study two such problems, group-harmonic
maximization and group-closeness maximization both from a theoretical and from
an algorithm engineering perspective.
  On the theoretical side, we obtain the following results. For group-harmonic
maximization, unless $P=NP$, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that
achieves an approximation factor better than $1-1/e$ (directed) and $1-1/(4e)$
(undirected), even for unweighted graphs. On the positive side, we show that a
greedy algorithm achieves an approximation factor of $\lambda(1-2/e)$
(directed) and $\lambda(1-1/e)/2$ (undirected), where $\lambda$ is the ratio of
minimal and maximal edge weights. For group-closeness maximization, the
undirected case is $NP$-hard to be approximated to within a factor better than
$1-1/(e+1)$ and a constant approximation factor is achieved by a local-search
algorithm. For the directed case, however, we show that, for any
$\epsilon<1/2$, the problem is $NP$-hard to be approximated within a factor of
$4|V|^{-\epsilon}$.
  From the algorithm engineering perspective, we provide efficient
implementations of the above greedy and local search algorithms. In our
experimental study we show that, on small instances where an optimum solution
can be computed in reasonable time, the quality of both the greedy and the
local search algorithms come very close to the optimum. On larger instances,
our local search algorithms yield results with superior quality compared to
existing greedy and local search solutions, at the cost of additional running

state-of-the-art approaches are unable to hand over novel objects to receivers

existing fusion methods assume that the LM is integrated with recurrent neural
network-based seq2seq models instead of the Transformer. Therefore, this paper
proposes a fusion method that can explicitly utilize network structures in the
Transformer. The proposed method, called {\bf memory attentive fusion},
leverages the Transformer-style attention mechanism that repeats source-target

testing (COST). The BEST policy is a suppression strategy that provides a
minimum testing rate that stops the growth of the epidemic when implemented.
The COST policy, on the other hand, is a mitigation strategy that provides an
optimal value of testing rate minimizing the peak value of the infected
population when the total stockpile of tests is limited. Both testing policies
are evaluated by their impact on the number of active intensive care unit (ICU)

learning based reconstruction approach that results in orders of magnitude
improvement in image quality for lensless reconstructions. Our approach, called
$\textit{FlatNet}$, lays down a framework for reconstructing high-quality
photorealistic images from mask-based lensless cameras, where the camera's

inversion stage that maps the measurement into a space of intermediate
reconstruction by learning parameters within the forward model formulation, and
(2) a perceptual enhancement stage that improves the perceptual quality of this
intermediate reconstruction. These stages are trained together in an end-to-end
manner. We show high-quality reconstructions by performing extensive
experiments on real and challenging scenes using two different types of
lensless prototypes: one which uses a separable forward model and another,
which uses a more general non-separable cropped-convolution model. Our
end-to-end approach is fast, produces photorealistic reconstructions, and is
easy to adopt for other mask-based lensless cameras.

stepped fan/deltas, we find hydrated silica occurs within the bulk fan deposits
and form sedimentary layers correlated with elevation, corroborating the
formation of hydrated silica through precipitation. Meanwhile in the older
fan/deltas silica mostly occur at distal locations and the relation to primary
sedimentary deposits is more complex. We propose that the hydrated
silica-bearing deposits in stepped fan/deltas likely formed authigenically from
martian surface waters, mainly during the Late Hesperian and Early Amazonian

time structures. In this thesis, we investigate aspects of a generalisation of
statistical equilibrium, specifically Gibbs states, suitable for background
independent systems. We emphasise on an information theoretic characterisation
based on the maximum entropy principle. Subsequently, we explore the resultant
generalised Gibbs states in a discrete quantum gravitational system composed of
many candidate quanta of geometry, utilising their field theoretic formulation
of group field theory and various many-body techniques. We construct several
concrete examples of quantum gravitational generalised Gibbs states. We further
develop inequivalent thermal representations based on entangled, two-mode
squeezed, thermofield double vacua, induced by a class of generalised Gibbs
states. In these representations, we define a class of thermal condensates
which encode statistical fluctuations in a given observable, e.g. volume of the
quantum geometry. We apply these states in the condensate cosmology programme
of group field theory to study a relational effective cosmological dynamics
extracted from a class of free models, for homogeneous and isotropic
spacetimes. We find the correct classical limit of Friedmann equations at late
times, with a bounce and accelerated expansion at early times.

identify communities or clusters that are crucial in the analysis of graph
data. To do so, we learn a clustered representative graph by solving an
optimization problem that involves a data fidelity term to the observed layers,
and a regularization pushing for a sparse and community-aware graph. We use the
contrastive loss as a data fidelity term, in order to properly aggregate the
observed layers into a representative graph. The regularization is based on a
measure of graph sparsification called ""effective resistance"", coupled with a
penalization of the first few eigenvalues of the representative graph Laplacian
matrix to favor the formation of communities. The proposed optimization problem
is nonconvex but fully differentiable, and thus can be solved via the projected
gradient method. Experiments show that our method leads to a significant
improvement w.r.t. state-of-the-art multilayer graph learning algorithms for

AGN timescales, such that a higher fraction of luminous obscured quasars are
seen due to the short timescale for which quasars are most luminous. Adopting
quasar evolutionary scenarios, extended ($\sim10^{2-3}$pc) obscuration may work

the hideout of the ""missing baryons"". The leading theory of galaxy formation
predicts that a huge amount of baryons resides around galaxies extending out to
their virial radii in the form of diffuse and hot gas of $10^6-10^7\,$K, which
is also known as the major component of the circumgalactic medium (CGM).
Studies by various groups via different techniques, however, have not reached a
consensus on the role of CGM in accounting for the missing baryons, with the
estimated contribution ranging from a minor fraction to enclosing the baryon
budget of the galaxy. In this work we attempt to measure the mass of missing
baryons in CGM with a novel method based on the gamma-ray observations of the
extended halo of the Andromeda Galaxy. Since cosmic-ray particles that are
generated inside the galaxy will eventually escape to the CGM, they will
produce gamma-ray emission via the proton-proton collision with CGM. Different
from some traditional measurements which are sensitive only to gas in certain
specific temperature range, the hadronic gamma-ray flux is sensitive to
baryonic gases in all phases and does not rely on the metallicity in the halo.
Our result suggests that the total baryon mass contained within the virial
radius is less than $(1.4-5)\times 10^{10}M_\odot$ according to the gamma-ray
intensity obtained with a model-dependent analysis. It implies that the CGM of
Andromeda Galaxy may not account for more than $30\%$ of the missing baryons,
but the result is subject to uncertainties from the gamma-ray intensity upper
limit, diffusion coefficient of the CRs in the halo as well as the stellar mass
and dark matter halo mass of the galaxy. This method will become more
constraining provided better understandings on these issues and more sensitive
gamma-ray telescopes in the future.

This observation cannot be explained by means of the statistical-decay model.
The ideal classical gas model at $kT$ = 0.4 MeV reproduces fairly well the
experimental momentum distribution and the observed multiplicity of $\alpha$
particles corresponds to an excitation energy around 96 MeV. The method of
distributed $m\alpha$-decay ensembles is in agreement with the experimental
results if we assume that the $\alpha$-gas state in $^{56}$Ni exists at around

unbounded domains which can be split into a bounded interior domain of primary
interest and an exterior domain with separable geometry. To compute the
solution in the interior domain, approximations to the Dirichlet-to-Neumann
(DtN) map of the exterior domain have to be imposed as transparent boundary
conditions on the artificial coupling boundary. Although the DtN map can be
computed by separation of variables, it is a nonlocal operator with dense
matrix representations, and hence computationally inefficient. Therefore,
approximations of DtN maps by sparse matrices, usually involving additional
degrees of freedom, have been studied intensively in the literature using a
variety of approaches including different types of infinite elements, local
non-reflecting boundary conditions, and perfectly matched layers. The entries
of these sparse matrices are derived analytically, e.g. from transformations or
asymptotic expansions of solutions to the differential equation in the exterior
domain. In contrast, in this paper we propose to `learn' the matrix entries
from the DtN map in its separated form by solving an optimization problem as a
preprocessing step. Theoretical considerations suggest that the approximation
quality of learned infinite elements improves exponentially with increasing
number of infinite element degrees of freedom, which is confirmed in numerical
experiments. These numerical studies also show that learned infinite elements
outperform state-of-the-art methods for the Helmholtz equation. At the same
time, learned infinite elements are much more flexible than traditional methods
as they, e.g., work similarly well for exterior domains involving strong
reflections, for example, for the atmosphere of the Sun, which is strongly
inhomogeneous and exhibits reflections at the corona.

B: a moderately disruptive trade agreement (better than WTO); C: a minimally

minimally disruptive trade agreement +9.3% [+0.8%, +21.9%]. The number of
households experiencing food insecurity and its severity are likely to increase
because of expected sizeable increases in median food prices in the months
after Brexit, whereas low income group spending on food is unlikely to
increase, and may be further eroded by other factors not considered here (e.g.
COVID-19). Higher increases are more likely than lower rises and towards the
upper limits, these would entail severe impacts. Research showing a low food
budget leads to increasingly poor diet suggests that demand for health services
in both the short and longer term is likely to increase due to the effects of
food insecurity on the incidence and management of diet-sensitive conditions.

is still much lower than our design. However, the background level is already
high due to the initial vacuum condition and other accelerator parameters, and
it is the most limiting factor of the accelerator and detector operation. Hence
the occupancy and radiation effects to the frontend electronics are rather
severe, and they cause various kind of instabilities. We present the
performance of the system, including the achieved trigger rate, dead-time
fraction, stability, and discuss the experience gained during the operation.

  for robust and accurate classification",,,,,"cs.CV eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning has shown outstanding performance in several applications
including image classification. However, deep classifiers are known to be
highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in that a minor perturbation of the
input can easily lead to an error. Providing robustness to adversarial attacks
is a very challenging task especially in problems involving a large number of
classes, as it typically comes at the expense of an accuracy decrease. In this
work, we propose the Gaussian class-conditional simplex (GCCS) loss: a novel
approach for training deep robust multiclass classifiers that provides
adversarial robustness while at the same time achieving or even surpassing the
classification accuracy of state-of-the-art methods. Differently from other
frameworks, the proposed method learns a mapping of the input classes onto
target distributions in a latent space such that the classes are linearly
separable. Instead of maximizing the likelihood of target labels for individual
samples, our objective function pushes the network to produce feature
distributions yielding high inter-class separation. The mean values of the
distributions are centered on the vertices of a simplex such that each class is
at the same distance from every other class. We show that the regularization of
the latent space based on our approach yields excellent classification accuracy
and inherently provides robustness to multiple adversarial attacks, both
targeted and untargeted, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches over
challenging datasets.

localized within a single potential well -- that is, quantum phase fluctuations

metrology and qubit protection. A direct route is to loosen the inductive
confinement and let the ground state phase spread over multiple Josephson
periods, but this requires a circuit impedance vastly exceeding the resistance
quantum and constitutes an ongoing experimental challenge. Here we take a
complementary approach and fabricate a generalized Josephson element that can
be tuned in situ between one- and two-Cooper-pair tunneling, doubling the
frequency of the corrugation and thereby magnifying the number of wells probed
by the ground state. We measure a tenfold suppression of flux sensitivity of
the first transition energy, implying a twofold increase in the vacuum phase

  Theory and Applications of Categories",,,,"math.CT cs.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In 2017, Bauer, Johnson, Osborne, Riehl, and Tebbe (BJORT) showed that the
Abelian functor calculus provides an example of a Cartesian differential
category. The definition of a Cartesian differential category is based on a
differential combinator which directly formalizes the total derivative from
multivariable calculus. However, in the aforementioned work the authors used
techniques from Goodwillie's functor calculus to establish a linearization
process from which they then derived a differential combinator. This raised the
question of what the precise relationship between linearization and having a
differential combinator might be.
  In this paper, we introduce the notion of a linearizing combinator which
abstracts linearization in the Abelian functor calculus. We then use it to
provide an alternative axiomatization of a Cartesian differential category.
Every Cartesian differential category comes equipped with a canonical
linearizing combinator obtained by differentiation at zero. Conversely, a
differential combinator can be constructed \`a la BJORT when one has a system
of partial linearizing combinators in each context. Thus, while linearizing
combinators do provide an alternative axiomatization of Cartesian differential
categories, an explicit notion of partial linearization is required. This is in
contrast to the situation for differential combinators where partial
differentiation is automatic in the presence of total differentiation. The
ability to form a system of partial linearizing combinators from a total
linearizing combinator, while not being possible in general, is possible when
the setting is Cartesian closed.

combined and coordinated to solve a task. Yet, most ReinforcementLearning (RL)
approaches in robotics study tasks which actually consist only of a single
manipulation skill, such as grasping an object or inserting a pre-grasped
object. As a result the skill ('how' to solve the task) but not the actual goal
of a complete manipulation ('what' to solve) is specified. In contrast, we
study a complex manipulation goal that requires an agent to learn and combine
diverse manipulation skills. We propose a challenging, highly under-actuated
peg-in-hole task with a free, rotational asymmetrical peg, requiring a broad
range of manipulation skills. While correct peg (re-)orientation is a
requirement for successful insertion, there is no reward associated with it.
Hence an agent needs to understand this pre-condition and learn the skill to
fulfil it. The final insertion reward is sparse, allowing freedom in the
solution and leading to complex emerging behaviour not envisioned during the
task design. We tackle the problem in a multi-task RL framework using Scheduled

being made to improve VRU safety from engineering solutions to law enforcement,
the death toll of VRUs' continues to rise. The emerging technology, Cooperative

road users. Such exchanged information is utilized for creating situational
awareness and detecting any potential collisions in advance to take necessary
measures to avoid any possible road casualties. The current state-of-the-art
solutions of C-ITS for VRU safety, however, are limited to unidirectional

substantially limiting the enormous potential of C-ITS which otherwise can be
employed to devise a more effective solution for the VRU safety where VRU can

The algorithm is called the Three Layer Filtering-Harris or TLF-Harris

purpose is 1) to increase the accuracy by deliberately eliminating some
incoming events, i.e., noise, and 2) to improve the real-time performance of
the system, i.e., preserving a constant throughput in terms of input events per
second, by discarding unnecessary events with a limited accuracy loss. An
approximation of the Harris algorithm, in turn, is used to exploit its
high-quality detection capability with a low-complexity implementation to

sub-band model processes each frequency independently. Its input consists of
one frequency and several context frequencies. The output is the prediction of
the clean speech target for the corresponding frequency. These two types of
models have distinct characteristics. The full-band model can capture the
global spectral context and the long-distance cross-band dependencies. However,
it lacks the ability to modeling signal stationarity and attending the local
spectral pattern. The sub-band model is just the opposite. In our proposed
FullSubNet, we connect a pure full-band model and a pure sub-band model
sequentially and use practical joint training to integrate these two types of

full-band and sub-band information are complementary, and the FullSubNet can
effectively integrate them. Besides, the performance of the FullSubNet also

ideal solution for applications that require high-frequency tracking. Moreover,
applications that operate in challenging lighting scenarios can exploit the
high HDR of event cameras, i.e., 140 dB compared to 60 dB of traditional

that uses both events and intensity images captured by a DAVIS camera. The
Harris algorithm is used to extract features, i.e., frame-corners from
keyframes, i.e., intensity images. Afterward, a matching algorithm is used to
extract event-corners from the stream of events. Events are solely used to
perform asynchronous tracking until the next keyframe is captured. Neighboring
events, within a window size of 5x5 pixels around the event-corner, are used to
calculate the velocity and direction of extracted event-corners by fitting the

SLOPE can have various feature selection and clustering properties. On weight

determinantal with explicit time-dependent correlation kernel. Moreover, in the
$q \to 1$ limit, it converges to a continuous Jacobi-like MBP with
Muttalib-Borodin marginals supported on the unit interval. This continuous
process is also determinantal with explicit correlation kernel. We study its
hard-edge scaling limit (around 0) to obtain a discrete-time-dependent
generalization of the classical continuous Bessel kernel of random matrix
theory (and, in fact, of the Meijer $G$-kernel as well). We lastly discuss two
related applications: random sampling from such processes, and their
interpretations as models of directed last passage percolation (LPP). In doing
so, we introduce a corner growth model naturally associated to Jacobi
processes, a version of which is the ""usual"" corner growth of Forrester-Rains
in logarithmic coordinates. The aforementioned hard edge limits for our MBPs
lead to interesting asymptotics for these LPP models. In particular, a special
cases of our LPP asymptotics give rise (via the random matrix Bessel kernel and

interpolating between the Tracy-Widom GUE and the Gumbel distributions.

physical process that dynamically explores chaotic and non-chaotic phases. In a
recent paper Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 042004 (R) (2020), such a phenomenon is
realized in a cavity-QED platform. There, the emergence of chaos and its impact
on STIRAP efficiency are mainly demonstrated in the semiclassical limit. In the
present paper I treat the problem in a fully quantum many-body framework. With
the aim of extracting quantum signatures of a classically chaotic system, it is
shown that an out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC) measure precisely captures
chaotic/non-chaotic features of the system. The prediction by OTOC is in
precise matching with classical chaos quantified by Lyapunov exponent (LE).
Furthermore, it is shown that the quantum route corresponding to the
semiclassical followed state encounters a dip in single-particle purity within
the chaotic phase, depicting a consequence of chaos. A dynamics through the
chaotic phase is associated with spreading of many-body quantum state and an
irreversible increase in the number of participating adiabatic eigenstates.

energies, when the parameters are set in such a way that the cross section at

fluctuations of the onium, which are very deformed with respect to typical
configurations. Using the color dipole picture of high-energy interactions in
quantum chromodynamics, in which the quantum states of the onium are
represented by sets of dipoles generated by a branching process, we describe
the typical scattering configurations as seen from different reference frames,
from the restframe of the nucleus to frames in which the rapidity is shared
between the projectile onium and the nucleus. We show that taking advantage of
the freedom to select a frame in the latter class makes possible to derive
complete asymptotic expressions for some boost-invariant quantities, beyond the
total cross section, from a procedure which leverages the limited available
knowledge on the properties of the solutions to the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation
that governs the rapidity-dependence of total cross sections. We obtain in this
way an analytic expression for the rapidity-distribution of the first branching
of the slowest parent dipole of the set of those which scatter. This
distribution provides an estimator of the correlations of the interacting
dipoles, and is also known to be related to the rapidity-gap distribution in
diffractive dissociation, an observable measurable at a future electron-ion

demonstration of how a Monte Carlo generator can be created from scratch. The
$e^+ e^- \to \mu^+ \mu^- \gamma$ process was chosen, since in this case we are
not faced with either too trivial or too difficult a task. Matrix elements are
calculated using the helicity amplitude method. Monte Carlo algorithm uses the
acceptance-rejection method with an appropriately chosen simplified

detailed pedagogical exposition of both the helicity amplitude method and the
Monte Carlo technique, which we hope will be useful for high energy physics

through a network of narrow channels within the extracellular matrix, before
entering into the blood stream. This strategy is believed to outperform other
migration modes, based on the observation that individual cancer cells can take
advantage of confinement to switch to an adhesion-independent form of
locomotion. Yet, the physical origin of this behaviour has remained elusive and
the mechanisms behind the emergence of coherent flows in populations of
invading cells under confinement are presently unknown. Here we demonstrate
that human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) confined in narrow stripe-shaped regions
undergo collective migration by virtue of a novel type of topological edge
currents, resulting from the interplay between liquid crystalline (nematic)
order, microscopic chirality and topological defects. Thanks to a combination
of in vitro experiments and theory of active hydrodynamics, we show that, while
heterogeneous and chaotic in the bulk of the channel, the spontaneous flow
arising in confined populations of HT1080 cells is rectified along the edges,
leading to long-ranged collective cell migration, with broken chiral symmetry.
These edge currents are fuelled by layers of +1/2 topological defects,
orthogonally anchored at the channel walls and acting as local sources of
chiral active stress. Our work highlights the profound correlation between
confinement and collective migration in multicellular systems and suggests a
possible mechanism for the emergence of directed motion in metastatic cancer.

quasiparticle, so-called Fermi polaron, due to impurity-fermion interaction. We
consider a three-dimensional homogeneous dipolar Fermi gas as a medium, where
the interatomic dipole-dipole interaction (DDI) makes the Fermi surface
deformed into a spheroidal shape, and, using a Chevy-type variational method,
investigate the ground-state properties of the Fermi polaron: the effective
mass, the momentum distribution of a particle-hole (p-h) excitation, the drag
parameter, and the medium density modification around the impurity. These
quantities are shown to exhibit spatial anisotropies in such a way as to
reflect the momentum anisotropy of the background dipolar Fermi gas. We have
also given numerical results for the polaron properties at the unitarity limit
of the impurity-fermion interaction in the case in which the impurity and
fermion masses are equal. It has been found that the transverse effective mass

by $ \sim 10\%$ when the DDI strength is raised from $0$ up to around its
critical value, while the longitudinal ones exhibit a very weak dependence on

(CNNs) have achieved promising results in automatic retinal vessel
segmentation. However, these CNNs remain constrained in capturing retinal
vessels in complex fundus images. To improve their segmentation performance,
these CNNs tend to have many parameters, which may lead to overfitting and high
computational complexity. Moreover, the manual design of competitive CNNs is
time-consuming and requires extensive empirical knowledge. Herein, a novel
automated design method, called Genetic U-Net, is proposed to generate a
U-shaped CNN that can achieve better retinal vessel segmentation but with fewer
architecture-based parameters, thereby addressing the above issues. First, we
devised a condensed but flexible search space based on a U-shaped
encoder-decoder. Then, we used an improved genetic algorithm to identify
better-performing architectures in the search space and investigated the
possibility of finding a superior network architecture with fewer parameters.
The experimental results show that the architecture obtained using the proposed
method offered a superior performance with less than 1% of the number of the
original U-Net parameters in particular and with significantly fewer parameters
than other state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, through in-depth investigation
of the experimental results, several effective operations and patterns of
networks to generate superior retinal vessel segmentations were identified.

turbulence regime of rotating turbulence. We produce a statistically steady
homogeneous turbulent flow that consists of nonlinearly interacting inertial
waves, using rough top and bottom boundaries to prevent the emergence of a
geostrophic flow. As the forcing amplitude increases, the temporal spectrum
evolves from a discrete set of peaks to a continuous spectrum. Maps of the
bicoherence of the velocity field confirm such a gradual transition between
discrete wave interactions at weak forcing amplitude, and the regime described
by weak turbulence theory (WTT) for stronger forcing. In the former regime, the
bicoherence maps display a near-zero background level, together with sharp
localized peaks associated with discrete resonances. By contrast, in the latter
regime the bicoherence is a smooth function that takes values of the order of
the Rossby number, in line with the infinite-domain and random-phase
assumptions of WTT. The spatial spectra then display a power-law behavior, both
the spectral exponent and the spectral level being accurately predicted by WTT
at high Reynolds number and low Rossby number.

strong observability and detectability and strong controllability and
stabilizability. These informativity tests will be in terms of rank tests on

SNe IIP having long plateaus ($\sim100$ days) and the most massive H-rich
envelopes. However, it is an ongoing mystery why SNe II with short plateaus
(tens of days) are rarely seen. Here, we present optical/near-infrared
photometric and spectroscopic observations of luminous Type II short-plateau
SNe 2006Y, 2006ai, and 2016egz. Their plateaus of about $50$-$70$ days and
luminous optical peaks ($\lesssim-18.4$ mag) indicate significant pre-explosion
mass loss resulting in partially stripped H-rich envelopes and early
circumstellar material (CSM) interaction. We compute a large grid of
MESA+STELLA single-star progenitor and light-curve models with various
progenitor zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses, mass-loss efficiencies,
explosion energies, $^{56}$Ni masses, and CSM densities. Our model grid shows a
continuous population of SNe IIP-IIL-IIb-like light-curve morphology in
descending order of H-rich envelope mass. With large $^{56}$Ni masses
($\gtrsim0.05\,M_\odot$), short-plateau SNe II lie in a confined parameter
space as a transitional class between SNe IIL and IIb. For SNe 2006Y, 2006ai,

($M_{\rm ZAMS} \simeq 18$-$22\,M_{\odot}$) with small H-rich envelope masses

mass loss ($\dot{M} \simeq 10^{-2}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$) for the last few
decades before the explosion. If high-mass RSGs result in rare short-plateau
SNe II, then these events might ease some of the apparent underrepresentation
of higher-luminosity RSGs in observed SN II progenitor samples.

Changing the DC pump values and modulation frequencies, we further investigate
the influence of intrinsic noise, considering, in addition, the role of cavity

achieved, at the expense of large pump values, while the often targeted low

enabling large pump rates in nanolasers, whose performance promises to surpass

determined by extrapolating to vanishing pion mass using universal scaling

significantly when learning from noisy labels. To suppressing the impact of
mislabeled data, this paper proposes a conceptually simple yet efficient
training block, termed as Attentive Feature Mixup (AFM), which allows paying
more attention to clean samples and less to mislabeled ones via sample
interactions in small groups. Specifically, this plug-and-play AFM first
leverages a \textit{group-to-attend} module to construct groups and assign
attention weights for group-wise samples, and then uses a \textit{mixup} module
with the attention weights to interpolate massive noisy-suppressed samples. The
AFM has several appealing benefits for noise-robust deep learning. (i) It does
not rely on any assumptions and extra clean subset. (ii) With massive
interpolations, the ratio of useless samples is reduced dramatically compared
to the original noisy ratio. (iii) \pxj{It jointly optimizes the interpolation
weights with classifiers, suppressing the influence of mislabeled data via low
attention weights. (iv) It partially inherits the vicinal risk minimization of
mixup to alleviate over-fitting while improves it by sampling fewer
feature-target vectors around mislabeled data from the mixup vicinal
distribution.} Extensive experiments demonstrate that AFM yields
state-of-the-art results on two challenging real-world noisy datasets: Food101N
and Clothing1M. The code will be available at

morphologies such as gaps, spirals, and warps. Most existing models for
explaining such morphologies focus on the role of massive perturbers (i.e.
planets, stellar companions), ignoring the gravitational effects of the disk
itself. Here we investigate the secular interaction between an eccentric planet
and a massive, external debris disk using a simple analytical model. Our
framework accounts for both the gravitational coupling between the disk and the
planet, as well as the disk self-gravity -- with the limitation that it ignores
the non-axisymmetric component of the disk (self-)gravity. We find generally
that even when the disk is less massive than the planet, the system may feature
secular resonances within the disk (contrary to what may be naively expected),
where planetesimal eccentricities get significantly excited. Given this outcome
we propose that double-ringed debris disks, such as those around HD 107146 and
HD 92945, could be the result of secular resonances with a yet-undetected
planet interior to the disk. We characterize the dependence of the properties
of the secular resonances (i.e. locations, timescales, and widths) on the
planet and disk parameters, finding that the mechanism is robust provided the
disk is massive enough. As an example, we apply our results to HD 107146 and
find that this mechanism readily produces $\sim 20$ au wide non-axisymmetric
gaps. Our results may be used to set constraints on the total mass of
double-ringed debris disks. We demonstrate this for HD 206893, for which we
infer a disk mass of $\approx 170$ Earth masses by considering perturbations
from the known brown dwarf companion.

sampling and reconstruction of sparse signals in shift-invariant (SI) spaces.
We reinterpret the random demodulator, a system that acquires sparse
bandlimited signals, as a system for the acquisition of linear combinations of
the samples in the SI setting with the box function as the sampling kernel. The
sparsity assumption is exploited by the compressive sensing (CS) paradigm for a
recovery of the SI samples from a reduced set of measurements. The SI samples
are subsequently filtered by a discrete-time correction filter to reconstruct
expansion coefficients of the observed signal. Furthermore, we offer a
generalization of the proposed framework to other compactly supported sampling
kernels that span a wider class of SI spaces. The generalized method embeds the
correction filter in the CS optimization problem which directly reconstructs
expansion coefficients of the signal. Both approaches recast an inherently
continuous-domain inverse problem in a set of finite-dimensional CS problems in
an exact way. Finally, we conduct numerical experiments on signals in
polynomial B-spline spaces whose expansion coefficients are assumed to be
sparse in a certain transform domain. The coefficients can be regarded as
parametric models of an underlying continuous-time signal, obtained from a
reduced set of measurements. Such continuous signal representations are
particularly suitable for signal processing without converting them into
samples.

shears the wave, boosting its electric current $j_{\rm A}$. We derive an
analytic expression for the evolution of the wave vector $\boldsymbol{k}$ and
the growth of $j_{\rm A}$. In the strongly sheared regime, $j_{\rm A}$ may
exceed the maximum current $j_{0}$ that can be supported by the background
$e^{\pm}$ plasma. We investigate these ""charge-starved"" waves, first using a
simplified two-fluid analytic model, then with first-principles kinetic
simulations. We find that the Alfv\'en wave continues to propagate successfully
even when $\kappa \equiv j_{\rm A}/j_{0} \gg 1$. It sustains $j_{\rm A}$ by
compressing and advecting the plasma along the magnetic field lines with
particle Lorentz factors $\sim \kappa^{1/2}$. The simulations show how plasma
instabilities lead to gradual dissipation of the wave energy, giving a
dissipation power $L_{\rm diss}\sim 10^{35}(\kappa/100)^{1/2}
(B_w/10^{11}\,{\rm G})\,\mathrm{erg/s}$, where $B_w$ is the wave amplitude. Our

recommender systems, not only to achieve better recommendation performance, but
more importantly to generate explanations of why particular decisions are made.
This can be achieved by explicit KG reasoning, where a model starts from a user
node, sequentially determines the next step, and walks towards an item node of
potential interest to the user. However, this is challenging due to the huge
search space, unknown destination, and sparse signals over the KG, so
informative and effective guidance is needed to achieve a satisfactory
recommendation quality. To this end, we propose a CoArse-to-FinE neural
symbolic reasoning approach (CAFE). It first generates user profiles as coarse
sketches of user behaviors, which subsequently guide a path-finding process to
derive reasoning paths for recommendations as fine-grained predictions. User
profiles can capture prominent user behaviors from the history, and provide
valuable signals about which kinds of path patterns are more likely to lead to
potential items of interest for the user. To better exploit the user profiles,
an improved path-finding algorithm called Profile-guided Path Reasoning (PPR)
is also developed, which leverages an inventory of neural symbolic reasoning
modules to effectively and efficiently find a batch of paths over a large-scale
KG. We extensively experiment on four real-world benchmarks and observe
substantial gains in the recommendation performance compared with

importance to understand their evolution, the diversity of observed

evolution -- the cool supergiant phase -- has received comparatively little
attention. In this study we aim to explore the multiplicity among the cool
supergiants (CSGs) in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (LMC and SMC,
respectively). To do this we compile extensive archival radial velocity (RV)
measurements for over 1000 CSGs from the LMC and SMC, spanning a baseline of
over 40 years. By statistically correcting the RV measurements of each stellar
catalogue to the Gaia DR2 reference frame we are able to effectively compare
these diverse observations. We identify 45 CSGs where RV variations cannot be
explained through intrinsic variability, and are hence considered binary
systems. We obtain a minimum binary fraction of $15\pm4\%$ for the SMC and of
$14\pm5\%$ for the LMC. Combining these results, we determine a minimum binary
fraction of $15\pm3\%$ for CSGs. These results are in good agreement with
previous results which apply a correction to account for observational biases.
These results add strength to the hypothesis that the binary fraction of CSGs
is significantly lower than their main-sequence counterparts. Going forward, we
stress the need for long-baseline multi-epoch spectroscopic surveys to cover
the full parameter space of CSG binary systems.

apply techniques from the manifestly supersymmetric approach to loop quantum

for the treatment of gliomas. However, automatic delineation is challenging due
to the complex appearance and ambiguous outlines of tumors. Considering that
multi-modal MR images can reflect different tumor biological properties, we
develop a novel multi-modal tumor segmentation network (MMTSN) to robustly
segment brain tumors based on multi-modal MR images. The MMTSN is composed of
three sub-branches and a main branch. Specifically, the sub-branches are used
to capture different tumor features from multi-modal images, while in the main
branch, we design a spatial-channel fusion block (SCFB) to effectively
aggregate multi-modal features. Additionally, inspired by the fact that the
spatial relationship between sub-regions of tumor is relatively fixed, e.g.,
the enhancing tumor is always in the tumor core, we propose a spatial loss to
constrain the relationship between different sub-regions of tumor. We evaluate
our method on the test set of multi-modal brain tumor segmentation challenge
2020 (BraTs2020). The method achieves 0.8764, 0.8243 and 0.773 dice score for
whole tumor, tumor core and enhancing tumor, respectively.

The first phase of the experiment is currently under construction at the Paul

second are available. The detector will consist of an ultra-thin pixel tracker
made from High-Voltage Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (HV-MAPS), complemented
by scintillating tiles and fibres for precise timing measurements. The
experiment produces about 100 Gbit/s of zero-suppressed data which are
transported to a filter farm using a network of FPGAs and fast optical links.
On the filter farm, tracks and three-particle vertices are reconstructed using
highly parallel algorithms running on graphics processing units, leading to a
reduction of the data to 100 Mbyte/s for mass storage and offline analysis. The
paper introduces the system design and hardware implementation of the Mu3e data

adversarially injected edges effectively can be viewed as additional samples to

aggregations accumulating over the layers. Conventional GNN aggregation
functions, such as a sum or mean, can be distorted arbitrarily by a single
outlier. We propose a robust aggregation function motivated by the field of
robust statistics. Our approach exhibits the largest possible breakdown point
of 0.5, which means that the bias of the aggregation is bounded as long as the
fraction of adversarial edges of a node is less than 50\%. Our novel
aggregation function, Soft Medoid, is a fully differentiable generalization of
the Medoid and therefore lends itself well for end-to-end deep learning.
Equipping a GNN with our aggregation improves the robustness with respect to

also reflect uncertainties of the seed ASR model. In this paper, we propose a

self-training with WFST-based supervision, which is generated from an N-best

overcome the imbalance of data and enrich the diversity of Raman spectra. From

resulting many-particle ground Floquet wavefunction and quasienergy, as well as
the time-dependent densities and reduced density matrices, are prescribed
explicitly and analyzed at the many-body and mean-field levels of theory for

that the time-dependent densities per particle are given at the limit of an

that the time-dependent reduced one-particle and two-particle density matrices
per particle of the driven mixture are $100\%$ condensed. Interestingly, the
quasienergy per particle {\it does not} coincide with the mean-field value at
this limit, unless the relative center-of-mass coordinate of the two

learning the optimal network parameters via empirical risk minimization and
thereby the optimal network that reconstructs signals from their compressive
linear measurements. In particular, we may learn a sparsity basis that is
shared by all of the iterations/layers and thereby obtain a new approach for
dictionary learning. For this class of networks, we present a generalization
bound, which is based on bounding the Rademacher complexity of hypothesis
classes consisting of such deep networks via Dudley's integral. Remarkably,

  Instead, we introduce $d_p$ convergence, a weaker notion of convergence that
is valid for a class of rectifiable Riemannian spaces. These rectifiable spaces
have well-behaved topology, measure theory, and analysis, though potentially

our $\epsilon$-regularity theorem.

Germany. Since then the local public health offices have been responsible to
monitor and react to the dynamics of the pandemic. One of their major tasks is
to contain the spread of the virus after potential spreading events, for
example when one or multiple participants have a positive test result after a
group meeting (e.g. at school, at a sports event or at work). In this case,
contacts of the infected person have to be traced and potentially are
quarantined (at home) for a period of time. When all relevant contact persons
obtain a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result, the quarantine
may be stopped. However, tracing and testing of all contacts is time-consuming,
costly and (thus) not always feasible. This motivates our work, in which we
present a statistical model for the probability that no transmission of
Sars-CoV-2 occurred given an arbitrary number of test results at potentially
different timepoints. Hereby, the time-dependent sensitivity and specificity of
the conducted PCR test are taken in account. We employ a parametric Bayesian
model which can be adopted to different situations when specific prior

data-driven models can be learned to predict current or future observations.
Oftentimes, anomalous behaviour depends on the internal dynamics of the system
and looks normal in a static context. To address this problem, the model should
also operate depending on state. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks
have been shown to be particularly useful to learn time sequences with varying
length of temporal dependencies and are therefore an interesting general

resilient against server failure under two scenarios related to the geographic
location of primary and secondary servers and resilient against both server and

optimise the number and locations of both primary and secondary processing

server protection without geographical constraints compared to the
non-resilient scenario has resulted in both network and processing energy
penalty as the traffic is doubled. The results also reveal that increasing the
level of resilience to consider geographical constraints compared to case
without geographical constraints resulted in higher network energy penalty when
the demand is low as more nodes are utilised to place the processing servers
under the geographic constraints. Also, increasing the level of resilience to
consider network protection with link and node disjoint selection has resulted
in a low network energy penalty at high demands due to the activation of a
large part of the network in any case due to the demands. However, the results
show that the network energy penalty is reduced with the increasing number of
processing servers at each candidate node. Meanwhile, the same energy for
processing is consumed regardless of the increasing level of resilience as the
same number of processing servers are utilised. A heuristic is developed for
each resilience scenario for real-time implementation where the results show
that the performance of the heuristic is approaching the results of the MILP

nanofibers with diameters corresponding to a single cellulose polymer chain.
The formation of these polymer chains is ruled by repulsive electrostatic
interactions between the oxidized chains. Further first-principles calculations
have been done in order to provide an atomistic understanding the cellulose
disassembling processes, focusing on the balance of the interchain and
intersheet interactions upon oxidation. Firstly we analyse these interaction in
pristine systems, where we found the intersheet interaction stronger than the
interchain one. In the oxidized systems, we have considered the formation of
(charged) carboxylate groups along the inner sites of elementary fibrils. We
show a net charge concentration on the carboxylate groups, supporting the
emergence of repulsive electrostatic interactions between the cellulose
nanofibers. Indeed, our total energy results show that the weakening of the
binding strength between the fibrils is proportional to the concentration and
the net charge density of the carboxylate group. Moreover, by comparing
interchain and intersheet binding energies, we found that most of the
disassembly processes should take place by breaking the interchain
O--H$\cdots$O hydrogen bond interactions, and thus supporting the experimental
observation of single and double cellulose polymeric chains.

information to produce well-focused output during the image reconstruction

defocused imagery. To overcome these issues, an \emph{autofocus} algorithm is
employed as a post-processing step after image reconstruction for the purpose
of improving image quality using the image content itself. These algorithms are
usually iterative and metric-based in that they seek to optimize an image
sharpness metric. In this letter, we demonstrate the potential of machine
learning, specifically deep learning, to address the autofocus problem. We
formulate the problem as a self-supervised, phase error estimation task using a
deep network we call Deep Autofocus. Our formulation has the advantages of
being non-iterative (and thus fast) and not requiring ground truth
focused-defocused images pairs as often required by other deblurring deep
learning methods. We compare our technique against a set of common sharpness
metrics optimized using gradient descent over a real-world dataset. Our results
demonstrate Deep Autofocus can produce imagery that is perceptually as good as
benchmark iterative techniques but at a substantially lower computational cost.
We conclude that our proposed Deep Autofocus can provide a more favorable
cost-quality trade-off than state-of-the-art alternatives with significant

models are commonly implemented as a single-path stream to enrich feature
representations from low-quality (LQ) input space for final predictions, which
fail to fully incorporate preceding low-level contexts into later high-level
features within networks, thereby producing inferior results. In this paper, we
present a deep interleaved network (DIN) that learns how information at
different states should be combined for high-quality (HQ) images
reconstruction. The proposed DIN follows a multi-path and multi-branch pattern
allowing multiple interconnected branches to interleave and fuse at different
states. In this way, the shallow information can guide deep representative
features prediction to enhance the feature expression ability. Furthermore, we
propose asymmetric co-attention (AsyCA) which is attached at each interleaved
node to model the feature dependencies. Such AsyCA can not only adaptively
emphasize the informative features from different states, but also improves the
discriminative ability of networks. Our presented DIN can be trained end-to-end
and applied to various IR tasks. Comprehensive evaluations on public benchmarks
and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed DIN perform favorably

methods used to measure software product and processes complexity have been
thoroughly debated in the literature. However, the discernment about the
possible links between these two dimensions, particularly on the benefits of
using the process perspective, has a long journey ahead. Objective: To improve
the understanding of the liaison of developers' activities and software
complexity within a refactoring task, namely by evaluating if process metrics
gathered from the IDE, using process mining methods and tools, are suitable to
accurately classify different refactoring practices and the resulting software
complexity. Method: We mined source code metrics from a software product after
a quality improvement task was given in parallel to (117) software developers,
organized in (71) teams. Simultaneously, we collected events from their IDE
work sessions (320) and used process mining to model their processes and
extract the correspondent metrics. Results: Most teams using a plugin for
refactoring (JDeodorant) reduced software complexity more effectively and with
simpler processes than the ones that performed refactoring using only Eclipse
native features. We were able to find moderate correlations (43%) between
software cyclomatic complexity and process cyclomatic complexity. The best
models found for the refactoring method and cyclomatic complexity level
predictions, had an accuracy of 92.95% and 94.36%, respectively. Conclusions:
Our approach agnostic to programming languages, geographic location, or
development practices. Initial findings are encouraging, and lead us to suggest
practitioners may use our method in other development tasks, such as, defect
analysis and unit or integration tests.

the composition of the seed bank undergoes lower temporal variability than the
standing vegetation in a nine-year study in Mediterranean, semi-arid, and arid
ecosystems. The composition of the seed bank was estimated by collecting soil
cores from the studied sites on an annual basis. Seedling emergence under
optimal watering conditions was measured in each soil core for three
consecutive years, to account for seed dormancy. In all sites, the composition
of the seed bank differed from the vegetation throughout the years.
Small-seeded and dormant-seeded species had a higher frequency in the seed bank
than in the standing vegetation. In contrast, functional group membership
(grasses vs. forbs) did not explain differences in species frequency between
the seed bank and the vegetation after controlling for differences between
grasses and forbs in seed mass and seed dormancy. Contrary to predictions, the
magnitude of year-to-year variability (the mean compositional dissimilarity
between consecutive years) was not lower in the seed bank than in the
vegetation in all sites. However, long-term compositional trends in the seed
bank were weaker than in the vegetation in the Mediterranean and semi-arid
sites. In the arid site where year-to-year variability was highest, no
long-term trends were observed. Overall, the effect of the seed bank on the
temporal variability of the vegetation in annual communities depends on site
conditions and time scale. While the year-to-year variability of the seed bank

in the plane and we develop a theory for this equation, extending results from
the plane to higher dimension. The reduction to a first order system applies
both to linear as well as quasilinear second order equations and we believe
this to be of independent interest. Using the first order system, we give a new
representation formula of the solution of the Dirichlet problem both on simply

singular integral operators of convolution type and Neumann series there of,
for which classical Calder\'on-Zygmund theory is applicable. Moreover, no use

solutions of constant coefficient operators. Remarkably, this representation
formula applies also for solutions of the fully non-linear first order system.

storing and manipulating quantum information using their long coherence ground
state manifold; individual defects can be entangled using photon-photon
interactions, offering a path toward large scale quantum photonic networks.
Quantum computing protocols place strict limits on the acceptable photon losses
in the system. These low-loss requirements cannot be achieved without photonic
engineering, but are attainable if combined with state-of-the-art nanophotonic
technologies. However, most materials that host spin defects are challenging to
process: as a result, the performance of quantum photonic devices is orders of
magnitude behind that of their classical counterparts. Silicon carbide (SiC) is
well-suited to bridge the classical-quantum photonics gap, since it hosts
promising optically-addressable spin defects and can be processed into
SiC-on-insulator for scalable, integrated photonics. In this Perspective, we
discuss recent progress toward the development of scalable quantum photonic
technologies based on solid state spins in silicon carbide, and discuss current
challenges and future directions.

essential to improve the key performance metric of computing circuits, i.e.,

device concept for energy-efficient, steep-slope transistors based on
heterojunctions of 2D materials. We show that by injecting electrons from an
isolated and weakly dispersive band into a strongly dispersive one,
subthermionic subthreshold swings can be obtained, as a result of a cold-source
effect and of a reduced thermalization of carriers. This mechanism is
implemented by integrating in a MOSFET architecture two different monolayer
materials coupled through a van der Waals heterojunction, combining the
subthermionic behavior of tunnel field-effect transistors (FETs) with the
robustness of a MOSFET architecture against performance-degrading factors, such
as traps, band tails and roughness. A further advantage with respect to tunnel
FETs is that only an n-type or p-type doping is required to fabricate the
device. In order to demonstrate the device concept and to discuss the
underlying physics and the design options, we study through abinitio and
full-quantum transport simulations a possible implementation that exploits two
recently reported 2D materials.

quantization is an appealing framework that expresses multiple parameters using

on a range of core vision and natural language processing tasks. Key to the
success of vector quantization is deciding which parameter groups should be
compressed together. Previous work has relied on heuristics that group the
spatial dimension of individual convolutional filters, but a general solution
remains unaddressed. This is desirable for pointwise convolutions (which
dominate modern architectures), linear layers (which have no notion of spatial
dimension), and convolutions (when more than one filter is compressed to the
same codeword). In this paper we make the observation that the weights of two
adjacent layers can be permuted while expressing the same function. We then
establish a connection to rate-distortion theory and search for permutations
that result in networks that are easier to compress. Finally, we rely on an
annealed quantization algorithm to better compress the network and achieve
higher final accuracy. We show results on image classification, object
detection, and segmentation, reducing the gap with the uncompressed model by 40
to 70% with respect to the current state of the art.

a number of applications, it would be highly desirable to shape and coherently
control the spatial waveform of the spin waves before spontaneous emission can
occur. This paper details a recently developed optical control technique to
achieve this goal, where counter-propagating, shaped sub-nanosecond pulses
impart sub-wavelength geometric phases to the spin waves by cyclically driving
an auxiliary transition. In particular, we apply this technique to reversibly
shift the wave vector of a spin wave on the $D2$ line of laser-cooled $^{87}$Rb
atoms, by driving an auxiliary $D1$ transition with shape-optimized pulses, so
as to shut off and recall superradiance on demand. We investigate a
spin-dependent momentum transfer during the spin-wave control process, which
leads to a transient optical force as large as $\sim 1\hbar k$/ns, and study
the limitations to the achieved $70\sim 75\%$ spin wave control efficiency by
jointly characterizing the spin-wave control and matterwave acceleration. Aided
by numerical modeling, we project potential future improvements of the control
fidelity to the $99\%$ level when the atomic states are better prepared and by
equipping a faster and more powerful pulse shaper. Our technique also enables a
background-free measurement of the superradiant emission to unveil the precise
scaling of the emission intensity and decay rate with optical depth.

extracts and fuses features from all layers of CNN using our novel and
computationally efficient Gated Average Fusion (GAF) network, a decisive

front view information generated by depth data. CNN is employed to extract
feature maps from both input modalities. GAF network fuses the extracted
features effectively while preserving the dimensionality of fused feature as
well. The proposed MGAF network has structural extensibility and can be
unfolded to more than two modalities. Experiments on three publicly available
multimodal HAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed MGAF outperforms the
previous state of the art fusion methods for depth-inertial HAR in terms of
recognition accuracy while being computationally much more efficient. We
increase the accuracy by an average of 1.5 percent while reducing the
computational cost by approximately 50 percent over the previous state of the
art.

classifiers of 90-day LVAD mortality. This paper also introduces the precision
recall curve (PRC) as a supplemental metric that is more representative of LVAD
classifiers performance in predicting the minority class.
  Background: In the LVAD domain, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
is a commonly applied metric of performance of classifiers. However, ROC can
provide a distorted view of classifiers ability to predict short-term mortality
due to the overwhelmingly greater proportion of patients who survive, i.e.
imbalanced data.
  Methods: This study compared the ROC and PRC for the outcome of two
classifiers for 90-day LVAD mortality for 800 patients (test group) recorded in
INTERMACS who received a continuous-flow LVAD between 2006 and 2016 (mean age
of 59 years; 146 females vs. 654 males) in which mortality rate is only %8 at
90-day (imbalanced data). The two classifiers were HeartMate Risk Score (HMRS)
and a Random Forest (RF).
  Results: The ROC indicates fairly good performance of RF and HRMS classifiers
with Area Under Curves (AUC) of 0.77 vs. 0.63, respectively. This is in
contrast with their PRC with AUC of 0.43 vs. 0.16 for RF and HRMS,
respectively. The PRC for HRMS showed the precision rapidly dropped to only 10%
with slightly increasing sensitivity.
  Conclusion: The ROC can portray an overly-optimistic performance of a
classifier or risk score when applied to imbalanced data. The PRC provides
better insight about the performance of a classifier by focusing on the
minority class.

are waiting to observe the next galactic supernova and several theoretical
simulations of supernova neutrinos are underway. While these simulation
concentrate mainly on only the first one second after the supernova bounce, the
only observation of a supernova with neutrinos, SN 1987A, revealed that
neutrino emission lasts for more than 10 seconds. For this reason, long-time
simulation and analysis tools are needed to compare theories with the next
observation. Our study is to develop an integrated supernova analysis framework
to prepare an analysis pipeline for treating galactic supernovae observations
in the near future. This framework deals with the core-collapse, bounce and
proto-neutron star cooling processes, as well as with neutrino detection on
earth in a consistent manner. We have developed a new long-time supernova
simulation in one dimension that explodes successfully and computes the
neutrino emission for up to 20 seconds. Using this model we estimate the
resulting neutrino signal in the Super-Kamiokande detector to be about 1,800

prohibition on faster-than-light motion, the electron must be larger than a
certain minimum size if it is to have the correct angular momentum and magnetic

the economy worldwide. Currently, COVID-19 evolves in many countries to a
second stage, characterized by the need for the liberation of the economy and
relaxation of the human psychological effects. To this end, numerous countries
decided to implement adequate deconfinement strategies. After the first
prolongation of the established confinement, Morocco moves to the deconfinement
stage on May 20, 2020. The relevant question concerns the impact on the
COVID-19 propagation by considering an additional degree of realism related to
stochastic noises due to the effectiveness level of the adapted measures. In
this paper, we propose a delayed stochastic mathematical model to predict the
epidemiological trend of COVID-19 in Morocco after the deconfinement. To ensure
the well-posedness of the model, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a
positive solution. Based on the large number theorem for martingales, we
discuss the extinction of the disease under an appropriate threshold parameter.
Moreover, numerical simulations are performed in order to test the efficiency
of the deconfinement strategies chosen by the Moroccan authorities to help the
policy makers and public health administration to make suitable decisions in
the near future.

one of the key symptoms. Studies show that in these cases, voice production is
also adversely affected -- vocal fold oscillations are asynchronous,
asymmetrical and more restricted during phonation. This paper proposes a method
that analyzes the differential dynamics of the glottal flow waveform (GFW)
during voice production to identify features in them that are most significant
for the detection of COVID-19 from voice. Since it is hard to measure this
directly in COVID-19 patients, we infer it from recorded speech signals and
compare it to the GFW computed from physical model of phonation. For normal
voices, the difference between the two should be minimal, since physical models
are constructed to explain phonation under assumptions of normalcy. Greater
differences implicate anomalies in the bio-physical factors that contribute to
the correctness of the physical model, revealing their significance indirectly.
Our proposed method uses a CNN-based 2-step attention model that locates
anomalies in time-feature space in the difference of the two GFWs, allowing us
to infer their potential as discriminative features for classification. The
viability of this method is demonstrated using a clinically curated dataset of
COVID-19 positive and negative subjects.

example, we focus on the decentralized setting, where agents do not share their
learned preferences with a central authority. Our approach is based on the
representation of preferences in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, and a
learning algorithm for preferences that accounts for uncertainty due to the
competition among the agents in the market. Under regularity conditions, we
show that our estimator of preferences converges at a minimax optimal rate.
Given this result, we derive optimal strategies that maximize agents' expected
payoffs and we calibrate the uncertain state by taking opportunity costs into
account. We also derive an incentive-compatibility property and show that the
outcome from the learned strategies has a stability property. Finally, we prove
a fairness property that asserts that there exists no justified envy according

probability or probabilistic logic reasonably. This paper tries to unify
statistics and logic so that we can use both statistical probability and
logical probability at the same time. For this purpose, this paper proposes the
P-T probability framework, which is assembled with Shannon's statistical
probability framework for communication, Kolmogorov's probability axioms for
logical probability, and Zadeh's membership functions used as truth functions.
Two kinds of probabilities are connected by an extended Bayes' theorem, with
which we can convert a likelihood function and a truth function from one to
another. Hence, we can train truth functions (in logic) by sampling
distributions (in statistics). This probability framework was developed in the
author's long-term studies on semantic information, statistical learning, and
color vision. This paper first proposes the P-T probability framework and
explains different probabilities in it by its applications to semantic
information theory. Then, this framework and the semantic information methods
are applied to statistical learning, statistical mechanics, hypothesis
evaluation (including falsification), confirmation, and Bayesian reasoning.
Theoretical applications illustrate the reasonability and practicability of
this framework. This framework is helpful for interpretable AI. To interpret
neural networks, we need further study.

  Material",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Producing or sharing Child Sexual Exploitation Material (CSEM) is a serious
crime fought vigorously by Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). When an LEA seizes
a computer from a potential producer or consumer of CSEM, they need to analyze
the suspect's hard disk's files looking for pieces of evidence. However, a
manual inspection of the file content looking for CSEM is a time-consuming
task. In most cases, it is unfeasible in the amount of time available for the
Spanish police using a search warrant. Instead of analyzing its content,
another approach that can be used to speed up the process is to identify CSEM
by analyzing the file names and their absolute paths. The main challenge for
this task lies behind dealing with short text distorted deliberately by the
owners of this material using obfuscated words and user-defined naming
patterns. This paper presents and compares two approaches based on short text
classification to identify CSEM files. The first one employs two independent
supervised classifiers, one for the file name and the other for the path, and
their outputs are later on fused into a single score. Conversely, the second
approach uses only the file name classifier to iterate over the file's absolute
path. Both approaches operate at the character n-grams level, while binary and
orthographic features enrich the file name representation, and a binary
Logistic Regression model is used for classification. The presented file
classifier achieved an average class recall of 0.98. This solution could be
integrated into forensic tools and services to support Law Enforcement Agencies
to identify CSEM without tackling every file's visual content, which is
computationally much more highly demanding.

reduce the average attack success rate from 99.7% to 1.9% with a 5.5% loss of

drops to 6.4%, with only a 1.7% loss of test accuracy. Further experiments

applied to arbitrary complex network structures and has recently been extended
to stochastic dynamical systems. This paper provides an overview of the

restrictions of invisibility cloaks based on using media that support
superluminal (faster than light in free space) group and phase velocities. As
illustrated in Fig. 1 of the original article, a wave packet propagating
through such a fast-light cloak is alleged to be able to reach the side behind
the cloaked object simultaneously with a corresponding wave packet propagating
through the shorter, direct route in free space without the object, so that ""no
shadow or waveform distortion arises."" As the authors claim, the ""extra
pathlength is balanced out by the correspondingly larger group velocity of the
pulse in the cloak"", which allows to ""restore the incident field distribution
all around the object in, both, amplitude and phase"". This fast-light effect
may be achieved in a broadband fashion using active (gain) materials. The
authors claim that such a fast-light cloak can hide an object, even from
time-of-flight detection techniques, and achieve invisibility ""over any desired
frequency band."" We disagree with these claims and believe that a thorough
clarification of the ideas put forward in the original article is important and
necessary for the broad wave-physics community. Specifically, in this comment
we clarify that invisibility cloaks based on fast-light media suffer from
fundamental bandwidth restrictions that arise due to causality, the nature of
superluminal wave propagation, and the stability issues of active systems.
These limitations and issues were not addressed in [Tsakmakidis, et al., Nat
Commun 10 (2019)]. Most importantly, we show that the material model considered
in the original article is unphysical.

a deep reinforcement neural network called DeepFoldit to improve the score
assigned to an unfolded protein, using the Q-learning method with experience
replay. This paper is focused on model improvement through hyperparameter
tuning. We examined various implementations by examining different model
architectures and changing hyperparameter values to improve the accuracy of the
model. The new model hyper-parameters also improved its ability to generalize.
Initial results, from the latest implementation, show that given a set of small
unfolded training proteins, DeepFoldit learns action sequences that improve the
score both on the training set and on novel test proteins. Our approach
combines the intuitive user interface of Foldit with the efficiency of deep
reinforcement learning.

wireless communications and plays an evolutionary role to enhance Physical
Layer (PHY) of 5th Generation (5G) and Beyond 5G (B5G) systems. In this paper,
we focus on the ML-based channel estimation for 2- Dimensional (2D) massive
antenna arrays. Due to the extremely high computational requirement for 2D
arrays with Ordinary Training, we exploit 2D Kronecker covariance model to
perform Subspace Training for vertical and horizontal spatial domain
independently, which achieves a complexity cost saving factor $O(M^4N^4)/O(MN^4
+ NM^4)$ for ML with an $M \times N$ 2D array. Furthermore, we propose an
iterative training approach, referred to as Turbo-AI. Along with Subspace
Training, the new approach can monotonically reduce the effective variance of
additive noise of the observation, and update the Neural Network (NN) models by
re-training. Furthermore, we propose a concept, named Universal Training. It
allows to use one NN for a wide range of Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) operation
points and spatial angles, which can greatly simplify Turbo-AI usage. Numerical
results exhibit that Turbo-AI can tightly approach the genie-aided channel
estimation bound, especially at low SNR.

learning can help with this task, by pre-training a model to extract universal
features on the full universe of stocks of the S$\&$P500 index and then
transferring it to another model to directly learn a trading rule. Transferred
models present more than double the risk-adjusted returns than their
counterparts trained from zero. In addition, we propose the use of data
augmentation on the feature space defined as the output of a pre-trained model
(i.e. augmenting the aggregated time-series representation). We compare this
augmentation approach with the standard one, i.e. augmenting the time-series in
the input space. We show that augmentation methods on the feature space leads
to $20\%$ increase in risk-adjusted return compared to a model trained with
transfer learning but without augmentation.

spatio-temporal information and event-driven signal processing, which is very
suited for energy-efficient implementation in neuromorphic hardware. However,
the unique working mode of SNNs makes them more difficult to train than
traditional networks. Currently, there are two main routes to explore the
training of deep SNNs with high performance. The first is to convert a
pre-trained ANN model to its SNN version, which usually requires a long coding
window for convergence and cannot exploit the spatio-temporal features during
training for solving temporal tasks. The other is to directly train SNNs in the
spatio-temporal domain. But due to the binary spike activity of the firing
function and the problem of gradient vanishing or explosion, current methods
are restricted to shallow architectures and thereby difficult in harnessing
large-scale datasets (e.g. ImageNet). To this end, we propose a
threshold-dependent batch normalization (tdBN) method based on the emerging
spatio-temporal backpropagation, termed ""STBP-tdBN"", enabling direct training
of a very deep SNN and the efficient implementation of its inference on
neuromorphic hardware. With the proposed method and elaborated shortcut
connection, we significantly extend directly-trained SNNs from a shallow
structure ( < 10 layer) to a very deep structure (50 layers). Furthermore, we
theoretically analyze the effectiveness of our method based on ""Block Dynamical
Isometry"" theory. Finally, we report superior accuracy results including 93.15
% on CIFAR-10, 67.8 % on DVS-CIFAR10, and 67.05% on ImageNet with very few
timesteps. To our best knowledge, it's the first time to explore the
directly-trained deep SNNs with high performance on ImageNet.

the signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR), at the users. The weak user
benefits from receiving multiple copies of the signal whereas the strong user
benefits from the higher power allocation. Numerical simulation results show
that the proposed scheme has a lower mutual outage probability (MOP) and offers
better reliability as compared to the conventional power allocation scheme for
CONOMA. An exact closed-form expression of MOP is derived for the two-user

stages (dominating possession, making more ball carries, making more passes,
winning more rucks, and making less tackles) did not contribute to success at
