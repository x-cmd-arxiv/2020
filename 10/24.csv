implemented with seminal backbone networks, among them the two arguably most
famous ones are ResNet and DenseNet. Despite their competitive performance and
overwhelming popularity, inherent drawbacks exist for both of them. For ResNet,
the identity shortcut that stabilizes training also limits its representation
capacity, while DenseNet has a higher capacity with multi-layer feature
concatenation. However, the dense concatenation causes a new problem of
requiring high GPU memory and more training time. Partially due to this, it is
not a trivial choice between ResNet and DenseNet. This paper provides a unified
perspective of dense summation to analyze them, which facilitates a better
understanding of their core difference. We further propose dense weighted
normalized shortcuts as a solution to the dilemma between them. Our proposed
dense shortcut inherits the design philosophy of simple design in ResNet and
DenseNet. On several benchmark datasets, the experimental results show that the
proposed DSNet achieves significantly better results than ResNet, and achieves
comparable performance as DenseNet but requiring fewer computation resources.

slight distortion into the signal, which can be the basis of a spoofing

non-perturbatively for the effect of local disorder, and to include the
contribution of all collective modes, i.e. superconducting amplitude (Higgs)

with previous work, already at small disorder the quasiparticle response is
dominated by paramagnetic effects. We further demonstrate that paramagnetic
processes mediate also the response of all collective modes, with a substantial
contribution of charge/phase fluctuations. These processes, which have been
overlooked so far, turn out to dominate the third-order current at strong
disorder. In addition, we show that disorder strongly influences the

by its structural instability often arising from ion migration and defect
formation. While it is generally understood that ion instability is a primary
cause for degradation, there is still a lack of direct evidence of structural
transformation at the atomistic scale. Such an understanding is crucial to
evaluate and pin-point how such instabilities are induced relative to external
perturbations such as illumination or electrical bias with time, allowing
researchers to devise effective strategies to mitigate them. Here, we designed
an in-situ TEM setup to enable real-time observation of amorphization in double
cation mixed perovskite materials under electrical biasing at 1 V. It is found
that amorphization occurs along the (001) and (002) planes, which represents
the observation of in-situ facet-dependent amorphization of a perovskite

found to recrystallize, effectively regaining its performance losses. This work

they mostly focus on addressing a specific bias, and while they improve the
performance on adversarial evaluation sets of the targeted bias, they may bias
the model in other ways, and therefore, hurt the overall robustness. In this
paper, we propose to augment the input sentences in the training data with
their corresponding predicate-argument structures, which provide a higher-level
abstraction over different realizations of the same meaning and help the model
to recognize important parts of sentences. We show that without targeting a
specific bias, our sentence augmentation improves the robustness of transformer

difficult-to-escape ""trap"" states, under a given controller. We first learn
dynamics for a system without traps from a randomly collected training set
(since we do not know what traps will be encountered online). These ""nominal""
dynamics allow us to perform tasks in scenarios where the dynamics matches the
training data, but when unexpected traps arise in execution, we must find a way
to adapt our dynamics and control strategy and continue attempting the task.
Our approach, Trap-Aware Model Predictive Control (TAMPC), is a two-level
hierarchical control algorithm that reasons about traps and non-nominal
dynamics to decide between goal-seeking and recovery policies. An important
requirement of our method is the ability to recognize nominal dynamics even
when we encounter data that is out-of-distribution w.r.t the training data. We
achieve this by learning a representation for dynamics that exploits invariance

Planck 2018, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Redshift Space
Distortions (BAO/RSD) from the BOSS DR12, the 6DF Galaxy Survey, the SDSS DR7
Main Galaxy Sample, the correlation of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest absorption and
quasars from SDSS-DR14, Supernova Type Ia (SNe) from the Pantheon compilation,

available datasets, we analyze MG models where we alternatively set some of the
MG parameters to their GR values and vary the others. Using functional forms,
we find an up to 3.5-$\sigma$ tension with GR in $\Sigma$ (while $\mu$ is
fixed) when using Planck+SNe+BAO+RSD; this goes away when lensing data is
included, i.e. CMB lensing and DES (CMBL+DES). Using different binning methods,
we find that a tension with GR above 2-$\sigma$ in the (high-z, high-k) bin is
persistent even when including CMBL+DES to Planck+SNe+BAO+RSD. Also, we find
another tension above 2-$\sigma$ in the (low-z, high-k) bin, but that can be
reduced with the addition of lensing data. Furthermore, we perform a model
comparison using the Deviance Information Criterion statistical tool and find
that the MG model ($\mu=1$, $\Sigma$) is weakly favored by the data compared to
$\Lambda$CDM, except when DES data is included. Another noteworthy result is
that we find that the binning methods do not agree with the widely-used
functional parameterization where the MG parameters are proportional to
$\Omega_{\text{DE}}(a)$, and this is clearly apparent in the high-z and high-k
regime where this parameterization underestimates the deviations from GR.

its choice will impact the subsequent inference. It is therefore important to
have a convenient way to quantify this impact, as such a measure of prior
impact will help us to choose between two or more priors in a given situation.
A recently proposed approach consists in determining the Wasserstein distance
between posteriors resulting from two distinct priors, revealing how close or
distant they are. In particular, if one prior is the uniform/flat prior, this
distance leads to a genuine measure of prior impact for the other prior. While
highly appealing and successful from a theoretical viewpoint, this proposal
suffers from practical limitations: it requires prior distributions to be
nested, posterior distributions should not be of a too complex form, in most
considered settings the exact distance was not computed but sharp upper and
lower bounds were proposed, and the proposal so far is restricted to scalar
parameter settings. In this paper, we overcome all these limitations by
introducing a practical version of this theoretical approach, namely the
Wasserstein Impact Measure (WIM). In three simulated scenarios, we will compare
the WIM to the theoretical Wasserstein approach, as well as to two competitor
prior impact measures from the literature. We finally illustrate the
versatility of the WIM by applying it on two datasets.

apparent horizon, which is composed of marginally outer trapped surfaces

Christodoulou and under a general anisotropic condition introduced by
Klainerman, Luk and Rodnianski, for $3+1$ EVEs we prove that in the process of
gravitational collapse, a smooth and spacelike apparent horizon (dynamical
horizon) emerges from general (both isotropic and anisotropic) initial data.
This dynamical horizon censors singularities formed in gravitational collapse
from non-trapped local observers near the center, and it also enables the
extension of black hole thermodynamical theory along the apparent horizon to
anisotropic scenarios. Our analysis builds on scale-critical hyperbolic method
and non-perturbative elliptic techniques. New observations and equation
structures are exploited. Geometrically, we furthermore construct explicit
finger-type single and multi-valley anisotropic apparent horizons. They are the
first mathematical examples of the anisotropic MOTS and the anisotropic

ME1 is trained to predict only the position of outflows, while MF is trained to
predict the fraction of the mass coming from outflows in each voxel. The two
models successfully identify all 60 previously visually identified outflows in
Perseus. Additionally, CASI-3D finds 20 new high-confidence outflows. All of
these have coherent high-velocity structures, and 17 of them have nearby young
stellar objects, while the remaining three are outside the Spitzer survey
coverage. The mass, momentum and energy of individual outflows in Perseus
predicted by model MF is comparable to the previous estimations. This
similarity is due to a cancelation in errors: previous calculations missed
outflow material with velocities comparable to the cloud velocity, however,
they compensate for this by over-estimating the amount of mass at higher
velocities that has contamination from non-outflow gas. We show outflows likely
driven by older sources have more high-velocity gas compared to those driven by

observations suggesting that the presence of air-water interfaces can
generically inactivate and kill viruses, yet the mechanism underlying this

also show that the fate of a virus approaching a generic liquid-liquid

electrostatic forces, which can be tuned, for instance, by choosing different
media to contact a virus-laden respiratory droplet. We propose that these
results can be used to design effective strategies for surface disinfection.
Intriguingly, tunability requires electrostatic and interfacial forces to scale
similarly with viral size, which naturally occurs when charges are arranged in
a double-shell distribution as in RNA viruses like influenza and all

quarantine. BCT ignores the inherent uncertainty in contacts and the infection
process, which could be used to tailor messaging to high-risk individuals, and
prompt proactive testing or earlier warnings. It also does not make use of
observations such as symptoms or pre-existing medical conditions, which could
be used to make more accurate infectiousness predictions. In this paper, we use
a recently-proposed COVID-19 epidemiological simulator to develop and test
methods that can be deployed to a smartphone to locally and proactively predict
an individual's infectiousness (risk of infecting others) based on their
contact history and other information, while respecting strong privacy
constraints. Predictions are used to provide personalized recommendations to
the individual via an app, as well as to send anonymized messages to the
individual's contacts, who use this information to better predict their own
infectiousness, an approach we call proactive contact tracing (PCT). We find a
deep-learning based PCT method which improves over BCT for equivalent average
mobility, suggesting PCT could help in safe re-opening and second-wave
prevention.

intelligent reflective surfaces (IRSs)-aided communication system is presented.
First, the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which is attainable through the
direct and reflected channels, is quantified by controlling the phase shifts of
the distributed IRS. Next, this optimal SNR is statistically characterized by
deriving tight approximations to the exact probability density function (PDF)
and cumulative distribution function (CDF) for Nakagami-$m$ fading. The
accuracy/tightness of this statistical characterization is investigated by
deriving the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our PDF/CDF analysis is used to
derive tight approximations/bounds for the outage probability, achievable rate,
and average symbol error rate (SER) in closed-form. To obtain useful insights,
the asymptotic outage probability and average SER are derived for the high SNR
regime. Thereby, the achievable diversity order and array gains are quantified.
Our asymptotic performance analysis reveals that the diversity order can be
boosted by using distributed passive IRSs without generating additional
electromagnetic (EM) waves via active radio frequency chains. Our asymptotic
rate analysis shows that the lower and upper rate bounds converge to an
asymptotic limit in large reflective element regime. Our analysis is validated
via Monte-Carlo simulations. We present a rigorous set of numerical results to
investigate the performance gains of the proposed system model. Our analytical
and numerical results reveal that the performance of single-input single-output
wireless systems can be boosted by recycling the EM waves generated by a
transmitter through distributed passive IRS reflections to enable constructive
signal combining at a receiver.

(IRS)-aided wireless system are presented. By optimizing the IRS phase-shift
matrix, the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is maximized at the
destination in the presence of both reflected and direct channels. The
probability distributions of this maximum SNR are tightly approximated for the
moderate-to-large reflective element regime. Thereby, the probability density
function and cumulative distribution function of this tight SNR approximation
are derived in closed-form for Nakagami-m fading to facilitate a statistical
characterization of the performance metrics. The outage probability, average
symbol error probability, and achievable rate bounds are derived. By virtue of
an asymptotic analysis in the high SNR regime, the diversity order is
quantified. Thereby, we reveal that the overall diversity order can be scaled
as a function of the number of reflective elements (N) such that Gd = mv +
min(mg;mh)N, where mv, mh and mg are the Nakagami-m parameters of the direct,
source-to-IRS and IRS-to-destination channels, respectively. The asymptotic
achievable rate is derived, and thereby, it is shown that the transmit power
can be scaled inversely proportional to N2. The impact of quantized IRS
phase-shifts is investigated by deriving the achievable rate bounds. Useful
insights are obtained by analyzing the system performance for different
severity of fading cases including spatially correlated fading. Our analysis
and numerical results reveal that IRS is a promising technology for boosting
the performance of wireless communications by intelligently controlling the
propagation channels without employing additional active radio-frequency

accelerate the processing of complex geometric operations. However,
approximations are typically only used in a first filtering step to determine a
set of candidate spatial objects that may fulfill the query condition. To
provide accurate results, the exact geometries of the candidate objects are
tested against the query condition, which is typically an expensive operation.
Nevertheless, many emerging applications (e.g., visualization tools) require
interactive responses, while only needing approximate results. Besides,
real-world geospatial data is inherently imprecise, which makes exact data
processing unnecessary. Given the uncertainty associated with spatial data and
the relaxed precision requirements of many applications, this vision paper
advocates for approximate spatial data processing techniques that omit exact
geometric tests and provide final answers solely on the basis of (fine-grained)
approximations. Thanks to recent hardware advances, this vision can be realized
today. Furthermore, our approximate techniques employ a distance-based error
bound, i.e., a bound on the maximum spatial distance between false (or missing)
and exact results which is crucial for meaningful analyses. This bound allows
to control the precision of the approximation and trade accuracy for
performance.

that is consistent with four times the 3.73 day orbital period. These periods
agree with a previously suggested correlation between superorbital and orbital
periods in similar HMXBs. During the ~14 years of observations the superorbital
modulation changes amplitude, and since ~MJD 57,650 it was no longer detected
in the power spectrum, although a peak near the second harmonic of this was
present for some time. Measurements of the spin period of the neutron star in
the system with the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor show a long-term spin-down
trend which halted towards the end of the light curve, suggesting a connection
between dP(spin)/dt and superorbital modulation, as proposed for 2S 0114+650.
However, an earlier torque reversal from INTEGRAL observations was not
associated with superorbital modulation changes. B and V band photometry from
the Las Cumbres Observatory reveals orbital ellipsoidal photometric
variability, but no superorbital optical modulation. However the photometry was
obtained when the 14.9130 day period was no longer detected in the BAT power

constraints at these masses, we analyze GW190521 considering two different
priors for the binary's masses: uniform in mass ratio and source-frame total
mass, and uniform in source-frame component masses. For the uniform in
mass-ratio prior, we find that the component masses are $m_1^{\mathrm{src}} =
168_{-61}^{+15}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and $m_2^{\mathrm{src}} =
16_{-3}^{+33}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. The uniform in component-mass prior yields
a bimodal posterior distribution. There is a low-mass-ratio mode ($q<4$) with
$m_1^{\mathrm{src}} = 100_{-18}^{+17}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and
$m_2^{\mathrm{src}} = 57_{-16}^{+17}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and a high-mass-ratio

parameters are in the high-mass ratio mode, with $m_1^{\rm src} =
171\,M_{\odot}$ and $m_2^{\rm src} = 16\,M_{\odot}$, and a signal-to-noise
ratio of $16$. These results are consistent with the proposed ""mass gap""
produced by pair-instability in supernova. Our results differ from those
published in Abbott et al. (2020b). We find that a combination of the prior

the high-mass-ratio mode. An accretion flare in AGN J124942.3+344929 was

resolved fluid-dynamical models of unresolved scales providing an ideal
framework for data-driven parameterizations in climate models. NDEs overcome
some of the limitations of traditional neural networks (NNs) in fluid dynamical
applications in that they can readily incorporate conservation laws and
boundary conditions and are stable when integrated over time. We advocate a
method that employs a 'residual' approach, in which the NN is used to improve
upon an existing parameterization through the representation of residual fluxes
which are not captured by the base parameterization. This reduces the amount of
training required and providing a method for capturing up-gradient and nonlocal
fluxes. As an illustrative example, we consider the parameterization of free
convection of the oceanic boundary layer triggered by buoyancy loss at the
surface. We demonstrate that a simple parameterization of the process -
convective adjustment - can be improved upon by training a NDE against highly
resolved explicit models, to capture entrainment fluxes at the base of the
well-mixed layer, fluxes that convective adjustment itself cannot represent.
The augmented parameterization outperforms existing commonly used
parameterizations such as the K-Profile Parameterization (KPP). We showcase
that the NDE performs well independent of the time-stepper and that an online
training approach using differentiable simulation via the Julia scientific

analyze the generalization properties of standard gradient descent ascent (GDA)

risk in convex concave problems, we show the PPM algorithm enjoys a bounded
excess risk in the same setup. For non-convex non-concave problems, we compare
the generalization performance of stochastic GDA and GDmax algorithms where the
latter fully solves the maximization subproblem at every iteration. Our
generalization analysis suggests the superiority of GDA provided that the
minimization and maximization subproblems are solved simultaneously with
similar learning rates. We discuss several numerical results indicating the

compound growth operators and balance multiple dimensions (e.g., depth, width,

black holes. Relying on algebraic arguments and the concept of superselection
sectors, we propose the existence of certain operators whose correlations
extend across the black hole atmosphere and range into the interior. Contained
in the full algebra, these black hole intertwiners will not belong to the
subalgebra describing semiclassical bulk physics. We study this proposal in the
context of operator reconstructions for code spaces containing a large number
of microstates. As long as the atmosphere is excluded from a particular
subsystem, the global state seen under the action of the associated algebra is
maximally mixed and therefore described by a single classical background. Once
the relevant correlations are encoded, i.e. if the algebra is sufficiently
enlarged, perfect state distinguishability becomes possible. We arrive at this
by computing the von Neumann entropy which may explain the result obtained by
applying the quantum extremal surface prescription to the mixed state. We then
examine these insights in the context of black hole evaporation and argue that
information is transferred to the radiation via black hole intertwiners. We
derive the Page curve. The mechanism above suggests that black hole information
is topologically protected. An infalling observer would experience no drama.
This may resolve the unitarity problem without running into any firewall or
state puzzle, the latter being evident in generalized entropy computations. We
also examine the question of how certain wormhole topologies may be understood
given these findings. We argue that their occurrence in gravity replica
computations may be related to the maximal correlation between radiation and
atmosphere surrounding the old black hole. This may suggest a connection
between topology change and near horizon quantum gravitational effects.

gains for several natural language processing (NLP) tasks, especially in the
zero-shot cross-lingual setting. Most, if not all, of these pre-trained models
rely on the masked-language modeling (MLM) objective as the key language
learning objective. The principle behind these approaches is that predicting
the masked words with the help of the surrounding text helps learn potent
contextualized representations. Despite the strong representation learning
capability enabled by MLM, we demonstrate an inherent limitation of MLM for
multilingual representation learning. In particular, by requiring the model to
predict the language-specific token, the MLM objective disincentivizes learning
a language-agnostic representation -- which is a key goal of multilingual
pre-training. Therefore to encourage better cross-lingual representation
learning we propose the DICT-MLM method. DICT-MLM works by incentivizing the
model to be able to predict not just the original masked word, but potentially
any of its cross-lingual synonyms as well. Our empirical analysis on multiple
downstream tasks spanning 30+ languages, demonstrates the efficacy of the
proposed approach and its ability to learn better multilingual representations.

software that is most appropriate for each data partition. The full
hierarchical model is then approximated by the product of independent normal
distributions for the data component of the model. In the second stage, the
Bayesian maximum {\it a posteriori} (MAP) estimator is found by maximizing the
approximated posterior density with respect to the parameters. If the
parameters of the model can be represented as normally distributed random
effects then the second stage optimization is equivalent to fitting a
multivariate normal linear mixed model. This method can be extended to account
for common fixed parameters shared between data partitions, as well as
parameters that are distinct between partitions. In the case of distinct
parameter estimation, we consider a third stage that re-estimates the distinct
parameters for each data partition based on the results of the second stage.
This allows more information from the entire data set to properly inform the
posterior distributions of the distinct parameters. The method is demonstrated
with two ecological data sets and models, a random effects GLM and an
Integrated Population Model (IPM). The multistage results were compared to
estimates from models fit in single stages to the entire data set. Both
examples demonstrate that multistage point and posterior standard deviation
estimates closely approximate those obtained from fitting the models with all
data simultaneously and can therefore be considered for fitting hierarchical
Bayesian models when it is computationally prohibitive to do so in one step.

quality and human judgement heuristics interact to affect collective outcomes,
such as the perceived popularity of options. We address this limitation by
conducting a controlled experiment where subjects choose between two ranked
options whose quality can be independently varied. We use this data to
construct a model that quantifies how judgement heuristics and option quality
combine when deciding between two options. The model reveals popularity-ranking
can be unstable: unless the quality difference between the two options is
sufficiently high, the higher quality option is not guaranteed to be eventually
ranked on top. To rectify this instability, we create an algorithm that
accounts for judgement heuristics to infer the best option and rank it first.
This algorithm is guaranteed to be optimal if data matches the model. When the
data does not match the model, however, simulations show that in practice this
algorithm performs better or at least as well as popularity-based and
recency-based ranking for any two-choice question. Our work suggests that
algorithms relying on inference of mathematical models of user behavior can

observations of the debris/planetesimal disc surrounding HD 206893, a system

a disc extending from 30 to 180 au, split by a 27 au wide gap centred at 74 au,
and no dust surrounding the reddened brown dwarf (BD) at 11 au. The gap width
suggests the presence of a 0.9 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ planet at 74 au, which would be
the third companion in this system. Using previous astrometry of the BD,
combined with our derived disc orientation as a prior, we were able to better
constrain its orbit finding it is likely eccentric ($0.14^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$).
For the innermost companion, we used RV, proper motion anomaly and stability
considerations to show its mass and semi-major axis are likely in the range
4-100 M$_\mathrm{Jup}$ and 1.4-4.5 au. These three companions will interact on
secular timescales and perturb the orbits of planetesimals, stirring the disc
and potentially truncating it to its current extent via secular resonances.
Finally, the presence of a gap in this system adds to the growing evidence that
gaps could be common in wide exoKuiper belts. Out of 6 wide debris discs

for converting cusps into cores through reactivation of DM annihilation in
galaxies at late times. This can happen in asymmetric DM models when there is a
very small DM-number violating mass term that causes oscillations between DM
and its antiparticle. Using analytic methods as well as gravitational N-body
simulations, we show that this mechanism can robustly eliminate cusps from
galactic DM profiles for light fermionic DM of mass $m_\chi\sim (0.1-1)$ GeV
and a lighter mediator into which the DM can annihilate. We identify regions of
parameter space where annihilation of DM particles is more efficient than
elastic scattering at reducing the inner density of the DM profile. Dark matter
annihilation is therefore a qualitatively distinct alternative to the mechanism
of elastic self-interacting dark matter for addressing the cusp-core problem.

nucleus of the galaxy SDSS J143359.16+400636.0 at z=0.099 (luminosity distance
$D_{\rm L}=456$ Mpc). The transient was observed to reach a peak luminosity of
$\sim10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 0.3--10 keV X-ray band, which was $\sim20$
times more than the peak optical/UV luminosity. Optical, UV, and X-ray
lightcurves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and Swift show a decline
in flux from the source consistent with $t^{-5/3}$, and observations with
NuSTAR and Chandra show a soft X-ray spectrum with photon index
$\Gamma=2.9\pm0.1$. The X-ray/UV properties are inconsistent with well known
AGN properties and have more in common with known X-ray tidal disruption events
(TDE), leading us to conclude that it was likely a TDE. The broadband spectral
energy distribution (SED) can be described well by a disk blackbody model with
an inner disk temperature of $7.3^{+0.3}_{-0.8}\times10^{5}$ K, with a large
fraction ($>40$%) of the disk emission up-scattered into the X-ray band. An
optical spectrum taken with Keck/LRIS after the X-ray detection reveals LINER
line ratios in the host galaxy, suggesting low-level accretion on to the
supermassive black hole prior to the event, but no broad lines or other
indications of a TDE were seen. The stellar velocity dispersion implies the
mass of the supermassive black hole powering the event is log($M_{\rm

mechanisms to regulate the growth and evolution of galaxies throughout the
universe. While the gas in outflows spans a large range of temperatures and
densities, the cold molecular phase is of particular interest because molecular
outflows may be capable of suppressing star formation in galaxies by removing
the star-forming gas. We have conducted the first survey of molecular outflows
at z > 4, targeting 11 strongly-lensed dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs)
with high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations of OH
119um absorption as an outflow tracer. In this first paper, we give an overview
of the survey, focusing on the detection rate and structure of molecular
outflows. We find unambiguous evidence for outflows in 8/11 (73%) galaxies,
more than tripling the number known at z > 4. This implies that molecular winds
in z > 4 DSFGs must have both a near-unity occurrence rate and large opening
angles to be detectable in absorption. Lensing reconstructions reveal that
500pc-scale clumpy structures in the outflows are common. The individual clumps
are not directly resolved, but from optical depth arguments we expect that
future observations will require 50-200pc spatial resolution to do so. We do
not detect high-velocity [CII] wings in any of the sources with clear OH
outflows, indicating that [CII] is not a reliable tracer of molecular outflows.
Our results represent a first step toward characterizing molecular outflows at
z > 4 at the population level, demonstrating that large-scale outflows are
ubiquitous among early massive, dusty galaxies.

redistributing gas that could otherwise have formed stars. We previously
presented the first survey of molecular outflows at z > 4 towards a sample of
massive, dusty galaxies. Here we characterize the physical properties of the
molecular outflows discovered in our survey. Using low-redshift outflows as a
training set, we find agreement at the factor-of-two level between several
outflow rate estimates. We find molecular outflow rates 150-800Msun/yr and
infer mass loading factors just below unity. Among the high-redshift sources,
the molecular mass loading factor shows no strong correlations with any other
measured quantity. The outflow energetics are consistent with expectations for
momentum-driven winds with star formation as the driving source, with no need
for energy-conserving phases. There is no evidence for AGN activity in our
sample, and while we cannot rule out deeply-buried AGN, their presence is not
required to explain the outflow energetics, in contrast to nearby obscured
galaxies with fast outflows. The fraction of the outflowing gas that will
escape into the circumgalactic medium (CGM), though highly uncertain, may be as
high as 50%. This nevertheless constitutes only a small fraction of the total
cool CGM mass based on a comparison to z~2-3 quasar absorption line studies,
but could represent >~10% of the CGM metal mass. Our survey offers the first
statistical characterization of molecular outflow properties in the very early

heterogeneous databases where each is used to serve a specific need such as
storing the canonical form of data or providing advanced search capabilities.
For applications it is hence desired to keep multiple databases in sync. We
have observed a series of distinct patterns that have tried to solve this
problem such as dual-writes and distributed transactions. However, these
approaches have limitations with regard to feasibility, robustness, and
maintenance. An alternative approach that has recently emerged is to utilize
Change-Data-Capture (CDC) in order to capture changed rows from a database's
transaction log and eventually deliver them downstream with low latency. In
order to solve the data synchronization problem one also needs to replicate the
full state of a database and transaction logs typically do not contain the full
history of changes. At the same time, there are use cases that require high
availability of the transaction log events so that databases stay as closely
in-sync as possible.
  To address the above challenges, we developed a novel CDC framework for
databases, namely DBLog. DBLog utilizes a watermark based approach that allows
us to interleave transaction log events with rows that we directly select from
tables to capture the full state. Our solution allows log events to continue
progress without stalling while processing selects. Selects can be triggered at
any time on all tables, a specific table, or for specific primary keys of a
table. DBLog executes selects in chunks and tracks progress, allowing them to
pause and resume. The watermark approach does not use locks and has minimum
impact on the source. DBLog is currently used in production by tens of
microservices at Netflix.

CARLA simulator contributing to the development of the autonomous vehicle area.
Therefore, this paper presents the architecture design for the navigation of an
autonomous vehicle in a simulated urban environment that attempts to commit the
least number of traffic infractions, which used as the baseline the original
architecture of the platform for autonomous navigation CaRINA 2. Our agent
traveled in simulated scenarios for several hours, demonstrating his
capabilities, winning three out of the four tracks of the challenge, and being
ranked second in the remaining track.
  Our architecture was made towards meeting the requirements of CARLA
Autonomous Driving Challenge and has components for obstacle detection using 3D
point clouds, traffic signs detection and classification which employs
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and depth information, risk assessment with
collision detection using short-term motion prediction, decision-making with
Markov Decision Process (MDP), and control using Model Predictive Control
(MPC).

to elicit visual percepts in blind patients affected with retinal diseases by
electrically stimulating the remaining neurons on the retina. However, these
implants restored very limited visual acuity and required transcutaneous cables
traversing the eyeball, leading to reduced reliability and complex surgery with
high postoperative infection risks. Approach. To overcome the limitations
imposed by cables, a retinal implant architecture in which near-infrared
illumination carries both power and data through the pupil is presented. A high
efficiency multi-junction photovoltaic cell transduces the optical power to a
CMOS stimulator capable of delivering flexible interleaved sequential
stimulation through a diamond microelectrode array. To demonstrate the capacity
to elicit a neural response with this approach while complying with the optical
irradiance safety limit at the pupil, fluorescence imaging with a calcium
indicator is used on a degenerate rat retina. Main results. The power delivered
by the laser at safe irradiance of 4 mW/mm2 is shown to be sufficient to both
power the stimulator ASIC and elicit a response in retinal ganglion cells
(RGCs), with the ability to generate of up to 35 000 pulses per second at the
average stimulation threshold. Significance. This confirms the feasibility of
wirelessly generating a response in RGCs with a digital stimulation controller
that can deliver complex multipolar stimulation patterns at high repetition
rates.

density of states at low energies, in the absence of superconducting long-range
order. Numerous calculations of the Hubbard model show a pseudogap in the
single-particle spectra, with striking similarities to photoemission and
tunneling experiments on cuprates. However, no clear mechanism has been
established. Here, we solve the Hubbard model on $2\times2$ clusters by exact
diagonalization, with integration over twisted boundary conditions. A pseudogap
is found in the single-particle density of states with the following
characteristics: a decreasing energy scale and onset temperature for increased
hole-doping, closure at a critical hole doping near 15\%, absence upon
electron-doping, particle-hole asymmetry indicated by the location of the gap
center, and persistence in the strong-coupling limit of $U/t \to \infty$.
Studying the many-body excitation spectrum reveals that the pseudogap in
single-particle spectra is due to orthogonality between bare electrons and the
lowest energy excitations for $U/t \gtrsim 8$.

is density-stratified, with the gas density being highest at the centre of the

(homogeneous, isotropic) turbulence theory does not apply to the ICM. The gas
motions are instead explained by anisotropic stratified turbulence, with the
stratification quantified by the perpendicular Froude number
($\mathrm{Fr}_\perp$). These turbulent motions are associated with density and
pressure fluctuations, which manifest as perturbations in X-ray surface
brightness maps of the ICM and as thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZ)
fluctuations, respectively. In order to advance our understanding of the
relations between these fluctuations and the turbulent gas velocities, we have
conducted 100 high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of stratified turbulence
($256^2\times 384$ -- $1024^2\times1536$ resolution elements), in which we scan
the parameter space of subsonic rms Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$),
$\mathrm{Fr}_\perp$, and the ratio of entropy and pressure scale heights

natural extension of time domain filter-banks, in part because perfect
reconstruction, orthogonality and bi-orthogonality conditions in the graph
spectral domain resemble those for traditional filter-banks. Therefore, many of
the well known orthogonal and bi-orthogonal designs can be easily adapted for
graph signals. A major limitation is that this framework can only be applied to
the normalized Laplacian of bipartite graphs. In this paper we extend this

approach is based on a different definition of the graph Fourier transform

We construct GFTs satisfying a spectral folding property, which allows us to
easily construct orthogonal and bi-orthogonal perfect reconstruction

of a system is the topic of recent studies in the geosciences, in which the key
output is a surrogate model meant to emulate the dynamical model. In order to
treat sparse and noisy observations in a rigorous way, ML can be combined to
data assimilation (DA). This yields a class of iterative methods in which, at
each iteration a DA step assimilates the observations, and alternates with a ML
step to learn the underlying dynamics of the DA analysis. In this article, we
propose to use this method to correct the error of an existent, knowledge-based
model. In practice, the resulting surrogate model is an hybrid model between
the original (knowledge-based) model and the ML model. We demonstrate
numerically the feasibility of the method using a two-layer, two-dimensional
quasi-geostrophic channel model. Model error is introduced by the means of
perturbed parameters. The DA step is performed using the strong-constraint
4D-Var algorithm, while the ML step is performed using deep learning tools. The
ML models are able to learn a substantial part of the model error and the
resulting hybrid surrogate models produce better short- to mid-range forecasts.
Furthermore, using the hybrid surrogate models for DA yields a significantly
better analysis than using the original model.

the informativeness of synthetic images by Olah et al. (2017) with a simple
baseline visualization, namely exemplary natural images that also strongly
activate a specific feature map. Given either synthetic or natural reference
images, human participants choose which of two query images leads to strong
positive activation. The experiments are designed to maximize participants'
performance, and are the first to probe intermediate instead of final layer
representations. We find that synthetic images indeed provide helpful
information about feature map activations ($82\pm4\%$ accuracy; chance would be
$50\%$). However, natural images - originally intended as a baseline -
outperform synthetic images by a wide margin ($92\pm2\%$). Additionally,
participants are faster and more confident for natural images, whereas
subjective impressions about the interpretability of the feature visualizations
are mixed. The higher informativeness of natural images holds across most
layers, for both expert and lay participants as well as for hand- and
randomly-picked feature visualizations. Even if only a single reference image
is given, synthetic images provide less information than natural images
($65\pm5\%$ vs. $73\pm4\%$). In summary, synthetic images from a popular
feature visualization method are significantly less informative for assessing
CNN activations than natural images. We argue that visualization methods should
improve over this baseline.

  constraints","16 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables",,,,"physics.med-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Automatic planning for focal low-dose-rate prostate brachytherapy
(LDR-PB) boost.
  Methods: A simulated annealing approach was utilized for creating automatic
focal LDR-PB boost plans using both geometric (i.e. adherence of isodose
contours to structure contours) and dosimetric constraints. In 46 patients,
four unilateral focal lesion scenarios were considered as the boost region, in
the anterior/posterior and superior/inferior quadrants. Plans consisted of
seeds with two air kerma strengths (0.740U and 0.351 or 0.354U) to achieve
required dose coverage on these smaller focal targets. Plan characteristics
(including PTV V100 and V150, Rectum V50, Urethra V150, and number of needles
and seeds), were compared in terms of type of needle loading (dual vs. single
air kerma needles), boost quadrant and prostate volume. Plans were blindly
ranked on 20 consecutive cases by two experienced radiation oncologists.
  Results: Differences in plans generated using the two needle loading
techniques were not clinically significant, particularly in terms of the PTV
V100 and V150 and Urethra V150, with single air kerma loaded needles
potentially being more practical. A higher rectal dose was observed in the
posterior boost quadrants (V50 >0.18), particularly in larger prostates (>40
cc). In smaller prostates (<25 cc), obtaining adequate dose coverage while
sparing the urethra was more challenging. 88% of the plans were considered
clinically acceptable without (46%) or with (mostly minor) modifications.
  Conclusions: The novel approach of using dual air kerma seeds combined with
geometric constraints within a simulated annealing-based automatic planning
framework can lead to focal LDR-PB plans with high acceptability.

metasurfaces with non-circular cross sections based on conformal

geometries since they generally do not admit straightforward solutions to the
Helmholtz wave equation subject to the appropriate boundary conditions. This
leads to the reliance on full wave numerical techniques which are only suitable
for the analysis, but not the synthesis, of these surfaces. We address this
issue by employing conformal transformations to map the physical space into a
computational space in which the surface coincides with a circular cylinder.
The electromagnetic boundary conditions on the surface remain intact under the
transformations due to their angle-preserving nature. However, they are much
more easily enforced. As a result, analytical modal solutions for the scattered
fields are readily obtainable, which facilitate closed-form analysis and
synthesis equations for general non-circular cylindrical metasurfaces. One
important utility enabled by the proposed framework is the efficient
identification of electromagnetic field distributions that satisfy local power
conservation. This leads to passive and lossless surface designs, which are
highly desirable in practice as they do not require active and/or lossy

are most suited for point anomalies in sequence data and cannot deal with
temporal and spatial dependencies that arise in spatiotemporal data. In recent
years, tensor-based methods have been proposed for anomaly detection to address
this problem. These methods rely on conventional tensor decomposition models,
not taking the structure of the anomalies into account, and are supervised or
semi-supervised. We introduce an unsupervised tensor-based anomaly detection
method that takes the sparse and temporally continuous nature of anomalies into
account. In particular, the anomaly detection problem is formulated as a robust
lowrank + sparse tensor decomposition with a regularization term that minimizes
the temporal variation of the sparse part, so that the extracted anomalies are
temporally persistent. We also approximate rank minimization with graph total
variation minimization to reduce the complexity of the optimization algorithm.
The resulting optimization problem is convex, scalable, and is shown to be
robust against missing data and noise. The proposed framework is evaluated on
both synthetic and real spatiotemporal urban traffic data and compared with

attention in scientific machine learning. However, the vast majority of the
literature was focused on predicting separable Hamiltonian systems with their
kinematic and potential energy terms being explicitly decoupled while building
data-driven paradigms to predict nonseparable Hamiltonian systems that are
ubiquitous in fluid dynamics and quantum mechanics were rarely explored. The
main computational challenge lies in the effective embedding of symplectic
priors to describe the inherently coupled evolution of position and momentum,
which typically exhibits intricate dynamics. To solve the problem, we propose a
novel neural network architecture, Nonseparable Symplectic Neural Networks
(NSSNNs), to uncover and embed the symplectic structure of a nonseparable
Hamiltonian system from limited observation data. The enabling mechanics of our
approach is an augmented symplectic time integrator to decouple the position
and momentum energy terms and facilitate their evolution. We demonstrated the
efficacy and versatility of our method by predicting a wide range of
Hamiltonian systems, both separable and nonseparable, including chaotic
vortical flows. We showed the unique computational merits of our approach to
yield long-term, accurate, and robust predictions for large-scale Hamiltonian
systems by rigorously enforcing symplectomorphism.

fine-grained usage data provided by smart meter brings additional
vulnerabilities from users to companies. Occupancy detection is one such
example which causes privacy violation of smart meter users. Detecting the
occupancy of a home is straightforward with time of use information as there is
a strong correlation between occupancy and electricity usage. In this work, our
major contributions are twofold. First, we validate the viability of an
occupancy detection attack based on a machine learning technique called Long
Short Term Memory (LSTM) method and demonstrate improved results. In addition,
we introduce an Adversarial Machine Learning Occupancy Detection Avoidance

transmittable diseases: it traces contacts among individuals in order to alert
people about their potential risk of being infected. The current SARS-CoV-2
pandemic put a heavy strain on the healthcare system of many countries.
Governments chose different approaches to face the spread of the virus and the
contact tracing apps were considered the most effective ones. In particular, by
leveraging on the Bluetooth Low-Energy technology, mobile apps allow to achieve
a privacy-preserving contact tracing of citizens. While researchers proposed
several contact tracing approaches, each government developed its own national

  In this paper, we demonstrate that many popular contact tracing apps (e.g.,

leading to a breakdown of the healthcare system. To tackle this vulnerability,
we propose a novel and lightweight solution that prevents relay attacks, while

evaluate the feasibility of both the relay attack and our novel defence

an uncluttered yet challenging framework for understanding the impact of
non-linearity in parametrized bandits. It was shown by Faury et al. (2020) that
the learning-theoretic difficulties of Logistic Bandits can be embodied by a
large (sometimes prohibitively) problem-dependent constant $\kappa$,
characterizing the magnitude of the reward's non-linearity. In this paper we
introduce a novel algorithm for which we provide a refined analysis. This
allows for a better characterization of the effect of non-linearity and yields
improved problem-dependent guarantees. In most favorable cases this leads to a
regret upper-bound scaling as $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T/\kappa})$, which
dramatically improves over the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T}+\kappa)$
state-of-the-art guarantees. We prove that this rate is minimax-optimal by
deriving a $\Omega(d\sqrt{T/\kappa})$ problem-dependent lower-bound. Our
analysis identifies two regimes (permanent and transitory) of the regret, which
ultimately re-conciliates Faury et al. (2020) with the Bayesian approach of
Dong et al. (2019). In contrast to previous works, we find that in the
permanent regime non-linearity can dramatically ease the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. While it also impacts the length of the
transitory phase in a problem-dependent fashion, we show that this impact is
mild in most reasonable configurations.

measurements; one disk is resolved with radius ${\sim}80$ au. Two class II
sources in the field of view were also detected, and 11 other sources,
consistent with sub-mm galaxy number counts. Stacking non-detections yields a
marginal detection with mean dust mass ${\sim}0.0048M_\oplus$. We searched for
gas emission from the CO J=3-2 line, and present its detection to NO Lup
inferring a gas mass ($4.9 {\pm} 1.1$) ${\times}10^{-5} M_\oplus$ and
gas-to-dust ratio $1.0{\pm}0.4$. Combining our survey with class II sources
shows a gap in the disk mass distribution from $0.09{-}2M_\oplus$ for
${>}0.7M_\odot$ Lupus stars, evidence of rapid dispersal of mm-sized dust from
protoplanetary disks. The class III disk mass distribution is consistent with a
population model of planetesimal belts that go on to replenish the debris disks
seen around main sequence stars. This suggests that planetesimal belt formation
does not require long-lived protoplanetary disks, i.e., planetesimals form
within ${\sim}$2 Myr. While all 4 class III disks are consistent with
collisional replenishment, for two the gas and/or mid-IR emission could
indicate primordial circumstellar material in the final stages of
protoplanetary disk dispersal. Two class III stars without sub-mm detections
exhibit hot emission that could arise from ongoing planet formation processes
inside ${\sim}1$ au.

dynamics of nucleons and explicit structure of the wave functions at arbitrary

nucleon form factors measured experimentally in the cross section measurements
(by the Rosenbluth method), yielding almost equal normalized form factors
$G^p_E,G^p_M,G^n_M$, as well as in the polarization transfer experiments, where
a strongly decreasing proton electric form factor has been discovered. It is
shown, using relativistic hyperspherical formalism, that the nucleon wave
functions in the lowest approximation provide almost equal normalized form
factors as seen in the Rosenbluth cross sections, but in the higher components
they contain a large admixture of the quark orbital momenta, which strongly
decreases $G^p_E$ and this effect is possibly detected in the polarization
transfer method (not seen in the classical cross section experiments).
Moreover, the same admixture of the higher components explains the small
positive form factor $G^n_E$. The resulting form factors,
$G^p_M(Q),G^p_E(Q),G^n_M(Q)$ are calculated up to $Q^2\approx 10$ GeV$^2$,
using the standard and the Lorentz contracted wave functions and shown to be in

how to use Cloudy to model C-S gas viewed in absorption around polluted WDs.
Modeling the abundances of C-S gas around polluted WDs with Cloudy provides a

excitonic linewidth values of our samples are narrower and more uniform than
those of 2D-MoS2 obtained by most other techniques reported in literature, and
comparable to those of ultraflat h-BN-capped mechanically exfoliated samples,
indicative of their high quality. Feature-rich Raman spectra absent in samples
grown or obtained by most other techniques, also stand out as a testament of
the high quality of our samples. A contact-growth mode facilitates direct
growth of crystallographically-strained circular samples, which allows us to
directly compare the optoelectronic properties of flat vs. strained growth from
the same growth runs. Our method allows, for the first time, to quantitatively
compare the impact of strain on excitonic and Raman peak positions on
identically-synthesized 2D-MoS2. Strain leads to average Red-shifts of ~ 30 meV
in the A-exciton position, and ~ 2 cm-1 in the E12g Raman peak in these
samples. Our findings open-up several new possibilities that expand 2D material
research. By eliminating the need for carrier gas flow, mechanical motion or
chemical reactions, our method can be either miniaturized for substantially
low-cost, high-quality scientific research or potentially scaled-up for
mass-production of 2D crystals for commercial purposes. Moreover, we believe

formalism which represents sentence meaning as a directed acyclic graph. To
train most AMR parsers, one needs to segment the graph into subgraphs and align
each such subgraph to a word in a sentence; this is normally done at
preprocessing, relying on hand-crafted rules. In contrast, we treat both
alignment and segmentation as latent variables in our model and induce them as
part of end-to-end training.
  As marginalizing over the structured latent variables is infeasible, we use
the variational autoencoding framework.
  To ensure end-to-end differentiable optimization, we introduce a
differentiable relaxation of the segmentation and alignment problems. We
observe that inducing segmentation yields substantial gains over using a
`greedy' segmentation heuristic. The performance of our method also approaches
that of a model that relies on the segmentation rules of
\citet{lyu-titov-2018-amr}, which were hand-crafted to handle individual AMR

This paper provides an algebraic formalization of ownership transfer in

neural networks (RSNNs) possess great computational power and have been widely
used for processing sequential data like audio and text. However, most RSNNs
suffer from two problems. 1. Due to a lack of architectural guidance, random
recurrent connectivity is often adopted, which does not guarantee good
performance. 2. Training of RSNNs is in general challenging, bottlenecking
achievable model accuracy. To address these problems, we propose a new type of
RSNNs called Skip-Connected Self-Recurrent SNNs (ScSr-SNNs). Recurrence in
ScSr-SNNs is introduced in a stereotyped manner by adding self-recurrent
connections to spiking neurons, which implements local memory. The network
dynamics is enriched by skip connections between nonadjacent layers.
Constructed by simplified self-recurrent and skip connections, ScSr-SNNs are
able to realize recurrent behaviors similar to those of more complex RSNNs
while the error gradients can be more straightforwardly calculated due to the
mostly feedforward nature of the network. Moreover, we propose a new
backpropagation (BP) method called backpropagated intrinsic plasticity (BIP) to
further boost the performance of ScSr-SNNs by training intrinsic model
parameters. Unlike standard intrinsic plasticity rules that adjust the neuron's
intrinsic parameters according to neuronal activity, the proposed BIP methods
optimize intrinsic parameters based on the backpropagated error gradient of a
well-defined global loss function in addition to synaptic weight training.
Based upon challenging speech and neuromorphic speech datasets including
TI46-Alpha, TI46-Digits, and N-TIDIGITS, the proposed ScSr-SNNs can boost
performance by up to 2.55% compared with other types of RSNNs trained by
state-of-the-art BP methods.

trustworthiness of integrated circuits has become more challenging. Among the
security threats, IC counterfeiting and recycled ICs have received a lot of
attention due to their inferior quality, and in turn, their negative impact on
the reliability and security of the underlying devices. Detecting recycled ICs
is challenging due to the effect of process variations and process drift
occurring during the chip fabrication. Moreover, relying on a golden chip as a
basis for comparison is not always feasible. Accordingly, this paper presents a
recycled IC detection scheme based on delay side-channel testing. The proposed
method relies on the features extracted during the design flow and the sample
delays extracted from the target chip to build a Neural Network model using
which the target chip can be truly identified as new or recycled. The proposed
method classifies the timing paths of the target chip into two groups based on
their vulnerability to aging using the information collected from the design
and detects the recycled ICs based on the deviation of the delay of these two

development of diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) resulting in increased vascular
permeability and decreased alveolar gas exchange. Mechanical ventilation is a
potentially lifesaving intervention to improve oxygen exchange but has the
potential to cause ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). A general strategy to
reduce VILI is to use low tidal volume and low-pressure ventilation, but
optimal ventilator settings for an individual patient are difficult for the
bedside physician to determine and mortality from ARDS remains unacceptably
high. Motivated by the need to minimize VILI, scientists have developed models
of varying complexity to understand diseased pulmonary physiology. However,
simple models often fail to capture real-world injury while complex models tend
to not be estimable with clinical data, limiting the clinical utility of
existing models. To address this gap, we present a physiologically anchored
data-driven model to better model lung injury. Our approach relies on using
clinically relevant features in the ventilator waveform data that contain
information about pulmonary physiology, patients-ventilator interaction and
ventilator settings. Our lung model can reproduce essential physiology and
pathophysiology dynamics of differently damaged lungs for both controlled mouse
model data and uncontrolled human ICU data. The estimated parameters values
that are correlated with a known measure of lung physiology agree with the
observed lung damage. In future endeavors, this model could be used to
phenotype ventilator waveforms and serve as a basis for predicting the course
of ARDS and improving patient care.

system formation, and their physical properties have invaluable information for
evolutionary theories. Stellar occultation is a ground-based method for
studying these small bodies and has presented exciting results. These
observations can provide precise profiles of the involved body, allowing an
accurate determination of its size and shape. The goal is to show that even
single-chord detections of TNOs allow us to measure their milliarcsecond
astrometric positions in the reference frame of the Gaia second data release
(DR2). Accurated ephemerides can then be generated, allowing predictions of
stellar occultations with much higher reliability. We analyzed data from
stellar occultations to obtain astrometric positions of the involved bodies.
The events published before the Gaia era were updated so that the Gaia DR2
catalog is the reference. Previously determined sizes were used to calculate
the position of the object center and its corresponding error with respect to
the detected chord and the International Celestial Reference System (ICRS)
propagated Gaia DR2 star position. We derive 37 precise astrometric positions
for 19 TNOs and 4 Centaurs. Twenty-one of these events are presented here for
the first time. Although about 68\% of our results are based on single-chord
detection, most have intrinsic precision at the submilliarcsecond level. Lower
limits on the diameter and shape constraints for a few bodies are also
presented as valuable byproducts. Using the Gaia DR2 catalog, we show that even
a single detection of a stellar occultation allows improving the object
ephemeris significantly, which in turn enables predicting a future stellar
occultation with high accuracy. Observational campaigns can be efficiently
organized with this help, and may provide a full physical characterization of
the involved object.

conversational agent is time consuming as it requires domain experts to label
and annotate noisy data sources such as classroom videos. Previous approaches
to modeling annotations have relied on labeling thousands of examples and
calculating inter-annotator agreement and majority votes in order to model the
necessary scenarios. This method, while proven successful, ignores individual
annotator strengths in labeling a data point and under-utilizes examples that
do not have a majority vote for labeling. We propose using a multi-task weak
supervision method combined with active learning to address these concerns.
This approach requires less labeling than traditional methods and shows
significant improvements in precision, efficiency, and time-requirements than
the majority vote method (Ratner 2019). We demonstrate the validity of this
method on the Google Jigsaw data set and then propose a scenario to apply this
method using the Instructional Quality Assessment(IQA) to define the categories
for labeling. We propose using probabilistic modeling of annotator labeling to
generate active learning examples to further label the data. Active learning is
able to iteratively improve the training performance and accuracy of the
original classification model. This approach combines state-of-the art labeling
techniques of weak supervision and active learning to optimize results in the
educational domain and could be further used to lessen the data requirements
for expanded scenarios within the education domain through transfer learning.

this property leads to the unambiguous extraction of the momentum-dependent
effective gluon mass. The practical implementation of this method is carried
out in detail, and the required approximations and theoretical assumptions are
duly highlighted. The systematic improvement of this approach through the
detailed computation of one of its pivotal components is briefly outlined.

and collapse of solitonic cores, leading to supermassive black hole (SMBH)
formation. For SFDM parameters that make $\sim$ Kpc-sized cores and CDM-like
structure formation on large scales but suppressed on small scales, cores are
stable for all galactic halos of interest, from the free-field to the repulsive
SI limit. For attractive SI, however, halos masses $M_h\sim (10^{10}-10^{12})
M_\odot$ have cores that collapse to SMBHs with $M_{SMBH}\sim 10^{6}-10^8
M_\odot$, as observations seem to require, while smaller-mass halos have stable
cores, for particle masses $m\simeq (2.14\times 10^{-22}-9.9\times

repulsive cases, however, if previous constraints on particle parameters are
relaxed to allow much smaller (sub-galactic scale) cores, then halos can also
form SMBHs, for the same range of halo and BH masses, as long as $\beta = 5/9$
is correct for the free-field. In that case, structure formation in SFDM would
be largely indistinguishable from Cold Dark Matter (CDM). Such SFDM models
might not resolve the small-scale structure problems of CDM, but they would
explain the formation of SMBHs quite naturally. Since CDM, itself, has not yet
been ruled out, such SFDM models must also be viable (Abbreviated).

reinforcement learning (RL). It refers to the ability of the agent to attribute
actions to consequences that may occur after a long time interval. Existing
policy-gradient and Q-learning algorithms typically rely on dense environmental
rewards that provide rich short-term supervision and help with credit
assignment. However, they struggle to solve tasks with delays between an action
and the corresponding rewarding feedback. To make credit assignment easier,
recent works have proposed algorithms to learn dense ""guidance"" rewards that
could be used in place of the sparse or delayed environmental rewards. This
paper is in the same vein -- starting with a surrogate RL objective that
involves smoothing in the trajectory-space, we arrive at a new algorithm for
learning guidance rewards. We show that the guidance rewards have an intuitive
interpretation, and can be obtained without training any additional neural
networks. Due to the ease of integration, we use the guidance rewards in a few
popular algorithms (Q-learning, Actor-Critic, Distributional-RL) and present
results in single-agent and multi-agent tasks that elucidate the benefit of our

predictive performance and calibration of deep networks. We introduce a new
approach, Parameter Ensembling by Perturbation (PEP), that constructs an
ensemble of parameter values as random perturbations of the optimal parameter
set from training by a Gaussian with a single variance parameter. The variance
is chosen to maximize the log-likelihood of the ensemble average ($\mathbb{L}$)
on the validation data set. Empirically, and perhaps surprisingly, $\mathbb{L}$
has a well-defined maximum as the variance grows from zero (which corresponds
to the baseline model). Conveniently, calibration level of predictions also
tends to grow favorably until the peak of $\mathbb{L}$ is reached. In most
experiments, PEP provides a small improvement in performance, and, in some
cases, a substantial improvement in empirical calibration. We show that this
""PEP effect"" (the gain in log-likelihood) is related to the mean curvature of
the likelihood function and the empirical Fisher information. Experiments on
ImageNet pre-trained networks including ResNet, DenseNet, and Inception showed
improved calibration and likelihood. We further observed a mild improvement in
classification accuracy on these networks. Experiments on classification
benchmarks such as MNIST and CIFAR-10 showed improved calibration and
likelihood, as well as the relationship between the PEP effect and overfitting;
this demonstrates that PEP can be used to probe the level of overfitting that
occurred during training. In general, no special training procedure or network
architecture is needed, and in the case of pre-trained networks, no additional
training is needed.

determined by dynamic 82Rb PET in fourteen human subjects with heart disease.
Two sets of FDG K1 were derived from one-hour dynamic FDG scans. One was the
original FDG K1 estimates and the other was the corresponding K1 values that
were linearly normalized for blood glucose levels. A generalized Renkin-Crone
model was used to fit FDG K1 with Rb MBF, which then allowed for a nonlinear
extraction fraction correction for converting FDG K1 to MBF. The linear
correlation between FDG-derived MBF and Rb MBF was moderate (r=0.79) before the
glucose normalization and became much improved (r>0.9) after glucose
normalization. The extraction fraction of FDG was also similar to that of
Rb-chloride in the myocardium. The results from this pilot study suggest that
dynamic cardiac FDG-PET with tracer kinetic modeling has the potential to
provide MBF in addition to its conventional use for metabolic imaging.

investigate the correlation between student performance on the set of PFI
questions and the Cognitive Reflection Test. We find that for both scores in
the FCI as a whole and in the PFI questions, the range of values of the Pearson
coefficient at 95\% confidence interval, is suggestive that cognitive
reflection may be one of the contributing factors in the student performance in
the FCI. This is consistent with the idea that high level of cognitive
reflection may help in eliminating seemingly valid choices (misconceptions) in
the FCI that are intuitive from everyday experience or ""common sense"" but
otherwise misleading. The ability to activate System 2 in Dual Process Theory,
whether from System 1 or right after reading a physics problem, may contribute
in narrowing down the set of prospective valid answers in a given physics
problem. Complementary to cognitive reflection are other factors associated
with deep understanding of physics whose effects are expected to become more
evident with the level of difficulty of a set of physics problems. Given two
students with the same level of cognitive reflection, the one with deeper
understanding of physics is more likely to get the correct answer. In our
analysis, the range of correlation coefficient for the set of PFI questions is
downshifted with respect to that for the FCI as a whole. This may be attributed

expression is complex, multimodal and fine-grained. In this paper, we propose a
novel multimodal deep learning approach to perform fine-grained emotion
recognition from real-life speeches. We design a temporal alignment mean-max
pooling mechanism to capture the subtle and fine-grained emotions implied in
every utterance. In addition, we propose a cross modality excitement module to
conduct sample-specific adjustment on cross modality embeddings and adaptively
recalibrate the corresponding values by its aligned latent features from the
other modality. Our proposed model is evaluated on two well-known real-world
speech emotion recognition datasets. The results demonstrate that our approach
is superior on the prediction tasks for multimodal speech utterances, and it
outperforms a wide range of baselines in terms of prediction accuracy. Further
more, we conduct detailed ablation studies to show that our temporal alignment
mean-max pooling mechanism and cross modality excitement significantly
contribute to the promising results. In order to encourage the research
reproducibility, we make the code publicly available at

range query on multiple REMIX-indexed data files can quickly locate the target

reconstructing scenes at several frames per second have been demonstrated,
real-time NLOS video has only been demonstrated for retro-reflective objects
where the NLOS signal strength is enhanced by 4 orders of magnitude or more.
Furthermore, it has also been noted that the signal-to-noise ratio of
reconstructions in NLOS methods drops quickly with distance and past
reconstructions, therefore, have been limited to small scenes with depths of
few meters. Actual models of noise and resolution in the scene have been
simplistic, ignoring many of the complexities of the problem. We show that SPAD

combined with a specifically extended Phasor Field reconstruction algorithm can
reconstruct live real-time videos of non-retro-reflective NLOS scenes. We
provide an analysis of the Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) of our reconstructions

SNR, motion blur, angular resolution, and depth resolution are all independent

cyclopropenylidene (c-C3H2) from high sensitivity spectroscopic observations
made with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA). Multiple
lines of cyclopropenylidene were detected in two separate datasets: ~251 GHz in
2016 (Band 6) and ~352 GHz in 2017 (Band 7). Modeling of these emissions
indicates abundances of 0.50 +/- 0.14 ppb (2016) and 0.28 +/- 0.08 (2017) for a
350 km step model, which may either signify a decrease in abundance, or a mean
value of 0.33 +/- 0.07 ppb. Inferred column abundances are (3-5)E12 cm-2 in
2016 and (1-2)E12 cm-2 in 2017, similar to photochemical model predictions.
Previously the C3H3+ ion has been measured in Titan's ionosphere by Cassini's
Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer (INMS), but the neutral (unprotonated)
species has not been detected until now, and aromatic versus aliphatic
structure could not be determined by the INMS. Our work therefore represents
the first unambiguous detection of cyclopropenylidene, the second known cyclic
molecule in Titan's atmosphere along with benzene (C6H6) and the first time
this molecule has been detected in a planetary atmosphere. We also searched for
the N-heterocycle molecules pyridine and pyrimidine finding non-detections in
both cases, and determining 2-{\sigma} upper limits of 1.15 ppb (c-C5H5N) and
0.85 ppb (c-C4H4N2) for uniform abundances above 300 km. These new results on
cyclic molecules provide fresh constraints on photochemical pathways in Titan's
atmosphere, and will require new modeling and experimental work to fully

Neptune. The planet's bulk density indicates that it has a substantial
atmosphere, so to investigate its atmospheric composition and shed further
light on its origin, we obtained {\it Spitzer} IRAC secondary eclipse
observations of LTT 9979b at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m. We combined the {\it Spitzer}
observations with a measurement of the secondary eclipse in the {\it TESS}
bandpass. The resulting secondary eclipse spectrum strongly prefers a model
that includes CO absorption over a blackbody spectrum, incidentally making LTT
9979b the first {\it TESS} exoplanet (and the first ultra-hot Neptune) with
evidence of a spectral feature in its atmosphere. We did not find evidence of a
thermal inversion, at odds with expectations based on the atmospheres of
similarly-irradiated hot Jupiters. We also report a nominal dayside brightness
temperature of 2305 $\pm$ 141 K (based on the 3.6 $\mu$m secondary eclipse

infrared phase curves, characterized using Spitzer and TESS photometry. We
detect LTT 9779b's thermal phase variations at 4.5um, finding a phase amplitude
of 358+/-106 ppm and a longitude of peak emission -10 deg +/- 21 deg east of
the substellar point. Combined with our secondary eclipse observations, these
phase curve measurements imply a 4.5um day-side brightness temperature of
1800+/-120 K, a night-side brightness temperature of 700+/-430 K (<1350 K at 2
sigma confidence), and a day-night brightness temperature contrast of

observations of hot Jupiters experiencing similar levels of stellar
irradiation. Though not conclusive, our measurement of its small 4.5um phase
offset, the relatively large amplitude of the phase variation, and the
qualitative differences between our target's day-side emission spectrum and
those of hot Jupiters of similar temperatures all suggest a super-Solar
atmospheric metallicity for LTT 9779b, as might be expected given its size and
mass. Finally, we provide a refined ephemeris (P=0.79207022+/-0.00000069 d,

their blind inference performance against such object transformations. This
training strategy successfully guides the evolution of the diffractive optical

intrinsic durations ($T_{int}$), isotropic energies of prompt gamma-rays

distributed for both the radio-loud and radio-quiet samples except those GRBs
without any radio detections. Based on the distinct distributions of $T_{int}$,
$E_{\gamma, iso}$, the circum-burst medium density ($n$) and the isotropic
equivalent energy of radio afterglows ($L_{\nu,p}$), we confirm that the GRB
radio afterglows are really better to be divided into the dim and the bright
types. However, it is noticeable that the distributions of flux densities
($F_{host}$) from host galaxies of both classes of radio afterglows are
intrinsically quite similar. Meanwhile, we point out that the radio-none sample
is also obviously different from the above two samples with radio afterglows
observed, according to the cumulative frequency distributions of the $T_{int}$

$z$. In addition, a positive correlation between $E_{\gamma, iso}$ and
$L_{\nu,p}$ is found in the radio-loud samples especially for the
supernova-associated GRBs. Besides, we also find this positive correlation in
the radio-quiet sample. A negative correlation between $T_{int}$ and $z$ is
confirmed to hold for the radio-quiet sample too. The dividing line between
short and long GRBs in the rest frame is at $T_{int}\simeq$1 s. Consequently,

requesting manufacturing services to suppliers providing those services.
Matching mechanisms i.e. allocation of clients' orders to suppliers is a key
design parameter of the marketplace platform. The platform might perform an
allocation to maximize its revenue or optimize for social welfare of all
participants. However, individual participants might not get maximum value from
their match and reject it to form matches (called blocking groups) themselves,
thereby bypassing the platform. This paper considers the bipartite matching
problem in MaaS marketplaces in a dynamic environment and proposes
approximately stable matching solutions using mechanism design and mathematical
programming approaches to limit the formation of blocking groups. Matching is
based on non-strict, incomplete and interdependent preferences of participants
over contracts enabling negotiations between both sides. Empirical simulations
are used to test the mechanisms in a simulated 3D printing marketplace and to
evaluate the impact of stability on its performance. It is found that stable
matching results in small degradation in social welfare of the marketplace.
However, it leads to a significantly better outcome in terms of stability of
allocation. Unstable matchings introduce anarchy into marketplace with
participants rejecting its allocation leading to performance poorer than stable
matchings.

creation of the first telemedicine-focused remote vital signs dataset, the
VITAL dataset. 432 videos (~864 minutes) of 54 subjects with diverse skin tones
are recorded under realistic scene conditions with corresponding vital sign

highlights and imparts unbiased performance gains across skin tones, setting
the stage for making medically inclusive non-contact HR sensing technologies a
viable reality for patients of all skin tones.

phase transitions is conceptually fascinating and of fundamental importance for
understanding phase transitions. However, it is still unclear whether or not
the quenched disorder influences the universality class of quantum phase
transitions. More crucially, the absence of superconducting-metal transitions
under in-plane magnetic fields in 2D superconductors imposes constraints on the
universality of quantum criticality. Here, we discover the tunable universality
class of superconductor-metal transition by changing the disorder strength in
$\beta$-W films with varying thickness. The finite-size scaling uncovers the
switch of universality class: quantum Griffiths singularity to multiple quantum
criticality at a critical thickness of $t_{c \perp 1}\sim 8 nm$ and then from
multiple quantum criticality to single criticality at $t_{c\perp 2}\sim 16 nm$.
Moreover, the superconducting-metal transition is observed for the first time
under in-plane magnetic fields and the universality class is changed at $t_{c
\parallel }\sim 8 nm$. The discovery of tunable universality class under both
out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields provides broad information for the
disorder effect on superconducting-metal transitions and quantum criticality.

200-MeV proton beams due to the high production rates enabled by high-intensity
beam capabilities and the greater diversity of isotope production brought on by
the long range of high-energy protons. However, nuclear reaction modeling at
these energies can be challenging because of the interplay between different
reaction modes and a lack of existing guiding cross section data. A Tri-lab
collaboration has been formed among the Lawrence Berkeley, Los Alamos, and
Brookhaven National Laboratories to address these complexities by
characterizing charged-particle nuclear reactions relevant to the production of
established and novel radioisotopes. In the inaugural collaboration
experiments, stacked-targets of niobium foils were irradiated at the Brookhaven
Linac Isotope Producer (E$_p$=200 MeV) and the Los Alamos Isotope Production
Facility (E$_p$=100 MeV) to measure $^{93}$Nb(p,x) cross sections between 50
and 200 MeV. The measured cross-section results were compared with literature
data as well as the default calculations of the nuclear model codes TALYS, CoH,
EMPIRE, and ALICE. We developed a standardized procedure that determines the
reaction model parameters that best reproduce the most prominent reaction
channels in a physically justifiable manner. The primary focus of the procedure
was to determine the best parametrization for the pre-equilibrium two-component
exciton model. This modeling study revealed a trend toward a relative decrease
for internal transition rates at intermediate proton energies (E$_p$=20-60 MeV)
in the current exciton model as compared to the default values. The results of
this work are instrumental for the planning, execution, and analysis essential
to isotope production.

supervision, i.e., only relying on the surface text of class names. This is a
more challenging setting than the seed-driven weak supervision, which allows a
few seed words per class. We opt to attack this problem from a representation
learning perspective -- ideal document representations should lead to nearly
the same results between clustering and the desired classification. In
particular, one can classify the same corpus differently (e.g., based on topics
and locations), so document representations should be adaptive to the given
class names. We propose a novel framework X-Class to realize the adaptive
representations. Specifically, we first estimate class representations by
incrementally adding the most similar word to each class until inconsistency
arises. Following a tailored mixture of class attention mechanisms, we obtain
the document representation via a weighted average of contextualized word
representations. With the prior of each document assigned to its nearest class,
we then cluster and align the documents to classes. Finally, we pick the most
confident documents from each cluster to train a text classifier. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that X-Class can rival and even outperform seed-driven
weakly supervised methods on 7 benchmark datasets. Our dataset and code are

Augmented Reality, robotics and 3D reconstruction. The state-of-the-art visual

the RANSAC framework. However, these methods require accurate pixel-level
matching at high image resolution, which is hard to satisfy under significant
changes from appearance, dynamics or perspective of view. End-to-end learning
based regression networks provide a solution to circumvent the requirement for
precise pixel-level correspondences, but demonstrate poor performance towards
cross-scene generalization. In this paper, we explicitly add a learnable
matching layer within the network to isolate the pose regression solver from
the absolute image feature values, and apply dimension regularization on both
the correlation feature channel and the image scale to further improve
performance towards generalization and large viewpoint change. We implement
this dimension regularization strategy within a two-layer pyramid based
framework to regress the localization results from coarse to fine. In addition,
the depth information is fused for absolute translational scale recovery.
Through experiments on real world RGBD datasets we validate the effectiveness
of our design in terms of improving both generalization performance and
robustness towards viewpoint change, and also show the potential of regression

difficult for geometry based visual localization methods.

existing recommender systems either increase the encoding complexity or extend
the latent representation dimension. Unfortunately, these changes inevitably
lead to increased training difficulty and exacerbate scalability issues. In
this paper, we propose a novel and efficient CF framework called Attentive
Multi-modal AutoRec (AMA) that explicitly tracks multiple facets of user

to learn user preferences with multi-modal latent representations, where each
mode captures one facet of a user's preferences. By leveraging the attention
mechanism, each observed interaction can have different contributions to the
preference facets. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets,
we show that AMA is competitive with state-of-the-art models under the OC-CF
setting. Also, we demonstrate how the proposed model improves interpretability

complex (e.g., viscoelastic) fluid environment. Analytical investigations of
such systems based on non-Markovian stochastic equations are notoriously
difficult. A common approximation is that of a single-exponential memory,
corresponding to the introduction of one auxiliary variable coupled to the
Markovian dynamics of the main variable. As a generalization, we here
investigate a class of ""toy"" models with altogether three degrees of freedom,
giving rise to more complex forms of memory. Specifically, we consider, mainly
on an analytical basis, the under- and overdamped motion of a colloidal
particle coupled linearly to two auxiliary variables, where the coupling
between variables can be either reciprocal or non-reciprocal. Projecting out
the auxiliary variables, we obtain non-Markovian Langevin equations with
friction kernels and colored noise, whose structure is similar to that of a
generalized Langevin equation. For the present systems, however, the
non-Markovian equations may violate the fluctuation-dissipation relation as
well as detailed balance, indicating that the systems are out of equilibrium.
We then study systematically the connection between the coupling topology of
the underlying Markovian system and various autocorrelation functions.We
demonstrate that already two auxiliary variables can generate surprisingly
complex (e.g., non-monotonic or oscillatory) memory and correlation functions.
Finally, we show that a minimal overdamped model with two auxiliary variables

divergence between data and model distributions can be computed and optimized
efficiently, requiring no expensive sampling or adversarial training. Compared
to previous score matching algorithms, our method is more scalable to high
dimensional data and more stable to optimize. We show with extensive

graph structure and node features carry important information. Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) provide an expressive way to fuse information from network
structure and node features. However, GNNs are prone to adversarial attacks.
Here we introduce Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB), an information-theoretic
principle that optimally balances expressiveness and robustness of the learned
representation of graph-structured data. Inheriting from the general
Information Bottleneck (IB), GIB aims to learn the minimal sufficient
representation for a given task by maximizing the mutual information between
the representation and the target, and simultaneously constraining the mutual
information between the representation and the input data. Different from the
general IB, GIB regularizes the structural as well as the feature information.
We design two sampling algorithms for structural regularization and instantiate
the GIB principle with two new models: GIB-Cat and GIB-Bern, and demonstrate
the benefits by evaluating the resilience to adversarial attacks. We show that
our proposed models are more robust than state-of-the-art graph defense models.
GIB-based models empirically achieve up to 31% improvement with adversarial

variability of the features. For this latter purpose, we also propose and

We use a mathematical model combining human mobility and disease spreading. For
the mobility dynamics, we design an agent based model consisting of pedestrian
dynamics with a novel type of force to resemble social distancing in crowded
sites. For the spreading dynamics, we consider the compartmental SIE dynamics
plus an indirect transmission with the footprints of the infectious pedestrians
being the contagion factor. We show that the increase in the intensity of
social distancing has a significant effect on the exposure risk. By classifying
the population into social distancing abiders and non-abiders, we conclude that
the practice of social distancing, even by a minority of potentially infectious
agents, results in a drastic change on the population exposure risk, but
reduces the effectiveness of the protocols when practiced by the rest of the
population. Furthermore, we observe that for contagions which the indirect
transmission is more significant, the effectiveness of social distancing would
be reduced. This study can provide a quantitative guideline for policy-making
on exposure risk reduction.

counterfactual goal generation at turn-level by dropping and adding slots
followed by replacing slot values, (ii) counterfactual conversation generation
that is conditioned on (i) and consistent with the dialogue flow. Evaluating
state-of-the-art DST models on MultiWOZ dataset with CoCo-generated
counterfactuals results in a significant performance drop of up to 30.8% (from
49.4% to 18.6%) in absolute joint goal accuracy. In comparison, widely used

evaluations show that COCO-generated conversations perfectly reflect the

original conversations, further strengthening its reliability and promise to be

co-axial cylinders is commonly used as a canonical model for shear flows.
Unlike plane Couette, pinned secondary flows can be found in TC flow. These are
known as Taylor rolls and drastically affect the flow behaviour. We study the
possibility of modifying these secondary structures using patterns of
stress-free and no-slip boundary conditions on the inner cylinder. For this, we
perform direct numerical simulations of narrow-gap TC flow with pure inner
cylinder rotation at four different shear Reynolds numbers up to $Re_s=3\times
10^4$. We find that one-dimensional azimuthal patterns do not have a
significant effect on the flow topology, and that the resulting torque is a
large fraction ($\sim80-90\%$) of torque in the fully no-slip case.
One-dimensional axial patterns decrease the torque more, and for certain
pattern frequency disrupt the rolls by interfering with the existing Reynolds
stresses that generate secondary structures. For $Re\geq 10^4$, this disruption
leads to a smaller torque than what would be expected from simple boundary
layer effects and the resulting effective slip length and slip velocity. We
find that two-dimensional checkerboard patterns have similar behaviour to
azimuthal patterns and do not affect the flow or the torque substantially, but
two-dimensional spiral inhomogeneities can move around the pinned secondary
flows as they induce persistent axial velocities. We quantify the roll's
movement for various angles and the widths of the spiral pattern, and find a
non-monotonic behaviour as a function of pattern angle and pattern frequency.

safeguard 100% of the devices with state-of-the-art security countermeasures.
Hence, large-scale IoT has inevitable loopholes for network intrusion and
malware infiltration. Even worse, exploiting the high density of devices and
direct wireless connectivity, malware infection can stealthily propagate
through susceptible (i.e., unsecured) devices and form an epidemic outbreak
without being noticed to security administration. A malware outbreak enables
adversaries to compromise large population of devices, which can be exploited
to launch versatile cyber and physical malicious attacks. In this context, we
utilize spatial firewalls, to safeguard the IoT from malware outbreak. In
particular, spatial firewalls are computationally capable devices equipped with
state-of-the-art security and anti-malware programs that are spatially deployed
across the network to filter the wireless traffic in order to detect and thwart
malware propagation. Using tools from percolation theory, we prove that there
exists a critical density of spatial firewalls beyond which malware outbreak is
impossible. This, in turns, safeguards the IoT from malware epidemics
regardless of the infection/treatment rates. To this end, a tractable upper
bound for the critical density of spatial firewalls is obtained. Furthermore,
we characterize the relative communications ranges of the spatial firewalls and

innermost stable circular orbits (ISCOs) of the particle increases with the
increase of the MOG parameter, while the increase of cyclotron frequency being
responsible to the magnetic interaction causes the decrease of the latter.
Moreover, the dynamics of magnetic dipoles has shown that the increase of the

techniques' unique features. This paper presents ExPAN(N)D, a framework to
analyze and ingather the efficacy of the Posit number representation scheme and
the efficiency of fixed-point arithmetic implementations for ANNs. The Posit
scheme offers a better dynamic range and higher precision for various
applications than IEEE $754$ single-precision floating-point format. However,
due to the dynamic nature of the various fields of the Posit scheme, the
corresponding arithmetic circuits have higher critical path delay and resource
requirements than the single-precision-based arithmetic units. Towards this
end, we propose a novel Posit to fixed-point converter for enabling
high-performance and energy-efficient hardware implementations for ANNs with
minimal drop in the output accuracy. We also propose a modified Posit-based
representation to store the trained parameters of a network. Compared to an
$8$-bit fixed-point-based inference accelerator, our proposed implementation
offers $\approx46\%$ and $\approx18\%$ reductions in the storage requirements
of the parameters and energy consumption of the MAC units, respectively.

maximum cooling power of the absorption refrigerator is not limited just by the
maximum power of the internal refrigerator but, due to the first law, also by
that of the internal engine. As a specific example, we consider the
simultaneous absorption refrigerators composed of low-dissipation (LD) heat
engines and refrigerators, for which the expressions for MEGPs are known. The
derived expression for maximum efficiency implies bounds on the MEGP of LD
absorption refrigerators. It also implies that a slight decrease in power of
the absorption refrigerator from its maximum value results in a large nonlinear
increase in efficiency observed in heat engines whenever the ratio of maximum
powers of the internal engine and the refrigerator does not diverge. Otherwise,
the increase in efficiency is linear as observed in LD refrigerators. Thus, in
all practical situations, the efficiency of LD absorption refrigerators
significantly increases when their cooling power is slightly decreased from its
maximum.

adversarial attacks using such adversarial examples could cause serious

varies depending on different factors, including genetics, age, social
functioning, cognitive functioning, and so on. Analysis of these variations in
visual attention has already elicited two potential research avenues: 1)
determining the physiological or psychological state of the subject and 2)
predicting the tasks associated with the act of viewing from the recorded
eye-fixation data. To this end, this paper proposes a visual saliency based
novel feature extraction method for automatic and quantitative classification
of eye-tracking data, which is applicable to both of the research directions.
Instead of directly extracting features from the fixation data, this method
employs several well-known computational models of visual attention to predict
eye fixation locations as saliency maps. Comparing the saliency amplitudes,
similarity and dissimilarity of saliency maps with the corresponding eye
fixations maps gives an extra dimension of information which is effectively
utilized to generate discriminative features to classify the eye-tracking data.
Extensive experimentation using Saliency4ASD, Age Prediction, and Visual
Perceptual Task dataset show that our saliency-based feature can achieve
superior performance, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art methods by a
considerable margin. Moreover, unlike the existing application-specific
solutions, our method demonstrates performance improvement across three
distinct problems from the real-life domain: Autism Spectrum Disorder
screening, toddler age prediction, and human visual perceptual task

extra-information inherent in saliency maps for a more accurate classification.

efficiency compared with model-free reinforcement learning (MFRL). However,
MBRL is plagued by dynamics bottleneck dilemma. Dynamics bottleneck dilemma is
the phenomenon that the performance of the algorithm falls into the local
optimum instead of increasing when the interaction step with the environment
increases, which means more data can not bring better performance. In this
paper, we find that the trajectory reward estimation error is the main reason
that causes dynamics bottleneck dilemma through theoretical analysis. We give
an upper bound of the trajectory reward estimation error and point out that
increasing the agent's exploration ability is the key to reduce trajectory
reward estimation error, thereby alleviating dynamics bottleneck dilemma.
Motivated by this, a model-based control method combined with exploration named
MOdel-based Progressive Entropy-based Exploration (MOPE2) is proposed. We
conduct experiments on several complex continuous control benchmark tasks. The
results verify that MOPE2 can effectively alleviate dynamics bottleneck dilemma

it answers the related text for the given question through text semantic

\mathcal{F} \mapsto (0,1)$, the problem of sampling seeks to sample an item
proportional to its weight. Sampling is a fundamental problem in machine
learning. The daunting computational complexity of sampling with formal
guarantees leads designers to propose heuristics-based techniques for which no
rigorous theoretical analysis exists to quantify the quality of generated
distributions.
  This poses a challenge in designing a testing methodology to test whether a
sampler under test generates samples according to a given distribution. Only
recently, Chakraborty and Meel (2019) designed the first scalable verifier,
called Barbarik1, for samplers in the special case when the weight function
$\mathtt{wt}$ is constant, that is, when the sampler is supposed to sample
uniformly from $\mathcal{F}$ . The techniques in Barbarik1, however, fail to
handle general weight functions.
  The primary contribution of this paper is an affirmative answer to the above
challenge: motivated by Barbarik1 but using different techniques and analysis,
we design Barbarik2 an algorithm to test whether the distribution generated by
a sampler is $\varepsilon$-close or $\eta$-far from any target distribution. In
contrast to black-box sampling techniques that require a number of samples
proportional to $|\mathcal{F}|$ , Barbarik2 requires only
$\tilde{O}(tilt(\mathtt{wt},\varphi)^2/\eta(\eta - 6\varepsilon)^3)$ samples,
where the $tilt$ is the maximum ratio of weights of two satisfying assignments.
Barbarik2 can handle any arbitrary weight function. We present a prototype
implementation of Barbarik2 and use it to test three state-of-the-art samplers.

leverages (1) distant supervision to improve the quality of noisy proxies, and

state-of-the-art method for hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration, which

Unfortunately, while its restoration performance benefits from more spectral
bands, its runtime also substantially increases. In this paper, we claim that
the HSI lies in a global spectral low-rank subspace, and the spectral subspaces
of each full band patch group should lie in this global low-rank subspace. This
motivates us to propose a unified paradigm combining the spatial and spectral
properties for HSI restoration. The proposed paradigm enjoys performance
superiority from the non-local spatial denoising and light computation
complexity from the low-rank orthogonal basis exploration. An efficient
alternating minimization algorithm with rank adaptation is developed. It is
done by first solving a fidelity term-related problem for the update of a
latent input image, and then learning a low-dimensional orthogonal basis and
the related reduced image from the latent input image. Subsequently, non-local
low-rank denoising is developed to refine the reduced image and orthogonal
basis iteratively. Finally, the experiments on HSI denoising, compressed
reconstruction, and inpainting tasks, with both simulated and real datasets,
demonstrate its superiority with respect to state-of-the-art HSI restoration

sequence. We focus on the evaluation of the activity properties of stars that
could be analogs of the young Sun. Our study includes joint consideration of
different tracers of activity, rotation and magnetic fields of Sun-like stars
of various ages. We identify rotation periods, when the saturated regime of
activity changes to the unsaturated mode, when the solar-type activity is
formed: for G- and K-type stars, they are 1.1 and 3.3 days, respectively. This
corresponds to an age interval of about 0.2-0.6 Gyr, when regular sunspot cycle
began to be established on the early Sun. We discuss properties of the coronal
and chromospheric activity in young Suns. Our evaluation of the EUV-fluxes in
the spectral range of 1350-1750 A shows that the far-UV radiation of the early
Sun was a factor of 7 times more intense than that of the present-day Sun, and
twice higher when the regular sunspot cycle was established. For the young Sun,
we can estimate the possible mass loss rate associated with quasi-steady
outflow as $10^{-12} M_\odot$/yr. The results of observations of the largest
flares on solar-type stars are also discussed, leading to conclusion that the
most powerful phenomena occur on the fast-rotating stars in the saturated
activity regime. Our estimate of the stellar magnetic fields makes it possible
to evaluate the maximal possible flare energy. This could help us better
understand the origin of extreme events on the Sun in the past.

which has not been well-studied in existing works. Here, we propose an approach
to learning a compact view-invariant embedding space from 2D body joint
keypoints, without explicitly predicting 3D poses. Input ambiguities of 2D
poses from projection and occlusion are difficult to represent through a
deterministic mapping, and therefore we adopt a probabilistic formulation for
our embedding space. Experimental results show that our embedding model
achieves higher accuracy when retrieving similar poses across different camera
views, in comparison with 3D pose estimation models. We also show that by
training a simple temporal embedding model, we achieve superior performance on
pose sequence retrieval and largely reduce the embedding dimension from
stacking frame-based embeddings for efficient large-scale retrieval.
Furthermore, in order to enable our embeddings to work with partially visible
input, we further investigate different keypoint occlusion augmentation
strategies during training. We demonstrate that these occlusion augmentations
significantly improve retrieval performance on partial 2D input poses. Results
on action recognition and video alignment demonstrate that using our embeddings
without any additional training achieves competitive performance relative to
other models specifically trained for each task.

first give a tutorial presentation of the EM algorithm for estimating the
parameters of a $K$-component mixture density. The Gaussian mixture case is
presented in detail using $K$-ary scalar hidden (or latent) variables rather
than the more traditional binary valued $K$-dimenional vectors. This
presentation is motivated by mixture modelling from the target tracking
literature. In a similar style to Bishop's 2009 book, we present variational
Bayesian inference as a generalised EM algorithm stemming from the variational
(or evidential) lower bound, as well as the technique of mean field
approximation (or product density transform). We continue the evolution from EM
to variational autoencoders, developed by Kingma & Welling in 2014. In so
doing, we establish clear links between the EM algorithm and its variational
counterparts, hence clarifying the meaning of ""latent variables."" We provide a
detailed coverage of the ""reparametrisation trick"" and focus on how the AEVB
differs from conventional variational Bayesian inference. Throughout the

Quantum programming tasks are prepared in line with the content. Pre/post-test
design method and Likert scale satisfaction surveys are utilized to measure
knowledge acquisition and to evaluate the perception of the learning process by
the participants.
  Findings: Conducted pre/post-test design survey shows that there is a
statistically significant increase in the basic knowledge levels of the
participants on quantum computing concepts. Furthermore, no significant
difference in the gain scores is observed between the participants from
different STEM-related educational backgrounds. The majority of the
participants were satisfied and provided positive feedback.

to resolve the primordial lithium abundance problem. The value of the ratio of
$7Li$ to hydrogen $7Li/H=1.400(\pm 0.023){\times}10^{-10}$ we have calculated
using this approach is about four times lower than that estimated using the
standard lambda cold dark matter (${\Lambda}$CDM) cosmological model, and is
consistent with the most agreed observational value of $1.6(\pm
0.3){\times}10^{-10}$. In the VPC approach Einstein equations are modified to
include the variation of the speed of light $c$, gravitational constant $G$ and
cosmological constant ${\Lambda}$ using the Einstein-Hilbert action.
Application of this approach to cosmology naturally leads to the variation of
the Plank constant $\hbar$ and the Boltzmann constant $k_B$ as well. They
approach fixed values at the scale factor $a\ll 1$: $c=c_0/e$, $G=G_0/e^3$,
$\hbar=\hbar_0/e$ and $k_B=k_{B0}/e^{5/4}$, where $e$ is the Euler's number
(=2.7183). Since the VPC cosmology reduces to the same form as the
${\Lambda}$CDM cosmology at very small scale factors, we could use an existing
Big-Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) code AlterBBN with the above changes to
calculate the light element abundances under the VPC cosmology. Among other
abundances we have calculated at baryon to photon ratio

effectively in the past by Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), by virtue of 2
important characteristics: (a) The use of a representation language that easily
captures the relation encoded in graph-structured data, and (b) The inclusion
of prior information encoded as domain-specific relations, that can alleviate
problems of data scarcity, and construct new relations. Recent advances have
seen the emergence of deep neural networks specifically developed for
graph-structured data (Graph-based Neural Networks, or GNNs). While GNNs have
been shown to be able to handle graph-structured data, less has been done to
investigate the inclusion of domain-knowledge. Here we investigate this aspect
of GNNs empirically by employing an operation we term ""vertex-enrichment"" and
denote the corresponding GNNs as ""VEGNNs"". Using over 70 real-world datasets
and substantial amounts of symbolic domain-knowledge, we examine the result of
vertex-enrichment across 5 different variants of GNNs. Our results provide
support for the following: (a) Inclusion of domain-knowledge by
vertex-enrichment can significantly improve the performance of a GNN. That is,
the performance VEGNNs is significantly better than GNNs across all GNN
variants; (b) The inclusion of domain-specific relations constructed using ILP
improves the performance of VEGNNs, across all GNN variants. Taken together,
the results provide evidence that it is possible to incorporate symbolic domain
knowledge into a GNN, and that ILP can play an important role in providing
high-level relationships that are not easily discovered by a GNN.

non-parametric inference for problems such as unconditional and conditional
density estimation due to their unique hierarchical structure that models the

recently, transformation-based models have been used in variational inference
(VI) to construct flexible implicit families of variational distributions.
However, their use in both non-parametric inference and variational inference
lacks theoretical justification. We provide theoretical justification for the

the flexibility demonstrated in the non-parametric setting, we use the NL-LVM
to construct an implicit family of variational distributions, deemed GP-IVI. We
delineate sufficient conditions under which GP-IVI achieves optimal risk bounds

networks called typed graphlets. Informally, typed graphlets are small typed
induced subgraphs. Typed graphlets generalize graphlets to rich heterogeneous
networks as they explicitly capture the higher-order typed connectivity
patterns in such networks. To address this problem, we describe a general
framework for counting the occurrences of such typed graphlets. The proposed
algorithms leverage a number of combinatorial relationships for different typed
graphlets. For each edge, we count a few typed graphlets, and with these counts
along with the combinatorial relationships, we obtain the exact counts of the
other typed graphlets in o(1) constant time. Notably, the worst-case time
complexity of the proposed approach matches the time complexity of the best
known untyped algorithm. In addition, the approach lends itself to an efficient
lock-free and asynchronous parallel implementation. While there are no existing
methods for typed graphlets, there has been some work that focused on computing
a different and much simpler notion called colored graphlet. The experiments
confirm that our proposed approach is orders of magnitude faster and more
space-efficient than methods for computing the simpler notion of colored
graphlet. Unlike these methods that take hours on small networks, the proposed
approach takes only seconds on large networks with millions of edges. Notably,
since typed graphlet is more general than colored graphlet (and untyped
graphlets), the counts of various typed graphlets can be combined to obtain the
counts of the much simpler notion of colored graphlets. The proposed methods
give rise to new opportunities and applications for typed graphlets.

matrix pole expansions for complex wavenumbers in R-matrix theory. In the past,
two branches of theoretical formalisms emerged to describe the scattering
matrix in nuclear physics: R-matrix theory, and pole expansions. The two have
been quite isolated from one another. Recently, our study of Brune's
alternative parametrization of R-matrix theory has shown the need to extend the
scattering matrix (and the underlying R-matrix operators) to complex
wavenumbers. Two competing ways of doing so have emerged from a historical
ambiguity in the definitions of the shift $\boldsymbol{S}$ and penetration
$\boldsymbol{P}$ functions: the legacy Lane \& Thomas ""force closure"" approach,
versus analytic continuation (which is the standard in mathematical physics).
The R-matrix community has not yet come to a consensus as to which to adopt for
evaluations in standard nuclear data libraries, such as ENDF.
  In this article, we argue in favor of analytic continuation of R-matrix
operators. We bridge R-matrix theory with the Humblet-Rosenfeld pole
expansions, and unveil new properties of the Siegert-Humblet radioactive poles
and widths, including their invariance properties to changes in channel radii
$a_c$. We then show that analytic continuation of R-matrix operators preserves
important physical and mathematical properties of the scattering matrix --
cancelling spurious poles and guaranteeing generalized unitarity -- while still
being able to close channels below thresholds.

knowledge graph (KG), is an essential step in KG embedding. Recently,
generative adversarial network (GAN), has been introduced in negative sampling.
By sampling negative triplets with large gradients, these methods avoid the
problem of vanishing gradient and thus obtain better performance. However, they
make the original model more complex and harder to train. In this paper,
motivated by the observation that negative triplets with large gradients are
important but rare, we propose to directly keep track of them with the cache.
In this way, our method acts as a ""distilled"" version of previous GAN-based
methods, which does not waste training time on additional parameters to fit the
full distribution of negative triplets. However, how to sample from and update
the cache are two critical questions. We propose to solve these issues by
automated machine learning techniques. The automated version also covers
GAN-based methods as special cases. Theoretical explanation of NSCaching is
also provided, justifying the superior over fixed sampling scheme. Besides, we
further extend NSCaching with skip-gram model for graph embedding. Finally,
extensive experiments show that our method can gain significant improvements on
various KG embedding models and the skip-gram model, and outperforms the

particular, emphasize the role of the initial distribution of infected patches
in the network, on the progression of an endemic and initiation of a recovery
process, if any, due to migration of both the susceptible and infected hosts.
The disease starts in the lattice with three possible initial distribution
patterns of infected and infection-free sites, infected core patches (ICP),
infected peripheral patches (IPP) and randomly distributed infected patches
(RDIP). Our results show that infection spreads monotonically in the lattice
with increasing migration without showing any sign of recovery in the ICP case.
In the IPP case, it follows a similar monotonic progression with increasing
migration, however, a self-organized healing process starts for higher
migration, leading the lattice to full recovery at a critical rate of
migration. Encouragingly, for the initial RDIP arrangement, chances of recovery
are much higher with a lower rate of critical migration. An eigenvalue based
semi-analytical study is made to determine the critical migration rate for
realizing a stable infection-free lattice. The initial fraction of infected
patches and the force of infection play significant roles in the self-organized
recovery. They follow an exponential law, for the RDIP case, that governs the
recovery process. For the frustrating case of ICP arrangement, we propose a
random rewiring of links in the lattice allowing long-distance migratory paths
that effectively initiate a recovery process. Global prevalence of infection
thereby declines and progressively improves with the rewiring probability that
follows a power law with the critical migration and leads to the birth of
emergent infection-free networks.

decouples the modeling of marginals from the dependencies between them.
Gaussian Mixture Copula Model (GMCM) is a highly flexible copula that can model
many kinds of multi-modal dependencies, as well as asymmetric and tail
dependencies. They have been effectively used in clustering non-Gaussian data
and in Reproducibility Analysis, a meta-analysis method designed to verify the
reliability and consistency of multiple high-throughput experiments. Parameter
estimation for GMCM is challenging due to its intractable likelihood. The best
previous methods have maximized a proxy-likelihood through a Pseudo Expectation
Maximization (PEM) algorithm. They have no guarantees of convergence or
convergence to the correct parameters. In this paper, we use Automatic
Differentiation (AD) tools to develop a method, called AD-GMCM, that can
maximize the exact GMCM likelihood. In our simulation studies and experiments
with real data, AD-GMCM finds more accurate parameter estimates than PEM and
yields better performance in clustering and Reproducibility Analysis. We
discuss the advantages of an AD-based approach, to address problems related to
monotonic increase of likelihood and parameter identifiability in GMCM. We also
analyze, for GMCM, two well-known cases of degeneracy of maximum likelihood in
GMM that can lead to spurious clustering solutions. Our analysis shows that,
unlike GMM, GMCM is not affected in one of the cases.

implicit multi-hop reasoning. As an approach to OpenCSR, we propose DrFact, an
efficient Differentiable model for multi-hop Reasoning over knowledge Facts. To

only partially known, the vertex nomination problem seeks to rank the remaining
vertices in such a way that the interesting vertices are ranked at the top of
the list. An important variant of this problem is vertex nomination in the
multi-graphs setting. Given two graphs $G_1, G_2$ with common vertices and a
vertex of interest $x \in G_1$, we wish to rank the vertices of $G_2$ such that
the vertices most similar to $x$ are ranked at the top of the list. The current
paper addresses this problem and proposes a method that first applies adjacency
spectral graph embedding to embed the graphs into a common Euclidean space, and
then solves a penalized linear assignment problem to obtain the nomination
lists. Since the spectral embedding of the graphs are only unique up to
orthogonal transformations, we present two approaches to eliminate this
potential non-identifiability. One approach is based on orthogonal Procrustes
and is applicable when there are enough vertices with known correspondence
between the two graphs. Another approach uses adaptive point set registration
and is applicable when there are few or no vertices with known correspondence.
We show that our nomination scheme leads to accurate nomination under a
generative model for pairs of random graphs that are approximately low-rank and
possibly with pairwise edge correlations. We illustrate our algorithm's
performance through simulation studies on synthetic data as well as analysis of
a high-school friendship network and analysis of transition rates between web

have prompted most conference organizers to move their events online. However,
in contrast to physical conferences, virtual conferences face a challenge in
efficiently scheduling talks, accounting for the availability of participants
from different time-zones as well as their interests in attending different
talks. In such settings, a natural objective for the conference organizers
would be to maximize some global welfare measure, such as the total expected
audience participation across all talks. However, we show that optimizing for
global welfare could result in a schedule that is unfair to the stakeholders,
i.e., the individual utilities for participants and speakers can be highly
unequal. To address the fairness concerns, we formally define fairness notions
for participants and speakers, and subsequently derive suitable fairness
objectives for them. We show that the welfare and fairness objectives can be in
conflict with each other, and there is a need to maintain a balance between
these objective while caring for them simultaneously. Thus, we propose a joint
optimization framework that allows conference organizers to design talk
schedules that balance (i.e., allow trade-offs) between global welfare,
participant fairness and the speaker fairness objectives. We show that the
optimization problem can be solved using integer linear programming, and
empirically evaluate the necessity and benefits of such joint optimization
approach in virtual conference scheduling.

set of common features for all subjects in each site. It then uses TL to map
these site-specific features to a site-independent shared space in order to
improve the performance of the MVPA. SSTL uses a scalable optimization
procedure that works effectively for high-dimensional fMRI datasets. The
optimization procedure extracts the common features for each site by using a
single-iteration algorithm and maps these site-specific common features to the
site-independent shared space. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed

generalization and an extension of WGCNA. It aims to identify specific modules
of overlapping communities underlying the co-expression network of genes.
Module detection is achieved by using Hierarchical Link Clustering. The
overlapping nature of the systems' regulatory domains that generate
co-expression can be identified by such modules. LASSO regression is employed
to analyze phenotypic responses of modules to treatment.
  Results. The workflow is applied to rice (Oryza sativa), a major food source
known to be highly sensitive to salt stress. The workflow identifies 19 rice
genes that seem relevant in the response to salt stress. They are distributed
across 6 modules: 3 modules, each grouping together 3 genes, are associated to
shoot K content; 2 modules of 3 genes are associated to shoot biomass; and 1
module of 4 genes is associated to root biomass. These genes represent target
genes for the improvement of salinity tolerance in rice.
  Conclusion. A more effective framework to reduce the search-space for target
genes that respond to a specific treatment is introduced. It facilitates
experimental validation by restraining efforts to a smaller subset of genes of
high potential relevance.

  as Latent Variables","NeurIPS 2020. The first three authors contribute equally",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recently generating natural language explanations has shown very promising
results in not only offering interpretable explanations but also providing
additional information and supervision for prediction. However, existing
approaches usually require a large set of human annotated explanations for
training while collecting a large set of explanations is not only time
consuming but also expensive. In this paper, we develop a general framework for
interpretable natural language understanding that requires only a small set of
human annotated explanations for training. Our framework treats natural
language explanations as latent variables that model the underlying reasoning
process of a neural model. We develop a variational EM framework for
optimization where an explanation generation module and an
explanation-augmented prediction module are alternatively optimized and
mutually enhance each other. Moreover, we further propose an explanation-based
self-training method under this framework for semi-supervised learning. It
alternates between assigning pseudo-labels to unlabeled data and generating new
explanations to iteratively improve each other. Experiments on two natural
language understanding tasks demonstrate that our framework can not only make
effective predictions in both supervised and semi-supervised settings, but also
generate good natural language explanation.

Code and Data: https://github.com/INK-USC/CALM/",,,,"cs.CL cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pre-trained language models (PTLM) have achieved impressive results in a
range of natural language understanding (NLU) and generation (NLG) tasks.
However, current pre-training objectives such as masked token prediction (for
BERT-style PTLMs) and masked span infilling (for T5-style PTLMs) do not
explicitly model the relational commonsense knowledge about everyday concepts,
which is crucial to many downstream tasks that need common sense to understand
or generate. To augment PTLMs with concept-centric commonsense knowledge, in
this paper, we propose both generative and contrastive objectives for learning
common sense from the text, and use them as intermediate self-supervised
learning tasks for incrementally pre-training PTLMs (before task-specific
fine-tuning on downstream datasets). Furthermore, we develop a joint
pre-training framework to unify generative and contrastive objectives so that
they can mutually reinforce each other. Extensive experimental results show
that our method, concept-aware language model (CALM), can pack more commonsense
knowledge into the parameters of a pre-trained text-to-text transformer without
relying on external knowledge graphs, yielding better performance on both NLU
and NLG tasks. We show that while only incrementally pre-trained on a
relatively small corpus for a few steps, CALM outperforms baseline methods by a
consistent margin and even comparable with some larger PTLMs, which suggests
that CALM can serve as a general, plug-and-play method for improving the
commonsense reasoning ability of a PTLM.

resected using surgical tools. Usually the procedures and the treated or
resected areas are not specifically tracked or analysed during or after
colonoscopies. Information regarding disease borders, development and amount
and size of the resected area get lost. This can lead to poor follow-up and
bothersome reassessment difficulties post-treatment. To improve the current
standard and also to foster more research on the topic we have released the
``Kvasir-Instrument'' dataset which consists of $590$ annotated frames
containing GI procedure tools such as snares, balloons and biopsy forceps, etc.
Beside of the images, the dataset includes ground truth masks and bounding
boxes and has been verified by two expert GI endoscopists. Additionally, we
provide a baseline for the segmentation of the GI tools to promote research and
algorithm development. We obtained a dice coefficient score of 0.9158 and a
Jaccard index of 0.8578 using a classical U-Net architecture. A similar dice
coefficient score was observed for DoubleUNet. The qualitative results showed
that the model did not work for the images with specularity and the frames with
multiple instruments, while the best result for both methods was observed on
all other types of images. Both, qualitative and quantitative results show that
the model performs reasonably good, but there is a large potential for further
improvements. Benchmarking using the dataset provides an opportunity for
researchers to contribute to the field of automatic endoscopic diagnostic and
therapeutic tool segmentation for GI endoscopy.

  2021 (Long Paper) v1: preprint",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Generative models for dialog systems have gained much interest because of the
recent success of RNN and Transformer based models in tasks like question
answering and summarization. Although the task of dialog response generation is
generally seen as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) problem, researchers in the
past have found it challenging to train dialog systems using the standard
Seq2Seq models. Therefore, to help the model learn meaningful utterance and
conversation level features, Sordoni et al. (2015b); Serban et al. (2016)
proposed Hierarchical RNN architecture, which was later adopted by several
other RNN based dialog systems. With the transformer-based models dominating
the seq2seq problems lately, the natural question to ask is the applicability
of the notion of hierarchy in transformer based dialog systems. In this paper,
we propose a generalized framework for Hierarchical Transformer Encoders and
show how a standard transformer can be morphed into any hierarchical encoder,
including HRED and HIBERT like models, by using specially designed attention
masks and positional encodings. We demonstrate that Hierarchical Encoding helps
achieve better natural language understanding of the contexts in
transformer-based models for task-oriented dialog systems through a wide range
of experiments.
