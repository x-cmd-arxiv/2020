of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). However, GAN-based approaches mostly
generate photo-realistic results as long as the testing data distribution is
close to the training data distribution. The quality of GAN results
significantly degrades when testing images are from a slightly different
distribution. Moreover, recent work has shown that facial expressions can be
synthesized by changing localized face regions. In this work, we propose a
pixel-based facial expression synthesis method in which each output pixel
observes only one input pixel. The proposed method achieves good generalization
capability by leveraging only a few hundred training images. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed method performs comparably well against
state-of-the-art GANs on in-dataset images and significantly better on
out-of-dataset images. In addition, the proposed model is two orders of
magnitude smaller which makes it suitable for deployment on
resource-constrained devices.

iodide perovskite nanoplatelets via differential transmission spectroscopy. We
find that the cooling of excited electron-hole pairs by phonon emission
progresses much faster and is intensity-independent in the 2D-case. This is due
to the low dielectric surrounding of the thin perovskite layers, for which the
Fr\""ohlich interaction is screened less efficiently leading to higher and less
density dependent carrier-phonon scattering rates. In addition, rapid
dissipation of heat into the surrounding occurs due to the high
surface-to-volume ratio. Furthermore, we observe a sub-picosecond dissociation
of resonantly excited 1s excitons in the quasi-3D case, an effect which is
suppressed in the 2D nanoplatelets due to their large exciton binding energies.
The results highlight the importance of the surrounding environment of the
inorganic nanoplatelets on their relaxation dynamics. Moreover, this 2D
material with relaxation times in the sub-picosecond regime shows great
potential for realizing devices such as photodetectors or all-optical switches

reveal a blueshift with increasing chain length n including a jump of 110 meV

Results of effective mass approximation model calculations show good agreement

octahedral tilting plays a major role in determining the optical bandgap and
suggests that miniband formation plays only a minor role in this material.

become a standard technique for energy and force predictions using
high-dimensional neural network potentials (HDNNP). Established atom-centred
SFs, however, are limited in their flexibility, since their functional form
restricts the angular domain that can be sampled. Here, we introduce a class of
atom-centred symmetry functions based on polynomials with compact support
called polynomial symmetry functions (PSF), which enable a free choice of both,
the angular and the radial domain covered. We demonstrate that the accuracy of
PSFs is either on par or considerably better than that of conventional,
atom-centred SFs, with reductions in force prediction errors over a test set
approaching 50% for certain organic molecules. Contrary to established
atom-centred SFs, computation of PSF does not involve any exponentials, and
their intrinsic compact support supersedes use of separate cutoff functions.
Most importantly, the number of floating point operations required to compute
polynomial SFs introduced here is considerably lower than that of other SFs,
enabling their efficient implementation without the need of highly optimised
code structures or caching, with speedups with respect to other
state-of-the-art SFs reaching a factor of 4.5 to 5. This low-effort performance
benefit substantially simplifies their use in new programs and emerging
platforms such as graphical processing units (GPU). Overall, polynomial SFs
with compact support improve accuracy of both, energy and force predictions
with HDNNPs while enabling significant speedups with respect to their
well-established counterparts.

needed. The METIS library is leveraged to perform a domain decomposition on the
2D unstructured triangular meshes of interest. A CUDA-Aware OpenMPI version is
adopted to speed up the messages between the MPI processes. A study of both
speed-up and efficiency is conducted; first, for a classic dam-break flow in a
canal, and then for two real domains with complex bathymetries: the Mille
\^Iles river and the Montreal archipelago. In both cases, meshes with up to 13
million cells are used. Using 24 to 28 GPUs on these meshes leads to an
efficiency of 80% and more. Finally, the multi-GPU version is compared to the
pure MPI multi-CPU version, and it is concluded that in this particular case,
about 100 CPU cores would be needed to achieve the same performance as one GPU.

many commercial solutions currently available. In such solutions, the cloud
storage is trusted for data availability, but not for confidentiality.
Additionally, the user's device is considered secure, and the user is expected
to behave correctly.
  We argue that such assumptions are not met in reality: e.g., users routinely
forget passwords and fail to make backups, and users' devices get stolen or
become infected with malware. Therefore, we consider a more extensive threat
model, where users' devices are susceptible to attacks and common human errors
are possible. Given this model, we analyze 10 popular commercial services and
show that none of them provides good confidentiality and data availability.
  Motivated by the lack of adequate solutions in the market, we design a novel
scheme called Two-Factor Encryption (2FE) that draws inspiration from
two-factor authentication and turns file encryption and decryption into an
interactive process where two user devices, like a laptop and a smartphone,
must interact. 2FE provides strong confidentiality and availability guarantees,
as it withstands compromised cloud storage, one stolen or compromised user
device at a time, and various human errors. 2FE achieves this by leveraging
secret sharing with additional techniques such as oblivious pseudorandom
functions and zero-knowledge proofs. We evaluate 2FE experimentally and show
that its performance overhead is small. Finally, we explain how our approach
can be adapted to other related use cases such as cryptocurrency wallets.

to obtain a catalog of young stellar groups (YSGs) in the galaxy NGC 2403. We
studied the internal distribution of stars in these YSGs using the Q parameter.
We extended these analyses to the YSGs detected in in NGC 300 and NGC 253 our
previous works. We built the young stars' density maps for these three
galaxies. Through these maps, we were able to identify and study young stellar
structures on larger scales.
  Results: We found 573 YSGs in the galaxy NGC 2403, for which we derived their
individual sizes, densities, luminosity function,and other fundamental
characteristics. We find that the vast majority of the YSGs in NGC 2403, NGC
300 and NGC 253 present inner clumpings, following the same hierarchical
behavior that we observed in the young stellar structures on larger scales in
these galaxies. We derived values of the fractal dimension for these structures
between ~ 1.5 and 1.6. These values are very similar to those obtained in other
star forming galaxies and in the interstellar medium, suggesting that the star
formation process is regulated by supersonic turbulence.

are the random graph connections, and the initial condition. The average number
of afferent edges on any particular vertex must diverge to infinity as $N\to
\infty$, but can do so at an arbitrarily slow rate. These results are thus
accurate for both sparse and dense random graphs. A particular application to
sparse Erdos-Renyi graphs is provided. The theorem is proved by pushing forward
a Large Deviation Principle for a `nested empirical measure' generated by the
initial conditions to the dynamics. The nested empirical measure can be thought
of as the density of the density of edge connections: the associated weak
topology is more coarse than the topology generated by the graph cut norm, and
thus there is a broader range of application.

optical measurements on a multipartite entangled quantum state -- a so-called
cluster state. Heretofore, a few quantum gates on non-universal or non-scalable

deterministic implementation of a multi-mode set of measurement-induced quantum

phase-controlled continuous variable quadrature measurements. Each gate is
simply programmed into the phases of the high-efficiency quadrature
measurements which execute the transformations by teleportation through the
cluster state. Using these programmable gates, we demonstrate a small quantum
circuit consisting of 10 single-mode gates and 2 two-mode gates on a three-mode

possible if the cluster state entanglement is improved and a supply of
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits is available. Moreover, it operates at the
telecom wavelength and is therefore network connectable without quantum

explained through planet--planet interactions, although no physically sound
argument favours the ubiquity of such interactions. No simple, generic
explanation has been put forward to explain the high mean eccentricity of these
planets. In this paper, we revisit a simple, plausible explanation to account
for the eccentricities of warm Jupiters: migration inside a cavity in the
protoplanetary disc. Such a scenario allows to excite the outer eccentric
resonances, a working mechanism for higher mass planets, leading to a growth in
the eccentricity while preventing other, closer resonances to damp
eccentricity. We test this idea with diverse numerical simulations, which show
that the eccentricity of a Jupiter-mass planet around a Sun-like star can
increase up to 0.4, a value never reached before with solely planet--disc
interactions. This high eccentricity is comparable to, if not larger than, the
median eccentricity of warm Saturn- to Jupiter-mass exoplanets. We also discuss
the effects such a mechanism would have on exoplanet observations. This
scenario could have strong consequences on the discs lifetime and the physics
of inner disc dispersal, which could be constrained by the eccentricity
distribution of gas giants.

curvature to the baryon-lepton current. We consider both broad and
monochromatic mass spectra for this purpose. For the monochromatic spectrum we
find that the correct dark matter and baryon energy densities are recovered for
peak masses of the spectrum of $M_{\rm pk} \geq 10^{12}$ kg whereas for the
broad case the observed energy densities can be reproduced regardless of peak
mass. Adopting some simplifications for the early-time expansion history as a
first approximation, we also find that the measured baryon asymmetry can be
recovered within an order of magnitude. We argue furthermore that the correct
value of the baryon-lepton yield can in principle be retrieved for scenarios
where a significant amount of the radiation is produced by PBH decay during or
after reheating, as is expected when the decaying PBHs also cause reheating, or
when an early matter-dominated phase is considered. We conclude from this first
analysis that the model merits further investigation.

there exhibits a long-ranged order regarding the flow connectivity, in contrast
to the qusi-long-range order associated with spin properties. Near $K_{\rm

standard finite-size scaling ansatz for a second-order phase transition. The

focusing on size and alternation depth. As a yardstick we take Wilke's
alternating tree automata, which we shall call parity formulas in the text.
Building on work by Bruse, Friedmann & Lange, we compare two size measures for
$\mu$-calculus formulas: subformula-size,i.e. , the number of subformulas of
the given formula, and closure-size. These notions correspond to the
representation of a formula as a parity formula based on, respectively, its
subformula dag, and its closure graph. What distinguishes our approach is that
we are explicit about the role of alpha-equivalence, as naively renaming bound
variables can lead to an exponential blow-up. In addition, we match the
formula's alternation depth with the index of the parity formula. We start in a
setting without alpha-equivalence. We define subformula-size and closure-size
and recall that a $\mu$-calculus formula can be transformed into a parity
formula of size linear wrt subformula size, and give a construction that
transforms a $\mu$-calculus formula into an equivalent parity formula linear
wrt closure-size. Conversely, there is a standard transformation producing a
$\mu$-calculus formula of exponential subformula -- but linear closure-size in
terms of the size of the original parity formula. We identify so-called
untwisted parity formulas for which a transformation linear in subformula-size
exists. We then introduce size notions that are completely invariant under
alpha equivalence. We transfer the result of Bruse et alii, showing that also
in our setting closure-size can be exponentially smaller than subformula-size.
We also show how to rename bound variables so that alpha-equivalence becomes
syntactic identity on the closure set. Finally, we review the complexity of
guarded transformations.

anti-correlated with the X-ray spectral state while correlated with optical-UV

$Q$ is the ground state. Previously, Duyckaerts-Merle studied the behavior of
threshold solutions in the $H^1$-critical case, in dimensions $N = 3, 4, 5$,
later generalized by Li-Zhang for higher dimensions. In the intercritical case,
Duyckaerts-Roudenko studied the threshold problem for the 3d cubic NLS
equation.
  In this paper, we generalize the results of Duyckaerts-Roudenko for any
dimension and any power of the nonlinearity for the entire intecritical range.
We show the existence of special solutions, $Q^\pm$, besides the standing wave
$e^{it}Q$, which exponentially approach the standing wave in the positive time
direction, but differ in its behavior for negative time. We classify all
solutions at the threshold level, showing either blow-up occurs in finite
(positive and negative) time, or scattering in both time directions, or the
solution is equal to one of the three special solutions above, up to
symmetries. Our proof extends to the $H^1$-critical case, thus, giving a
different and more unified approach than the Li-Zhang result.
  These results are obtained by studying the linearized equation around the
standing wave and some tailored approximate solutions to the NLS equation. We
establish important decay properties of functions associated to the spectrum of
the linearized Schr\""odinger operator, which, in combination with modulational
stability and coercivity for the linearized operator on special subspaces,
allows us to use a fixed-point argument to show the existence of special
solutions. Finally, we prove the uniqueness by studying exponentially decaying
solutions to a sequence of linearized equations.

spacetimes. The starting point of the analysis is a generic Hamiltonian
constraint where free functions of the triad and curvature components as well
as non-minimal couplings between geometric and matter degrees of freedom are
considered. Then, the requirement of anomaly freedom is imposed in order to
obtain a modified Hamiltonian that forms a first-class algebra. In this way, we
construct a family of consistent deformations of spherical general relativity,
which generalizes previous results in the literature. The discussed derivation
is implemented for vacuum as well as for two matter models: dust and scalar

technologies (PETs): Homomorphic Encryption and Secure Multiparty Computation
(defined together as Multiparty Homomorphic Encryption or MHE). These PETs
provide a mathematical guarantee of privacy, with MHE providing a performance
advantage over separately using HE or SMC. We argue MHE fulfills legal
requirements for medical data sharing under the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR) which has set a global benchmark for data protection.
Specifically, the data processed and shared using MHE can be considered
anonymized data. We explain how MHE can reduce the reliance on customized
contractual measures between institutions. The proposed approach can accelerate
the pace of medical research whilst offering additional incentives for
healthcare and research institutes to employ common data interoperability
standards.

challenges arise in a distributed framework due to the coupling constraint, so
that feasible solutions with guaranteed suboptimality bounds are of interest.
We propose a fully distributed algorithm based on a primal decomposition

algorithm is guaranteed to provide feasible solutions in finite time. Moreover,
asymptotic and finite-time suboptimality bounds are established for the

challenges due to the possible overlap of different contributions. Here, an
attempt is made to untangle the interaction between charged surfaces across
nanoparticle suspensions. Interaction forces are measured using colloidal-probe
atomic force microscopy. The experimental force profiles are considered as a
superposition of double layer and structural forces. In order to independently
describe the decay of the double layer force, the ionic strength of the
suspension is determined by electrolytic conductivity measurements. Jellium
approximation is used to define the impact of the fluid on screening the
surface potential. There, the nanoparticles are considered homogeneously
distributed across the fluid and screening is only carried out via the
particles counterions and added salt. The structural force follows a damped
oscillatory profile due to the layer-wise expulsion of the nanoparticles upon
approach of both surfaces. The description of the oscillatory structural force
is extended by a depletion layer next to the confining surfaces, with no
nanoparticles present. The thickness of the depletion layer is related to the
electrostatic repulsion of the charged nanoparticles from the like-charged
surfaces. The results show that the total force profile is a superposition of
independent force contributions without any mutual effects. Using this rather
simple model describes the complete experimentally determined interaction force
profiles very well from surface separations of a few hundred nanometres down to
the surfaces being almost in contact.

geographical scales remains largely unexplored. In this paper we analyse to
which extent the battery-assisted charging can replace high-speed chargers
using a dataset of over 3 million EV charging sessions in both domestic and

that takes into account battery capacity, grid supply capacity and power output
among other parameters. We then run simulations to evaluate the
battery-assisted charging performance in terms of delivered energy, charging
time and parity with conventional high-speed chargers. The results indicate
that in domestic settings battery-assisted charging provides 98% performance
parity of high-speed chargers from a standard 3 kW grid connection with a
single battery pack. For non-domestic settings, the battery-assisted chargers
can provide 92% and 99% performance parity of high-speed chargers with 10
battery packs using 3kW and 7kW grid supply respectively.

purely algebraic theory of clones. Clone algebras are defined by true
identities and thus form a variety in the sense of universal algebra. The most
natural clone algebras, the ones the axioms are intended to characterise, are
algebras of functions, called functional clone algebras. The universe of a
functional clone algebra, called omega-clone, is a set of infinitary operations
containing the projections and closed under finitary compositions. We show that
there exists a bijective correspondence between clones (of finitary operations)
and a suitable subclass of functional clone algebras, called block algebras.
Given a clone, the corresponding block algebra is obtained by extending the
operations of the clone by countably many dummy arguments.
  One of the main results of this paper is the general representation theorem,
where it is shown that every clone algebra is isomorphic to a functional clone
algebra. In another result of the paper we prove that the variety of clone
algebras is generated by the class of block algebras. This implies that every
omega-clone is algebraically generated by a suitable family of clones by using
direct products, subalgebras and homomorphic images.
  We conclude the paper with two applications. In the first one, we use clone
algebras to answer a classical question about the lattices of equational
theories. The second application is to the study of the category VAR of all
varieties. We introduce the category CA of all clone algebras (of arbitrary
similarity type) with pure homomorphisms as arrows. We show that the category
VAR is categorically isomorphic to a full subcategory of CA. We use this result
to provide a generalisation of a classical theorem on independent varieties.

training data; instead, it optimizes the weights of a neural network to
generate image samples that fit a particular measurement dataset. Once the
network weights have been learned, the posterior distribution can be
efficiently sampled. We demonstrate this approach in the context of
interferometric radio imaging, which is used for black hole imaging with the
Event Horizon Telescope, and compressed sensing Magnetic Resonance Imaging

pluralism and consistently represent major and minor social groups. Currently,
there are no standard evaluation techniques for different types of biases.
Accordingly, there is an urgent need to provide evaluation sets and protocols
to measure existing biases in our automatic systems. Evaluating the biases
should be an essential step towards mitigating them in the systems.
  This paper introduces WinoST, a new freely available challenge set for
evaluating gender bias in speech translation. WinoST is the speech version of
WinoMT which is a MT challenge set and both follow an evaluation protocol to
measure gender accuracy. Using a state-of-the-art end-to-end speech translation
system, we report the gender bias evaluation on four language pairs and we show
that gender accuracy in speech translation is more than 23% lower than in MT.

positive regular function $\omega(\ell)$ such that $\omega(\ell) \sim \ell^p$

left side of the general force-free jet/wind equation (the ""pulsar"" equation)
is separated into a rotating and a nonrotating term. The two equations with
either term can be solved analytically, and the two solutions match each other
very well. Therefore, we obtain a general approximate solution of a
magnetically dominated jet/wind, which covers from the nonrelativistic to
relativistic regimes, with the drift velocity well matching the cold plasma
velocity. The acceleration of a jet includes three stages. (1) The jet flow is
located within the Alfv\'{e}n critical surface (i.e. the light cylinder), has a
nonrelativistic speed, and is dominated by toroidal motion. (2) The jet is
beyond the Alfv\'{e}n critical surface where the flow is dominated by poloidal
motion and becomes relativistic. The total velocity in these two stages follows
the same law $v\Gamma=\Omega R$. (3) The evolution law is replaced by
$v\Gamma\approx1/\left(\theta\sqrt{2-\nu}\right)$, where $\theta$ is the
half-opening angle of the jet and $0\leq\nu\leq2$ is a free parameter
determined by the magnetic field configuration. This is because the earlier
efficient acceleration finally breaks the causality connection between
different parts in the jet, preventing a global solution. The jet has to carry
local charges and currents to support an electromagnetic balance. This
approximate solution is consistent with known theoretical results and numerical
simulations, and it is more convenient to directly compare with observations.
This theory may be used to constrain the spin of black holes in astrophysical

we used pattern recognition and artificial intelligence techniques to innovate
the palaeography of the scrolls regarding writer identification and to pioneer
the microlevel of individual scribes to open access to the Bible's ancient

scribe, we report new evidence for a breaking point in the series of columns in
this scroll. Without prior assumption of writer identity, based on point clouds
of the reduced-dimensionality feature-space, we found that columns from the
first and second halves of the manuscript ended up in two distinct zones of
such scatter plots, notably for a range of digital palaeography tools, each
addressing very different featural aspects of the script samples. In a
secondary, independent, analysis, now assuming writer difference and using yet
another independent feature method and several different types of statistical
testing, a switching point was found in the column series. A clear phase
transition is apparent around column 27. Given the statistically significant
differences between the two halves, a tertiary, post-hoc analysis was
performed. Demonstrating that two main scribes were responsible for the Great

allows hardware SCL decoders to dynamically shut down part of the internal

corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 8.5 fb$^{-1}$, the observation of
a new excited $\Xi_b^0$ resonance decaying to the $\Xi_b^-\pi^+$ final state is
presented. The state, referred to as $\Xi_b(6227)^0$, has a measured mass and
natural width of
  $m(\Xi_b(6227)^0) = 6227.1^{\,+1.4}_{\,-1.5}\pm0.5$ MeV,
  $\Gamma(\Xi_b(6227)^0) = 18.6^{\,+5.0}_{\,-4.1}\pm1.4$ MeV, where the
uncertainties are statistical and systematic. The production rate of the
$\Xi_b(6227)^0$ state relative to that of the $\Xi_b^-$ baryon in the kinematic
region $2<\eta<5$ and $p_{\rm T}<30$ GeV is measured to be
  $\frac{f_{\Xi_b(6227)^0}}{f_{\Xi_b^-}}{\mathcal{B}}(\Xi_b(6227)^0\to\Xi_b^-\pi^+)
= 0.045\pm0.008\pm0.004$, where ${\mathcal{B}}(\Xi_b(6227)^0\to\Xi_b^-\pi^+)$
is the branching fraction of the decay, and $f_{\Xi_b(6227)^0}$ and
$f_{\Xi_b^-}$ represent fragmentation fractions.
  Improved measurements of the mass and natural width of the previously
observed $\Xi_b(6227)^-$ state, along with the mass of the $\Xi_b^-$ baryon,
are also reported. Both measurements are significantly more precise than, and
consistent with, previously reported values.

  over Random Time-Varying Graphs",,,,,"math.OC cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The paper addresses large-scale, convex optimization problems that need to be
solved in a distributed way by agents communicating according to a random
time-varying graph. Specifically, the goal of the network is to minimize the
sum of local costs, while satisfying local and coupling constraints. Agents
communicate according to a time-varying model in which edges of an underlying
connected graph are active at each iteration with certain non-uniform
probabilities. By relying on a primal decomposition scheme applied to an
equivalent problem reformulation, we propose a novel distributed algorithm in
which agents negotiate a local allocation of the total resource only with
neighbors with active communication links. The algorithm is studied as a
subgradient method with block-wise updates, in which blocks correspond to the
graph edges that are active at each iteration. Thanks to this analysis
approach, we show almost sure convergence to the optimal cost of the original
problem and almost sure asymptotic primal recovery without resorting to
averaging mechanisms typically employed in dual decomposition schemes. Explicit
sublinear convergence rates are provided under the assumption of diminishing
and constant step-sizes. Finally, an extensive numerical study on a plug-in
electric vehicle charging problem corroborates the theoretical results.

"2010.14490","Noam Soker","Noam Soker (Technion, Israel)","The circumstellar matter of type II intermediate luminosity optical
  transients (ILOTs)","Accepted for publication in Research in Astronomy and Astrophysics",,"10.1088/1674-4527/21/5/112",,"astro-ph.HE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  I find that a 0.1-1Mo outflowing equatorial dusty disk (torus) that the
binary system progenitor of an intermediate luminosity optical transient (ILOT)
ejects several years to several months before and during the outburst can
reduce the total emission to an equatorial observer by two orders of magnitude
and shifts the emission to wavelengths of mainly >10mum. This is termed a type
II ILOT (ILOT II). To reach this conclusion I use calculations of type II
active galactic nuclei and apply them to the equatorial ejecta (disk/torus) of
ILOTs II. This reduction in emission can last for tens of years after outburst.
Most of the radiation escapes along the polar directions. The attenuation of
the emission for wavelengths of <5mum can be more than three orders of
magnitudes, and the emission at <2mum is negligible. Jets that the binary
system launches during the outburst can collide with polar CSM and emit
radiation above the equatorial plane and dust in the polar outflow can reflect
emission from the central source. Therefore, during the event itself the
equatorial observer might detect an ILOT. I strengthen the previously suggested

since the 1918 influenza pandemic. During pandemics such as COVID-19, timely
and reliable spatio-temporal forecasting of epidemic dynamics is crucial. Deep
learning-based time series models for forecasting have recently gained
popularity and have been successfully used for epidemic forecasting. Here we
focus on the design and analysis of deep learning-based models for COVID-19
forecasting. We implement multiple recurrent neural network-based deep learning
models and combine them using the stacking ensemble technique. In order to
incorporate the effects of multiple factors in COVID-19 spread, we consider
multiple sources such as COVID-19 confirmed and death case count data and
testing data for better predictions. To overcome the sparsity of training data
and to address the dynamic correlation of the disease, we propose
clustering-based training for high-resolution forecasting. The methods help us
to identify the similar trends of certain groups of regions due to various
spatio-temporal effects. We examine the proposed method for forecasting weekly
COVID-19 new confirmed cases at county-, state-, and country-level. A
comprehensive comparison between different time series models in COVID-19
context is conducted and analyzed. The results show that simple deep learning
models can achieve comparable or better performance when compared with more
complicated models. We are currently integrating our methods as a part of our
weekly forecasts that we provide state and federal authorities.

typically narrow: the policy can only execute the task in a handful of
scenarios that it was trained on. What if there was a way to incorporate a
large amount of prior data, either from previously solved tasks or from
unsupervised or undirected environment interaction, to extend and generalize
learned behaviors? While most prior work on extending robotic skills using
pre-collected data focuses on building explicit hierarchies or skill
decompositions, we show in this paper that we can reuse prior data to extend
new skills simply through dynamic programming. We show that even when the prior
data does not actually succeed at solving the new task, it can still be
utilized for learning a better policy, by providing the agent with a broader
understanding of the mechanics of its environment. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by chaining together several behaviors seen in

non-local dissipation display directional amplification when associated with a
non-trivial winding number of the NH dynamic matrix. In this work, we show
analytically that the correspondence between NH topology and directional
amplification holds even in the presence of disorder. When a system with
non-trivial topology is tuned close to the exceptional point, perfect
non-reciprocity (quantified by a vanishing reverse gain) is preserved for
arbitrarily strong on-site disorder. For bounded disorder, we derive simple
bounds for the probability distribution of the scattering matrix elements.
These bounds show that the essential features associated with non-trivial NH

simulators. These machine learning methods are capable of reconstructing a
quantum state from experimental measurements, and can aid in the calculation of
physical observables. In this paper, we employ a recurrent neural network (RNN)
to reconstruct the ground state of the spin-1/2 XY model, a prototypical
Hamiltonian explored in trapped ion simulators. We explore its performance
after enforcing a U(1) symmetry, which was recently shown by Hibat-Allah et al.
[Phys. Rev. Research 2, 023358 (2020)] to preserve the autoregressive nature of
the RNN. By studying the reconstruction of the XY model ground state from
projective measurement data, we show that imposing U(1) symmetry on the RNN
significantly increases the efficiency of learning, particularly in the early
epoch regime. We argue that this performance increase may result from the
tendency of the enforced symmetry to alleviate vanishing and exploding
gradients, which helps stabilize the training process. Thus, symmetry-enforced
RNNs may be particularly useful for applications of quantum simulators where a
rapid feedback between optimization and circuit preparation is necessary, such
as in hybrid classical-quantum algorithms.

study this phenomenon in the presence of a rotating BTZ black hole, and find
that rotation can significantly amplify the harvested vacuum entanglement.
Concurrence between co-rotating detectors is amplified by as much as an order
of magnitude at intermediate distances from the black hole relative to that at
large distances. The effect is most pronounced for near-extremal small mass
black holes, and allows for harvesting at large spacelike detector separations.
We also find that the entanglement shadow -- a region near the black hole from
which entanglement cannot be extracted -- is diminished in size as the black
hole's angular momentum increases.

particular perform for the first time in the context of BHNS binaries a

that start in a coherent superposition of possible outcomes always remain as a

left with a formulation of quantum mechanics purely defined in quantum

parameterized by $f_{\rm NL}$, we perform a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain analysis
to confront perturbation theory predictions of the halo power spectrum and
bispectrum in real space against a suite of N-body simulations. We model the
halo bispectrum at tree-level, including all contributions linear and quadratic
in $f_{\rm NL}$, and the halo power spectrum at 1-loop, including tree-level
terms up to quadratic order in $f_{\rm NL}$ and all loops induced by local PNG
linear in $f_{\rm NL}$. Keeping the cosmological parameters fixed, we examine
the effect of informative priors on the linear non-Gaussian bias parameter on
the statistical inference of $f_{\rm NL}$. A conservative analysisof the
combined power spectrum and bispectrum, in which only loose priors are imposed
and all parameters are marginalized over, can improve the constraint on $f_{\rm
NL}$ by more than a factor of 5 relative to the power spectrum-only
measurement. Imposing a strong prior on $b_\phi$, or assuming bias relations
for both $b_\phi$ and $b_{\phi\delta}$ (motivated by a universal mass function
assumption), improves the constraints further by a factor of few. In this case,
however, we find a significant systematic shift in the inferred value of
$f_{\rm NL}$ if the same range of wavenumber is used. Likewise, a Poisson noise
assumption can lead to significant systematics, and it is thus essential to
leave all the stochastic amplitudes free.

passages. Narrow passages induce a higher runtime, because the chance to sample
them becomes vanishingly small. In recent work, we showed that narrow passages
can be approached by relaxing the problem using admissible lower-dimensional
projections of the state space. Those relaxations often increase the volume of
narrow passages under projection. Solving the relaxed problem is often
efficient and produces an admissible heuristic we can exploit. However, given a
base path, i.e. a solution to a relaxed problem, there are currently no
tailored methods to efficiently exploit the base path. To efficiently exploit
the base path and thereby its admissible heuristic, we develop section
patterns, which are solution strategies to efficiently exploit base paths in
particular around narrow passages. To coordinate section patterns, we develop
the pattern dance algorithm, which efficiently coordinates section patterns to
reactively traverse narrow passages. We combine the pattern dance algorithm
with previously developed multilevel planning algorithms and benchmark them on
challenging planning problems like the Bugtrap, the double L-shape, an egress
problem and on four pregrasp scenarios for a 37 degrees of freedom shadow hand
mounted on a KUKA LWR robot. Our results confirm that section patterns are
useful to efficiently solve high-dimensional narrow passage motion planning

  Zimmerman, Y. Zlochower, M. E. Zucker, J. Zweizig","GWTC-2: Compact Binary Coalescences Observed by LIGO and Virgo During
  the First Half of the Third Observing Run","This version updates with minor revisions to typographical errors. We
  would also like to call attention to the updated parameter estimation samples
  data release here: https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P2000223/public","Phys. Rev. X 11, 021053 (2021)","10.1103/PhysRevX.11.021053","P2000061","gr-qc astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report on gravitational wave discoveries from compact binary coalescences
detected by Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo in the first half of the third
observing run (O3a) between 1 April 2019 15:00 UTC and 1 October 2019 15:00. By
imposing a false-alarm-rate threshold of two per year in each of the four
search pipelines that constitute our search, we present 39 candidate
gravitational wave events. At this threshold, we expect a contamination
fraction of less than 10%. Of these, 26 candidate events were reported
previously in near real-time through GCN Notices and Circulars; 13 are reported
here for the first time. The catalog contains events whose sources are black
hole binary mergers up to a redshift of ~0.8, as well as events whose
components could not be unambiguously identified as black holes or neutron
stars. For the latter group, we are unable to determine the nature based on
estimates of the component masses and spins from gravitational wave data alone.
The range of candidate events which are unambiguously identified as binary
black holes (both objects $\geq 3~M_\odot$) is increased compared to GWTC-1,
with total masses from $\sim 14~M_\odot$ for GW190924_021846 to $\sim
150~M_\odot$ for GW190521. For the first time, this catalog includes binary
systems with significantly asymmetric mass ratios, which had not been observed
in data taken before April 2019. We also find that 11 of the 39 events detected
since April 2019 have positive effective inspiral spins under our default prior
(at 90% credibility), while none exhibit negative effective inspiral spin.
Given the increased sensitivity of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, the
detection of 39 candidate events in ~26 weeks of data (~1.5 per week) is
consistent with GWTC-1.

dynamical and strong-field regime. Using events detected by LIGO-Virgo up to 1
October 2019, we evaluate the consistency of the data with predictions from the
theory. We first establish that residuals from the best-fit waveform are
consistent with detector noise, and that the low- and high-frequency parts of
the signals are in agreement. We then consider parametrized modifications to
the waveform by varying post-Newtonian and phenomenological coefficients,
improving past constraints by factors of ${\sim}2$; we also find consistency
with Kerr black holes when we specifically target signatures of the
spin-induced quadrupole moment. Looking for gravitational-wave dispersion, we
tighten constraints on Lorentz-violating coefficients by a factor of
${\sim}2.6$ and bound the mass of the graviton to $m_g \leq 1.76 \times
10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}/c^2$ with 90% credibility. We also analyze the properties
of the merger remnants by measuring ringdown frequencies and damping times,
constraining fractional deviations away from the Kerr frequency to $\delta
\hat{f}_{220} = 0.03^{+0.38}_{-0.35}$ for the fundamental quadrupolar mode, and
$\delta \hat{f}_{221} = 0.04^{+0.27}_{-0.32}$ for the first overtone;
additionally, we find no evidence for postmerger echoes. Finally, we determine
that our data are consistent with tensorial polarizations through a
template-independent method. When possible, we assess the validity of general
relativity based on collections of events analyzed jointly. We find no evidence
for new physics beyond general relativity, for black hole mimickers, or for any
unaccounted systematics.

expected from upcoming surveys. The dispersion measures (DM) observed for FRB
include important information on cosmological distances and the ionization
state of the universe from the redshift of emission until today. Rather than
considering the DM--redshift relation, we investigate the statistical ensemble
of the distribution of dispersion measures. We explore the use of this
abundance information, with and without redshift information, to probe helium
reionization. Carrying out Monte Carlo simulations of FRB survey samples, we
examine the effect of different source redshift distributions, host galaxy
models, sudden vs gradual reionization, and covariance with cosmological
parameters on determination of helium reionization properties. We find that a
fluence limited survey with 10$^4$ FRBs can discriminate different helium
reionization histories at $\sim6\sigma$ using the DM-distribution of bursts,
without redshift information (and $\sim10\sigma$ with redshifts).

paper we use existing and novel ranking fairness metrics to evaluate viewpoint
diversity in search result rankings. We conduct a controlled simulation study
that shows how ranking fairness metrics can be used for viewpoint diversity,
how their outcome should be interpreted, and which metric is most suitable
depending on the situation. This paper lays out important ground work for
future research to measure and assess viewpoint diversity in real search result

information on their redshifts and on their low energy photon fields. This
information is key to understand the effect on the gamma-ray absorption due to
either extragalactic background light and/or intrinsic absorption and emission
processes. All this information has also an impact on the determination of the
location of the emitting region within the relativistic jets. In this work a
new optical spectroscopic characterization is presented for three gamma-ray
blazars: S4 0954+65, TXS 1515-273 and RX J0812.0+0237. For all the three
targets the redshift determination is successful, and for the first time in the
case of TXS 1515-273 and RX J0812.0+0237. Their classification as BL~Lac type
is confirmed based on these new optical spectra. For S4 0954+65
(z=$0.3694\pm0.0011$) an estimation on the disk, broad line region and torus
luminosities is performed based on the observed optical emission lines. The
results from this study are compatible with the nature of S4 0954+65 as a
transitional blazar. In the case of TXS 1515-273 ($z=0.1281\pm 0.0004$),
although its optical spectrum is dominated by the continuum emission from the
jet, applying the pPXF technique, the stellar population can be unveiled and is
compatible with an old and metallic population. It is also the case of RX
J0812.0+0237 ($z=0.1721\pm 0.0002$). Moreover, this work confirms that the
optical spectrum from RX J0812.0+0237 is compatible with an extreme blazar
classification.

  Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog","53 pages, including 24 pages main text, 18 pages appendix, 30 figures",,"10.3847/2041-8213/abe949","LIGO-P2000077","astro-ph.HE gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report on the population of the 47 compact binary mergers detected with a
false-alarm rate 1/yr in the second LIGO--Virgo Gravitational-Wave Transient
Catalog, GWTC-2. We observe several characteristics of the merging binary black
hole (BBH) population not discernible until now. First, we find that the
primary mass spectrum contains structure beyond a power-law with a sharp
high-mass cut-off; it is more consistent with a broken power law with a break
at $39.7^{+20.3}_{-9.1}\,M_\odot$, or a power law with a Gaussian feature
peaking at $33.1^{+4.0}_{-5.6}\,M_\odot$ (90\% credible interval). While the
primary mass distribution must extend to $\sim65\,M_\odot$ or beyond, only
$2.9^{+3.5}_{1.7}\%$ of systems have primary masses greater than $45\,M_\odot$.
Second, we find that a fraction of BBH systems have component spins misaligned
with the orbital angular momentum, giving rise to precession of the orbital
plane. Moreover, 12% to 44% of BBH systems have spins tilted by more than
$90^\circ$, giving rise to a negative effective inspiral spin parameter
$\chi_\mathrm{eff}$. Under the assumption that such systems can only be formed
by dynamical interactions, we infer that between 25% and 93% of BBH with
non-vanishing $|\chi_\mathrm{eff}| > 0.01$ are dynamically assembled. Third, we
estimate merger rates, finding $\mathcal{R}_\text{BBH} = 23.9^{+14.3}_{8.6}$
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for BBH and $\mathcal{R}_\text{BNS}= 320^{+490}_{-240}$
Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for binary neutron stars. We find that the BBH rate likely
increases with redshift ($85\%$ credibility), but not faster than the
star-formation rate ($86\%$ credibility). Additionally, we examine recent
exceptional events in the context of our population models, finding that the
asymmetric masses of GW190412 and the high component masses of GW190521 are
consistent with our models, but the low secondary mass of GW190814 makes it an
outlier.

representational knowledge source of choice in NLP systems. Since a variety of
biases have previously been found in standard word embeddings, it is crucial to
assess biases encoded in their replacements as well. Focusing on BERT (Devlin
et al., 2018), we measure gender bias by studying associations between
gender-denoting target words and names of professions in English and German,
comparing the findings with real-world workforce statistics. We mitigate bias
by fine-tuning BERT on the GAP corpus (Webster et al., 2018), after applying
Counterfactual Data Substitution (CDS) (Maudslay et al., 2019). We show that
our method of measuring bias is appropriate for languages such as English, but
not for languages with a rich morphology and gender-marking, such as German.
Our results highlight the importance of investigating bias and mitigation
techniques cross-linguistically, especially in view of the current emphasis on
large-scale, multilingual language models.

we exploit a differentiable NAS algorithm on our relaxed continuous search

polarization modes beyond general relativity. The LIGO-Virgo collaboration
analyzed several GW events in the O1 and O2 observing runs in the pure
polarization framework, where they perform the Bayesian model selection between
general relativity and the theory allowing only scalar or vector polarization
modes. In this paper, we reanalyze the polarizations of GW170814 (binary black

framework of pure polarizations including the angular patterns of nontensorial
radiation. We find logarithms of the Bayes factors of 2.775 and 3.636 for
GW170814 in favor of the pure tensor polarization against pure vector and
scalar polarizations, respectively. These Bayes factors are consistent with the
previous results by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration, though the estimated
parameters of the binaries are significantly biased. For GW170817 with the
priors on the location of the binary from NGC4993, we find logarithms of the
Bayes factors of 21.078 and 44.544 in favor of the pure tensor polarization

support GR, epecially compared to the scalar polarization, than the previous
results by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration due to the location prior. In addition,
by utilizing the orientation information of the binary from a gamma-ray burst
jet, we find logarithms of the Bayes factor of 51.043 and 60.271 in favor of
the pure tensor polarization against pure vector and pure scalar polarization,
much improved from those without the jet prior.

that such emission is dominated by $\sim10-40$ pc clumps and filamentary

of neutrinos from a galactic supernova burst, or one-year exposure to solar and

similar, but slightly improved, potential to COHERENT will be provided for
larger mediator masses. In particular, RES-NOVA and DARWIN may potentially
provide one order of magnitude tighter constraints than XENON1T on the mediator
coupling. Non-standard coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering may also force
neutrinos to be trapped in the supernova core; this argument allows to probe

physics models that feature scalar triplets. In this study, we aim to probe the
strength of the aforementioned interaction in a model-agnostic fashion at the
futuristic 27 TeV proton-proton collider. We assume that the $H^\pm$ couples
dominantly to ($W^\pm,Z$) and ($t,b$). We specifically study the processes that
involve the $H^\pm W^\mp Z$ vertex at the production level, that is, $p p \to
H^\pm j j$ and $p p \to Z H^\pm$. Moreover, we look into both $H^\pm \to W^\pm
Z,~t b$ decays for either production process. Our investigations reveal that
the $H^\pm j j$ production process has a greater reach compared to $Z H^\pm$.
Moreover, the discovery potential of a charged Higgs improves markedly with
respect to the earlier studies corresponding to lower centre-of-mass energies.
Finally, we recast our results in the context of the popular Georgi-Machacek
model.

mapping program states to numbers - for probabilistic program verification. We
prove that our syntax is expressive in the following sense: Given any
probabilistic program $C$, if a function $f$ is expressible in our syntax, then
the function mapping each initial state $\sigma$ to the expected value of $f$
evaluated in the final states reached after termination of $C$ on $\sigma$
(also called the weakest preexpectation $\textit{wp} [C](f)$) is also
expressible in our syntax.
  As a consequence, we obtain a relatively complete verification system for
reasoning about expected values and probabilities in the sense of Cook: Apart
from proving a single inequality between two functions given by syntactic
expressions in our language, given $f$, $g$, and $C$, we can check whether $g
\preceq \textit{wp} [C] (f)$.

In previous work, graph properties were specified by so-called E-conditions
which extend nested graph conditions. However, this type of assertions is not
easy to comprehend by programmers that are used to formal specifications in
standard first-order logic. In this paper, we present an approach to verify GP
2 programs with a standard first-order logic. We show how to construct a
strongest liberal postcondition with respect to a rule schema and a
precondition. We then extend this construction to obtain strongest liberal
postconditions for arbitrary loop-free programs. Compared with previous work,
this allows to reason about a vastly generalised class of graph programs. In
particular, many programs with nested loops can be verified with the new
calculus.

ones, comes with an increasing interest in tools to understand and interpret
them. In this paper, we consider in particular how to characterise visual
groupings discovered automatically by deep neural networks, starting with
state-of-the-art clustering methods. In some cases, clusters readily correspond
to an existing labelled dataset. However, often they do not, yet they still
maintain an ""intuitive interpretability"". We introduce two concepts, visual
learnability and describability, that can be used to quantify the
interpretability of arbitrary image groupings, including unsupervised ones. The
idea is to measure (1) how well humans can learn to reproduce a grouping by
measuring their ability to generalise from a small set of visual examples
(learnability) and (2) whether the set of visual examples can be replaced by a
succinct, textual description (describability). By assessing human annotators
as classifiers, we remove the subjective quality of existing evaluation
metrics. For better scalability, we finally propose a class-level captioning
system to generate descriptions for visual groupings automatically and compare
it to human annotators using the describability metric.

efficiency of quantum teleportation which we quantify using the first two
moments of fidelity. The input knowledge is introduced by relaxing the
uniformity assumption in the distribution of the input state and considering
non-uniform distributions, namely the polar cap and von Mises-Fisher densities.
For these distributions,we show that the average fidelity increases while the
deviation decreases with the increase of information content about the input
ensemble thereby establishing its role as a resource. Our comparative study
between these two distributions reveals that for the same amount of information
content about inputs, although the average fidelity yield is the same for both,
the polar cap distribution is ""better"" as it offers a smaller deviation.
Moreover, we contrast the resource of prior information with other resources
involved in the protocol like shared entanglement and classical communication.
Specifically, we observe that unlike uniform distribution, the amount of
classical communication required to fulfill the task decreases with the
increase of information available for inputs. We also investigate the role of
prior information in higher (three) dimensional teleportation and report the
signatures of dimensional advantage in prior information-based teleportation.

We
deal with the problem of the algebraic approximation of the set
$j^{r}f^{-1}(W)$ consisting of the set of points in the disk $D$ where the
$r$-th jet extension of $f$ meets a given semialgebraic set $W\subset J^{r}(D,
\mathbb{R}^k).$ Examples of sets arising in this way are the zero set of $f$,
or the set of its critical points.
  Under some transversality conditions, we prove that $f$ can be approximated
with a polynomial map $p:D\to \mathbb{R}^k$ such that the corresponding
singularity is diffeomorphic to the original one, and such that the degree of
this polynomial map can be controlled by the $C^{r+2}$ data of $f$. More
precisely, \begin{equation} \text{deg}(p)\le O\left(\frac{\|f\|_{C^{r+2}(D,
\mathbb{R}^k)}}{\mathrm{dist}_{C^{r+1}}(f, \Delta_W)}\right), \end{equation}
  where $\Delta_W$ is the set of maps whose $r$-th jet extension is not
transverse to $W$. The estimate on the degree of $p$ implies an estimate on the
Betti numbers of the singularity, however, using more refined tools, we prove
independently a similar estimate, but involving only the $C^{r+1}$ data of $f$.
  These results specialize to the case of zero sets of $f\in C^{2}(D,
\mathbb{R})$, and give a way to approximate a smooth hypersurface defined by
the equation $f=0$ with an algebraic one, with controlled degree (from which
the title of the paper). In particular, we show that a compact hypersurface
$Z\subset D\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with positive reach $\rho(Z)>0$ is isotopic to
the zero set in $D$ of a polynomial $p$ of degree \begin{equation}
\text{deg}(p)\leq c(D)\cdot 2

$c(D)>0$ is a constant depending on the size of the disk $D$ (and in particular

null hypothesis of no treatment effect on any units whatsoever and allows for
flexible covariate adjustment to improve the power. Of interest is whether the
procedure could also be valid for testing the weak null hypothesis of zero
average treatment effect. Towards this end, we evaluate two general strategies
for FRT with covariate-adjusted test statistics: that based on the residuals
from an outcome model with only the covariates, and that based on the output
from an outcome model with both the treatment and the covariates. Based on
theory and simulation, we recommend using the ordinary least squares (OLS) fit
of the observed outcome on the treatment, centered covariates, and their
interactions for covariate adjustment, and conducting FRT with the robust
$t$-value of the treatment as the test statistic. The resulting FRT is
finite-sample exact for the strong null hypothesis, asymptotically valid for
the weak null hypothesis, and more powerful than the unadjusted analog under
alternatives, all irrespective of whether the linear model is correctly
specified or not. We develop the theory for complete randomization, cluster
randomization, stratified randomization, and rerandomization, respectively, and
give a recommendation for the test procedure and test statistic under each
design. We first focus on the finite-population perspective and then extend the
result to the super-population perspective, highlighting the difference in
standard errors. Motivated by the similarity in procedure, we also evaluate the
design-based properties of five existing permutation tests originally for
linear models and show the superiority of the proposed FRT for testing the
treatment effects.

Allen-Cahn equation (ACE) with fidelity forcing on graphs. Bertozzi and Flenner
(2012) pioneered the use of this differential equation as a method for graph
classification problems, such as semi-supervised learning and image
segmentation. In Merkurjev, Kosti\'c, and Bertozzi (2013), a
Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme with fidelity forcing was used instead, as
the MBO scheme is heuristically similar to the ACE. This paper rigorously
establishes the graph MBO scheme with fidelity forcing as a special case of an
SDIE scheme for the graph ACE with fidelity forcing. This connection requires
using the double-obstacle potential in the ACE, as was shown in Budd and Van
Gennip (2020) for ACE without fidelity forcing. We also prove that solutions of
the SDIE scheme converge to solutions of the graph ACE with fidelity forcing as
the SDIE time step tends to zero.
  Next, we develop the SDIE scheme as a classification algorithm. We also
introduce some innovations into the algorithms for the SDIE and MBO schemes.
For large graphs, we use a QR decomposition method to compute an
eigendecomposition from a Nystr\""om extension, which outperforms the method
used in e.g. Bertozzi and Flenner (2012) in accuracy, stability, and speed.
Moreover, we replace the Euler discretisation for the scheme's diffusion step
by a computation based on the Strang formula for matrix exponentials. We apply
this algorithm to a number of image segmentation problems, and compare the
performance of the SDIE and MBO schemes. We find that whilst the general SDIE
scheme does not perform better than the MBO special case at this task, our
other innovations lead to a significantly better segmentation than that from
previous literature. We also empirically quantify the uncertainty that this
segmentation inherits from the randomness in the Nystr\""om extension.

remotely, there is a shift in the antennas incurring top 10% of the total
traffic, with the number of connections made to antennas in downtown Rio
reducing drastically and antennas at other locations taking their place. We
also observe that while nearly 40-45% users connected to only 1 antenna each
day during the lockdown phase indicating no mobility, there are around 4% users
(i.e., 80K users) who connected to more than 10 antennas, indicating very high
mobility. Finally, we design an interactive tool that showcases mobility
patterns in different granularities that can potentially help people and
government officials understand the mobility of individuals and the number of
COVID cases in a particular neighborhood. Our analysis, inferences, and
interactive showcasing of mobility patterns based on large-scale data can be

system, which does not align with how humans are known to parse sentences.
Psycholinguistic research suggests that human parsing is strongly incremental:
humans grow a single parse tree by adding exactly one token at each step. In
this paper, we propose a novel transition system called attach-juxtapose. It is
strongly incremental; it represents a partial sentence using a single tree;
each action adds exactly one token into the partial tree. Based on our
transition system, we develop a strongly incremental parser. At each step, it
encodes the partial tree using a graph neural network and predicts an action.
We evaluate our parser on Penn Treebank (PTB) and Chinese Treebank (CTB). On
PTB, it outperforms existing parsers trained with only constituency trees; and
it performs on par with state-of-the-art parsers that use dependency trees as
additional training data. On CTB, our parser establishes a new state of the
art. Code is available at

inventory and provide several buying choices to online shoppers. It is critical
for eCommerce search engines to showcase in the top results the variety and
selection of inventory available, specifically in the context of the various
buying intents that may be associated with a search query. Search rankers are
most commonly powered by learning-to-rank models which learn the preference
between items during training. However, they score items independent of other
items at runtime. Although the items placed at top of the results by such
scoring functions may be independently optimal, they can be sub-optimal as a
set. This may lead to a mismatch between the ideal distribution of items in the
top results vs what is actually impressed. In this paper, we present methods to
address the purchase-impression gap observed in top search results on eCommerce
sites. We establish the ideal distribution of items based on historic shopping
patterns. We then present a sequential reranker that methodically reranks top
search results produced by a conventional pointwise scoring ranker. The
reranker produces a reordered list by sequentially selecting candidates trading
off between their independent relevance and potential to address the
purchase-impression gap by utilizing specially constructed features that
capture impression distribution of items already added to a reranked list. The
sequential reranker enables addressing purchase impression gap with respect to
multiple item aspects. Early version of the reranker showed promising lifts in
conversion and engagement metrics at eBay. Based on experiments on randomly
sampled validation datasets, we observe that the reranking methodology
presented produces around 10% reduction in purchase-impression gap at an
average for the top 20 results, while making improvements to conversion
metrics.

both fast and slow sampling of control signals, the latter by way of
stroboscopic sampling strategies. The biDMD method provides a flexible,

implementation in quantum systems. Further, the method has strong theoretical
connections to Koopman theory, which approximates non-linear dynamics with
linear operators. In comparison with many machine learning paradigms, it
requires minimal data and the biDMD model is easily updated as new data is
collected. We demonstrate the efficacy and performance of the approach on a
number of representative quantum systems, showing that it also matches

including the search for extra pulses following the GR waveform for the
coalescence of compact objects. The motivation for these searches comes from
the alternative proposal that the final compact object could differ from a
black hole (BH) by the lack of an event horizon and a central singularity. Such
objects are expected in theories that, motivated by quantum gravity
modifications, predict horizonless objects as the final stage of gravitational
collapse. In such a hypothetical case, this exotic compact object (ECO) will
present a (partially) reflective surface at $r_{\rm ECO}=r_{+}(1+\epsilon)$,
instead of an event horizon at $r_{+}$. For this class of objects, an
in-falling wave will not be completely lost and will give rise to secondary
pulses, to which recent literature refers as echoes. However, the largely
unknown ECO reflectivity is determinant for the amplitude of the signal, and
details also depend on the initial conditions of the progenitor compact binary.
Here, for the first time, we obtain estimates for the detectability of the
first echo, using a perturbative description for the inspiral-merger-ringdown
waveform and a physically-motivated ECO reflectivity. Binaries with comparable
masses will have a stronger first echo, improving the chances of detection. For
a case like GW150914, the detection of the first echo will require a minimum
ringdown signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the range $\sim 20-60$. The most
optimistic scenario for echo detection could already be probed by LIGO in the
next years. With the expected improvements in sensitivity we estimate one or
two events per year to have the required SNR for the first echo detection
during O4.

we propose a novel family of nodal aggregation rules that aggregate node
features within a layer in a nonlinear state-space parametric fashion allowing
for a better trade-off. We develop two architectures within this family

  Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA) https://www.melba-journal.org",,,,"cs.CV stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the recent past, nested structures in Riemannian manifolds has been
studied in the context of dimensionality reduction as an alternative to the
popular principal geodesic analysis (PGA) technique, for example, the principal
nested spheres. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for constructing a
nested sequence of homogeneous Riemannian manifolds. Common examples of
homogeneous Riemannian manifolds include the $n$-sphere, the Stiefel manifold,
the Grassmann manifold and many others. In particular, we focus on applying the
proposed framework to the Grassmann manifold, giving rise to the nested
Grassmannians (NG). An important application in which Grassmann manifolds are
encountered is planar shape analysis. Specifically, each planar (2D) shape can
be represented as a point in the complex projective space which is a complex
Grass-mann manifold. Some salient features of our framework are: (i) it
explicitly exploits the geometry of the homogeneous Riemannian manifolds and
(ii) the nested lower-dimensional submanifolds need not be geodesic. With the
proposed NG structure, we develop algorithms for the supervised and
unsupervised dimensionality reduction problems respectively. The proposed
algorithms are compared with PGA via simulation studies and real data
experiments and are shown to achieve a higher ratio of expressed variance
compared to PGA.

an analog of the linearized Weyl tensor in F-theory, and $w^{4}$ is a shorthand

In addition to maintaining insights from existing approaches, Shapley Flow

advantage of its similarities with a mono-dimensional granular gas. Agents
interact as in the Deffuant model, with a parameter $\alpha$ controlling the
persuasibility of the individuals. The interaction coincides with the collision
rule of two grains moving on a line, provided opinions and velocities are
identified, with $\alpha$ being the so-called coefficient of normal
restitution. Starting from the master equation of the probability density of
all opinions, general conditions are given for the system to reach consensus.
The case when the interaction frequency is proportional to the $\beta$-power of
the relative opinions is studied in more detail. It is shown that the
mean-field approximation to the master equation leads to the Boltzmann kinetic
equation for the opinion distribution. In this case, the system always
approaches consensus, which can be seen as the approach to zero of the opinion
temperature, a measure of the width of the opinion distribution. Moreover, the
long-time behaviour of the system is characterized by a scaling solution to the
Boltzmann equation in which all time dependence occurs through the temperature.
The case $\beta=0$ is related to the Deffuant model and is analytically
soluble. The scaling distribution is unimodal and independent of $\alpha$. For
$\beta>0$ the distribution of opinions is unimodal below a critical value of
$|\alpha|$, being multimodal with two maxima above it. This means that agents
may approach consensus while being polarized. Near the critical points and for
$|\alpha|\ge 0.4$, the distribution of opinions is well approximated by the sum
of two Gaussian distributions. Monte Carlo simulations are in agreement with
the theoretical results.

constraints on the policy's behavior. However, just as learning has enabled
progress in large-scale development of AI systems, learning safety
specifications may also be necessary to ensure safety in messy open-world
environments where manual safety specifications cannot scale. Akin to how
humans learn incrementally starting in child-safe environments, we propose to
learn how to be safe in one set of tasks and environments, and then use that
learned intuition to constrain future behaviors when learning new, modified
tasks. We empirically study this form of safety-constrained transfer learning
in three challenging domains: simulated navigation, quadruped locomotion, and
dexterous in-hand manipulation. In comparison to standard deep RL techniques
and prior approaches to safe RL, we find that our method enables the learning
of new tasks and in new environments with both substantially fewer safety
incidents, such as falling or dropping an object, and faster, more stable
learning. This suggests a path forward not only for safer RL systems, but also
for more effective RL systems.

Thus, the design and evaluation of these models ultimately requires
understanding not only model accuracy but also the systems costs associated

paper develops a new framework and system that enables a joint evaluation of
both the conventional notions of machine learning performance (e.g., model
accuracy) and the systems-level costs of different representations of network

socioeconomic benefits depends heavily on improving general circulation model
based dynamical forecasting systems. To improve dynamical seasonal forecast, it
is crucial to set up forecast benchmarks, and clarify forecast limitations
posed by model initialization errors, formulation deficiencies, and internal
climate variability. With huge cost in generating large forecast ensembles, and
limited observations for forecast verification, the seasonal forecast
benchmarking and diagnosing task proves challenging. In this study, we develop
a probabilistic deep neural network model, drawing on a wealth of existing
climate simulations to enhance seasonal forecast capability and forecast
diagnosis. By leveraging complex physical relationships encoded in climate
simulations, our probabilistic forecast model demonstrates favorable
deterministic and probabilistic skill compared to state-of-the-art dynamical
forecast systems in quasi-global seasonal forecast of precipitation and
near-surface temperature. We apply this probabilistic forecast methodology to
quantify the impacts of initialization errors and model formulation
deficiencies in a dynamical seasonal forecasting system. We introduce the
saliency analysis approach to efficiently identify the key predictors that
influence seasonal variability. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling uncertainty
using variational Bayes, we give a more definitive answer to how the El
Nino/Southern Oscillation, the dominant mode of seasonal variability, modulates
global seasonal predictability.

GRUs have been widely deployed to solve time series learning tasks. These
networks train via Backpropagation Through Time, which can work well in
practice but involves a biologically unrealistic unrolling of the network in
time for gradient updates, are computationally expensive, and can be hard to
tune. A second paradigm, Reservoir Computing, keeps the recurrent weight matrix
fixed and random. Here, we propose a novel hybrid network, which we call Hybrid
Backpropagation Parallel Echo State Network (HBP-ESN) which combines the
effectiveness of learning random temporal features of reservoirs with the
readout power of a deep neural network with batch normalization. We demonstrate
that our new network outperforms LSTMs and GRUs, including multi-layer ""deep""
versions of these networks, on two complex real-world multi-dimensional time
series datasets: gesture recognition using skeleton keypoints from ChaLearn,
and the DEAP dataset for emotion recognition from EEG measurements. We show
also that the inclusion of a novel meta-ring structure, which we call HBP-ESN
M-Ring, achieves similar performance to one large reservoir while decreasing
the memory required by an order of magnitude. We thus offer this new hybrid
reservoir deep learning paradigm as a new alternative direction for RNN

quasi-localized rearrangements of particles. While many models of plasticity
exist, the precise relationship between plastic dynamics and the structure of a
particle's local environment remains an open question. Previously, machine
learning was used to identify a structural predictor of rearrangements, called
""softness."" Although softness has been shown to predict which particles will
rearrange with high accuracy, the method can be difficult to implement in
experiments where data is limited and the combinations of descriptors it
identifies are often difficult to interpret physically. Here we address both of
these weaknesses, presenting two major improvements to the standard softness
method. First, we present a natural representation of each particle's observed
mobility, allowing for the use of statistical models which are both simpler and
provide greater accuracy in limited data sets. Second, we employ persistent
homology as a systematic means of identifying simple, topologically-informed,
structural quantities that are easy to interpret and measure experimentally. We
test our methods on two-dimensional athermal packings of soft spheres under
quasi-static shear. We find that the same structural information which predicts
small variations in the response is also predictive of where plastic events
will localize. We also find that excellent accuracy is achieved in athermal
sheared packings using simply a particle's species and the number of nearest
neighbor contacts.

Brownian motion, and $\tau:= \inf\{t \ge 0: X(t) \le 0\}$ be the hitting time
to zero of a given process $X$. The first equation is $X(t) = X(0) + B(t) -
\alpha \mathbb{P}(\tau \le t)$. We provide a simple condition on $\alpha$ and
the distribution of $X(0)$ such that the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation
has no blow-up, and thus the McKean-Vlasov dynamics is well-defined for all
time $t \ge 0$. Our approach relies on a connection between the McKean-Vlasov
equation and the supercooled Stefan problem, as well as several comparison
principles. The second equation is $X(t) = X(0) + \beta t + B(t) + \alpha \log
\mathbb{P}(\tau > t)$, whose Fokker-Planck equation is non-local. We prove that
for $\beta > 0$ sufficiently large and $\alpha$ no greater than a sufficiently
small positive constant, there is no blow-up and the McKean-Vlasov dynamics is
well-defined for all time $t \ge 0$. The argument is based on a new transform,
which removes the non-local term, followed by a relative entropy analysis.

canonical equilibrium flows, there are no established definitions for general
non-equilibrium flows. In this work, a method is developed based on a local
reconstruction of the ""inviscid"" velocity profile $U_I[y]$ resulting from the
application of the Bernoulli equation in the wall-normal direction. The
boundary-layer thickness $\delta_{99}$ is then defined as the location where
$U/U_I = 0.99$, which is consistent with its classical definition for the
zero-pressure-gradient boundary layers (ZPGBLs). The proposed
local-reconstruction method is parameter free and can be deployed for both
internal and external flows without resorting to an iterative procedure,
numerical integration, or numerical differentiation. The superior performance
of the local-reconstruction method over various existing methods is
demonstrated by applying the methods to laminar and turbulent boundary layers
and two flows over airfoils. Numerical experiments reveal that the
local-reconstruction method is more accurate and more robust than existing
methods, and it is applicable for flows over a wide range of Reynolds numbers.

gradient descent can be applied almost verbatim to temporal difference
learning. Beyond giving a new, fuller explanation of why temporal difference
works, our interpretation also yields improved convergence times. We consider
the setting with $1/\sqrt{T}$ step-size, where previous comparable finite-time
convergence time bounds for temporal difference learning had the multiplicative
factor $1/(1-\gamma)$ in front of the bound, with $\gamma$ being the discount
factor. We show that a minor variation on TD learning which estimates the mean

again in 2019. We investigate its spectral properties in the hard intermediate
and the soft states with NuSTAR and Insight-HXMT. A reflection component has
been detected in the two spectral states but possibly originating from
different illumination spectra: in the intermediate state, the illuminating
source is attributed to a hard coronal component, which has been commonly
observed in other X-ray binaries, whereas in the soft state the reflection is
probably produced by the disk self-irradiation. Both cases support EXO 1846-031
as a low inclination system of ~40 degrees. An absorption line is clearly
detected at ~7.2 keV in the hard intermediate state, corresponding to a highly
ionized disk wind (log {\xi} > 6.1) with a velocity up to 0.06c. Meanwhile,
quasi-simultaneous radio emissions have been detected before and after the
X-rays, implying the co-existence of disk winds and jets in this system.
Additionally, the observed wind in this source is potentially driven by
magnetic forces. The absorption line disappeared in the soft state and a narrow
emission line appeared at ~6.7 keV on top of the reflection component, which
may be evidence for disk winds, but data with the higher spectral resolution
are required to examine this.

corresponding sample complexity is challenging and elusive, even for linear
time-varying (LTV) systems. To tackle this challenge, we develop an episodic
block model for the LTV system where the model parameters remain constant
within each block but change from block to block. Based on the observation that
the model parameters across different blocks are related, we treat each
episodic block as a learning task and then run meta-learning over many blocks
for system identification, using two steps, namely offline meta-learning and
online adaptation. We carry out a comprehensive non-asymptotic analysis of the
performance of meta-learning based system identification. To deal with the
technical challenges rooted in the sample correlation and small sample sizes in
each block, we devise a new two-scale martingale small-ball approach for
offline meta-learning, for arbitrary model correlation structure across blocks.
We then quantify the finite time error of online adaptation by leveraging
recent advances in linear stochastic approximation with correlated samples.

little is understood about how much MAML improves over NAL in terms of the fast

extending to 2014. Its full light curve shows a precursor event, followed by a
main superoutburst and at least two rebrightenings. A low-resolution spectrum
of this source points to a dwarf nova (DN) nature. Although some of the

the viscosity increase is coincident with that appearance of large

solid-like phases (SLPs) on spatial scales large compared to the particle size.
The critical strain for the appearance of SLPs is largely determined by the
peak oscillatory stress, which depends on the peak shear rate and the

Our method extends RRT-based sampling methods to enable the use of an assisting

  The cross-entropy loss has an information theoretic interpretation as
$S($True$) + D_{\mathrm{KL}}($True$||$Model$)$, and the empirical scaling laws
suggest a prediction for both the true data distribution's entropy and the KL
divergence between the true and model distributions. With this interpretation,
billion-parameter Transformers are nearly perfect models of the YFCC100M image

predict the asymptotic state of multistable systems when only sparse spatial
measurements of the system are feasible. Our method predicts the asymptotic
behavior of an observed state by quantifying its proximity to the states in a
precomputed library of data. To quantify this proximity, we introduce a
sparsity-promoting metric-learning (SPML) optimization, which learns a metric
directly from the precomputed data. The optimization problem is designed so
that the resulting optimal metric satisfies two important properties: (i) It is
compatible with the precomputed library, and (ii) It is computable from sparse
measurements. We prove that the proposed SPML optimization is convex, its
minimizer is non-degenerate, and it is equivariant with respect to scaling of
the constraints. We demonstrate the application of this method on two
multistable systems: a reaction-diffusion equation, arising in pattern
formation, which has four asymptotically stable steady states and a
FitzHugh-Nagumo model with two asymptotically stable steady states.
Classifications of the multistable reaction-diffusion equation based on SPML
predict the asymptotic behavior of initial conditions based on two-point
measurements with 95% accuracy when moderate number of labeled data are used.
For the FitzHugh-Nagumo, SPML predicts the asymptotic behavior of initial

metric also determines where the measurements need to be made to ensure
accurate predictions.

operation of the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-PARC) timing
system. However, among the many suspected modules, it has been difficult to
find the one with the fault. To find such a faulty module more easily, the
triggered scaler module, which was designed as a PLC-type I/O module, was
developed. This type of module requires the start signal of the J-PARC main
ring (MR) slow cycle (2.48/5.20 s) and the start signal of the rapid cycle (25
Hz) as reference signals, which are generated by the J-PARC timing system. A
scaler in the module counts the number of input pulses during a machine cycle,
and stores them in memory-buffers. In 2018, the module was evaluated using the
trigger for injection kicker and the low-level radio frequency (LLRF) signal of
J-PARC MR. The expected results were shown. In 2020, two applications were
developed based on a triggered scaler module. The first one, an application for
detecting unexpected-trigger events, successfully detected simulated
trigger-failure events. The second one, an application for the abort signal of
a machine protection system (MPS), showed that the module is capable of
visualizing signals based on a relationship with the accelerator cycle. Two
applications show possibilities for the development of more customized
applications in the future. An idea to develop a portable unexpected-trigger

evolution of spot distributions using 28 seasons of ground-based photometry, as

timescales on the star. We find that the $> 5$ m/s rms radial velocity
variations in HD 101501 are well-modeled with a GP stellar activity model
without planets, yielding a residual rms scatter of 45 cm/s. We carry out
simulations, injecting and recovering signals with the GP framework, to
demonstrate that high-cadence observations are required to use GPs most
efficiently to detect low-mass planets around active stars like HD 101501.
Sparse sampling prevents GPs from learning the correlated noise structure and
can allow it to absorb prospective Keplerian signals. We quantify the moderate
to high-cadence monitoring that provides the necessary information to
disentangle photospheric features using GPs and to detect planets around active

transitions in the immediate compact remnants of core collapse supernova,
neutron stars, and the theoretical models that describe the interior of dense

transition from hadronic matter to quark matter in the cores of these objects.
For the phase transition we will use two different formalisms: the Maxwell
formalism or abrupt phase transition and the Gibbs formalisms or mixed phase
transition. For the description of hadronic matter, we will use different
parametrizations of the relativistic mean field model with density-dependent
coupling constants. For the description of quark matter we will use an
effective nonlocal Nambu Jona-Lasinio model of three flavors with vector
interactions, in which we will include the possibility of formation of diquarks
to model a superconducting phase of color in $SU(3)$. Phase diagrams and
equations of state of quark matter at finite temperature are presented, and the
influence of that type of matter on observables associated with neutron stars
is investigated. The simplified thermal evolution of compact stars during their
formation is studied, from their state of proto-neutron stars to that of cold
neutron stars, and the results obtained are compared with recent astrophysical
observations. The results obtained indicate that the occurrence of quark matter
in the nuclei of these stars remains a promising possibility. The fact that the
use of more realistic models for the description of the dense matter in these
objects indicates the presence of quark matter inside neutron stars, could be
an answer to the question of the behavior of that kind of matter and the
determination of its corresponding equation of state.

for vapor liquid equilibrium (VLE) calculation with the van der Waals (vdW)
equation of state (EoS)[2]. The EAR generates an intermediate volume between
the saturated liquid and vapor volumes. The trajectory of the intermediate
volume over the coexistence region is defined here as the Maxwell crossover,
denoted as the M-line, which is independent of EoS. For the vdW or any cubic[3]
EoS, the intermediate volume corresponds to the unphysical root, while other
two corresponding to the saturated volumes of vapor and liquid phases,
respectively. Due to its unphysical nature, the intermediate volume has always
been discarded. Here we show that the M-line, which turns out to be strictly
related to the diameter[4] of the coexistence curve, holds the key to solving
several major issues. Traditionally the coexistence curve with two branches is
considered as the extension of the Widom line[5,6-9]. This assertion causes an
inconsistency in three planes of temperature, pressure and volume. It is found
that the M-line is the natural extension of the Widom line into the
vapor-liquid coexistence region. As a result, the united single line coherently
divides the entire phase space, including the coexistence and supercritical
fluid regions, into gas-like and liquid-like regimes in all the planes.
Moreover, along the M-line the vdW EoS finds a new perspective to access the
second-order transition in a way better aligning with observations and modern
theory[10]. Lastly, by using the feature of the M-line, we are able to derive a
highly accurate and analytical proximate solution to the VLE problem with the
vdW EoS.

of available datasets have actively been compensated by generating synthetic
data from realistic simulation environments and using those data to train deep

action simulation platform that can generate synthetic data on elders' daily
activities. For 55 kinds of frequent daily activities of the elders, ElderSim
generates realistic motions of synthetic characters with various adjustable
data-generating options, and provides different output modalities including RGB
videos, two- and three-dimensional skeleton trajectories. We then generate KIST
SynADL, a large-scale synthetic dataset of elders' activities of daily living,
from ElderSim and use the data in addition to real datasets to train three
state-of the-art human action recognition models. From the experiments
following several newly proposed scenarios that assume different real and

been hailed as a signpost of disk driven migration. Resonant chains like
Kepler-223 and Kepler-80 consist of a trio of planets with the three-body
resonant angle librating and/or with a two-body resonant angle librating for
each pair. Here we investigate whether close-in super-Earths and mini-Neptunes
forming in situ can lock into resonant chains due to dissipation from a
depleted gas disk. We simulate the giant impact phase of planet formation,
including eccentricity damping from a gaseous disk, followed by subsequent
dynamical evolution over tens of millions of years. In a fraction of simulated
systems, we find that planets naturally lock into resonant chains. These
planets achieve a chain of near-integer period ratios during the gas disk
stage, experience eccentricity damping that captures them into resonance, stay
in resonance as the gas disk dissipates, and avoid subsequent giant impacts,
eccentricity excitation, and chaotic diffusion that would dislodge the planets
from resonance. Disk conditions that enable planets to complete their formation
during the gas disk stage enable those planets to achieve tight period ratios
<= 2 and, if they happen to be near integer period ratios, lock into resonance.
Using the weighting of different disk conditions deduced by MacDonald et al.
(2020) and forward modeling Kepler selection effects, we find that our
simulations of in situ formation via oligarchic growth lead to a rate of
observable trios with integer period ratios and librating resonant angles
comparable to observed Kepler systems.

supporting emerging Internet of things (IoT) applications ranging from
real-time surveillance to edge machine learning. To this end, in this paper we
propose a resource allocation approach for uplink transmissions within a random
access procedure in MTC by exploiting multichannel selection diversity, coined
explore-before-talk (EBT). Each user in EBT first sends pilot signals through
multiple channels that are initially allocated by a base station (BS) for
exploration, and then the BS informs a subset of initially allocated channels
that are associated with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for data packet
transmission by the user while releasing the rest of the channels for other
users. Consequently, EBT exploits a multichannel selection diversity gain
during data packet transmission, at the cost of exploration during pilot
transmission. We optimize this exploration-exploitation trade-off, by deriving
closed-form mean data rate and resource outage probability expressions.
Numerical results corroborate that EBT achieves a higher mean data rate while
satisfying the same outage constraint, compared to a conventional MTC protocol
without exploration.

networks with free space optics (FSO) backhauling. The user equipment (UE)
communicates with the nearest Base Station (BS) in first slot while in second
slot, the BS converts the received radio frequency (RF) signal into FSO pulse
and transmits to the data center. We adopt the Rayleigh fading for the uplink
channels while the FSO backhaul encompasses the turbulence-induced fading which
follows the M\'alaga distribution, the weather pathloss, and the pointing
errors fading which is distributed following the generalized Beckmann model.
Further, we will compare the performances when the BS behaves as either a
decode-and-forward (DF) relay or an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS). Next,
we will propose an optimal design of the phase shifters of the IRS to minimize
the interference and improve the rate to beat relaying. Capitalizing on this
framework, we will derive the system performance metrics such as the coverage
probability as well as the spectral efficiency. Focusing on high SNR, we will
obtain the diversity gain to get engineering insights into the system
performance and limitations. Finally, the analytical results are confirmed by
Monte Carlo simulations.

  Cellular Networks",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The base station-mobile device communication traffic has dramatically
increased recently due to mobile data, which in turn heavily overloaded the
underlying infrastructure. To decrease Base Station (BS) interaction,
intra-cell communication between local devices, known as Device-to-Device, is
utilized for distributed data caching. Nevertheless, due to the continuous
departure of existing nodes and the arrival of newcomers, the missing cached
data may lead to permanent data loss. In this study, we propose and analyze a
class of LDPC codes for distributed data caching in cellular networks. Contrary
to traditional distributed storage, a novel repair algorithm for LDPC codes is
proposed which is designed to exploit the minimal direct BS communication. To
assess the versatility of LDPC codes and establish performance comparisons to
classic coding techniques, novel theoretical and experimental evaluations are
derived. Essentially, the theoretical/numerical results for repair bandwidth
cost in presence of BS are presented in a distributed caching setting.
Accordingly, when the gap between the cost of downloading a symbol from BS and
from other local network nodes is not dramatically high, we demonstrate that
LDPC codes can be considered as a viable fault-tolerance alternative in
cellular systems with caching capabilities for both low and high code rates.

segmentation masks identifying the contours of cells). This work proposes a
supervised learning framework based on classification-oriented convolutional

counting task as an image classification problem, where the cell counts are
taken as class labels. This formulation has its limitation when some cell

ordinal relation among cell counts is not utilized. To deal with these

also utilize the ordinal information to improve the prediction accuracy. This

However, it cannot capture the linguistic dependencies between the output
tokens. Inspired by the success of two-pass end-to-end models, we introduce a
transformer decoder and the two-stage inference method into the streaming CTC
model. During inference, the CTC decoder first generates many candidates in a

based on the corresponding acoustic encoded states. The second-stage
transformer decoder can be regarded as a conditional language model. We assume
that a large enough number and enough diversity of candidates generated in the

not as many are found in the context of the more ""modern"" sparse arrays. In
this paper, we present a novel blind calibration method for $2$-level nested
arrays. Specifically, and despite recent contradicting claims in the
literature, we show that the Least-Squares (LS) approach can in fact be used
for this purpose with such arrays. Moreover, the LS approach gives rise to
optimally-weighted LS joint estimation of the sensors' gains and phases
offsets, which leads to more accurate calibration, and in turn, to higher
accuracy in subsequent estimation tasks (e.g., direction-of-arrival). Our
method, which can be extended to $K$-level arrays ($K>2$), is superior to the
current state of the art both in terms of accuracy and computational
efficiency, as we demonstrate in simulation.

  We notice that the construction of Alman and Williams that disproves the

approximated with an error $n^{-\delta}$ by a linear space of dimension

low-rank tensors. This implies lower bounds for $\Theta_m$~ -- the error of
$m$-term approximation of multivariate functions by sums of tensor products

periodically in different manners, on the crackling dynamics of a brittle crack

considerably limit the magnitude of the largest events. Surprisingly, this does
not require information on the front loading state at the time of excitation;
applying it either at a random location or at the most loaded point gives the
same results. Subsequently, we unravel how the excitation amplitude, spatial

is ruled by a single reduced parameter, namely the injected power per unit
front length; the suppression of extreme avalanches is maximum at a
well-defined optimal value of this control parameter. This analysis opens a new
way to control largest events in crackling dynamics. Beyond fracture problems,
it may be relevant for crackling systems described by models of the same

contain single-center, single-phase, single-vendor, or single-disease cases,

main-sequence dwarf stars based on the Kepler DR25 planet candidate catalog and
Gaia-based stellar properties. We provide the first analysis in terms of
star-dependent instellation flux, which allows us to track HZ planets. We
define $\eta_\oplus$ as the HZ occurrence of planets with radius between 0.5
and 1.5 $R_\oplus$ orbiting stars with effective temperatures between 4800 K
and 6300 K. We find that $\eta_\oplus$ for the conservative HZ is between
$0.37^{+0.48}_{-0.21}$ (errors reflect 68\% credible intervals) and
$0.60^{+0.90}_{-0.36}$ planets per star, while the optimistic HZ occurrence is
between $0.58^{+0.73}_{-0.33}$ and $0.88^{+1.28}_{-0.51}$ planets per star.
These bounds reflect two extreme assumptions about the extrapolation of
completeness beyond orbital periods where DR25 completeness data are available.
The large uncertainties are due to the small number of detected small HZ
planets. We find similar occurrence rates using both a Poisson likelihood
Bayesian analysis and Approximate Bayesian Computation. Our results are
corrected for catalog completeness and reliability. Both completeness and the
planet occurrence rate are dependent on stellar effective temperature. We also
present occurrence rates for various stellar populations and planet size
ranges. We estimate with $95\%$ confidence that, on average, the nearest HZ

They are also attractive for endoscopic applications, offering the possibility
to achieve a similar information content as multicore fibers, but with a much
smaller footprint, thus reducing the invasiveness of endoscopic procedures.
However, these advances are hindered by the unavoidable presence of disorder
that affects the propagation of light in MMFs and limits their practical
applications. We introduce here a general framework to study and avoid the
effect of disorder. We experimentally find an almost complete set of optical
channels that are resilient to disorder induced by strong deformations. These
deformation principle modes are obtained by only exploiting measurements for
weak perturbations. We explain this effect by demonstrating that, even for a
high level of disorder, the propagation of light in MMFs can be characterized
by just a few key properties. These results are made possible thanks to a
precise and fast estimation of the modal transmission matrix of the fiber which
relies on a model-based optimization using deep learning frameworks.

approximation scheme of the model-checking problem for FO({>0}) that runs in

focusing on deterministic growth trees, our goal is to consider stochastic

introduced into the process of growing trees. As an immediate consequence, the
previously published results upon deterministic cases are thoroughly covered by
formulas established in this paper. Additionally, it is also straightforward to
obtain Kirchhoff index on our tree networks using the proposed approach. Most

carefully designed in EfficientNets. The giant formula for simultaneously
enlarging the resolution, depth and width provides us a Rubik's cube for neural
networks. So that we can find networks with high efficiency and excellent
performance by twisting the three dimensions. This paper aims to explore the
twisting rules for obtaining deep neural networks with minimum model sizes and
computational costs. Different from the network enlarging, we observe that
resolution and depth are more important than width for tiny networks.
Therefore, the original method, i.e., the compound scaling in EfficientNet is
no longer suitable. To this end, we summarize a tiny formula for downsizing
neural architectures through a series of smaller models derived from the
EfficientNet-B0 with the FLOPs constraint. Experimental results on the ImageNet
benchmark illustrate that our TinyNet performs much better than the smaller
version of EfficientNets using the inversed giant formula. For instance, our
TinyNet-E achieves a 59.9% Top-1 accuracy with only 24M FLOPs, which is about
1.9% higher than that of the previous best MobileNetV3 with similar

  In this paper we present work done in porting CASIM to GPUs via the directive
driven OpenACC and also modifying CASIM to take advantage of the Knights

specific computational kernels for offload to the GPU proved suboptimal and
instead the entire scheme was ported over to the GPU. We consider the

understand the best design and configuration. The performance of both versions
of CASIM, in comparison to the latest generation of CPUs is discussed, before
identifying lessons learnt about the suitability of CASIM and other similar

which show promising performance benefits when utilising both GPUs and KNLs and
enable the communities to take advantage of these technologies, in addition to

relativity that have been developed to account for some long standing issues in
our understanding of gravity. Some of these theories predict the existence of a
non-linear phenomenon, spontaneous scalarisation, which can lead to the
appearance of sizeable modifications to general relativity in the presence of
compact matter distributions, namely neutron stars. On the one hand, one of the
effects of the scalar field is to modify the emission of gravitational waves,
both due to variations in the quadrupolar deformation of the star and to the
presence of additional modes of emission. On the other hand, neutron stars are
known to harbour extremely powerful magnetic fields which can affect their
structure and shape, leading in turn to the emission of gravitational waves,
this time due to a magnetic quadrupolar deformation. We investigate here how
the presence of spontaneous scalarisation can affect the magnetic deformation
of neutron stars and their emission of quadrupolar gravitational waves, both of
tensor and scalar nature. We will show that it is possible to provide simple
parameterisations of the magnetic deformation and gravitational wave power of
neutron stars in terms of their baryonic mass, circumferential radius and
scalar charge, and that a universal scaling exists independently of the
magnetic field geometry and of the parameters of the scalar-tensor theory.

Window Approach (DWA) in terms of satisfying the robot's dynamics constraints
with state-of-the-art DRL-based navigation methods that can handle moving
obstacles and pedestrians well. Our formulation achieves these goals by
embedding the environmental obstacles' motions in a novel low-dimensional
observation space. It also uses a novel reward function to positively reinforce
velocities that move the robot away from the obstacle's heading direction
leading to significantly lower number of collisions. We evaluate our method in
realistic 3-D simulated environments and on a real differential drive robot in
challenging dense indoor scenarios with several walking pedestrians. We compare
our method with state-of-the-art collision avoidance methods and observe
significant improvements in terms of success rate (up to 33\% increase), number
of dynamics constraint violations (up to 61\% decrease), and smoothness. We
also conduct ablation studies to highlight the advantages of our observation
space formulation, and reward structure.

state-of-the-art deep stereo matching methods, in which 3D convolutions are
applied on a 4D feature volume to learn a 3D cost volume. However, this
mechanism has never been employed for the optical flow task. This is mainly due
to the significantly increased search dimension in the case of optical flow
computation, ie, a straightforward extension would require dense 4D
convolutions in order to process a 5D feature volume, which is computationally
prohibitive. This paper proposes a novel solution that is able to bypass the
requirement of building a 5D feature volume while still allowing the network to
learn suitable matching costs from data. Our key innovation is to decouple the
connection between 2D displacements and learn the matching costs at each 2D
displacement hypothesis independently, ie, displacement-invariant cost
learning. Specifically, we apply the same 2D convolution-based matching net
independently on each 2D displacement hypothesis to learn a 4D cost volume.
Moreover, we propose a displacement-aware projection layer to scale the learned
cost volume, which reconsiders the correlation between different displacement
candidates and mitigates the multi-modal problem in the learned cost volume.
The cost volume is then projected to optical flow estimation through a 2D
soft-argmin layer. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy on various datasets, and outperforms all published
optical flow methods on the Sintel benchmark.

both polynomials and trigonometric functions. In the existing literature, the

propagating and breaking over a fixed breaker bar. The simulations are
performed using a newly stabilized Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes (RANS)
two-equation turbulence closure, which solves the longstanding problem of
over-production of turbulence beneath surface waves in the nearly potential
flow region prior to breaking. This model has previously been tested on
small-scale spilling breaking regular waves, whereas in this work focus is on
full (rather than model) scale application, wave groups (rather than regular
waves) and plunging (rather than spilling) breakers. Additionally this paper
has novel emphasis on bottom boundary layer dynamics which are very important
for cross-shore sediment transport predictions. The model is validated by
comparing with results from a previous experimental campaign. The model is
shown to predict the surface elevations, velocities and turbulence well in the
shoaling and outer surf-zone, avoiding turbulence over-production and incorrect
undertow structure typical of standard turbulence closures. Comparison with
detailed boundary layer measurements in the shoaling position reveals that the
model is able to accurately capture the temporal dynamics of the entire wave
boundary layer, including evolution of the boundary layer thickness, velocity
overshoot and phase-shifts. Comparison in the surf zone additionally reveals
that the model is able to accurately capture the transport of breaking-induced
turbulence into the wave boundary layer. The performance of the model indicates
that it can be used directly in the simulation of cross-shore sediment
transport and morphology and also be used to study important hydrodynamic
processes, which can help improve the predictive skill of morphodynamic profile
models applied in coastal engineering.

  Entropies",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The central objective function of a variational autoencoder (VAE) is its
variational lower bound (the ELBO). Here we show that for standard (i.e.,
Gaussian) VAEs the ELBO converges to a value given by the sum of three
entropies: the (negative) entropy of the prior distribution, the expected
(negative) entropy of the observable distribution, and the average entropy of
the variational distributions (the latter is already part of the ELBO). Our
derived analytical results are exact and apply for small as well as for
intricate deep networks for encoder and decoder. Furthermore, they apply for
finitely and infinitely many data points and at any stationary point (including
local maxima and saddle points). The result implies that the ELBO can for
standard VAEs often be computed in closed-form at stationary points while the
original ELBO requires numerical approximations of integrals. As a main
contribution, we provide the proof that the ELBO for VAEs is at stationary
points equal to entropy sums. Numerical experiments then show that the obtained
analytical results are sufficiently precise also in those vicinities of
stationary points that are reached in practice. Furthermore, we discuss how the
novel entropy form of the ELBO can be used to analyze and understand learning
behavior. More generally, we believe that our contributions can be useful for
future theoretical and practical studies on VAE learning as they provide novel
information on those points in parameters space that optimization of VAEs
converges to.

buffering method, ORBBuf, to reduce the impact of data loss on remote visual

introducing a similarity metric between frames. To solve the buffering problem,
we present an efficient greedy-like algorithm to discard the frames that have
the least impact on the quality of SLAM results. We implement our ORBBuf method
on ROS, a widely used middleware framework. Through an extensive evaluation on
real-world scenarios and tens of gigabytes of datasets, we demonstrate that our
ORBBuf method can be applied to different state-estimation algorithms (DSO and
VINS-Fusion), different sensor data (both monocular images and stereo images),
different scenes (both indoor and outdoor), and different network environments

under the open boundary condition, the bounded-from-below nature of the Fock
space offers a unique setting for understanding and verifying non-Hermitian
skin modes under semi-infinity boundary conditions that are elusive in actual
physical lattices. A topological characterization based on the complex spectra
of the Liouvillian superoperator is proposed and the associated complete set of

complete bulk-boundary correspondence of point-gap topology generally absent in

for the first time a methodology to determine stellar abundances of elements
others than iron for M dwarf stars from high-resolution, optical spectra. Our
methodology is based on the use of principal component analysis and sparse
Bayesian's methods. We made use of a set of M dwarfs orbiting around an FGK
primary with known abundances to train our methods. We applied our methods to
derive stellar metalliticies and abundances of a large sample of M dwarfs
observed within the framework of current radial velocity surveys. We then used
a sample of nearby FGK stars to cross-validate our technique by comparing the
derived abundance trends in the M dwarf sample with those found on the FGK
stars. The metallicity distribution of the different subsamples shows that M
dwarfs hosting giant planets show a planet-metallicity correlation as well as a
correlation with the stellar mass. M dwarfs hosting low-mass planets do not
seem to follow the planet-metallicity correlation. We also found that the
frequency of low-mass planets does not depend on the mass of the stellar host.
These results seem in agreement with previous works. However, we note that for
giant planet hosts our metallicities predict a weaker planet metallicity
correlation but a stronger mass-dependency than photometric values. We show,
for the first time, that there seems to be no differences in the abundance
distribution of elements different from iron between M dwarfs with and without
known planets. Our data shows that low-mass stars with planets follow the same
metallicity, mass, and abundance trends than their FGK counterparts.

synchronization requires an understanding of the global unsteady flows around
oscillating bodies. Yet, there has been no precise experimental test on the
microscale of the most basic aspects of such unsteady Stokes flow: the orbits
of passive tracers and the position-dependent phase lag between the oscillating
response of the fluid at a distant point and that of the driving particle.
Here, we report the first such direct Lagrangian measurement of this unsteady
flow. The method uses an array of $30$ submicron tracer particles positioned by
a time-shared optical trap at a range of distances and angular positions with
respect to a larger, central particle, which is then driven by an oscillating
optical trap at frequencies up to $400$ Hz. In this microscale regime, the
tracer dynamics is considerably simplified by the smallness of both inertial
effects on particle motion and finite-frequency corrections to the Stokes drag
law. The tracers are found to display elliptical Lissajous figures whose
orientation and geometry are in agreement with a low-frequency expansion of the
underlying dynamics, and the experimental phase shift between motion parallel

distance and angle. Possible implications of these results for synchronization

These values are below the Eddington limit for star formation, but similar to
those found in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies. The SFRDs drop toward
larger radii by an order of magnitude. Likewise, the [CII]/FIR luminosity
ratios of the quasar hosts are lowest in their centers (few x10^-4) and
increase by a factor of a few toward the galaxies' outskirts, consistent with
resolved studies of lower-redshift sources.

length of 2kpc, detected up to ~10kpc. The surface brightness of the extended

constitutes 10-20% of the total measured flux density. Although the central
component of the dust continuum emission is more compact than that of the [CII]

extended components are consistent with those predicted by hydrodynamical
simulations of galaxies with similar infrared luminosities, where the dust
emission is powered by star formation. The [CII] spectrum measured in the mean

epidemiological models to predict the course of the epidemic so as to help
planning effective control strategies. In particular, in order to properly
interpret the available data, it has become clear that one must go beyond most
classic epidemiological models and consider models that, like the recently
proposed SIDARTHE, offer a richer description of the stages of infection. The
problem of learning the parameters of these models is of crucial importance
especially when assuming that they are time-variant, which further enriches
their effectiveness. In this paper we propose a general approach for learning
time-variant parameters of dynamic compartmental models from epidemic data. We
formulate the problem in terms of a functional risk that depends on the
learning variables through the solutions of a dynamic system. The resulting
variational problem is then solved by using a gradient flow on a suitable,
regularized functional. We forecast the epidemic evolution in Italy and France.
Results indicate that the model provides reliable and challenging predictions
over all available data as well as the fundamental role of the chosen strategy
on the time-variant parameters.

anode materials in lithium-ion batteries and sodium-ion batteries, it possesses
a high energy storage capacity (960.23 mAhg$^{-1}$), surpassing the traditional

view of a reconstruction of the incident photon flux in the regime of highly
non-linear response. SiPMs are semiconductor based light detectors compiled of
avalanche photodiodes operated in Geiger mode. They are both mechanically and
optically very robust and have a high gain and photon detection efficiency.
These features make them ideal photonsensors in a wide range of applications
and they are nowadays replacing conventional photomultiplier tubes in many
experiments. The cellular structure of SiPMs where each cell can only detect
one photon at a time results in a non-linear dynamic range limiting the
possible applications.
  We studied a commonly used SiPM model based on an equivalent electronic
circuit that allows the simulation of the SiPM response in many situations.
Dedicated measurements with two consecutive light pulses prove its
applicability. By adapting the model to the measurements, intrinsic parameters
of the SiPM such as quenching resistance or diode capacitance can be
determined. With the obtained intrinsic parameters, the model correctly
describes the recharge behavior of the SiPM cells.
  Based on the model, an algorithm was developed to correct the non-linearity
of the dynamic range of SiPMs. As the model contains full information on the
recharge of the SiPM cells, the effects leading to the non-linearity can be
corrected for. The algorithm exploits the time information in the measured
voltage signal and reconstructs the number of incident photons. It has shown an
excellent performance and allows to increase the dynamic range with only 10%
deviation from linearity by at least two orders of magnitude.

uncertainties in manufacturing processes and often lead to product quality
issues. Failing to model the effect object shape errors, i.e., geometric and
dimensional errors of parts, early during design phase inhibits the ability to
predict such quality issues; consequently leading to expensive design changes
after freezing of design. State-of-Art methodologies for modelling and
simulating object shape error have limited defect fidelity, data versatility,
and designer centricity that prevent their effective application during early
design phase. Overcoming these limitations a novel Morphing Gaussian Random
Field (MGRF) methodology for object shape error modelling and simulation is
presented in this paper. The MGRF methodology has (i) high defect fidelity and
is capable of simulating various part defects including local and global
deformations, and technological patterns; (ii) high data versatility and can
effectively simulate non-ideal parts under the constraint of limited data
availability and can utilise historical non-ideal part data; (iii) designer
centric capabilities such as performing `what if?' analysis of practically
relevant defects; and (iv) capability to generate non-ideal parts conforming to
statistical form tolerance specification. The aforementioned capabilities
enable MGRF methodology to accurately model and simulate the effect of object
shape variations on product quality during the early design phase. This is
achieved by first, modelling the spatial correlation in the deviations of the
part from its design nominal using Gaussian Random Field and then, utilising
the modelled spatial correlations to generate non-ideal parts by conditional
simulations. Practical applications of developed MGRF methodology and its
advantages are demonstrated using sport-utility-vehicle door parts.

the frequency response undergoes a local maximum (amplitude resonance) or phase
lag quadrature takes places (phase resonance). This study focuses on the phase
resonance of nonlinear mechanical systems subjected to single-point,
single-harmonic excitation. In this context, the main contribution of this
paper is to develop a computational framework which can predict the mode shapes
and oscillation frequencies at phase resonance. The resulting nonlinear modes
are termed phase resonance nonlinear modes (PRNMs). A key property of PRNMs is
that, besides primary resonances, they can accurately characterize
superharmonic, subharmonic and ultra-subharmonic resonances for which, as shall
be shown in this paper, phase lags at resonance may be different from pi/2. The
proposed developments are demonstrated using one- and two-degree-of-freedom
systems featuring a cubic nonlinearity.

the one, a lifetime for the other. These two processes, the basis of much of
life on earth, interact in many non-trivial ways, but their temporal hierarchy
-- evolution overarching development -- is observed for most multicellular
lifeforms. When designing robots however, this tenet lifts: it becomes --
however natural -- a design choice. We propose to inverse this temporal
hierarchy and design a developmental process happening at the phylogenetic
timescale. Over a classic evolutionary search aimed at finding good gaits for
tentacle 2D robots, we add a developmental process over the robots'
morphologies. Within a generation, the morphology of the robots does not
change. But from one generation to the next, the morphology develops. Much like
we become bigger, stronger, and heavier as we age, our robots are bigger,
stronger and heavier with each passing generation. Our robots start with baby
morphologies, and a few thousand generations later, end-up with adult ones. We
show that this produces better and qualitatively different gaits than an
evolutionary search with only adult robots, and that it prevents premature
convergence by fostering exploration. In addition, we validate our method on
voxel lattice 3D robots from the literature and compare it to a recent
evolutionary developmental approach. Our method is conceptually simple, and can
be effective on small or large populations of robots, and intrinsic to the
robot and its morphology, not the task or environment. Furthermore, by
recasting the evolutionary search as a learning process, these results can be
viewed in the context of developmental learning robotics.

1:2.2, separated by $\sim$720 kpc. The X-ray emission peak is offcentred from
the south DM peak by $\sim$350 kpc. Using N-body hydrodynamical simulations, we
aim to reconstruct the dynamic history of the collision, reproducing the
observed features, and also to explore the conditions that led to the
dissociation. Our best model assuming that the collision is close to the plane
of the sky, with a small impact parameter, observed 0.26 Gyr after central

strongly depends on the size of the conducting plates and can be substantially

L\'evy noise are derived as well as the amount of smoothing to ensure such

pathwise existence and measurability of solutions to the random boundary value
problem (BVP). For the solutions of the BVP we prove existence of moments (in
the $H^1$-norm) under adequate growth conditions on the L\'evy measure of the

introduced and convergence in $L^n$ ($n\geq 1$) of the solutions associated

making it a dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) candidate. Our new 15 GHz VLA
observations reveal that S1 is a double radio source centred around the optical
nucleus; its total extent is ~750 parsec and its average 1.4-8.5 GHz spectral
index is -0.81 +/- 0.06. S1 therefore, resembles a compact symmetric object
(CSO). The 15 GHz VLA image identifies the radio source at S2 to be a compact
core. Our radio observations therefore strongly support the presence of a dual
AGN in Mrk 212. The optical emission line flux ratios obtained from the
Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) observations however, show that S1 and S2
both fall in the AGN + SF (star formation) region of the BPT diagram. Weak AGN
lying in the SF or AGN + SF intermediate regions in the BPT diagram have indeed
been reported in the literature; our sources clearly fall in the same category.

finite or countably infinite, has to find an inert target (treasure) hidden in
one of the nodes. This task is known as treasure hunt. The agent has no a
priori knowledge of the graph, of the location of the treasure or of the
initial distance to it. The cost of a treasure hunt algorithm is the worst-case
number of edge traversals performed by the agent until finding the treasure.
Awerbuch, Betke, Rivest and Singh [3] considered graph exploration and treasure
hunt for finite graphs in a restricted model where the agent has a fuel tank
that can be replenished only at the starting node $s$. The size of the tank is
$B=2(1+\alpha)r$, for some positive real constant $\alpha$, where $r$, called
the radius of the graph, is the maximum distance from $s$ to any other node.
The tank of size $B$ allows the agent to make at most $\lfloor B\rfloor$ edge
traversals between two consecutive visits at node $s$.
  Let $e(d)$ be the number of edges whose at least one extremity is at distance
less than $d$ from $s$. Awerbuch, Betke, Rivest and Singh [3] conjectured that
it is impossible to find a treasure hidden in a node at distance at most $d$ at
cost nearly linear in $e(d)$. We first design a deterministic treasure hunt
algorithm working in the model without any restrictions on the moves of the
agent at cost $\mathcal{O}(e(d) \log d)$, and then show how to modify this
algorithm to work in the model from [3] with the same complexity. Thus we
refute the above twenty-year-old conjecture. We observe that no treasure hunt
algorithm can beat cost $\Theta(e(d))$ for all graphs and thus our algorithms
are also almost optimal.

which by adding to a natural image can fool a respective model with high
confidence. Recently, the existence of image-agnostic perturbations, also known
as universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), were discovered. However,
existing UAPs still lack a sufficiently high fooling rate, when being applied
to an unknown target model. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning
technique for generating more transferable UAPs. We utilize a perturbation
generator and some given pretrained networks so-called source models to
generate UAPs using the ImageNet dataset. Due to the similar feature
representation of various model architectures in the first layer, we propose a
loss formulation that focuses on the adversarial energy only in the respective
first layer of the source models. This supports the transferability of our
generated UAPs to any other target model. We further empirically analyze our
generated UAPs and demonstrate that these perturbations generalize very well
towards different target models. Surpassing the current state of the art in
both, fooling rate and model-transferability, we can show the superiority of
our proposed approach. Using our generated non-targeted UAPs, we obtain an
average fooling rate of 93.36% on the source models (state of the art: 82.16%).
Generating our UAPs on the deep ResNet-152, we obtain about a 12% absolute
fooling rate advantage vs. cutting-edge methods on VGG-16 and VGG-19 target

text in another language via an end-to-end way. Most existing methods employ an
encoder-decoder structure with a single encoder to learn acoustic
representation and semantic information simultaneously, which ignores the
speech-and-text modality differences and makes the encoder overloaded, leading
to great difficulty in learning such a model. To address these issues, we
propose a Speech-to-Text Adaptation for Speech Translation (STAST) model which
aims to improve the end-to-end model performance by bridging the modality gap
between speech and text. Specifically, we decouple the speech translation
encoder into three parts and introduce a shrink mechanism to match the length
of speech representation with that of the corresponding text transcription. To
obtain better semantic representation, we completely integrate a text-based
translation model into the STAST so that two tasks can be trained in the same
latent space. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-modal adaptation method to
close the distance between speech and text representation. Experimental results
on English-French and English-German speech translation corpora have shown that
our model significantly outperforms strong baselines, and achieves the new
state-of-the-art performance.

directly driven under quiet conditions over 13 min. This flow channel
contributed to a significant fraction (60%) of the cross polar cap potential

that the performance of NPl LEDs is primarily hindered by a poor electronic

remarkably deep ionization potentials (>=6.5 eV), leading to large barriers for

two different waveguide QED lattices, namely a chain of qubits with direct
coupling between the nearest neighbors and a chain of connected resonators to
each of which a qubit is side-coupled. We apply an efficient truncated
Heisenberg-Langevin equations method to show loss of coherent light
transmission with increasing intensity in these lattices due to effective
photon-photon interactions and related photon blockade mediated by nonlinearity
in qubits. In contrast to the direct-coupled qubits, we find a revival in the
coherent light transmission in the side-coupled qubits at relatively higher
intensities due to saturation of qubits by photons. We further study these
lattices within the quasi-classical approximation, which fails for a broad set
of parameters. We then devise a technique to modify the quasi-classical
analysis to give much better results. Lastly, we examine light propagation in
an inhomogeneous lattice of side-coupled qubits and observe non-monotonicity in
light transmission with increasing light intensity.

of curves on $M$ in the directions specified by $\mathcal C$. There are two
common sources of cone structures and conic connections, one in differential
geometry and another in algebraic geometry. In differential geometry, we have
cone structures induced by the geometric structures underlying holomorphic
parabolic geometries, a classical example of which is the null cone bundle of a
holomorphic conformal structure. In algebraic geometry, we have the cone
structures consisting of varieties of minimal rational tangents (VMRT) given by
minimal rational curves on uniruled projective manifolds. The local invariants
of the cone structures in parabolic geometries are given by the curvature of
the parabolic geometries, the nature of which depend on the type of the
parabolic geometry, i.e., the type of the fibers of $\mathcal C \to M$. For the
VMRT-structures, more intrinsic invariants of the conic connections which do
not depend on the type of the fiber play important roles. We study the relation
between these two different aspects for the cone structures induced by
parabolic geometries associated with a long simple root of a complex simple Lie
algebra. As an application, we obtain a local differential-geometric version of
the global algebraic-geometric recognition theorem due to Mok and Hong--Hwang.
In our local version, the role of rational curves is completely replaced by
appropriate torsion conditions on the conic connection.

topic, which plays a vital role in quantum algorithm verification,
error-tolerant verification and other applications. Tensor network contraction
based on density matrix is an important single-amplitude simulation strategy,
but it is hard to execute on the distributed computing systems currently. In
this paper, we dive deep into this problem, and propose a scheme based on
cutting edges of undirected graphs. This scheme cuts edges of undirected graphs
with large tree width to obtain many undirected subgraphs with small tree
width, and these subgraphs contracted on different computing cores. The
contraction results of slave cores are summarized in the master node, which is
consistent with the original tensor network contraction. Thus, we can simulate
the larger scale quantum circuit than single core. Moreover, it's an NP-hard
problem to find the global optimum cutting edges, and we propose a search
strategy based on a heuristic algorithm to approach it. In order to verify the
effectiveness of our scheme, we conduct tests based on QAOA algorithm, and it
can simulate 120-qubit 3-regular QAOA algorithm on 4096-core supercomputer,
which greatly exceeds the simulation scale on a single core of 100-qubit.

thin, spherically symmetric shells which can be used to probe the mass loss
history of their host stars. We aim to determine the physical properties of the
dust envelope around the two carbon stars U Hya and W Ori. With the
much-improved spatial constraints from the new far-infrared maps, our primary
goal is to measure the dust masses contained in the shells and see how they fit
the proposed scenarios of shell formation. We calculated the radiative transfer
of the circumstellar dust envelope using the 1D code More of DUSTY (MoD).
Adopting a parametrised density profile, we obtained a best-fit model in terms
of the photometric and spectroscopic data, as well as a radial intensity
profile based on Herschel/PACS data. For the case of U Hya, we also computed a
grid of circumstellar envelopes by means of a stationary wind code and compare
the results of the two modelling approaches. The Herschel/PACS maps show U Hya
surrounded by a detached shell of $114''\ (0.12\,\mathrm{pc})$ in radius,
confirming the observations from previous space missions. The dust masses
calculated for the shell by the two approaches are consistent with respect to
the adopted dust grain properties. In addition, around W Ori, we detect for the
first time a weak spherically symmetric structure with a radius of $92''\

feature renders the cosmological model statistically comparable, on equal

acoustic oscillation, redshift space distortions, Big Bang nucleosynthesis and
the cosmic microwave background constraint on the decoupling acoustic scale --
we show that, although the exponential infrared-corrected gravity and
$\Lambda$CDM are physically different, they are phenomenologically and

classification model were developed for linear programming. Intelligent
behaviour appeared in a decision process can be treated as a point y, the
dynamic state observed and controlled by the agent, moving in a factor space
impelled by the goal factor and blocked by the constraint factors. Suppose that
the feasible region is cut by a group of hyperplanes, when point y reaches the
region's wall, a hyperplane will block the moving and the agent needs to adjust
the moving direction such that the target is pursued as faithful as possible.
Since the wall is not able to be represented to a differentiable function, the
gradient method cannot be applied to describe the adjusting process. We,
therefore, suggest a new model, named linear adjusting programming (LAP) in
this paper. LAP is similar as a kind of relaxed linear programming (LP), and
the difference between LP and LAP is: the former aims to find out the ultimate
optimal point, while the latter just does a direct action in short period. You
may ask: Where will a blocker encounter? How can the moving direction be
adjusted? Where further blockers may be encountered next, and how should the
direction be adjusted again? We request at least an adjusting should be
achieved at the first time. If a hyperplane blocks y going ahead along with the
direction d, then we must adjust the new direction d' as the projection of g in
the blocking plane. If there is only one blocker at a time, it is
straightforward to calculate the projection, but how to calculate the
projection when there are more than one blocker encountered simultaneously? We
suggest a projection calculation by means of the Hat matrix in this paper.
Linear adjusting programming will attract interest in many fields. It might
bring a new light to solve the linear programming problem with a strong
polynomial solution.

properties remain poorly understood due to the limited spatial resolution of
the observations. We aim to explore and analyze the physical properties of
small-scale vortices inside magnetic flux tubes using numerical simulations,
and to investigate whether they contribute to heating the chromosphere in a
plage region. Using the three-dimensional (3D) radiative magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) simulation code 'MURaM', we perform numerical simulations of a unipolar
solar plage region. To detect and isolate vortices, we use the Swirling
Strength criterion and select the locations where the fluid is rotating with an
angular velocity greater than a certain threshold. We concentrate on
small-scale as they are the strongest and carry most of the energy. We explore
the spatial profiles of physical quantities viz. density, horizontal velocity,
etc. inside these vortices. Moreover, to apprehend their general
characteristics, a statistical investigation is performed. Magnetic flux tubes
have a complex filamentary substructure harbouring an abundance of small-scale
vortices. At the interfaces between vortices strong current sheets are formed
that may dissipate and heat the solar chromosphere. Statistically, vortices
have higher densities and higher temperatures than the average values at the
same geometrical height in the chromosphere. We conclude that small-scale
vortices are ubiquitous in solar plage regions, and they are denser and hotter
structures that contribute to chromospheric heating, possibly by dissipation of
the current sheets formed at their interfaces.

the result of elementary interactions which involve more than two constituents,
so that their description has unavoidably to go beyond simple
pairwise-relationships. Simplicial complexes are therefore the mathematical
objects providing a faithful representation of such systems. We here present a
complete theory of synchronization of $D$-dimensional oscillators obeying an
extended Kuramoto model, and interacting by means of 1- and 2- simplices. Not
only our theory fully describes and unveils the intimate reasons and mechanisms
for what was observed so far with pairwise interactions, but it also offers
predictions for a series of rich and novel behaviors in simplicial structures,
which include: a) a discontinuous de-synchronization transition at positive
values of the coupling strength for all dimensions, b) an extra discontinuous
transition at zero coupling for all odd dimensions, and c) the occurrence of
partially synchronized states at $D=2$ (and all odd $D$) even for negative
values of the coupling strength, a feature which is inherently prohibited with
pairwise-interactions. Furthermore, our theory untangles several aspects of the
emergent behavior: the system can never fully synchronize from disorder, and is
characterized by an extreme multi-stability, in that the asymptotic stationary
synchronized states depend always on the initial conditions. All our
theoretical predictions are fully corroborated by extensive numerical
simulations. Our results elucidate the dramatic and novel effects that
higher-order interactions may induce in the collective dynamics of ensembles of
coupled $D$-dimensional oscillators, and can therefore be of value and interest
for the understanding of many phenomena observed in nature, like for instance
the swarming and/or flocking processes unfolding in three or more dimensions.

achieved great success in estimating tropical cyclone (TC) intensity based on
satellite data with fixed temporal frequency (e.g., 3 h). However, to achieve
more timely (under 30 min) and accurate TC intensity estimates, a deep learning
model is demanded to handle temporally-heterogeneous satellite observations.
Specifically, infrared (IR1) and water vapor (WV) images are available under
every 15 minutes, while passive microwave rain rate (PMW) is available for
about every 3 hours. Meanwhile, the visible (VIS) channel is severely affected
by noise and sunlight intensity, making it difficult to be utilized. Therefore,
we propose a novel framework that combines generative adversarial network (GAN)
with CNN. The model utilizes all data, including VIS and PMW information,
during the training phase and eventually uses only the high-frequent IR1 and WV
data for providing intensity estimates during the predicting phase.
Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid GAN-CNN framework achieves
comparable precision to the state-of-the-art models, while possessing the
capability of increasing the maximum estimation frequency from 3 hours to less

dataset that features several real-world challenges: Toyota Smarthome Untrimmed
(TSU). TSU contains a wide variety of activities performed in a spontaneous
manner. The dataset contains dense annotations including elementary, composite
activities and activities involving interactions with objects. We provide an
analysis of the real-world challenges featured by our dataset, highlighting the
open issues for detection algorithms. We show that current state-of-the-art
methods fail to achieve satisfactory performance on the TSU dataset. Therefore,
we propose a new baseline method for activity detection to tackle the novel
challenges provided by our dataset. This method leverages one modality (i.e.
optic flow) to generate the attention weights to guide another modality (i.e
RGB) to better detect the activity boundaries. This is particularly beneficial
to detect activities characterized by high temporal variance. We show that the
method we propose outperforms state-of-the-art methods on TSU and on another
popular challenging dataset, Charades.

  granular gripper","5 pages, 6 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft physics.app-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  A granular gripper is a device used to hold objects by taking advantage of
the phenomenon of Reynold's dilatancy. A membrane containing a granular sample
is allowed to deform around the object to be held and then vacuum is used to
jam the granular material inside the membrane. This allows to hold the object
against external forces since deformation of the granular material is prevented
by not allowing the system to increase its volume. The maximum holding force
supported by the gripper depends on a number of variables. In this work, we
show that in the regime of frictional holding (where the gripper does not
interlock with the object), the maximum holding force does not depend on the
granular material used to fill the membrane. Results for a variety of granular
materials can be collapsed into a single curve if maximum holding force is
plotted against the penetration depth achieved. The results suggest that the
most important feature in selecting a particular granular material is its
deformability to ensure an easy flow during the initial phase of the gripping
process.

Lyapunov exponent can be written as an additive functional of the associated
Riccati process submitted to some Langevin dynamics on the infinite periodic
ring. Its large deviations properties can be thus analyzed from two points of
view that are equivalent in the end by consistency but give different
perspectives. In the first approach, one starts from the large deviations at
level 2.5 for the joint probability of the empirical density and of the
empirical current of the Riccati process and one performs the appropriate
Euler-Lagrange optimization in order to compute the cumulant generating
function of the Lyapunov exponent. In the second approach, this cumulant
generating function is obtained from the spectral analysis of the appropriate
tilted Fokker-Planck operator. The associated conditioned process obtained via
the generalization of Doob's h-transform allows to clarify the equivalence with
the first approach. Finally, applications to one-dimensional Anderson
Localization models are described in order to obtain explicitly the first
cumulants of the finite-size Lyapunov exponent.

These backgrounds are chiral, asymptotically flat gauge fields characterised by
their free radiative data, and their underlying integrability is captured by
twistor theory. Tree-level gluon scattering scattering amplitudes are expressed
as integrals over the moduli space of holomorphic maps from the Riemann sphere
to twistor space, with the degree of the map related to the helicity
configuration of the external gluons. In the MHV sector, our formula is derived
from the Yang-Mills action; for general helicities the formulae are obtained
using a background-coupled twistor string theory and pass several consistency
tests. Unlike amplitudes on a trivial vacuum, there are residual integrals due
to the functional freedom in the self-dual background, but for scattering of
momentum eigenstates we are able to do many of these explicitly and even more
is possible in the special case of plane wave backgrounds. In general, the
number of these integrals is always less than expected from standard
perturbation theory, but matches the number associated with space-time MHV
rules in a self-dual background field, which we develop for self-dual plane

Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) camera equipped with a linear polarizing filter. A
method was developed to combine images acquired with 15 different exposure
times (from 1/4000 sec to 4 sec), identifying in each pixel the best interval
of detector linearity. The resulting mosaic image of the solar corona extends
up to more than 5 solar radii, with a projected pixel size by 3.7 arcsec/pixel,
and an effective image resolution by 10.2 arcsecs, as determined with visible
$\alpha-$Leo and $\nu-$Leo stars. Image analysis shows that in the inner corona
the intensity gradients are so steep, that nearby pixels shows a relative
intensity difference by up to $\sim 10 \%$; this implies that careful must be
taken when analyzing single exposures acquired with polarization cameras.
  Images acquired with two different orientations of the polarizer have been
analyzed to derive the degree of linear polarization, and the polarized
brightness $pB$ in the solar corona. After inter-calibration with $pB$

generalizability to unseen spoofing attacks. This work proposes to leverage a
novel model structure, so-called Res2Net, to improve the anti-spoofing
countermeasure's generalizability. Res2Net mainly modifies the ResNet block to
enable multiple feature scales. Specifically, it splits the feature maps within
one block into multiple channel groups and designs a residual-like connection
across different channel groups. Such connection increases the possible
receptive fields, resulting in multiple feature scales. This multiple scaling
mechanism significantly improves the countermeasure's generalizability to
unseen spoofing attacks. It also decreases the model size compared to
ResNet-based models. Experimental results show that the Res2Net model
consistently outperforms ResNet34 and ResNet50 by a large margin in both

Moreover, integration with the squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block can further
enhance performance. For feature engineering, we investigate the

J1004+4112. The microlensed quasar images appear to lie well clear of the
stellar population of the cluster, raising the possibility that the cluster
dark matter is composed of compact bodies which are responsible for the
observed microlensing. In the first part of the paper we establish the exact
structure of the difference light curves attributed to microlensing from
photometric monitoring programmes in the literature. We then show from measures
of surface brightness that the probability of microlensing by stars in the
cluster is negligibly small. Finally we relax our assumption that the cluster
dark matter is in the form of smoothly distributed particles, but instead is
made up of compact bodies. We then use computer simulations of the resulting
magnification pattern to estimate the probability of microlensing. Our results
show that for a range of values for source size and lens mass the observed
large microlensing amplitude is consistent with the statistics from the
simulations. We conclude that providing the assumption of smoothly distributed
dark matter is relaxed, the observed large amplitude microlensing can be
accounted for by allowing the cluster dark matter to be in the form of solar
mass compact bodies. We further conclude that the most plausible identity for
these bodies is primordial black holes.

frames with bounded conformal factor provided the integral of $|\boldsymbol
A|^2$, the squared-length of the second fundamental form, is less than
$\gamma_n=8\pi$. It has since been shown that the optimal bounds on the
integral of $|\boldsymbol A|^2$ that guarantee this result are: $\gamma_3 =
8\pi$ and $\gamma_n = 4\pi$ for $n \geq 4$. For isothermal immersions, this
hypothesis is equivalent to saying the integral of the sum of the squares of
the principal curvatures is less than $\gamma_n$. The goal here is to prove
that when $n=3$ the same conclusion holds under weaker hypotheses. In
particular, it holds for isothermal immersions when $|\boldsymbol A|$ is
square-integrable and the integral of $|K|$, $K$ the Gauss curvature, is less
than $4\pi$. Since $2|K| \leq |\boldsymbol A|^2$ this implies the known result
for isothermal immersions, but $|K|$ may be small when $|\boldsymbol A|^2$ is
large. That the result under the weaker hypothesis is sharp is shown by
Enneper's surface and stereographic projections. The method, which is purely
analytic, is then extended to investigate the case when the length of the

of urca nuclei in the neutron star crust. Nuclear isobars harboring urca
nuclides can be produced in the ashes of Type I X-ray bursts, but the details
of their production have not yet been explored. Using the code {\tt MESA}, we
investigate urca nuclide production in a one-dimensional model of Type I X-ray
bursts using astrophysical conditions thought to resemble the source GS
1826-24. We find that high-mass ($A\geq55$) urca nuclei are primarily produced
late in the X-ray burst, during hydrogen-burning freeze-out that corresponds to
the tail of the burst light curve. The $\sim0.4$--0.6~GK temperature relevant
for nucleosynthesis of these urca nuclides is much lower than the $\sim1$~GK
temperature most relevant for X-ray burst light curve impacts by nuclear
reaction rates involving high-mass nuclides. The latter temperature is often
assumed for nuclear physics studies. Therefore, our findings alter the
excitation energy range of interest in compound nuclei for nuclear physics
studies of urca nuclide production. We demonstrate that for some cases this
will need to be considered in planning for nuclear physics experiments.
Additionally, we show that the lower temperature range for urca nuclide
production explains why variations of some nuclear reaction rates in model
calculations impacts the burst light curve but not local features of the burst
ashes.

counterfactual outcome based on static data. However, many applications have
time-varying confounding effects such as multiple treatments over time. How to
model such time-varying effects from longitudinal observational data? How to
model complex high-dimensional dependency in the data? To address these
challenges, we propose Deep Recurrent Inverse TreatmEnt weighting (DeepRite) by
incorporating recurrent neural networks into two-phase adjustments for the
existence of time-varying confounding in modern longitudinal data. In phase I
cohort reweighting we fit one network for emitting time dependent inverse
probabilities of treatment, use them to generate a pseudo balanced cohort. In
phase II outcome progression, we input the adjusted data to the subsequent
predictive network for making counterfactual predictions. We evaluate DeepRite
on both synthetic data and a real data collected from sepsis patients in the

synthetic data, and estimate unbiased treatment effects from real data that can
be better aligned with the standard guidelines for management of sepsis thanks
to its applicability to create balanced cohorts.

functional correctness of programs that use a combination of the aforementioned

a first-class protocol mechanism -- based on session types -- for reasoning
about message passing in the presence of other concurrency paradigms. We show
that Actris provides a suitable level of abstraction by proving functional
correctness of a variety of examples, including a channel-based merge sort, a
channel-based load-balancing mapper, and a variant of the map-reduce model,
using concise specifications. While Actris was already presented in a

significantly. Moreover, it extends Actris to Actris 2.0 with a notion of
subprotocols -- based on session-type subtyping -- that permits additional
flexibility when composing channel endpoints, and that takes full advantage of
the asynchronous semantics of message passing in Actris. Soundness of Actris
2.0 is proven using a model of its protocol mechanism in the Iris framework. We

Some
systems tackle Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) properties on automatic elasticity

specific platforms and convey that their ideas can be extrapolated to any FaaS

  An important question arises: do all FaaS platforms fit parallel
computations? In this paper, we argue that not all of them provide the
necessary means to host highly-parallel applications. To validate our
hypothesis, we create a comparative framework and categorize the architectures
of four cloud FaaS offerings, emphasizing parallel performance. We attest and
extend this description with an empirical experiment that consists in plotting
in deep detail the evolution of a parallel computing job on each service.
  The analysis of our results evinces that FaaS is not inherently good for
parallel computations and architectural differences across platforms are
decisive to categorize their performance. A key insight is the importance of
virtualization technologies and the scheduling approach of FaaS platforms.
Parallelism improves with lighter virtualization and proactive scheduling due
to finer resource allocation and faster elasticity. This causes some platforms
like AWS and IBM to perform well for highly-parallel computations, while others
such as Azure present difficulties to achieve the required parallelism degree.
Consequently, the information in this paper becomes of special interest to help
users choose the most adequate infrastructure for their parallel applications.

accretion rates much lower than the rate required for the spin-up/spin-down

substantial changes in the mass-flow rate. Our results indicate that the
magnitudes of the torques on either side of the torque reversal have a ratio

unsupervised learning, we obtain the limiting temperature of the nuclear
liquid-gas phase transition. Its value $9.24\pm0.04~\rm MeV$ is consistent with
that obtained by the traditional caloric curve method. Our study explores the
paradigm of combining the machine-learning techniques with heavy-ion
experimental data, and it is also instructive for studying the phase transition
of other uncontrollable systems, like QCD matter.

however the underlying mechanisms of early categorization are not well

limited duration of infant cooperation (10-15 minutes), which leaves little
room for multiple test trials. With its tight link to visual attention, eye
tracking is a promising method for getting access to the mechanisms of category
learning. But how should researchers decide which aspects of the rich eye
tracking data to focus on? To date, eye tracking variables are generally
handpicked, which may lead to biases in the eye tracking data. Here, we propose
an automated method for selecting eye tracking variables based on analyses of
their usefulness to discriminate learners from non-learners of visual
categories. We presented infants and adults with a category learning task and
tracked their eye movements. We then extracted an over-complete set of eye
tracking variables encompassing durations, probabilities, latencies, and the
order of fixations and saccadic eye movements. We compared three statistical
techniques for identifying those variables among this large set that are useful
for discriminating learners form non-learners: ANOVA ranking, Bayes ranking,
and L1 regularized logistic regression. We found remarkable agreement between
these methods in identifying a small set of discriminant variables. Moreover,
the same eye tracking variables allow us to classify category learners from
non-learners among adults and 6- to 8-month-old infants with accuracies above
71%.

spectral method to discriminate between the cosmic microwave background (CMB)

with examples based on the Q \& U Bolometric Interferometer for Cosmology

polarization of the sky at millimeter wavelengths. We consider the specific
cases of point source reconstruction and Galactic dust mapping and we
characterize the point spread function as a function of frequency. We study the

consider the effect of fallback accretion, and consider the evolution of the
system due to the different torques acting on the star, namely the spin up
torque due to accretion and spin-down torques due to magnetic dipole radiation,
neutrino emission, and gravitational wave emission linked to the formation of a
`mountain' on the accretion poles. Initially the spin period is mostly affected

We find that a magnetar formed after the collapse of a massive star can accrete
up to 1 M_{\odot} , and survive on the order of 50 s before collapsing to a
black hole. The gravitational wave strain, for an object located at 1 Mpc, is
h_c \sim 10^{-23} at kHz frequencies, making this a potential target for next
generation ground based detectors. A magnetar formed after a binary neutron
star merger, on the other hand, accretes at the most 0.2 M_{\odot}, and emits
gravitational waves with a lower maximum strain of the order of h_c \sim

social networks and fuzzy interpretations in fuzzy description logics have been
widely studied. For such structures, bisimulation is a natural notion for
characterizing indiscernibility between states or individuals. There are two
kinds of bisimulations for fuzzy structures: crisp bisimulations and fuzzy
bisimulations. While the latter fits to the fuzzy paradigm, the former has also
attracted attention due to the application of crisp equivalence relations, for
example, in minimizing structures. Bisimulations can be formulated for fuzzy
labeled graphs and then adapted to other fuzzy structures. In this article, we
present an efficient algorithm for computing the partition corresponding to the
largest crisp bisimulation of a given finite fuzzy labeled graph. Its
complexity is of order $O((m\log{l} + n)\log{n})$, where $n$, $m$ and $l$ are
the number of vertices, the number of nonzero edges and the number of different
fuzzy degrees of edges of the input graph, respectively. We also study a
similar problem for the setting with counting successors, which corresponds to
the case with qualified number restrictions in description logics and graded

understand and model the demand for these services. In this study, we developed
trip production and distribution models for ODT services at Dissemination areas
(DA) level using four machine learning algorithms: Random Forest (RF), Bagging,
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The data used in
the modelling process were acquired from Belleville's ODT operational data and
2016 census data. Bayesian optimalization approach was used to find the optimal
architecture of the adopted algorithms. Moreover, post-hoc model was employed
to interpret the predictions and examine the importance of the explanatory
variables. The results showed that the land-use type was the most important
variable in the trip production model. On the other hand, the demographic
characteristics of the trip destination were the most important variables in
the trip distribution model. Moreover, the results revealed that higher trip
distribution levels are expected between dissemination areas with
commercial/industrial land-use type and dissemination areas with high-density
residential land-use. Our findings suggest that the performance of ODT services
can be further enhanced by (a) locating idle vehicles in the neighbourhoods
with commercial/industrial land-use and (b) using the spatio-temporal demand

societal impact of COVID-19 in the United States during the early days of the
pandemic. With infections soaring rapidly, users took to Twitter asking people
to self isolate and quarantine themselves. Users also demanded closure of
schools, bars, and restaurants as well as lockdown of cities and states. We
methodically collect tweets by identifying and tracking trending COVID-related
hashtags. We first manually group the hashtags into six main categories,
namely, 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying, 4) School Closures,
5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope}, and study the temporal evolution of
tweets in these hashtags. We conduct a linguistic analysis of words common to
all hashtag groups and specific to each hashtag group and identify the chief
concerns of people as the pandemic gripped the nation (e.g., exploring bidets
as an alternative to toilet paper). We conduct sentiment analysis and our
investigation reveals that people reacted positively to school closures and
negatively to the lack of availability of essential goods due to panic buying.
We adopt a state-of-the-art semantic role labeling approach to identify the
action words and then leverage a LSTM-based dependency parsing model to analyze
the context of action words (e.g., verb deal is accompanied by nouns such as
anxiety, stress, and crisis). Finally, we develop a scalable seeded topic
modeling approach to automatically categorize and isolate tweets into hashtag
groups and experimentally validate that our topic model provides a grouping
similar to our manual grouping. Our study presents a systematic way to
construct an aggregated picture of peoples' response to the pandemic and lays
the groundwork for future fine-grained linguistic and behavioral analysis.

an immense potential in health care applications. However, domain adaptation
(DA) is needed to alleviate the problem of domain shifts that typically occurs
between video data captured in source and target do-mains. Given the laborious
task of collecting and annotating videos, and the subjective bias due to
ambiguity among adjacent intensity levels, weakly-supervised learning (WSL)is
gaining attention in such applications. Yet, most state-of-the-art WSL models
are typically formulated as regression problems, and do not leverage the
ordinal relation between intensity levels, nor the temporal coherence of
multiple consecutive frames. This paper introduces a new deep learn-ing model
for weakly-supervised DA with ordinal regression(WSDA-OR), where videos in
target domain have coarse la-bels provided on a periodic basis. The WSDA-OR
model enforces ordinal relationships among the intensity levels as-signed to
the target sequences, and associates multiple relevant frames to sequence-level
labels (instead of a single frame). In particular, it learns discriminant and
domain-invariant feature representations by integrating multiple in-stance
learning with deep adversarial DA, where soft Gaussian labels are used to
efficiently represent the weak ordinal sequence-level labels from the target
domain. The proposed approach was validated on the RECOLA video dataset as
fully-labeled source domain, and UNBC-McMaster video data as weakly-labeled
target domain. We have also validated WSDA-OR on BIOVID and Fatigue (private)
datasets for sequence level estimation. Experimental results indicate that our
approach can provide a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
models, allowing to achieve a greater localization accuracy.

explores the properties of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations when the
velocity field is expressed through a complete set of paired Clebsch
potentials. First, it is shown that the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
can be cast as a system of transport (convection-diffusion) equations where
each Clebsch potential plays the role of a generalized distribution function.
The diffusion operator associated with each Clebsch potential departs from the
standard Laplacian due to a term depending on the Lie-bracket of the
corresponding Clebsch pair. It is further shown that the Clebsch potentials can
be used to define a Shannon-type entropy measure, i.e. a functional, different
from energy and enstrophy, whose growth rate is non-negative. As a consequence,
the flow must vanish at equilibrium. This functional can be interpreted as a
measure of the topological complexity of the velocity field. In addition, the
Clebsch parametrization enables the identification of a class of flows, larger
than the class of two dimensional flows, possessing the property that the
vortex stretching term identically vanishes and the growth rate of entrophy is
non-positive.

heterogeneous. Even when tissue behavior is well understood, the exact subject
specific spatial distribution of material properties is often unknown. And,
when developing computational models of biological tissue, it is usually
prohibitively computationally expensive to simulate every plausible spatial
distribution of material properties for each problem of interest. Therefore,
one of the major challenges in developing accurate computational models of
biological tissue is capturing the potential effects of this spatial
heterogeneity. Recently, machine learning based metamodels have gained
popularity as a computationally tractable way to overcome this problem because
they can make predictions based on a limited number of direct simulation runs.
These metamodels are promising, but they often still require a high number of
direct simulations to achieve an acceptable performance. Here we show that
transfer learning, a strategy where knowledge gained while solving one problem
is transferred to solving a different but related problem, can help overcome
this limitation. Critically, transfer learning can be used to leverage both
low-fidelity simulation data and simulation data that is the outcome of solving
a different but related mechanical problem. In this paper, we extend Mechanical
MNIST, our open source benchmark dataset of heterogeneous material undergoing
large deformation, to include a selection of low-fidelity simulation results
that require 2-4 orders of magnitude less CPU time to run. Then, we show that
transferring the knowledge stored in metamodels trained on these low-fidelity
simulation results can vastly improve the performance of metamodels used to
predict the results of high-fidelity simulations.

explore the universe. Countries around the world have successively launched
various space exploration satellites. Accurate calibration on the ground is a
key factor for space science satellites to obtain observational results. In
order to provide calibration for various satellite-borne detectors, several
monochromatic X-rays facilities has been built at National Institute of
Metrology, P.R. China (NIM). These facilities are mainly based on grating
diffraction and Bragg diffraction, the energy range of produced monochromatic
X-rays is (0.218-301) keV. The facilities have a good performance on energy
stability, monochromaticity and flux stability. Monochromaticity of all
facilities is better than 3.0%, the stability of energy is better than 1.0%
over 8 hours, and the stability of flux is better than 2.0% over 8 hours. The
calibration experiments of satellite-borne detectors, such as energy linearity,
energy resolution, detection efficiency and temperature response can be carried
out on the facilities. So far we have completed the calibration of two
satellites, and there are still three satellites in progress. This work will
contribute to the development of X-ray astronomy, and contribute to the
development of Chinese space science.

takes advantage of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning methods for
extracting entities and relationships from research publications and integrates
them in a large-scale knowledge graph. Within this research work, we i) tackle
the challenge of knowledge extraction by employing several state-of-the-art
Natural Language Processing and Text Mining tools, ii) describe an approach for
integrating entities and relationships generated by these tools, iii) show the
advantage of such an hybrid system over alternative approaches, and vi) as a

statistical results for the contribution of magnetic reconnection (MR) events
at electron scales to the energy dissipation of coherent structures. The
Partial Variance of Increments (PVI) method is employed to find coherent
structures in the magnetic field data. The current sheet structures with
reversal of magnetic field components are further selected. We consider the
following criteria to identify the MR events, such as current sheet with
magnetic field reversal, significant energy dissipation, and evident electron
outflow velocity. Statistically, for most MR events, their PVI values are
larger than that of other types of coherent structures, and their energy
dissipations are also stronger than that of others. However, due to the
relatively small proportion of MR events, their contribution to coherent
structures' energy dissipation is relatively trivial. If taken into account the
dissipation of non-coherent structures, the MR's contribution to energy
dissipation would be less. Hence, we suggest that MR events, though have strong
dissipation locally, are not the major contributor to the energy dissipation in
the magnetosheath. After analyzing the features of non-MR current sheets, we
propose that non-MR current sheets are mainly coherent structures inherent to
kinetic Alfv\'en fluctuations.

In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework called SigNet, where
a signal-to-matrix (S2M) operator is adopted to convert the original signal
into a square matrix first and is co-trained with a follow-up CNN architecture
for classification. This model is further accelerated by integrating 1D
convolution operators, leading to the upgraded model SigNet2.0. The simulations
on two signal datasets show that both SigNet and SigNet2.0 outperform a number
of well-known baselines. More interestingly, our proposed models behave
extremely well in small-sample learning when only a small training dataset is
provided. They can achieve a relatively high accuracy even when 1\% training
data are kept, while other baseline models may lose their effectiveness much
more quickly as the datasets get smaller. Such result suggests that
SigNet/SigNet2.0 could be extremely useful in the situations where labeled
signal data are difficult to obtain. The visualization of the output features
of our models demonstrates that our model can well divide different modulation
types of signals in the feature hyper-space.

motion and appearance features from unlabeled video only, which can be reused
for downstream tasks such as action recognition. This task, however, is
extremely challenging due to 1) the highly complex spatial-temporal information
in videos; and 2) the lack of labeled data for training. Unlike the
representation learning for static images, it is difficult to construct a
suitable self-supervised task to well model both motion and appearance
features. More recently, several attempts have been made to learn video
representation through video playback speed prediction. However, it is
non-trivial to obtain precise speed labels for the videos. More critically, the
learnt models may tend to focus on motion pattern and thus may not learn
appearance features well. In this paper, we observe that the relative playback
speed is more consistent with motion pattern, and thus provide more effective
and stable supervision for representation learning. Therefore, we propose a new
way to perceive the playback speed and exploit the relative speed between two
video clips as labels. In this way, we are able to well perceive speed and
learn better motion features. Moreover, to ensure the learning of appearance
features, we further propose an appearance-focused task, where we enforce the
model to perceive the appearance difference between two video clips. We show
that optimizing the two tasks jointly consistently improves the performance on
two downstream tasks, namely action recognition and video retrieval.
Remarkably, for action recognition on UCF101 dataset, we achieve 93.7% accuracy
without the use of labeled data for pre-training, which outperforms the
ImageNet supervised pre-trained model. Code and pre-trained models can be found
