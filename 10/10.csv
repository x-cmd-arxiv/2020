  weak van der Waals interactions",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The application of new materials in nanotechnology opens new perspectives and
enables ground-breaking innovations. Two-dimensional van der Waals materials
and more specific, 2D chalcogenides are a promising class of new materials
awaiting their usage in the semiconductor industry. However, the integration of
van der Waals materials relying on industry-compatible manufacturing processes
is still a major challenge. This is currently restricting the application of
these new materials to the research laboratories environment only. The
large-area and single-crystalline growth of van der Waals materials is one of
the most important requirements to meet the challenging demands implied by the
semiconductor industry. This review contributes to a more generalized
understanding on the integration of van der Waals materials - and in more
specific 2D chalcogenides - through the growth process of epitaxy. This, can
pursue further the aspiration of large-area, single-crystalline and defect-free
epitaxial integration of (quasi) van der Waals homo- and heterostructures into
the great world of the semiconductor industry.

investigate hard and soft constraints into the model based on classical

currents, with a mixing determined by the spin-0 BEH fields. The charge $Q_U$
of chiral quarks and leptons is a combination of $Q,\ B,\ L_i$ and $T_{3L}$
with the axial $F_A$. It involves in general isovector and isoscalar axial
terms, in the presence of two BEH doublets. A longitudinal $U$ with axial
couplings has enhanced interactions, and behaves much as an axionlike particle.
Its axial couplings $g_A$, usually restricted to $< 2\times 10^{-7} m_U$(MeV),
lead to effective pseudoscalar ones $g_P= g_A\times 2m_{q,l}\,/m_U=2^{1/4}\,

parameter $r=\cos\theta_A$ induced by a singlet v.e.v., possibly large and

gauge coupling, expressed with two doublets and a singlet as $g""\!/4\simeq

implications for meson decays, neutrino interactions, atomic-physics parity

thermodynamically stable MAX compounds Hf2AB2 (A = In, Sn). The structural
properties are compared with the available data to assess the validity of
calculations. The mechanical stability of Hf2AB2 (A = In, Sn) compounds is
established with the help of the computed stiffness constants (Cij). The
possible reason for enhanced mechanical properties and Vickers hardness of
Hf2SnB2 is explained based on the analysis of bonding strength, followed by the
electronic density of states. Higher mechanical strength and Vickers hardness
of Hf2AB2 (A = In, Sn) compared to Hf2AC (A = In, Sn) are also indicated in the
light of charge density mapping. The values of Pugh ratio, Poissons ratio and
Cauchy pressure predict brittle character of the studied compounds. Besides,
the anisotropic nature of the titled borides is investigated by 2D and 3D plots
of elastic moduli along with some well established anisotropy indices. Thermal
properties were investigated by calculating the Debye temperature, minimum
thermal conductivity, Gr\""uneisen parameter, and melting temperature. The

variety of applications, such as chemometrics, signal processing, and machine
learning. A broadly used method for computing such decompositions relies on the
Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm. When the number of components is
small, regardless of its implementation, ALS exhibits low arithmetic intensity,
which severely hinders its performance and makes GPU offloading ineffective. We
observe that, in practice, experts often have to compute multiple
decompositions of the same tensor, each with a small number of components
(typically fewer than 20), to ultimately find the best ones to use for the
application at hand. In this paper, we illustrate how multiple decompositions
of the same tensor can be fused together at the algorithmic level to increase
the arithmetic intensity. Therefore, it becomes possible to make efficient use
of GPUs for further speedups; at the same time the technique is compatible with
many enhancements typically used in ALS, such as line search, extrapolation,
and non-negativity constraints. We introduce the Concurrent ALS algorithm and
library, which offers an interface to Matlab, and a mechanism to effectively
deal with the issue that decompositions complete at different times.
Experimental results on artificial and real datasets demonstrate a shorter time
to completion due to increased arithmetic intensity.

interpretability methods in the explainable Artificial Intelligence research
domain. They provide individuals with alternative scenarios and a set of
recommendations to achieve a sought-after machine learning model outcome.
Recently, the literature has identified desiderata of counterfactual
explanations, such as feasibility, actionability and sparsity that should
support their applicability in real-world contexts. However, we show that the
literature has neglected the problem of the time dependency of counterfactual
explanations. We argue that, due to their time dependency and because of the
provision of recommendations, even feasible, actionable and sparse
counterfactual explanations may not be appropriate in real-world applications.
This is due to the possible emergence of what we call ""unfortunate
counterfactual events."" These events may occur due to the retraining of machine
learning models whose outcomes have to be explained via counterfactual
explanation. Series of unfortunate counterfactual events frustrate the efforts
of those individuals who successfully implemented the recommendations of
counterfactual explanations. This negatively affects people's trust in the
ability of institutions to provide machine learning-supported decisions
consistently. We introduce an approach to address the problem of the emergence
of unfortunate counterfactual events that makes use of histories of
counterfactual explanations. In the final part of the paper we propose an
ethical analysis of two distinct strategies to cope with the challenge of
unfortunate counterfactual events. We show that they respond to an ethically
responsible imperative to preserve the trustworthiness of credit lending
organizations, the decision models they employ, and the social-economic
function of credit lending.

stabilize the heat equation with decay rate $\lambda$ and
$Ce^{C\sqrt{\lambda}}$ estimates, where Lebeau--Robbiano's spectral inequality
[30] is naturally used. Then a piecewise controlling argument leads to null
controllability with optimal cost $Ce^{C/T}$, as well as finite time
stabilization.

Much of this COVID-19 research depends on distributed computing. In this
article, I review distributed architectures -- various types of clusters, grids
and clouds -- that can be leveraged to perform these tasks at scale, at
high-throughput, with a high degree of parallelism, and which can also be used
to work collaboratively. High-performance computing (HPC) clusters will be used
to carry out much of this work. Several bigdata processing tasks used in
reducing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 require high-throughput approaches, and a
variety of tools, which Hadoop and Spark offer, even using commodity hardware.
Extremely large-scale COVID-19 research has also utilised some of the world's
fastest supercomputers, such as IBM's SUMMIT -- for ensemble docking
high-throughput screening against SARS-CoV-2 targets for drug-repurposing, and
high-throughput gene analysis -- and Sentinel, an XPE-Cray based system used to
explore natural products. Grid computing has facilitated the formation of the
world's first Exascale grid computer. This has accelerated COVID-19 research in
molecular dynamics simulations of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interactions through
massively-parallel computation and was performed with over 1 million volunteer
computing devices using the Folding@home platform. Grids and clouds both can
also be used for international collaboration by enabling access to important
datasets and providing services that allow researchers to focus on research
rather than on time-consuming data-management tasks.

$M$ different products. This paper considers the properties of the logistic
regression of the $N\times M$ array of i-buys-j purchase decisions,
$\left[Y_{ij}\right]_{1\leq i\leq N,1\leq j\leq M}$, onto known functions of
consumer and product attributes under asymptotic sequences where (i) both $N$
and $M$ grow large and (ii) the average number of products purchased per
consumer is finite in the limit. This latter assumption implies that the
network of purchases is sparse: only a (very) small fraction of all possible
purchases are actually made (concordant with many real-world settings). Under
sparse network asymptotics, the first and last terms in an extended
Hoeffding-type variance decomposition of the score of the logit composite
log-likelihood are of equal order. In contrast, under dense network
asymptotics, the last term is asymptotically negligible. Asymptotic normality
of the logistic regression coefficients is shown using a martingale central
limit theorem (CLT) for triangular arrays. Unlike in the dense case, the
normality result derived here also holds under degeneracy of the network
graphon. Relatedly, when there happens to be no dyadic dependence in the
dataset in hand, it specializes to recently derived results on the behavior of
logistic regression with rare events and iid data. Sparse network asymptotics
may lead to better inference in practice since they suggest variance estimators
which (i) incorporate additional sources of sampling variation and (ii) are
valid under varying degrees of dyadic dependence.

calculations, are solutions of an inhomogeneous equation with the source term
defined by the wave functions of the initial and final nuclear states and
interaction between the removed nucleon with the rest. The source term approach
(STA) allows the overlaps with correct asymptotic decrease to be modelled while
using nuclear many-body functions calculated in minimal model spaces. By
properly choosing the removed nucleon interaction the minimum-model-space STA
can reproduce reduced values of spectroscopic factors extracted from
nucleon-removal reactions and predicts isospin asymmetry in the spectroscopic
factor reduction. It is well-known that model space truncation leads to the
appearance of higher-order induced forces, with three-nucleon force being the
most important. In this paper the role of such a force on the source term
calculation is studied. Applications to one-nucleon removal from double-magic

develop a variety of state-of-the-art probabilistic models for forecasting
solar irradiance. We investigate the use of post-hoc calibration techniques for
ensuring well-calibrated probabilistic predictions. We train and evaluate the
models using public data from seven stations in the SURFRAD network, and
demonstrate that the best model, NGBoost, achieves higher performance at an
intra-hourly resolution than the best benchmark solar irradiance forecasting
model across all stations. Further, we show that NGBoost with CRUDE post-hoc
calibration achieves comparable performance to a numerical weather prediction
model on hourly-resolution forecasting.

Because the WD is old, and a member of a well-characterized hierarchical

directly connect the current semi-major axis to the pre-migration one, from

distinctive sign of on-shell particle production during inflation, presenting a
unique opportunity for the ""direct detection"" of particles with masses as large
as the inflationary Hubble scale ($H$). However, the strength of such
non-analyticity ordinarily drops exponentially by a Boltzmann-like factor as
masses exceed $H$. In this paper, we study an exception provided by a
dimension-5 derivative coupling of the inflaton to heavy-particle currents,
applying it specifically to the case of two real scalars. The operator has a
""chemical potential"" form, which harnesses the large kinetic energy scale of
the inflaton, $\dot{\phi}_{0}^{1/2} \approx 60H$, to act as an efficient source
of scalar particle production. Derivative couplings of inflaton ensure
radiative stability of the slow-roll potential, which in turn maintains
(approximate) scale-invariance of the inflationary correlations. We show that a
signal not suffering Boltzmann suppression can be obtained in the bispectrum
with strength $f_{\mathrm{NL}} \sim \mathcal{O}(0.01-10)$ for an extended range
of scalar masses, $M \lesssim \dot{\phi}_{0}^{1/2}$, potentially as high as
$10^{15}$ GeV, within the sensitivity of upcoming LSS and more futuristic 21-cm
experiments. The mechanism does not invoke any particular fine-tuning of
parameters or breakdown of perturbation-theoretic control. The leading
contribution appears at tree-level, which makes the calculation analytically
tractable and removes the loop-suppression as compared to earlier chemical
potential studies of non-zero spins. The steady particle production allows us
to infer the effective mass of the heavy particles and the chemical potential
from the variation in bispectrum oscillations as a function of co-moving
momenta. Our analysis sets the stage for generalization to heavy bosons with
non-zero spin.

the contrary, we do not detect any difference in their [alpha/Fe]: this depends
primarily on stellar mass and not on group hierarchy nor host halo mass. We
also find that the differences in the median age and metallicity of satellites

We argue that the observed trends at low masses reveal the action of

When accounting for the varying quiescent fraction, small residual excess in
age, metallicity and [alpha/Fe] emerge for satellites dominated by old stellar
populations and residing in halos more massive than 10^{14}Msun, compared to

long-sought-after fault-tolerant quantum computation. A large topological gap
between the MZMs and the lowest excitations enabled detailed characterization
of vortex MZMs in those materials. Despite those achievements, a practical
implementation of topological quantum computation based on MZM braiding remains
elusive in this new Majorana platform. Among the most pressing issues are the
lack of controllable tuning methods for vortex MZMs and inhomogeneity of the
FeSC Majorana compounds that destroys MZMs during the braiding process. Thus,
the realization of tunable vortex MZMs in a truly homogeneous compound of
stoichiometric composition and with a charge neutral cleavage surface is highly
desirable. Here we demonstrate experimentally that the stoichiometric
superconductor LiFeAs is a good candidate to overcome these two obstacles.
Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we discover that the MZMs, which are
absent on the natural surface, can appear in vortices influenced by native
impurities. Our detailed analysis and model calculations clarify the mechanism
of emergence of MZMs in this material, paving a way towards MZMs tunable by
controllable methods such as electrostatic gating. The tunability of MZMs in
this homogeneous material offers an unprecedented platform to manipulate and
braid MZMs, the essential ingredients for topological quantum computation.

fields for many years. In particular, methanol can be used to probe different
parts of protostars such as accretion discs and outflows, since it produces one
of the strongest and the most commonly observed masers in massive star-forming
regions. We investigate the polarization properties of selected methanol maser
transitions in light of newly calculated methanol Land\'e g-factors and
considering hyperfine components. We compare our results with previous
observations and we evaluate the effect of preferred hyperfine pumping and
non-Zeeman effects. We run simulations using the radiative transfer code CHAMP.
We find a dependence of linear and circular polarization fractions on the
hyperfine transitions. Preferred hyperfine pumping can explain some high levels
of linear and circular polarization and some of the peculiar features seen in
the S-shape of observed V-profiles. Methanol masers are not significantly
affected by non-Zeeman effects. Our models show that for methanol maser
emission, both the linear and circular polarization percentages depend on which
hyperfine transition is masing and the degree to which it is being pumped.
Since non-Zeeman effects become more relevant at high values of brightness
temperatures, it is important to obtain good estimates of these quantities and
on maser beaming angles. Better constraints on the brightness temperature will
help in understand about the extent to which non-Zeeman effects contribute to
the observed polarization percentages. In order to detect separate hyperfine
components, an intrinsic thermal line width significantly smaller than the
hyperfine separation is required.

encounters a big crunch singularity when initial conditions are given in the
Planck regime. We show that this problem of onset of inflation in low energy
scale inflationary models can be successfully overcome in a quantum
gravitational framework where the big bang/big crunch singularities are
resolved and a non-singular cyclic evolution exists prior to inflation. As an
example we consider a model in loop quantum cosmology and demonstrate that the
successful onset of low energy scale inflation in a closed universe is possible
for the Starobinsky inflationary model starting from a variety of initial
conditions where it is impossible in the classical theory. For comparison we
also investigate the onset of inflation in the $\phi^2$ inflationary model
under similar unfavorable conditions. The pre-inflationary phase with quantum
gravity effects is shown to be composed of non-identical cycles of bounces and
recollapses resulting in a hysteresis-like phenomenon, which plays an important
role in creating suitable conditions for inflation to occur after some number
of non-singular cycles. Our analysis shows that the tension in the classical

to have a standardized unified way to describe all of them and take them into

although at a first glance quite dissimilar, are possible to unify them within

fluid approach that allows to map any modified gravity model as an effective
dark energy fluid and then we show how to implement it into existing Boltzmann
codes in a simple and straightforward way. This approach has also the advantage
that only a handful of variables are needed to compute, i.e the equation of

anisotropic stress $\pi(a,k)$ at the linear perturbation. In particular we show
that with simple modifications to the latter Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving

in recent years. This study uses public and open data to examine tract-level

frameworks for a quality of street networks defined here as griddedness. It
measures how griddedness, orientation order, straightness, 4-way intersections,
and intersection density declined from 1940 through the 1990s while dead-ends

shifting back toward historical design patterns. Yet, despite this rebound,
when controlling for topography and built environment factors all decades
post-1939 are associated with lower griddedness than pre-1940. Higher

well-established relationship with vehicle kilometers traveled and greenhouse
gas emissions - while controlling for density, home and household size, income,

First, we formulate a detailed thermal model for a crossbar in a neuromorphic
hardware incorporating workload dependency, where the temperature of each
NVM-based synaptic cell is computed considering the thermal contributions from
its neighboring cells. Second, we incorporate this thermal model in the mapping
of neurons and synapses of SNN-based workloads using a hill-climbing heuristic.
The objective is to reduce the thermal gradient in crossbars. We evaluate our
neuron and synapse mapping technique using 10 machine learning workloads for a
state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware. We demonstrate an average 11.4K
reduction in the average temperature of each crossbar in the hardware, leading
to a 52% reduction in the leakage power consumption (11% lower total energy
consumption) compared to a performance-oriented SNN mapping technique.

from data, allowing various distance measures to be applied on the calculated

way to handle out-of-vocabulary (OOV) IPs not seen during training. In this
paper, we propose a novel approach for IP embedding using an adapted graph
neural network (GNN) architecture. This approach has the advantages of working
on the raw data, scalability and, most importantly, induction, i.e. the ability
to measure similarity between previously unseen IPs. Using data from an

increased attention from the research community. When multiple objective
functions are present among agents, many works optimize the sum of these
objective functions. However, this formulation implies a decision regarding the
relative importance of each objective function. In fact, optimizing the sum is
a special case of a multi-objective problem in which all objectives are
prioritized equally. In this paper, a distributed optimization algorithm that
explores Pareto optimal solutions for non-homogeneously weighted sums of
objective functions is proposed. This exploration is performed through a new
rule based on agents' priorities that generates edge weights in agents'
communication graph. These weights determine how agents update their decision
variables with information received from other agents in the network. Agents
initially disagree on the priorities of the objective functions though they are
driven to agree upon them as they optimize. As a result, agents still reach a
common solution. The network-level weight matrix is (non-doubly) stochastic,
which contrasts with many works on the subject in which it is
doubly-stochastic. New theoretical analyses are therefore developed to ensure
convergence of the proposed algorithm. This paper provides a gradient-based
optimization algorithm, proof of convergence to solutions, and convergence
rates of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that agents' initial priorities
influence the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm and that these initial
choices affect its long-run behavior. Numerical results performed with
different numbers of agents illustrate the performance and efficiency of the
proposed algorithm.

this result and further reveal that the incorporation of Cu occurs
preferentially on one of the z = 1/4 or z = 3/4 planes before filling the other
plane. Furthermore, the amount of $\mathrm{Cu_{Hg}}$ anti-site defects
quantified by REXD was found to be directly proportional to the experimentally

evolution of public opinion. Intensive research has been carried out on these
models, especially exploring the different rules and topologies, which can be
considered two degrees of freedom of these models. In this paper we introduce
what can be considered a third degree of freedom.
  Since it is not possible to directly access someone's opinions without
measuring them, we always need to choose a way to transform real world opinions
(e.g. being anti-Trump) into numbers. However, the properties of this
transformation are usually not discussed in opinion dynamics literature. For
example, it would be fundamental to know if this transformation of opinions
into numbers should be unique, or if several are possible; and in the latter
case, how the choice of the scale would affect the model dynamics.
  In this article we explore this question by using the knowledge developed in
psychometrics. This field has been studying how to transform psychological
constructs (such as opinions) into numbers for more than 100 years.
  We start by introducing this phenomenon by looking at a simple example in
opinion dynamics. Then we provide the necessary mathematical background and
analyze three opinion dynamics models introduced by Hegselmann and Krause.
Finally, we test the models using agent-based simulations both in the case of
perfect scales (infinite precision) and in the case of real world scales.
  Both in the theoretical analysis and in the simulations, we show how the
choice of the scale (even in the case of perfect accuracy and precision) can
strongly change the model's dynamics. Indeed, by choosing a different scale it
is possible to (1) find different numbers of final opinion clusters, (2) change
the mean value of the final opinion distribution up to a change of $\pm 100 \%$
and (3) even transform one model into another.

transmission from one cluster to another. We refer to these as barrier weights

Unlike other work on graph partitioning and clustering, we completely

puzzle in cosmology. Two mechanisms for baryon asymmetry have been proposed as
extensions of the Standard Model of Particle Physics at high energies. They
rely on new couplings involving the baryon number current, one with a scalar
field, called Spontaneous Baryogenesis, and the other with space-time
curvature, named Gravitational Baryogenesis. These two mechanisms are
investigated in the context of many bouncing scenarios, either symmetric or
asymmetric around the bounce. It is shown that the constraints on the free
parameters of these scenarios, imposed to yield the observed baryon-to-entropy
ratio, are mild, already containing the values compatible with other
observational constraints coming from the features of the power spectra of
cosmological perturbations. Hence, realistic bouncing models can yield the
observed baryon-antibaryon asymmetry if one of the two mechanisms proposed

  Median luminosity, as we know, divides any given population into equal
halves. When the functional form of a distribution is unknown, it can be a more
robust diagnostic than any that use trial functional forms. In this work we
employ a statistical test based on median luminosity and apply it to test a
class of models for GRBs. We assume that the GRB jet has a finite opening angle
and that the orientation of the GRB jet is random relative to the observer. We
parameterize the jet with constant Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ and opening angle
$\theta_0$.
  We calculate $L_{median}$ as a function of redshift with an average of 17
grbs in each redshift bin($dz=0.01$) empirically, theoretically and use Fermi
GBM data, noting that SWIFT data is problematic as it is biased, specially at
high redshifts. We find that $L_{median}$ is close to $L_{max}$ for
sufficiently extended GRB jet and does not fit the data. We find an acceptable
fit with the data when $\Gamma$ is between $100$ and $200$, $\theta_0\leq 0.1$,
provided that the jet material along the line of sight to the on axis observer
is optically thick, such that the shielded maximum luminosity is well below the
bare $L_{max}$. If we associate an on-axis observer with a classically
projected monotonically decreasing afterglow, we find that their ILF is similar
to those of off-jet observer which we associate with flat phase afterglows.

from one neural network (teacher) to another (student), thus improving the
performance of the student. To make the student better mimic the behavior of
the teacher, the existing work focuses on designing different criteria to align
their logits or representations. Different from these efforts, we address
knowledge distillation from a novel data perspective. We argue that
transferring knowledge at sparse training data points cannot enable the student
to well capture the local shape of the teacher function. To address this issue,
we propose locally linear region knowledge distillation ($\rm L^2$RKD) which
transfers the knowledge in local, linear regions from a teacher to a student.
This is achieved by enforcing the student to mimic the outputs of the teacher
function in local, linear regions. To the end, the student is able to better
capture the local shape of the teacher function and thus achieves a better
performance. Despite its simplicity, extensive experiments demonstrate that
$\rm L^2$RKD is superior to the original KD in many aspects as it outperforms
KD and the other state-of-the-art approaches by a large margin, shows
robustness and superiority under few-shot settings, and is more compatible with

2023 to carry out a principal component analysis (PCA) as a means to study
previously reported variations in the PAH emission. We find that almost all of
the variations (99%) can be explained with just two parameters -- the first two
principal components (PCs). We explore the characteristics of these PCs and
show that the first PC ($PC_{1}$), which is the primary driver of the
variation, represents the amount of emission of a mixture of PAHs with ionized
species dominating over neutral species. The second PC ($PC_{2}$) traces
variations in the ionization state of the PAHs across the nebula. Correlations
of the PCs with various PAH ratios show that the 6.2 and 7.7 $\mu$m bands
behave differently than the 8.6 and 11.0 $\mu$m bands, thereby forming two
distinct groups of ionized bands. We compare the spatial distribution of the
PCs to the physical conditions, in particular to the strength of the radiation
field, $G_{0}$, and the $G_{0}/n_{H}$ ratio and find that the variations in
$PC_{2}$, i.e. the ionization state of PAHs are strongly affected by $G_{0}$
whereas the amount of PAH emission (as traced by $PC_{1}$) does not depend on
$G_0$.

at high temperatures when lattices are the most distorted -- while introducing
a systematic route for generalization to new crystal structures. Moreover,
through the use of outlier detection algorithms our approach is capable of
discerning between amorphous atomic motifs (i.e., noncrystalline phases) and
unknown crystal structures, making it uniquely suited for exploratory materials

their nest and the food by successive random explorations, without any mean of
communication other than the pheromones they leave behind them. This striking
phenomenon has been observed experimentally and modelled by different
mean-field reinforcement-learning models in the biology literature.
  In this paper, we introduce the first probabilistic reinforcement-learning
model for this phenomenon. In this model, the ants explore a finite graph in
which two nodes are distinguished as the nest and the source of food. The ants
perform successive random walks on this graph, starting from the nest and
stopped when first reaching the food, and the transition probabilities of each
random walk depend on the realizations of all previous walks through some
dynamic weighting of the graph. We discuss different variants of this model
based on different reinforcement rules and show that slight changes in this
reinforcement rule can lead to drastically different outcomes.
  We prove that, in two variants of this model and when the underlying graph
is, respectively, any series-parallel graph and a 5-edge non-series-parallel
losange graph, the ants indeed eventually find the shortest path(s) between
their nest and the food. Both proofs rely on the electrical network method for
random walks on weighted graphs and on Rubin's embedding in continuous time.
The proof in the series-parallel cases uses the recursive nature of this family
of graphs, while the proof in the seemingly-simpler losange case turns out to
be quite intricate: it relies on a fine analysis of some stochastic
approximation, and on various couplings with standard and generalised P\'olya

  Variations",,,,,"cs.SE cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are being deployed in a wide range of settings
today, from safety-critical applications like autonomous driving to commercial
applications involving image classifications. However, recent research has
shown that DNNs can be brittle to even slight variations of the input data.
Therefore, rigorous testing of DNNs has gained widespread attention.
  While DNN robustness under norm-bound perturbation got significant attention
over the past few years, our knowledge is still limited when natural variants
of the input images come. These natural variants, e.g. a rotated or a rainy
version of the original input, are especially concerning as they can occur
naturally in the field without any active adversary and may lead to undesirable
consequences. Thus, it is important to identify the inputs whose small
variations may lead to erroneous DNN behaviors. The very few studies that
looked at DNN's robustness under natural variants, however, focus on estimating
the overall robustness of DNNs across all the test data rather than localizing
such error-producing points. This work aims to bridge this gap.
  To this end, we study the local per-input robustness properties of the DNNs
and leverage those properties to build a white-box (DeepRobust-W) and a
black-box (DeepRobust-B) tool to automatically identify the non-robust points.
Our evaluation of these methods on three DNN models spanning three widely used
image classification datasets shows that they are effective in flagging points
of poor robustness. In particular, DeepRobust-W and DeepRobust-B are able to
achieve an F1 score of up to 91.4% and 99.1%, respectively. We further show
that DeepRobust-W can be applied to a regression problem in another domain. Our
evaluation on three self-driving car models demonstrates that DeepRobust-W is
effective in identifying points of poor robustness with F1 score up to 78.9%.

observable traits (phenotypes) from a new genetic constitution (genotype) of an
organism under environmental perturbations (e.g., drug treatment). The
emergence of multiple omics data provides new opportunities but imposes great
challenges in the predictive modeling of genotype-phenotype associations.
Firstly, the high-dimensionality of genomics data and the lack of labeled data
often make the existing supervised learning techniques less successful.
Secondly, it is a challenging task to integrate heterogeneous omics data from
different resources. Finally, the information transmission from DNA to
phenotype involves multiple intermediate levels of RNA, protein, metabolite,
etc. The higher-level features (e.g., gene expression) usually have stronger
discriminative power than the lower level features (e.g., somatic mutation). To
address above issues, we proposed a novel Cross-LEvel Information Transmission
network (CLEIT) framework. CLEIT aims to explicitly model the asymmetrical
multi-level organization of the biological system. Inspired by domain
adaptation, CLEIT first learns the latent representation of high-level domain
then uses it as ground-truth embedding to improve the representation learning
of the low-level domain in the form of contrastive loss. In addition, we adopt
a pre-training-fine-tuning approach to leveraging the unlabeled heterogeneous
omics data to improve the generalizability of CLEIT. We demonstrate the
effectiveness and performance boost of CLEIT in predicting anti-cancer drug
sensitivity from somatic mutations via the assistance of gene expressions when

($t$) and crossing times ($t_{cr}$). We have also incorporated results for 27
previously studied clusters, creating a sample of 65, spanning the age and
Galactocentric distance ($R_G$) ranges: 7.0 < log ($t$) < 9.7 and 6 < $R_G$

and astrometric data from the Gaia DR2 catalogue. Member stars are identified
by employing a decontamination algorithm which operates on the 3D astrometric
space of parallax and proper motion and attributes membership likelihoods for
stars in the cluster region. Our results show that the internal relaxation
causes $r_c$ to correlate negatively with the dynamical ratio $\tau_{dyn}$ =
$t/t_{cr}$. This implies that dynamically older systems tend to be more
centrally concentrated. The more concentrated ones tend to present smaller
$r_{hm}/r_t$ ratios, which means that they are less subject to tidal
disruption. The analysis of coeval groups at compatible $R_G$ suggests that the
inner structure of clusters is reasonably insensitive to variations in the
external tidal field. Additionally, our results confirm, on average, an
increase in $r_t$ for regions with less intense Galactic gravitational field.

ability to represent transitive asymmetric relations via containment. Box
embeddings, where objects are represented by n-dimensional hyperrectangles, are
a particularly promising example of such an embedding as they are closed under
intersection and their volume can be calculated easily, allowing them to
naturally represent calibrated probability distributions. The benefits of
geometric embeddings also introduce a problem of local identifiability,
however, where whole neighborhoods of parameters result in equivalent loss
which impedes learning. Prior work addressed some of these issues by using an
approximation to Gaussian convolution over the box parameters, however, this
intersection operation also increases the sparsity of the gradient. In this
work, we model the box parameters with min and max Gumbel distributions, which
were chosen such that space is still closed under the operation of the
intersection. The calculation of the expected intersection volume involves all
parameters, and we demonstrate experimentally that this drastically improves
the ability of such models to learn.

cluster mass as $\sim M^{-2.0^{+0.8}_{-0.9}}$. This result rules out zero mass
dependence of the cluster X-ray AGN space density at the 2.5$\sigma$ level. We
compare our cluster X-ray AGN sample to a control field with identical

For fainter galaxies, this difference is not present. Comparing the X-ray

recollides with its parent ion within the same light cycle and, during that

high energy and back. Therefore, recollision offers unprecedented time
resolution and it is the foundation on which attosecond science is built. For
simple systems, recolliding trajectories are shaped by the strong field acting
together with the Coulomb potential and they can be readily calculated and
measured. However, for more complex systems, multielectron effects are also
important because they dynamically alter the recolliding wave packet
trajectories. Here, we theoretically study Fano resonances, one of the most
accessible multielectron effects, and we show how multielectron dynamics can be
unambiguously isolated when we use in situ measurement. The general class of in

from multiple sensors: sparse LiDAR data, a mono camera and low-cost ultrasonic

camera sensor used to detect candidate curb features and it effectively removes
false positives arising from surrounding static and moving obstacles. The
detection accuracy of the tracking algorithm is boosted by using Kalman
filter-based prediction and fusion with lateral distance information from
low-cost ultrasonic sensors. We next propose a line-fitting algorithm that
yields robust results for curb locations. Finally, we demonstrate the practical

required size of the active space, size-consistency, symmetry breaking in the

observe that possible errors caused by symmetry breaking can be mitigated by
employing the determinant with the largest weight in the active space as
reference for the TCC calculation. We find the TCC model to be promising in
calculations with active orbital spaces which include all orbitals with a large
single-orbital entropy, even if the active spaces become very large and then
may require modern active-space approaches that are not restricted to
comparatively small numbers of orbitals. Furthermore, utilizing large active

representations of entities, like words, that are central to many machine

retrofitting, a class of methods that incorporate task-specific domain
knowledge encoded as a graph over a subset of these entities. However, existing
retrofitting algorithms face two limitations: they overfit the observed graph
by failing to represent relationships with missing entities; and they underfit
the observed graph by only learning embeddings in Euclidean manifolds, which
cannot faithfully represent even simple tree-structured or cyclic graphs. We
address these problems with two key contributions: (i) we propose a novel
regularizer, a conformality regularizer, that preserves local geometry from the
pretrained embeddings---enabling generalization to missing entities and (ii) a
new Riemannian feedforward layer that learns to map pre-trained embeddings onto
a non-Euclidean manifold that can better represent the entire graph. Through
experiments on WordNet, we demonstrate that the conformality regularizer
prevents even existing (Euclidean-only) methods from overfitting on link
prediction for missing entities, and---together with the Riemannian feedforward
layer---learns non-Euclidean embeddings that outperform them.

the LVC estimate of $0.28^{+0.13}_{-0.07}$ (both reported as median values
withs 90\% credible intervals). We also constrain the binary to be more
face-on, and find a broader posterior for the spin precession parameter. We
further find that even though $\ell=4$ harmonic modes have negligible
signal-to-noise ratio, omission of these modes will influence the estimated
posterior distribution of several source parameters including chirp mass,
effective inspiral spin, luminosity distance, and inclination. We also find
that commonly used model approximations, such as neglecting the asymmetric

many applications. Gradient averaging based DPFL methods require costly
communication rounds and hardly work with large-capacity models, due to the
explicit dimension dependence in its added noise. In this work, inspired by
knowledge transfer non-federated privacy learning from Papernot et al.(2017;
2018), we design two new DPFL schemes, by voting among the data labels returned
from each local model, instead of averaging the gradients, which avoids the
dimension dependence and significantly reduces the communication cost.
Theoretically, by applying secure multi-party computation, we could
exponentially amplify the (data-dependent) privacy guarantees when the margin
of the voting scores are large. Extensive experiments show that our approaches
significantly improve the privacy-utility trade-off over the state-of-the-arts

  applications from gasdynamics to relativistic magnetohydrodynamics",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we consider the general family of the so called ADER PNPM
schemes for the numerical solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations
with \textit{arbitrary} high order of accuracy in space and time.
  The family of one-step PNPM schemes was introduced in [Dumbser et al., JCP,
2008] and represents a unified framework for classical high order Finite Volume
(FV) schemes (N=0), the usual Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods (N=M), as
well as a new class of intermediate hybrid schemes for which a reconstruction
operator of degree M is applied over piecewise polynomial data of degree N with
M>N. In all cases with M >= N > 0 the PNPM schemes are linear in the sense of
Godunov, thus when considering phenomena characterized by discontinuities,
spurious oscillations may appear and even destroy the simulation. Therefore, in
this paper we present a new simple, robust and accurate a posteriori subcell
finite volume limiting strategy that is valid for the entire class of PNPM
schemes. The subcell FV limiter is activated only where it is needed, i.e. in
the neighborhood of shocks or other discontinuities, and is able to maintain
the resolution of the underlying high order PNPM schemes, due to the use of a
rather fine subgrid of 2N+1 subcells per space dimension.
  The paper contains a wide set of test cases for different hyperbolic PDE
systems, solved on adaptive Cartesian meshes (AMR) that show the capabilities
of the proposed method both on smooth and discontinuous problems, as well as
the broad range of its applicability. The tests range from compressible
gasdynamics over classical MHD to relativistic magnetohydrodynamics.

molecules in cells, we present a modular framework to treat first-passage
problems for diffusion in partitioned spaces. The spatial domains can differ
with respect to their diffusivity, geometry, and dimensionality, but can also
refer to transport modes alternating between diffusive, driven, or anomalous
motion. The approach relies on a coarse-graining of the motion by dissecting
the trajectories on domain boundaries or when the mode of transport changes,
yielding a small set of states. The time evolution of the reduced model follows
a generalized master equation (GME) for non-Markovian jump processes; the GME
takes the form of a set of linear integro-differential equations in the
occupation probabilities of the states and the corresponding probability
fluxes. Further building blocks of the model are partial first-passage time
(FPT) densities, which encode the transport behavior in each domain or state.
After an outline of the general framework for multiple domains, the approach is
exemplified and validated for a target search problem with two domains in one-
and three-dimensional space, first by exactly reproducing known results for an
artificially divided, homogeneous space, and second by considering the
situation of domains with distinct diffusivities. Analytical solutions for the
FPT densities are given in Laplace domain and are complemented by numerical
backtransforms yielding FPT densities over many decades in time, confirming
that the geometry and heterogeneity of the space can introduce additional
characteristic time scales.

initial states, we simulate the time evolutions of the internal energy, power
and heat-work conversion efficiency. The initial state impacts on these
thermodynamic quantities before the Otto cycle reaches stable. In the
transition period, the efficiency and power may be higher or lower than the
corresponding values in the cyclostationary state. Remarkably, the efficiency
could surpass the Otto limit and even the Carnot limit and the power could be
much higher than the rated power. The efficiency anomaly is due to the energy
in the initial state. Thus, we suggest that periodically pumping could take the
similar role of a hot bath but could be manipulated flexibly. Furthermore, we
propose a new quantum engine working in a single reservoir to convert the pump

applied to working in the microenvironments without a large temperature

neutrino emissivities of all the relevant weak interaction processes without
making any assumption about the neutrino degeneracy. We analyse systematically
the role the initial conditions of unburnt hadronic matter, such as density,
temperature, neutrino trapping and composition, focusing on typical
astrophysical scenarios such as cold neutron stars, protoneutron stars, and
post merger compact objects. We find that the temperature within the flame
rises significantly in a timescale of 1 nanosecond. The increase in $T$
strongly depends on the initial strangeness of hadronic matter and tends to be
more drastic at larger densities. Typical final values range between $20$ and
$60 \, \mathrm{MeV}$. The nonleptonic process $u + d \rightarrow u + s$ is
always dominant in cold stars, but in hot objects the process $u + e^{-}

function only requires eight more scalar parameters each relation, but improves
expressive power and alleviates embedding ambiguity problem. Based on the

appears in strongly magnetized clouds with $B_0 \gtrsim B_{\rm 0, cr}$
$=10^{-4} (M_{\rm cl}/100 {\rm M}_\odot){\rm G}$, where $M_{\rm cl}$ is the
cloud mass. When a cloud has a weaker magnetic field, the outflow does not
evolve promptly with a high mass accretion rate. In some cases with moderate
magnetic fields $B_0$ slightly smaller than $B_{\rm 0,cr}$, the outflow growth
is suppressed or delayed until the infalling envelope dissipates and the ram
pressure around the protostellar system is significantly reduced. In such an
environment, the outflow begins to grow and reaches a large distance only
during the late accretion phase. On the other hand, the protostellar outflow
fails to evolve and is finally collapsed by the strong ram pressure when a
massive $(\gtrsim 100 {\rm M}_\odot)$ initial cloud is weakly magnetized with
$B_0 \lesssim 100 \mu {\rm G}$. The failed outflow creates a toroidal structure
that is supported by magnetic pressure and encloses the protostar and disk
system. Our results indicate that high-mass stars form only in strongly
magnetized clouds, if all high-mass protostars possess a clear outflow. If we
would observe either very weak or no outflow around evolved protostars, it
means that strong magnetic fields are not necessarily required for high-mass
star formation. In any case, we can constrain the high-mass star formation
process from observations of outflows.

respect to uncertainties in the system's states transition probabilities. The
need for RCMPDs is important for real-life applications of RL. For instance,
such formulation can play an important role for policy transfer from simulation
to real world (Sim2Real) in safety critical applications, which would benefit
from performance and safety guarantees which are robust w.r.t model
uncertainty. We first propose the general problem formulation under the concept
of RCMDP, and then propose a Lagrangian formulation of the optimal problem,
leading to a robust-constrained policy gradient RL algorithm. We finally
validate this concept on the inventory management problem.

from full-precision neurons to the target binary ones. Each individual weight
entry will not be binarized independently. Instead, they are taken as a whole
to accomplish the binarization, just as they work together in generating
convolution features. To help the training of the binarization mapping, the
full-precision neurons after taking sign operations is regarded as some

An unbiased estimator is therefore introduced to mitigate the influence of the

an agent must learn to both understand and generate words in an existing
language, but with the assumption that access to interaction with ""oracle""
speakers of the language is very limited. We show that using self-play as a
substitute for direct supervision enables the agent to transfer its knowledge

better inferences about the ground truth lexicon using only a handful of

set shared by source and target domains, as there is simply no labeling
available in the target domain. In this paper, we employ a probabilistic
approach for locating the common label set, where each source class may come
from the common label set with a probability. In particular, we propose a novel
approach for evaluating the probability of each source class from the common
label set, where this probability is computed by the prediction margin
accumulated over the whole target domain. Then, we propose a simple universal

common label set and explore the properties on the target risk for UDA.
Extensive experiments indicate that S-UAN works well in different UDA settings

address each of these shortcomings by developing a point process model that

represents sequence occurrences as a small number of marked events in
continuous time. This ultra-sparse representation of sequence events opens new
possibilities for spike train modeling. For example, we introduce learnable

prunings, prune the network model along one dimension (depth, width, or
resolution) solely to meet a computational budget. However, such a pruning
policy often leads to excessive reduction of that dimension, thus inducing a
huge accuracy loss. To alleviate this issue, we argue that pruning should be
conducted along three dimensions comprehensively. For this purpose, our pruning
framework formulates pruning as an optimization problem. Specifically, it first
casts the relationships between a certain model's accuracy and
depth/width/resolution into a polynomial regression and then maximizes the
polynomial to acquire the optimal values for the three dimensions. Finally, the
model is pruned along the three optimal dimensions accordingly. In this
framework, since collecting too much data for training the regression is very
time-costly, we propose two approaches to lower the cost: 1) specializing the
polynomial to ensure an accurate regression even with less training data; 2)
employing iterative pruning and fine-tuning to collect the data faster.
Extensive experiments show that our proposed algorithm surpasses
state-of-the-art pruning algorithms and even neural architecture search-based

Furthermore, there is no study to inquire about the effectiveness and
efficiency of such data management in a SWfMS from a user perspective. In this
paper, we present and evaluate a GUI version of such a novel approach of
intermediate data management with two use cases (Plant Phenotyping and

workflows with processed data (i.e., intermediate outcomes of modules in a

SWfMS. We integrated GUI-RISPTS with an existing workflow management system

selecting the recommendation of intermediate states (i.e., modules' outcomes).

sample efficient than model-free RL, but in practice, it is not always true due
to overweighed model errors. In complex and noisy settings, model-based RL
tends to have trouble using the model if it does not know when to trust the
model.
  In this work, we find that better model usage can make a huge difference. We
show theoretically that if the use of model-generated data is restricted to
state-action pairs where the model error is small, the performance gap between
model and real rollouts can be reduced. It motivates us to use model rollouts
only when the model is confident about its predictions. We propose Masked
Model-based Actor-Critic (M2AC), a novel policy optimization algorithm that
maximizes a model-based lower-bound of the true value function. M2AC implements
a masking mechanism based on the model's uncertainty to decide whether its
prediction should be used or not. Consequently, the new algorithm tends to give
robust policy improvements. Experiments on continuous control benchmarks
demonstrate that M2AC has strong performance even when using long model
rollouts in very noisy environments, and it significantly outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods.

adversary has full knowledge about the gradient computation assignments of the

of bipartite expander graphs for the assignment of tasks to workers; this helps
to effectively mitigate the effect of the Byzantine behavior. Specifically, we
demonstrate an upper bound on the worst case fraction of corrupted gradients
based on the eigenvalues of our constructions which are based on mutually
orthogonal Latin squares and Ramanujan graphs. Our numerical experiments
indicate over a 36% reduction on average in the fraction of corrupted gradients
compared to the state of the art. Likewise, our experiments on training

This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically learn a multi-path
network for multi-domain visual classification on mobile devices. The proposed
multi-path network is learned from neural architecture search by applying one
reinforcement learning controller for each domain to select the best path in
the super-network created from a MobileNetV3-like search space. An adaptive
balanced domain prioritization algorithm is proposed to balance optimizing the
joint model on multiple domains simultaneously. The determined multi-path model
selectively shares parameters across domains in shared nodes while keeping
domain-specific parameters within non-shared nodes in individual domain paths.
This approach effectively reduces the total number of parameters and FLOPS,
encouraging positive knowledge transfer while mitigating negative interference
across domains. Extensive evaluations on the Visual Decathlon dataset
demonstrate that the proposed multi-path model achieves state-of-the-art
performance in terms of accuracy, model size, and FLOPS against other
approaches using MobileNetV3-like architectures. Furthermore, the proposed
method improves average accuracy over learning single-domain models

Combined with the onset criteria for acceleration-induced cavitation ($Ca_1<1$,

size to collapse is $T_c=\sqrt{2}\sqrt{lL_{\max}}\sqrt{\frac{\rho}{p_\infty}}$,
where $l$ is the length of the water column, $L_{\max}$ is the maximum bubble
length, $\rho$ is the liquid density, and $p_{\infty}$ is the reference
pressure in the far field. The analytical results are validated against
systematic experiments using a modified 'tube-arrest' apparatus, which can
decouple acceleration and velocity. The results in the current work can guide
design and operation of hydraulic systems encountering transient processes.

observed data. Despite its success in certain domains, most existing methods
focus on causal relations between observed variables, while in many scenarios
the observed ones may not be the underlying causal variables (e.g., image
pixels), but are generated by latent causal variables or confounders that are
causally related. To this end, in this paper, we consider Linear, Non-Gaussian
Latent variable Models (LiNGLaMs), in which latent confounders are also
causally related, and propose a Generalized Independent Noise (GIN) condition
to estimate such latent variable graphs. Specifically, for two observed random
vectors $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$, GIN holds if and only if
$\omega^{\intercal}\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$ are statistically independent,
where $\omega$ is a parameter vector characterized from the cross-covariance
between $\mathbf{Y}$ and $\mathbf{Z}$. From the graphical view, roughly
speaking, GIN implies that causally earlier latent common causes of variables
in $\mathbf{Y}$ d-separate $\mathbf{Y}$ from $\mathbf{Z}$. Interestingly, we
find that the independent noise condition, i.e., if there is no confounder,
causes are independent from the error of regressing the effect on the causes,
can be seen as a special case of GIN. Moreover, we show that GIN helps locate
latent variables and identify their causal structure, including causal
directions. We further develop a recursive learning algorithm to achieve these
goals. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

mechanical phenomena.
  In the Higgs mechanism, the weak gauge bosons acquire masses by interacting
with a scalar field, leading to a vector boson mass matrix. On the other hand,
a rigid body accelerated through an inviscid, incompressible and irrotational
fluid feels an opposing force linear in its acceleration, via an added-mass
tensor. We uncover a physical analogy between these effects and propose a
dictionary relating them. The correspondence turns the gauge Lie algebra into
the space of directions in which the body can move, encodes the pattern of
symmetry breaking in the shape of an associated body and relates symmetries of
the body to those of the vacuum manifold. The new viewpoint raises interesting
questions, notably on the fluid analogs of the broken symmetry and Higgs
particle.
  Ideal gas dynamics can develop shock-like singularities which are typically
regularized through viscosity. In 1d, discontinuities can also be dispersively
smoothed. In the 2nd part, we develop a minimal conservative regularization of
3d adiabatic flow of a gas with exponent $\gamma$, by adding a capillarity
energy $\beta_* (\nabla \rho)^2/\rho$ to the Hamiltonian. This leads to a
nonlinear force with 3 derivatives of $\rho$, while preserving the conservation
laws of mass and entropy. Our model admits dispersive sound, solitary &
periodic traveling waves, but no steady continuous shock-like solutions.
Nevertheless, in 1d, for $\gamma = 2$, numerical solutions in periodic domains
show recurrence & avoidance of gradient catastrophes via solitons with
phase-shift scattering. This is explained via an equivalence of our model (for
homentropic potential flow in any dimension) with a defocussing nonlinear
Schr\""odinger equation (NLS, cubic for $\gamma = 2$). Thus, our model
generalizes KdV & NLS to adiabatic gas flow in any dimension.

two very wide hyperbolic frequency windows from 0.41 eV (99 THz) to 2.90 eV
(701 THz), and from 3.63 eV (878 THz) to 5.54 eV (1340 THz). The former window

Markov-switching models to a time-varying probability by including information
from observations. An important feature in this proof is the mixing rate of the
regime process conditional on the observations, which is time varying owing to
the time-varying transition probabilities. Consistency and asymptotic normality
follow from the almost deterministic geometrically decaying bound of the mixing
rate. The assumptions are verified in regime-switching autoregressive models
with widely-applied TVTP specifications. A simulation study examines the
finite-sample distributions of the MLE and compares the estimates of the
asymptotic variance constructed from the Hessian matrix and the outer product

and dexterity in robotic grasping manipulation is far from explored. This work
presents an origami-based shape morphing fingertip design to actively tackle
the grasping stability and dexterity problems. The proposed fingertip utilizes
origami as its skeleton providing degrees of freedom at desired positions and
motor-driven four-bar-linkages as its transmission components to achieve a
compact size of the fingertip. 3 morphing types that are commonly observed and
essential in robotic grasping are studied and validated with geometrical
modeling. Experiments including grasping an object with convex point contact to
pivot or do pinch grasping, grasped object reorientation, and enveloping
grasping with concave fingertip surfaces are implemented to demonstrate the
advantages of our fingertip compared to conventional parallel grippers.
Multi-functionality on enhancing grasping stability and dexterity via active
adaptation given different grasped objects and manipulation tasks are
justified. Video is available at youtu.be/jJoJ3xnDdVk/.

on a random contact rate: Many individuals become infected synchronously in
single contact events. We use the branching-process approach for contact
tracing to analyze the impact of super-spreader events on the effect of contact
tracing. Here we neglect a tracing delay. Roughly speaking, we find that
contact tracing is more efficient in the presence of super-spreaders if the
fraction of symptomatics is small, the tracing probability is high, or the
latency period is distinctively larger than the incubation period. In other
cases, the effect of contact tracing can be decreased by super-spreaders.
Numerical analysis with parameters suited for SARS-CoV-2 indicates that
super-spreaders do not decrease the effect of contact tracing crucially in case
of that infection.

based on the assumption: they are correlated with test effectiveness (i.e., the
generation of adversarial test inputs or the error-revealing capability of test

neural networks (DNNs). Although the standard BN can significantly accelerate
the training of DNNs and improve the generalization performance, it has several
underlying limitations which may hamper the performance in both training and
inference. In the training stage, BN relies on estimating the mean and variance
of data using a single minibatch. Consequently, BN can be unstable when the
batch size is very small or the data is poorly sampled. In the inference stage,
BN often uses the so called moving mean and moving variance instead of batch
statistics, i.e., the training and inference rules in BN are not consistent.
Regarding these issues, we propose a memorized batch normalization (MBN), which
considers multiple recent batches to obtain more accurate and robust
statistics. Note that after the SGD update for each batch, the model parameters
will change, and the features will change accordingly, leading to the
Distribution Shift before and after the update for the considered batch. To
alleviate this issue, we present a simple Double-Forward scheme in MBN which
can further improve the performance. Compared to related methods, the proposed
MBN exhibits consistent behaviors in both training and inference. Empirical
results show that the MBN based models trained with the Double-Forward scheme
greatly reduce the sensitivity of data and significantly improve the

the MPO decomposition format before training. In experiment, this process is
applied to the causal neural network models, such as the feedforward multilayer

achieved with respect to low compression rates. Our proposal provides an

problems of interest are discretized with an unfitted mesh Finite Element
Method. We construct and investigate a unified and geometry independent reduced
basis which overcomes many barriers and complications of the past, that may
occur whenever geometrical morphings are taking place. By employing a geometry
independent reduced basis, we are able to avoid remeshing and transformation to
reference configurations, and we are able to handle complex geometries. This
combination of a fixed background mesh in a fixed extended background geometry
with reduced order techniques appears beneficial and advantageous in many
industrial and engineering applications, which could not be resolved
efficiently in the past.

  Control Center Applications",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent cyber-attacks on power grids highlight the necessity to protect the
critical functionalities of a control center vital for the safe operation of a
grid. Even in a distributed framework one central control center acts as a
coordinator in majority of the control center architectures. Such a control
center can become a prime target for cyber as well as physical attacks, and,
hence, a single point failure can lead to complete loss of visibility of the
power grid. If the control center which runs the critical functions in a
distributed computing environment can be randomly chosen between the available
control centers in a secure framework, the ability of the attacker in causing a
single point failure can be reduced to a great extent. To achieve this, a novel
distributed hierarchy based framework to secure critical functions is proposed
in this paper. The proposed framework ensures that the data aggregation and the
critical functions are carried out at a random location, and incorporates
security features such as attestation and trust management to detect
compromised agents. A theoretical result is proved on the evolution and
convergence of the trust values in the proposed trust management protocol. It
is also shown that the system is nominally robust so long as the number of
compromised nodes is strictly less than one-half of the nodes minus 1. For
demonstration, a Kalman filter-based state estimation using phasor measurements
is used as the critical function to be secured. The proposed framework's
implementation feasibility is tested on a physical hardware cluster of
Parallella boards. The framework is also validated using simulations on the
IEEE 118 bus system.

element as a player in a game: a quest for the best element quality. In other
words, each player has the goal of becoming as regular as possible. The set of
strategies for each element is given by all translations of its vertices.
Ideally, he would like to quantify this regularity using a quality measure
which corresponds to the utility function in game theory. Each player is aware
of the other players' utility functions as well as their set of strategies,
which is analogous to his own utility function and strategies. In the simplest
case, the utility functions only depend on the regularity. In more complicated
cases this utility function depends on the element size, the curvature, or even
the solution to a differential equation. This article is a sketch of a possible
game-theoretical approach to mesh smoothing and still on-going research.

especially in pixel-level semantic segmentation. The mainstream methods adopt
the self-attention mechanism to model global context information. However,
pixels belonging to different classes usually have weak feature correlation.
Modeling the global pixel-level correlation matrix indiscriminately is
extremely redundant in the self-attention mechanism. In order to solve the
above problem, we propose a hierarchical context network to differentially
model homogeneous pixels with strong correlations and heterogeneous pixels with
weak correlations. Specifically, we first propose a multi-scale guided
pre-segmentation module to divide the entire feature map into different
classed-based homogeneous regions. Within each homogeneous region, we design
the pixel context module to capture pixel-level correlations. Subsequently,
different from the self-attention mechanism that still models weak
heterogeneous correlations in a dense pixel-level manner, the region context
module is proposed to model sparse region-level dependencies using a unified
representation of each region. Through aggregating fine-grained pixel context
features and coarse-grained region context features, our proposed network can
not only hierarchically model global context information but also harvest
multi-granularity representations to more robustly identify multi-scale
objects. We evaluate our approach on Cityscapes and the ISPRS Vaihingen
dataset. Without Bells or Whistles, our approach realizes a mean IoU of 82.8%
and overall accuracy of 91.4% on Cityscapes and ISPRS Vaihingen test set,

superconducting artificial atom. The system can be pumped coherently via a
two-photon process, and to achieve high population inversion, the relaxation
rate of the metastable state is increased via an auxiliary low-Q cavity coupled
to a transition between the transmon excited states. We show numerically that
such a maser can operate both in the intermediate coupling regime with
super-Poissonian photon statistics and in the strong coupling regime, where the
statistics is sub-Poissonian. For the former, the maser exhibits thresholdless
behavior and for the latter, there is a well-defined pumping threshold. A
useful side-effect of the auxiliary resonator is that it allows to overcome the
photon blockade effect for the pump, which would otherwise prevent high photon
population. Finally, we observe the bistability of the steady-state Wigner
function and the self-quenching effect for some parameters.

  https://scholarworks.umass.edu/scil/vol4/iss1/38/",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Previous work suggests that RNNs trained on natural language corpora can
capture number agreement well for simple sentences but perform less well when
sentences contain agreement attractors: intervening nouns between the verb and
the main subject with grammatical number opposite to the latter. This suggests
these models may not learn the actual syntax of agreement, but rather infer
shallower heuristics such as `agree with the recent noun'. In this work, we
investigate RNN models with varying inductive biases trained on selectively
chosen `hard' agreement instances, i.e., sentences with at least one agreement
attractor. For these the verb number cannot be predicted using a simple linear
heuristic, and hence they might help provide the model additional cues for
hierarchical syntax. If RNNs can learn the underlying agreement rules when
trained on such hard instances, then they should generalize well to other
sentences, including simpler ones. However, we observe that several RNN types,
including the ONLSTM which has a soft structural inductive bias, surprisingly
fail to perform well on sentences without attractors when trained solely on
sentences with attractors. We analyze how these selectively trained RNNs
compare to the baseline (training on a natural distribution of agreement
attractors) along the dimensions of number agreement accuracy, representational
similarity, and performance across different syntactic constructions. Our
findings suggest that RNNs trained on our hard agreement instances still do not
capture the underlying syntax of agreement, but rather tend to overfit the
training distribution in a way which leads them to perform poorly on `easy'
out-of-distribution instances. Thus, while RNNs are powerful models which can
pick up non-trivial dependency patterns, inducing them to do so at the level of
syntax rather than surface remains a challenge.

observing the heading direction, and exploring the previously unseen area. With
the sensing result, a flight path is then planned based on real-time sampling

an active sense and avoid (ASAA) system. Experiments in both simulation and the

this system provides a low-cost and effective approach to overcome the FOV

are essential in multi-agent reinforcement learning. However, real-world
multi-agent systems suffer from restrictions on limited-bandwidth
communication. If the bandwidth is fully occupied, some agents are not able to
send messages promptly to others, causing decision delay and impairing
cooperative effects. Recent related work has started to address the problem but
still fails in maximally reducing the consumption of communication resources.
In this paper, we propose Event-Triggered Communication Network (ETCNet) to
enhance the communication efficiency in multi-agent systems by sending messages
only when necessary. According to the information theory, the limited bandwidth
is translated to the penalty threshold of an event-triggered strategy, which
determines whether an agent at each step sends a message or not. Then the
design of the event-triggered strategy is formulated as a constrained Markov
decision problem, and reinforcement learning finds the best communication
protocol that satisfies the limited bandwidth constraint. Experiments on
typical multi-agent tasks demonstrate that ETCNet outperforms other methods in
terms of the reduction of bandwidth occupancy and still preserves the
cooperative performance of multi-agent systems at the most.

expand into the plasma of the accretion disk corona. We inject a pair plasma at
a simulation boundary with a mildly relativistic temperature and mean speed. It
flows across a spatially uniform electron-proton plasma, which is permeated by
a background magnetic field. The magnetic field is aligned with one simulation
direction and oriented orthogonally to the mean velocity vector of the pair

its front. It is amplified to a value large enough to trap ambient electrons.
The current of the trapped electrons, which are carried with the expanding

grows and changes into a piston after it saturated. Our simulations show that
this piston undergoes a collision-less instability similar to a Rayleigh-Taylor

use Markov boundary information to identify a specific variable that can be
removed from the set of variables without affecting the statistical

discover its neighborhood, remove that variable from the set of variables, and
recursively learn the causal structure over the remaining variables. We further
provide a lower bound on the number of CI tests required by any

demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed approach. Our experimental results

framework combines two types of locally conservative discretization schemes:
(1) an enriched Galerkin method for reactive flow, and (2) a three-field mixed
finite element method for coupled fluid flow and solid deformation. This
combination ensures local mass conservation, which is critical to flow and
transport in heterogeneous porous media, with a relatively affordable
computational cost. A particular class of the framework is constructed for
calcite precipitation/dissolution reactions, incorporating their nonlinear
effects on the fluid viscosity and solid deformation. Linearization schemes and
algorithms for solving the nonlinear algebraic system are also presented.
Through numerical examples of various complexity, we demonstrate that the
proposed framework is a robust and efficient computational method for
simulation of reactive flow and transport in deformable porous media, even when
the material properties are strongly heterogeneous and anisotropic.

instead of limited raw texts or costly constructed knowledge bases, for the
commonsense reasoning problem in NLP. Our motivation comes from the fact that
an image is worth a thousand words, where richer scene information could be
leveraged to help distill the commonsense knowledge, which is often hidden in
languages. Our approach, namely Loire, consists of two stages. In the first
stage, a bi-modal sequence-to-sequence approach is utilized to conduct the
scene layout generation task, based on a text representation model ViBERT. In
this way, the required visual scene knowledge, such as spatial relations, will
be encoded in ViBERT by the supervised learning process with some bi-modal data
like COCO. Then ViBERT is concatenated with a pre-trained language model to
perform the downstream commonsense reasoning tasks. Experimental results on two
commonsense reasoning problems, i.e. commonsense question answering and pronoun
resolution, demonstrate that Loire outperforms traditional language-based
methods. We also give some case studies to show what knowledge is learned from
images and explain how the generated scene layout helps the commonsense

inlet in a freestream Mach number of $M_\infty=5$ is numerically solved to
understand the unsteady throttling dynamics. Throttling conditions are
simulated by varying the exit area of the isolator in the form of plug insets.
Different throttling ratios between $0\leq \zeta \leq 0.7$ in steps of 0.1 are
considered. No unsteadiness is observed for $\zeta\leq 0.2$ and severe
unsteadiness is found for $0.3 \leq \zeta \leq 0.7$. The frequency of
unsteadiness ($f$) increases rapidly with $\zeta$. As $\zeta$ increases, the
amount of reversed mass inside the isolator scales with the frequency and the
exit mass flow rate. A general framework is attempted to scale the unsteady
events based on the gathered knowledge from the numerical study. The
inlet-isolator flow is modeled as an oscillating flow through a duct with known
upstream design conditions like the freestream Mach number ($M_\infty$) and the
isolator inlet Mach number ($M_i$). Factors like the mass occupied by the duct
volume, the characteristic unsteady frequency, throttling ratio, and the exit
mass flow rate through the duct are used to form a non-dimensional parameter
$\beta$, which scales with the upstream design parameter $\xi=M_i/M_\infty$.
The scaling parameters are further exploited to formulate a semi-empirical
relation using the existing experimental results at different throttling ratios
from the open literature. The unsteady frequencies from the present
two-dimensional numerical exercise are also shown to agree with the proposed
scaling and the resulting semi-empirical relation.

effectiveness of individual embedding types in consideration for a task, and
updates the belief based on a reward. We follow strategies in reinforcement

augmentation technique can be very useful for supervised learning problems,
autoencoders typically fail to generalize transformations from data

distillation objective for structured prediction, which is tractable for many

of total cross-section 17,600 sq km (albedo 0.1 assumed) and mass 1.2e9 kg,
this being about 1e-4 of the mass of the nucleus, taken as a sphere of radius
1.5 km and density 500 kg/m3. While the rising phase of the outburst was very
steep (brightness doubling time of hours), subsequent fading occurred slowly
(fading timescales increasing from weeks to months), as large, low velocity
particles drifted away from the nucleus. A simple model of the fading
lightcurve indicates that the ejected particles occupied a broad range of
sizes, from microns to centimeters, and followed a differential power-law
distribution with index 3.6+/-0.1 (similar to that in other comets). The
fastest particles had speeds 210 m/s, indicating gas-drag acceleration of small
grains well-coupled to the flow. Low energy processes known to drive mass loss
in active asteroids, including rotational disruption, thermal and desiccation
stress cracking, and electrostatic repulsion, cannot generate the high
particles speeds measured in P/Vales, and are discounted. Impact origin is
unlikely given the short dynamical lifetimes of the quasi-Hildas and the low
collision probabilities of these objects. The specific energy of the ejecta is
estimated at 220 J/kg. The outburst follows a series of encounters with Jupiter

we compare our results with six state-of-the-art algorithms based on
traditional computer vision techniques by means of similarity measures that
compare the reference hairless image and the one with hair simulated. Finally,

present a general method, a combination of the Chern-Simons fermionization and
the Wess-Zumino-Witten theory, to study the quantum impurity in Dirac spin
liquids. Under the Chern-Simons fermionization, the gauge fluctuations are
apparently suppressed and the low-energy physics is described by a number of
Dirac valleys with valley-dependent pseudospin-momentum locking. The (2+1)D
effective theory can be further reduced into the (1+1)D Wess-Zumino-Witten
theory by rotational symmetry, where the pseudospin-exchange between Dirac
fermions and the impurity can then be solved by the non-Abelian bosonization.
Consequently, fixed points of Fermi liquid and non-Fermi liquid are identified,
respectively, depending on the relevance of the impurity scattering among the
Dirac valleys. This leads to experimental fingerprints for Dirac spin liquids,
including a Kondo-induced magneto-thermal effect, a non-monotonous thermal
conductivity during the crossover, and an anisotropic spin correlation
function.

efficiently judge the credibility of a movie review and the number of movie

credibility that judges the credibility of reviews based on the historical
ratings and textual reviews written by each reviewer. For this, we present
three kinds of criteria that can clearly classify the reviews into trusted or
distrusted ones. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed historical
credibility through extensive analysis. Specifically, we show that
characteristics between the trusted or distrusted reviews are quite
distinguishable in terms of three viewpoints: 1) distribution, 2) statistics,
and 3) correlation. Then, we apply historical credibility to a weakly
supervised model to classify a given review as a trusted or distrusted one.
First, we show that it is significantly efficient because the entire data set
is annotated according to the predefined criteria. Indeed, it can annotate
6,400 movie reviews only in 0.093 seconds, which occupy only 0.55%~1.88% of the
total learning time when we use LSTM and SVM as the learning model. Second, we
show that the historical credibility-based classification model clearly
outperforms the textual review-based classification model. Specifically, the
classification accuracy of the former outperforms that of the latter by up to
11.7%~13.4%. In addition, we clearly confirm that our classification model
shows higher accuracy as the data size increases.

calibration between 3.3 $\mu m$ PAH emission and star formation rate, but also
find regimes where it loses reliability, including at high luminosity and low
metallicity. The 3.4 $\mu m$ aliphatic emission and a broad plateau feature
centered at 3.47 $\mu m$ are also modeled. As the shortest wavelength PAH
feature, 3.3 $\mu m$ is susceptible to attenuation, leading to a factor of
$\sim$ 3 differences in the inferred star formation rate at high obscuration
with different assumed attenuation geometries. Surprisingly, $L_\mathrm{PAH\,
3.3} / L_\mathrm{\Sigma\, PAH}$ shows no sign of decline at high luminosities,
and the low metallicity dwarf galaxy II Zw 40 exhibits an unusually strong 3.3
$\mu m$ band; both results suggest either that the smallest PAHs are better
able to survive under intense radiation fields than presumed, or that PAH
emission is shifted to shorter wavelengths in intense and high energy radiation
environments. A photometric surrogate for 3.3 $\mu m$ PAH luminosity using
JWST/NIRCam is provided and found to be highly reliable at low redshift.

Normalization (pAdaIN), reduces the representation of global statistics in the

that rearranges the samples in a given batch. Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) is then applied between the activations of each (non-permuted) sample
$i$ and the corresponding activations of the sample $\pi(i)$, thus swapping
statistics between the samples of the batch. Since the global image statistics
are distorted, this swapping procedure causes the network to rely on cues, such

If insufficient attention is given to support issues, however, their escalation
to management becomes time-consuming and expensive, especially for large
organizations managing hundreds of customers and thousands of support tickets.
Our work provides a step towards simplifying the job of support analysts and
managers, particularly in predicting the risk of escalating support tickets. In
a field study at our large industrial partner, IBM, we used a design science
research methodology to characterize the support process and data available to
IBM analysts in managing escalations. We then implemented these features into a
machine learning model to predict support ticket escalations. We trained and
evaluated our machine learning model on over 2.5 million support tickets and
10,000 escalations, obtaining a recall of 87.36% and an 88.23% reduction in the
workload for support analysts looking to identify support tickets at risk of
escalation. Finally, in addition to these research evaluation activities, we
compared the performance of our support ticket model with that of a model
developed with no feature engineering; the support ticket model features
outperformed the non-engineered model. The artifacts created in this research
are designed to serve as a starting place for organizations interested in
predicting support ticket escalations, and for future researchers to build on
to advance research in escalation prediction.

time series data when the distribution of the time series changes
significantly. There are many sophisticated statistical algorithms for solving
changepoint detection problem, although there is not much work devoted towards
gradual changepoints as compared to abrupt ones. Here we present a new approach
to solve changepoint detection problem using fuzzy rough set theory which is
able to detect such gradual changepoints. An expression for the rough-fuzzy
estimate of changepoints is derived along with its mathematical properties
concerning fast computation. In a statistical hypothesis testing framework,
asymptotic distribution of the proposed statistic on both single and multiple
changepoints is derived under null hypothesis enabling multiple changepoint
detection. Extensive simulation studies have been performed to investigate how
simple crude statistical measures of disparity can be subjected to improve
their efficiency in estimation of gradual changepoints. Also, the said
rough-fuzzy estimate is robust to signal-to-noise ratio, high degree of
fuzziness in true changepoints and also to hyper parameter values. Simulation
studies reveal that the proposed method beats other fuzzy methods and also
popular crisp methods like WBS, PELT and BOCD in detecting gradual
changepoints. The applicability of the estimate is demonstrated using multiple
real-life datasets including Covid-19. We have developed the python package

analyse interburst periods and their statistics. We study here the phase-space
of a mean-field model, based on synaptic short-term changes, that exhibit burst
and interburst dynamics and we identify that interburst corresponds to the
escape from a basin of attraction. Using stochastic simulations, we report here
that the distribution of the these durations do not match with the time to
reach the boundary. We further analyse this phenomenon by studying a generic
class of two-dimensional dynamical systems perturbed by small noise that
exhibits two peculiar behaviors: 1- the maximum associated to the probability
density function is not located at the point attractor, which came as a
surprise. The distance between the maximum and the attractor increases with the
noise amplitude $\sigma$, as we show using WKB approximation and numerical
simulations. 2- For such systems, exiting from the basin of attraction is not
sufficient to characterize the entire escape time, due to trajectories that can
return several times inside the basin of attraction after crossing the
boundary, before eventually escaping far away. To conclude, long-interburst
durations are inherent properties of the dynamics and sould be expected in
empirical time series.

the efforts of the community to derive an explicit solution. The present work
demonstrates that this is a non-trivial task. Notably, it is proven that the
explicit solution of the model requires the introduction of a new
transcendental special function, related to the Wright's Omega function. The
present manuscript reports new analytical results and numerical routines
suitable for parametric estimation of the SIR model. The manuscript introduces
iterative algorithms approximating the incidence variable, which allows for
estimation of the model parameters from the numbers of observed cases. The

making is an important but mostly neglected factor in this domain. Much of the
existing methods that claim to be online, depend on batch or offline processing
in practice. Motivated by these research gaps, we propose an online anomaly
detection method in surveillance videos with asymptotic bounds on the false
alarm rate, which in turn provides a clear procedure for selecting a proper
decision threshold that satisfies the desired false alarm rate. Our proposed
algorithm consists of a multi-objective deep learning module along with a
statistical anomaly detection module, and its effectiveness is demonstrated on
several publicly available data sets where we outperform the state-of-the-art

that of classical waves. Only when we bring in observers the fundamentally
different quantum reality emerges. Similarly the introduction of observers
changes the nature of spacetime by causing a split between past and future,
concepts that are not well defined in the observer-free world. The induced
temporal boundary leads to a resonance condition for the oscillatory vacuum
solutions of the metric in Euclidean time. It corresponds to an exponential de
Sitter evolution in real time, which can be represented by a cosmological
constant $\Lambda =2\pi^2/r_u^2$, where $r_u$ is the radius of the particle
horizon at the epoch when the observer exists. For the present epoch we get a
value of $\Lambda$ that agrees with the observed value within $2\sigma$ of the
observational errors. This explanation resolves the cosmic coincidence problem.
Our epoch in cosmic history does not herald the onset of an inflationary phase
driven by some dark energy. We show that the observed accelerated expansion
that is deduced from the redshifts is an ""edge effect"" due to the
observer-induced boundary and not representative of the intrinsic evolution.
The new theory satisfies the BBN (Big Bang nucleosynthesis) and CMB (cosmic
microwave background) observational constraints equally well as the concordance
model of standard cosmology. There is no link between the dark energy and dark
matter problems. Previous conclusions that dark matter is mainly non-baryonic
are not affected.

computationally feasible. Moreover, we adopt efficient sampling theory to
achieve further computational savings. We show that these developments allow
the construction of more expressive hybrid models that achieve state-of-the-art

  Nasrabadi","Cross-Spectral Iris Matching Using Conditional Coupled GAN","International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB-2020)",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Cross-spectral iris recognition is emerging as a promising biometric approach
to authenticating the identity of individuals. However, matching iris images
acquired at different spectral bands shows significant performance degradation
when compared to single-band near-infrared (NIR) matching due to the spectral
gap between iris images obtained in the NIR and visual-light (VIS) spectra.
Although researchers have recently focused on deep-learning-based approaches to
recover invariant representative features for more accurate recognition
performance, the existing methods cannot achieve the expected accuracy required
for commercial applications. Hence, in this paper, we propose a conditional
coupled generative adversarial network (CpGAN) architecture for cross-spectral
iris recognition by projecting the VIS and NIR iris images into a
low-dimensional embedding domain to explore the hidden relationship between
them. The conditional CpGAN framework consists of a pair of GAN-based networks,
one responsible for retrieving images in the visible domain and other
responsible for retrieving images in the NIR domain. Both networks try to map
the data into a common embedding subspace to ensure maximum pair-wise
similarity between the feature vectors from the two iris modalities of the same
subject. To prove the usefulness of our proposed approach, extensive
experimental results obtained on the PolyU dataset are compared to existing
state-of-the-art cross-spectral recognition methods.

to sanitize data so as to prevent leakage of sensitive information that is
present in the raw data, while ensuring that the sanitized data is still
compatible with the service provider's legacy inference system. We develop an
inference privacy framework based on the variational method and include maximum
mean discrepancy and domain adaption as techniques to regularize the domain of
the sanitized data to ensure its legacy compatibility. However, the variational
method leads to weak privacy in cases where the underlying data distribution is
hard to approximate. It may also face difficulties when handling continuous
private variables. To overcome this, we propose an alternative formulation of
the privacy metric using maximal correlation and we present empirical methods
to estimate it. Finally, we develop a deep learning model as an example of the
proposed inference privacy framework. Numerical experiments verify the

are used in numerous applications including computer vision, autonomous

great interest as inaccurate prediction could result in safety concerns and
limit the adoption of AI systems. In this paper, we propose a framework based
on design of experiments to systematically investigate the robustness of AI
classification algorithms. A robust classification algorithm is expected to
have high accuracy and low variability under different application scenarios.
The robustness can be affected by a wide range of factors such as the imbalance
of class labels in the training dataset, the chosen prediction algorithm, the
chosen dataset of the application, and a change of distribution in the training
and test datasets. To investigate the robustness of AI classification
algorithms, we conduct a comprehensive set of mixture experiments to collect
prediction performance results. Then statistical analyses are conducted to
understand how various factors affect the robustness of AI classification
algorithms. We summarize our findings and provide suggestions to practitioners
