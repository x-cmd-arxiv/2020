ecological and domestic significance. Apart from being and indicator for e.g.
food availability, ecological change and population size, it is also a source
of conflict between humans and birds. Moreover, massive gatherings or colonies
of birds also get the attention of the public -- either as a spectacular
phenomenon or as an unwelcome pest -- thereby forming the public perception of
birds and their abundance. In the context of the mass concentration of
bramblings (Fringilla montifringilla) in Sweden the winter 2019-2020, this work
reviews the literature on this striking phenomenon. Winter roosts are found to
amount to on the order of one million birds per hectare of roost area, but the
spread between reports is significant. Support for roosts of up to around 15
million birds was found, but much larger numbers are frequently recited in the
literature. It is argued that these larger numbers are the result of
overestimation or, in some cases, even completely unfounded (potentially
typos). While the difficulties related to the count of large numbers of birds
can explain this state, it is unfortunate that ""high numbers"" sometimes
displace proper numbers. Since incorrect data, and its persistence, may result
in that incorrect conclusions are drawn from new observations, this matter
deserves attention. As the Brambling is a well-studied species, the matter also
raises concerns regarding numbers for mass concentrations of other species. It
is recommended that very large numbers of birds should be recited and used with
care: underlying data and methods of the original sources should be
scrutinized. Analogously, reporters of large numbers of birds are advised to
describe and document counting methods. In particular, number estimates based
on flock volume and bird density should be avoided.

important to be able to fingerprint them, for example in order to detect if
there are misbehaving or even malicious IoT devices in one's network. The aim
of this paper is to provide a systematic categorisation of machine learning
augmented techniques that can be used for fingerprinting IoT devices. This can
serve as a baseline for comparing various IoT fingerprinting mechanisms, so
that network administrators can choose one or more mechanisms that are
appropriate for monitoring and maintaining their network. We carried out an
extensive literature review of existing papers on fingerprinting IoT devices --
paying close attention to those with machine learning features. This is
followed by an extraction of important and comparable features among the
mechanisms outlined in those papers. As a result, we came up with a key set of
terminologies that are relevant both in the fingerprinting context and in the
IoT domain. This enabled us to construct a framework called IDWork, which can
be used for categorising existing IoT fingerprinting mechanisms in a way that
will facilitate a coherent and fair comparison of these mechanisms. We found
that the majority of the IoT fingerprinting mechanisms take a passive approach
-- mainly through network sniffing -- instead of being intrusive and
interactive with the device of interest. Additionally, a significant number of
the surveyed mechanisms employ both static and dynamic approaches, in order to
benefit from complementary features that can be more robust against certain
attacks such as spoofing and replay attacks.

Following what has been done for the 2D scalar case, the idea is to work in
weighted Sobolev spaces, adding to the space the so-called outgoing propagating
singularities. The analysis requires new results of scalar and vector potential
representations of singular fields. The outgoing behaviour is selected via the
limiting absorption principle.

$B^\pm\to D K^\pm$ and $B^\pm\to D \pi^\pm$, where the $D$ meson is
reconstructed in one of the self-conjugate three-body final states $K_{\mathrm
S}\pi^+\pi^-$ and $K_{\mathrm S}K^+K^-$ (commonly denoted $K_{\mathrm S}
h^+h^-$). The decays are analysed in bins of the $D$-decay phase space, leading
to a measurement that is independent of the modelling of the $D$-decay
amplitude. The observables are interpreted in terms of the CKM angle $\gamma$.
Using a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of
$9\,\text{fb}^{-1}$ collected in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass
energies of $7$, $8$, and $13\,\text{TeV}$ with the LHCb experiment, $\gamma$
is measured to be $\left(68.7^{+5.2}_{-5.1}\right)^\circ$. The hadronic
parameters $r_B^{DK}$, $r_B^{D\pi}$, $\delta_B^{DK}$, and $\delta_B^{D\pi}$,
which are the ratios and strong-phase differences of the suppressed and
favoured $B^\pm$ decays, are also reported.

analogous to a coarse graining procedure commonly used to study phase
transitions in physical systems. In a recent paper, opinion dynamics models
manifesting a phase transition, were shown to be able to explain the cases when
a candidate winning more number of popular votes could still lose the general
election on the basis of the electoral college system. We explore the
dependence of such possibilities on various factors like the number of states
and total population (i.e., system sizes) and get an interesting scaling
behavior. In comparison with the real data, it is shown that the probability of
the minority win, calculated within the model assumptions, is indeed near the
highest possible value. In addition, we also implement a two step coarse
graining procedure, relevant for both opinion dynamics and information theory.

yet to be fully uncovered. Clinical studies on high-risk populations, such as
contact sports athletes, have become more common and give insight on the link
between impact severity and brain injury risk through the use of wearable
sensors and neurological testing. However, as the number of institutions
operating these studies grows, there is a growing need for a platform to share
these data to facilitate our understanding of concussion mechanisms and aid in
the development of suitable diagnostic tools. To that end, this paper puts
forth two contributions: 1) a centralized, open-source platform for storing and
sharing head impact data, in collaboration with the Federal Interagency
Traumatic Brain Injury Research informatics system (FITBIR), and 2) a deep
learning impact detection algorithm (MiGNet) to differentiate between true head
impacts and false positives for the previously biomechanically validated
instrumented mouthguard sensor (MiG2.0), all of which easily interfaces with
FITBIR. We report 96% accuracy using MiGNet, based on a neural network model,
improving on previous work based on Support Vector Machines achieving 91%
accuracy, on an out of sample dataset of high school and collegiate football
head impacts. The integrated MiG2.0 and FITBIR system serve as a collaborative
research tool to be disseminated across multiple institutions towards creating
a standardized dataset for furthering the knowledge of concussion biomechanics.

engineered nanoparticles for applications in catalysis, energy materials,
composites, and more. FSP instruments are highly dependent on a number of
adjustable parameters, including fuel injection rate, fuel-oxygen mixtures, and
temperature, which can greatly affect the quality, quantity, and properties of
the yielded nanoparticles. Optimizing FSP synthesis requires monitoring,
analyzing, characterizing, and modifying experimental conditions.Here, we
propose a hybrid CPU-GPU Difference of Gaussians (DoG)method for characterizing
the volume distribution of unburnt solution, so as to enable near-real-time
optimization and steering of FSP experiments. Comparisons against standard
implementations show our method to be an order of magnitude more efficient.
This surrogate signal can be deployed as a component of an online end-to-end
pipeline that maximizes the synthesis yield.

  Specification for Bayesian Neural Networks",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Bayesian neural networks attempt to combine the strong predictive performance
of neural networks with formal quantification of uncertainty associated with
the predictive output in the Bayesian framework. However, it remains unclear
how to endow the parameters of the network with a prior distribution that is
meaningful when lifted into the output space of the network. A possible
solution is proposed that enables the user to posit an appropriate Gaussian
process covariance function for the task at hand. Our approach constructs a
prior distribution for the parameters of the network, called a ridgelet prior,
that approximates the posited Gaussian process in the output space of the
network. In contrast to existing work on the connection between neural networks
and Gaussian processes, our analysis is non-asymptotic, with finite sample-size
error bounds provided. This establishes the universality property that a
Bayesian neural network can approximate any Gaussian process whose covariance
function is sufficiently regular. Our experimental assessment is limited to a
proof-of-concept, where we demonstrate that the ridgelet prior can out-perform
an unstructured prior on regression problems for which a suitable Gaussian
process prior can be provided.

algorithms. In a recent work, Rasmussen et al. (Phys. Rev. A 101, 022308)
proposed an efficient single-step method for a prototypical multi-qubit gate, a
Toffoli gate, based on a combination of Ising interactions between control
qubits and an appropriate driving field on a target qubit. Trapped ions are a
natural platform to implement this method, since Ising interactions mediated by
phonons have been demonstrated in increasingly large ion crystals. However, the
simultaneous application of these interactions and the driving field required
for the gate results in undesired entanglement between the qubits and the
motion of the ions, reducing the gate fidelity. In this work, we propose a
solution based on adiabatic switching of these phonon mediated Ising
interactions. We study the effects of imperfect ground state cooling, and use
spin-echo techniques to undo unwanted phase accumulation in the achievable
fidelities. For gates coupling to all axial modes of a linear crystal, we
calculate high fidelities ($>$ 99%) $N$-qubit rotations with $N=$ 3-7 ions
cooled to their ground state of motion and a gate time below 1~ms. The high
fidelities obtained also for large crystals could make the gate competitive
with gate-decomposed, multi-step variants of the $N$-qubit Toffoli gate, at the
expense of requiring ground state cooling of the ion crystal.

high-resolution N-body simulation. We consider fixed number density samples
where galaxies are selected by either their H$\alpha$, [OIII]$\lambda 5007$ or
[OII]$\lambda \lambda 3727-3729$ emission line luminosities. We investigate the
assembly bias signatures of these samples, and compare them to those of stellar
mass and SFR selected samples. Interestingly, we find that the [OIII]- and
[OII]-selected samples display scale-dependent bias on large scales and that
their assembly bias signatures are also scale-dependent. Both these effects are
more pronounced for lower number density samples. The [OIII] and [OII] emitters
that contribute most to the scale dependence tend to have a low gas-phase
metallicity and are preferentially found in low-density regions. We also
measure the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) feature and the $\beta$ parameter
related to the growth rate of overdensities. We find a slight tendency for the
BAO peak to shift toward smaller scales for [OII] emitters and that $\beta$ is
scale-dependent at large scales. Our results suggest that ELG samples include
environmental effects that should be modelled in order to remove potential
systematic errors that could affect the estimation of cosmological parameters.

linear polarisation in the MeV X-rays suggests that the relativistic jets
dominate in this regime as well, whereas a hot accretion flow dominates the
soft X-ray band. The origin of the GeV non-thermal emission is still debated,
with both leptonic and hadronic scenarios deemed to be viable. In this work, we
present results from a new semi-analytical, multi-zone jet model applied to the

profile, the magnetic field, and the energy density. Moreover, the model
combines these dynamical properties with a self-consistent radiative transfer

The cluster and vortical mean-field phenomena can be probed by excitation of
isoscalar monopole and dipole states in scattering of isoscalar particles such
as deuterons or $\alpha$ particles.
  Inelastically scattered $\alpha$ particles were momentum-analysed in the K600
magnetic spectrometer at iThemba LABS, Cape Town, South Africa. The scattered
particles were detected in two multi-wire drift chambers and two plastic
scintillators placed at the focal plane of the K600. In the theoretical
discussion, the QRPA and AMD+GCM were used.
  The QRPA calculations lead us to conclude that: i) the mean-field vorticity
appears mainly in dipole states with $K=1$, ii) the dipole (monopole) states
should have strong deformation-induced octupole (quadrupole) admixtures, and
iii) that near the $\alpha$-particle threshold, there should exist a collective
state (with $K=0$ for prolate nuclei and $K=1$ for oblate nuclei) with an
impressive octupole strength. The results of the AMD+GCM calculations suggest
that some observed states may have a mixed (mean-field + cluster) character or
correspond to particular cluster configurations.
  A tentative correspondence between observed states and theoretical states
from QRPA and AMD+GCM was established. The QRPA and AMD+GCM analysis shows that
low-energy isoscalar dipole states combine cluster and mean-field properties.
The QRPA calculations show that the low-energy vorticity is well localized in
$^{24}$Mg, fragmented in $^{26}$Mg, and absent in $^{28}$Si.

can always simulate the convolutional net (for a fixed task). Thus the training

provable sample complexity gap can be shown, for standard training algorithms.
We construct a single natural distribution on $\mathbb{R}^d\times\{\pm 1\}$ on

with most gradient-based methods from gaussian initialization) requires
$\Omega(d^2)$ samples to generalize while $O(1)$ samples suffice for

$\Omega(d^2/\varepsilon)$ gap. The proof relies on the fact that SGD on

deformation based on impact kinematics, the clinical application of these FE
head models is limited due to the time-consuming nature of FE simulations. This
work aims to accelerate the process of brain deformation calculation and thus
improve the potential for clinical applications. Methods: We propose a deep
learning head model with a five-layer deep neural network and feature
engineering, and trained and tested the model on 1803 total head impacts from a
combination of head model simulations and on-field college football and mixed
martial arts impacts. Results: The proposed deep learning head model can
calculate the maximum principal strain for every element in the entire brain in
less than 0.001s (with an average root mean squared error of 0.025, and with a
standard deviation of 0.002 over twenty repeats with random data partition and
model initialization). The contributions of various features to the predictive
power of the model were investigated, and it was noted that the features based
on angular acceleration were found to be more predictive than the features

brain strain with accuracy, and its applicability can even further be extended
by incorporating data from other types of head impacts. Significance: In
addition to the potential clinical application in real-time brain deformation
monitoring, this model will help researchers estimate the brain strain from a
large number of head impacts more efficiently than using FE models.

  Disentanglement",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fine-tuning deep neural networks pre-trained on large scale datasets is one
of the most practical transfer learning paradigm given limited quantity of
training samples. To obtain better generalization, using the starting point as
the reference (SPAR), either through weights or features, has been successfully
applied to transfer learning as a regularizer. However, due to the domain
discrepancy between the source and target task, there exists obvious risk of
negative transfer in a straightforward manner of knowledge preserving. In this
paper, we propose a novel transfer learning algorithm, introducing the idea of
Target-awareness REpresentation Disentanglement (TRED), where the relevant
knowledge with respect to the target task is disentangled from the original
source model and used as a regularizer during fine-tuning the target model.
Specifically, we design two alternative methods, maximizing the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (Max-MMD) and minimizing the mutual information (Min-MI), for the
representation disentanglement. Experiments on various real world datasets show
that our method stably improves the standard fine-tuning by more than 2% in
average. TRED also outperforms related state-of-the-art transfer learning
regularizers such as L2-SP, AT, DELTA, and BSS.

intelligible audio from a random latent vector. In this paper, we examine the
task of recovering the latent vector of both synthesized and real audio.
Previous works recovered latent vectors of given audio through an auto-encoder
inspired technique that trains an encoder network either in parallel with the
GAN or after the generator is trained. With our approach, we train a deep
residual neural network architecture to project audio synthesized by WaveGAN
into the corresponding latent space with near identical reconstruction
performance. To accommodate for the lack of an original latent vector for real
audio, we optimize the residual network on the perceptual loss between the real
audio samples and the reconstructed audio of the predicted latent vectors. In
the case of synthesized audio, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the ground
truth and recovered latent vector is minimized as well. We further investigated
the audio reconstruction performance when several gradient optimization steps
are applied to the predicted latent vector. Through our deep neural network
based method of training on real and synthesized audio, we are able to predict
a latent vector that corresponds to a reasonable reconstruction of real audio.
Even though we evaluated our method on WaveGAN, our proposed method is
universal and can be applied to any other GANs.

earth nickelates (RENiO$_{3-x}$) have emerged over the years as a rich platform
to study the interplay between the lattice, the electronic structure, and
ordered magnetism. In this study, we investigate the evolution of the
electronic and magnetic structure in thin films of RENiO$_{3-x}$, using a
combination of X-ray absorption spectroscopy and imaging, resonant X-ray

oxygen vacancies modify the electronic configuration within the Ni-O orbital
manifolds, leading to a dramatic evolution of long-range electronic transport
pathways despite the absence of nanoscale phase separation. Remarkably,
magnetism is robust to substantial levels of carrier doping, and only a
moderate weakening of the $(1/4, 1/4, 1/4)_{pc}$ antiferromagnetic order
parameter is observed, whereas the magnetic transition temperature is largely
unchanged. Only at a certain point long-range magnetism is abruptly erased
without an accompanying structural transition. We propose the progressive
disruption of the 3D magnetic superexchange pathways upon introduction of point
defects as the mechanism behind the sudden collapse of magnetic order in
oxygen-deficient nickelates. Our work demonstrates that, unlike most other
oxides, ordered magnetism in RENiO$_{3-x}$ is mostly insensitive to carrier
doping. The sudden collapse of ordered magnetism upon oxygen removal may
provide a new mechanism for solid-state magneto-ionic switching and new
applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Although some analysis and interpretation methods favor the presence of clouds

\times 10^{13}$ - $10^{15}$ G. They exhibit transient, highly energetic events,
such as short X-ray flashes, bursts and giant flares, all of which are powered
by their enormous magnetic energy. Quiescent magnetars have X-ray luminosities
between $10^{29}$ and $10^{35}$ erg/s, and are further classified as either
persistent or transient magnetars. Their X-ray emission is modulated with the
rotational period of the NS, with a typical relative amplitude (so-called
pulsed fraction) between 10-58 per cent, implying that the surface temperature
is significantly non-uniform despite the high thermal conductivity of the
star's crust. Here, we present the first 3D magneto-thermal MHD simulations of
magnetars with strong toroidal magnetic fields. We show that these models,
combined with ray propagation in curved space-time, accurately describe the
light-curves of most transient magnetars in quiescence and allow us to further
constrain their rotational orientation. We find that the presence of a strong
toroidal magnetic field explains the observed asymmetry in the surface
temperature, and is the main cause of the strong modulation of thermal X-ray

characteristic of a narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxy. The transient events
are long-lived, over 400 days on average. We report UV and X-ray follow-up of
the flares and observe persistent UV-bright emission, with two of the five
transients detected with luminous X-ray emission, ruling out a supernova

flaring NLSy1 galaxies, and find that they fall into three spectroscopic
categories: Transients with 1) Balmer line profiles and Fe II complexes typical
of NLSy1s, 2) strong He II profiles, and 3) He II profiles including Bowen
fluorescence features. The latter are members of the growing class of AGN
flares attributed to enhanced accretion reported by Trakhtenbrot et al. (2019).

rebrightening in the optical, ruling out a simple tidal disruption event
scenario for those transients. We conclude that three of the sample belong to

Tests of GR will become possible with longer interferometric baselines (likely
requiring a space mission) that reach the resolution where
astrophysics-independent predictions of the theory become observable.

density retarded two point function at a special point in the complex
$(\omega,p)$ planes. We propose that pole skipping is determined by the stress
tensor contribution to many-body chaos, and the special point is at
$(\omega,p)_\text{p.s.}= i \lambda^{(T)}(1,1/u_B^{(T)})$, where
$\lambda^{(T)}=2\pi/\beta$ and $u_B^{(T)}$ are the stress tensor contributions
to the Lyapunov exponent and the butterfly velocity respectively. While this
proposal is consistent with previous studies conducted for maximally chaotic
theories, where the stress tensor dominates chaos, it clarifies that one cannot
use pole skipping to extract the Lyapunov exponent of a theory, which obeys
$\lambda\leq \lambda^{(T)}$. On the other hand, in a large class of strongly
coupled but non-maximally chaotic theories $u_B^{(T)}$ is the true butterfly
velocity and we conjecture that $u_B\leq u_B^{(T)}$ is a universal bound. While
it remains a challenge to explain pole skipping in a general framework, we
provide a stringent test of our proposal in the large-$q$ limit of the SYK
chain, where we determine $\lambda,\, u_B,$ and the energy density two point
function in closed form for all values of the coupling, interpolating between
the free and maximally chaotic limits. Since such an explicit expression for a
thermal correlator is one of a kind, we take the opportunity to analyze many of
its properties: the coupling dependence of the diffusion constant, the
dispersion relations of poles, and the convergence properties of all order
hydrodynamics.

internal structure of a simulated Milky Way (MW)-size halo. Self-interacting
dark matter (SIDM) is an alternative to collisionless cold dark matter (CDM)
which offers a unique solution to the problems encountered with CDM on
sub-galactic scales. Although previous SIDM simulations have mainly considered
elastic collisions, theoretical considerations motivate the existence of
multi-state dark matter where transitions from the excited to the ground state
are exothermic. In this work, we consider a self-interacting, two-state dark
matter model with inelastic collisions, implemented in the Arepo code. We find
that energy injection from inelastic self-interactions reduces the central
density of the MW halo in a shorter timescale relative to the elastic scale,
resulting in a larger core size. Inelastic collisions also isotropize the
orbits, resulting in an overall lower velocity anisotropy for the inelastic MW
halo. In the inner halo, the inelastic SIDM case (minor-to-major axis ratio $s
\equiv c/a \approx 0.65$) is more spherical than the CDM ($s \approx 0.4$), but
less spherical than the elastic SIDM case ($s \approx 0.75$). The speed
distribution $f(v)$ of dark matter particles at the location of the Sun in the
inelastic SIDM model shows a significant departure from the CDM model, with
$f(v)$ falling more steeply at high speeds. In addition, the velocity kicks
imparted during inelastic collisions produce unbound high-speed particles with
velocities up to 500 km s$^{-1}$ throughout the halo. This implies that
inelastic SIDM can potentially leave distinct signatures in direct detection
experiments, relative to elastic SIDM and CDM.

reported. Although other explanations are plausible, the possibility that it
arises from dark matter (DM) is valid. In this work we interpret the excess in
the framework of DM annihilation, using as our representative case WIMP DM
annihilating to bottom quarks, and we perform a detailed study of the
systematic uncertainty in the $J$-factor for the M31 field. We find that the
signal favors a DM particle with a mass of $\sim$46-73 GeV. While the mass is
well constrained, the systematic uncertainty in the cross-section spans 2.5
orders of magnitude, ranging from $\sim$8$\times 10^{-27}-4 \times 10^{-24} \
\mathrm{cm^3 \ s^{-1}}$. This high uncertainty is due to two main factors,
namely, an uncertainty in the substructure nature and geometry of the DM halos
for both M31 and the Milky Way (MW), and correspondingly, an uncertainty in the
contribution to the signal from the MW's DM halo along the line of sight.
However, under the conditions that the minimum subhalo mass is $\lesssim
10^{-6} \ M_\odot$ and the actual contribution from the MW's DM halo along the

is a large overlap with the DM interpretations of both the Galactic center (GC)
excess and the antiproton excess, while also being compatible with the limits
for the MW dwarf spheroidals. More generally, we summarize the results from
numerous complementary DM searches in the energy range 10 GeV $-$ 300 GeV

still remains viable for discovery of the DM particle.

shown useful for the Tully-Fisher (luminosity-rotation velocity) relation. We

dominated by the intrinsic scatter of $0.5\,$dex. A tight correlation is also

most one value of $z$ that can be the accumulation point of such a staircase.
In this manuscript, we identify three sequences of open, disjoint, blocked

M31's satellites lie within about 1 sigma of the simulation median for every

satellite planarity for isolated hosts versus hosts in LG-like pairs. Baryonic

Associations Containing Young stars) sample taking in consideration all
possible biases in our identification of binary candidates, such as activity
and rotation. Using high-resolution spectroscopic observations we have produced
$\sim$1300 cross-correlation functions (CCFs) to disentangle the previously
mentioned sources of contamination. The radial velocity values obtained were
cross-matched with the literature and were used to revise and update the
spectroscopic binary (SB) fraction in each of the SACY association. In order to
better describe the CCF profile, we calculated a set of high-order
cross-correlation features to determine the origin of the variations in radial
velocities. We identified 68 SB candidates from our sample of 410 objects. Our
results hint that the youngest associations have a higher SB fraction.
Specifically, we found sensitivity-corrected SB fractions of $22 \substack{+15
\\ -11} \%$ for $\epsilon$~Cha , $31 \substack{+16 \\ -14} \%$ for TW Hya and
$32 \substack{+9 \\ -8} \%$ for $\beta$~Pictoris, in contrast with the five
oldest ($\sim 35-125$ Myr) associations we have sampled which are $\sim 10\%$
or lower. This result seems independent of the methodology used to asses
membership to the associations. The new CCF analysis, radial velocity estimates
and SB candidates are particularly relevant for membership revision of targets
in young stellar associations. These targets would be ideal candidates for
follow-up campaigns using high-resolution techniques in order to confirm
binarity, resolve the orbits, and ideally calculate dynamical masses.
Additionally, if the results on SB fraction in the youngest associations are
confirmed, it could hint of non-universal multiplicity among SACY associations.

  We breach this gap in two steps: (1) We present a space efficient reduction
to the Orthogonal Vectors Problem (OV), one of the most central problem in
Fine-Grained Complexity. The reduction is established via an intricate
combination of the method of Schroeppel and Shamir, and the representation
technique introduced by Howgrave-Graham and Joux (EUROCRYPT 2010) for designing
Subset Sum algorithms for the average case regime. (2) We provide an algorithm
for OV that detects an orthogonal pair among $N$ given vectors in $\{0,1\}^d$

algorithm for OV is based on and refines the representative families framework
developed by Fomin, Lokshtanov, Panolan and Saurabh (J. ACM 2016).
  Our reduction uncovers a curious tight relation between Subset Sum and OV,

the runtime of Schroeppel and Shamir, which is also a long standing open

direct numerical simulation (DNS) of the incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations. The two-dimensional bump causes a series of strong pressure
gradients alternating in rapid succession. At the inflow, the momentum
thickness Reynolds number is approximately 1,000 and the boundary layer
thickness is 1/8 of the bump height. DNS results show that the strong favorable
pressure gradient (FPG) causes the boundary layer to enter a relaminarization
process. The near-wall turbulence is significantly weakened and becomes
intermittent, however relaminarization does not complete. The streamwise
velocity profiles deviate above the standard logarithmic law and the Reynolds
shear stress is reduced. The strong acceleration also suppresses the wall-shear
normalized turbulent kinetic energy production rate. At the bump peak, where
the FPG switches to an adverse gradient (APG), the near-wall turbulence is
suddenly enhanced through a partial retransition process. This results in a new
highly energized internal layer which is more resilient to the strong APG and
only produces incipient flow separation on the downstream side. In the strong
FPG and APG regions, the inner and outer layers become largely independent of
each other. The near-wall region responds to the pressure gradients and
determines the skin friction. The outer layer behaves similarly to a free-shear
layer subject to pressure gradients and mean streamline curvature effects.
Results from a RANS simulation of the bump are also discussed and clearly show
the lack of predictive capacity of the near-wall pressure gradient effects on
the mean flow.

games by omitting the values of some of the coalitions. This allows to
incorporate uncertainty into the model and study the underlying games as well

paper we perform a systematic study of incomplete games, focusing on two
important classes of cooperative games: positive and convex games.
  Regarding positivity, we generalise previous results for a special class of
minimal incomplete games to general setting. We characterise non-extendability
to a positive game by the existence of a certificate and provide a description
of the set of positive extensions using its extreme games. The results are then
used to obtain explicit formulas for several classes of incomplete games with
special structures.
  The second part deals with convexity. We begin with considering the case of
non-negative minimal incomplete games. Then we survey existing results in the
related theory of set functions, namely providing context to the problem of
completing partial functions. We provide a characterisation of extendability
and a full description of the set of symmetric convex extensions. The set
serves as an approximation of the set of convex extensions.
  Finally, we outline an entirely new perspective on a connection between
incomplete cooperative games and cooperative interval games.

Performance of the proposed lung segmentation algorithm was extensively
evaluated on CT scans of subjects with COPD, confirmed COVID-19, lung cancer,
and IPF, despite no labeled training data of the latter three diseases. Lobar
segmentations were obtained using the left and right lung segmentation as input
to the LobeNet algorithm. Regional lobar analysis was performed using
hierarchical clustering to identify radiographic subtypes of COVID-19. The
proposed lung segmentation algorithm was quantitatively evaluated using
semi-automated and manually-corrected segmentations in 87 COVID-19 CT images,
achieving an average symmetric surface distance of $0.495 \pm 0.309$ mm and
Dice coefficient of $0.985 \pm 0.011$. Hierarchical clustering identified four
radiographical phenotypes of COVID-19 based on lobar fractions of consolidated

more afflicted with poor aeration and consolidation. However, the most severe
cases demonstrated involvement of all lobes. The polymorphic training approach
was able to accurately segment COVID-19 cases with diffuse consolidation

painting of public surfaces may carry rich information about the time and
region it was made. Existing studies have explored the spatial distribution of
graffiti, but most of them considered graffiti as a whole, with no separation
among the types. Also, the analyses rarely take into account the city topology.
In this work, we propose to categorize the graffiti into three types: simple
scribbles, complex scribbles, canvases. We analyze the spatial distribution and
identify the spatial bias of each type. To further analyze the spatial
distribution of the types, we apply concepts from complex networks. First,
regions (communities) defined by the connectivity profiles of the city network
are obtained and the prevalence of each type of graffiti over these regions are
analyzed. Next, a measure based on the dynamics of the network (accessibility)
is calculated and compared to the distribution of the graffiti types. A case
study is performed in the analysis of three different categories of graffiti in
the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. The results showed that the categories present
characteristic spatial distributions. The ratio of each type per community of
the network, though, does not pose significant deviations. Finally, a small
positive correlation was observed between the locations of each graffiti type
and the accessibility.

CBC searches, reducing contamination by terrestrial and instrumental
transients, which create a loud noise background by triggering numerous false

sheer volume of data and a large number of expected detections also prompts the
use of ML techniques. We perform transfer learning to train ""InceptionV3"", a
pre-trained deep neural network, along with curriculum learning to distinguish
GW signals from noisy events by analysing their continuous wavelet transform
(CWT) maps. MLStat incorporates information from this ML classifier into the
coincident search likelihood used by the standard PyCBC search. This leads to
at least an order of magnitude improvement in the inverse false-alarm-rate

substantial improvement to the detection sensitivity of Advanced LIGO for all
compact binary coalescences. The average improvement in the sensitive volume is
~10% for low chirp masses (0.8-5 Msun), and ~30% for higher masses (5-50 Msun).
This work demonstrates the immense potential and readiness of MLStat for
finding new sources in current data and the possibility of its adaptation in
similar searches.

increasing with galaxy intrinsic flattening. However, a physical explanation
for this empirical trend was missing. Here we construct Jeans Anisotropic
Models (JAM), with either cylindrically or spherically aligned velocity
ellipsoid (two extreme assumptions), and each with either spatially-constant or
-variable anisotropy. We use JAM to build mock samples of axisymmetric
galaxies, assuming on average an oblate shape for the velocity ellipsoid (as
required to reproduce the rotation of real galaxies), and limiting the radial
anisotropy $\beta$ to the range allowed by physical solutions. We find that all
four mock samples naturally predict the observed galaxy distribution on the

where the candidate states correspond to a quantum system with many qubit
subsystems, implementing the optimal measurement on the entire system is
experimentally infeasible.
  We use RLNN to find locally-adaptive measurement strategies that are
experimentally feasible, where only one quantum subsystem is measured in each
round. We provide numerical results which demonstrate that RLNN successfully
finds the optimal local approach, even for candidate states up to 20

the success probability for a modified locally greedy approach in each random
trial.
  While the use of RLNN is highly successful for designing adaptive local
measurement strategies, in general a significant gap can exist between the
success probability of the optimal locally-adaptive measurement strategy and
the optimal collective measurement. We build on previous work to provide a set
of necessary and sufficient conditions for collective protocols to strictly
outperform locally adaptive protocols. We also provide a new example which, to
our knowledge, is the simplest known state set exhibiting a significant gap

(e.g. document, video and images) due to their ability to learn complex feature
interactions and representations. However, they do not model characteristics
such as diversity, representation, and coverage, which are also very important
for summarization tasks. On the other hand, submodular functions naturally
model these characteristics because of their diminishing returns property. Most
approaches for modelling and learning submodular functions rely on very simple
models, such as weighted mixtures of submodular functions. Unfortunately, these
models only learn the relative importance of the different submodular functions
(such as diversity, representation or importance), but cannot learn more
complex feature representations, which are often required for state-of-the-art
performance. We propose Deep Submodular Networks (DSN), an end-to-end learning
framework that facilitates the learning of more complex features and richer
functions, crafted for better modelling of all aspects of summarization. The
DSN framework can be used to learn features appropriate for summarization from
scratch. We demonstrate the utility of DSNs on both generic and query focused
image-collection summarization, and show significant improvement over the
state-of-the-art. In particular, we show that DSNs outperform simple mixture
models using off the shelf features. Secondly, we also show that just using
four submodular functions in a DSN with end-to-end learning performs comparably
to the state-of-the-art mixture model with a hand-crafted set of 594 components

which the usual suspects of prior module calculi (kinds, constructors, dynamic

encapsulates computational effects. Our main result is a (significant)
proof-relevant and phase-sensitive generalization of the Reynolds abstraction
theorem for a calculus of program modules, based on a new kind of logical
relation called a parametricity structure. Parametricity structures generalize
the proof-irrelevant relations of classical parametricity to proof-relevant
families, where there may be non-trivial evidence witnessing the relatedness of
two programs -- simplifying the metatheory of strong sums over the collection
of types, for although there can be no ""relation classifying relations"", one
easily accommodates a ""family classifying small families"". Using the insight
that logical relations/parametricity is itself a form of phase distinction
between the syntactic and the semantic, we contribute a new synthetic approach

types"", iterating our modal account of the phase distinction. Then, to
construct a simulation between two implementations of an abstract type, one
simply programs a third implementation whose type component carries the

successfully generalize to more complex unseen layouts that exhibit composition

such, the class of possible causal DAGs is represented by a maximally oriented
partially directed acyclic graph (MPDAG), which contains both directed and
undirected edges. We characterize the minimal additional edge orientations
required to identify a given total effect. A recursive algorithm is then
developed to enumerate subclasses of DAGs, such that the total effect in each

platforms, utilizes existing real-world social relationships for promotions and
sales of products. It has been growing rapidly in recent years and attracted
tens of millions of users in China. A key group of actors who enable market
transactions on these platforms are intermediaries who connect producers with
consumers by sharing information with and recommending products to their
real-world social contacts. Despite their crucial role, the nature and behavior
of these intermediaries on these social e-commerce platforms has not been
systematically analyzed. Here we address this knowledge gap through a mixed
method study. Leveraging 9 months' all-round behavior of about 40 million users
on Beidian -- one of the largest social e-commerce sites in China, alongside
with qualitative evidence from online forums and interviews, we examine
characteristics of intermediaries, identify their behavioral patterns and
uncover strategies and mechanisms that make successful intermediaries. We
demonstrate that intermediaries on social e-commerce sites act as local trend
detectors and ""social grocers"". Furthermore, successful intermediaries are
highly dedicated whenever best sellers appear and broaden items for promotion.
To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first large-scale
analysis on the emerging role of intermediaries in social e-commerce platforms,
which provides potential insights for the design and management of social
computing marketing platforms.

closed-loop dynamics thereby making the control design computationally
expensive. The computation time becomes even higher when a learning strategy
such as reinforcement learning (RL) needs to be applied to deal with the
situation when the agents dynamics are not known. To resolve this problem, we
propose a parallel RL scheme for a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) design in a
continuous-time linear MAS. The idea is to exploit the structural properties of
two graphs embedded in the $Q$ and $R$ weighting matrices in the LQR objective
to define an orthogonal transformation that can convert the original LQR design
to multiple decoupled smaller-sized LQR designs. We show that if the MAS is
homogeneous then this decomposition retains closed-loop optimality. Conditions
for decomposability, an algorithm for constructing the transformation matrix, a

value in data mining applications. However, trajectory data is enormous in
volume, so it is expensive to store and process the raw data directly.
Trajectories are also redundant so data compression techniques can be applied.
In this paper, we propose effective algorithms to simplify trajectories. We
first extend existing algorithms by replacing the commonly used $L_2$ metric
with the $L_\infty$ metric so that they can be generalized to high dimensional
space (e.g., 3-space in practice). Next, we propose a novel approach, namely
L-infinity Multidimensional Interpolation Trajectory Simplification (LiMITS).
LiMITS belongs to weak simplification and takes advantage of the $L_\infty$
metric. It generates simplified trajectories by multidimensional interpolation.
It also allows a new format called compact representation to further improve
the compression ratio. Finally, We demonstrate the performance of LiMITS
through experiments on real-world datasets, which show that it is more
effective than other existing methods.

are the rows of a $d$-dimensional Hadamard matrix and the target is one of the
features, i.e. very sparse. We essentially prove this conjecture: We show that
after receiving a random training set of size $k < d$, the expected square loss
is still $1-\frac{k}{(d-1)}$. The only requirement needed is that the input
layer is fully connected and the initial weight vectors of the input nodes are
chosen from a rotation invariant distribution.
  Surprisingly the same type of problem can be solved drastically more
efficient by a simple 2-layer linear neural network in which the $d$ inputs are
connected to the output node by chains of length 2 (Now the input layer has
only one edge per input). When such a network is trained by gradient descent,
then it has been shown that its expected square loss is $\frac{\log d}{k}$.

sample efficiently learn sparse targets with gradient descent when the number

sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone are risk factors for asthma
exacerbation (hospital admission and emergency room visits for asthma attack).
The number of statistical tests and models were counted in 17 randomly selected
base papers from 87 used in the meta-analysis. P-value plots for each air
component were constructed to evaluate the effect heterogeneity of p-values
used from all 87 base papers The number of statistical tests possible in the 17
selected base papers was large, median=15,360 (interquartile range=1,536 to
40,960), in comparison to results presented. Each p-value plot showed a
two-component mixture with small p-values less than .001 while other p-values
appeared random (p-values greater than .05). Given potentially large numbers of
statistical tests conducted in the 17 selected base papers, p-hacking cannot be
ruled out as explanations for small p-values. Our interpretation of the
meta-analysis is that the random p-values indicating null associations are more
plausible and that the meta-analysis will not likely replicate in the absence
of bias. We conclude the meta-analysis and base papers used are unreliable and
do not offer evidence of value to inform public health practitioners about air
quality as a risk factor for asthma exacerbation. The following areas are
crucial for enabling improvements in risk factor chronic disease observational

exponentially large, suggesting that highly squeezed states are ""primed"" for
quantum chaos. A quantum generalization of the classical symplectic phase space
matrix can be used to extract the quantum Lyapunov spectrum, and we find this
better captures the exponential growth of squeezed states for all squeezing
angles compared to any single OTOC. By describing cosmological perturbations in
the squeezed state language, we are able to apply our calculations of the OTOC
to arbitrary expanding and contracting backgrounds with fixed equation of

exponentially growing OTOC at late times, with a putative Lyapunov exponent
consistent with other calculations. While the late-time behavior of the OTOC

such as ID3, C4.5, and CART. Our algorithm achieves provable guarantees for all
target functions $f: \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}$ with respect to the uniform
distribution, circumventing impossibility results showing that existing
heuristics fare poorly even for simple target functions. The crux of our
extension is a new splitting criterion that takes into account the correlations
between $f$ and small subsets of its attributes. The splitting criteria of
existing heuristics (e.g. Gini impurity and information gain), in contrast, are
based solely on the correlations between $f$ and its individual attributes.
  Our algorithm satisfies the following guarantee: for all target functions $f
: \{-1,1\}^n \to \{-1,1\}$, sizes $s\in \mathbb{N}$, and error parameters
$\epsilon$, it constructs a decision tree of size $s^{\tilde{O}((\log
s)^2/\epsilon^2)}$ that achieves error $\le O(\mathsf{opt}_s) + \epsilon$,
where $\mathsf{opt}_s$ denotes the error of the optimal size $s$ decision tree.
A key technical notion that drives our analysis is the noise stability of $f$,
a well-studied smoothness measure.

modern quantum optics and condensed matter physics. Polaritons emerge as a
result of strong interaction between an optical mode and a material resonance,
which is frequently realized in molecular, van der Waals, or solid-state
platforms (1-7). However, this route requires accurate (nano)fabrication and
often lacks simple means for tunability, which could be disadvantageous in some
applications. Here, we use a different approach to realize polaritonic states
by employing a stable equilibrium between two parallel gold nanoflakes in an
aqueous solution (8). Such plates form a self-assembled Fabry-Perot microcavity
with the fundamental optical mode in the visible spectral range. The
equilibrium distance between the plates is determined by a balance between
attractive Casimir and repulsive electrostatic forces (9-11) and can be
controlled by concentration of ligand molecules in the solution, temperature,
and light pressure, which allows active and facile tuning of the cavity
resonance by external stimuli. Using this Casimir approach, we demonstrate
self-assembled polaritons by placing an excitonic medium in the microcavity
region, as well as observe their laser-induced modulations in and out of the
strong coupling regime. These Casimir microcavities can be used as sensitive
and tunable polaritonic platforms for a variety of applications, including
opto-mechanics (12), nanomachinery (13), and cavity-induced effects, like
polaritonic chemistry (14).

and an extremely faint orthogonal bipolar outflow, contrary to the pinched
waist PN morphology suggested by its optical image. Our kinematic analysis
indicates that the torus is expanding at 25$\pm$5 km s$^{-1}$ and is gradually
breaking up. At an estimated distance of 7.1$_{-0.3}^{+0.8}$ kpc, the
corresponding kinematic age of $\sim$26000 years is consistent with a faint and
disintegrating PN. The intermediate-resolution spectra reveal an excited PN
with chemical abundances typical of Type II PNe. Based on the latter we also
estimate an initial mass for the progenitor in the range 2--3 M$_{\odot}$ and a
central star (CSPN) mass $M_\mathrm{CSPN}\sim$0.61 M$_{\odot}$. The Spitzer
MIPS 24 $\mu$m emission that closely follows the fragmented torus could be

sequence of very highly undersampled images. In order to be able to perform MRF
reconstruction, state-of-the-art MRF methods rely on priors such as the MR

spatial regularization. However to our knowledge these three regularizations

indeed challenging to incorporate effectively multiple regularizations in a

robust to noise especially when the sequence length is short. In this paper, we
propose a family of new methods where spatial and low-rank regularizations, in

most notably Ramanujan, and are related to many areas of mathematics including
combinatorics, modular forms, representation theory, analysis, and mathematical
physics. Here, we focus on partitions with gap conditions and partitions with
parts coming from fixed residue classes.
  Let $\Delta_d^{(a,b)}(n) = q_d^{(a)}(n) - Q_d^{(b)}(n)$ where $q_d^{(a)}(n)$
counts the number of partitions of $n$ into parts with difference at least $d$
and size at least $a$, and $Q_d^{(b)}(n)$ counts the number of partitions into
parts $\equiv \pm b \pmod{d + 3}$. In 1956, Alder conjectured that
$\Delta_d^{(1,1)}(n) \geq 0$ for all positive $n$ and $d$. This conjecture was
proved partially by Andrews in 1971, by Yee in 2008, and was fully resolved by
Alfes, Jameson and Lemke Oliver in 2011. Alder's conjecture generalizes several
well-known partition identities, including Euler's theorem that the number of
partitions of $n$ into odd parts equals the number of partitions of $n$ into
distinct parts, as well as the first of the famous Rogers-Ramanujan identities.
  In 2020, Kang and Park constructed an extension of Alder's conjecture which
relates to the second Rogers-Ramanujan identity by considering
$\Delta_d^{(a,b,-)}(n) = q_d^{(a)}(n) - Q_d^{(b,-)}(n)$ where $Q_d^{(b,-)}(n)$
counts the number of partitions into parts $\equiv \pm b \pmod{d + 3}$
excluding the $d+3-b$ part. Kang and Park conjectured that
$\Delta_d^{(2,2,-)}(n)\geq 0$ for all $d\geq 1$ and $n\geq 0$, and proved this
for $d = 2^r - 2$ and $n$ even.
  We prove Kang and Park's conjecture for all but finitely many $d$. Toward
proving the remaining cases, we adapt work of Alfes, Jameson and Lemke Oliver
to generate asymptotics for the related functions. Finally, we present a more
generalized conjecture for higher $a=b$ and prove it for infinite classes of
$n$ and $d$.

that the appearance of foreground (positive) regions can be similar to
background (negative) regions. As a result, many automatic segmentation
algorithms tend to exhibit asymmetric errors, typically producing more false
positives than false negatives. In this paper, we aim to leverage this
asymmetry and train a diverse ensemble of models with very high recall, while
sacrificing their precision. Our core idea is straightforward: A diverse
ensemble of low precision and high recall models are likely to make different
false positive errors (classifying background as foreground in different parts
of the image), but the true positives will tend to be consistent. Thus, in
aggregate the false positive errors will cancel out, yielding high performance
for the ensemble. Our strategy is general and can be applied with any
segmentation model. In three different applications (carotid artery
segmentation in a neck CT angiography, myocardium segmentation in a

tuning parameters that are challenging to configure for optimal link
performance. Recently, reinforcement learning has been proposed to automate
link adaptation, where the transmission parameters are modeled as discrete arms
of a multi-armed bandit. In this context, we propose a latent learning model
for link adaptation that exploits the correlation between data transmission
parameters. Further, motivated by the recent success of Thompson sampling for
multi-armed bandit problems, we propose a latent Thompson sampling (LTS)
algorithm that quickly learns the optimal parameters for a given channel state.
We extend LTS to fading wireless channels through a tuning-free mechanism that
automatically tracks the channel dynamics. In numerical evaluations with fading

upon unsupervised cross-lingual representation learning frameworks, we develop
several deep Transformer based RE models with a novel encoding scheme that can
effectively encode both entity location and entity type information. Our RE

zero-shot cross-lingual RE, achieving the state-of-the-art cross-lingual RE

obtained the first spectroscopic detection of CH$_3$C$_3$N
(methylcyanoacetylene or cyanopropyne) in Titan's atmosphere through the
observation of seven transitions in the $J = 64\rightarrow63$ and $J =

suggested by the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer detection of its
protonated form: C$_4$H$_3$NH$^+$, but the atmospheric abundance of the
associated (deprotonated) neutral product is not well constrained due to the
lack of appropriate laboratory reaction data. Here, we derive the column
density of CH$_3$C$_3$N to be (3.8-5.7)$\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ based on
radiative transfer models sensitive to altitudes above 400 km Titan's middle

detection of methylcyanoacetylene provides important constraints for the
determination of the associated production pathways (such as those involving
CN, CCN, and hydrocarbons), and reaction rate coefficients. These results also
further demonstrate the importance of ALMA and (sub)millimeter spectroscopy for
future investigations of Titan's organic inventory and atmospheric chemistry,
as CH$_3$C$_3$N marks the heaviest polar molecule detected spectroscopically in

quality of content recommendation systems by employing both wider and deeper
models, but this comes at great infrastructural cost and carbon footprint in
modern data centers. Pruning is an effective technique that reduces both memory

recommendation systems is challenging due to the continuous data distribution
shift (a.k.a non-stationary data). Although incremental training on the full
model is able to adapt to the non-stationary data, directly applying it on the

pruning requires adjustment to learn new patterns. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to provide in-depth analysis and discussion
of applying pruning to online recommendation systems with non-stationary data

present an adaptive dense to sparse paradigm equipped with a novel pruning
algorithm for pruning a large scale recommendation system with non-stationary

the sparsity across layers to avoid repeating hand-tuning, which is critical
for pruning the heterogeneous architectures of recommendation systems trained

near-inertial energy levels are elevated within the vortex core. Some aspects
of this process, including the nonlinear modification of the vortex by the
wave, are explained by the existence of trapped near-inertial eigenmodes. These
vortex eigenmodes are easily excited by an initial wave with horizontal scale
much larger than that of the vortex radius. We study this process using a
wave-averaged model of near-inertial dynamics and compare its theoretical
predictions with numerical solutions of the three-dimensional Boussinesq
equations. In the linear approximation, the model predicts the eigenmode
frequencies and spatial structures, and a near-inertial wave energy signature
that is characterized by an approximately time-periodic, azimuthally invariant
pattern. The wave-averaged model represents the nonlinear feedback of the waves
on the vortex via a wave-induced contribution to the potential vorticity that
is proportional to the Laplacian of the kinetic energy density of the waves.
When this is taken into account, the modal frequency is predicted to increase
linearly with the energy of the initial excitation. Both linear and nonlinear
predictions agree convincingly with the Boussinesq results.

data stored in an episodic memory while expanding the final classifier nodes to
accommodate the new classes.
  In this work, we substitute the expanding classifier with a novel fixed
classifier in which a number of pre-allocated output nodes are subject to the
classification loss right from the beginning of the learning phase. Contrarily
to the standard expanding classifier, this allows: (a) the output nodes of
future unseen classes to firstly see negative samples since the beginning of
learning together with the positive samples that incrementally arrive; (b) to
learn features that do not change their geometric configuration as novel
classes are incorporated in the learning model.
  Experiments with public datasets show that the proposed approach is as
effective as the expanding classifier while exhibiting novel intriguing
properties of the internal feature representation that are otherwise
not-existent. Our ablation study on pre-allocating a large number of classes

localisation neural network makes it lightweight and easy-to-deploy on devices
with stringent constraints on computational resources. We further investigate
for localisation the use of deep learning models and design novel architectures
for convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM). We
extensively evaluate these localisation algorithms for continuous tracking in
indoor environments. Experimental results prove that even an SNN model, after a
careful handcrafted feature extraction, can achieve accurate localisation.
Meanwhile, using a well-organised architecture, the neural network models can
be trained directly with raw data from the CSI and localisation features can be
automatically extracted to achieve accurate position estimates. We also found
that the performance of neural network-based methods are directly affected by
the number of anchor access points (APs) regardless of their structure. With
three APs, all neural network models proposed in this paper can obtain
localisation accuracy of around 0.5 metres. In addition the proposed deep NN
architecture reduces the data pre-processing time by 6.5 hours compared with a
shallow NN using the data collected in our testbed. In the deployment phase,
the inference time is also significantly reduced to 0.1 ms per sample. We also

with higher relative degree change in temporal proximity to an arriving node
get an attachment probability boost. In other words, if PA describes a
rich-get-richer mechanism, and fitness-based approaches describe
good-get-richer mechanisms, then our model can be characterized as a
hot-get-richer mechanism, where hotness is determined by the rate of degree

characterizing them diasteroidal triple free. It has numerous applications in
the field of real world problems like network technology and telecommunication

ordering for the vertices of the augmented adjacency matrix of it. Next we find
that underlying graph of a proper oriented circular-arc catch digraph is a

catch digraphs by defining a certain kind of circular vertex ordering of its

not been tested. To address the exponential complexity of the problem, a
table-top quantum simulator in the form of an engineered Bose-Einstein
condensate (BEC) has been proposed to give dynamical solutions of the quantum
field equations. In this paper, we give a numerical feasibility study of the
BEC quantum simulator under realistic conditions and temperatures, with an
approximate truncated Wigner (tW) phase-space method. We report the observation
of false vacuum tunneling in these simulations, and the formation of multiple
bubble 'universes' with distinct topological properties. The tunneling gives a
transition of the relative phase of coupled Bose fields from a metastable to a
stable 'vacuum'. We include finite temperature effects that would be found in a
laboratory experiment and also analyze the cut-off dependence of modulational
instabilities in Floquet space. Our numerical phase-space model does not use
thin-wall approximations, which are inapplicable to cosmologically interesting
models. It is expected to give the correct quantum treatment including
superpositions and entanglement during dynamics. By analyzing a nonlocal
observable called the topological phase entropy (TPE), our simulations provide
information about phase structure in the true vacuum. We observe a cooperative
effect in which the true vacua bubbles representing distinct universes each
have one or the other of two distinct topologies. The TPE initially increases
with time, reaching a peak as the multiple universes are formed, and then
decreases with time to the phase-ordered vacuum state. This gives a model for
the formation of universes with one of two distinct phases, which is a possible
solution to the problem of particle-antiparticle asymmetry.

  Memory Architecture",,,,,"cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Manycore SoC architectures based on on-chip shared memory are preferred for
flexible and programmable solutions in many application domains. However, the
development of many ported memory is becoming increasingly challenging as we
approach the end of Moore's Law while systems requirements demand larger shared
memory and more access ports. Memory can no longer be designed simply to
minimize single transaction access time, but must take into account the
functionality on the SoC. In this paper we examine a common large memory usage
in SoC, where the memory is used as storage for large buffers that are then
moved for time scheduled processing. We merge two aspects of many ported memory
design, combinatorial analysis of interconnect, and geometric analysis of
critical paths, extending both to show that in this case the SoC performance
benefits significantly from a hierarchical, distributed and staged architecture
with lower-radix switches and fractal randomization of memory bank addressing,
along with judicious and geometry aware application of speed up. The results
presented show the new architecture supports 20% higher throughput with 20%
lower latency and 30% less interconnection area at approximately the same power
consumption. We demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of this
architecture on silicon from a physical design perspective by taking the design
through layout. The architecture enables a much easier implementation flow that
works well with physically irregular port access and memory dominant layout,
which is a common issue in real designs.

obtained continuum observations from NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array

at FIRST spatial resolution, core flux measurements are indeed systematically

smaller angular sizes. We further computed two radio core dominance parameters
R & R5100 for use in statistical orientation investigations with this sample.
We also present the spectral energy distributions between 74 MHz and 1.4 GHz,

successfully learn optimal policies to control real robotic systems. However,

Specifically, in robot applications where failing is undesired but not

prematurely, or (ii) the acquired data being scarce or corrupted. Both
complicate the design of proper reward functions to penalize failures. In this

learning with crash constraints, where no data is obtained upon constraint
violation. The no-data case is addressed by a novel GP model (GPCR) for the
constraint that combines discrete events (failure/success) with continuous
observations (only obtained upon success). We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our framework on simulated benchmarks and on a real jumping quadruped, where
the constraint threshold is unknown a priori. Experimental data is collected,
by means of constrained Bayesian optimization, directly on the real robot. Our
results outperform manual tuning and GPCR proves useful on estimating the

apply CoDA to Transformer-based models on a wide range of natural language

improvement of 2.2% while applied to the RoBERTa-large model. More importantly,
it consistently exhibits stronger results relative to several competitive data

can be flexibly combined with various data augmentation approaches to further
boost their performance, highlighting the wide applicability of the CoDA

adapt to new domains. A scalable paradigm for adaptation necessitates the
development of generalizable models that perform well in few-shot settings. In
this paper, we focus on the intent classification problem which aims to
identify user intents given utterances addressed to the dialog system. We
propose two approaches for improving the generalizability of utterance
classification models: (1) observers and (2) example-driven training. Prior
work has shown that BERT-like models tend to attribute a significant amount of
attention to the [CLS] token, which we hypothesize results in diluted
representations. Observers are tokens that are not attended to, and are an
alternative to the [CLS] token as a semantic representation of utterances.
Example-driven training learns to classify utterances by comparing to examples,
thereby using the underlying encoder as a sentence similarity model. These
methods are complementary; improving the representation through observers
allows the example-driven model to better measure sentence similarities. When
combined, the proposed methods attain state-of-the-art results on three intent
prediction datasets (\textsc{banking77}, \textsc{clinc150}, \textsc{hwu64}) in
both the full data and few-shot (10 examples per intent) settings. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that the proposed approach can transfer to new intents and
across datasets without any additional training.

of a deep neural network, uncompressed training still consumes a huge amount of
hardware resources, run-time and energy. It is highly desirable to directly
train a compact neural network from scratch with low memory and low
computational cost. Low-rank tensor decomposition is one of the most effective
approaches to reduce the memory and computing requirements of large-size neural
networks. However, directly training a low-rank tensorized neural network is a
very challenging task because it is hard to determine a proper tensor rank {\it
a priori}, which controls the model complexity and compression ratio in the
training process. This paper presents a novel end-to-end framework for low-rank
tensorized training of neural networks. We first develop a flexible Bayesian
model that can handle various low-rank tensor formats (e.g., CP, Tucker, tensor
train and tensor-train matrix) that compress neural network parameters in
training. This model can automatically determine the tensor ranks inside a
nonlinear forward model, which is beyond the capability of existing Bayesian
tensor methods. We further develop a scalable stochastic variational inference
solver to estimate the posterior density of large-scale problems in training.
Our work provides the first general-purpose rank-adaptive framework for
end-to-end tensorized training. Our numerical results on various neural network
architectures show orders-of-magnitude parameter reduction and little accuracy
loss (or even better accuracy) in the training process. Specifically, on a very
large deep learning recommendation system with over $4.2\times 10^9$ model

networks, with applications in spam detection, analysis of affiliation networks
etc. It creates a hierarchy of vertex-induced subgraphs with varying densities
determined by the participation of vertices in butterflies (2,2-bicliques). To
build the hierarchy, existing algorithms iteratively follow a
delete-update(peeling) process: deleting vertices with the minimum number of
butterflies and correspondingly updating the butterfly count of their 2-hop
neighbors. The need to explore 2-hop neighborhood renders tip-decomposition
computationally very expensive. Furthermore, the inherent sequentiality in
peeling only minimum butterfly vertices makes derived parallel algorithms prone
to heavy synchronization.
  In this paper, we propose a novel parallel tip-decomposition algorithm --
REfine CoarsE-grained Independent Tasks (RECEIPT) that relaxes the peeling
order restrictions by partitioning the vertices into multiple independent
subsets that can be concurrently peeled. This enables RECEIPT to simultaneously
achieve a high degree of parallelism and dramatic reduction in
synchronizations. Further, RECEIPT employs a hybrid peeling strategy along with
other optimizations that drastically reduce the amount of wedge exploration and
execution time.
  We perform detailed experimental evaluation of RECEIPT on a shared-memory
multicore server. It can process some of the largest publicly available
bipartite datasets orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art
algorithms -- achieving up to 1100x and 64x reduction in the number of thread
synchronizations and traversed wedges, respectively. Using 36 threads, RECEIPT
can provide up to 17.1x self-relative speedup. Our implementation of RECEIPT is

uses a variational algorithm that can learn a quantum sensing circuit based on
platform-specific control capacity, noise, and signal distribution. The quantum
circuit is composed of an encoder which prepares the optimal sensing state and
a decoder which gives an output distribution containing information of the
signal. We optimize the full circuit to maximize the Signal-to-Noise Ratio
(SNR). Furthermore, this learning algorithm can be run on real hardware
scalably by using the ""parameter-shift"" rule which enables gradient evaluation
on noisy quantum circuits, avoiding the exponential cost of quantum system
simulation. We demonstrate up to 13.12x SNR improvement over existing fixed
protocol (GHZ), and 3.19x Classical Fisher Information (CFI) improvement over
the classical limit on 15 qubits using IBM quantum computer. More notably, our
algorithm overcomes the decreasing performance of existing entanglement-based
protocols with increased system sizes.

Absence/presence interactions arise in emerging applications in precision

to identification of network-based biomarkers for diseases. In this paper, we
argue that while the absence/presence hypothesis is important, developing a

Variational Autoencoder (CQ-VAE) employs a discrete latent space with an
internal discrete probability distribution by quantizing the coordinates of a

discrete. During training, Gumbel-Softmax sampling is used to enable
backpropagation through the discrete latent space. A matching algorithm is used
to establish the correspondence between model-generated samples and

new samples and the ability to represent training samples. Besides these
probabilistic components to generate possible outputs, our model has a
deterministic path to output the best estimation. We demonstrated our method on

This perspective makes the case in favor of the larger role that exploratory
and data-driven approach to computational neuroscience could play while
coexisting alongside the traditional hypothesis-driven approach.
  We exemplify the proposed approach in the context of the knowledge
representation taxonomy with three research projects that employ
interpretability techniques on top of machine learning methods at three
different levels of neural organization. The first study (Chapter 3) explores
feature importance analysis of a random forest decoder trained on intracerebral
recordings from 100 human subjects to identify spectrotemporal signatures that
characterize local neural activity during the task of visual categorization.
The second study (Chapter 4) employs representation similarity analysis to
compare the neural responses of the areas along the ventral stream with the
activations of the layers of a deep convolutional neural network. The third
study (Chapter 5) proposes a method that allows test subjects to visually
explore the state representation of their neural signal in real time. This is
achieved by using a topology-preserving dimensionality reduction technique that
allows to transform the neural data from the multidimensional representation
used by the computer into a two-dimensional representation a human can grasp.
  The approach, the taxonomy, and the examples, present a strong case for the
applicability of machine learning methods to automatic knowledge discovery in

Starting from a realistic event-by-event fluctuating hydrodynamical model
calculation, we first show the emergence of ridge + shoulders in the so-called
two-particle long-range correlations, reproducing the data. In contrast to the
commonly used geometric picture of the origin of the anisotropic flow, we can
explain such a structure dynamically in terms of the presence of high
energy-density peripheral tubes in the initial conditions. These tubes
violently explode and deflect the near radial flow coming from the interior of
the hot matter, which in turn produces a two-ridge structure in single-particle
distribution, with approximately two units opening in azimuth. When computing
the two-particle correlation, this will result in characteristic three-ridge
structure, with a high near-side ridge and two symmetric lower away-side ridges
or shoulders. Several anisotropic flows, necessary to producing ridge +
shoulder structure, appear naturally in this dynamical description. Using this
simple idea, we can understand several related phenomena, such as centrality
dependence and trigger-angle dependence.

alignment and has obtained promising results under constrained environments.
However, when a face image suffers from large pose variations, heavy occlusions
and complicated illuminations, the performances of HR methods degrade greatly
due to the low resolutions of the generated landmark heatmaps and the exclusion
of important high-order information that can be used to learn more
discriminative features. To address the alignment problem for faces with
extremely large poses and heavy occlusions, this paper proposes a heatmap
subpixel regression (HSR) method and a multi-order cross geometry-aware (MCG)
model, which are seamlessly integrated into a novel multi-order high-precision
hourglass network (MHHN). The HSR method is proposed to achieve high-precision
landmark detection by a well-designed subpixel detection loss (SDL) and
subpixel detection technology (SDT). At the same time, the MCG model is able to
use the proposed multi-order cross information to learn more discriminative
representations for enhancing facial geometric constraints and context
information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explore
heatmap subpixel regression for robust and high-precision face alignment. The
experimental results from challenging benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the literature.

important area of research over the years because additional modalities, such

viability of training multimodal NMT models without a large parallel corpus
continues to be investigated due to low availability of parallel sentences with

filled with comparable sentences that contain bilingual terms and parallel

test the performance of this comparable sentence translation scenario, we train
several baseline NMT models with our comparable corpus and evaluate their

for our corpus to be used to further research into multimodal NMT with

growing concern in the personal data privacy of their customers. On the other
hand, machine learning (ML) techniques have been widely adopted by digital
service providers to improve operational productivity and customer
satisfaction. ML inevitably accesses and processes users' personal data, which
could potentially breach the relevant privacy protection regulations if not
performed carefully. The situation is exacerbated by the cloud-based
implementation of digital services when user data are captured and stored in
distributed locations, hence aggregation of the user data for ML could be a
serious breach of privacy regulations. In this backdrop, Federated Learning
(FL) is an emerging area that allows ML on distributed data without the data
leaving their stored location. However, depending on the nature of the digital
services, data captured at different locations may carry different significance
to the business operation, hence a weighted aggregation will be highly
desirable for enhancing the quality of the FL-learned model. Furthermore, to
prevent leakage of user data from the aggregated gradients, cryptographic
mechanisms are needed to allow secure aggregation of FL. In this paper, we
propose a privacy-enhanced FL scheme for supporting secure weighted
aggregation. Besides, by devising a verification protocol based on
Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP), the proposed scheme is capable of guarding against
fraudulent messages from FL participants. Experimental results show that our
scheme is practical and secure. Compared to existing FL approaches, our scheme
achieves secure weighted aggregation with an additional security guarantee
against fraudulent messages with an affordable 1.2 times runtime overheads and
1.3 times communication costs.

analyze FG dynamics and sensitivity, focusing on practical schemes for
experimental realization. In the case of a freely floating FG, we model the
transition from dynamics dominated by libration in relatively high externally
applied magnetic fields, to those dominated by precession at relatively low
applied fields. Measurement of the libration frequency enables in situ
measurement of the magnetic field and a technique to reduce the field below the
threshold for which precession dominates the FG dynamics. We note that evidence
of gyroscopic behavior is present even at magnetic fields much larger than the
threshold field below which precession dominates. We also model the dynamics of
an FG levitated above a type-I superconductor via the Meissner effect, and find
that for FGs with dimensions larger than about 100 nm the observed precession
frequency is reduced compared to that of a freely floating FG. This is akin to
negative feedback that arises from the distortion of the field from the FG by
the superconductor. Finally we assess the sensitivity of an FG levitated above
a type-I superconductor to exotic spin-dependent interactions under practical
experimental conditions, demonstrating the potential of FGs for tests of
fundamental physics.

OGLE-2018-BLG-0799. The planetary signal was observed by several ground-based

10^{-3}$. The ground-based observations yield a constraint on the angular
Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$, and the microlensing parallax vector
$\vec{\pi}_{\rm E}$, is strongly constrained by the Spitzer data. However, the
2019 Spitzer baseline data reveal systematics in the Spitzer photometry, so
there is ambiguity in the magnitude of the parallax. In our preferred
interpretation, a full Bayesian analysis using a Galactic model indicates that
the planetary system is composed of an $M_{\rm planet} =
0.26_{-0.11}^{+0.22}~M_{J}$ planet orbiting an $M_{\rm host} =
0.093_{-0.038}^{+0.082}~M_{\odot}$, at a distance of $D_{\rm L} =

localization of the minima along the arc-shaped microlens parallax constraints.
This, in turn, yields a more massive host with median mass of $0.13
{M_{\odot}}$ at a distance of 6.3 kpc. This analysis demonstrates the
robustness of the osculating circles formalism, but shows that further
investigation is needed to assess how systematics affect the specific

Poisson equation solver for the velocity potential with a Neumann-like boundary
condition on the surface of the star. Difficulties that arise in this boundary
value problem are: a) the boundary is not known a-priori, but constitutes part
of the solution of the problem; b) various terms become singular at the
boundary. In this work, we present a new method to solve the fluid Poisson
equation for irrotational/spinning binary neutron stars. The advantage of the
new method is that it does not require complex fluid surface fitted coordinates
and it can be implemented in a Cartesian grid, which is a standard choice in
numerical relativity calculations. This is accomplished by employing the source
term method proposed by Towers, where the boundary condition is treated as a
jump condition and is incorporated as additional source terms in the Poisson
equation, which is then solved iteratively. The issue of singular terms caused
by vanishing density on the surface is resolved with an additional separation
that shifts the computation boundary to the interior of the star. We present
two-dimensional tests to show the convergence of the source term method, and we
further apply this solver to a realistic three-dimensional binary neutron star
problem. By comparing our solution with the one coming from the initial data
solver COCAL, we demonstrate agreement to approximately $1\%$. Our method can
be used in other problems with non-smooth solutions like in magnetized neutron
stars.

challenging, open ended question. While similar equilibrium problems are
tractable using standard thermodynamics, a generalized description for
non-equilibrium systems is lacking, making the design problem particularly
difficult. Here we show we can exploit the large deviation behavior of a
Brownian particle and design a variety of geometrically complex steady-state
density distributions and flux field flows. We achieve this design target from
direct knowledge of the joint large deviation functional for the empirical
density and flow, and a ""relaxation"" algorithm on the desired target states via
adjustable force field parameters. We validate the method by replicating
analytical results, and demonstrate its capacity to yield complex prescribed
targets, such as rose-curve or polygonal shapes on the plane. We consider this
dynamical fluctuation approach a first step towards the design of more complex
NESS where general frameworks are otherwise still lacking.

time as the virtual file system (VFS) traverses the file path components one
after another. The lookup procedure becomes more time consuming when
applications frequently access files, especially those with small sizes. We
propose Stage Lookup, which dynamically caches popular directories to speed up
lookup procedures and further reduce file accessing latency. The core of Stage
Lookup is to cache popular dentries as shortcuts, so that path walks do not
bother to traverse directory trees from the root. Furthermore, Stage Lookup
enriches backward path walks as it treats the directory tree in a VFS as an
undirected map. We implement a Stage Lookup prototype and integrate it into
Linux Kernel v3.14. Our extensive performance evaluation studies show that
Stage Lookup offers up to 46.9% performance gain compared to ordinary path
lookup schemes. Furthermore, Stage Lookup shows smaller performance overheads
in rename and chmod operations compared to the original method of the kernel.

Here, we employ Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering to investigate the spin
excitation spectrum in mesoscopic Fe films, from bulk-like down to 3 unit cells
thick. In bulk-like samples, we find isotropic, dispersive ferromagnons
consistent with the dispersion observed by neutron scattering in bulk single
crystals. As the thickness is reduced, these ferromagnons survive and evolve
anisotropically: renormalising to lower energies along the out-of-plane
direction while retaining their dispersion in the in-plane direction. This
thickness dependence is captured by simple Heisenberg model calculations
accounting for the confinement in the out-of-plane direction through the loss
of Fe bonds. Our findings highlight the effects of mesoscopic scaling on spin
dynamics and identify thickness as a knob for fine-tuning and controlling
magnetic properties in films.

between a human subject and an object. Researchers incorporate global scene
context into the early layers of deep Convolutional Neural Networks as a
solution. They report a significant increase in the performance since generally
interactions are correlated with the scene (\ie riding bicycle on the city
street). However, this approach leads to the following problems. It increases
the network size in the early layers, therefore not efficient. It leads to
noisy filter responses when the scene is irrelevant, therefore not accurate. It
only leverages scene context whereas human-object interactions offer a
multitude of contexts, therefore incomplete. To circumvent these issues, in
this work, we propose Self-Selective Context (SSC). SSC operates on the joint
appearance of human-objects and context to bring the most discriminative
context(s) into play for recognition. We devise novel contextual features that
model the locality of human-object interactions and show that SSC can
seamlessly integrate with the State-of-the-art interaction recognition models.
Our experiments show that SSC leads to an important increase in interaction
recognition performance, while using much fewer parameters.

different images to generate a unique all-in-focus fused image. Deep learning
based methods become the mainstream of image fusion by virtue of its powerful
feature representation ability. However, most of the existing deep learning
structures failed to balance fusion quality and end-to-end implementation
convenience. End-to-end decoder design often leads to unrealistic result
because of its non-linear mapping mechanism. On the other hand, generating an
intermediate decision map achieves better quality for the fused image, but
relies on the rectification with empirical post-processing parameter choices.
In this work, to handle the requirements of both output image quality and
comprehensive simplicity of structure implementation, we propose a cascade
network to simultaneously generate decision map and fused result with an
end-to-end training procedure. It avoids the dependence on empirical
post-processing methods in the inference stage. To improve the fusion quality,
we introduce a gradient aware loss function to preserve gradient information in
output fused image. In addition, we design a decision calibration strategy to
decrease the time consumption in the application of multiple images fusion.
Extensive experiments are conducted to compare with 19 different
state-of-the-art multi-focus image fusion structures with 6 assessment metrics.
The results prove that our designed structure can generally ameliorate the
output fused image quality, while implementation efficiency increases over 30\%
for multiple images fusion.

uniqueness of a weak solution (in the analytic sense) satisfying the energy

energy equality for SCBF equations is not immediate, we construct a sequence

to demonstrate the energy equality. Then, we establish the existence of random
attractors for the stochastic flow generated by the SCBF equations. One of the
technical difficulties connected with the irregular white noise is overcome

transition are characterized by two limiting behaviors where the dynamics are
chaotic and integrable. However, the transition region between them is not
fully understood yet. We propose here a possible finite-size precursor of a
critical point that shows a typical finite-size scaling and distinguishes
between two different dynamical phases. The kurtosis excess of the diagonal
fluctuations of the full one-dimensional momentum distribution from its
microcanonical average is maximum at this singular point in the paradigmatic
disordered $J_1$-$J_2$ model. For system sizes accessible to exact
diagonalization, both the position and the size of this maximum scale linearly
with the system size. Furthermore, we show that this singular point is found at
the same disorder strength at which the Thouless and the Heisenberg energies
coincide. Below this point, the spectral statistics follow the universal random
matrix behavior up to the Thouless energy. Above it, no traces of chaotic
behavior remain, and the spectral statistics are well described by a
generalized semi-Poissonian model, eventually leading to the integrable
Poissonian behavior. We provide, thus, an integrated scenario for the many-body
localization transition, conjecturing that the critical point in the
thermodynamic limit, if it exists, should be given by this value of disorder
strength.

  Artificial Intelligence using continuous-valued logic",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Over the past few years, deep neural networks have shown excellent results in
multiple tasks, however, there is still an increasing need to address the
problem of interpretability to improve model transparency, performance, and
safety. Achieving eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) by combining neural
networks with continuous logic and multi-criteria decision-making tools is one
of the most promising ways to approach this problem: by this combination, the
black-box nature of neural models can be reduced. The continuous logic-based
neural model uses so-called Squashing activation functions, a parametric family
of functions that satisfy natural invariance requirements and contain rectified
linear units as a particular case. This work demonstrates the first benchmark
tests that measure the performance of Squashing functions in neural networks.
Three experiments were carried out to examine their usability and a comparison
with the most popular activation functions was made for five different network
types. The performance was determined by measuring the accuracy, loss, and time
per epoch. These experiments and the conducted benchmarks have proven that the
use of Squashing functions is possible and similar in performance to
conventional activation functions. Moreover, a further experiment was conducted
by implementing nilpotent logical gates to demonstrate how simple
classification tasks can be solved successfully and with high performance. The
results indicate that due to the embedded nilpotent logical operators and the
differentiability of the Squashing function, it is possible to solve
classification problems, where other commonly used activation functions fail.

has been shown in [Cui, Sun, and Toh, {\em Math. Program.}, 178 (2019), pp.
381--415] that if the quadratic growth condition holds at an optimal solution
for the dual problem, then the KKT residual converges to zero R-superlinearly
when the ALM is applied to the primal problem. Moreover, Cui, Ding, and Zhao

for the quadratic growth condition to hold under the metric subregularity and
bounded linear regularity conditions for solving composite matrix optimization

paper, we first provide sufficient conditions to ensure the quadratic growth

Predictively understanding the equilibrium configurations of these systems is
challenging due to intricate couplings between topology, geometry, large
nonlinear deformations, and friction. Here, we perform an in-depth study of a
simple yet canonical problem that captures the essence of contact between
filaments. In the orthogonal clasp, two filaments are brought into contact,
with each centerline lying in one of a pair of orthogonal planes. Our data from
X-ray tomography (micro-CT) and mechanical testing experiments are in excellent
agreement with the finite element method (FEM) simulations. Despite the
apparent simplicity of the physical system, the data exhibits strikingly
unintuitive behavior, even when the contact is frictionless. Specifically, we
observe a curvilinear diamond-shaped ridge in the contact pressure field
between the two filaments, sometimes with an inner gap. When a relative
displacement is imposed between the filaments, friction is activated, and a
highly asymmetric pressure field develops. These findings contrast to the
classic capstan analysis of a single filament wrapped around a rigid body. Both
the micro-CT and the FEM data indicate that the cross-sections of the filaments
can deform significantly. Nonetheless, an idealized geometrical theory assuming
undeformable tube cross-sections and neglecting elasticity rationalizes our
observations qualitatively and highlights the central role of the small but
finite tube radius of the filaments. We believe that our orthogonal clasp
analysis provides a building block for future modeling efforts in frictional
contact mechanics of more complex filamentary structures.

conventional ferromagnetic devices due to their ultrafast dynamics and high
data density. A challenge in designing these devices is the control and
detection of the orientation of the anti-ferromagnet. One of the most promising
ways to achieve this is through the exchange bias effect. This is of particular
importance in large scale multigranular devices. Due to the large system sizes,
previously, only micromagnetic simulations have been possible, these have an
assumed distribution of antiferromagnetic anisotropy directions. Here, we use
an atomistic model where the distribution of antiferromagnetic anisotropy
directions occurs naturally and the exchange bias occurs due to the intrinsic
disorder in the antiferromagnet. We perform large scale simulations, generating
realistic values of exchange bias. We find a strong temperature dependance of
the exchange bias, which approaches zero at the blocking temperature while the
coercivity has a peak at the blocking temeprature due to the superparamagnetic
flipping of the antiferromagnet during the hysteresis loop. We find a large
discrepancy between the exchange bias predicted from a geometric model of the
antiferromagnetic interface indicating the importance of grain edge effects in
multigranular exchange biased systems. The grain size dependence shows the
expected peak due to a competition between the superparamagnetic nature of
small grains and reduction in the statistical imbalance in the number of
interfacial spins for larger grain sizes. Our simulations confirm the existence
of single antiferromagnetic domains within each grain. The model gives insights
into the physical origin of exchange bias and provides a route to developing
optimised nanoscale antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.

efficiency and performance.
  Our approach, iPregel, preserves vertex-centric programmability, while
implementing optimisations for performance, and designing these so they are
transparent to a user's application code, hence not impacting programmability.
In this paper, we evaluate iPregel against FemtoGraph, whose characteristics
are identical, an asynchronous counterpart GraphChi and the
vertex-subset-centric framework Ligra. Our experiments include three of the
most popular vertex-centric benchmark applications over 4 real-world publicly
accessible graphs, which cover orders of magnitude between a million to a
billion edges, measuring execution time and peak memory usage. Finally, we
evaluate the programmability of each framework by comparing against Google's
original Pregel framework.
  Experiments demonstrate that iPregel, like FemtoGraph, does not sacrifice
vertex-centric programmability for additional performance and memory efficiency
optimisations, which contrasts against GraphChi and Ligra. Sacrificing
vertex-centric programmability allowed the latter to benefit from substantial
performance and memory efficiency gains. We demonstrate that iPregel is up to
2300 times faster than FemtoGraph, as well as generating a memory footprint up
to 100 times smaller. Ligra and GraphChi are up to 17000 and 700 times faster
than FemtoGraph but, when comparing against iPregel, this maximum speed-up
drops to 10. Furthermore, with PageRank, iPregel is the fastest overall. For
memory efficiency, iPregel provides the same memory efficiency as Ligra and 3
to 6 times lighter than GraphChi on average.

Imaging in narrow frequency bands has revealed temporal variations in the

III solar radio bursts, and require a better understanding of radio-wave
transport. In this paper, we utilise 3D Monte Carlo ray-tracing simulations
that account for the anisotropic density turbulence in the inhomogeneous solar
corona to quantitatively explain the image dynamics at the fundamental (near
plasma frequency) and harmonic (double) plasma emissions observed at \sim
32~MHz. Comparing the simulations with observations, we find that anisotropic
scattering from an instantaneous emission point source can account for the
observed time profiles, centroid locations, and source sizes of the fundamental
component of type III radio bursts (generated where f_{pe} \approx 32~MHz). The
best agreement with observations is achieved when the ratio of the
perpendicular to the parallel component of the wave vector of anisotropic
density turbulence is around 0.25. Harmonic emission sources observed at the
same frequency (\sim 32~MHz, but generated where f_{pe} \approx 16~MHz) have
apparent sizes comparable to those produced by the fundamental emission, but
demonstrate a much slower temporal evolution. The simulations of radio-wave
propagation make it possible to quantitatively explain the variations of
apparent source sizes and positions at sub-second time-scales both for the
fundamental and harmonic emissions, and can be used as a diagnostic tool for
the plasma turbulence in the upper corona.

the novel concept of velocity-selective nonlinearity to bypass such dynamic

biological tissues, has significant impact in biomedicine yet considered
challenging due to strong scattering nature of light. Previously, promising
progress has been made, benefiting from the iterative optical wavefront
shaping, with which deep-tissue high-resolution optical focusing becomes
possible. Most of iterative algorithms can overcome noise perturbations but
fail to effectively adapt beyond the noise, e.g. sudden strong perturbations.
Re-optimizations are usually needed for significant decorrelated medium since
these algorithms heavily rely on the optimization in the previous iterations.
Such ineffectiveness is probably due to the absence of a metric that can gauge
the deviation of the instant wavefront from the optimum compensation based on
the concurrently measured optical focusing. In this study, a square rule of
binary-amplitude modulation, directly relating the measured focusing
performance with the error in the optimized wavefront, is theoretically proved
and experimentally validated. With this simple rule, it is feasible to quantify
how many pixels on the spatial light modulator incorrectly modulate the
wavefront for the instant status of the medium or the whole system. As an
example of application, we propose a novel algorithm, dynamic mutation
algorithm, with high adaptability against perturbations by probing how far the
optimization has gone toward the theoretically optimum. The diminished focus of
scattered light can be effectively recovered when perturbations to the medium
cause significant drop of the focusing performance, which no existing
algorithms can achieve due to their inherent strong dependence on previous
optimizations. With further improvement, this study may boost or inspire many
applications, like high-resolution imaging and stimulation, in instable
scattering environments.

varying degrees of success when compared to the results of cosmological
$N$-body simulations. We build on this previous work and propose a new model
for $\tau_{\rm merge}$ that draws on insights derived from these simulations.
We find that published predictions can provide reasonable estimates for
$\tau_{\rm merge}$ based on orbital properties at infall, but tend to
underpredict $\tau_{\rm merge}$ inside the host virial radius ($R_{200}$)
because tidal stripping is neglected, and overpredict it outside $R_{200}$
because the host mass is underestimated. Furthermore, we find that models that
account for orbital angular momentum via the circular radius $R_{\rm circ}$
underpredict (overpredict) $\tau_{\rm merge}$ for bound (unbound) systems. By
fitting for the dependence of $\tau_{\rm merge}$ on various orbital and host
halo properties,we derive an improved model for $\tau_{\rm merge}$ that can be
applied to a merging halo at any point in its orbit. Finally, we discuss

linear output regulation, it was proved that embedding an internal model of the
exogenous signals is necessary and sufficient to achieve tracking of the
desired reference signals in spite of external disturbances and parametric
uncertainties. This result is commonly known as ""internal model principle"". A
complete extension of such linear result to general nonlinear systems is still
an open problem, which is exacerbated by the large number of alternative
definitions of uncertainty and desired control goals that are possible in a
nonlinear setting. In this paper, we develop a general framework in which all
these different notions can be formally characterized in a unifying way.
Classical results are reinterpreted in the proposed setting, and new results
and insights are presented with a focus on robust rejection/tracking of
arbitrary harmonic content. Moreover, we show by counter-example that, in the
relevant case of continuous unstructured uncertainties, there are problems for
which no smooth finite-dimensional robust regulator exists ensuring exact
regulation.

the monomer precursors -- an association that is frequently exploited in
materials science. We use molecular simulations to generate spatial networks
from chemically different monomers with identical functionality and show that
such networks have several universal graph-theoretical properties as well as
near universal Young's modulus. The vitrification temperature is shown to be
universal only up to a certain density of the network, as measured by the bond
conversion. The latter observation is explained by the fact that monomer's
tendency to coil enhances formation of topological holes, which, when
accumulated in the network, amount to a percolating cell complex restricting
network's mobility. This higher-order percolation occurs late after gelation
and is shown to coincide with the onset of brittleness, as indicated by a
sudden increase in the glass transition temperature. This phenomenon may
signify a new type of phase transition in polymer materials.

analysis of solid shells subject to large strains and large displacements. The
element is based on hierarchical, heterogeneous, and anisotropic shape
functions. As with other solid shell formulations, only displacement degrees of
freedom are required to describe the shell kinematics and general
three-dimensional material laws can be adopted. However, the novelty of this
formulation is the ability to capture complex shell behaviour and avoid locking
phenomena, without the need to use reduced integration or adopt additional
natural strain or enhanced strain fields. Thus, this element is ideally suited
for geometrically and physically nonlinear problems. This is achieved by
constructing independent approximation shape functions on both the prism
element's triangular faces and through the thickness, where the latter is
associated with a local coordinate system that convects with deformation of the
shell. The element is extremely efficient, with the hierarchical property
lending itself to an efficient and highly scalable multigrid solver, and the
heterogeneity property enables local p-adaptivity. The paper demonstrates
performance of the element for a number of linear and geometrically nonlinear
problems, benchmarked against well established problems in the literature. The
formulation has been implemented in the MoFEM.

confined inside solid tumors under natural situations. Aided by an agent-based

self-renewal probability $p_s$, i.e. the chance that an CSC become

and CSCs are mostly destined to produce differentiated cells at a very low

of the cancer cell colony, becoming quiescent due to the lack of space to
proliferate, which stabilizes their population size. This result provides a
simple explanation for the CSC niche size that dispenses with the need of

  Solid-State Electrolytes: Safeguarding Remarkable Ionic Conductivity and

promising solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) for high-performance all-solid-state
batteries (ASSBs), owing to their high ionic conductivity, adequate plasticity,
and decent mechanical strength. However, their poor incompatibility with Li
metal anode and high voltage cathodes and as well as serious sensitivity to air
significantly hinder their practical applications. Herein, we have devised an
effective strategy to overcome these challenging shortcomings through
modification of chalcogen chemistry under the guidance of theoretical modeling.
The resultant Li6.25PS4O1.25Cl0.75 delivered excellent electrochemical
compatibility with both pure Li anode and high-voltage LiCoO2 cathode, without
detrimental impact upon the superb ionic conductivity of the pristine sulfide.
Furthermore, the current SSE also exhibited highly improved stability to oxygen
and moisture in air, with further advantage being more insulating to electrons.
The remarkably enhanced compatibility with electrodes is attributed to in situ
formation of solid anode electrolyte interphase (AEI) and cathode electrolyte
interphase (CEI) layers. The formation of in situ AEI enabled ultra-stable Li
plating/stripping at a record high current density up to 1 mAh cm-2 in
Li|Li6.25PS4O1.25Cl0.75|Li symmetric cells over 1800 hours. The in situ CEI
facilitated protection of the SSE from decomposition at elevated voltage.
Consequently, the synergistic effect of AEI and CEI helped the
LiCoO2|Li6.25PS4O1.25Cl0.75|Li battery cell to achieve markedly better cycling
stability than that using the pristine Li6PS5Cl as SSE, at a high areal loading

Moran model we consider is a non-reversible in general, continuous-time Markov
chain with an unknown stationary distribution. Specifically, we consider $N$

irreducible mutation process and by a reproduction process, where a pair of
individuals is randomly chosen, one of them dies and the other reproduces. Our
main result provides explicit expressions for the eigenvalues of the
infinitesimal generator matrix of the Moran process, in terms of the
eigenvalues of the jump rate matrix. As consequences of this result, we study
the convergence in total variation of the process to stationarity and show a
lower bound for the mixing time of the Moran process. Furthermore, we study in
detail the spectral decomposition of the neutral multi-allelic Moran model with
parent independent mutation scheme, which is the unique mutation scheme that
makes the neutral Moran process reversible. Under the parent independent
mutation, we also prove the existence of a cutoff phenomenon in the chi-square

absence of reproduction, we prove that the total variation distance to
stationarity of the parent independent mutation process when initially all the
individuals are of the same type has a Gaussian profile.

to exhibit an asymmetric Fano-like lineshape in all the three compounds,
indicating the presence of an interaction between the phonon and the electronic
continuum. The origin of the electronic continuum states and electron-phonon
coupling are discussed based on our laser power- and temperature-dependent
Raman results. We have observed an enhanced strength of electron-phonon
coupling in Sr0.85Li0.15Pd3O4 at low temperatures which can be attributed to
the metallicity in this doped compound.

part of most studies in the literature on mobile phone data. Despite its
widespread use, home detection relies on a few assumptions that are difficult
to check without ground truth, i.e., where the individual that owns the device
resides. In this paper, we provide an unprecedented evaluation of the accuracy
of home detection algorithms on a group of sixty-five participants for whom we
know their exact home address and the antennas that might serve them. Besides,
we analyze not only Call Detail Records (CDRs) but also two other mobile phone
streams: eXtended Detail Records (XDRs, the ``data'' channel) and Control Plane
Records (CPRs, the network stream). These data streams vary not only in their
temporal granularity but also they differ in the data generation mechanism',
e.g., CDRs are purely human-triggered while CPR is purely machine-triggered
events. Finally, we quantify the amount of data that is needed for each stream
to carry out successful home detection for each stream. We find that the choice
of stream and the algorithm heavily influences home detection, with an
hour-of-day algorithm for the XDRs performing the best, and with CPRs
performing best for the amount of data needed to perform home detection. Our
work is useful for researchers and practitioners in order to minimize data
requests and to maximize the accuracy of home antenna location.

star formation in galaxies. Recent analyses using the Hi data in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC) proposed that the tidally driven colliding HI flows,
induced by the galactic interaction with the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC),
triggered high-mass star formation in the southeastern HI Ridge, including R136
and $\sim$400 O/WR stars, and the galactic center region hosting the N44
region. This study performed a comprehensive HI data analysis across the LMC
and found that two Hi velocity components defined in the early studies (L- and
D- components) are quasi-ubiquitous with signatures of interaction dynamically
toward the other prominent HII regions, such as N11 and N79. We characterize
the intimidate velocity range (I-component) between the two components as the
decelerated gas by momentum conservation in the collisional interaction. The
spatial distributions of the I-component and those of the O/WR stars have good
agreements with each other whose fraction is more than $\sim$70% at a scale of
$\sim$15 pc, which is significantly smaller than the typical GMC size. Based on
the results of our new simulations of the LMC-SMC interaction, we propose that
the interaction about 0.2 Gyr ago induced efficient infall of gas from the SMC
to the LMC and consequently ended up with recent formation of high-mass stars
due to collisions of HI gas in the LMC. The new numerical simulations of the
gas dynamics successfully reproduce the current distribution of the
L-component. This lends theoretical support for the present picture.

solutions, while other energy conditions depend on the ratio between extreme
charges of isolated solutions. For solutions with four horizons, we present two
examples, Bardeen-Culetu and Balart-Culetu. Both solutions are regular, but the
first do not satisfy all the energy conditions, except the strong, because it
has an extreme charge ratio of 1.57581, great value. The second solution, on
the other hand, can satisfy all other energy conditions, except the SEC, and
has an extreme charge ratio of 1.09915, a value that allows this feature. It's
also proposed a regular solution with up to six horizons,
Balart-Culetu-Dymnikova, where, for a given charge value, we can verify that it
satisfies all energy conditions, except the strong one. This was possible due
to the ratio between extreme charges that are neither too high nor too close.
We propose solutions with any number of horizons. We show that points where
$-F(r)$ has a non null minimum represent a cusp in the Lagrangian $-L(F)$. We
also show an example of multihorizon solution with magnetic charge.
Multihorizon solutions may exhibit exotic properties, such as negative energy
density, or violation of energy conditions, but which can be circumvented with
a selected choice of customized solutions and extreme charge values, resulting
in regular black hole solutions that satisfy all energy conditions, less the
strong.

and achieve the scaling that \epsilon is inversely proportional to n. Recent

introducing classical communication, we experimentally implement an adaptive
quantum state verification. The constant-factor is minimized from ~2.5 to 1.5

worst-case, recursive, preference-based, and non-clashing models) and the
sequential settings (e.g., local preference-based model). To better understand
the connections between these models, we develop a novel framework that
captures the teaching process via preference functions $\Sigma$. In our

with teaching complexity as $TD(\sigma)$. We show that the above-mentioned
teaching models are equivalent to specific types/families of preference
functions. We analyze several properties of the teaching complexity parameter
$TD(\sigma)$ associated with different families of the preference functions,
e.g., comparison to the VC dimension of the hypothesis class and
additivity/sub-additivity of $TD(\sigma)$ over disjoint domains. Finally, we

the changes and updates due to pipeline evolution often cause cumbersome
coordination and maintenance work, raising the costs and making it hard to use.
Existing solutions, unfortunately, do not address the version evolution
problem, especially in a collaborative environment where non-linear version
control semantics are necessary to isolate operations made by different user
roles. The lack of version control semantics also incurs unnecessary storage
consumption and lowers efficiency due to data duplication and repeated data
pre-processing, which are avoidable. In this paper, we identify two main
challenges that arise during the deployment of machine learning pipelines, and
address them with the design of versioning for an end-to-end analytics system
MLCask. The system supports multiple user roles with the ability to perform
Git-like branching and merging operations in the context of the machine
learning pipelines. We define and accelerate the metric-driven merge operation
by pruning the pipeline search tree using reusable history records and pipeline
compatibility information. Further, we design and implement the prioritized
pipeline search, which gives preference to the pipelines that probably yield
better performance. The effectiveness of MLCask is evaluated through an
extensive study over several real-world deployment cases. The performance
evaluation shows that the proposed merge operation is up to 7.8x faster and
saves up to 11.9x storage space than the baseline method that does not utilize

  Analysis",,,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Twitter is a well-known microblogging social site where users express their
views and opinions in real-time. As a result, tweets tend to contain valuable
information. With the advancements of deep learning in the domain of natural
language processing, extracting meaningful information from tweets has become a
growing interest among natural language researchers. Applying existing language
representation models to extract information from Twitter does not often
produce good results. Moreover, there is no existing language representation
models for text analysis specific to the social media domain. Hence, in this
article, we introduce two TweetBERT models, which are domain specific language
presentation models, pre-trained on millions of tweets. We show that the
TweetBERT models significantly outperform the traditional BERT models in
Twitter text mining tasks by more than 7% on each Twitter dataset. We also
provide an extensive analysis by evaluating seven BERT models on 31 different
datasets. Our results validate our hypothesis that continuously training
language models on twitter corpus help performance with Twitter.

similarity with human's understanding and reasoning. This improves
interpretability, enables the performance of down-stream tasks, and enables
controllable generative models. However, this domain is challenged by the
abstract notion and incomplete theories to support unsupervised disentanglement
learning. We demonstrate the data itself, such as the orientation of images,
plays a crucial role in disentanglement and instead of the factors, and the
disentangled representations align the latent variables with the action
sequences. We further introduce the concept of disentangling action sequences
which facilitates the description of the behaviours of the existing
disentangling approaches. An analogy for this process is to discover the
commonality between the things and categorizing them. Furthermore, we analyze
the inductive biases on the data and find that the latent information
thresholds are correlated with the significance of the actions. For the
supervised and unsupervised settings, we respectively introduce two methods to
measure the thresholds. We further propose a novel framework, fractional
variational autoencoder (FVAE), to disentangle the action sequences with
different significance step-by-step. Experimental results on dSprites and 3D
Chairs show that FVAE improves the stability of disentanglement.

  Alignment","8 pages",,,,"cs.AI cs.DB cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Ontology Alignment is an important research problem that finds application in
various fields such as data integration, data transfer, data preparation etc.
State-of-the-art (SOTA) architectures in Ontology Alignment typically use naive
domain-dependent approaches with handcrafted rules and manually assigned
values, making them unscalable and inefficient. Deep Learning approaches for
ontology alignment use domain-specific architectures that are not only
in-extensible to other datasets and domains, but also typically perform worse
than rule-based approaches due to various limitations including over-fitting of
models, sparsity of datasets etc. In this work, we propose VeeAlign, a Deep
Learning based model that uses a dual-attention mechanism to compute the
contextualized representation of a concept in order to learn alignments. By
doing so, not only does our approach exploit both syntactic and semantic
structure of ontologies, it is also, by design, flexible and scalable to
different domains with minimal effort. We validate our approach on various
datasets from different domains and in multilingual settings, and show its
superior performance over SOTA methods.

and Timing (PNT) services for autonomous vehicles (AVs) using satellites and
radio communications. Due to the lack of encryption, open-access of the coarse
acquisition (C/A) codes, and low strength of the signal, GNSS is vulnerable to
spoofing attacks compromising the navigational capability of the AV. A spoofed
attack is difficult to detect as a spoofer (attacker who performs spoofing
attack) can mimic the GNSS signal and transmit inaccurate location coordinates
to an AV. In this study, we have developed a prediction-based spoofing attack
detection strategy using the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a recurrent
neural network model. The LSTM model is used to predict the distance traveled
between two consecutive locations of an autonomous vehicle. In order to develop
the LSTM prediction model, we have used a publicly available real-world
comma2k19 driving dataset. The training dataset contains different features
(i.e., acceleration, steering wheel angle, speed, and distance traveled between
two consecutive locations) extracted from the controlled area network (CAN),
GNSS, and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors of AVs. Based on the
predicted distance traveled between the current location and the immediate
future location of an autonomous vehicle, a threshold value is established
using the positioning error of the GNSS device and prediction error (i.e.,
maximum absolute error) related to distance traveled between the current
location and the immediate future location. Our analysis revealed that the
prediction-based spoofed attack detection strategy can successfully detect the
attack in real-time.

non-roboticist end-users to teach robots to perform a task by providing a human

learning (IRL), assume users provide at least stochastically optimal
demonstrations. This assumption fails to hold in most real-world scenarios.
Recent attempts to learn from sub-optimal demonstration leverage pairwise
rankings and following the Luce-Shepard rule. However, we show these approaches
make incorrect assumptions and thus suffer from brittle, degraded performance.
We overcome these limitations in developing a novel approach that bootstraps
off suboptimal demonstrations to synthesize optimality-parameterized data to
train an idealized reward function. We empirically validate we learn an
idealized reward function with ~0.95 correlation with ground-truth reward
versus ~0.75 for prior work. We can then train policies achieving ~200%
improvement over the suboptimal demonstration and ~90% improvement over prior
work. We present a physical demonstration of teaching a robot a topspin strike
in table tennis that achieves 32% faster returns and 40% more topspin than user
demonstration.

after the research community has made profound progress in supervised learning

novel approaches that would harness the imperfect data and improve the
data-efficiency during training. A massive amount of user-generated data
nowadays available on multiple internet services. How to leverage those and
improve the machine learning models is a high impact problem. We organize the
challenges in conjunction with the workshop. The goal of these challenges is to
find the state-of-the-art approaches in the weakly supervised learning setting
for object detection, semantic segmentation, and scene parsing. There are three
tracks in the challenge, i.e., weakly supervised semantic segmentation (Track
1), weakly supervised scene parsing (Track 2), and weakly supervised object
localization (Track 3). In Track 1, based on ILSVRC DET, we provide pixel-level
annotations of 15K images from 200 categories for evaluation. In Track 2, we
provide point-based annotations for the training set of ADE20K. In Track 3,
based on ILSVRC CLS-LOC, we provide pixel-level annotations of 44,271 images
for evaluation. Besides, we further introduce a new evaluation metric proposed
by \cite{zhang2020rethinking}, i.e., IoU curve, to measure the quality of the
generated object localization maps. This technical report summarizes the
highlights from the challenge. The challenge submission server and the
leaderboard will continue to open for the researchers who are interested in it.

generation of two dimensional molecules as SMILES strings and molecular graphs.
In this work we describe for the first time a deep generative model that can
generate 3D molecular structures conditioned on a three-dimensional (3D)
binding pocket. Using convolutional neural networks, we encode atomic density
grids into separate receptor and ligand latent spaces. The ligand latent space
is variational to support sampling of new molecules. A decoder network
generates atomic densities of novel ligands conditioned on the receptor.
Discrete atoms are then fit to these continuous densities to create molecular
structures. We show that valid and unique molecules can be readily sampled from
the variational latent space defined by a reference `seed' structure and
generated structures have reasonable interactions with the binding site. As
structures are sampled farther in latent space from the seed structure, the
novelty of the generated structures increases, but the predicted binding
affinity decreases. Overall, we demonstrate the feasibility of conditional 3D
molecular structure generation and provide a starting point for methods that
also explicitly optimize for desired molecular properties, such as high binding
affinity.

hierarchical multitask learning approaches for BERT pre-training. Pre-training
tasks are solved at different layers instead of the last layer, and information
from the NSP task is transferred to the masked LM task. Also, we propose a new

downstream tasks, one of which requires sentence-level embeddings (textual
