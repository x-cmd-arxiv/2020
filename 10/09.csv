into account in the strong-field QED processes of nonlinear Compton emission
and pair production, we find that the growth rate of QED cascades in
ultra-intense laser fields can be substantially reduced. While this means that
fewer particles are produced, we also found them to be highly polarized. We
further find that the high-energy tail of the particle spectra is polarized
opposite to that expected from Sokolov-Ternov theory, which cannot be explained
by just taking into account spin-asymmetries in the pair production process,
but results significantly from ""spin-straggling"". We employ a kinetic equation
approach for the electron, positron and photon distributions, each of them
spin/polarization-resolved, with the QED effects of photon emission and pair
production modelled by a spin/polarization dependent Boltzmann-type collision
operator. For photon-seeded cascades, depending on the photon polarization, we
find an excess or a shortage of particle production in the early stages of
cascade development, which provides a path towards a controlled experiment.
Throughout this paper we focus on rotating electric field configuration, which
represent an idealized model and allows for a straightforward interpretation of
the observed effects.

some specific distribution (i.e. Poisson, Bernoulli, and Gaussian), and solve
the factorization by minimizing some empirical loss functions defined based on
the corresponding distribution. However, it suffers from several drawbacks: 1)
In reality, the underlying distributions are complicated and unknown, making it
infeasible to be approximated by a simple distribution. 2) The correlation
across dimensions of the input tensor is not well utilized, leading to
sub-optimal performance. Although heuristics were proposed to incorporate such
correlation as side information under Gaussian distribution, they can not
easily be generalized to other distributions. Thus, a more principled way of
utilizing the correlation in tensor factorization models is still an open
challenge. Without assuming any explicit distribution, we formulate the tensor
factorization as an optimal transport problem with Wasserstein distance, which
can handle non-negative inputs.
  We introduce SWIFT, which minimizes the Wasserstein distance that measures
the distance between the input tensor and that of the reconstruction. In
particular, we define the N-th order tensor Wasserstein loss for the widely
used tensor CP factorization and derive the optimization algorithm that
minimizes it. By leveraging sparsity structure and different equivalent
formulations for optimizing computational efficiency, SWIFT is as scalable as
other well-known CP algorithms. Using the factor matrices as features, SWIFT
achieves up to 9.65% and 11.31% relative improvement over baselines for
downstream prediction tasks. Under the noisy conditions, SWIFT achieves up to

powerful source of observable stochastic gravitational waves. While bubble
nucleation is non-perturbative in 5D gravity, it is amenable to semiclassical
treatment in terms of a ""bounce"" configuration interpolating between the two
phases. We demonstrate how such a bounce configuration can be smooth enough to
maintain 5D effective field theory control, and how a simple ansatz for it
places a rigorous lower-bound on the transition rate in the thin-wall regime,
and gives plausible estimates more generally. When applied to the Hierarchy

to a slow transition with significant supercooling. We demonstrate that a
simple generalization of the Goldberger-Wise potential modifies the IR-brane
dynamics so that the transition completes more promptly. Supercooling
determines the dilution of any (dark) matter abundances generated before the
transition, potentially at odds with data, while the prompter transition
resolves such tensions. We discuss the impact of the different possibilities on
the strength of the gravitational wave signals. Via AdS/CFT duality the warped

Intelligence (SETI) grows, so does interest in the more controversial endeavour
of Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI). METI proponents point to the
SETI Paradox - if all civilisations refrain from METI then SETI is futile. I
introduce Mutual Detectability as a game-theoretic strategy aimed at increasing
the success potential of targeted SETI. Mutual detectability is embodied by
four laws: mutuality, symmetry, opportunity and superiority. These laws
establish how SETI participants can engage each other using game theory
principles applied to mutual evidence of mutual existence. The law of
superiority establishes an ""onus to transmit"" on the party whom both SETI
participants can judge to have better quality evidence, or common denominator
information (CDI), thus avoiding the SETI Paradox. I argue that transiting
exoplanets within the Earth Transit Zone form a target subset that satisfies
mutual detectability requirements. I identify the intrinsic time-integrated
transit signal strength as suitable CDI. Civilisations on habitable-zone
planets of radius $R_{\rm p}/R_{\oplus} \lesssim (L_*/L_{\odot})^{-1/7}$ have
superior CDI on us, so have game-theory incentive (onus) to transmit. Whilst
this implies that the onus to transmit falls on us for habitable planets around
$L_* > L_{\odot}$ stars, considerations of relative stellar frequency,
main-sequence lifetime and planet occurrence mean such systems are likely a
small minority. Surveys of the Earth Transit Zone for Earth-analogue transits
around sub-solar luminosity hosts, followed up by targeted SETI monitoring of
them, represent an efficient strategy compliant with mutual detectability. A
choice to remain silent, by not engaging in METI towards such systems, does not
in this case fuel concerns of a SETI Paradox.

introducing a new non-dimensional mixing-length function. The new mixing-length

of the commonly used pressure-gradient parameters. As a result, the newly
introduced mixing-length function exhibits great universality within the
viscous sublayer, the buffer layer, and the log region (i.e., $0 < y <
0.1\delta$, where the wall model is typically deployed in a WMLES setup). The
performance of the new model is validated by predicting a wide range of

Clauser pressure-gradient parameter between -0.3 and 4. Compared to the
classical equilibrium wall model, remarkable error reduction in terms of the

  by stronger interlayer van der Waals coupling",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Defect-free epitaxial growth of 2D materials is one of the holy grails for a
successful integration of van der Waals (vdW) materials in the semiconductor
industry. The large-area (quasi-)vdW epitaxy of layered 2D chalcogenides is
consequently carefully being researched since these materials hold very
promising properties for future nanoelectronic applications. The formation of
defects such as stacking faults like 60o twins and consequently 60o grain
boundaries is still of major concern for the defect-free epitaxial growth of 2D
chalcogenides. Although growth strategies to overcome the occurrence of these
defects are currently being considered, more fundamental understanding on the
origin of these defects at the initial stages of the growth is highly
essential. Therefore this work focuses on the understanding of 60o twin
formation in (quasi-)vdW epitaxy of 2D chalcogenides relying on systematic
molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) experiments supported by density functional theory
(DFT) calculations. The MBE experiments reveal the striking difference in 60o
twin formation between WSe2 and Bi2Se3 in both quasi-vdW heteroepitaxy and vdW
homoepitaxy, which from our DFT calculations links to the difference in
interlayer vdW coupling strength. The stronger interlayer vdW coupling in
Bi2Se3 compared to WSe2 results in a striking enhanced control on twin
formation and hence shows significantly more promise for defect-free epitaxial
integration. This interesting aspect of (quasi-)vdW epitaxy reveals that the
strength of interlayer vdW coupling is key for functional 2D materials and
opens perspectives for other vdW materials sharing strong interlayer
interactions.

learning. These problems have a set of optimal solutions, called the Pareto
front, where each point on the front represents a different trade-off between
possibly conflicting objectives. Recent MOO methods can target a specific
desired ray in loss space however, most approaches still face two grave
limitations: (i) A separate model has to be trained for each point on the
front; and (ii) The exact trade-off must be known before the optimization
process. Here, we tackle the problem of learning the entire Pareto front, with
the capability of selecting a desired operating point on the front after
training. We call this new setup Pareto-Front Learning (PFL).
  We describe an approach to PFL implemented using HyperNetworks, which we term
Pareto HyperNetworks (PHNs). PHN learns the entire Pareto front simultaneously
using a single hypernetwork, which receives as input a desired preference
vector and returns a Pareto-optimal model whose loss vector is in the desired
ray. The unified model is runtime efficient compared to training multiple
models and generalizes to new operating points not used during training. We
evaluate our method on a wide set of problems, from multi-task regression and
classification to fairness. PHNs learn the entire Pareto front at roughly the
same time as learning a single point on the front and at the same time reach a
better solution set. Furthermore, we show that PHNs can scale to generate large
models like ResNet18. PFL opens the door to new applications where models are
selected based on preferences that are only available at run time.

jump that can be seen in kitchen sinks is created by gravity. However, we
recently reported that these jumps are created by surface tension, and gravity
does not play a significant role. In this paper, {we present experimental data
for hydraulic jump experiments conducted in a micro-gravity environment
($\approx 2\%$ of Earth's gravity) (Avedisian \& Zhao 2000; Painter et al.
2007; Phillips et al. 2008). The existence of a hydraulic jump in micro-gravity
unequivocally confirms that gravity is not the principal force causing the
formation of the kitchen sink hydraulic jump.} We also present thirteen sets of
experimental data conducted under terrestrial gravity reported in the
literature for jumps in the steady-state for a range of liquids with different
physical parameters, flow rates and experimental conditions. There is good
agreement with {Bhagat et al.}'s theoretical predictions. We also show that
beyond a critical flow rate, $Q_C^* \propto \gamma^2 /\nu \rho^2 g$, gravity
does influence the hydraulic jumps. At lower flow rates, at the scale of the
kitchen sink, surface tension is the dominating force. We discuss previously
reported phenomenological and predictive models of hydraulic jumps and show
that the phenomenological model -- effectively a statement of continuity of
radial momentum across the jump -- does not allow the mechanism of the origin
of the jump to be identified. However, combining the phenomenological model and
{Bhagat et al.}'s theory allows us to predict the height of the jump.

works to introduce models that both perform a task and generate NL explanations

evaluated on the basis of surface-level similarities to human explanations,
both through automatic metrics like BLEU and human evaluations. We argue that
these evaluations are insufficient, since they fail to indicate whether
explanations support actual model behavior (faithfulness), rather than simply
match what a human would say (plausibility). In this work, we address the
problem of evaluating explanations from the model simulatability perspective.
Our contributions are as follows: (1) We introduce a leakage-adjusted
simulatability (LAS) metric for evaluating NL explanations, which measures how
well explanations help an observer predict a model's output, while controlling
for how explanations can directly leak the output. We use a model as a proxy
for a human observer, and validate this choice with two human subject
experiments. (2) Using the CoS-E and e-SNLI datasets, we evaluate two existing
generative graphical models and two new approaches; one rationalizing method we
introduce achieves roughly human-level LAS scores. (3) Lastly, we frame
explanation generation as a multi-agent game and optimize explanations for
simulatability while penalizing label leakage, which can improve LAS scores. We
provide code for the experiments in this paper at

between a complete regular structure and a random system. Brain signals can be
studied as a striking example of such systems: cortical states can range from
highly synchronous and ordered neuronal activity (with higher spiking
variability) to desynchronized and disordered regimes (with lower spiking
variability). It has been recently shown, by testing independent signatures of
criticality, that a phase transition occurs in a cortical state of intermediate
spiking variability. Here, we use a symbolic information approach to show that,
despite the monotonical increase of the Shannon entropy between ordered and
disordered regimes, we can determine an intermediate state of maximum
complexity based on the Jensen disequilibrium measure. More specifically, we
show that statistical complexity is maximized close to criticality for cortical

outcomes of our HelpNeed predictor: productive vs. unproductive. Our results
show that the students in the Adaptive condition exhibited better training

chance of receiving help when it was likely to be needed), as measured using
the HelpNeed classifier, when compared to the Control. Furthermore, the results
show that the students who received Adaptive hints based on HelpNeed

large scale systematic study to identify the impact of each source parameter on
the measurement of precession. We simulate a fiducial binary at moderate
mass-ratio, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and spins, such that precession will
be clearly identifiable, then successively vary each parameter while holding
the remaining parameters fixed. As expected, evidence for precession increases
with signal-to noise-ratio (SNR), higher in-plane spins, more unequal component
masses, and higher inclination, but our study provides a quantitative
illustration of each of these effects, and informs our intuition on parameter
dependencies that have not yet been studied in detail, for example, the effect
of varying the relative strength of the two polarisations, the total mass, and
the aligned-spin components. We also measure the ""precession SNR"" $\rho_p$,
which was introduced in Refs[1,2] to quantify the signal power associated with
precession. By comparing $\rho_p$ with both Bayes factors and the recovered

crucial in parallel model building in three dimensions. Motivated by this we
here use the latter models to compute the subregion complexity of the Hawking
quanta of the evaporating BH in AdS$_{3}$ and obtain the Page curve associated
with this information theoretic measure. We use three- and $n$-boundary

represented by the growing length of the throat horizons corresponding to
smaller exits of the multi-boundary wormhole and the evaporating bigger exit
shrinks with evolving time. We track the change in choice of HRT surfaces with
time and plot the volume with time. The smooth transition of Page curve is
realized by a discontinuous jump at Page time in volume subregion complexity
plots and the usual Page transition is realized as a phase transition due to
the inclusion of the island in this context. We discuss mathematical
intricacies and physical insights regarding the inclusion of the extra volume
at Page time. The analysis is backed by calculations and lessons from kinematic

phenomenological, parameterized models of QE scattering cross sections.
Moreover, a culture of validation of MC$\nu$EGs against prolific electron ($e$)

$e A$ cross sections obtained from nuclear ab initio approaches in GENIE, the
primary MC$\nu$EG utilized by the FNAL community. In particular, we utilize
results from Quantum MC methods which solve the many-body nuclear problem in
the Short-Time Approximation (STA), allowing consistent retention of
two-nucleon dynamics which are crucial to explain available nuclear
electromagnetic (electroweak) data over a wide range of energy and momentum
transfers. This new implementation in GENIE is fully tested against the world
QE electromagnetic data, finding agreement with available data below
$\sim2\,$GeV of beam energy with the aid of a scaling function formalism. The
STA is currently limited to study $A\leq12$ nuclei, however, its semi-inclusive
multibody identity components are exportable to other many-body computational
techniques such as Auxiliary Field Diffusion MC which can reach $A\leq40$
systems while continuing to realize the factorization contained within the
STA's multinucleon dynamics. Together, these developments promise to make
future experiments such as DUNE more accurate in their assessment of MC$\nu$EG
systematics, $\nu$ properties, and potentially empower the discovery of physics

the distance duality parameter $\eta(z)$ without relying on multiple datasets

luminosity distances. In this paper, we show how this can be achieved by future
observations of strongly lensed Type Ia systems. Using simulated datasets, we
reconstruct the function $\eta(z)$ using both parametric and non-parametric
approaches, focusing on Genetic Algorithms and Gaussian processes for the
latter. In the parametric approach, we find that in the realistic scenario of
$N_{\rm lens}=20$ observed systems, the parameter $\epsilon_0$ used to describe
the trend of $\eta(z)$ can be constrained with the precision achieved by
current SNIa and BAO surveys, while in the futuristic case ($N_{\rm
lens}=1000$) these observations could be competitive with the forecast
precision of upcoming LSS and SN surveys. Using the machine learning approaches
of Genetic Algorithms and Gaussian processes, we find that both reconstruction
methods are generally well able to correctly recover the underlying fiducial
model in the mock data, even in the realistic case of $N_{\rm lens}=20$. Both
approaches learn effectively from the features of the mock data points,
yielding $1\sigma$ constraints that are in excellent agreement with the

effect. The host system's overall architecture is an hierarchical quadruple in
the '2+2' configuration, owing to the presence of a tertiary companion system
of two M-dwarfs. We show that a secular inclination resonance in 2+2 systems
can significantly broaden the LK window for extreme eccentricity excitation ($e
\gtrsim 0.999$), allowing the giant planet to migrate for a wide range of
initial orbital inclinations. Octupole effects can also contribute to the
broadening of this 'extreme' LK window. By requiring that perturbations from
the companion stars be able to overcome short-range forces and excite the
planet's eccentricity to $e \simeq 1$, we obtain an absolute limit of $a_{1}
\gtrsim 8 \, {\rm AU} \, (a_{3} / 1500 \, {\rm AU})^{6/7}$ for the planet's
semi-major axis just before migration (where $a_{3}$ is the semi-major axis of
the 'outer' orbit). We suggest that, to achieve a wide LK window through the
2+2 resonance, WD1856b likely migrated from $30 \, {\rm AU} \lesssim a_{1}
\lesssim 60 \, {\rm AU}$, corresponding to $\sim 10$--$20 \, {\rm AU}$ during
the host's main-sequence phase. We discuss possible difficulties of all
flavours of HEM affecting the occurrence rate of short-period giant planets

the building blocks of massive cluster central galaxies are drawn from a
special subset of the overall low-mass galaxy population. Here we explore this
idea in the IllustrisTNG simulations, particularly the TNG300 run, in order to
understand how environment, especially cluster centers, shape the star
formation histories of quiescent satellite galaxies in groups and clusters
($M_{200c,z=0}\geq10^{13} M_{\odot}$). Tracing histories of quenched satellite
galaxies with $M_{\star,z=0}\geq10^{10} M_{\odot}$, we find that those in more
massive dark matter halos, and located closer to the primary galaxies, are
quenched earlier, have shorter star formation timescales, and older stellar
ages. The star formation timescale-$M_{\star}$ and stellar age-$M_{\star}$
scaling relations are in good agreement with observations, and are predicted to
vary with halo mass and cluster-centric distance. The dependence on environment
arises due to the infall histories of satellite galaxies: galaxies that are
located closer to cluster centers in more massive dark matter halos at $z=0$
were accreted earlier on average. The delay between infall and quenching time
is shorter for galaxies in more massive halos, and depends on the halo mass at
its first accretion, showing that group pre-processing is a crucial aspect in

time series of dMe flare stars and other stellar sources. Such periodic
signals, observed within quiescent phases (i.e., devoid of larger-scale
microflare or flare activity), range in period from $1-1000$ seconds and hence
have been tentatively linked to ubiquitous $p$-mode oscillations generated in
the convective layers of the star. As such, most interpretations for the
observed periodicities have been framed in terms of magneto-hydrodynamic wave
behavior. However, we propose that a series of continuous nanoflares, based
upon a power-law distribution, can provide a similar periodic signal in the
associated time series. Adapting previous statistical analyses of solar
nanoflare signals, we find the first statistical evidence for stellar nanoflare
signals embedded within the noise envelope of M-type stellar lightcurves.
Employing data collected by the Next Generation Transit Survey (NGTS), we find
evidence for stellar nanoflare activity demonstrating a flaring power-law index
of $3.25 \pm 0.20 $, alongside a decay timescale of $200 \pm 100$ s. We also
find that synthetic time series, consistent with the observations of dMe flare
star lightcurves, are capable of producing quasi-periodic signals in the same
frequency range as $p$-mode signals, despite being purely comprised of
impulsive signatures. Phenomena traditionally considered a consequence of wave
behaviour may be described by a number of high frequency but discrete nanoflare
energy events. This new physical interpretation presents a novel diagnostic
capability, by linking observed periodic signals to given nanoflare model
conditions.

model that includes the assembly bias of central and satellite galaxies,
parameterized as $\mathcal{Q}_\mathrm{cen}$ and $\mathcal{Q}_\mathrm{sat}$,

particular, our fiducial constraint employs the probability distribution of the

the projected cross-correlation functions of quintiles of galaxies selected by
$N_8^g$ with our entire galaxy sample. We perform extensive tests of the

the ELUCID reconstruction effectively removes an otherwise strong degeneracy

maximum allowed magnetic field in a star. Recent studies have proposed the
existence of highly magnetized white dwarfs, with masses significantly higher
than the Chandrasekhar limit. Surface magnetic fields of such white dwarfs
could be more than 10^9 G with the central magnitude several orders higher.
These white dwarfs could be significantly smaller in size than their ordinary
counterparts (with surface fields restricted to about 10^9 G). In this paper we
reformulate the virial theorem for non-rotating, highly magnetized white dwarfs
(B-WDs) in which, unlike in previous formulations, the contribution of the
magnetic pressure to the magnetohydrostatic balance cannot be neglected. Along
with the new equation of magnetohydrostatic equilibrium, we approach the
problem by invoking magnetic flux conservation and by varying the internal
magnetic field with the matter density as a power law. Either of these choices
are supported by previous independent work and neither violates any important
physics. They are useful while there is no prior knowledge of field profile
within a white dwarf. We then compute the modified gravitational, thermal and
magnetic energies and examine how the magnetic pressure influences the
properties of such white dwarfs. Based on our results we predict important
properties of these B-WDs, which turn out to be independent of our chosen field
profiles.

apparent alignments in the shapes of distant galaxies can be accurately
measured. Most studies have therefore focused on improving the fidelity of the
shape measurements themselves, but the preceding step of object detection has
been largely ignored. In this paper we study the impact of object detection for
a Euclid-like survey and show that it leads to biases that exceed requirements
for the next generation of cosmic shear surveys. In realistic scenarios,
blending of galaxies is an important source of detection bias. We find that
MetaDetection is able to account for blending, leading to average
multiplicative biases that meet requirements for Stage IV surveys, provided a
sufficiently accurate model for the point spread function is available. Further
work is needed to estimate the performance for actual surveys. Combined with
sufficiently realistic image simulations, this provides a viable way forward
towards accurate shear estimates for Stage IV surveys.

gravity. As usual, we consider a canonical $U(1)$ symmetry-breaking model in
which the axion is the phase of a complex scalar field. If the complex scalar
field has a nonminimal coupling to gravity, then the (oft-forgotten) radial
component can drive a phase of inflation prior to an inflationary phase driven
by the axion field. In this setup, the mass of the axion field is dependent on
the radial field because of the nonminimal coupling, and the axion remains
extremely light during the phase of radial inflation. As the radial field
approaches the minimum of its potential, there is a transition to natural
inflation in the angular direction. In the language of multifield inflation,
this system exhibits ultra-light isocurvature perturbations, which are
converted to adiabatic perturbations at a fast turn, namely the onset of axion
inflation. For models wherein the CMB pivot scale exited the horizon during
radial inflation, this acts to suppresses the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$,
without generating CMB non-Gaussianity or observable isocurvature
perturbations. Finally, we note that the interaction strength between axion and
gauge fields is suppressed during the radial phase relative to its value during
the axion inflation phase by several orders of magnitude. This decouples the
constraints on the inflationary production of gauge fields (e.g., from
primordial black holes) from the constraints on their production during
(p)reheating.

modeling galaxy clustering on non-linear scales. Recent studies have found that
halo concentration by itself cannot capture the full galaxy assembly bias
effect and that the local environment of the halo can be an excellent indicator
of galaxy assembly bias. In this paper, we propose an extended halo occupation
distribution model (HOD) that includes both a concentration-based assembly bias
term and an environment-based assembly bias term. We use this model to achieve
a good fit (chi^2/DoF = 1.35) on the 2D redshift-space 2-point correlation
function (2PCF) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) CMASS
galaxy sample. We find that the inclusion of both assembly bias terms is
strongly favored by the data and the standard 5-parameter HOD is strongly
rejected. More interestingly, the redshift-space 2PCF drives the assembly bias
parameters in a way that preferentially assigns galaxies to lower mass halos.
This results in galaxy-galaxy lensing predictions that are within 1sigma
agreement with the observation, alleviating the perceived tension between
galaxy clustering and lensing. We also showcase a consistent 3-5sigma
preference for a positive environment-based assembly bias that persists over
variations in the fit. We speculate that the environmental dependence might be
driven by underlying processes such as mergers and feedback, but might also be
indicative of a larger halo boundaries such as the splashback radius.
Regardless, this work highlights the importance of building flexible
galaxy-halo connection models and demonstrates the extra constraining power of
the redshift-space 2PCF.

WIMPs, but the viable parameter space is quickly shrinking. Asymmetric Dark
Matter (ADM) is a WIMP-like DM candidate with slightly smaller masses and no
present day annihilation, meaning that stars can capture and build up large
quantities. The captured ADM can transport energy through a significant volume
of the star. We investigate the effects of spin-dependent ADM energy transport
on stellar structure and evolution in stars with $0.9 \leq
M_{\star}/\mathrm{M}_{\odot} \leq 5.0$ in varying DM environments. We wrote a
MESA module that calculates the capture of DM and the subsequent energy
transport within the star. We fix the DM mass to 5 GeV and the cross section to
$10^{-37} \mathrm{cm{^2}}$, and study varying environments by scaling the DM
capture rate. For stars with radiative cores ($M_{\star} \lesssim 1.3\
\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), the presence of ADM flattens the temperature and burning
profiles in the core and increases MS ($X_c > 10^{-3}$) lifetimes by up to
$\sim 20\%$. We find that strict requirements on energy conservation are
crucial to the simulation of ADM's effects on these stars. In higher-mass
stars, ADM energy transport shuts off core convection, limiting available fuel
and shortening MS lifetimes by up to $\sim 40\%$. This may translate to changes
in the luminosity and effective temperature of the MS turnoff in population
isochrones. The tip of the red giant branch may occur at lower luminosities.
The effects are largest in DM environments with high densities and/or low
velocity dispersions, making dwarf and early forming galaxies most likely to
display the effects.

However, a consistent picture that links these universal radial profiles and
the integrated values of the thermodynamical quantities of the intracluster
medium, also quantifying the deviations from the standard self-similar
gravity-driven scenario, has to be demonstrated. In this work, we use a
semi-analytic model based on a universal pressure profile in hydrostatic
equilibrium within a cold dark matter halo with a defined relation between mass
and concentration to reconstruct the scaling laws between the X-ray properties
of galaxy clusters. We also quantify any deviation from the self-similar
predictions in terms of temperature dependence of a few physical quantities
such as the gas mass fraction, the relation between spectroscopic temperature
and its global value, and, if present, the hydrostatic mass bias. This model
allows to reconstruct both the observed profiles and the scaling laws between
integrated quantities. We use the Planck-selected ESZ sample to calibrate the
predicted scaling laws between gas mass, temperature, luminosity and total
mass. Our universal model reproduces well the observed thermodynamic properties

self-similar behaviour. By combining these results with the constraints on the

vanishes when a bias magnetic field acts perpendicular to the NV axis. Here, we
introduce a novel sensing strategy assisted by the nitrogen nuclear spin that
uses the entanglement between the electron and nuclear spins to restore the
magnetic field sensitivity. This, in turn, allows us to detect small changes in
the magnetic field angle relative to the NV axis. Furthermore, based on the

PDEs and scattered data approximation of heterogeneous functions: the coarse
variables selected for deriving an upscaled equation (in the former) correspond
to the sampled information used for approximation (in the latter). As such,
both problems can be thought of as recovering a target function based on some
coarse data that are either artificially chosen by an upscaling algorithm, or
determined by some physical measurement process. The purpose of this paper is
then to study that, under such a setup and for a specific elliptic problem, how
the lengthscale of the coarse data, which we refer to as the subsampled
lengthscale, influences the accuracy of recovery, given limited computational
budgets. Our analysis and experiments identify that, reducing the subsampling
lengthscale may improve the accuracy, implying a guiding criterion for
coarse-graining or data acquisition in this computationally constrained
scenario, especially leading to direct insights for the implementation of the
Gamblets method in the numerical homogenization literature. Moreover, reducing
the lengthscale to zero may lead to a blow-up of approximation error if the
target function does not have enough regularity, suggesting the need for a
stronger prior assumption on the target function to be approximated. We
introduce a singular weight function to deal with it, both theoretically and
numerically. This work sheds light on the interplay of the lengthscale of
coarse data, the computational costs, the regularity of the target function,
and the accuracy of approximations and numerical simulations.

different mechanisms: a quasi-adiabatic heating process during magnetic field
compression, characterized by the isotropic temperature relation
$T/B=(T_0/B_0)(B_0/B)^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha=2/3$ when the electron heating
function $|\chi_e|<1$, and a stochastic heating process when $|\chi_e|>1$. Both
processes are controlled by the value of the stochastic heating function
$\chi_j = m_j q_j^{-1} B^{-2}\mathrm{div}(\mathbf{E}_\perp)$ for particles with
mass $m_j$ and charge $q_j$ in the electric and magnetic fields $\mathbf{E}$

stochastic electron heating and acceleration in the studied shock is
accomplished by waves at frequencies (0.4 - 5) $f_{ce}$ (electron
gyrofrequency) for bulk heating, and waves $f>5\,f_{ce}$ for acceleration of
the tail of the distribution function. Stochastic heating can give rise to
flat-top electron distribution functions, frequently observed near shocks. It
is also shown that obliquely polarized electric fields of electron cyclotron
drift (ECD) and ion acoustic instabilities scatter the electrons into the
parallel direction and keep the isotropy of the electron distribution. The
results reported in this paper may be relevant to electron heating and

differently, it tries to prevent an adversary from fooling a model. The study
of adversarial robustness is largely focused on $\ell_p-$bounded adversarial
perturbations, i.e. modifications of the inputs, bounded in some $\ell_p$ norm.
Nevertheless, it has been shown that state-of-the-art models are also

rotation is studied in unprecedented detail. At $T_{\rm eff}<5500$ K there is a
strong relationship between faster rotation and less Li depletion, although
with a dispersion larger than measurement uncertainties. Components of
photometrically identified binary systems follow the same relationship. A
correlation is also established between faster rotation rate (or smaller Rossby
number), decreased Li depletion and larger stellar radius at a given $T_{\rm
eff}$. These results support models where starspots and interior magnetic
fields lead to inflated radii and reduced Li depletion during the pre main
sequence (PMS) phase for the fastest rotators. However, the data are also
consistent with the idea that all stars suffered lower levels of Li depletion
than predicted by standard PMS models, perhaps because of deficiencies in those
models or because saturated levels of magnetic activity suppress Li depletion
equally in PMS stars of similar $T_{\rm eff}$ regardless of rotation rate, and
that slower rotators subsequently experience more mixing and post-PMS Li
depletion.

association, previously noted to display both high-frequency radial velocity
(RV) variability and magnetospheric H$\alpha$ emission. We have analysed the
TESS light curve, and find that it is a $\beta$ Cep pulsator with 11 detectable
frequencies, 4 of which are independent $p$-modes. The strongest frequency is
also detectable in RVs from ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy. RVs also
show a long-term variation, suggestive of orbital motion with a period of
$\sim$years; significant differences in the frequencies determined from TESS
and RV datasets are consistent with a light-time effect from orbital motion.
Close examination of the star's spectrum reveals the presence of a
spectroscopic companion, however as its RV is not variable it cannot be
responsible for the orbital motion and we therefore infer that the system is a
hierarchical triple with a so-far undetected third star. Reanalysis of LSD
profiles from ESPaDOnS and HARPSpol spectropolarimetry reveals the surprising
presence of a strong magnetic field in the companion star, with $\langle B_z
\rangle$ about $+1.5$ kG as compared to $\langle B_z \rangle \sim -0.8$ kG for
the primary. HD 156424 is thus the second hot binary with two magnetic stars.
We are unable to identify a rotational period for HD 156424A. The
magnetospheric H$\alpha$ emission appears to originate around HD 156424B. Using
H$\alpha$, as well as other variable spectral lines, we determine a period of
about 0.52 d, making HD 156424B one of the most rapidly rotating magnetic hot

several-degree localization accuracy with detector areas of 100 cm$^2$. In
order to achieve this, careful attention must be paid to systematics. This
includes accurate photon timing ($\sim$ 0.1 ms), good energy resolution ($\sim$
10\%), and reduction of Earth albedo, which are all within current
capabilities. Such a network can be scaled in both the number and size of

localization which does not rely on on-board trigger systems or on the
cross-correlation of time histories, but rather, in ground processing, tests
positions over the entire sky and assigns probabilities to them to detect and
localize events. We demonstrate its capabilities with simulations. If the NEN
spacecraft can downlink at least several hundred time- and energy-tagged events
per second, and the data can be ground-processed as they are received, it can

horizon, or beyond the Einstein-Rosen bridge, tunnels to outside the horizon,

two faces of the Hawking radiation process can be extended to not only

scientific disciplines. We introduce a novel load forecasting method in which
observed dynamics are modeled as a forced linear system using Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (DMD) in time delay coordinates. Central to this approach is the
insight that grid load, like many observables on complex real-world systems,
has an ""almost-periodic"" character, i.e., a continuous Fourier spectrum
punctuated by dominant peaks, which capture regular (e.g., daily or weekly)
recurrences in the dynamics. The forecasting method presented takes advantage
of this property by (i) regressing to a deterministic linear model whose
eigenspectrum maps onto those peaks, and (ii) simultaneously learning a
stochastic Gaussian process regression (GPR) process to actuate this system.
Our forecasting algorithm is compared against state-of-the-art forecasting
techniques not using additional explanatory variables and is shown to produce
superior performance. Moreover, its use of linear intrinsic dynamics offers a
number of desirable properties in terms of interpretability and parsimony.
Results are presented for a test case using load data from an electrical grid.
Load forecasting is an essential challenge in power systems engineering, with
major implications for real-time control, pricing, maintenance, and security
decisions.

outflows originating in a coronal dimming during the 2015 April 28th filament
eruption. After the filament started to erupt, two flare ribbons formed, one of
which had a well-visible hook enclosing a core (twin) dimming region. Along
multiple funnels located in this dimming, a motion of plasma directed outwards
started to be visible in the 171 and 193 filter channels of the instrument. In
time-distance diagrams, this motion generated a strip-like pattern, which
lasted for more than five hours and which characteristics did not change along
the funnel. We therefore suggest the motion to be a signature of outflows
corresponding to velocities ranging between $\approx70$ and 140 km s$^{-1}$.
Interestingly, the pattern of the outflows as well as their velocities were
found to be similar to those we observed in a neighboring ordinary coronal
hole. Therefore, the outflows were most likely a signature of a CME-induced
slow solar wind flowing along the open-field structures rooted in the dimming
region. Further, the evolution of the hook encircling the dimming region was
examined in the context of the latest predictions imposed for the
three-dimensional magnetic reconnection. The observations indicate that the
filament's footpoints were, during their transformation to the dimming region,
reconnecting with surrounding canopies. To our knowledge, our observations
present the first imaging evidence for outflows of plasma from a dimming

solution of the INLS equation with finite maximal time of existence
$T^{\ast}>0$, then $\limsup_{t\rightarrow T^{\ast}}\|u(t)\|_{\dot

and interference can enhance energy transfer in a nontrivial way, focusing on
an example of a donor-bridge-acceptor trimeric chromophore system coupled to
two vibrational degrees of freedom. Employing parameters selected to provide an
overall uphill energy transfer from donor to acceptor, we use numerical
calculations of dynamics in a coupled exciton-vibration basis, together with
perturbation-based analytics and calculation of vibronic spectra, we identify
clear spectral features of single- and multi-phonon vibrationally-assisted
energy transfer (VAET) dynamics, where the latter include up to six-phonon
contributions. We identify signatures of vibrational cooperation and
interference that provide enhancement of energy transfer relative to that
obtained from VAET with a single vibrational mode. We observe a phononic
analogue of two-photon absorption, as well as a novel heteroexcitation
mechanism in which a single phonon gives rise to simultaneous excitation of
both the trimeric system and the vibrational degrees of freedom. The impact of
vibrations and of the one- and two-phonon VAET processes on the energy transfer
are seen to be quite different in the weak and strong site-vibration coupling
regimes. In the weak coupling regime, two-phonon processes dominate, whereas in
the strong coupling regime up to six-phonon VAET processes can be induced. The
VAET features are seen to be enhanced with increasing temperature and
site-vibration coupling strength, and are reduced in the presence of
dissipation. We analyze the dependence of these phenomena on the explicit form
of the chromophore-vibration couplings, with comparison of VAET spectra for
local and non-local couplings.

cognition would benefit from whole-brain analyses. Here, we quantify
whole-brain activity while participants listen to a variety of music and speech
auditory pieces using two network measures that are grounded in complex systems
theory: modularity, which measures the degree to which brain regions are
interacting in communities, and flexibility, which measures the rate that brain
regions switch the communities to which they belong. In a music and brain
connectivity study that is part of a larger clinical investigation into music
listening and stroke recovery, fMRI was performed on healthy participants while
they listened to self-selected music to which they felt a positive emotional
attachment, as well as culturally familiar music (J.S. Bach), culturally
unfamiliar music (Gagaku court music of medieval Japan), and several excerpts
of speech. There was a marked contrast among the whole-brain networks during
the different types of auditory pieces, in particular for the unfamiliar music.
During the self-selected and Bach tracks, participants' whole-brain networks
exhibited modular organization that was significantly coordinated with the
network flexibility. Meanwhile, when the Gagaku music was played, this
relationship between brain network modularity and flexibility largely
disappeared. In addition, while the auditory cortex's flexibility during the
self-selected piece was equivalent to that during Bach, it was more flexible
during Gagaku. The results suggest that the modularity and flexibility measures
of whole-brain activity have the potential to lead to new insights into the
complex neural function that occurs during music perception of real-world
songs.

This work describes an investigation of the morphological changes SiO2/Ta2O5

results in a reduction of internal friction in both nanolaminates, but through
different pathways. In the SiO2/Ta2O5 nanolaminate, which layers remain intact
after annealing, the total reduction in internal friction follows the reduction
in the composing SiO2 and Ta2O5 layers. Instead, interdiffusion initiated by
annealing at the interface of the TiO2/Ta2O5 nanolaminate and the formation of
a mixed phase dictate a more significant reduction in internal friction to ~
2.6 * 10-4, a value lower than any other Ta2O5 mixture coating with similar

partial observations using a point set representation for a 3D shape. Previous
approaches propose neural networks to directly estimate the whole point cloud
through encoder-decoder models fed by the incomplete point set. By predicting
the complete model, the current methods compute redundant information because
the output also contains the known incomplete input geometry. This paper
proposes an end-to-end neural network architecture that focuses on computing
the missing geometry and merging the known input and the predicted point cloud.
Our method is composed of two neural networks: the missing part prediction
network and the merging-refinement network. The first module focuses on
extracting information from the incomplete input to infer the missing geometry.
The second module merges both point clouds and improves the distribution of the
points. Our experiments on ShapeNet dataset show that our method outperforms
the state-of-the-art methods in point cloud completion. The code of our methods

that iterations of detecting and addressing the issues unearthed by our method

introduce a new Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise (KLJN) secure key exchanger that
operates with 4 arbitrary resistors (instead of 2 arbitrary resistance values
forming 2 identical resistor pairs in the original system). They state that in
this new, VMG-KLJN, non-equilibrium system with nonzero power flow, the
security during the exchange of the two (HL and LH) bit values is as strong as
in the original KLJN scheme. Moreover, they claim that, at practical
conditions, their VMG-KLJN protocol ""supports more robust protection against
attacks"". First, we investigate the power flow and thermal equilibrium issues
of the VMG-KLJN system with 4 arbitrary resistors. Then we introduce a new KLJN
protocol that allows the arbitrary choice of 3 resistors from the 4, while it
still operates with zero power flow during the exchange of single bits by
utilizing a specific value of the 4th resistor and a binary temperature set for
the exchanged (HL and LH) bit values. Then we show that, in general, the KLJN
schemes with more than 2 arbitrary resistors (including our new protocol
mentioned above) are prone to 4 new passive attacks utilizing the parasitic
capacitance and inductance in the cable, while the original KLJN scheme is
naturally immune against these new attacks. The core of the security
vulnerability exploited by these attacks is the different line resistances in
the HL and LH cases. Therefore, on the contrary of the statement and claim
cited above, the practical VMG-KLJN system is less secure than the original
KLJN scheme. We introduce another 2, modified, non-equilibrium KLJN systems to
eliminate the vulnerability against some - but not all - of these attacks.
However the price for that is the loss of arbitrariness of the selection of the
4th resistor and the information leak still remains greater than zero.

preferred fault explanations. Existing algorithms that are sound (i.e., output
only actual fault explanations) and complete (i.e., can return all
explanations), however, require exponential space to achieve this task. As a
remedy, we propose two novel diagnostic search algorithms, called RBF-HS
(Recursive Best-First Hitting Set Search) and HBF-HS (Hybrid Best-First Hitting
Set Search), which build upon tried and tested techniques from the heuristic
search domain. RBF-HS can enumerate an arbitrary predefined finite number of
fault explanations in best-first order within linear space bounds, without
sacrificing the desirable soundness or completeness properties. The idea of
HBF-HS is to find a trade-off between runtime optimization and a restricted
space consumption that does not exceed the available memory.
  In extensive experiments on real-world diagnosis cases we compared our
approaches to Reiter's HS-Tree, a state-of-the-art method that gives the same
theoretical guarantees and is as general(ly applicable) as the suggested
algorithms. For the computation of minimum-cardinality fault explanations, we
find that (1) RBF-HS reduces memory requirements substantially in most cases by
up to several orders of magnitude, (2) in more than a third of the cases, both
memory savings and runtime savings are achieved, and (3) given the runtime
overhead is significant, using HBF-HS instead of RBF-HS reduces the runtime to
values comparable with HS-Tree while keeping the used memory reasonably
bounded. When computing most probable fault explanations, we observe that
RBF-HS tends to trade memory savings more or less one-to-one for runtime
overheads. Again, HBF-HS proves to be a reasonable remedy to cut down the
runtime while complying with practicable memory bounds.

topological insulator with a small band gap of $\sim$25 meV, consistent with
angle-resolved photoemission (ARPES) experiments. However, the gap is closed in
the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in the photoinduced transient
state, where massless Dirac fermions emerge in the chiral band structure. The
time scale of the relaxation dynamics to the transient Dirac semimetal state is
remarkably long, $\tau \sim$160 ps, which is two orders of magnitude longer

correspond to smaller fully-connected layers to replace the original embedding

the rows of $A_j$ represent their projections onto the $j$-dimensional subspace

practice, these rows of $A$ may be spread around $k>1$ subspaces, so factoring
$A$ based on a single subspace may lead to large errors that turn into large
drops in accuracy.
  Inspired by \emph{projective clustering} from computational geometry, we
suggest replacing this subspace by a set of $k$ subspaces, each of dimension
$j$, that minimizes the sum of squared distances over every point (row in $A$)

  Extensive experimental results on the GLUE benchmark yield networks that are
both more accurate and smaller compared to the standard matrix factorization
(SVD). For example, we further compress DistilBERT by reducing the size of the
embedding layer by $40\%$ while incurring only a $0.5\%$ average drop in
accuracy over all nine GLUE tasks, compared to a $2.8\%$ drop using the
existing SVD approach. On RoBERTa we achieve $43\%$ compression of the

only changes in appearance or object mass). Further, this common
parametrization facilitates defining curricula by interpolating between an
initial and a target task. While users may define their own task distributions,
we present eight meaningful distributions as concrete benchmarks, ranging from
simple to very challenging, all of which require long-horizon planning as well

built to greatly improve the ATLAS trigger system capabilities for identifying
interesting physics processes through track-based signatures. The FTK is
reconstructing after each Level-1 trigger all tracks with $ p_{\textrm T}>1 $
GeV, such that the high-level trigger system gains access to track information

constraints, a base station (BS) is able to listen to only one multiplexing

fast Fourier transform (FFT) at a very small sampling interval over the
multiplexing bands in order to counter the uncertainty of IoT device frequency
and synchronize onto transmissions. The objective is to find an assignment of
BSs to multiplexing bands in order to maximize the packet decoding probability

PDP maximization. The simulation results show that our approach to band
assignment achieves near-optimal performance in terms of PDP, while at the same

prediction of the agents' future paths to know if they will collide at any
time. One straightforward system would use known-location static anchors to
estimate agent coordinates over time, and use the track to predict collision.
Fundamentally, no fixed coordinate system is required for collision prediction,
so using only the pairwise range between two agents can be used to predict
collision. We present lower bound analysis which shows the limitations of this
pairwise method. As an alternative anchor-free method, we propose the
friend-based autonomous collision prediction and tracking (FACT) method that
uses all measured ranges between nearby (unknown location mobile) agents, in a

show the potential for FACT to achieve equal or better collision detection

then build a network of $N$ ultra wideband (UWB) devices and an efficient

  As applications, we construct a monopole Floer 2-functor and the generalized
cobordism maps. Using results of Kronheimer-Mrowka and Ni, it is shown that for
any such 3-manifold $Y$ that is irreducible, this Floer homology detects the
Thurston norm on $H_2(Y,\partial Y;\mathbb{R})$ and the fiberness of $Y$.
Finally, we show that our construction recovers the monopole link Floer

the connected and automated vehicle technology, we propose the rhythmic control
(RC) scheme that allows vehicles to pass through an intersection in a
conflict-free manner with a preset rhythm. The rhythm enables vehicles to
proceed at a constant speed without any stop. The RC is capable of breaking the
limitation that right of way can only be allocated to non-conflicting movements
at a time. It significantly improves the performance of intersection control
for automated traffic. Moreover, the RC with a predetermined rhythm does not
require intensive computational efforts to dynamically control vehicles, which
may possibly lead to frequent accelerations or decelerations. Assuming
stationary vehicle arrivals, we conduct theoretical investigation to show that
RC can considerably increase intersection capacity and reduce vehicle delay.
Finally, the performance of RC is tested in the simulations with both

in non-centrosymmetric molecules are often assumed to reach the same excited
state and, hence, to produce similar excited-state reactivity. We compare the
solvent-to-solute excited-state proton transfer of the super photobase FR0-SB
following isoenergetic OPE and TPE. We find up to 62 % increased reactivity
following TPE compared to OPE. From steady-state spectroscopy, we rule out the
involvement of different excited states and find that OPE and TPE spectra are
identical in non-polar solvents but not in polar ones. We propose that
differences in the matrix elements that contribute to the two-photon absorption
cross sections lead to the observed enhanced isoenergetic reactivity,
consistent with the predictions of our high-level coupled-cluster-based
computational protocol. We find that polar solvent configurations favor greater
dipole moment change between ground and excited states, which enters the
probability for two-photon excitations as the absolute value squared. This, in
turn, causes a difference in the Franck-Condon region reached via TPE compared
to OPE. We conclude that a new method has been found for controlling chemical
reactivity via the matrix elements that affect two-photon cross sections, which
may be of great utility for spatial and temporal precision chemistry.

noisy layer is the common crux of a classical category of tasks on image
restoration such as image reflection removal, image deraining and image
dehazing. These tasks are typically formulated and tackled individually due to
the diverse and complicated appearance patterns of noise layers within the
image. In this work we present the Deep-Masking Generative Network (DMGN),
which is a unified framework for background restoration from the superimposed
images and is able to cope with different types of noise. Our proposed DMGN
follows a coarse-to-fine generative process: a coarse background image and a
noise image are first generated in parallel, then the noise image is further
leveraged to refine the background image to achieve a higher-quality background
image. In particular, we design the novel Residual Deep-Masking Cell as the
core operating unit for our DMGN to enhance the effective information and
suppress the negative information during image generation via learning a gating
mask to control the information flow. By iteratively employing this Residual
Deep-Masking Cell, our proposed DMGN is able to generate both high-quality
background image and noisy image progressively. Furthermore, we propose a
two-pronged strategy to effectively leverage the generated noise image as
contrasting cues to facilitate the refinement of the background image.
Extensive experiments across three typical tasks for image background
restoration, including image reflection removal, image rain steak removal and
image dehazing, show that our DMGN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
methods specifically designed for each single task.

generate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based
attack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of
these algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)
iteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast
moving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally
without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,
this paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world
road sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)
we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip
those zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural
perturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a
single perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance
of the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function
that can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real
world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the
attack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a
quarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also
provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.

candidate for reducing test-mass thermal noise in ground-based
gravitational-wave detectors like Advanced LIGO. It has been shown however that
LG modes' fragility against mirror surface figure imperfections limits their
compatibility with the current state-of-the-art test masses. In this paper we
explore the alternative of using higher-order Hermite-Gauss (HG) modes for
thermal noise reduction, and show that with the deliberate addition of
astigmatism they are orders of magnitude more robust against mirror surface
distortions than LG modes of equivalent order. We present simulations of
Advanced LIGO-like arm cavities with realistic mirror figures which can support
HG$_{33}$ modes with average arm losses and contrast defects in a Fabry-Perot
Michelson interferometer configuration which are well below the typical
measured values in Advanced LIGO. This demonstrates that the mirror surface
flatness errors will not be a limiting factor for the use of these modes in
future gravitational-wave detectors.

strategy to set the hyperparameter values. We propose a new method for
hyperparameter optimization based on genetic algorithms (GAs). We compare six
different GA variants and explore different choices for the GA-optimized
fitness score. We show that the GA can discover high-quality architectures when
the initial hyperparameter seed values are far from a good solution as well as
refining already good networks. For example, when starting from the
architecture proposed by George and Huerta, the network optimized over the
20-dimensional hyperparameter space has 78% fewer trainable parameters while
obtaining an 11% increase in accuracy for our test problem. Using genetic
algorithm optimization to refine an existing network should be especially
useful if the problem context (e.g. statistical properties of the noise, signal
model, etc) changes and one needs to rebuild a network. In all of our
experiments, we find the GA discovers significantly less complicated networks
as compared to the seed network, suggesting it can be used to prune wasteful
network structures. While we have restricted our attention to CNN classifiers,
our GA hyperparameter optimization strategy can be applied within other machine

rupture front, analogous to a shear crack. The rupture front nucleates
quasi-statically in a localized region of the frictional interface and slowly
increases in size. When it reaches a critical nucleation length it becomes
unstable, propagates dynamically and eventually breaks the entire interface,
leading to macroscopic sliding. The nucleation process is particularly
important because it determines the stress level at which the frictional
interface fails, and therefore, the macroscopic friction strength. However, the
mechanisms governing nucleation of frictional rupture fronts are still not well
understood. Specifically, our knowledge of the nucleation process along a
heterogeneous interface remains incomplete. Here, we study the nucleation of
localized slip patches on linear slip-weakening interfaces with deterministic
and stochastic heterogeneous friction properties. Using numerical simulations,
we analyze the process leading to a slip patch of critical size for systems
with varying correlation lengths of the local friction strength. Our
deterministic interface model reveals that the growth of the critical
nucleation patch at interfaces with small correlation lengths is non smooth due
to the coalescence of neighboring slip patches. Existing analytical solutions
do not account for this effect, which leads to an overestimation of global
interface strength. Conversely, when the correlation length is large, the
growth of the slip patch is continuous and our simulations match the analytical
solution. Furthermore, nucleation by coalescence is also observed on stochastic
interfaces with small correlation length...

results in model inefficiencies in parameter usage: an entirely new model is

capture the representation of the language in conversation style with the

employs a concatenated coding framework with an inner AMP decoder followed by
an outer tree decoder. In their original implementation, these two components
work independently of each other, with the tree decoder acting on the static
output of the AMP decoder. This article introduces a novel framework where the
inner AMP decoder and the outer tree decoder operate in tandem, dynamically

tokens appear with different frequencies, which leads to different learning
difficulties for tokens in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). The vanilla NMT
model usually adopts trivial equal-weighted objectives for target tokens with
different frequencies and tends to generate more high-frequency tokens and less
low-frequency tokens compared with the golden token distribution. However,
low-frequency tokens may carry critical semantic information that will affect
the translation quality once they are neglected. In this paper, we explored
target token-level adaptive objectives based on token frequencies to assign
appropriate weights for each target token during training. We aimed that those
meaningful but relatively low-frequency words could be assigned with larger
weights in objectives to encourage the model to pay more attention to these
tokens. Our method yields consistent improvements in translation quality on
ZH-EN, EN-RO, and EN-DE translation tasks, especially on sentences that contain
more low-frequency tokens where we can get 1.68, 1.02, and 0.52 BLEU increases
compared with baseline, respectively. Further analyses show that our method can
also improve the lexical diversity of translation.

  Findings: The application of NLPCONTRIBUTIONGRAPH on the 50 articles resulted
finally in a dataset of 900 contribution-focused sentences, 4,702

The framework is implemented in an implicit time integration scheme, with both

resistance curves (R-curves). We show that the model is able to capture the

associated with stress-induced phase transformation. Insight is gained into the
role of temperature, material strength, crack density function and fracture
energy homogenisation. Secondly, several 2D and 3D boundary value problems are
addressed, demonstrating the capabilities of the model in capturing complex
cracking phenomena in SMAs, such as unstable crack growth, mixed-mode fracture

nature when members of different social groups have unequal access to this
feature. Our framework finds a natural application to recent policy debates on
dropping standardized testing in college admissions.
  Our primary takeaway is that the decision to drop a feature (such as test
scores) cannot be made without the joint context of the information provided by
other features and how the requirement affects the applicant pool composition.
Dropping a feature may exacerbate disparities by decreasing the amount of
information available for each applicant, especially those from non-traditional
backgrounds. However, in the presence of access barriers to a feature, the
interaction between the informational environment and the effect of access
barriers on the applicant pool size becomes highly complex. In this case, we
provide a threshold characterization regarding when removing a feature improves
both academic merit and diversity. Finally, using application and transcript
data from the University of Texas at Austin, we illustrate that there exist
practical settings where dropping standardized testing improves or worsens all

wave path was neglected making the speed estimation unreliable. High volume
rate transthoracic acquisitions of the human left ventricle (1100 volume/s) was
performed with a 4D ultrafast echocardiographic scanner. Four-dimensional
tissue velocity cineloops enabled visualization of aortic and mitral valve
closure waves. Energy and time of flight mapping allowed propagation path
visualization and source localization, respectively. Velocities were quantified
along different directions. Aortic and mitral valve closure SW velocities were
assessed for the three volunteers with low standard deviation. Anisotropic
propagation was also found suggesting the necessity of using a
three-dimensional imaging approach. Different velocities were estimated for the
three directions for the aortic (3.4$\pm$0.1 m/s, 3.5$\pm$0.3 m/s, 5.4$\pm$0.7

a comprehensive measurement of cardiac stiffness. This technique could provide

  processes with long memory operators",,,,,"math.FA math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Fractionally integrated autoregressive moving average (FIARMA) processes have
been widely and successfully used to model and predict univariate time series
exhibiting long range dependence. Vector and functional extensions of these
processes have also been considered more recently. Here we study these
processes by relying on a spectral domain approach in the case where the
processes are valued in a separable Hilbert space H0. In this framework, the
usual univariate long memory parameter d is replaced by a long memory operator
D acting on H0, leading to a class of H0-valued FIARMA(D, p, q) processes,
where p and q are the degrees of the AR and MA polynomials. When D is a normal
operator, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the D-fractional
integration of an H0-valued ARMA(p, q) process to be well defined. Then, we
derive the best predictor for a class of causal FIARMA processes and study how
this best predictor can be consistently estimated from a finite sample of the
process. To this end, we provide a general result on quadratic functionals of
the periodogram, which incidentally yields a result of independent interest.
Namely, for any ergodic stationary process valued in H0 with finite second
moment, the empirical autocovariance operator converges, in trace-norm, to the
true autocovariance operator almost surely at each lag.

application of reinforcement learning to create a financial model-free solution

models based on multilayer perceptrons for simple image recognition to much
deeper and more complex neural networks for self-driving vehicle control
systems.The rapid increase in the consumption of memory and computational
resources by these models demands the use of multi-core parallel systems to
scale the execution of the complex emerging applications that depend on them.
However, parallel programs running on high-performance computers often suffer
from data communication bottlenecks, limited memory bandwidth, and
synchronization overhead due to irregular critical sections. In this paper, we
propose a framework to reduce the data communication and improve the
scalability and performance of these applications in multi-core systems. We
design a vertex cut framework for partitioning LLVM IR graphs into clusters
while taking into consideration the data communication and workload balance
among clusters. First, we construct LLVM graphs by compiling high-level
programs into LLVM IR, instrumenting code to obtain the execution order of
basic blocks and the execution time for each memory operation, and analyze data
dependencies in dynamic LLVM traces. Next, we formulate the problem as Weight
Balanced $p$-way Vertex Cut, and propose a generic and flexible framework,
wherein four different greedy algorithms are proposed for solving this problem.
Lastly, we propose a memory-centric run-time mapping of the linear time
complexity to map clusters generated from the vertex cut algorithms onto a
multi-core platform. We conclude that our best algorithm, WB-Libra, provides
performance improvements of 1.56x and 1.86x over existing state-of-the-art

Letter{\textit{}}, we demonstrate the extreme case: close binaries of
supermassive black holes (CB-SMBHs) with high eccentricities are able to
trigger the CL transition through one orbit. In this scenario, binary black
holes build up their own mini-disks by peeling gas off the inner edges of the
circumbinary disk during the apastron phase, after which they tidally interact
with the disks during the periastron phase to efficiently exchange angular
momentum within one orbital period. For mini-disks rotating retrograde to the
orbit, the tidal torque rapidly squeezes the tidal parts of the mini-disks into
a much smaller radius, which rapidly results in higher accretion and short
flares before the disks decline into type-2 AGNs. Prograde-rotation mini-disks
gain angular momentum from the binary and rotate outward, which causes a rapid
turn-off from type-1 to type-2. Turn-on occurs around the apastron phase.
CB-SMBHs control cycle transitions between type-1 and type-2 with orbital
periods but allow diverse properties in CL-AGN light curves.

and a distortion constant D0=0.511 +/- 0.005 kHz towards the cold dense core
TMC-1. High-level-of-theory ab initio calculations indicate that the best
possible candidate is protonated tricarbon monoxide, HC3O+. We have succeeded
in producing this species in the laboratory and observed its J = 2-1 and 3-2
rotational transitions. Hence, we report the discovery of HC3O+ in space based
on our observations, theoretical calculations, and laboratory experiments. We
derive an abundance ratio N(C3O)/N(HC3O+) = 7. The high abundance of the
protonated form of C3O is due to the high proton affinity of the neutral
species. The chemistry of O-bearing species is modelled, and predictions are
compared to the derived abundances from our data for the most prominent
O-bearing species in TMC-1.

The detector cannot obtain sufficient context semantic information due to the
relatively long distance. The received poor fine-grained features make the face
detection less accurate and robust. To solve the problem of long-distance
detection of tiny faces, we propose an enhanced network model (YOLOv3-C) based
on the YOLOv3 algorithm for unmanned platform. In this model, we bring in
multi-scale features from feature pyramid networks and make the features
fu-sion to adjust prediction feature map of the output, which improves the
sensitivity of the entire algorithm for tiny target faces. The enhanced model
improves the accuracy of tiny face detection in the cases of long-distance and
high-density crowds. The experimental evaluation results demonstrated the
superior perfor-mance of the proposed YOLOv3-C in comparison with other

Furthermore, applying the structural coherence of epitaxial crystals with
substrate, scalable perovskite single-crystalline thin films have been obtained
and can be transferred onto arbitrary substrates. Substrate engineering also
can stabilize the desired perovskite phases by modulating the strain between
crystals and substrates. Finally, several key challenges and related solutions

of $n$ autonomous, mobile robots in the Euclidean plane: Is it possible to
solve Gathering of robots that do not agree on any axis of their coordinate
systems (disoriented robots) and see other robots only up to a constant
distance (limited visibility) in $o(n^2)$ fully synchronous rounds? The best
known algorithm that solves Gathering of disoriented robots with limited
visibility assuming oblivious robots needs $\Theta(n^2)$ rounds [SPAA'11]. The
lower bound for this algorithm even holds in a simplified closed chain model,
where each robot has exactly two neighbors and the chain connections form a
cycle. The only existing algorithms achieving a linear number of rounds for
disoriented robots assume robots that are located on a two dimensional grid
[IPDPS'16] and [SPAA'16]. Both algorithms make use of locally visible lights
(the LUMINOUS model).
  In this work, we show for the closed chain model, that $n$ disoriented robots
with limited visibility in the Euclidean plane can be gathered in
$\Theta\left(n\right)$ rounds assuming the LUMINOUS model. The lights are used
to initiate and perform so-called runs along the chain. For the start of such
runs, locally unique robots need to be determined. In contrast to the grid
[IPDPS'16], this is not possible in every configuration in the Euclidean plane.
Based on the theory of isogonal polygons by Gr\""unbaum, we identify the class
of isogonal configurations in which no such locally unique robots can be
identified. Our solution combines two algorithms: The first one gathers
isogonal configurations; it works without any lights. The second one works for
non-isogonal configurations; it identifies locally unique robots to start runs,
using a constant number of lights. Interleaving these algorithms solves the
Gathering problem in $\mathcal{O}(n)$ rounds.

and biologically-inspired learning principles than those in standard Artificial
Neural Networks (ANNs). SNNs are considered the third generation of ANNs,
powerful on the robust computation with a low computational cost. The neurons
in SNNs are non-differential, containing decayed historical states and
generating event-based spikes after their states reaching the firing threshold.
These dynamic characteristics of SNNs make it difficult to be directly trained
with the standard backpropagation (BP), which is also considered not
biologically plausible. In this paper, a Biologically-plausible Reward
Propagation (BRP) algorithm is proposed and applied to the SNN architecture
with both spiking-convolution (with both 1D and 2D convolutional kernels) and
full-connection layers. Unlike the standard BP that propagates error signals
from post to presynaptic neurons layer by layer, the BRP propagates target
labels instead of errors directly from the output layer to all pre-hidden
layers. This effort is more consistent with the top-down reward-guiding
learning in cortical columns of the neocortex. Synaptic modifications with only
local gradient differences are induced with pseudo-BP that might also be
replaced with the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). The performance of
the proposed BRP-SNN is further verified on the spatial (including MNIST and
Cifar-10) and temporal (including TIDigits and DvsGesture) tasks, where the SNN
using BRP has reached a similar accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art
BP-based SNNs and saved 50% more computational cost than ANNs. We think the
introduction of biologically plausible learning rules to the training procedure
of biologically realistic SNNs will give us more hints and inspirations toward
a better understanding of the biological system's intelligent nature.

pixelated LSO in which a triangular optical window allows light sharing between

marginalizes over all possible factorizations within and across all channels.
MGLM endows flexible inference, including unconditional generation, conditional
generation (where 1 channel is observed and other channels are generated), and
partially observed generation (where incomplete observations are spread across
all the channels). We experiment with the Multi30K dataset containing English,
French, Czech, and German. We demonstrate experiments with unconditional,
conditional, and partially conditional generation. We provide qualitative
samples sampled unconditionally from the generative joint distribution. We also
quantitatively analyze the quality-diversity trade-offs and find MGLM
outperforms traditional bilingual discriminative models.

categories: indirect and direct. Indirect methods are more sensitive to planets
with a small orbital period, whereas direct detection is more sensitive to
planets orbiting at a large distance from their host star. %, and thus on long
orbital period. This dichotomy makes it difficult to combine the two techniques
on a single target at once. Simultaneous measurements made by direct and
indirect techniques offer the possibility of determining the mass and
luminosity of planets and a method of testing formation models. Here, we aim to
show how long-baseline interferometric observations guided by radial-velocity
can be used in such a way. We observed the recently-discovered giant planet
$\beta$ Pictoris c with GRAVITY, mounted on the Very Large Telescope
Interferometer (VLTI). This study constitutes the first direct confirmation of
a planet discovered through radial velocity. We find that the planet has a
temperature of $T = 1250\pm50$\,K and a dynamical mass of $M =
8.2\pm0.8\,M_{\rm Jup}$. At $18.5\pm2.5$\,Myr, this puts $\beta$ Pic c close to
a 'hot start' track, which is usually associated with formation via disk
instability. Conversely, the planet orbits at a distance of 2.7\,au, which is
too close for disk instability to occur. The low apparent magnitude ($M_{\rm K}
= 14.3 \pm 0.1$) favours a core accretion scenario. We suggest that this
apparent contradiction is a sign of hot core accretion, for example, due to the
mass of the planetary core or the existence of a high-temperature accretion
shock during formation.

ignoring the interaction between them when generating embedded representations.
In this work, we establish the theoretical foundations for the validity of
training a reinforcement learning agent using embedded states and actions. We
then propose a new approach for jointly learning embeddings for states and
actions that combines aspects of model-free and model-based reinforcement
learning, which can be applied in both discrete and continuous domains.
Specifically, we use a model of the environment to obtain embeddings for states
and actions and present a generic architecture that leverages these to learn a
policy. In this way, the embedded representations obtained via our approach
enable better generalization over both states and actions by capturing
similarities in the embedding spaces. Evaluations of our approach on several
gaming, robotic control, and recommender systems show it significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art models in both discrete/continuous domains with
large state/action spaces, thus confirming its efficacy.

message-passing concurrent and distributed systems, based on the theory of
multiparty session types (MPST). Understanding the run-time performance of
concurrent and distributed systems is of great importance for the
identification of bottlenecks and optimisation opportunities. In the
message-passing setting, these bottlenecks are generally communication
overheads and synchronisation times. Despite its importance, reasoning about
these intensional properties of software, such as performance, has received
little attention, compared to verifying extensional properties, such as
correctness. Behavioural protocol specifications based on sessions types
capture not only extensional, but also intensional properties of concurrent and
distributed systems. CAMP augments MPST with annotations of communication
latency and local computation cost, defined as estimated execution times, that
we use to extract cost equations from protocol descriptions. CAMP is also
extendable to analyse asynchronous communication optimisation built on a recent
advance of session type theories. We apply our tool to different existing
benchmarks and use cases in the literature with a wide range of communication
protocols, implemented in C, MPI-C, Scala, Go, and OCaml. Our benchmarks show
that, in most of the cases, we predict an upper-bound on the real execution

include features such as segmented primary mirrors, secondary mirrors, and

in combining coronagraphy and wavefront shaping to reduce starlight at small

exoplanet signal. We aim to study the limitations of this combination when
observing short-orbit planets. Our analysis is focused on SPEED, the Nice test

knowledge of their dynamics is available is a prevalent problem across various
scientific fields. While purely data-driven approaches are arguably
insufficient in this context, standard physical modeling based approaches tend
to be over-simplistic, inducing non-negligible errors. In this work, we
introduce the APHYNITY framework, a principled approach for augmenting
incomplete physical dynamics described by differential equations with deep
data-driven models. It consists in decomposing the dynamics into two
components: a physical component accounting for the dynamics for which we have
some prior knowledge, and a data-driven component accounting for errors of the
physical model. The learning problem is carefully formulated such that the
physical model explains as much of the data as possible, while the data-driven
component only describes information that cannot be captured by the physical
model, no more, no less. This not only provides the existence and uniqueness
for this decomposition, but also ensures interpretability and benefits
generalization. Experiments made on three important use cases, each
representative of a different family of phenomena, i.e. reaction-diffusion
equations, wave equations and the non-linear damped pendulum, show that
APHYNITY can efficiently leverage approximate physical models to accurately
forecast the evolution of the system and correctly identify relevant physical
parameters. Code is available at https://github.com/yuan-yin/APHYNITY .

(depending only on the legitimate receiver, depending only the eavesdropper,
and depending on both legitimate receiver and eavesdropper) in quantum key
distribution (QKD) systems over free-space optical links. To be more realistic,
we consider a generalized pointing error scenario, where the azimuth and
elevation pointing error angles caused by stochastic jitters and vibrations in
the legitimate receiver platform are independently distributed according to a
non-identical normal distribution. Taking these assumptions into account, we
derive approximate expressions of transmission probabilities by using the
Gaussian quadrature method. To simplify the expressions and get some physical
insights, some asymptotic analysis on the transmission probabilities is
presented based on asymptotic expression for the generalized Marcum Q-function
when the telescope gain at the legitimate receiver approaches to infinity.
Moreover, from the asymptotic expression for the generalized Marcum Q-function,
the asymptotic outage probability over Beckmann fading channels (a general
channel model including Rayleigh, Rice, and Hoyt fading channels) can be also
easily derived when the average signal-to-noise ratio is sufficiently large,
which shows the diversity order and array gain.

A crucial topic in Italian politics, it has recently been a focus of several

in terms of geography and demographics (age and gender). For instance, Five

descriptions for source code, is a crucial task in the field of automatic
software development. Traditional comment generation methods use
manually-crafted templates or information retrieval (IR) techniques to generate
summaries for source code. In recent years, neural network-based methods which
leveraged acclaimed encoder-decoder deep learning framework to learn comment
generation patterns from a large-scale parallel code corpus, have achieved
impressive results. However, these emerging methods only take code-related
information as input. Software reuse is common in the process of software
development, meaning that comments of similar code snippets are helpful for
comment generation. Inspired by the IR-based and template-based approaches, in
this paper, we propose a neural comment generation approach where we use the
existing comments of similar code snippets as exemplars to guide comment
generation. Specifically, given a piece of code, we first use an IR technique
to retrieve a similar code snippet and treat its comment as an exemplar. Then
we design a novel seq2seq neural network that takes the given code, its AST,
its similar code, and its exemplar as input, and leverages the information from
the exemplar to assist in the target comment generation based on the semantic
similarity between the source code and the similar code. We evaluate our
approach on a large-scale Java corpus, which contains about 2M samples, and
experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by a substantial margin.

averaging the kernel over all possible subsets of the original sample, they

geometry. Examples are the maximal perimeters and areas of polygons and
polyhedra formed by random points on a circle, ellipse, etc. The main method to
study limit theorems for U-max statistics is a Poisson approximation. In this

a universal limit theorem with the Weibull distribution as a limit. Its
parameters depend on the degree of the kernel, the structure of its points of
maximum and the Hessians of the kernel at these points. Almost all limit
theorems known so far may be obtained as simple special cases of our general

formulae involving stellar parameters of nonrotating NSs. Using these relations
we compute which constraints on NS radii and the tidal deformability are set by
current and future merger detections revealing information about the merger
product. We systematically investigate the impact of the binary mass ratio
q=M_1/M_2 and assemble different fits, which make different assumptions about
a-priori knowlegde. We find fit formulae for M_thr including an explicit q
dependence, which are valid in a broad range of 0.7<=q<=1 and which are nearly
as tight as relations for fixed mass ratios. For most EoS models except extreme
cases M_thr of asymmetric mergers is equal or smaller than the one of
equal-mass binaries. The impact of the binary mass asymmetry on M_thr becomes
stronger with more extreme mass ratios, while M_thr is approximately constant
for small deviations from q=1. We describe that a phase transition to
deconfined quark matter can leave a characteristic imprint on the collapse
behavior. The presence of quark matter can reduce the stability of the remnant
and thus M_thr relative to a purely hadronic reference model. Comparing the
threshold mass and the tidal deformability Lambda_thr of a system with M_thr
can yield peculiar combinations of those two quantities, where M_thr is
particularly small in relation to Lambda_thr. Hence, a combined measurement of
both quantities can indicate the onset of quark deconfinement. We point out new
univariate relations between M_thr and stellar properties of high-mass NSs,
which can be employed for direct EoS constraints or consistency checks.

motor skills, which allows them to interact with the world immediately after
birth. At the same time, many behaviors are highly adaptive and can be tailored
to specific environments by means of learning. In this work, we use
mathematical analysis and the framework of meta-learning (or 'learning to
learn') to answer when it is beneficial to learn such an adaptive strategy and
when to hard-code a heuristic behavior. We find that the interplay of
ecological uncertainty, task complexity and the agents' lifetime has crucial
effects on the meta-learned amortized Bayesian inference performed by an agent.
There exist two regimes: One in which meta-learning yields a learning algorithm
that implements task-dependent information-integration and a second regime in
which meta-learning imprints a heuristic or 'hard-coded' behavior. Further
analysis reveals that non-adaptive behaviors are not only optimal for aspects
of the environment that are stable across individuals, but also in situations
where an adaptation to the environment would in fact be highly beneficial, but
could not be done quickly enough to be exploited within the remaining lifetime.
Hard-coded behaviors should hence not only be those that always work, but also
those that are too complex to be learned within a reasonable time frame.

declarative approaches facilitate modularity and automated,
analysis-independent optimizations, imperative approaches foster manual,
analysis-specific optimizations.
  In this paper, we present a novel approach to static analyses that leverages
the modularity of blackboard systems and combines declarative and imperative
techniques. Our approach allows exchangeability, and pluggable extension of
analyses in order to improve sound(i)ness, precision, and scalability and
explicitly enables the combination of otherwise incompatible analyses. With our
approach integrated in the OPAL framework, we were able to implement various
dissimilar analyses, including a points-to analysis that outperforms an
equivalent analysis from Doop, the state-of-the-art points-to analysis
framework.

the form of the BenDaniel--Duke kinetic energy operator. The
position-dependency of the mass and the angular frequency is such that the
homogeneous nature of the harmonic oscillator force constant $k$ and hence the
regular harmonic oscillator potential is preserved. As a consequence thereof, a
quantization of the confinement parameter is observed. It is shown that the
discrete energy spectrum of the confined harmonic oscillator with
position-dependent mass and angular frequency is finite, has a non-equidistant
form and depends on the confinement parameter. The wave functions of the
stationary states of the confined oscillator with position-dependent mass and
angular frequency are expressed in terms of the associated Legendre or
Gegenbauer polynomials. In the limit where the confinement parameter tends to
$\infty$, both the energy spectrum and the wave functions converge to the
well-known equidistant energy spectrum and the wave functions of the stationary
non-relativistic harmonic oscillator expressed in terms of Hermite polynomials.
The position-dependent effective mass and angular frequency also become

(e.g. age at disease diagnosis), and a terminal event time (e.g. age at death).
The non-terminal event is observed only if it precedes the terminal event,
which may occur before or after the non-terminal event. Studying treatment or
intervention effects on the dual event times is complicated because for some
units, the non-terminal event may occur under one treatment value but not under
the other. Until recently, existing approaches (e.g., the survivor average
causal effect) generally disregarded the time-to-event nature of both outcomes.
More recent research focused on principal strata effects within time-varying
populations under Bayesian approaches. In this paper, we propose alternative
non time-varying estimands, based on a single stratification of the population.
We present a novel assumption utilizing the time-to-event nature of the data,
which is weaker than the often-invoked monotonicity assumption. We derive

such as mitigation of anthropogenic climate change and reaching UN sustainable
development goals. Recently, social tipping processes have received increased
attention, as they present a form of social change whereby a small change can
shift a sensitive social system into a qualitatively different state due to
strongly self-amplifying (mathematically positive) feedback mechanisms. Social
tipping processes have been suggested as key drivers of sustainability
transitions emerging in the fields of technological and energy systems,
political mobilization, financial markets and sociocultural norms and
behaviors.
  Drawing from expert elicitation and comprehensive literature review, we
develop a framework to identify and characterize social tipping processes
critical to facilitating rapid social transformations. We find that social
tipping processes are distinguishable from those of already more widely studied
climate and ecological tipping dynamics. In particular, we identify human
agency, social-institutional network structures, different spatial and temporal
scales and increased complexity as key distinctive features underlying social
tipping processes. Building on these characteristics, we propose a formal
definition for social tipping processes and filtering criteria for those
processes that could be decisive for future trajectories to global
sustainability in the Anthropocene. We illustrate this definition with the
European political system as an example of potential social tipping processes,
highlighting the potential role of the FridaysForFuture movement.
  Accordingly, this analytical framework for social tipping processes can be
utilized to illuminate mechanisms for necessary transformative climate change
mitigation policies and actions.

the inflaton and the gauge field such that the energy is pumped to the dark

similarly connected. We empirically find that indeed such connectivity can be
reliably achieved and, more interestingly, it can be done by a linear path,
conditioned on having the same initialization for both. We thoroughly analyze
this observation and discuss its significance for the continual learning
process. Furthermore, we exploit this finding to propose an effective algorithm
that constrains the sequentially learned minima to behave as the multitask
solution. We show that our method outperforms several state of the art
continual learning algorithms on various vision benchmarks.

moral values, but also cultural elements of the young unemployed population in
Italy. Our findings show that there are small but significant differences in
personality and moral values, with the unemployed males to be less agreeable
while females more open to new experiences. At the same time, unemployed have a
more collectivist point of view, valuing more in-group loyalty, authority, and
purity foundations. Interestingly, topic modelling analysis did not reveal
major differences in interests and cultural elements of the unemployed.
Utilisation patterns emerged though; the employed seem to use Facebook to
connect with local activities, while the unemployed use it mostly as for

mis/disinformation. We believe these findings can help policymakers get a
deeper understanding of this population and initiatives that improve both the

the ensemble of sub-neural network models has been proposed to transfer the
knowledge among themselves with the knowledge distillation policies as well as
an adversarial learning strategy. Hence, The proposed ensemble of sub-models is
trained against a discriminator model adversarially. Besides, their knowledge
is transferred within the ensemble by four different loss functions. The
proposed method has been devoted to both lightweight image classification and
encoder-decoder architectures to boost the performance of small and compact
models without incurring extra computational overhead at the inference process.
Extensive experimental results on the main challenging datasets show that the
proposed network outperforms the primary model in terms of accuracy at the same
number of parameters and computational cost. The obtained results show that the
proposed model has achieved significant improvement over earlier ideas of
self-distillation methods. The effectiveness of the proposed models has also
been illustrated in the encoder-decoder model.

transfer functions according to a known topology, some nodes are subject to
external excitation, and some nodes are measured. The goal is to determine
which transfer functions in the network can be recovered based on the
input-output data collected from the excited and measured nodes.
  We propose a local version of network identifiability, representing the
ability to recover transfer functions which are approximately known, or to
recover them up to a discrete ambiguity. We show that local identifiability is
a generic property, establish a necessary and sufficient condition in terms of
matrix generic ranks, and exploit this condition to develop an algorithm
determining, with probability 1, which transfer functions are locally
identifiable. Our implementation presents the results graphically, and is
publicly available.

factors such as pressure, temperature and chemical composition. However, it is
unknown whether recently discovered two-dimensional (2D) van der Walls (vdW)
magnetic materials show such intriguing phenomena that can result in rich phase

existence of three magnetic phase transitions at different Tc's in 2D vdW
magnet CrI3 revealed by a complementary suite of muon spin relaxation-rotation,
superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry, and large-scale
atomistic simulations including higher-order exchange interactions. We find
that the traditionally identified Curie temperature of bulk CrI3 at 61 K does
not correspond to the long-range order in the full volume (VM) of the crystal
but rather a partial transition with less than 25% of VM being magnetically
spin-ordered. This transition is composed of highly disordered domains with the
easy-axis component of the magnetization Sz not being fully spin-polarized but
disordered by in-plane components (Sx, Sy) over the entire layer. As the system
cools down, two additional phase transitions at 50 K and 25 K drive the system
to 80% and nearly 100% of the magnetically ordered volume, respectively, where
the ferromagnetic ground state has a marked Sz character yet also displaying
finite contributions of Sx and Sy to the total magnetization. Our results
indicate that volume-wise competing electronic phases play an important role in
the magnetic properties of CrI3 which set a much lower threshold temperature

three typical RPP provision approaches are analyzed and a two-stage robust
linear optimization based RPP evaluation method is proposed. This approach
yields an RPP range that ensures the security of wind farm operations under any
realization of uncertainty regarding the wind farm. Simplified DistFlow
equations are employed here for a compromise between computational accuracy and
cost. Next, an uncertain RPP-involved reactive power optimization problem is
introduced, through which system operators ensure system-wide security and
optimality regarding the base case and against any possible deviation caused by
uncertain lumped loads and renewable generation. Steady-state models of
automatic generation control and local voltage control are also captured in
this uncertain reactive power optimization, which is then transformed through
Soyster's method into a deterministic optimization problem that is readily
solvable. Case studies have conceptually validated that even with notable
uncertainty, wind farms are still a competent reactive power resource providing
considerable RPP. Also, simulation confirms positive and notable improvement of
leveraging wind-farm RPP on system-wide operational security and optimality,
especially for power systems with high wind penetration.

  Problem",,,,,"cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for implicit data representation
to evaluate similarity of input data using a trained neural network. In
contrast to the previous approach, which uses gradients for representation, we
utilize only the outputs from the last hidden layer of a neural network and do
not use a backward step. The proposed technique explicitly takes into account
the initial task and significantly reduces the size of the vector
representation, as well as the computation time. The key point is minimization
of information loss between layers. Generally, a neural network discards
information that is not related to the problem, which makes the last hidden
layer representation useless for input similarity task. In this work, we
consider two main causes of information loss: correlation between neurons and
insufficient size of the last hidden layer. To reduce the correlation between
neurons we use orthogonal weight initialization for each layer and modify the
loss function to ensure orthogonality of the weights during training. Moreover,
we show that activation functions can potentially increase correlation. To
solve this problem, we apply modified Batch-Normalization with Dropout. Using
orthogonal weight matrices allow us to consider such neural networks as an
application of the Random Projection method and get a lower bound estimate for
the size of the last hidden layer. We perform experiments on MNIST and physical
examination datasets. In both experiments, initially, we split a set of labels
into two disjoint subsets to train a neural network for binary classification
problem, and then use this model to measure similarity between input data and
define hidden classes. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach
achieves competitive results on the input similarity task while reducing both
computation time and the size of the input representation.

the performance of audio-only speech inpainting approaches degrades rapidly

to be a natural representation. Learning the node representations in a
hypergraph is more complex than in a graph as it involves information
propagation at two levels: within every hyperedge and across the hyperedges.
Most current approaches first transform a hypergraph structure to a graph for
use in existing geometric deep learning algorithms. This transformation leads
to information loss, and sub-optimal exploitation of the hypergraph's
expressive power. We present HyperSAGE, a novel hypergraph learning framework
that uses a two-level neural message passing strategy to accurately and
efficiently propagate information through hypergraphs. The flexible design of
HyperSAGE facilitates different ways of aggregating neighborhood information.
Unlike the majority of related work which is transductive, our approach,
inspired by the popular GraphSAGE method, is inductive. Thus, it can also be
used on previously unseen nodes, facilitating deployment in problems such as
evolving or partially observed hypergraphs. Through extensive experimentation,
we show that HyperSAGE outperforms state-of-the-art hypergraph learning methods

maps. Nonetheless, dedicated studies have seldom been carried out to explore
the fundamental properties of twinning dislocations mediating this process.
Here we employ a combination of atomistic computations and continuum modeling
to investigate the nucleation of twinning dislocation loops in metals with fcc
crystal structure. Besides the conventional layer-by-layer model of twin
nucleation, the newly proposed alternate-shear mechanism has been investigated,
and the energy barrier and shear stress for twinning loop nucleation have been
determined. We find the nucleation stress in the latter mechanism to be smaller
than that in the former. The study also highlights the non-uniform variations
of the critical loop size and fractional Burgers vector with the applied shear

significant work has been done in localizing tables as graphic objects in

Most existing literature on structure recognition depends on extraction of

(OCR) models to extract low-level layout features from the image. However,
these methods fail to generalize well because of the absence of meta-features
or errors made by the OCR when there is a significant variance in table layouts
and text organization. In our work, we focus on tables that have complex

meta-features and/or OCR.
  We present an approach for table structure recognition that combines cell
detection and interaction modules to localize the cells and predict their row
and column associations with other detected cells. We incorporate structural
constraints as additional differential components to the loss function for cell
detection. We empirically validate our method on the publicly available
real-world datasets - ICDAR-2013, ICDAR-2019 (cTDaR) archival, UNLV, SciTSR,

universe as a measure of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), whereas its
signal-to-noise ratio is significantly affected by the mode coupling due to
non-linear gravitational growth. In this paper, we examine the standard
reconstruction method of linear cosmic mass density fields from non-linear
galaxy density fields to de-correlate the covariance in redshift-space galaxy
bispectra. In particular, we evaluate the covariance of the bispectrum for
massive-galaxy-sized dark matter halos with reconstruction by using 4000
independent $N$-body simulations. Our results show that the bispectrum
covariance for the post-reconstructed field approaches the Gaussian prediction
at scale of $k<0.2\, h\, {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We also verify the leading-order
PNG-induced bispectrum is not affected by details of the reconstruction with
perturbative theory. We then demonstrate the constraining power of the
post-reconstructed bispectrum for PNG at redshift of $\sim0.5$. Further, we
perform a Fisher analysis to make a forecast of PNG constraints by galaxy
bispectra including anisotropic signals. Assuming a massive galaxy sample in
the SDSS Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, we find that the
post-reconstructed bispectrum can constrain the local-, equilateral- and
orthogonal-types of PNG with $\Delta f_{\rm NL} \sim$13, 90 and 42,
respectively, improving the constraints with the pre-reconstructed bispectrum
by a factor of $1.3-3.2$. In conclusion, the reconstruction plays an essential
role in constraining various types of PNG signatures with a level of $\Delta
f_{\rm NL}<1$ from the galaxy bispectrum based on upcoming galaxy surveys.

the density function around the kernel singularity in terms of solutions of the
underlying homogeneous PDE, so as to recast singular and nearly singular
integrals in terms of bounded (or more regular) integrands. We present here a
simple interpolation strategy which, unlike previous approaches, does not
entail explicit computation of high-order derivatives of the density function

dimension-independent in the sense that the sought density interpolant is
constructed as a linear combination of point-source fields, given by the same
Green's function used in the integral equation formulation, thus making the
procedure applicable, in principle, to any PDE with known Green's function. For
the sake of definiteness, we focus here on Nystr\""om methods for the (scalar)
Laplace and Helmholtz equations and the (vector) elastostatic and time-harmonic

experimental data are accumulated. In this work, we focus on the negative
parity resonance $N^*(1895)$ which is located in the scattering region of
various meson-baryon coupled channels, and such dynamics can be crucial in
understanding its properties. To test the relevance of such hadron dynamics, we
investigate the decay properties of $N^*(1895)$ in detail. We examine how a two
pole nature of $N^*(1895)$ is compatible with its observed decay properties.
Moreover, we find that the resonance decays into final states involving
$\Lambda(1405)$ and $\Sigma(1400)$, where the latter is not yet observed
experimentally. Such decay processes can be useful to study the properties of
the aforementioned hyperon resonances.

experiment, there are entangled states which can never be used to demonstrate
nonlocal correlations. In a seminal paper [PRL 108, 200401 (2012)] F. Buscemi
extended the standard Bell experiment by allowing Alice and Bob to be asked
quantum, instead of classical, questions. This gives rise to a broader notion
of nonlocality, one which can be observed for every entangled state. In this
work we study a resource theory of this type of nonlocality referred to as
Buscemi nonlocality. We propose a geometric quantifier measuring the ability of
a given state and local measurements to produce Buscemi nonlocal correlations
and establish its operational significance. In particular, we show that any
distributed measurement which can demonstrate Buscemi nonlocal correlations
provides strictly better performance than any distributed measurement which
does not use entanglement in the task of distributed state discrimination. We
also show that the maximal amount of Buscemi nonlocality that can be generated
using a given state is precisely equal to its entanglement content. Finally, we
prove a quantitative relationship between: Buscemi nonlocality, the ability to
perform nonclassical teleportation, and entanglement. Using this relationship
we propose new discrimination tasks for which nonclassical teleportation and
entanglement lead to an advantage over their classical counterparts.

correct treatment of tidal interactions is becoming necessary. The
eccentricity, rotation, and obliquity of the planets of TRAPPIST-1 are indeed
the result of tidal evolution over the lifetime of the system. Tidal
interactions can also lead to tidal heating in the interior of the planets,
which can then be responsible for volcanism and/or surface deformation. In the
majority of studies to estimate the rotation of close-in planets or their tidal
heating, the planets are considered as homogeneous bodies and their rheology is
often taken to be a Maxwell rheology.
  We investigate here the impact of considering a multi-layer structure and an
Andrade rheology on the way planets dissipate tidal energy as a function of the
excitation frequency. We use an internal structure model, which provides the
radial profile of structural and rheological quantities to compute the tidal
response of multi-layer bodies. We then compare the outcome to the dissipation
of a homogeneous planet.
  We find that for purely rocky bodies, it is possible to approximate the
response of a multi-layer planet by that of a homogeneous planet. However,
using average profiles of shear modulus and viscosity to compute the
homogeneous planet response leads to an overestimation of the averaged
dissipation. We provide fitted values of shear modulus and viscosity to be able
to reproduce the response of various types of rocky planets. However, we find
that if the planet has an icy layer, its tidal response can no longer be
approximated by a homogeneous body because of the very different properties of
the icy layers, which lead to a second dissipation peak at higher frequencies.
We also compute the tidal heating profiles for the outer TRAPPIST-1 planets (e
to h).

clinical interventions to reduce the risk of OUD. Our goal is to predict OUD

records with machine learning and deep learning methods. This will help us to
better understand the diagnoses of OUD, providing new insights on opioid
epidemic. Electronic health records of patients who have been prescribed with
medications containing active opioid ingredients were extracted from Cerner
Health Facts database between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2017. Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were applied to predict opioid use disorder
risk in the future based on recent five encounters, and compared to Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Dense Neural Network. Prediction
performance was assessed using F-1 score, precision, recall, and AUROC. Our
temporal deep learning model provided promising prediction results which
outperformed other methods, with a F1 score of 0.8023 and AUCROC of 0.9369. The
model can identify OUD related medications and vital signs as important
features for the prediction. LSTM based temporal deep learning model is
effective on predicting opioid use disorder using a patient past history of
electronic health records, with minimal domain knowledge. It has potential to
improve clinical decision support for early intervention and prevention to

  Estimation and Forecasting in Power Grids",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Real-time state estimation and forecasting is critical for efficient
operation of power grids. In this paper, a physics-informed Gaussian process
regression (PhI-GPR) method is presented and used for probabilistic forecasting
and estimating the phase angle, angular speed, and wind mechanical power of a
three-generator power grid system using sparse measurements. In standard
data-driven Gaussian process regression (GPR), parameterized models for the
prior statistics are fit by maximizing the marginal likelihood of observed
data, whereas in PhI-GPR, we compute the prior statistics by solving stochastic
equations governing power grid dynamics. The short-term forecast of a power
grid system dominated by wind generation is complicated by the stochastic
nature of the wind and the resulting uncertain mechanical wind power. Here, we
assume that the power-grid dynamic is governed by the swing equations, and we
treat the unknown terms in the swing equations (specifically, the mechanical
wind power) as random processes, which turns these equations into stochastic
differential equations. We solve these equations for the mean and variance of
the power grid system using the Monte Carlo simulations method. We demonstrate
that the proposed PhI-GPR method can accurately forecast and estimate both
observed and unobserved states, including the mean behavior and associated
uncertainty. For observed states, we show that PhI-GPR provides a forecast
comparable to the standard data-driven GPR, with both forecasts being
significantly more accurate than the autoregressive integrated moving average
(ARIMA) forecast. We also show that the ARIMA forecast is much more sensitive
to observation frequency and measurement errors than the PhI-GPR forecast.

We argue
that, as with metric learning, contrastive learning of representations benefits
from hard negative samples (i.e., points that are difficult to distinguish from
an anchor point). The key challenge toward using hard negatives is that
contrastive methods must remain unsupervised, making it infeasible to adopt
existing negative sampling strategies that use true similarity information. In
response, we develop a new family of unsupervised sampling methods for
selecting hard negative samples where the user can control the hardness. A
limiting case of this sampling results in a representation that tightly
clusters each class, and pushes different classes as far apart as possible. The
proposed method improves downstream performance across multiple modalities,
requires only few additional lines of code to implement, and introduces no
computational overhead.

by a droplet of another, immiscible fluid. This quasi-2D experimental system is
the lower-dimensional counterpart of the wetting and wrapping of a droplet by
an elastic sheet. The simplicity of this system allows us to study the
phenomenology of partial wetting and wrapping of the droplet by measuring
angles of contact as a function of the elasticity of the filament, the applied
tension and the curvature of the droplet. We find that a purely geometric
theory gives a good description of the mechanical equilibria in the system. The
estimates of applied tension and tension in the filament obey an elastic
version of the Young-Laplace-Dupr\'e relation. However, curvatures close to the
contact line are not captured by the geometric theory, possibly because of 3D
effects at the contact line. We also find that when a highly-bendable filament
completely wraps the droplet, there is continuity of curvature at the
droplet-filament interface, leading to seamless wrapping as observed in a 3D
droplet.

unmatched uncertainty based on the PPG minimization that is applicable to a

prove that the transient performance bounds can be uniformly reduced by
decreasing the estimation sampling time. The theoretical development is

shown that for every finitary biframe there is a biframe which plays a role

biframe $\mathcal{L}$ there is a finitary biframe $\mathsf{A}(\mathcal{L})$
with a universal property analogous to that of the assembly of a frame; and
such that its main component is isomorphic to the ordered collection of
finitary quotients of $\mathcal{L}$ (i.e. its pointfree bisubspaces).
Furthermore, in the finitary biframe duality the bispace associated with
$\mathsf{A}(\mathcal{L})$ is a natural bitopological analogue of the Skula
space of the bispace associated with $\mathcal{L}$. The finitary biframe
duality gives us a notion of bisobriety which is weaker than pairwise
Hausdorffness, incomparable with the pairwise $T_1$ axiom, and stronger than
the pairwise $T_0$ axiom. The notion of pairwise $T_D$ bispaces is introduced,

that in the finitary biframe duality this axiom plays a role analogous to that

exponential disc, $\alpha = 3.36(r/R_e)$, is invalid in the simulations, where
the dominant spheroid causes a weaker gradient from $\alpha \!\simeq\! 1$ at
$R_e$ to 4 at $5R_e$. The correction in $\alpha$ for the stars due to the
gradient in $\sigma_r(r)$ is roughly balanced by the effect of the aspherical

effective projected velocity dispersion $\sigma_l$ is available, the dynamical
mass can be evaluated as $M_{\rm dyn} = K G^{-1} R_e \sigma_l^2$, where the

$^{238}$U, contribute to persistent heat production in the mantle of
terrestrial-type planets. As refractory elements, the concentrations of Th and
U in a terrestrial exoplanet are implicitly reflected in the photospheric
abundances in the stellar host. However, a robust determination of these
stellar abundances is difficult in practice owing to the general paucity and
weakness of the relevant spectral features. We draw attention to the
refractory, $r-$process element europium, which may be used as a convenient and
practical proxy for the population analysis of radiogenic heating in
exoplanetary systems. As a case study, we present a determination of Eu
abundances in the photospheres of $\alpha$ Cen A and B. We find that europium
is depleted with respect to iron by $\sim$ 0.1 dex and to silicon by $\sim$
0.15 dex compared to solar in both binary components. To first order, the
measured Eu abundances can be converted to the abundances of $^{232}$Th,
$^{235}$U and $^{238}$U with observational constraints while the abundance of
$^{40}$K is approximated independently with a Galactic chemical evolution
model. We find that the radiogenic heat budget in an $\alpha$-Cen-Earth is
$73.4^{+8.3}_{-6.9}$ TW upon its formation and $8.8^{+1.7}_{-1.3}$ TW at the
present day, respectively $23\pm5$ % and $54\pm5$ % lower than that in the
Hadean and modern Earth. As a consequence, mantle convection in an
$\alpha$-Cen-Earth is expected to be overall weaker than that of the Earth
(assuming other conditions are the same) and thus such a planet would be less
geologically active, suppressing its long-term potential to recycle its crust
and volatiles. With Eu abundances being available for a large sample of
Sun-like stars, the proposed approach can extend our ability to make
predictions about the nature of other rocky worlds.

for the electrostatic component of micelle scission energy that is the excess
free energy of the spherical endcaps with respect to the cylindrical part of

  Adaptation","Accepted to CVPR 2021",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The success of supervised learning hinges on the assumption that the training
and test data come from the same underlying distribution, which is often not
valid in practice due to potential distribution shift. In light of this, most
existing methods for unsupervised domain adaptation focus on achieving
domain-invariant representations and small source domain error. However, recent
works have shown that this is not sufficient to guarantee good generalization
on the target domain, and in fact, is provably detrimental under label
distribution shift. Furthermore, in many real-world applications it is often
feasible to obtain a small amount of labeled data from the target domain and
use them to facilitate model training with source data. Inspired by the above
observations, in this paper we propose the first method that aims to
simultaneously learn invariant representations and risks under the setting of
semi-supervised domain adaptation (Semi-DA). First, we provide a finite sample
bound for both classification and regression problems under Semi-DA. The bound
suggests a principled way to obtain target generalization, i.e. by aligning
both the marginal and conditional distributions across domains in feature
space. Motivated by this, we then introduce the LIRR algorithm for jointly

\textbf{R}isks. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on both

achieves state-of-the-art performance and significant improvements compared

of the critical factors affecting the performance of such materials is the
contribution to the heat flux of the exothermic recombination reactions at the
vehicle surface. The main objective of this work is to develop a dedicated
Bayesian framework that allows us to compare uncertain measurements with model
predictions which depend on the catalytic parameter values. Our framework
accounts for uncertainties involved in the model definition and incorporates
all measured variables with their respective uncertainties. The physical model
used for the estimation consists of a 1D boundary layer solver along the
stagnation line. The chemical production term included in the surface mass
balance depends on the catalytic recombination efficiency. As not all the
different quantities needed to simulate a reacting boundary layer can be
measured or known (such as the flow enthalpy at the inlet boundary), we propose
an optimization procedure built on the construction of the likelihood function
to determine their most likely values based on the available experimental data.
This procedure avoids the need to introduce any a priori estimates on the
nuisance quantities, namely, the boundary layer edge enthalpy, wall
temperatures, static and dynamic pressures, which would entail the use of very
wide priors. We substitute the optimal likelihood of the experimental data with
a surrogate model to make the inference procedure both faster and more robust.
We show that the resulting Bayesian formulation yields meaningful and accurate
posterior distributions of the catalytic parameters with a reduction of more
than 20% of the standard deviation with respect to previous works. We also
study the implications of an extension of the experimental procedure.

using a unique real-world naturalistic driving database from the 2nd Strategic

practical in reality. Though lots of methods for unsupervised feature selection
have been proposed, these methods select features independently, thus it is no

feature selection, and a graph regularization term is incorporated into the

efficient and simple iterative algorithm is designed to solve the proposed

optimized, a subset of optimal features will be selected in group, and the

localized initial data, in the \textit{scale-invariant case} with mass term and
two combined nonlinearities. More precisely, we consider the following
equation: $$ (E) {1cm} u_{tt}-\Delta
u+\frac{\mu}{1+t}u_t+\frac{\nu^2}{(1+t)^2}u=|u_t|^p+|u|^q, \quad \mbox{in}\
\mathbb{R}^N\times[0,\infty), $$ with small initial data. Under some
assumptions on the mass and damping coefficients, $\nu$ and $\mu>0$,
respectively, we show that blow-up region and the lifespan bound of the
solution of $(E)$ remain the same as the ones obtained in \cite{Our2} in the
case of a mass-free wave equation, it i.e. $(E)$ with $\nu=0$.
  Furthermore, using in part the computations done for $(E)$, we enhance the
result in \cite{Palmieri} on the Glassey conjecture for the solution of $(E)$
with omitting the nonlinear term $|u|^q$. Indeed, the blow-up region is
extended from $p \in (1, p_G(N+\sigma)]$, where $\sigma$ is given by (1.12)
below, to $p \in (1, p_G(N+\mu)]$ yielding, hence, a better estimate of the
lifespan when $(\mu-1)^2-4\nu^2<1$. Otherwise, the two results coincide.
Finally, we may conclude that the mass term {\it has no influence} on the
dynamics of $(E)$ (resp. $(E)$ without the nonlinear term $|u|^q$), and the
conjecture we made in \cite{Our2} on the threshold between the blow-up and the
global existence regions obtained holds true here.

We sample 2 million quarkonia wave packet trajectories and evolve them through
the QGP using HQQD to obtain their survival probabilities. The computation is
performed using three different HQQD model parameter sets in order to estimate
our systematic uncertainty. After taking into account final state feed down we
compare our results to existing experimental data for the suppression and
elliptic flow of bottomonium states and find that HQQD predictions are good
agreement with available data for $R_{AA}$ as a function of $N_{\rm part}$ and
$p_T$ collected at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} =$ 5.02 TeV. In the case of $v_2$ for the

suppression results in quite small $v_2$ for $\Upsilon(1s)$. Our prediction for
the integrated elliptic flow for $\Upsilon(1s)$ in the $10{-}90$\% centrality

$v_2[\Upsilon(1s)]$ = 0.003 $\pm$ 0.0007 $\pm\,^{0.0006}_{0.0013}$. We also
find that, due to their increased suppression, excited bottomonium states have

However, efficient deployments of them for online services in data centers

transformer structures makes it more challenging to meet the latency and
throughput constraints of serving. Second, NLP tasks take in sentences of
variable length. The variability of input dimensions brings a severe problem to

quantum Hall effect, in this work, a pi-mode anomaly is proposed in a 1+1
dimensional periodically-driven topological/normal insulator (TI/NI)
heterostructure. Usually, when coupling in a background gauge field, the zero
modes on domain walls would provide an anomalous current term that is
eventually canceled by additional boundary contributions from the topological
bulk, via the Callan-Harvey mechanism. This anomaly cancellation associated
with the generalization of bulk-boundary correspondence is called anomaly
inflow. Through our photonic modeling and setup of the Floquet TI/NI
heterostructure, for the first time, we experimentally observed the $\pi$-mode
domain wall in certain driven frequencies, which is always attached to the
reminiscent Floquet gauge that plays the vital role of an emergent background
field. Indeed, due to the possible emergence of Floquet gauge anomaly from the
driven topological bulk, the resultant $\pi$-mode anomaly can be matched on the
driven interface between Floquet domains. Prospectively, we believe our
prediction and observation could pave a new avenue on exploring anomalies in

  Perception","6 pages",,,,"cs.DC cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we propose the use of hybrid offloading of computing tasks
simultaneously to edge servers (vertical offloading) via LTE communication and
to nearby cars (horizontal offloading) via V2V communication, in order to
increase the rate at which tasks are processed compared to local processing.
Our main contribution is an optimized resource assignment and scheduling
framework for hybrid offloading of computing tasks. The framework optimally
utilizes the computational resources in the edge and in the micro cloud, while
taking into account communication constraints and task requirements. While
cooperative perception is the primary use case of our framework, the framework
is applicable to other cooperative vehicular applications with high computing
demand and significant transmission overhead. The framework is tested in a
simulated environment built on top of car traces and communication rates
exported from the Veins vehicular networking simulator. We observe a
significant increase in the processing rate of cooperative perception sensor
frames when hybrid offloading with optimized resource assignment is adopted.
Furthermore, the processing rate increases with V2V connectivity as more
computing tasks can be offloaded horizontally.

  Distance",,,,,"cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Domain adaptation refers to the learning scenario that a model learned from
the source data is applied on the target data which have the same categories
but different distribution. While it has been widely applied, the distribution
discrepancy between source data and target data can substantially affect the
adaptation performance. The problem has been recently addressed by employing
adversarial learning and distinctive adaptation performance has been reported.
In this paper, a deep adversarial domain adaptation model based on a
multi-layer joint kernelized distance metric is proposed. By utilizing the
abstract features extracted from deep networks, the multi-layer joint
kernelized distance (MJKD) between the $j$th target data predicted as the $m$th
category and all the source data of the $m'$th category is computed. Base on
MJKD, a class-balanced selection strategy is utilized in each category to
select target data that are most likely to be classified correctly and treat
them as labeled data using their pseudo labels. Then an adversarial
architecture is used to draw the newly generated labeled training data and the
remaining target data close to each other. In this way, the target data itself
provide valuable information to enhance the domain adaptation. An analysis of
the proposed method is also given and the experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed method can achieve a better performance than a number of
state-of-the-art methods.

the bending, vibration and buckling analysis of Kirchhoff plates. The DAEM
exploits the higher order continuity of the DAEM and integrates a deep
autoencoder and the minimum total potential principle in one framework yielding
an unsupervised feature learning method. The DAEM is a specific type of
feedforward deep neural network (DNN) and can also serve as function
approximator. With robust feature extraction capacity, the DAEM can more
efficiently identify patterns behind the whole energy system, such as the field
variables, natural frequency and critical buckling load factor studied in this
paper. The objective function is to minimize the total potential energy. The
DAEM performs unsupervised learning based on random generated points inside the
physical domain so that the total potential energy is minimized at all points.
For vibration and buckling analysis, the loss function is constructed based on
Rayleigh's principle and the fundamental frequency and the critical buckling
load is extracted. A scaled hyperbolic tangent activation function for the
underlying mechanical model is presented which meets the continuity requirement
and alleviates the gradient vanishing/explosive problems under bending
analysis. The DAEM can be easily implemented and we employed the Pytorch

steadily growing interest. While recent work has repeatedly demonstrated that
deep learning offers major advantages for medical image classification over
traditional methods, clinicians are often hesitant to adopt the technology
because its underlying decision-making process is considered to be
intransparent and difficult to comprehend. In recent years, this has been
addressed by a variety of approaches that have successfully contributed to
providing deeper insight. Most notably, additive feature attribution methods
are able to propagate decisions back into the input space by creating a
saliency map which allows the practitioner to ""see what the network sees.""
However, the quality of the generated maps can become poor and the images noisy
if only limited data is available - a typical scenario in clinical contexts. We
propose a novel decision explanation scheme based on CycleGAN activation
maximization which generates high-quality visualizations of classifier
decisions even in smaller data sets. We conducted a user study in which we
evaluated our method on the LIDC dataset for lung lesion malignancy

significantly due to their potential to account for the total abundance of the
cold dark matter (CDM) in the universe. The coupling between ALPs and photons
allows the spontaneous decay of ALPs into pairs of photons. For ALPs condensed
in CDM halos around galaxies, the stimulated decay of ALPs is also possible. In
this work, we examine the detectability of the radio emissions produced from
this process with forthcoming radio telescopes such as the Square Kilometer
Array (SKA) and MeerKAT. Our results, using recent more realistic sensitivity
estimates, show that previous non-observation upper-limits projected for the
SKA were highly optimistic, with the limits from dwarf galaxy observations
being weakened by an order of magnitude at least. Notably, our results also
depend far more strongly on ALP mass than previously, due to the inclusion of
frequency dependent degradation effects. We show that the strongest potential
environment to probe ALPs is nearby radio galaxies (due to the strong photon
enhancement factor). In addition, with the use of a visibility taper, ALPs in
the mass range of $4.96 \times 10^{-7} \ \text{--} \ 1.04 \times 10^{-4} \ {\rm

magnetic conversion of CDM ALPs to photons, in galactic magnetic fields, is
highly sub-dominant, even to spontaneous decay.

using feature hashing and similar data is routed to the same units. A
hash-routed network provides excellent plasticity thanks to its routed nature,
while generating stable features through the use of orthogonal feature hashing.
Each unit evolves separately and new units can be added (to be used only when

cellular environments, motor proteins, synthetic molecular motors, enzymes, and
common chemical reactions, yet that chemical activity couples to molecular
motion contrasts with generations of accumulated knowledge about diffusion at
equilibrium. To test the limits of this idea, a critical testbed is mobility of
catalytically active enzymes. Sentiment is divided about reality of enhanced
enzyme diffusion with evidence for and against. Here a master curve shows that
enzyme diffusion coefficient increases in proportion to the energy release
rate, the product of Michaelis-Menten reaction rate and Gibbs free energy
change with the highly satisfactory correlation coefficient of 0.97. For ten
catalytic enzymes (urease, acetylcholinesterase, seven enzymes from the glucose
cascade cycle, and another), our measurements span from roughly 40% enhanced
diffusion coefficient at high turnover rate and negative Gibbs free energy to
no enhancement at slow turnover rate and positive Gibbs free energy. Moreover,
two independent measures of mobility show consistency, provided that one avoids
undesirable fluorescence photophysics. The master curve presented here
quantifies the limits of both ideas, that enzymes display enhanced diffusion
and that they do not within instrumental resolution, and has possible
implications for understanding enzyme mobility in cellular environments. The
striking linear dependence for the exergonic enzymes (negative Gibbs free
energy) together with the vanishing effect for endergonic enzyme (positive
Gibbs free energy) are consistent with a physical picture where the mechanism
boosting the diffusion is an active one, utilizing the available work from the
chemical reaction.

signals as these become relevant in view of the recent experimental
developments in cavity-enhanced polarimetry and ellipsometry, where the
relevant time scales and frequencies are typically within the $\sim1-10\,\mu$s
and $\sim1-100$MHz ranges, respectively. In such experimental efforts,
single-shot analysis with high accuracy and precision becomes important when
developing experiments that study dynamical effects and/or when developing
portable instrumentations. Our results suggest that online, running-fashion,
microsecond-resolved analysis of polarimetric/ellipsometric measurements with
fractional uncertainties at the $10^{-6}$ levels, is possible, and using a
proof-of-principle experimental demonstration we show that using a
frequency-based analysis approach we can monitor and analyze signals at kHz
rates and accurately detect signal changes at microsecond time-scales.

and its relevance to school zone safety expanding the capability, usability,
and safety of dynamic physical systems through data analytics. Driving behavior
and school zone safety is a public health concern. The sequence of
instantaneous driving decisions and its variations prior to involvement in
safety critical events, defined as driving volatility, can be a leading
indicator of safety. By harnessing unique naturalistic data on more than 41,000
normal, crash, and near-crash events featuring over 9.4 million temporal
samples of real-world driving, a characterization of volatility in microscopic
driving decisions is sought at school and non-school zone locations. A big data
analytic methodology is proposed for quantifying driving volatility in
microscopic real-world driving decisions. Eight different volatility measures
are then linked with detailed event specific characteristics, health history,
driving history, experience, and other factors to examine crash propensity at
school zones. A comprehensive yet fully flexible state-of-the-art generalized
mixed logit framework is employed to fully account for distinct yet related
methodological issues of scale and random heterogeneity, containing multinomial
logit, random parameter logit, scaled logit, hierarchical scaled logit, and

economic consequences and the collapse of health systems, has raised serious
concerns in Europe, which is the most affected continent by the pandemic since
it recorded 2,388,694 cases and 190,091 deaths (39.6% of the worldwide total),
of which 71.7% (136,238) are in the United Kingdom (43,414), Italy (34,708),
France (29,778), and Spain (28,338). Unlike other countries, Greece, with about
310 confirmed cases and 18 deaths per million, is one bright exception in the
study and analysis of this phenomenon. Focusing on the peculiarities of the
disease spreading in Greece, both in epidemiological and in implementation
terms, this paper applies an exploratory analysis of COVID-19 temporal spread
in Greece and proposes a methodological approach for the modeling and
prediction of the disease based on the Regression Splines algorithm and the
change rate of the total infections. Also, it proposes a hybrid spline
regression and complex network model of social distance measures evaluating and
interpreting the spread of the disease. The overall approach contributes to
decision making and support of the public health system and to the fight

especially beneficial to rural communities in scenarios like a pandemic. In
this work we present our initial exploratory work towards one such direction --
building voice enabled banking services for multilingual societies. Speech
interaction for typical banking transactions in multilingual communities
involves the presence of filled pauses and is characterized by Code Mixing.
Code Mixing is a phenomenon where lexical items from one language are embedded
in the utterance of another. Therefore speech systems deployed for banking
applications should be able to process such content. In our work we investigate
various training strategies for building speech based intent recognition
systems. We present our results using a Naive Bayes classifier on approximate

this direction for energy saving, the application into the optimization problem
remains a challenging task. This work is targeted to outline a framework for
such problems on how the energy saving should be benchmarked, if holistic or

why data pattern augmentation at the initial deployment is a must, why the

from various countries affected by the virus. While several industries continue
to experience economic losses due to the imposed interventions, it is unclear
whether the different travel restrictions were successful in reducing COVID-19
importations. Here we develop a comprehensive framework to model daily COVID-19
importations, considering different travel bans. We quantify the temporal
effects of the restrictions and elucidate the relationship between incidence
rates in other countries, travel flows and the expected number of importations
into the country under investigation. As a cases study, we evaluate the travel
bans enforced by the Australian government. We find that international travel
bans in Australia lowered COVID-19 importations by 87.68% (83.39 - 91.35)

gain insights into how many importations to expect should borders re-open.
