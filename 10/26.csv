incorporate planning algorithms within deep reinforcement learning, enabling
performance improvements on tasks requiring long-range reasoning and
understanding of environment dynamics. This came with several limitations,
however: the model is not incentivised in any way to perform meaningful
planning computations, the underlying state space is assumed to be discrete,
and the Markov decision process (MDP) is assumed fixed and known. We propose
eXecuted Latent Value Iteration Networks (XLVINs), which combine recent
developments across contrastive self-supervised learning, graph representation
learning and neural algorithmic reasoning to alleviate all of the above
limitations, successfully deploying VIN-style models on generic environments.
XLVINs match the performance of VIN-like models when the underlying MDP is
discrete, fixed and known, and provides significant improvements to model-free
baselines across three general MDP setups.

data still poses a significant challenge. Modern analytic solutions require
near real-time responsiveness both to make them interactive and to support
automated processing. Current technologies (Hadoop, Spark, Dataflow) scan the
dataset to execute queries. They focus on providing a scalable data storage to
maximize task execution speed. We argue that these solutions fail to offer an
adequate level of interactivity since they depend on continual access to data.
In this paper we present a method for query approximation, also known as
approximate query processing (AQP), that reduce the need to scan data during
inference (query calculation), thus enabling a rapid query processing tool. We
use LSTM network to learn the relationship between queries and their results,
and to provide a rapid inference layer for predicting query results. Our method

high query throughput. We evaluated our method using twelve datasets and

2. It reduces the design cost by reusing chiplets. While black-boxing of the

shore up anti-piracy measures. Our proposals do not rely on access to the

characterize the Coxeter groups of finite rank which are domains, a central

$W_{\Theta}$ if and only if $\Gamma \cong \Theta$, thus solving the elementary
equivalence problem for most of the $2$-spherical Coxeter groups.

model maps signals onto vertices of a graph and the time-space dependencies
among signals are modeled by the edge weights. Signal components acquired from
different locations and time often have complicated functional dependencies.
Accordingly, their corresponding graph weights are learned from data and used

topology of graph, such as density. Second, they provide the connectivities of
the base graph for extracting higher level GSP-based features. The latter

analyzing the limiting ordinary differential equations (ODE) for optimization
algorithms. We show that, optimizing the non-convex loss over the weights
corresponds to optimizing some strongly convex loss over the prediction error.
As a consequence, we can leverage the classical convex optimization theory to
understand the convergence behavior of neural networks. We believe our approach
can also be extended to other optimization algorithms and network
architectures.

comprehensively review CL from various aspects including motivations,

predefined curriculum or an automatic curriculum. In particular, we summarize
existing CL designs based on the general framework of Difficulty
Measurer+Training Scheduler and further categorize the methodologies for
automatic CL into four groups, i.e., Self-paced Learning, Transfer Teacher, RL

current clinical diagnosis capabilities by making the imaging process much more
efficient, affordable, and accessible to users. The most common technique for
generating B-mode US images is delay and sum (DAS) beamforming, where an
appropriate delay is introduced to signals sampled and processed at each
transducer element. However, sampling rates that are much higher than the
Nyquist rate of the signal are required for high resolution DAS beamforming,
leading to large amounts of data, making transmission of channel data over WIFI
impractical. Moreover, the production of US images that exhibit high resolution
and good image contrast requires a large set of transducers which further
increases the data size. Previous works suggest methods for reduction in
sampling rate and in array size. In this work, we introduce compressed Fourier
domain convolutional beamforming, combining Fourier domain beamforming, sparse
convolutional beamforming, and compressed sensing methods. This allows reducing
both the number of array elements and the sampling rate in each element, while
achieving high resolution images. Using in vivo data we demonstrate that the
proposed method can generate B-mode images using 142 times less data than DAS.
Our results pave the way towards wireless US and demonstrate that high
resolution US images can be produced using sub-Nyquist sampling and a small

  Generalization with a Bayesian Model","CVPR 2022",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Amodal completion is a visual task that humans perform easily but which is
difficult for computer vision algorithms. The aim is to segment those object
boundaries which are occluded and hence invisible. This task is particularly
challenging for deep neural networks because data is difficult to obtain and
annotate. Therefore, we formulate amodal segmentation as an out-of-task and
out-of-distribution generalization problem. Specifically, we replace the fully
connected classifier in neural networks with a Bayesian generative model of the
neural network features. The model is trained from non-occluded images using
bounding box annotations and class labels only, but is applied to generalize
out-of-task to object segmentation and to generalize out-of-distribution to
segment occluded objects. We demonstrate how such Bayesian models can naturally
generalize beyond the training task labels when they learn a prior that models
the object's background context and shape. Moreover, by leveraging an outlier
process, Bayesian models can further generalize out-of-distribution to segment
partially occluded objects and to predict their amodal object boundaries. Our
algorithm outperforms alternative methods that use the same supervision by a
large margin, and even outperforms methods where annotated amodal segmentations
are used during training, when the amount of occlusion is large. Code is

valley with the $p_{z}$ symmetry and $D$ valleys of the $p_{x}$ origin, located
at the Brillouin zone (BZ) center and near the time reversal invariant momenta

perpendicular electric field, giant Rashba SOC is activated for the $p_{x}$
bands to produce strong spin-polarized $D^{+}$ and $D^{-}$ valleys related by
time-reversal symmetry, coexisting with weak $\Gamma$ Rashba bands constrained
by the $p_{z}$ symmetry. Intriguingly, strong Stark effect shows the same

orchestrating effect between SOC and Stark allows us to realize gate-tunable
spin valley manipulations for 2D hole gas, as revealed by unconventional

the quantization of the $\Gamma$ Rashba bands is characterized by peculiar
density-dependent transitions in band topology from two parabolic valleys to a

with advances in quantum technologies. Many works have suggested great
possibilities of using near-term quantum hardware in supervised learning.
Motivated by these developments, we present an embedding-based framework for
supervised learning with trainable quantum circuits. We introduce both explicit
and implicit approaches. The aim of these approaches is to map data from
different classes to separated locations in the Hilbert space via the quantum
feature map. We will show that the implicit approach is a generalization of a
recently introduced strategy, so-called \textit{quantum metric learning}. In
particular, with the implicit approach, the number of separated classes (or
their labels) in supervised learning problems can be arbitrarily high with
respect to the number of given qubits, which surpasses the capacity of some
current quantum machine learning models. Compared to the explicit method, this
implicit approach exhibits certain advantages over small training sizes.
Furthermore, we establish an intrinsic connection between the explicit approach
and other quantum supervised learning models. Combined with the implicit
approach, this connection provides a unified framework for quantum supervised
learning. The utility of our framework is demonstrated by performing both
noise-free and noisy numerical simulations. Moreover, we have conducted
classification testing with both implicit and explicit approaches using several
IBM Q devices.

achieve disentanglement by penalizing the (aggregate) posterior to encourage
statistical independence of the latent factors. This approach introduces a
trade-off between disentangled representation learning and reconstruction
quality since the model does not have enough capacity to learn correlated
latent variables that capture detail information present in most image data. To
overcome this trade-off, we present a novel multi-stage modelling approach
where the disentangled factors are first learned using a preexisting
disentangled representation learning method (such as $\beta$-TCVAE); then, the
low-quality reconstruction is improved with another deep generative model that
is trained to model the missing correlated latent variables, adding detail
information while maintaining conditioning on the previously learned
disentangled factors. Taken together, our multi-stage modelling approach
results in a single, coherent probabilistic model that is theoretically
justified by the principal of D-separation and can be realized with a variety
of model classes including likelihood-based models such as variational
autoencoders, implicit models such as generative adversarial networks, and
tractable models like normalizing flows or mixtures of Gaussians. We
demonstrate that our multi-stage model has much higher reconstruction quality
than current state-of-the-art methods with equivalent disentanglement
performance across multiple standard benchmarks.

solutions in the framework of the Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (EsGB) theory.
Particularly we study a family of theories where the coupling function
$f(\phi)$ between the scalar field of the theory and the quadratic Gauss-Bonnet
gravitational term has an arbitrary form. At first, we analytically derive that
the aforementioned family of theories may evade the constraints imposed by
Bekenstein's No-Scalar Hair theorems and new solutions for black holes may be
found. Then, using numerical integration methods we find solutions for black
holes for many different forms of the coupling function. Also we derive their
physical characteristics namely their mass, scalar charge, horizon area and
entropy as well. Subsequently, by introducing a cosmological constant in the
theory we investigate the existence of novel black-hole solutions.
Specifically, assuming that the cosmological constant may be positive or
negative we find numerical solutions which are asymptotically de Sitter or
anti-de Sitter. In addition, as in the case of the asymptotically flat black
holes, for each case we derive their physical characteristics. Finally, in the
framework of the EsGB theory we derive novel wormhole solutions. The
Gauss-Bonnet wormholes are traversable, may have a single or a double throat

against the modulational (snake) instabilities and can break in vortex streets.
This behavior has been investigated in nonlinear optical crystals and ultracold
atomic gases. However, a deep characterization of this phenomenon is still
missing. In a resonantly pumped 2D polariton superfluid, we use an all-optical
imprinting technique together with the bistability of the polariton system to
create dark solitons in confined channels. Due to the snake instabilities, the
solitons are unstable and break in arrays of vortex streets whose dynamical
evolution is frozen by the pump-induced confining potential, allowing their
direct observation in our system. A deep quantitative study shows that the
vortex street period is proportional to the quantum fluid healing length, in

a presence of incompatibilities between jobs. The incompatibility relation can
be modeled as a complete multipartite graph in which each edge denotes a pair
of jobs that cannot be scheduled on the same machine. Our research stems from
the work of Bodlaender et al.~[1992, 1993]. In particular, we pursue the line
investigated partially by Mallek et al.~[2019], where the graph is complete
multipartite so each machine can do jobs only from one partition. We also tie
our results to the recent approach for so-called identical machines with class
constraints by Jansen et al.~[2019], providing a link between our case and
their generalization. In the paper we provide several algorithms constructing
schedules, optimal or approximate with respect to the two most popular criteria
of optimality: Cmax (the makespan) and {\Sigma}Cj(the total completion time).
We consider a variety of machine types in our paper: identical, uniform,
unrelated, and a natural subcase of unrelated machines. Our results consist of
delimitation of the easy (polynomial) and NP-hard problems within these
constraints. In the case when the problem is hard, we also provide algorithm,
either with a guaranteed constant worst-case approximation ratio or even in
some cases a PTAS. In particular, we fill the gap on research for the problem
of finding a schedule with smallest total completion time on uniform machines.
We address this problem by developing a linear programming relaxation technique
with an appropriate rounding, which to our knowledge is a novelty for this
criterion in the considered setting.

radially symmetric scalar quantum field in a coherent initial state. The
formalism utilizes a Fock space basis in the initial metric, is unitary and
time reversal invariant up to numerical precision. It maintains exact
compatibility of the metric with the expectation values of the energy momentum
tensor in the scalar field coherent state throughout the entire time evolution.
We find a simple criterion for the smallness of discretization effects, which
is violated when a horizon forms. As a first example, we study the collapse of
a specific state in the angular momentum $l=0$ approximation. Outside the
simulated volume it produces a Schwarzschild metric with $r_s \sim 3.5 \ell_p$.
We see behaviour that is compatible with the onset of horizon formation both in
the semiclassical and corresponding classical cases in a regime where we see no
evidence for large discretization artefacts. In our example setting, we see
that quantum effects accelerate the possible horizon formation and move it
radially outward. We find that this effect is robust against variations of the
radial resolution, the time step, the volume, the initial position and shape of
the inmoving state, the vacuum subtraction, the discretization of the time
evolution operator and the integration scheme of the metric. We briefly discuss
potential improvements of the method and the possibility of applying it to
black hole evaporation. We also briefly touch on the extension of our formalism
to higher angular momenta, but leave the details and numerics for a forthcoming

the sizes of the non-family asteroids in the inner belt are correlated with

formation is the existence of a vast population of dark matter haloes extending
to subsolar masses. By contrast, other dark matter models, such as a warm
thermal relic (WDM), predict a cutoff in the mass function at a mass which, for
popular models, lies approximately between $10^7$ and $10^{10}~{\rm M}_\odot$.
We use mock observations to demonstrate the viability of a forward modelling
approach to extract information about low-mass dark haloes lying along the
line-of-sight to galaxy-galaxy strong lenses. This can be used to constrain the
mass of a thermal relic dark matter particle, $m_\mathrm{DM}$. With 50 strong
lenses at Hubble Space Telescope resolution and a maximum pixel signal-to-noise
ratio of $\sim50$, the expected median 2$\sigma$ constraint for a CDM-like
model (with a halo mass cutoff at $10^{7}~{\rm M}_\odot$) is $m_\mathrm{DM} >
4.10 \, \mathrm{keV}$ (50% chance of constraining $m_{\rm DM}$ to be better
than 4.10 keV). If, however, the dark matter is a warm particle of
$m_\mathrm{DM}=2.2 \, \mathrm{keV}$, our 'Approximate Bayesian Computation'
method would result in a median estimate of $m_\mathrm{DM}$ between 1.43 and
3.21 keV. Our method can be extended to the large samples of strong lenses that
will be observed by future telescopes, and could potentially rule out the
standard CDM model of cosmogony. To aid future survey design, we quantify how

an alternative deployment for conventional cellular massive MIMO networks.
Prior works relied on the strong assumption (quite idealized) that the APs are
uniformly distributed, and actually, this randomness was considered during the
simulation and not in the analysis. However, in practice, ongoing and future
networks become denser and increasingly irregular. Having this in mind, we
consider that the AP locations are modeled by means of a Poisson point process
(PPP) which is a more realistic model for the spatial randomness than a grid or
uniform deployment. In particular, by virtue of stochastic geometry tools, we
derive both the downlink coverage probability and achievable rate. Notably,
this is the only work providing the coverage probability and shedding light on
this aspect of CF massive MIMO systems. Focusing on the extraction of
interesting insights, we consider small-cells (SCs) as a benchmark for
comparison. Among the findings, CF massive MIMO systems achieve both higher
coverage and rate with comparison to SCs due to the properties of favorable
propagation, channel hardening, and interference suppression. Especially, we
showed for both architectures that increasing the AP density results in a
higher coverage which saturates after a certain value and increasing the number
of users decreases the achievable rate but CF massive MIMO systems take
advantage of the aforementioned properties, and thus, outperform SCs. In
general, the performance gap between CF massive MIMO systems and SCs is
enhanced by increasing the AP density. Another interesting observation concerns

the UV~Fe~II band from 2008-2018. We found that an increase in the 43 GHz flux

projected distance of $\sim4.6$ pc from the radio core). The spectral index
different behavior in the first ($5000 < \text{JD}-2450000 < 5600$) and second
($6600 < \text{JD}-2450000 < 7900$) flaring periods suggest changes in the
physical conditions. The complex nature of the second period can be a result of
a superposition of multiple events at different locations. The Mg~II has an
anti-correlation with the UV-continuum while Fe~II correlates positively.
Except by the time of the brightest flare of 2010, when both have a strong
response at high continuum luminosities. Our results suggest that the dominant
gamma-ray emission mechanism for the first flaring period is External Compton.
For the second flaring period the seed photons emission region is co-spatial
with the gamma-ray emission region. However, a SED study using a multizone jet

the distribution strategy, without adding any computation overhead. First, we
examine the characteristics of the model structure that make it susceptible to
privacy threats. We found that the more we divide the model feature maps into a
high number of devices, the better we hide proprieties of the original image.
We formulate such a methodology, namely DistPrivacy, as an optimization
problem, where we establish a trade-off between the latency of co-inference,
the privacy level of the data, and the limited-resources of IoT participants.
Due to the NP-hardness of the problem, we introduce an online heuristic that
supports heterogeneous IoT devices as well as multiple DNNs and datasets,

low decision-latency applications.

conservation. Subsequently, we subject the system to a step strain by
separating the drops in a step wise manner, and track the evolution of the
bilayer contact angle and radius. The relaxation time of the bilayer contact
angle and radius, along with the decay magnitude of the bilayer radius were
observed to increase with each separation step. By analyzing the forces acting
on the bilayer and the rate of separation, we show that the bilayer separates
primarily through the peeling process with the dominant resistance to
separation coming from viscous dissipation associated with corner flows.
Finally, we explain the intrinsic features of the observed bilayer separation
by means of a mathematical model comprising of the Young-Laplace equation and
an evolution equation. We believe that the reported experimental and numerical

calculations at high temperature and density functional molecular dynamics
simulations at lower temperatures. We then use the ideal mixing approximation
at constant pressure and temperature to rederive these Hugoniot curves from the
EOS tables of the individual elements. We find that the linear mixing
approximation works remarkably well at temperatures above ~2*10^5 K, where the
shock compression ratio exceeds ~3.2. The shape of the Hugoniot curve of each
compound is well reproduced. Regions of increased shock compression, that
emerge because of the ionization of L and K shell electrons, are well
represented and the maximum compression ratio on the Hugoniot curves is
reproduced with high precision. Some deviations are seen near the onset of the
L shell ionization regime, where ionization equilibrium in the fully
interacting system cannot be well reproduced by the ideal mixing approximation.
This approximation also breaks down at lower temperatures, where chemical bonds
play an increasingly import role. However, the results imply that equilibrium
properties of binary and ternary mixtures in the regime of WDM can be derived

the characterization of binary and ternary mixtures in the WDM and plasma
phases, which otherwise requires large numbers of more computationally

and encode the data structure in high dimensional and non-Euclidean feature
space to a low dimensional and structural space, which is easily exploited by
other machine learning algorithms. We have witnessed a huge surge of such
embedding methods, from statistical approaches to recent deep learning methods
such as the graph convolutional networks (GCN). Deep learning approaches
usually outperform the traditional methods in most graph learning benchmarks by
building an end-to-end learning framework to optimize the loss function
directly. However, most of the existing GCN methods can only perform
convolution operations with node features, while ignoring the handy information
in edge features, such as relations in knowledge graphs. To address this
problem, we present CensNet, Convolution with Edge-Node Switching graph neural

nodes and edges to a latent feature space. By using line graph of the original

fusion of multiple detection networks. The computational complexity is an
essential factor in training deep neural networks; therefore, to reduce the
computational complexity while learning multiple feature representation layers,

the channel estimation for conjugate beamforming can be carried out when unused
S-preambles are known, a simple approach is derived to detect unused
S-preambles and its performance is analyzed for a special case (superpositions
with 2 preambles). Based on analysis and simulation results, it is confirmed
that the proposed approach with S-preambles can increase the success

the adhesion strength and the energy requirements for partial membrane
detachment, controlling the Pt surface area that is accessible for reactant

approach to perform DECT imaging by using standard SECT data. We designed a
predenoising and difference learning mechanism to generate DECT images from
SECT data. The performance of the deep learning-based DECT approach was studied
using images from patients who received contrast-enhanced abdomen DECT scan
with a popular DE application: virtual non-contrast (VNC) imaging and contrast
quantification. Clinically relevant metrics were used for quantitative
assessment. The absolute HU difference between the predicted and original
high-energy CT images are 1.3 HU, 1.6 HU, 1.8 HU and 1.3 HU for the ROIs on
aorta, liver, spine and stomach, respectively. The aorta iodine quantification
difference between iodine maps obtained from the original and deep learning
DECT images is smaller than 1.0\%, and the noise levels in the material images
have been reduced by more than 7-folds for the latter. This study demonstrates
that highly accurate DECT imaging with single low-energy data is achievable by
using a deep learning approach. The proposed method allows us to obtain
high-quality DECT images without paying the overhead of conventional
hardware-based DECT solutions and thus leads to a new paradigm of spectral CT

data to monitor the impacts of non-pharmaceutical interventions (e.g.,

locations of potential outbreak occurrence is difficult using mobility data
alone. Meanwhile, web search queries have been shown to be good predictors of
the disease spread. In this study, we utilize a unique dataset of human
mobility trajectories (GPS traces) and web search queries with common user
identifiers (> 450K users), to predict COVID-19 hotspot locations beforehand.
More specifically, web search query analysis is conducted to identify users
with high risk of COVID-19 contraction, and social contact analysis was further
performed on the mobility patterns of these users to quantify the risk of an
outbreak. Our approach is empirically tested using data collected from users in
Tokyo, Japan. We show that by integrating COVID-19 related web search query

the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) method and exact
diagonalization. We clarify that the HHG originates from the doublon-holon
recombination, and the scaling of the cutoff frequency is consistent with a
linear dependence on the external field. We demonstrate that the subcycle
features of the HHG can be reasonably described by a phenomenological three
step model for a doublon-holon pair. We argue that the HHG in the
one-dimensional Mott insulator is closely related to the dispersion of the
doublon-holon pair with respect to its relative momentum, which is not
necessarily captured by the single-particle spectrum due to the many-body
nature of the elementary excitations. For the comparison to semiconductors, we
introduce effective models obtained from the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation,
i.e. a strong-coupling expansion, which allows us to disentangle the different
processes involved in the Hubbard model: intraband dynamics of doublons and
holons, interband dipole excitations, and spin exchanges. These demonstrate the
formal similarity of the Mott system to the semiconductor models in the dipole
gauge, and reveal that the spin dynamics, which does not directly affect the
charge dynamics, can reduce the HHG intensity. We also show that the long-range
component of the intraband dipole moment has a substantial effect on the HHG
intensity, while the correlated hopping terms for the doublons and holons
essentially determine the shape of the HHG spectrum. A new numerical method to
evaluate single-particle spectra within the iTEBD method is also introduced.

low mass dark matter, and give approximations for the dark matter up-scattering
rate and evaporation mass. We apply these results to scattering of dark matter

influence in political and social campaigns. We observe a high surge in
information and propaganda flow during election campaigning. In this paper, we
explore a high-quality large-scale user-generated dataset curated from WhatsApp
comprising of 281 groups, 31,078 unique users, and 223,404 messages shared
before, during, and after the Indian General Elections 2019, encompassing all
major Indian political parties and leaders. In addition to the raw noisy
user-generated data, we present a fine-grained annotated dataset of 3,848
messages that will be useful to understand the various dimensions of WhatsApp
political campaigning. We present several complementary insights into the
investigative and sensational news stories from the same period. Exploratory
data analysis and experiments showcase several exciting results and future
research opportunities. To facilitate reproducible research, we make the
anonymized datasets available in the public domain.

While Mask-CTC achieves remarkably fast inference speed, its recognition

allows the model to delete or insert tokens during inference. Experimental
results on different ASR tasks show that the proposed approaches improve
Mask-CTC significantly, outperforming a standard CTC model (15.5% $\rightarrow$

develop a visualization framework to address interpretability of uncertainty

Convolutional Neural Network. This framework aims to understand the
contribution of individual features in the Chest-X-Ray images to predictive
uncertainty. Providing this as an assistive tool can help the radiologist
understand why the model came up with a prediction and whether the regions of

Traditional approaches that find equi-joinable tables are unable to deal with

this paper, we propose PEXESO, a framework for joinable table discovery in data
lakes. We embed textual values as high-dimensional vectors and join columns
under similarity predicates on high-dimensional vectors, hence to address the
limitations of equi-join approaches and identify more meaningful results. To
efficiently find joinable tables with similarity, we propose a block-and-verify
method that utilizes pivot-based filtering. A partitioning technique is
developed to cope with the case when the data lake is large and the index
cannot fit in main memory. An experimental evaluation on real datasets shows
that our solution identifies substantially more tables than equi-joins and
outperforms other similarity-based options, and the join results are useful in
data enrichment for machine learning tasks. The experiments also demonstrate
the efficiency of the proposed method.

estimation. Such estimation is important for the online management of this

for Li-S state estimation. This article's main goal is to perform estimation
using a physics-based model instead. This approach is attractive because it
furnishes online estimates of the masses of individual species in a given Li-S
cell. The estimation is performed using an experimentally-validated,
computationally tractable zero-dimensional model. Reformulation converts this
model from differential algebraic equations (DAEs) to ordinary differential
equations (ODEs), simplifying the estimation problem. The article's first
contribution is to show that this model has poor observability, especially in
the low plateau region, where the low sensitivity of cell voltage to
precipitated sulfur mass complicates the estimation of this mass. The second
contribution is to exploit mass conservation to derive a reduced-order model
with attractive observability properties in both high and low plateau regions.
The final contribution is to use an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) for
estimating internal Li-S battery states, while taking constraints on species
masses into account. Consistent with the article's observability analysis, the
UKF achieves better low-plateau estimation accuracy when the reduced-order
model is used.

shock-capturing schemes with flexible and controllable nonlinear dissipation
for convection-dominated problems is proposed. While a set of candidate
stencils of incremental width is constructed, each one is indicated as smooth
or nonsmooth by the ENO-like stencil selection procedure proposed in the
targeted essentially non-oscillatory (TENO) scheme [Fu et al., Journal of
Computational Physics 305 (2016): 333-359]. Rather than being discarded
directly as with TENO schemes, the nonsmooth candidates are filtered by an
extra nonlinear limiter, such as a monotonicity-preserving (MP) limiter or a
total variation diminishing (TVD) limiter. Consequently, high-order
reconstruction is achieved by assembling candidate fluxes with optimal linear
weights since they are either smooth reconstructions or filtered ones which
feature good non-oscillation property. A weight renormalization procedure as
with the standard TENO paradigm is not necessary. This new framework
concatenates the concepts of TENO, WENO and other nonlinear limiters for
shock-capturing, and provides a new insight to designing low-dissipation
nonlinear schemes. Through the adaptation of nonlinear limiters, nonlinear
dissipation in the newly proposed framework can be controlled separately
without affecting the performance in smooth regions. Based on the proposed
framework, a family of new six- and eight-point nonlinear schemes with
controllable dissipation is proposed. A set of critical benchmark cases
involving strong discontinuities and broadband fluctuations is simulated.
Numerical results reveal that the proposed new schemes capture discontinuities
sharply and resolve the high-wavenumber fluctuations with low dissipation,
while maintaining the desired accuracy order in smooth regions.

two MIT relevant energy scales, an estimated Hubbard interaction and the charge
transfer energy, as well as the structure-bond-stress metric referred to as the
global-instability index (GII). We then perform supervised classification,
constructing three electronic-state classifiers: metal vs non-metal (M),
insulator vs non-insulator (I), and MIT vs non-MIT (T). We identify two
important descriptors that separate metals, insulators, and MIT materials in a
2D feature space: the average deviation of the covalent radius and the range of
the Mendeleev number. We further elaborate on other important features (GII and
Ewald energy), and examine how they affect classification of binary vanadium

the physical interactions underlying MITs in the rare-earth nickelate family.

synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) image classification. Given the constant
resolution with range of a SAS, it is no surprise that deep learning techniques
perform so well. Despite deep learning's recent success, there are still
compelling open challenges in reducing the high false alarm rate and enabling
success when training imagery is limited, which is a practical challenge that
distinguishes the SAS classification problem from standard image classification
set-ups where training imagery may be abundant. We address these challenges by
exploiting prior knowledge that humans use to grasp the scene. These include
unconscious elimination of the image speckle and localization of objects in the
scene. We introduce a new deep learning architecture which incorporates these
priors with the goal of improving automatic target recognition (ATR) from SAS
imagery. Our proposal -- called SPDRDL, Structural Prior Driven Regularized
Deep Learning -- incorporates the previously mentioned priors in a multi-task
convolutional neural network (CNN) and requires no additional training data
when compared to traditional SAS ATR methods. Two structural priors are
enforced via regularization terms in the learning of the network: (1)
structural similarity prior -- enhanced imagery (often through despeckling)
aids human interpretation and is semantically similar to the original imagery
and (2) structural scene context priors -- learned features ideally encapsulate
target centering information; hence learning may be enhanced via a
regularization that encourages fidelity against known ground truth target
shifts (relative target position from scene center). Experiments on a
challenging real-world dataset reveal that SPDRDL outperforms state-of-the-art
deep learning and other competing methods for SAS image classification.

The effective integration of computation and communication is achieved by

over shared wireless channels, the undesirable propagation error inevitably
deteriorates the performance of global aggregation. The objective of this work
is to 1) reduce the signal distortion of AirComp; 2) enhance the convergence
rate of federated learning. Thus, the mean-square-error and the device set are
optimized by designing the transmit power, controlling the receive scalar,
tuning the phase shifts, and selecting participants in the model uploading
process. The formulated mixed-integer non-linear problem (P0) is decomposed
into a non-convex problem (P1) with continuous variables and a combinatorial
problem (P2) with integer variables. To solve subproblem (P1), the closed-form
expressions for transceivers are first derived, then the multi-antenna cases
are addressed by the semidefinite relaxation. Next, the problem of phase shifts
design is tackled by invoking the penalty-based successive convex approximation
method. In terms of subproblem (P2), the difference-of-convex programming is
adopted to optimize the device set for convergence acceleration, while
satisfying the aggregation error demand. After that, an alternating
optimization algorithm is proposed to find a suboptimal solution for problem
(P0). Finally, simulation results demonstrate that i) the designed algorithm
can converge faster and aggregate model more accurately compared to baselines;
ii) the training loss and prediction accuracy of federated learning can be
improved significantly with the aid of multiple RISs.

computational complexity, i.e., there is no increase in the per-node complexity

convergence acceleration in deep-unfolded gradient descent (DUGD) whose

Chebyshev steps derived from Chebyshev polynomials. The use of Chebyshev steps

be asymptotically optimal, although it has no momentum terms. We also show that
Chebyshev steps numerically explain the learned step-size parameters in DUGD

self-supervised pre-training can lead to state-of-the-art robustness In this
work, we improve robustness-aware self-supervised pre-training by learning
representations that are consistent under both data augmentations and
adversarial perturbations. Our approach leverages a recent contrastive learning
framework, which learns representations by maximizing feature consistency under
differently augmented views. This fits particularly well with the goal of
adversarial robustness, as one cause of adversarial fragility is the lack of
feature invariance, i.e., small input perturbations can result in undesirable
large changes in features or even predicted labels. We explore various options
to formulate the contrastive task, and demonstrate that by injecting
adversarial perturbations, contrastive pre-training can lead to models that are
both label-efficient and robust. We empirically evaluate the proposed
Adversarial Contrastive Learning (ACL) and show it can consistently outperform
existing methods. For example on the CIFAR-10 dataset, ACL outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art unsupervised robust pre-training approach by 2.99% on
robust accuracy and 2.14% on standard accuracy. We further demonstrate that ACL
pre-training can improve semi-supervised adversarial training, even when only a
few labeled examples are available. Our codes and pre-trained models have been

faster and require less memory than 3D convolutions. Secondly, we propose an
attention-based spatial residual module to generate attention-aware residual
features. The attention mechanism is applied to provide intuitive spatial
evidence about inaccurate regions with the help of error maps at multiple

on the Scene Flow and KITTI datasets show that EDNet outperforms the previous
3D CNN based works and achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly
faster speed and less memory consumption.

Design for Extreme Scale Simulations'' held March 1-6, 2020 at Schloss
Dagstuhl, that was attended by all the authors.
  Naive versions of conventional resilience techniques will not scale to the
exascale regime: with a main memory footprint of tens of Petabytes,
synchronously writing checkpoint data all the way to background storage at
frequent intervals will create intolerable overheads in runtime and energy
consumption. Forecasts show that the mean time between failures could be lower
than the time to recover from such a checkpoint, so that large calculations at
scale might not make any progress if robust alternatives are not investigated.
  More advanced resilience techniques must be devised. The key may lie in
exploiting both advanced system features as well as specific application
knowledge. Research will face two essential questions: (1) what are the
reliability requirements for a particular computation and (2) how do we best
design the algorithms and software to meet these requirements? One avenue would
be to refine and improve on system- or application-level checkpointing and
rollback strategies in the case an error is detected. Developers might use
fault notification interfaces and flexible runtime systems to respond to node
failures in an application-dependent fashion. Novel numerical algorithms or
more stochastic computational approaches may be required to meet accuracy
requirements in the face of undetectable soft errors.
  The goal of this Dagstuhl Seminar was to bring together a diverse group of
scientists with expertise in exascale computing to discuss novel ways to make
applications resilient against detected and undetected faults. In particular,
participants explored the role that algorithms and applications play in the
holistic approach needed to tackle this challenge.

reproducing nuclear properties and astronomical observations in an effort to
constrain especially L and Ksym or the droplet-model counterpart Ktau. Assuming
a standard EoS for symmetric matter, we explore several points on the
hyperplane of (J,L,Ksym or Ktau) values. For each point, the corresponding EDF
parameters and a pairing parameter are obtained for applications in spherical
even-even nuclei. This is the first application of KIDS EDFs with pairing
correlations. The EoSs are tested successively on properties of closed-shell
nuclei, along the Sn isotopic chain, and on astronomical observations, in a
step-by-step process of elimination and correction. A small regime of
best-performing parameters is determined. The results strongly suggest that
Ksym is negative and no lower than -200MeV, that Ktau lies between roughly -400
and -300MeV and that L lies between 40 and 65MeV with L<55MeV more likely.
Correlations between symmetry-energy parameters are critically discussed.
Predictions for the position of the neutron drip line and the neutron skin
thickness of selected nuclei are reported. They are only weakly affected by the
choice of effective mass values. Parts of the drip line can be sensitive to the
SE parameters. The results underscore the role of Ktau and of precise
astronomical input. Better constraints are possible with precise fits to

neural network-based algorithm to obtain point-wise semantics from the input
laser point cloud, and then use semantic labels to separate the road, building,
traffic sign and pole-like point cloud and fit them separately to obtain
corresponding PSFs. A fast PSF-based matching enable us to refine geometric
features (GeFs) registration, reducing the impact of blurred submap surface on
the accuracy of GeFs matching. Besides, we design an efficient method to
accurately recognize and remove the dynamic objects while retaining static ones
in the semantic point cloud, which are beneficial to further improve the
accuracy of LO. We evaluated our method, namely PSF-LO, on the public dataset
KITTI Odometry Benchmark and ranked #1 among semantic lidar methods with an
average translation error of 0.82% in the test dataset at the time of writing.

  Exclusivity Analysis","Accepted by USENIX Security'22; A preprint version",,,,"cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Among existing privacy attacks on the gradient of neural networks, \emph{data
reconstruction attack}, which reverse engineers the training batch from the
gradient, poses a severe threat on the private training data. Despite its
empirical success on large architectures and small training batches, unstable
reconstruction accuracy is also observed when a smaller architecture or a
larger batch is under attack. Due to the weak interpretability of existing
learning-based attacks, there is little known on why, when and how data
reconstruction attack is feasible.
  In our work, we perform the first analytic study on the security boundary of
data reconstruction from gradient via a microcosmic view on neural networks
with rectified linear units (ReLUs), the most popular activation function in
practice. For the first time, we characterize the insecure/secure boundary of
data reconstruction attack in terms of the \emph{neuron exclusivity state} of a
training batch, indexed by the number of \emph{\textbf{Ex}clusively
\textbf{A}ctivated \textbf{N}eurons} (ExANs, i.e., a ReLU activated by only one
sample in a batch). Intuitively, we show a training batch with more ExANs are
more vulnerable to data reconstruction attack and vice versa. On the one hand,
we construct a novel deterministic attack algorithm which substantially
outperforms previous attacks for reconstructing training batches lying in the
insecure boundary of a neural network. Meanwhile, for training batches lying in
the secure boundary, we prove the impossibility of unique reconstruction, based
on which an exclusivity reduction strategy is devised to enlarge the secure
boundary for mitigation purposes.

difficult to train by SGD-type methods (may fail to converge) and the
distributed SGD-type methods may also suffer from massive amount of
communication cost. In this paper, we propose a {distributed GANs training

distributed training method with quantized gradient for GANs. The new method
trains GANs based on a specific single machine algorithm called Optimistic
Mirror Descent (OMD) algorithm, and is applicable to any gradient compression
method that satisfies a general $\delta$-approximate compressor. The
error-feedback operation we designed is used to compensate for the bias caused
by the compression, and moreover, ensure the convergence of the new method.
Theoretically, we establish the non-asymptotic convergence of {DQGAN} algorithm
to first-order stationary point, which shows that the proposed algorithm can
achieve a linear speedup in the parameter server model. Empirically, our
experiments show that our {DQGAN} algorithm can reduce the communication cost

approach is to resort to matrix factorization, where the low-rank matrix
factors are optimized via first-order methods over a smooth loss function, such

Adversarial training is the most widely used technique for improving

evaluating and improving the model average robustness without class-wise
evaluation. The average evaluation alone might provide a false sense of
robustness. For example, the attacker can focus on attacking the vulnerable
class, which can be dangerous, especially, when the vulnerable class is a
critical one, such as ""human"" in autonomous driving. We propose an empirical

phenomenon of inter-class discrepancy universal regardless of datasets, model

by clustering speaker embeddings such as x-vectors. While it can be seen as a
current state-of-the-art approach that works for various challenging data with
reasonable robustness and accuracy, it has a critical disadvantage that it
cannot handle overlapped speech that is inevitable in natural conversational
data. In contrast, the end-to-end neural diarization (EEND), which directly
predicts diarization labels using a neural network, was devised to handle the
overlapped speech. While the EEND, which can easily incorporate emerging
deep-learning technologies, has started outperforming the x-vector clustering
approach in some realistic database, it is difficult to make it work for `long'
recordings (e.g., recordings longer than 10 minutes) because of, e.g., its huge
memory consumption. Block-wise independent processing is also difficult because
it poses an inter-block label permutation problem, i.e., an ambiguity of the
speaker label assignments between blocks. In this paper, we propose a simple
but effective hybrid diarization framework that works with overlapped speech
and for long recordings containing an arbitrary number of speakers. It modifies
the conventional EEND framework to simultaneously output global speaker
embeddings so that speaker clustering can be performed across blocks to solve
the permutation problem. With experiments based on simulated noisy reverberant
2-speaker meeting-like data, we show that the proposed framework works
significantly better than the original EEND especially when the input data is

of meaningful effect sizes, then relate regions defined in these plots to the
decisions made by MBD. We then mathematically show how MBD fits within a class
of multiple decision procedures. We have implemented this theoretically sound
version of MBD as a visualisation tool that supports generalised funnel plots.
The use of MBD could encourage researchers to plan test directionalities, test
levels and error definitions, and the visualisation tool may help stakeholders
engage with the design of analyses and the interpretation of trial findings.

the collider phenomenology such that the lower bound on the mass of the triplet

high triplet mass is in tension with the parameter space that leads to novel

hierarchy of plume structures and flow patterns. The gradual aggregation of
convection cells or granules to a supergranule which eventually fills the whole
horizontal layer is reported and analysed in spectral element direct numerical
simulations of three-dimensional turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection at an
aspect ratio of $60$. The formation proceeds over a time span of more than
$10^4$ convective time units for the largest accessible Rayleigh number and
occurs only when the turbulence is driven by a constant heat flux which is
imposed at the bottom and top planes enclosing the convection layer. The
resulting gradual inverse cascade process is observed for both temperature
variance and turbulent kinetic energy. An additional analysis of the leading
Lyapunov vector field for the full turbulent flow trajectory in its
high-dimensional phase space demonstrates that turbulent flow modes at a
certain scale continue to give rise locally to modes with longer wavelength in
the turbulent case. As a consequence successively larger convection patterns
grow until the horizontal extension of the layer is reached. This instability
mechanism, which is known to exist near the onset of constant heat flux-driven
convection, is shown here to persist into the fully developed turbulent flow
regime thus connecting weakly nonlinear pattern formation with the one in fully
developed turbulence. We discuss possible implications of our study for
observed, but not yet consistently numerically reproducible, solar
supergranulation which could lead to improved simulation models of surface

components of a cloud service infrastructure. Such an LB uses network and
transport layer information for deciding how to distribute client requests
across a group of servers. A crucial requirement for a stateful LB is per
connection consistency (PCC); namely, that all the packets of the same
connection will be forwarded to the same server, as long as the server is
alive, even if the pool of servers or the assignment function changes. The
challenge is in designing a high throughput, low latency solution that is also
scalable. This paper proposes a highly scalable LB, called Prism, implemented
using a programmable switch ASIC. As far as we know, Prism is the first
reported LB that can process millions of connections per second and hundreds of
millions connections in total, while ensuring PCC. This is due to the fact that
Prism forwards all the packets in hardware, even during server pool changes,
while avoiding the need to maintain a hardware state per every active
connection. We implemented a prototype of the proposed architecture and showed
that Prism can scale to 100 million simultaneous connections, and can
accommodate more than one pool update per second.

utilize CNN-RNN or 3D CNN to extract the spatial-temporal features from
different facial units, instead of concentrating on a certain region during
expression variation capturing, which leads to limited performance in FER. In
our paper, we introduce a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) layer into a common

learn more significant facial expression features which concentrate on certain
regions after sharing information between extracted CNN features of nodes.
Then, a LSTM layer is applied to learn long-term dependencies among the GCN
learned features to model the variation. In addition, a weight assignment
mechanism is also designed to weight the output of different nodes for final
classification by characterizing the expression intensities in each frame. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to use GCN in FER task. We

weather around the epicenter in theory. In order to figure out the weather
conditions around the epicenter before earthquakes, 213 global earthquake
events with magnitude of 6 or above from 2013 to 2020 were collected. Based on

weather before the earthquake is fair. Besides, the fair state before the

devices, which plays an essential role in many Internet applications. In this
field, a long-standing challenge is how to find a large number of
highly-reliable landmarks, which is the key to improve the precision of IP
geolocation. To this end, many efforts have been made, while many IP
geolocation methods still suffer from unacceptable error distance because of
the lack of landmarks. In this paper, we propose a novel IP geolocation system,
named XLBoost-Geo, which focuses on enhancing the number and the density of
highly reliable landmarks. The main idea is to extract location-indicating
clues from web pages and locating the web servers based on the clues. Based on
the landmarks, XLBoost-Geo is able to geolocate arbitrary IPs with little error
distance. Specifically, we first design an entity extracting method based on a
bidirectional LSTM neural network with a self-adaptive loss function (LSTM-Ada)
to extract the location-indicating clues on web pages and then generate
landmarks based on the clues. Then, by measurements on network latency and
topology, we estimate the closest landmark and associate the coordinate of the
landmark with the location of the target IP. The results of our experiments
clearly validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the extracting method, the
precision, number, coverage of the landmarks, and the precision of the IP
geolocation. On RIPE Atlas nodes, XLBoost-Geo achieves 2,561m median error
distance, which outperforms SLG and IPIP.

elements and methodologies from various fields, such as optimization, decision
analysis, risk management, data science, forecasting, etc. The modeling and
treatment of deep uncertainties for future asset returns is a major issue for
the success of analytical portfolio selection models. Recently, robust
optimization (RO) models have attracted a lot of interest in this area. RO
provides a computationally tractable framework for portfolio optimization based
on relatively general assumptions on the probability distributions of the
uncertain risk parameters. Thus, RO extends the framework of traditional linear
and non-linear models (e.g., the well-known mean-variance model), incorporating
uncertainty through a formal and analytical approach into the modeling process.
Robust counterparts of existing models can be considered as worst-case
re-formulations as far as deviations of the uncertain parameters from their
nominal values are concerned. Although several RO models have been proposed in
the literature focusing on various risk measures and different types of
uncertainty sets about asset returns, analytical empirical assessments of their
performance have not been performed in a comprehensive manner. The objective of
this study is to fill in this gap in the literature. More specifically, we
consider different types of RO models based on popular risk measures and
conduct an extensive comparative analysis of their performance using data from
the US market during the period 2005-2016.

measuring the diffusion constant of the vortex bundle after the macroscopic

generalize and might give sub-optimal results as the environment gets complex.
Whereas, using reinforcement learning, optimal driving policy could be learned

However, current research in the field of reinforcement learning for autonomous
driving is mainly focused on highway setup with little to no emphasis on urban
environments. In this work, a deep reinforcement learning based decision-making
approach for high-level driving behavior is proposed for urban environments in
the presence of pedestrians. For this, the use of Deep Recurrent Q-Network
(DRQN) is explored, a method combining state-of-the art Deep Q-Network (DQN)
with a long term short term memory (LSTM) layer helping the agent gain a memory
of the environment. A 3-D state representation is designed as the input
combined with a well defined reward function to train the agent for learning an
appropriate behavior policy in a real-world like urban simulator. The proposed
method is evaluated for dense urban scenarios and compared with a rule-based
approach and results show that the proposed DRQN based driving behavior

specially designed for performing piecewise mapping, taking nonlinear
adjustment and differentiability into account. To cope with challenging and
diverse illumination properties in real-world images, FlexiCurve is formulated
as a multi-task framework to produce diverse estimations and the associated
confidence maps. These estimations are adaptively fused to improve local
enhancements of different regions. Thanks to the image-to-curve formulation,
for an image with a size of 512*512*3, FlexiCurve only needs a lightweight

increasing attention in recent years but remains challenging, due to the
intrinsic difficulty in identifying overlapping relations with shared entities.
Prior works show that joint learning can result in a noticeable performance
gain. However, they usually involve sequential interrelated steps and suffer
from the problem of exposure bias. At training time, they predict with the
ground truth conditions while at inference it has to make extraction from
scratch. This discrepancy leads to error accumulation. To mitigate the issue,
we propose in this paper a one-stage joint extraction model, namely, TPLinker,
which is capable of discovering overlapping relations sharing one or both
entities while immune from the exposure bias. TPLinker formulates joint

to be estimated from available process data and is often thought of as a
prerequisite for the physical interpretability of a model. Nevertheless, model
identifiability may be challenging to obtain in practice due to both stochastic
and deterministic uncertainties, e.g. low data variability, noisy measurements,
erroneous model structure, and stochasticity and locality of the optimization
algorithm. For gray-box, hybrid models, model identifiability is rarely
obtainable due to a high number of parameters. We illustrate through an
industrial case study - modeling of a production choke valve in a petroleum
well - that physical interpretability may be preserved even for
non-identifiable models with adequate parameter regularization in the
estimation problem. To this end, in a real industrial scenario, it may be
beneficial for the model's predictive performance to develop hybrid over
mechanistic models, as the model flexibility is higher. Modeling of six
petroleum wells on the asset Edvard Grieg using historical production data show
a 35\% reduction in the median prediction error across the wells comparing a
hybrid to a mechanistic model. On the other hand, both the predictive
performance and physical interpretability of the developed models are
influenced by the available data. The findings encourage research into online
learning and other hybrid model variants to improve the results.

multiport active network. This is an important engineering problem as networks
designed differ in parameter values due to tolerance during manufacture from
their actual realizations in chips and hardware. Parameters also undergo
changes due to environmental factors. Hence, practical use of networks requires
compensation which is only possible by connecting compensating network at the
ports. The resulting interconnection is then required to be stable over a range
of parameter values. This is called robust compensation. This paper formulates
such a problem using an extension of the coprime factorization theory well
known in feedback control theory to the situation of multiport network
interconnection developed in \cite{msm1} and formulates the robust
stabilization problem as an $H_{\infty}$ optimization problem. The port
interconnection of networks does not confirm with computation of the function
of the interconnected network analogous to that of the feedback interconnection
using signal flow graph. Hence the well known stabilization and stability
theory of feedback systems cannot be utilized for such a problem. A new
formulation of stabilization theory of network interconnection was formulated
and developed by the authors in \cite{msm1}. The variations of parameters of
the network are used to define a worst case neighborhood of the network in
terms of its coprime fractions at the nominal values of parameters. The
solution of the optimization problem is then carried out by the standard
procedure of converting such a problem to the Nehari optimization problem
\cite{fran}. This methodology of solving the robust compensation of multiport
networks using feedback control theory is believed to be novel.

Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) produced in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC, since

understand the primordial heavy-quark production in vacuum, and to disentangle
hot from cold nuclear matter effects. Moreover, observations of collective
effects in high-multiplicity pp and p-Pb collisions show surprising
similarities with those in heavy-ion collisions. Heavy-flavour production in
such collisions could give further insight into the underlying processes. The
heavy-flavour production can be studied with $\rm e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs from
correlated semileptonic decays of heavy-flavour hadrons. Compared to single
heavy-flavour measurements, the dielectron yield contains information about the
initial kinematical correlations between the charm and anti-charm quarks, which
is otherwise not accessible, and is sensitive to soft heavy-flavour production.
We report results on correlated $\rm e^{+}e^{-}$ pairs in pp collisions

of heavy quarks is discussed by comparing the yield of dielectrons from
heavy-flavour hadron decays as a function of invariant mass, pair transverse
momentum and distance of closest approach to the primary vertex with different
Monte Carlo event generators. The heavy-flavour production cross sections are

open-source solutions must be found to enable new communities of developers to

algorithms based on deep learning and convolutional neural networks is the
annotation of a sufficient number of images to achieve competitive performance.
This is particularly difficult for semantic segmentation tasks since the
annotation must be ideally generated at the pixel level. Weakly-supervised
semantic segmentation aims at reducing this cost by employing simpler
annotations that, hence, are easier, cheaper and quicker to produce. In this
paper, we propose and assess a new weakly-supervised semantic segmentation
approach making use of a novel loss function whose goal is to counteract the
effects of weak annotations. To this end, this loss function comprises several
terms based on partial cross-entropy losses, being one of them the Centroid
Loss. This term induces a clustering of the image pixels in the object classes
under consideration, whose aim is to improve the training of the segmentation
network by guiding the optimization. The performance of the approach is
evaluated against datasets from two different industry-related case studies:
while one involves the detection of instances of a number of different object
classes in the context of a quality control application, the other stems from
the visual inspection domain and deals with the localization of images areas
whose pixels correspond to scene surface points affected by a specific sort of
defect. The detection results that are reported for both cases show that,
despite the differences among them and the particular challenges, the use of
weak annotations do not prevent from achieving a competitive performance level

discrete representation is not only a simple symbolic identifier for the
topological structure of complex flows, but it also gives rise to a new
methodology of topological data analysis for flows when applied to data brought
by measurements, experiments, and numerical simulations of complex flows. As a
proof of concept, we provide some applications of the representation theory to
2D compressible vector fields and a 3D vector field arising in an industrial

time-consuming. To deal with this limitation, several simulation platforms have

a limited realism in terms of appearance and physical dynamics, leading to
navigation policies that do not generalize in the real world.
  In this paper, we propose a tool based on the Habitat simulator which
exploits real world images of the environment, together with sensor and
actuator noise models, to produce more realistic navigation episodes. We
perform a range of experiments to assess the ability of such policies to
generalize using virtual and real-world images, as well as observations
transformed with unsupervised domain adaptation approaches. We also assess the
impact of sensor and actuation noise on the navigation performance and
investigate whether it allows to learn more robust navigation policies. We show
that our tool can effectively help to train and evaluate navigation policies on
real-world observations without running navigation pisodes in the real world.

near the absolute critical gradient, the physics of which is included through
direct solution of the gyrokinetic equation. Our method, which handles general

quantum metrology and the foundations of quantum mechanics. The major models to
realize the spin squeezing are the one- and two-axis twisting models. Here, we
consider a collective spin system coupled to a bosonic field, and show that
proper constant-value controls in this model can simulate the dynamical
behaviors of these two models. More interestingly, a better performance of
squeezing can be obtained when the control is time-varying, which is generated
via a reinforcement learning algorithm. However, this advantage becomes limited
if the collective noise is involved. To deal with it, we propose a four-step
strategy for the construction of a new type of combined controls, which include
both constant-value and time-varying controls, but performed at different time
intervals. Compared to the full time-varying controls, the combined controls
not only give a comparable minimum value of the squeezing parameter over time,
but also provides a better lifetime and larger full amount of squeezing.
Moreover, the amplitude form of a combined control is simpler and more stable
than the full time-varying control. Therefore, our scheme is very promising to
be applied in practice to improve the generation and storage performance of
squeezing.

mode decomposition (EMD)-like tool to enhance the time-frequency resolution and
energy concentration of a multi-component non-stationary signal and provides
more accurate component recovery. To recover individual components, the SST
method consists of two steps. First the instantaneous frequency (IF) of a
component is estimated from the SST plane. Secondly, after IF is recovered, the
associated component is computed by a definite integral along the estimated IF
curve on the SST plane. The reconstruction accuracy for a component depends
heavily on the accuracy of the IFs estimation carried out in the first step.
More recently, a direct method of the time-frequency approach, called signal
separation operation (SSO), was introduced for multi-component signal
separation. While both SST and SSO are mathematically rigorous on IF
estimation, SSO avoids the second step of the two-step SST method in component
recovery (mode retrieval). The SSO method is based on some variant of the
short-time Fourier transform. In the present paper, we propose a direct method
of signal separation based on the adaptive continuous wavelet-like transform
(CWLT) by introducing two models of the adaptive CWLT-based approach for signal
separation: the sinusoidal signal-based model and the linear chirp-based model,
which are derived respectively from sinusoidal signal approximation and the
linear chirp approximation at any time instant. A more accurate component
recovery formula is derived from linear chirp local approximation. We present
the theoretical analysis of our approach. For each model, we establish the

spread of location-based services (LBSs). Many methods to protect location
privacy have been proposed in the past decades. Especially, perturbation
methods based on Geo-Indistinguishability (Geo-I), which randomly perturb a
true location to a pseudolocation, are getting attention due to its strong
privacy guarantee inherited from differential privacy. However, Geo-I is based
on the Euclidean plane even though many LBSs are based on road networks (e.g.
ride-sharing services). This causes unnecessary noise and thus an insufficient
tradeoff between utility and privacy for LBSs on road networks. To address this
issue, we propose a new privacy notion, Geo-Graph-Indistinguishability (GG-I),
for locations on a road network to achieve a better tradeoff. We propose
Graph-Exponential Mechanism (GEM), which satisfies GG-I. Moreover, we formalize
the optimization problem to find the optimal GEM in terms of the tradeoff.
However, the computational complexity of a naive method to find the optimal
solution is prohibitive, so we propose a greedy algorithm to find an
approximate solution in an acceptable amount of time. Finally, our experiments

  Network Metamodeling",,,,,"stat.ME stat.CO stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Bayesian calibration is theoretically superior to standard
direct-search algorithm because it can reveal the full joint posterior
distribution of the calibrated parameters. However, to date, Bayesian
calibration has not been used often in health decision sciences due to
practical and computational burdens. In this paper we propose to use artificial
neural networks (ANN) as one solution to these limitations.
  Methods: Bayesian Calibration using Artificial Neural Networks (BayCANN)
involves (1) training an ANN metamodel on a sample of model inputs and outputs,
and (2) then calibrating the trained ANN metamodel instead of the full model in
a probabilistic programming language to obtain the posterior joint distribution
of the calibrated parameters. We demonstrate BayCANN by calibrating a natural
history model of colorectal cancer to adenoma prevalence and cancer incidence
data. In addition, we compare the efficiency and accuracy of BayCANN against
performing a Bayesian calibration directly on the simulation model using an
incremental mixture importance sampling (IMIS) algorithm.
  Results: BayCANN was generally more accurate than IMIS in recovering the
""true"" parameter values. The ratio of the absolute ANN deviation from the truth
compared to IMIS for eight out of the nine calibrated parameters were less than
one indicating that BayCANN was more accurate than IMIS. In addition, BayCANN
took about 15 minutes total compared to the IMIS method which took 80 minutes.
  Conclusions: In our case study, BayCANN was more accurate than IMIS and was
five-folds faster. Because BayCANN does not depend on the structure of the
simulation model, it can be adapted to models of various levels of complexity
with minor changes to its structure. We provide BayCANN's open-source
implementation in R.

support systems for the computer aided diagnosis of skin lesions. Although deep
learning-based approaches have improved segmentation performance, these models
are often susceptible to class imbalance in the data, particularly, the
fraction of the image occupied by the background healthy skin. Despite
variations of the popular Dice loss function being proposed to tackle the class
imbalance problem, the Dice loss formulation does not penalize
misclassifications of the background pixels. We propose a novel metric-based
loss function using the Matthews correlation coefficient, a metric that has
been shown to be efficient in scenarios with skewed class distributions, and
use it to optimize deep segmentation models. Evaluations on three skin lesion
image datasets: the ISBI ISIC 2017 Skin Lesion Segmentation Challenge dataset,
the DermoFit Image Library, and the PH2 dataset, show that models trained using
the proposed loss function outperform those trained using Dice loss by 11.25%,
4.87%, and 0.76% respectively in the mean Jaccard index. The code is available

that the challenge baseline system generates fake X-vectors which are very

speakers in the anonymization process, causing a loss of information. We
propose a new method to generate fake X-vectors which overcomes these

intra-similarity. We use population data to learn the properties of the
X-vector space, before fitting a generative model which we use to sample fake
X-vectors. We show how this approach generates X-vectors that more closely
follow the expected intra-similarity distribution of organic speaker X-vectors.
Our method can be easily integrated with others as the anonymization component
of the system and removes the need to distribute a pool of speakers to use
during the anonymization. Our approach leads to an increase in EER of up to
$19.4\%$ in males and $11.1\%$ in females in scenarios where enrollment and

decrease of the integration of visual processing and working memory areas in
the beta band. Notably, only brain network properties in multilayer network
correlated with future BCI scores in the alpha2 band: positively in

a program, called mutants. At industrial systems the scale and size of
Facebook's, doing this is infeasible. We should not create mutants that the
test suite would likely fail on or that give no actionable signal to
developers. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we semi-automatically learn
error-inducing patterns from a corpus of common Java coding errors and from
changes that caused operational anomalies at Facebook specifically. We combine
the mutations with instrumentation that measures which tests exactly visited
the mutated piece of code. Results on more than 15,000 generated mutants show
that more than half of the generated mutants survive Facebook's rigorous test
suite of unit, integration, and system tests. Moreover, in a case study with 26
developers, all but two found information of automatically detected test holes
interesting in principle. As such, almost half of the 26 would actually act on
the mutant presented to them by adapting an existing or creating a new test.
The others did not for a variety of reasons often outside the scope of mutation
testing. It remains a practical challenge how we can include such external
information to increase the true actionability rate on mutants.

to study the dynamics within social, technological,or natural systems. An often
observed common goal there is to optimize these systems for specific purposes
by minimizing certain costs while maximizing a desired output. Acknowledging
that especially real-world systems from the coupled socio-ecological realm are
highly intertwined this work exemplifies that in such systems the optimization
of a certain subsystem, e.g., to increase the resilience against external
pressure in an ecological network, may unexpectedly diminish the stability of
the whole coupled system. For this purpose we utilize an adaptation of a
previously proposed conceptual bilayer network model composed of an ecological
network of diffusively coupled resources co-evolving with a social network of
interacting agents that harvest these resources and learn each other's
strategies depending on individual success. We derive an optimal coupling
strength that prevents a collapse in as many resources as possible if one
assumes that the agents' strategies remain constant over time. However, we then
show that if agents socially learn and adapt strategies according to their
neighbors' success, this optimal coupling strength is revealed to be a critical
parameter above which the probability for a global collapse in terms of
irreversibly depleted resources is high -- an effect that we denote the tragedy
of the optimizer. We thus find that measures which stabilize the dynamics
within a certain part of a larger co-evolutionary system may unexpectedly cause
the emergence of novel undesired globally stable states. Our results therefore
underline the importance of holistic approaches for managing socio-ecological
systems because stabilizing effects which focus on single subsystems may be
counter-beneficial for the system as a whole.

Functionals (MFs) of pixellated jet images. The MFs are geometric measures of

multiplicity, which is an important quantity in jet tagging. Their changes by
dilation encode the jet constituents' geometric structures that appear at
various angular scales. We explicitly show that this analysis using the MFs
together with mathematical morphology can be considered a constrained
convolutional neural network (CNN). Conversely, CNN could model the MFs in a
certain limit, and we show their correlation in the example of tagging
semi-visible jets emerging from the strong interaction of a hidden valley
scenario. The MFs are independent of the IRC-safe observables commonly used in
jet physics. We combine this morphological analysis with an IRC-safe relation
network which models two-point energy correlations. While the resulting network
uses constrained input parameters, it shows comparable dark jet and top jet
tagging performances to the CNN. The architecture has significant computational
advantages when the available data is limited. We show that its tagging
performance is much better than that of the CNN with a small number of training

well a deep reinforced learning algorithm ACKTR and dynamic programming solve a
relatively simple life cycle model. To analyze results, we use a selection of
statistics and also compare the resulting optimal employment choices at various
states. The statistics demonstrate that ACKTR yields almost as good results as
dynamic programming. Qualitatively, dynamic programming yields more spiked
aggregate employment profiles than ACKTR. The results obtained with ACKTR
provide a good, yet not perfect, approximation to the results of dynamic
programming. In addition to the baseline case, we analyze two social security
reforms: (1) an increase of retirement age, and (2) universal basic income. Our
results suggest that reinforced learning algorithms can be of significant value
in developing social security reforms.

models of quantum gravity corrected black holes are available. In loop quantum
gravity (LQG) models were presented, which resolve the classical singularity in
the centre of the black hole by means of a black-to-white hole transition, but
neglect the collapse process. The situation is similar in other quantum gravity
approaches, where eternal non-singular models are available. In this paper, a
strategy is presented to generalise these eternal models to dynamical collapse
models by surface matching. Assuming 1) the validity of a static quantum black
hole spacetime outside the collapsing matter, 2) homogeneity of the collapsing
matter, and 3) differentiability at the surface of the matter fixes the
dynamics of the spacetime uniquely. It is argued that these assumptions
resemble a collapse of pressure-less dust and thus generalises the
Oppenheimer-Snyder-Datt model, although no precise model of the matter has to
be assumed. Hawking radiation is systematically neglected in this approach. The
junction conditions and the spacetime dynamics are discussed generically for
bouncing black hole spacetimes, as proposed by LQG, although the scheme is
approach independent. Further, the equations are explicitly solved for the
recent model [1] and a global spacetime picture of the collapse is achieved.
The causal structure is discussed in detail and the Penrose diagram is
constructed. The trajectory of the collapsing matter is completely constructed
from an inside and outside observer point of view. The general analysis shows
that the matter is collapsing and re-expanding and crosses the Penrose diagram
diagonally. This way the infinite tower of Penrose diagrams, as proposed by
several LQG models, is generically not cut out. Questions about different
timescales of the collapse for in- and outside observers can be answered.

overcome this challenge, we propose fast deep learning (DL)-aided SD (FDL-SD)

application of DL is to generate a highly reliable initial candidate to
accelerate the search in SD and KSD in conjunction with candidate/layer
ordering and early rejection. Compared to existing DL-aided SD schemes, our
proposed schemes are more advantageous in both offline training and online
application phases. Specifically, unlike existing DL-aided SD schemes, they do
not require performing the conventional SD in the training phase. For a $24

reduction of more than $90\%$ without any performance loss compared to
conventional SD schemes. For a $32 \times 32$ MIMO system with QPSK, the
proposed FDL-KSD only requires $K = 32$ to attain the performance of the
conventional KSD with $K=256$, where $K$ is the number of survival paths in
KSD. This implies a dramatic improvement in the performance--complexity

fermions and the strong magnetic field. We show that the di-lepton spectrum
becomes anisotropic with respect to the magnetic-field direction and depends on
the photon polarization as a manifestation of the vacuum dichroism in a strong
magnetic field. According to the energy conservation in the presence of the
Landau quantization, not only the transverse momentum of the produced fermions
but also the longitudinal momentum is discretized, and the di-lepton spectrum
exhibits spike structures as functions of the incident photon energy and the
magnetic field strength. We also show that the di-lepton production is strictly
prohibited for massless fermions in the lowest Landau levels as an analogue of
the so-called helicity suppression.

impact of the discriminatory bias has attracted attention. In recent years,
various methods to mitigate the bias have been proposed. However, most of them
have not considered intersectional bias, which brings unfair situations where
people belonging to specific subgroups of a protected group are treated worse
when multiple sensitive attributes are taken into consideration. To mitigate
this bias, in this paper, we propose a method called One-vs.-One Mitigation by
applying a process of comparison between each pair of subgroups related to
sensitive attributes to the fairness-aware machine learning for binary
classification. We compare our method and the conventional fairness-aware
binary classification methods in comprehensive settings using three approaches
(pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing), six metrics (the ratio
and difference of demographic parity, equalized odds, and equal opportunity),
and two real-world datasets (Adult and COMPAS). As a result, our method
mitigates the intersectional bias much better than conventional methods in all
the settings. With the result, we open up the potential of fairness-aware
binary classification for solving more realistic problems occurring when there
are multiple sensitive attributes.

the existence and great empirical success of metric-sensitive losses, i.e.
relaxations of these metrics such as soft Dice, soft Jaccard and
Lovasz-Softmax, many researchers still use per-pixel losses, such as (weighted)
cross-entropy to train CNNs for segmentation. Therefore, the target metric is
in many cases not directly optimized. We investigate from a theoretical
perspective, the relation within the group of metric-sensitive loss functions
and question the existence of an optimal weighting scheme for weighted
cross-entropy to optimize the Dice score and Jaccard index at test time. We
find that the Dice score and Jaccard index approximate each other relatively

when deviating from the trivial weight setting where soft Tversky equals soft
Dice. We verify these results empirically in an extensive validation on six
medical segmentation tasks and can confirm that metric-sensitive losses are
superior to cross-entropy based loss functions in case of evaluation with Dice
Score or Jaccard Index. This further holds in a multi-class setting, and across
different object sizes and foreground/background ratios. These results
encourage a wider adoption of metric-sensitive loss functions for medical

Search (NAS) has been applied with remarkable success to various high-level
vision tasks such as classification and semantic segmentation. The underlying
idea for the NAS algorithm is straightforward, namely, to enable the network
the ability to choose among a set of operations (e.g., convolution with
different filter sizes), one is able to find an optimal architecture that is
better adapted to the problem at hand. However, so far the success of NAS has
not been enjoyed by low-level geometric vision tasks such as stereo matching.
This is partly due to the fact that state-of-the-art deep stereo matching
networks, designed by humans, are already sheer in size. Directly applying the
NAS to such massive structures is computationally prohibitive based on the
currently available mainstream computing resources. In this paper, we propose
the first end-to-end hierarchical NAS framework for deep stereo matching by
incorporating task-specific human knowledge into the neural architecture search
framework. Specifically, following the gold standard pipeline for deep stereo
matching (i.e., feature extraction -- feature volume construction and dense
matching), we optimize the architectures of the entire pipeline jointly.
Extensive experiments show that our searched network outperforms all
state-of-the-art deep stereo matching architectures and is ranked at the top 1
accuracy on KITTI stereo 2012, 2015 and Middlebury benchmarks, as well as the
top 1 on SceneFlow dataset with a substantial improvement on the size of the

First, to provide modeling and description of optical spectra for various
single- and bi-phase oxyhydride compositions, and second, to conduct
comparative analysis that would be powerful enough to explain the features of
the experimentally measured transmittance spectra. In the context of nonlinear
optics, for the P-43m noncentrosymmetric cubic structure of Y4H10O we evaluated

estimate the significance of the B-field over the G-force. The B-field in Hub-N
shows a uniform structure along the E-W orientation, perpendicular to the major
axis of the hub-filament system. The I-gradient in Hub-N displays a local
minimum coinciding with the dust core MM1a detected with interferometric
observations. The B-field orientation is perturbed when approaching the dust
core. Hub-S shows 2 local minima, reflecting the bimodal distribution of the
B-field. In Hub-N, both E and W of the hub-filament system, the I-gradient and
the B-field are parallel whereas they tend to be perpendicular when penetrating
the filaments and hub. The analysis of the {\delta}- and {\Sigma} B-maps
indicate that, the B-field cannot prevent the collapse, suggesting that the
B-field is initially dragged by the infalling motion and aligned with it, or is
channeling material toward the central ridge from both sides. Values of
{\Sigma} B > 1 are found toward a N-S ridge encompassing the dust emission
peak, indicating that in this region B-field dominates over G-force, or that
with the current angular resolution we cannot resolve an hypothetical more
complex structure. We estimated the B-field strength, the MtF ratio and the A-M
number, and found differences between the 2 hubs. The different levels of
fragmentation observed in these 2 hubs could arise from the differences in the
B-field properties rather than from different intensity of the G-field.

to holographic telepresence and tactile communications. One crucial and pivotal
prospect of 6G is worldwide connectivity. Today, nearly 4 billion people do not
have access to an internet connection. 6G not only intends to hyper-connect the
already connected, but to bridge the digital divide by connecting the
unconnected. For that purpose, 6G architectures will integrate airborne
communications as they are considered key enablers for the next generation of
wireless systems. Airborne communications can be done via free-flying platforms
and tethered flying platforms. Free-flying platforms, such as unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) and high-altitude platforms (HAPs) have received great interest
during the last decade. However, they lack endurance and backhaul capacity.
Networked Tethered Flying Platforms (NTFPs), on the other hand, are enjoying
the benefits of free-flying platforms while overcoming their limitations by
providing a continuous supply of power and data via the tether. They are also
cost-efficient and have good green credentials. Tether platforms have a wide
range of applications beyond communications, such as energy harvesting,
entertainment, science, research, public safety, disaster relief, government,

evolved into powerful tools to investigate photonic nanostructures with an
unrivaled combination of spatial and spectral precision through the analysis of

with ultrafast optics, the emerging field of ultrafast electron microscopy
utilizes synchronized femtosecond electron and light pulses that are aimed at
the sampled structures, holding the promise to bring simultaneous
sub-Angstrom--sub-fs--sub-meV space-time-energy resolution to the study of
material and optical-field dynamics. In addition, these advances enable the
manipulation of the wave function of individual free electrons in unprecedented
ways, opening sound prospects to probe and control quantum excitations at the
nanoscale. Here, we provide an overview of photonics research based on free
electrons, supplemented by original theoretical insights, and discussion of
challenges and opportunities. In particular, we show that the excitation
probability by a single electron is independent of its wave function, apart
from a classical average over the transverse beam density profile, whereas the
probability for two or more modulated electrons depends on their relative
spatial arrangement, thus reflecting the quantum nature of their interactions.
We derive first-principles analytical expressions that embody these results and
have general validity for arbitrarily shaped electrons and any type of
electron-sample interaction. We conclude with perspectives on various exciting
directions for disruptive approaches to non-invasive spectroscopy and
microscopy, the possibility of sampling the nonlinear optical response at the
nanoscale, the manipulation of the density matrices associated with free
electrons and optical sample modes, and applications in optical modulation of
electron beams.

Ultimately, the new findings may open doors for pure spin-based information and
communication technologies. The aim is to replace moving charges with dynamical
entities that utilize low-dissipation coherent and incoherent spin excitations
in antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic insulators. The ambition is that the new
pure spin-based system will suffer reduced energy losses and operate at high
frequencies. In magnetic insulators, there are no mobile charge carriers that
can dissipate energy. Integration with conventional electronics is possible via
interface exchange interactions and spin-orbit couplings. In this way, the free
electrons in the metals couple to the localized spins in the magnetic
insulators. In turn, these links facilitate spin-transfer torques and
spin-orbit torques across metal-insulator interfaces and the associated
phenomena of spin-pumping and charge-pumping. The interface couplings also
connect the electron motion inside the metals with the spin fluctuations inside
the magnetic insulators. These features imply that the system can enable
unprecedented control of correlations resulting from the electron-magnon
interactions. We review recent developments to realize electric and thermal
generation, manipulation, detection, and control of pure spin information in

a bilevel optimization problem. While research on bilevel optimization of
neural networks has been dominated by implicit differentiation and unrolling,
hypernetworks such as Self-Tuning Networks (STNs) have recently gained traction
due to their ability to amortize the optimization of the inner objective. In
this paper, we diagnose several subtle pathologies in the training of STNs.
Based on these observations, we propose the $\Delta$-STN, an improved
hypernetwork architecture which stabilizes training and optimizes
hyperparameters much more efficiently than STNs. The key idea is to focus on
accurately approximating the best-response Jacobian rather than the full
best-response function; we achieve this by reparameterizing the hypernetwork
and linearizing the network around the current parameters. We demonstrate
empirically that our $\Delta$-STN can tune regularization hyperparameters (e.g.
weight decay, dropout, number of cutout holes) with higher accuracy, faster
convergence, and improved stability compared to existing approaches.

different possible syllabifications for each verse, with different likelihoods;
metric constraints relative to accents on the 10th, 4th and 6th syllables are

required to read-out the entire TileCal detector. Each ROD module has to
process the data from up to 360 PMTs in real time in less than 10 microseconds.
The commissioning of the RODs was completed in 2008 before the first LHC

and exploit the long-time statistical CSI to design the phase shifts of the
RIS, while the maximum ratio combination (MRC) technique is applied for the
active beamforming at the base station (BS) relying on the instantaneous CSI.
Firstly, we reveal the power scaling laws and derive the closed-form
expressions for the uplink achievable rate which holds for arbitrary numbers of
base station (BS) antennas. Based on the theoretical expressions, we discuss
the rate performance under some special cases and provide the average
asymptotic rate when using random phase shifts. Then, we consider the sum-rate

phase shifts at the RIS. However, these two optimization problems are
challenging to solve due to the complicated data rate expression. To solve
these problems, we propose a novel genetic algorithm (GA) with low complexity

extract these key dynamics parameters from noisy experimental data. Here, we
employ the normalized Shannon entropy to quantify the deviation of cell

e.g., for factory and process automation, move closer and closer to the
Internet, mandating secure communication. However, securely setting up OPC UA,
the prime candidate for secure industrial communication, is challenging due to
a large variety of insecure options. To study whether Internet-facing OPC UA
appliances are configured securely, we actively scan the IPv4 address space for
publicly reachable OPC UA systems and assess the security of their
configurations. We observe problematic security configurations such as missing
access control (on 24% of hosts), disabled security functionality (24%), or use
of deprecated cryptographic primitives (25%) on in total 92% of the reachable
deployments. Furthermore, we discover several hundred devices in multiple
autonomous systems sharing the same security certificate, opening the door for
impersonation attacks. Overall, in this paper, we highlight commonly found
security misconfigurations and underline the importance of appropriate
configuration for security-featuring protocols.

shoot videos and upload them to the Internet. These videos mostly contain a
carefully-edited background audio track, where serious speech change, pitch
shifting and various types of audio effects may involve, and existing audio
identification systems may fail to recognize the audio. To solve this problem,
in this paper, we introduce the idea of contrastive learning to the task of
audio fingerprinting (AFP). Contrastive learning is an unsupervised approach to
learn representations that can effectively group similar samples and
discriminate dissimilar ones. In our work, we consider an audio track and its
differently distorted versions as similar while considering different audio
tracks as dissimilar. Based on the momentum contrast (MoCo) framework, we
devise a contrastive learning method for AFP, which can generate fingerprints
that are both discriminative and robust. A set of experiments showed that our
AFP method is effective for audio identification, with robustness to serious
audio distortions, including the challenging speed change and pitch shifting.

orders of magnitude stronger than the mean dissipation rate. Despite its
importance in many small-scale physical processes, there is presently no
accurate theory or model for predicting the extrema as a function of the
Reynolds number. Here, we introduce a new model for the dissipation PDF based
on the concept of significant shear layers, which are thin regions of elevated
local mean dissipation. At very high Reynolds numbers these significant shear
layers develop layered substructures. The flow domain is divided into the
different layer regions and a background region, each with their own PDF of
dissipation. The volume weighted regional PDFs are combined to obtain the
overall PDF, which is subsequently used to determine the dissipation variance
and maximum. The model yields Reynolds number scalings for the dissipation
maximum and variance, which are in agreement with the available data. Moreover,
the power law scaling exponent is found to increase gradually with the Reynolds
number, which is also consistent with the data. The increasing exponent is
shown to have profound implications for turbulence at atmospheric and
astrophysical Reynolds numbers. The present results strongly suggest that
intermittent significant shear layer structures are key to understanding and
quantifying the dissipation extremes, and, more generally, extreme velocity
gradients.

order to study grain size influence and grain boundary trapping during
permeation, two modelling approaches are explored; a 1D Finite Element model
including trap density and binding energy as input parameters and a
polycrystalline model based on the assignment of a lower diffusivity and
solubility to the grain boundaries. Samples of pure iron after two different
heat treatments - 950C for 40 minutes and 1100C for 5 minutes - are tested
applying three consecutive rising permeation steps and three decaying steps.
Experimental results show that the finer grain microstructure promotes a
diffusion delay due to grain boundary trapping. The usual methodology for the
determination of trap densities and binding energies is revisited in which the
limiting diluted and saturated cases are considered. To this purpose, apparent
diffusivities are fitted including also the influence of boundary conditions
and comparing results provided by the constant concentration with the constant
flux assumption. Grain boundaries are characterised for pure iron with a
binding energy between 37.8 and 39.9 kJ/mol and a low trap density but it is
numerically demonstrated that saturated or diluted assumptions are not always
verified, and a univocal determination of trapping parameters requires a
broader range of charging conditions for permeation. The relationship between
surface parameters, i.e. charging current, recombination current and surface
concentrations, is also studied.

(square) vortex lattice phase with DPs, checkerboard phase, and stripe phase
with hidden vortices and antivortices. For given SOC and DDI strengths, the
system can display pentagonal vortex lattice with DPs, vortex necklace with
DPs, and exotic topological structure composed of multi-layer visible vortex
necklaces, a hidden giant vortex and hidden vortex necklaces, depending on the

than the nominal doping level. Precise measurements of Ge in the matrix provide
a view of the solubility diagram of Ge in AlGaN as a function of the Al mole

the solubility increases linearly with the Ga mole fraction in the ternary
alloy, which suggests that the Ge incorporation takes place by substitution of
Ga atoms only. The maximum percentage of Ga sites occupied by Ge saturates
around 1%. The solubility issues and Ge segregation phenomena at different

all the existing network embedding based methods are hard to capture the actual

low-dimensional space; meanwhile they cannot incorporate simultaneously network
structure information and node label information into network embedding. To
address the above problems, in this paper, we propose a novel Deep Kernel
Supervised Hashing (DKSH) method to learn the hashing representations of nodes

proposed to map nodes into suitable Hilbert space to deal with linearly

between two nodes, a novel similarity matrix is designed to merge both network
structure information and node label information. Supervised by the similarity
matrix, the learned hashing representations of nodes simultaneously preserve
the two kinds of information well from the learned Hilbert space. Extensive

Specifically, by exploiting the line-of-sight (LoS) link between nearby IRSs, a

consisting of suitable choices of input points in the function domain and their
function values, emulate the stationary points of the function, which can be

propose a general and effective algorithm for function optimization that
attempts to get closer to the true optima adaptively with in-built iterative

  electric field: a molecular dynamics study",,,,,"physics.bio-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The structure of DNA double helix is stabilized by metal counterions
condensed to a diffuse layer around the macromolecule. The dynamics of
counterions in real conditions is governed by the electric fields from DNA and
other biological macromolecules. In the present work the molecular dynamics
study {was} performed for the system of DNA double helix with neutralizing
K$^+$ counterions and for the system of KCl salt solution in the external
electric field of different strength (up to 32 mV/{\AA}). The analysis of ionic
conductivities of these systems {has shown} that the counterions around the DNA
double helix are slowed down compared with KCl salt solution. The calculated
{values of ion mobility} are within (0.05$\div$0.4) mS/cm depending on the
orientation of the external electric field relatively to the double helix.
Under the electric field parallel to the macromolecule K$^+$ counterions move
along the grooves of the double helix staying longer in the places with
narrower minor groove. Under the electric field perpendicular to the
macromolecule the dynamics of counterions is less affected by DNA atoms, and
starting with the electric field values about 30 mV/{\AA} the double helix
undergoes a phase transition from double-stranded to single-strand state.

18, 2018, 23:48 UT. No ground-based optical observations exist. Using the
satellite imagery of the dust trail left behind by the bolide, we tried to
reconstruct the bolide trajectory. In combination with the bolide speed
reported by the USGS, we computed the pre-atmospheric orbit. Observations in
various spectral bands from 0.4 to 13.3 microns enabled us to study the dust
properties. Images of the dust trail and its shadow obtained from various
angles by the MISR instrument on board the Terra satellite and geostationary
satellites Himawari-8 and GOES-17 were used. The initial position and
orientation of the trail was varied, and its projections into the geoid
coordinate grid were computed and compared with real data. Trail motion due to
atmospheric wind was taken into account. Radiances and reflectances of selected
parts of the dust trail were taken from the MODIS instrument. Reflectance
spectra were compared with asteroid spectra. The bolide radiant was found to be
13 +/- 9 degrees from that reported by the USGS, at azimuth 130\degr\ (from
south to west) and zenith distance 14\degr. The bolide position was confirmed,
including the height of maximum dust deposition around 25 km. The incoming
asteroid had to be quite strong to maintain a high speed down to this height.
The speed of 32 km/s, reported by the USGS, was found to be plausible. The
orbit had a high inclination of about 50\degr\ and a perihelion distance
between 0.95-1 AU. The semimajor axis could not be restricted well but was most
probably between 1-3 AU. The dust reflectance was much lower in the blue than
in the red, consistent with the material of A- or L-type asteroid. The
absorption at 11 microns confirms the presence of crystalline silicates in the
dust.

basic transporters of angular momentum. Without rotation, the sign of the

positive (negative) $B_\theta B_\phi$ transport the angular momentum poleward

Reynolds stresses start to dominate the transport of the angular momentum flux.
The simulations show that positive ratios of the two meridional magnetic field
components to the azimuthal field reduce the inward radial as well as the
equatorward latitudinal transport,%by the rotating magnetoconvection which
result from hydrodynamic calculations. Only for $B_\theta B_\phi>0$ (generated
by solar-type rotation laws with an accelerated equator) does the

stellar mass, and redshift of the observed samples. We produce absorption
measurements using Trident for UV transitions of C IV, O VI, Mg II and Si III.
The FIRE equivalent width (EW) distributions and covering fractions for the C
IV ion are broadly consistent with observations inside $0.5 R_{vir}$, but are
under-predicted for O VI, Mg II, and Si III. The absorption strengths of the
ions in the CGM are moderately correlated with the masses and star formation
activity of the galaxies. The correlation strengths increase with the
ionization potential of the ions. The structure and composition of the gas from
the simulations exhibit three zones around dwarf galaxies characterized by
distinct ion column densities: the disky ISM, the inner CGM (the wind-dominated
regime), and the outer CGM (the IGM accretion-dominated regime). We find that
the outer CGM in the simulations is nearly but not quite supported by thermal
pressure, so it is not in hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE), resulting in
halo-scale bulk inflow and outflow motions. The net gas inflow rates are
comparable to the SFR of the galaxy, but the bulk inflow and outflow rates are
greater by an order of magnitude, with velocities comparable to the virial
velocity of the halo. These roughly virial velocities (${\sim} 100 km s^{-1}$)
produce large EWs in the simulations. This supports a picture for dwarf
galaxies in which the dynamics of the CGM at large scales are coupled to the
small-scale star formation activity near the centre of their halos.

amounts of undirected offline experience data, while access to the online
environment is severely limited. In this work, we focus on this offline
setting. Our main insight is that, when presented with offline data composed of
a variety of behaviors, an effective way to leverage this data is to extract a
continuous space of recurring and temporally extended primitive behaviors
before using these primitives for downstream task learning. Primitives
extracted in this way serve two purposes: they delineate the behaviors that are
supported by the data from those that are not, making them useful for avoiding
distributional shift in offline RL; and they provide a degree of temporal
abstraction, which reduces the effective horizon yielding better learning in
theory, and improved offline RL in practice. In addition to benefiting offline
policy optimization, we show that performing offline primitive learning in this
way can also be leveraged for improving few-shot imitation learning as well as
exploration and transfer in online RL on a variety of benchmark domains.

phenomenon behind the folding of globular proteins. Globular proteins with a
single domain usually consist of about 30 to 100 amino acid residues, and this
finite size extends the transition interval of the coil-globule phase
transition. Based on the pedantic derivation of the two-state model, we
introduce the number of amino acid residues of a polypeptide chain as a
parameter in the expressions for two cooperativity measures and reveal their
physical significance. We conclude that the $k_2$ measure, related to the
degeneracy of the denatured state, describes the number of cooperative units
involved in the transition; additionally is found that the famous condition
$k_2=1$ is just the necessary condition to classify the protein as the
two-state folder. We also find that $\Omega_c$ is simply proportional to the
square of the transition interval. This fact allows us to perform the classical
size scaling analysis of the coil-globule phase transition. Moreover, these two
measures are shown to describe different characteristics of protein folding.

which can be solved numerically through the deterministic and stochastic
methods. Due to the complicated collision term of the Boltzmann equation, many
kinetic relaxation models have been proposed and used in the past seventy years
for the study of rarefied flow. In order to develop a multiscale method for the
rarefied and continuum flow simulation, by adopting the integral solution of
the kinetic model equation a DVM-type unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) has
been constructed. The UGKS models the gas dynamics on the cell size and time
step scales while the accumulating effect from particle transport and collision
has been taken into account within a time step. Under the UGKS framework, a
unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method has been further developed for
non-equilibrium flow simulation, where the time evolution of gas distribution
function is composed of analytical wave and individual particle. In the highly
rarefied regime, particle transport and collision will play a dominant role.
Due to the single relaxation time model for particle collision, there is a
noticeable discrepancy between the UGKWP solution and the full Boltzmann or
DSMC result, especially in the high Mach and Knudsen number cases. In this
paper, besides the kinetic relaxation model, a modification of particle
collision time according to the particle velocity will be implemented in UGKWP.
As a result, the new model greatly improves the performance of UGKWP in the
capturing of non-equilibrium flow. There is a perfect match between UGKWP and
DSMC or Boltzmann solution in the highly rarefied regime. In the near continuum
and continuum flow regime, the UGKWP will gradually get back to the macroscopic
variables based Navier-Stokes flow solver at small cell Knudsen number.

graph-structured data in databases and data science platforms. FPGAs as
accelerators for graph processing with a customizable memory hierarchy promise
solving performance problems caused by inherent irregular memory access
patterns on traditional hardware (e.g., CPU). However, developing such hardware
accelerators is yet time-consuming and difficult and benchmarking is
non-standardized, hindering comprehension of the impact of memory access
pattern changes and systematic engineering of graph processing accelerators.
  In this work, we propose a simulation environment for the analysis of graph
processing accelerators based on simulating their memory access patterns.
Further, we evaluate our approach on two state-of-the-art FPGA graph processing
accelerators and show reproducibility, comparablity, as well as the shortened

in s-process elements (CEMP-s), in r-process elements (CEMP-r) or in both s-

between CEMP-s and CEMP-rs stars is presently unknown. It has been claimed that
the i-process, whose site still remains to be identified, could better
reproduce CEMP-rs abundances than the s-process. We analyze high-resolution
spectra of 25 metal-poor stars, observed with the high-resolution HERMES
spectrograph mounted on the Mercator telescope, La Palma, or with the UVES/VLT

for CEMP-s and CEMP-rs stars using eight heavy element abundances. The
abundance profiles of CEMP-s and CEMP-rs stars are derived and there appears to
be an abundance continuum between the two stellar classes. CEMP-rs stars
present most of the characteristics of extrinsic stars such as CEMP-s, CH,
Barium and extrinsic S stars, with an even larger binarity rate among CEMP-rs
stars than among CEMP-s stars. Stellar evolutionary tracks of an enhanced
carbon composition (consistent with our abundance determinations) are necessary
to explain the position of CEMP-s and CEMP-rs stars in the HR diagram using
Gaia DR2 parallaxes; they are found to lie mostly on the RGB. CEMP-rs stars can
be explained as being polluted by a low-mass, low-metallicity TP-AGB companion
experiencing i-process nucleosynthesis after proton ingestion during its first
convective thermal pulses. The global fitting of our i-process models to
CEMP-rs stars is as good as the one of our s-process models to CEMP-s stars. As
such, CEMP-rs stars could be renamed as CEMP-sr stars, since they represent a
particular manifestation of the s-process at low-metallicities. For these
objects a call for an exotic i-process site may not necessarily be required

presented based on the work achieved by a working group of the International
Astronomical Union (IAU) mandated for this purpose. This new realization,
referred to as ICRF3, is based on nearly 40 years of data acquired by very long
baseline interferometry. The ICRF3 includes positions at 8.4 GHz for 4536
sources, supplemented with positions at 24 GHz for 824 sources and at 32 GHz
for 678 sources, for a total of 4588 sources. A subset of 303 sources among
these, uniformly distributed on the sky, are identified as ""defining sources""
and as such serve to define the axes of the frame. Source positions are
reported for epoch 2015.0 and must be propagated for observations at other
epochs for the most accurate needs, accounting for the acceleration toward the
Galactic center, which results in a dipolar proper motion field of amplitude
0.0058 milliarcsecond/yr (mas/yr). The frame shows a median positional
uncertainty of about 0.1 mas in right ascension and 0.2 mas in declination,
with a noise floor of 0.03 mas in the individual source coordinates. A subset
of 500 sources is found to have extremely accurate positions at 8.4 GHz, in the
range of 0.03 to 0.06 mas. Comparing ICRF3 with the Gaia Celestial Reference
Frame 2 in the optical domain, there is no evidence for deformations larger
than 0.03 mas between the two frames. Significant positional offsets between
the three ICRF3 frequencies are detected for about 5% of the sources. Moreover,
a notable fraction (22%) of the sources shows optical and radio positions that
are significantly offset. There are indications that these positional offsets
may be the manifestation of extended source structures. This third realization
of the ICRF was adopted by the IAU at its 30th General Assembly in August 2018
and replaced the previous realization, ICRF2, on January 1, 2019.

collectively approximate the original data points for each class. To
efficiently capture local neighbor relationships, a small number of such

spatio-temporal variations. In two distinct configurations, the surface layers

random field, the mean is always set to zero and the standard deviation is
varied until spin-field energy is comparable to the dominant cooperative energy

complexity of galaxies, the lensing galaxy is often drawn from high resolution,
dark matter only or hydro-dynamical simulations. These have their own
limitations, but the way we use them to emulate mock lensed systems may also
introduce significant artefacts. In this work we identify and explore the
specific impact of mass truncation on simulations of strong lenses by applying
different truncation schemes to a fiducial density profile with conformal
isodensity contours. Our main finding is that improper mass truncation can
introduce undesired artificial shear. The amplitude of the spurious shear
depends on the shape and size of the truncation area as well as on the slope
and ellipticity of the lens density profile. Due to this effect, the value of
H0 or the shear amplitude inferred by modelling those systems may be biased by
several percents. However, we show that the effect becomes negligible provided
that the lens projected map extends over at least 50 times the Einstein radius.

from linear pulsation models. In contrast, nonlinear models predict an earlier
onset of dominant fundamental mode pulsation, and shorter periods at large

observations, that we verify against OGLE and Gaia data for the Magellanic

linear predictions originate from the readjustment of the envelope structure

not permit us to trust the produced software models, which lead to costly test
activities for validating the models and to the waste of learning time in case
the models are likely to be faulty due to the learning inability. Methods for
evaluating the decision trees learning ability, as well as that for the other

a hot topic. We propose a novel oracle-centered approach to evaluate (the
learning ability of) learning algorithms for decision trees. It consists of
generating data from reference trees playing the role of oracles, producing
learned trees with existing learning algorithms, and determining the degree of
correctness (DOE) of the learned trees by comparing them with the oracles. The
average DOE is used to estimate the quality of the learning algorithm. the We
assess five decision tree learning algorithms based on the proposed approach.

demonstrating that energy dissipation occurs $\sim 1$ parsec from the black

stunning performance. However, the selection of the parameters of L+S is
empirical, and the acceleration rate is limited, which are common failings of
iterative compressed sensing MR imaging (CS-MRI) reconstruction methods. Many
deep learning approaches have been proposed to address these issues, but few of
them use a low-rank prior. In this paper, a model-based low-rank plus sparse
network, dubbed L+S-Net, is proposed for dynamic MR reconstruction. In
particular, we use an alternating linearized minimization method to solve the
optimization problem with low-rank and sparse regularization. Learned soft
singular value thresholding is introduced to ensure the clear separation of the
L component and S component. Then, the iterative steps are unrolled into a
network in which the regularization parameters are learnable. We prove that the
proposed L+S-Net achieves global convergence under two standard assumptions.
Experiments on retrospective and prospective cardiac cine datasets show that
the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art CS and existing deep learning
methods and has great potential for extremely high acceleration factors (up to

a widely adopted approach that gives engineers visibility into cloud systems.
Existing trace analysis approaches focus on debugging single request
correctness issues but not debugging single request performance issues.
Diagnosing a performance issue in a given request requires comparing the
performance of the offending request with the aggregate performance of typical
requests. Effective and efficient debugging of such issues faces three
challenges: (i) identifying the correct aggregate data for diagnosis; (ii)
visualizing the aggregated data; and (iii) efficiently collecting, storing, and
processing trace data.
  We present TraVista, a tool designed for debugging performance issues in a
single trace that addresses these challenges. TraVista extends the popular
single trace Gantt chart visualization with three types of aggregate data -
metric, temporal, and structure data, to contextualize the performance of the
offending trace across all traces.

the exponential function ($2^x$), the step function ($1_{x\geq 0}$), or their
compositions as the activation function in each neuron and hence we call such
networks as Floor-Exponential-Step (FLES) networks. For any width
hyper-parameter $N\in\mathbb{N}^+$, it is shown that FLES networks with width
$\max\{d,N\}$ and three hidden layers can uniformly approximate a H\""older
continuous function $f$ on $[0,1]^d$ with an exponential approximation rate
$3\lambda (2\sqrt{d})^{\alpha} 2^{-\alpha N}$, where $\alpha \in(0,1]$ and
$\lambda>0$ are the H\""older order and constant, respectively. More generally
for an arbitrary continuous function $f$ on $[0,1]^d$ with a modulus of
continuity $\omega_f(\cdot)$, the constructive approximation rate is
$2\omega_f(2\sqrt{d}){2^{-N}}+\omega_f(2\sqrt{d}\,2^{-N})$. Moreover, we extend
such a result to general bounded continuous functions on a bounded set
$E\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$. As a consequence, this new class of networks
overcomes the curse of dimensionality in approximation power when the variation
of $\omega_f(r)$ as $r\rightarrow 0$ is moderate (e.g., $\omega_f(r)\lesssim
r^\alpha$ for H\""older continuous functions), since the major term to be
concerned in our approximation rate is essentially $\sqrt{d}$ times a function
of $N$ independent of $d$ within the modulus of continuity. Finally, we extend
our analysis to derive similar approximation results in the $L^p$-norm for
$p\in[1,\infty)$ via replacing Floor-Exponential-Step activation functions by
continuous activation functions.

traditional blackboard lectures, including the gestures and the facial

means of teaching mathematics, this paper deliberately does not want to propose
a novel pedagogical concept of how to teach mathematics, but rather presents a
technical concept how to preserve the quality of traditional blackboard
lectures even during the pandemic and how to make them available to the
students at home via online streaming with adequate audio and video quality at
low internet bandwidth. The second assumption is that the teaching of
mathematics is a dynamic creative process that requires the physical presence
of students in the lecture hall as audience so that the professor can
instantaneously fine-tune the evolution of the lecture according to his/her
perception of the level of attention and the facial expressions of the
students. The third assumption of this paper is that students need to have the
possibility to interact with each other personally. We report on the necessary

the mechanical aspects that make a pilar (the simplest structure in the
castells) to stand. We suggest three different but complementary approaches for
the running stage of a pilar (stage where it has been built and has not yet
collapsed): the $N$-link pendulum as a first dynamical model, the response of
the castellers as a control problem, and a static analysis to capture the
feasibility of a given configuration. We include some preliminary simulations
to better understand the previous approaches, which seem to match with
qualitative perceptions that castellers have of a castell. Possible future
developments are also discussed. To our knowledge, this work represents the

invertibility, and construction of the compositional inverse for non-linear
maps over finite fields. Though there is vast literature available for the
invertibility of polynomials and construction of inverses of permutation
polynomials over $\mathbb{F}$, this paper explores a completely new approach
using the dual map defined through the Koopman operator. This helps define the
linear representation of the non-linear map,, which helps translate the map's
non-linear compositions to a linear algebraic framework. The linear
representation, defined over the space of functions, naturally defines a notion
of linear complexity for non-linear maps, which can be viewed as a measure of
computational complexity associated with such maps. The framework of linear
representation is then extended to parameter dependent maps over $\mathbb{F}$,
and the conditions on parametric invertibility of such maps are established,
leading to a construction of a parametric inverse map (under composition). It
is shown that the framework can be extended to multivariate maps over
$\mathbb{F}^n$, and the conditions are established for invertibility of such
maps, and the inverse is constructed using the linear representation. Further,
the problem of linear representation of a group generated by a finite set of
permutation maps over $\mathbb{F}^n$ under composition is also solved by
extending the theory of linear representation of a single map.

geography, population distribution, and effectiveness in implementation.
Consequently, some nations (e.g., Taiwan, Haiti) have been more successful than
others (e.g., United States) in curbing the outbreak. A data-driven
investigation into effective public health policies of a country would allow
public health experts in other nations to decide future courses of action to
control the outbreaks of disease and epidemics. We chose Spain and India to
present our analysis on regions that were similar in terms of certain factors:
(1) population density, (2) unemployment rate, (3) tourism, and (4) quality of

can provide insights into conformity to policy and suitably reflect on future
case predictions. A milestone when the curves show the number of new cases
diverging from each other is used to define a time period to extract
policy-related tweets while the concepts from a causality network of
policy-dependent sub-events are used to generate concept clouds. The number of
new cases is predicted using sentiment scores in a regression model. We see
that the new case predictions reflects twitter sentiment, meaningfully tied to

  learning","arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2010.12731",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  In this paper, we propose an iterative framework for self-supervised speaker
representation learning based on a deep neural network (DNN). The framework
starts with training a self-supervision speaker embedding network by maximizing
agreement between different segments within an utterance via a contrastive
loss. Taking advantage of DNN's ability to learn from data with label noise, we
propose to cluster the speaker embedding obtained from the previous speaker
network and use the subsequent class assignments as pseudo labels to train a
new DNN. Moreover, we iteratively train the speaker network with pseudo labels
generated from the previous step to bootstrap the discriminative power of a
DNN. Speaker verification experiments are conducted on the VoxCeleb dataset.
The results show that our proposed iterative self-supervised learning framework
outperformed previous works using self-supervision. The speaker network after 5
iterations obtains a 61% performance gain over the speaker embedding model
trained with contrastive loss.

and past inputs is a non-trivial and challenging research area in computer
science. In many practical applications the future inputs are not available to
the algorithm at any instance of time. So the algorithm has to make decisions
based on a sequence of inputs that are in order and on the fly. Such algorithms
are known as online algorithms. For measuring the performance of online
algorithms, a standard measure, known as competitive analysis, has been
extensively used in the literature. List update problem is a well studied
research problem in the area of online algorithms since last few decades. One
of the widely used deterministic online list update algorithm is the
Move-To-Front (MTF) algorithm, which has been shown to be 2-competitive with
best performance in practical real life inputs. In this paper we analyse the
Move-to-Front-or-Middle (MFM) algorithm using competitive analysis by
addressing one of an open question raised by Albers that whether dynamic
offline algorithm can be used in finding the competitiveness of an online
algorithm? Move-To-Front-or-Middle (MFM) was experimentally studied and
observed to be performing better than MTF algorithm by using the Calgary Corpus
and Canterbury Corpus data set. However, it is interesting and challenging to
find the lower bound and upper bound on the competitive ratio of MFM algorithm.
We make a first attempt to find the competitiveness of MFM algorithm. Our new
results show that MFM is not 2-competitive with respect to static optimum
offline algorithm, whereas it is 2-competitive with respect to dynamic optimum
offline algorithm. Our new theoretical results may open up a new direction of
research in the online list update problem by characterising the structure of
competitive and non competitive deterministic online algorithms.

curvature becomes infinite at the center of the black hole, while for non-zero
values of $\gamma$ parameter the black hole curvature reflects the properties
of regular black hole. Analyzing the innermost stable circular orbits of test
neutral particles around RGI black hole and comparing with the results for
rotating Kerr black hole we have shown that RGI black hole parameters can mimic
the rotation parameter of Kerr black hole upto $a/M \lesssim 0.31$ providing
the same ISCO radius. Since according to the astronomical observations of the
accretion disks confirm that the astrophysical black holes are rapidly rotating
with the spin parameter upto $a/M \sim 0.99$ one may conclude that the effects
of parameters of RGI Schwarzschild black hole on the circular orbits of the

equation has been used to analyze the charged and magnetized particles motion
near the RGI black hole in the presence of the strong interaction between

  a case study in intelligent structural control","16 pages, 16 figures",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In many reinforcement learning (RL) problems, it takes some time until a
taken action by the agent reaches its maximum effect on the environment and
consequently the agent receives the reward corresponding to that action by a
delay called action-effect delay. Such delays reduce the performance of the
learning algorithm and increase the computational costs, as the reinforcement
learning agent values the immediate rewards more than the future reward that is
more related to the taken action. This paper addresses this issue by
introducing an applicable enhanced Q-learning method in which at the beginning
of the learning phase, the agent takes a single action and builds a function
that reflects the environments response to that action, called the reflexive
$\gamma$ - function. During the training phase, the agent utilizes the created
reflexive $\gamma$- function to update the Q-values. We have applied the
developed method to a structural control problem in which the goal of the agent
is to reduce the vibrations of a building subjected to earthquake excitations
with a specified delay. Seismic control problems are considered as a complex
task in structural engineering because of the stochastic and unpredictable
nature of earthquakes and the complex behavior of the structure. Three
scenarios are presented to study the effects of zero, medium, and long
action-effect delays and the performance of the Enhanced method is compared to
the standard Q-learning method. Both RL methods use neural network to learn to
estimate the state-action value function that is used to control the structure.
The results show that the enhanced method significantly outperforms the
performance of the original method in all cases, and also improves the
stability of the algorithm in dealing with action-effect delays.

digital forensic investigation are wide and varied, however, there is no way to
express the results into a standardized format. The standardization are
different by types of device, file system, or application. Different outputs
make it time-consuming and difficult to share information and to implement
integration. In addition, it could weaken cyber security. Thus, it is important
to define normalization and to present data in the same format. In this paper,
a 5W1H-based expression for information sharing for effective digital forensic
investigation is proposed to analyze digital forensic information using six
questions--what, who, where, when, why and how. Based on the 5W1H-based
expression, digital information from different types of files is converted and
represented in the same format of outputs. As the 5W1H is the basic writing
principle, application of the 5W1H-based expression on the case studies shows
that this expression enhances clarity and correctness for information sharing.

in costly punishment of defectors in public goods games. Based on such pieces
of evidence, it is suggested that punishment serves an important role in
promoting cooperation in humans, and possibly other species. Nevertheless,
theoretical work has been unable to show how this is possible. The problem
originates from the fact that punishment, being costly, is an altruistic act
and its evolution is subject to the same problem that it tries to address. To
suppress this so-called second-order free-rider problem, known theoretical
models on the evolution of punishment resort to one of the few established
mechanisms for the evolution of cooperation. This leaves the question that
whether altruistic punishment can evolve and give rise to the evolution of
cooperation, unaddressed. Here, by considering a population of individuals who
play a public goods game, followed by a public punishing game, introduced here,
we show that altruistic punishment indeed evolves and promotes cooperation, in

Besides, our analysis shows, being close to a physical phase transition

in terms of RMSE, MAE and R2_score have been analyzed and compared with the
existing techniques. It has been observed that improved accuracy is achieved
through random forest and ridge regressor for both grid sizes in contrast to
all other proposed methods. Stability and reliability of the proposed schemes
are evaluated on a single solar station as well as on multiple independent
runs.
