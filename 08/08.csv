ground states with spontaneously broken symmetry because the electron-electron
interactions dominate over the kinetic energy. A collective ground state of
particular interest is the chased after exciton condensate (EC). However, in
flat band systems other collective ground states can compete with an EC phase,
and the conventional treatment of the effect of thermal and quantum
fluctuations predicts the EC phase should be unstable. Here, using double
twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) heterostructures as an example, we show that
for realistic interaction strengths the EC phase is favored with respect to
other TBLG's phases -- orbital magnetism and superconductivity -- when the
TBLGs have opposite doping, and that the quantum metric of the Bloch wave
functions stabilizes the EC, reversing the conclusion that would be drawn from
the conventional approach in which quantum metric contributions are neglected.
Our results suggest that the quantum metric plays a critical role in
determining the stability of exciton condensates in double layers formed by
systems with flat-bands.

dynamical systems, called \emph{ensemble control}, arise in numerous scientific
areas from quantum control and robotics to brain medicine. In many of such
applications, control can only be implemented at the population level, i.e.,
through broadcasting an input signal to all the systems in the population, and
this new control paradigm challenges the classical systems theory. In recent
years, considerable efforts have been made to investigate controllability
properties of ensemble systems, and most works emphasized on linear and some
forms of bilinear and nonlinear ensemble systems. In this paper, we study
controllability of a broad class of bilinear ensemble systems defined on
semisimple Lie groups, for which we define the notion of ensemble
controllability through a Riemannian structure of the state space Lie group.
Leveraging the Cartan decomposition of semisimple Lie algebras in
representation theory, we develop a \emph{covering method} that decomposes the
state space Lie group into a collection of Lie subgroups generating the Lie
group, which enables the determination of ensemble controllability by
controllability of the subsystems evolving on these Lie subgroups. Using the
covering method, we show the equivalence between ensemble and classical
controllability, i.e., controllability of each individual system in the
ensemble implies ensemble controllability, for bilinear ensemble systems
evolving on semisimple Lie groups. This equivalence makes the examination of
controllability for infinite-dimensional ensemble systems as tractable as for a
finite-dimensional single system.

When these ions
are concentrated and thermalized around a discontinuity, a diamagnetic cavity
bounded by compressional boundaries, referred to as a foreshock transient,
forms. Sometimes, the upstream compressional boundary can further steepen into
a secondary shock, which has been observed to accelerate particles and
contribute to the primary shock acceleration. However, secondary shock
formation conditions and processes are not fully understood. Using
particle-in-cell simulations, we reveal how secondary shocks are formed. From
1D simulations, we show that electric fields play a critical role in shaping
the shock's magnetic field structure, as well as in coupling the energy of hot
ions to that of the shock. We demonstrate that larger thermal speed and
concentration ratio of hot ions favors the formation of a secondary shock. From
a more realistic 2D simulation, we examine how a discontinuity interacts with
foreshock ions leading to the formation of a foreshock transient and a
secondary shock. Our results imply that secondary shocks are more likely to
occur at primary shocks with higher Mach number. With the secondary shock's
previously proven ability to accelerate particles in cooperation with a
planetary bow shock, it is even more appealing to consider them in particle
acceleration of high Mach number astrophysical shocks.

of a global belief model in the form of an upper expectation that is the most

which describe how local and global belief models should be related, is based
on two possible interpretations for an upper expectation: a behavioural one
similar to Walley's, and an interpretation in terms of upper envelopes of
linear expectations. We show that the most conservative upper expectation
satisfying our axioms, that is, our model of choice, coincides with a
particular version of the game-theoretic upper expectation introduced by Shafer
and Vovk. This has two important implications: it guarantees that there is a
unique most conservative global belief model satisfying our axioms; and it
shows that Shafer and Vovk's model can be given an axiomatic characterisation
and thereby provides an alternative motivation for adopting this model, even
outside their game-theoretic framework. Finally, we relate our model to the
upper expectation resulting from a traditional measure-theoretic approach. We
show that this measure-theoretic upper expectation also satisfies the proposed
axioms, which implies that it is dominated by our model or, equivalently, the
game-theoretic model. Moreover, if all local models are precise, all three
models coincide.

inertial waves is computed using a frequency-averaged formalism accounting for
realistic stellar structure for the first time, and is the dominant mechanism
for binary circularization and synchronization on the main sequence.
Dissipation of gravity waves in the radiation zone assumes these waves to be
fully damped (e.g.~by wave breaking), and is the dominant mechanism for
planetary orbital decay. We calculate the critical planetary mass required for
wave breaking as a function of stellar mass and age, and show that this
mechanism predicts destruction of many hot Jupiters but probably not Earth-mass
planets on the main sequence. We apply our results to compute tidal quality
factors following stellar evolution, and tidal evolutionary timescales, for the
orbital decay of hot Jupiters, and the spin synchronization and circularization
of binary stars. We also provide predictions for shifts in transit arrival
times due to tidally-driven orbital decay of hot Jupiters that may be detected

zeros appear in the diagonal of the coefficient matrix. Considering the
large-scale attribute of matrix acidization simulation, the solving time of
direct solvers is not intolerant. Thus, a decoupled scheme is proposed in this
work to decouple the coupled pressure-velocity linear system into two
independent linear systems: one is to solve for pressure, and the other one is
to solve for velocity. Both of the new linear systems can be solved by parallel
and iterative solvers, which guarantees the large-scale simulation can be

detection, but they still suffer from the challenge that the action instances
span a wide range of time. The reason is that these one-stage detectors, e.g.,
Single Shot Multi-Box Detector (SSD), extract temporal features only applying a
single-level layer for each head, which is not discriminative enough to perform
classification and regression. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Level Temporal
Pyramid Network (MLTPN) to improve the discrimination of the features.
Specially, we first fuse the features from multiple layers with different
temporal resolutions, to encode multi-layer temporal information. We then apply
a multi-level feature pyramid architecture on the features to enhance their
discriminative abilities. Finally, we design a simple yet effective feature
fusion module to fuse the multi-level multi-scale features. By this means, the
proposed MLTPN can learn rich and discriminative features for different action
instances with different durations. We evaluate MLTPN on two challenging
datasets: THUMOS'14 and Activitynet v1.3, and the experimental results show
that MLTPN obtains competitive performance on Activitynet v1.3 and outperforms
the state-of-the-art approaches on THUMOS'14 significantly.

collective electronic behavior and their fluctuations are taken into account.
In the past decade, improvements in source brightness and detector technology
at modern x-ray facilities have allowed a dramatically increased fraction of
this information to be captured. Now, the primary challenge is to understand
and discover scientific principles from big data sets when a comprehensive
analysis is beyond human reach. We report the development of a novel
unsupervised machine learning approach, XRD Temperature Clustering (X-TEC),
that can automatically extract charge density wave (CDW) order parameters and
detect intra-unit cell (IUC) ordering and its fluctuations from a series of
high-volume X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements taken at multiple
temperatures. We apply X-TEC to XRD data on a quasi-skutterudite family of
materials, (Ca$_x$Sr$_{1-x}$)$_3$Rh$_4$Sn$_{13}$, where a quantum critical
point arising from charge order is observed as a function of Ca concentration.
We further apply X-TEC to XRD data on the pyrochlore metal, Cd$_2$Re$_2$O$_7$,
to investigate its two much debated structural phase transitions and uncover
the Goldstone mode accompanying them. We demonstrate how unprecedented atomic
scale knowledge can be gained when human researchers connect the X-TEC results
to physical principles. Specifically, we extract from the X-TEC-revealed
selection rule that the Cd and Re displacements are approximately equal in
amplitude, but out of phase. This discovery reveals a previously unknown
involvement of $5d^2$ Re, supporting the idea of an electronic origin to the
structural order. Our approach can radically transform XRD experiments by
allowing in-operando data analysis and enabling researchers to refine
experiments by discovering interesting regions of phase space on-the-fly.

language is used in context and attempting to use it themselves. They do so
without laborious annotations, negative examples, or even direct corrections.
We take a step toward robots that can do the same by training a grounded
semantic parser, which discovers latent linguistic representations that can be
used for the execution of natural-language commands. In particular, we focus on
the difficult domain of commands with a temporal aspect, whose semantics we
capture with Linear Temporal Logic, LTL. Our parser is trained with pairs of
sentences and executions as well as an executor. At training time, the parser
hypothesizes a meaning representation for the input as a formula in LTL. Three
competing pressures allow the parser to discover meaning from language. First,
any hypothesized meaning for a sentence must be permissive enough to reflect
all the annotated execution trajectories. Second, the executor -- a pretrained
end-to-end LTL planner -- must find that the observe trajectories are likely
executions of the meaning. Finally, a generator, which reconstructs the
original input, encourages the model to find representations that conserve
knowledge about the command. Together these ensure that the meaning is neither
too general nor too specific. Our model generalizes well, being able to parse
and execute both machine-generated and human-generated commands, with
near-equal accuracy, despite the fact that the human-generated sentences are
much more varied and complex with an open lexicon. The approach presented here
is not specific to LTL: it can be applied to any domain where sentence meanings
can be hypothesized and an executor can verify these meanings, thus opening the
door to many applications for robotic agents.

further analysed. There appears to be a structure in the plot of equivalent
widths of 5780$\r{A}$ DIB (and 6284$\r{A}$ DIB) against the Galactic
$x$-coordinate. The structure is well defined below $\sim150$ m$\r{A}$ and
within $|x|<250$ pc, peaking around $x=170$ pc. We argue that the origin of
this structure is not a statistical fluctuation. Splitting the data in the
Galactic longitude into several subregions improves or lowers the well known
linear relation between the equivalent widths and the colour excess, which was
expected. However, some of the lines of sight display drastically different
behaviour. The region within $150^\circ<l<200^\circ$ shows scatter in the

Finally, the area $250^\circ<l<300^\circ$ displays (from the statistical point
of view) significantly lower values of equivalent widths than the other regions

actions on the onset of the pandemic. Decentralized equilibria are virtually
independent of waning immunity until close to peak infections. For centralized
equilibria, the relevance of waning immunity decreases in the probability of
finding a vaccine or cure, the costs of infection (e.g., infection-fatality
rate), and the presence of other NPIs that lower contagion (e.g., quarantining
and mask use). In simulations calibrated to July 2020, our model suggests that
waning immunity is virtually unimportant for centralized equilibria until at

new aspects. We first find that a best-fit ""softer-when-brighter"" relation is
statistically insufficient to explain the observed spectral variabilities, and
intervals deviated from the empirical relation are clearly visible in the light
curve of 2 -- 4 keV/4 -- 10 keV count rate ratio. The deviations are seen not
only between but also within individual XMM-Newton exposures, consistent with
random variations of the corona geometry or inner structure (with timescales as
short as $\sim$ 1 ks), in addition to those behind the smooth
""softer-when-brighter"" trend. We further find the ""softer-when-brighter"" trend
gradually weakens with the decreasing timescale (from $\sim$ 100 ks down to 0.5
ks). These findings indicate that the powerlaw spectral slope is not solely
determined by its brightness. We propose a two-tier geometry, including
flares/nano-flares on top of the inner disc and an embedding extended corona
(heated by the flares, in analogy to solar corona) to explain the observations
together with other observational clues in literature. Rapid spectral
variabilities could be due to individual flares/nano-flares, while slow ones
are driven by the variations in the global activity of inner disc region (akin
to the variation of solar activity, but not the accretion rate) accompanied
with heating/cooling and inflation/contraction of the extended corona.

hands, by using only a depth sensor and a state-of-the-art 3D hand pose
estimator (HPE), is challenging. While virtual environments are ruled by
physics, e.g. object weights and surface frictions, the absence of force
feedback makes the task challenging, as even slight inaccuracies on finger tips
or contact points from HPE may make the interactions fail. Prior arts simply
generate contact forces in the direction of the fingers' closures, when finger
joints penetrate virtual objects. Although useful for simple grasping
scenarios, they cannot be applied to dexterous manipulations such as in-hand
manipulation. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) and imitation learning (IL)
approaches train agents that learn skills by using task-specific rewards,
without considering any online user input. In this work, we propose to learn a
model that maps noisy input hand poses to target virtual poses, which
introduces the needed contacts to accomplish the tasks on a physics simulator.
The agent is trained in a residual setting by using a model-free hybrid RL+IL
approach. A 3D hand pose estimation reward is introduced leading to an
improvement on HPE accuracy when the physics-guided corrected target poses are
remapped to the input space. As the model corrects HPE errors by applying minor
but crucial joint displacements for contacts, this helps to keep the generated
motion visually close to the user input. Since HPE sequences performing
successful virtual interactions do not exist, a data generation scheme to train
and evaluate the system is proposed. We test our framework in two applications
that use hand pose estimates for dexterous manipulations: hand-object
interactions in VR and hand-object motion reconstruction in-the-wild.

show that, provided the PBH formation criteria and the power spectrum smoothing

critical collapse, the non-linear relation between $\zeta$ and $\delta$, and
the shift from the PBH mass to the power spectrum peak scale. We show that
these constraints are remarkably similar to the pulsar timing array (PTA)

continues to increase over the years due to the recent advancement of
semiconductor manufacturing and reduction of cost per transistors. The hardware
implementation makes cryptographic operations faster and more energy-efficient.
However, various hardware attacks have been proposed aiming to extract the
secret key in order to undermine the security of these primitives. In this
paper, we focus on the widely used advanced encryption standard (AES) block
cipher and demonstrate its vulnerability against tampering attack. Our proposed
attack relies on implanting a hardware Trojan in the netlist by an untrusted
foundry, which can design and implement such a Trojan as it has access to the
design layout and mask information. The hardware Trojan's activation modifies a
particular round's input data by preventing the effect of all previous rounds'
key-dependent computation. We propose to use a sequential hardware Trojan to
deliver the payload at the input of an internal round for achieving this
modification of data. All the internal subkeys, and finally, the secret key can
be computed from the observed ciphertext once the Trojan is activated. We
implement our proposed tampering attack with a sequential hardware Trojan
inserted into a 128-bit AES design from OpenCores benchmark suite and report
the area overhead to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed tampering
attack.

enhanced central density of a WD in the gravitational potential of a very dense

systematic and uniform analyses of 55 NuSTAR spectra for a large sample of 28
radio galaxies, 20 of which are FR II galaxies. We perform spectral fitting to
measure the high energy cut-off $E_{cut}$, photon index $\Gamma$, reflection
factor R and Fe K$\alpha$ line equivalent width. Measurements of $E_{cut}$ are
given for 13 sources, and lower limits for the rest. We find those $E_{cut}$
non-detections could primarily be attributed to the obviously smaller net
photon counts in their spectra. This indicates that the NuSTAR spectra of the
majority of our sample are dominated by the thermal corona emission, and the
$E_{cut}$ distribution of the sample is indistinguishable from that of a radio
quiet one in literature. The flatter NuSTAR spectra we observed, comparing with
radio quiet sources, are thus unlikely due to jet contamination. The radio
galaxies also show weaker X-ray reflection (both in R and Fe K$\alpha$ line EW)
comparing with radio quiet ones. Combining with the radio quiet sample we see a
correlation between R and EW, but with considerably large scatter. Notably, the
radio loud and quiet sources appear to follow a common $\Gamma$ - R correlation
trend, supporting the outflowing corona model for both populations in which
higher bulk outflowing velocity yields weaker reflection and flatter X-ray

classification. We describe in detail our pipeline, data products, tools and
services, which are made public for the community (see

that in the dilute electron density limit, Peierls bipolaron liquids are
generically stable, unlike in other models of electron-phonon coupling. We show
that this behavior extends to finite carrier concentrations of up to quarter

analysis. With this in mind, in this work we apply deep learning techniques to
perform fast likelihood-free Bayesian inference for gravitational waves. We
train a neural-network conditional density estimator to model posterior
probability distributions over the full 15-dimensional space of binary black
hole system parameters, given detector strain data from multiple detectors. We
use the method of normalizing flows---specifically, a neural spline normalizing
flow---which allows for rapid sampling and density estimation. Training the
network is likelihood-free, requiring samples from the data generative process,
but no likelihood evaluations. Through training, the network learns a global
set of posteriors: it can generate thousands of independent posterior samples
per second for any strain data consistent with the prior and detector noise
characteristics used for training. By training with the detector noise power
spectral density estimated at the time of GW150914, and conditioning on the
event strain data, we use the neural network to generate accurate posterior

Bell's inequalities for a pair of particles can be maximally violated in a

which allows us to transform the problem to the rest frame of a particle, whose
state can be in a superposition of relativistic momenta from the viewpoint of
the laboratory frame. We show that, when the relative motion of two particles
is non-collinear, the optimal measurements for violation of Bell's inequalities
in the laboratory frame involve ""coherent Wigner rotations"". Moreover, the
degree of violation of Bell's inequalities is independent of the choice of the
quantum reference frame. Our results open up the possibility of extending
entanglement-based quantum communication protocols to relativistic regimes.

formation history (SFH) in the inner Galaxy. We find that the on-bar and

consistent [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] distribution functions and [Mg/Fe]--[Fe/H]
relation, suggesting a common SFH shared by the long bar and the disc. In
contrast, the bar and disc at smaller radii (2 $< r_{\rm GC} <$ 3 kpc) show
noticeable differences, with relatively more very metal-rich ([Fe/H]~0.4) stars
but fewer solar abundance stars in the bar. Given the three-phase star
formation history proposed for the inner Galaxy in Lian et al. (2020b), these
differences could be explained by the off-bar disc having experienced either a
faster early quenching process or recent metal-poor gas accretion. Vertical
variations of the abundance distributions at small $r_{\rm GC}$ suggest a wider
vertical distribution of low-$\alpha$ stars in the bar, which may serve as
chemical evidence for vertical heating through the bar buckling process. The
lack of such vertical variations outside the bulge may then suggest a lack of

preference to robot motion that can be better localized and thus has the
potential of improving vision-based navigation, especially in visually degraded
environments. To integrate the knowledge about localization accuracy in motion
planning algorithms, a central task is to quantify the amount of information
that an image taken at a 6 degree-of-freedom pose brings for localization,
which is often represented by the Fisher information. However, computing the
Fisher information from a set of sparse landmarks (i.e., a point cloud), which
is the most common map for visual localization, is inefficient. This approach
scales linearly with the number of landmarks in the environment and does not
allow the reuse of the computed Fisher information. To overcome these
drawbacks, we propose the first dedicated map representation for evaluating the
Fisher information of 6 degree-of-freedom visual localization for
perception-aware motion planning. By formulating the Fisher information and
sensor visibility carefully, we are able to separate the rotational invariant
component from the Fisher information and store it in a voxel grid, namely the
Fisher information field. This step only needs to be performed once for a known
environment. The Fisher information for arbitrary poses can then be computed
from the field in constant time, eliminating the need of costly iterating all
the 3D landmarks at the planning time. Experimental results show that the
proposed Fisher information field can be applied to different motion planning
algorithms and is at least one order-of-magnitude faster than using the point
cloud directly. Moreover,the proposed map representation is differentiable,
resulting in better performance than the point cloud when used in trajectory
optimization algorithms.

with the central component resembling core emission. We have investigated
modulations in single pulse behaviour using the fluctuation spectral analysis
which showed presence of two prominent periodicities, around 2.5$P$ and 40$P$,
respectively. The shorter periodicity was associated with the phenomenon of
subpulse drifting and was seen to be absent in central core component. Drifting
showed large phase variations in conal components. Additionally, the periodic
modulations had significant evolution with time, varying between very sharp and
highly diffuse features. In addition to drifting the pulsar also had presence
of nulling in the single pulse sequence. The longer periodic feature in the
fluctuation spectra was associated with nulling behaviour. The pulsar joins a
select group which shows the presence of phase modulated drifting as well as
periodic nulling in the presence of core emission. This provides further
evidence for the two phenomena to be distinct from each other with different

generates distributed vector representations of ADE report entities that
capture patterns of similarity but cannot utilize lexical knowledge. We address

  Astrophysical Journal",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We analyze the detection capability of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) for all
currently operating coronagraphs in space. We define as CMEs events that
propagate beyond 10 solar radii with morphologies broadly consistent with a
magnetic flux rope presence. We take advantage of multi-viewpoint observations
over five month-long intervals, corresponding to special orbital configurations
of the coronagraphs aboard the STEREO and SOHO missions. This allows us to sort
out CMEs from other outward-propagating features (e.g. waves or outflows), and
thus to identify the total number of unique CMEs ejected during those periods.
We determine the CME visibility functions of the STEREO COR2-A/B and LASCO
C2/C3 coronagraphs directly as the ratio of observed to unique CMEs. The
visibility functions range from 0.71 to 0.92 for a 95% confidence interval. By
comparing detections between coronagraphs on the same spacecraft and from
multiple spacecraft, we assess the influence of field of view, instrument
performance, and projection effects on the CME detection ability without
resorting to proxies, such as flares or radio bursts. We find that no major
CMEs are missed by any of the coronagraphs, that a few slow halo-like events
may be missed in synoptic cadence movies and, that narrow field of view
coronagraphs have difficulties discriminating between CMEs and other ejections
leading to false detection rates. We conclude that CME detection can only be
validated with multi-viewpoint imaging-- two coronagraphs in quadrature offer
adequate detection capability. Finally, we apply the visibility functions to
observed CME rates resulting in upward corrections of 40%.

mitigating the impact of magnetic activity in radial velocity measurements and
can help constrain the high-energy flux environment and space weather of
planetary systems. Millions of stars and thousands of planet hosts are observed
with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). However, most will only
be observed for 27 contiguous days in a year, making it difficult to measure
rotation periods with traditional methods. This is especially problematic for
field M dwarfs, which are ideal candidates for exoplanet searches, but which
tend to have periods in excess of the 27-day observing baseline. We present a
new tool, Astraea, for predicting long rotation periods from short-duration
light curves combined with stellar parameters from Gaia DR2. Using Astraea, we
can predict the rotation periods from Kepler 4-year light curves with 13%
uncertainty overall (and a 9% uncertainty for periods > 30 days). By training
on 27-day Kepler light curve segments, Astraea can predict rotation periods up
to 150 days with 9% uncertainty (5% for periods > 30 days). After training this
tool on these 27-day Kepler light curve segments, we applied \texttt{Astraea}
to real TESS data. For the 195 stars that were observed by both Kepler and

result on one of the most studied, elegant and powerful tools for solving
convex feasibility problems, the method of alternating projections (MAP). Going
back to names such as Kaczmarz and von Neumann, MAP has the ability to track a
pair of points realizing minimum distance between two given closed convex sets.
Unfortunately, MAP may suffer from arbitrarily slow convergence, and sublinear
rates are essentially only surpassed in the presence of some Lipschitzian error
bound, which is our first ingredient. The second one is a seemingly unfavorable
and unexpected condition, namely, infeasibility. For two non-intersecting
closed convex sets satisfying an error bound, we establish finite convergence
of MAP. In particular, MAP converges in finitely many steps when applied to a
polyhedron and a hyperplane in the case in which they have empty intersection.
Moreover, the farther the target sets lie from each other, the fewer are the
iterations needed by MAP for finding a best approximation pair. Insightful
examples and further theoretical and algorithmic discussions accompany our
results, including the investigation of finite termination of other projection
methods.

question of whether there is a procedure, computable by hand, which can
calculate the appropriate premium tax credit for any household with
self-employment income. We motivate current IRS tax guidance, which has had
self-employed taxpayers use a fixed point iteration to calculate their premium
tax credits since 2014. Then, we give an example showing that the IRS iteration
can lead to a divergent sequence of iterates. As a consequence, IRS guidance
does not calculate appropriate premium tax credits for tax returns in certain
income intervals, adversely affecting eligible beneficiaries. A bisection
procedure for calculating premium tax credits is proposed. We prove that this
procedure calculates appropriate premium tax credits for a model of simple tax
returns. This is generalized to the case where premium tax credits are received
in advance, which is the most common one in applications. We outline the
problem of calculating appropriate premium tax credits for models of general
tax returns. While the bisection procedure will work with the tax code in its
current configuration, it could fail, eg, in states which have not expanded
Medicaid, if a new deduction with certain properties were to arise.

the behavior is considerably richer with multi-stability, isolas, and limit

scheme is based on a 4th-order Hermite interpolation in time, and uses an
approach based on operator splitting that converges to the underlying
quadrature if iterated sufficiently. Hermite schemes have been used in
astrophysics for decades, particularly for N-body calculations, but not in a

presented in Sch\""utz and Seal 2020 to higher orders. Such high-order schemes
offer advantages when one aims to find high-precision solutions to systems of

discussing the stability of these formulas. Afterwards, we demonstrate how the
method of Sch\""utz and Seal 2020 generalises in a straightforward manner to any
of these schemes, and prove convergence properties of the resulting IMEX

explore a selection of test problems, including both linear and nonlinear
ordinary differential equations and Burgers' equation. To our knowledge this is

partial differential equations. We then discuss some benefits of these schemes,
such as their potential for parallelism and low memory usage, as well as
limitations and potential drawbacks.

enhanced privacy. Its primary goal is learning a global model that offers good
performance for the participants as many as possible. The technology is rapidly
advancing with many unsolved challenges, among which statistical heterogeneity
(i.e., non-IID) and communication efficiency are two critical ones that hinder
the development of federated learning. In this work, we propose LotteryFL -- a
personalized and communication-efficient federated learning framework via
exploiting the Lottery Ticket hypothesis. In LotteryFL, each client learns a
lottery ticket network (i.e., a subnetwork of the base model) by applying the
Lottery Ticket hypothesis, and only these lottery networks will be communicated
between the server and clients. Rather than learning a shared global model in
classic federated learning, each client learns a personalized model via
LotteryFL; the communication cost can be significantly reduced due to the
compact size of lottery networks. To support the training and evaluation of our
framework, we construct non-IID datasets based on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and EMNIST by
taking feature distribution skew, label distribution skew and quantity skew
into consideration. Experiments on these non-IID datasets demonstrate that
LotteryFL significantly outperforms existing solutions in terms of

and practical interest. However, despite several theoretical research
endeavours in past, the most accurate analysis of the key electronic parameters
for solar cell performance, such as optical properties, effective mass, exciton
binding energy (E$_B$) and the radiative exciton lifetime are still largely
unknown. Here, we employ state-of-the-art first-principles based methodologies
viz. hybrid functional(HSE06) combined with spin-orbit coupling (SOC),
many-body perturbation theory (GW, BSE), model-BSE (mBSE), Wannier-Mott (WM)
and Density Functional Perturbation Theory (DFPT). By taking a prototypical
model system viz. APbI$_3$ (A = Formamidinium (FA), methylammonium (MA), and
Cs), an exhaustive analysis is presented on the theoretical understanding of
the optical, electronic and excitonic properties. We show that tuning of exact
exchange parameter ($\alpha$) in HSE06 calculations incorporating SOC, followed
by single shot GW, and BSE play a pivotal role in obtaining a reliable
predictions for the experimental bandgap. We demonstrate that mBSE approach
improves the feature of optical spectra w.r.t experiments. Furthermore, WM
approach and ionic contribution to dielectric screening (below 16 meV)
ameliorate the E$_B$. Our results reveal that the direct-indirect band gap
transition (Rashba splitting) may be a factor responsible for the reduced
charge carrier recombination rate in MAPbI$_3$ and FAPbI$_3$. The role of
cation ''A'' for procuring the long-lived exciton lifetime is well understood.
This proposed methodology allows to design new materials with tailored

systems. However, the increasing size of real-world networks becomes a major
hurdle in order to understand their structure and topological features.
Therefore, mapping the original network into a smaller one while preserving its
information is an important issue. Extracting the so-called backbone of a
network is a very challenging problem that is generally handled either by
coarse-graining or filter-based methods. Coarse-graining methods reduce the
network size by grouping similar nodes, while filter-based methods prune the
network by discarding nodes or edges based on a statistical property. In this
paper, we propose and investigate two filter-based methods exploiting the
overlapping community structure in order to extract the backbone in weighted
networks. Indeed, highly connected nodes (hubs) and overlapping nodes are at
the heart of the network. In the first method, called ""overlapping nodes ego
backbone"", the backbone is formed simply from the set of overlapping nodes and
their neighbors. In the second method, called ""overlapping nodes and hubs
backbone"", the backbone is formed from the set of overlapping nodes and the
hubs. For both methods, the links with the lowest weights are removed from the
network as long as a backbone with a single connected component is preserved.
Experiments have been performed on real-world weighted networks originating
from various domains (social, co-appearance, collaboration, biological, and
technological) and different sizes. Results show that both backbone extraction
methods are quite similar. Furthermore, comparison with the most influential
alternative filtering method demonstrates the greater ability of the proposed
backbones extraction methods to uncover the most relevant parts of the network.

Dialogue Systems (TDSs) can be grouped into two categories: template-based and
corpus-based. The former prepare a collection of response templates in advance
and fill the slots with system actions to produce system responses at runtime.
The latter generate system responses token by token by taking system actions
into account. While template-based DRG provides high precision and highly
predictable responses, they usually lack in terms of generating diverse and
natural responses when compared to (neural) corpus-based approaches.
Conversely, while corpus-based DRG methods are able to generate natural
responses, we cannot guarantee their precision or predictability. Moreover, the
diversity of responses produced by today's corpus-based DRG methods is still
limited. We propose to combine the merits of template-based and corpus-based
DRGs by introducing a prototype-based, paraphrasing neural network, called
P2-Net, which aims to enhance quality of the responses in terms of both
precision and diversity. Instead of generating a response from scratch, P2-Net
generates system responses by paraphrasing template-based responses. To
guarantee the precision of responses, P2-Net learns to separate a response into
its semantics, context influence, and paraphrasing noise, and to keep the
semantics unchanged during paraphrasing. To introduce diversity, P2-Net
randomly samples previous conversational utterances as prototypes, from which
the model can then extract speaking style information. We conduct extensive
experiments on the MultiWOZ dataset with both automatic and human evaluations.
The results show that P2-Net achieves a significant improvement in diversity
while preserving the semantics of responses.

  Schrodinger equation","16 pages",,,,"math-ph math.MP nlin.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An integrable generalization of the NLS equation is presented, in which the
dynamical complex variable $u(t,x)$ is replaced by a pair of dynamical complex
variables $(u_1(t,x),u_2(t,x))$, and $i$ is replaced by a Pauli matrix $J$.
Integrability is retained by the addition of a nonlocal term in the resulting
2-component system. A further integrable generalization is obtained which
involves a dynamical scalar variable and an additional nonlocal term. For each
system, a Lax pair and a bi-Hamiltonian formulation are derived from a
zero-curvature framework that is based on symmetric Lie algebras and that uses
Hasimoto variables. The systems are each shown to be equivalent to a bi-normal
flow and a Schrodinger map equation, generalizing the well-known equivalence of
the NLS equation to the bi-normal flow in $R^3$ and the Schrodinger map
equation in $S^2$. Furthermore, both of the integrable systems describe
spinor/quaternion NLS-type equations with the pair $(u_1(t,x),u_2(t,x))$ being
viewed as a spinor variable or equivalently a quaternion variable.

the inputs to the web application front ends. Extending the same concept, a
plethora of automated devices, thanks to the advancements in the field of IOT,
have come into existence which can feed on the same set of micro services. This
concept of build once and utilize for many use cases has become a new norm in
the enterprise design patterns. To handle the horizontal scalability needs of
so many calling clients, significant advancements have been made on the
containerization and their orchestration strategies on the public cloud
platforms. However, scalable design techniques have led to the increased
exposure of backend services to unwanted entities. This broadened the attack
surface and also the risk. On top of it the mix of heterogeneous technologies
in MSA, their distinct logging strategies, makes the central logging difficult,
which in turn loosens the security. Additionally, the complexity around
building the resilience for fault tolerance across the decentralized networks,
adds to the security loop holes. The simple security designs which were once
used with traditional web applications cannot be used for Microservice based

They have proven to be an adequate data source in the fields of intelligent
transportation and autonomous driving, especially for extracting vehicles.
However, acquired 3D point clouds of vehicles from MLS systems are inevitably
incomplete due to object occlusion or self-occlusion. To tackle this problem,
we proposed a neural network to synthesize complete, dense, and uniform point
clouds for vehicles from MLS data, named Vehicle Points Completion-Net
(VPC-Net). In this network, we introduce a new encoder module to extract global
features from the input instance, consisting of a spatial transformer network
and point feature enhancement layer. Moreover, a new refiner module is also
presented to preserve the vehicle details from inputs and refine the complete
outputs with fine-grained information. Given sparse and partial point clouds as
inputs, the network can generate complete and realistic vehicle structures and
keep the fine-grained details from the partial inputs. We evaluated the
proposed VPC-Net in different experiments using synthetic and real-scan

and qualitative experiments demonstrate the promising performance of the
proposed VPC-Net and show state-of-the-art results.

(SVDFs) has been used for end-to-end voice trigger detection. The SVDFs
approximate a fully-connected layer with a low rank approximation, which
reduces the number of model parameters. In this work, we propose S1DCNN as an

S1DCNN layer consists of a 1D convolution layer followed by a depth-wise 1D

derive a stable technique, based on the singular value decomposition (SVD) of
lag-covariance and crosscovariance matrices consisting of covariance
coefficients computed for index translated copies of an initial time series.
For these matrices a generalized eigenvalue problem is solved. The initial
signal is mapped into the basis of the generalized eigenvectors and phase
portraits are consequently analyzed. Pattern recognition techniques could be
applied to distinguish phase portraits related to the exponentials and noise.
Each frequency is evaluated by unwrapping phases of the corresponding portrait,
detecting potential wrapping events and estimation of the phase slope.
Efficiency of the proposed and existing methods is compared on the set of
examples, including the white Gaussian and auto-regressive model noise.

learning community. One straightforward way is to reuse some pre-trained
parameters. Some previous work like Deep transfer learning reuse the model
parameters trained for the first task as the starting point for the second
task, and semi-supervised learning is trained upon a combination of labeled and
unlabeled data. However, the fundamental reason of the success of these methods
is unclear. In this paper, the reusability of parameters in each layer of a
deep convolutional neural network is experimentally quantified by using a
network to do segmentation and auto-encoder task. This paper proves that
network parameters can be reused for two reasons: first, the network features
are general; Second, there is little difference between the pre-trained
parameters and the ideal network parameters. Through the use of parameter
replacement and comparison, we demonstrate that reusability is different in
BN(Batch Normalization)[7] layer and Convolution layer and some observations:
(1)Running mean and running variance plays an important role than Weight and
Bias in BN layer.(2)The weight and bias can be reused in BN layers.( 3) The
network is very sensitive to the weight of convolutional layer.(4) The bias in
Convolution layers are not sensitive, and it can be reused directly.

However, accurate system models are not always available in practice. In this
paper, a learning-based safety-stability-driven control (LBSC) algorithm is
presented to guarantee the safety and tracking stability for nonlinear
safety-critical systems subject to control input constraints under model
uncertainties. Gaussian Processes (GPs) are employed to learn the model error
between the nominal model and the actual system dynamics, and the estimated
mean and variance of the model error are used to quantify a high-confidence
uncertainty bound. Using this estimated uncertainty bound, a safety barrier
constraint is devised to ensure safety, and a stability constraint is developed
to achieve rapid and accurate tracking. Then the proposed LBSC method is
formulated as a quadratic program incorporating the safety barrier, the

LBSC method is illustrated on the safety-critical connected cruise control

such as logistic regression and linear support vector machine (SVM)
classification, is the widely used trust region Newton algorithm, TRON. While
TRON has recently been shown to enjoy substantial speedups on shared-memory
multi-core systems, exploiting graphical processing units (GPUs) to speed up
the method is significantly more difficult, owing to the highly complex and
heavily sequential nature of the algorithm. In this work, we show that using
judicious GPU-optimization principles, TRON training time for different losses
and feature representations may be drastically reduced. For sparse feature
sets, we show that using GPUs to train logistic regression classifiers in
LIBLINEAR is up to an order-of-magnitude faster than solely using
multithreading. For dense feature sets--which impose far more stringent memory
constraints--we show that GPUs substantially reduce the lengthy SVM learning
times required for state-of-the-art proteomics analysis, leading to dramatic
improvements over recently proposed speedups. Furthermore, we show how GPU
speedups may be mixed with multithreading to enable such speedups when the
dataset is too large for GPU memory requirements; on a massive dense proteomics
dataset of nearly a quarter-billion data instances, these mixed-architecture
speedups reduce SVM analysis time from over half a week to less than a single
day while using limited GPU memory.

internal dosimetry analysis was performed with emphasis on doses deliverable to

relatively constant in the bone even 10 years after ingestion. The whole-body
dose analysis concluded that it is a factor of 5 higher than what the WHO

However, recognizing useful patterns in all types of images and weighing up the

learnability and simplicity to improve classification accuracy. The key is
using a weight-sharing strategy to encourage interactions between modalities
and adopting an additional cross-modalities objective to integrate global
information. In contrast to hardcoding the weights of each modality in the
model, we embed it in a Reinforcement Learning framework to learn this
weighting in an end-to-end manner. Thus the model is trained to seek the
optimal multimodal combination without handcrafted heuristics. The proposed
framework is evaluated on a dataset contains 1616 set of multimodal images.
Results showed that the model scored a high classification accuracy of 95.4%,

relay channels (MARC). Despite its promising advantage of improving network
throughput, it is not straightforward to apply compute-and-forward to the MARC.
This paper proposes two efficient cooperation strategies for the MARC with
compute-and-forward. Both proposed strategies are opportunistic in the sense
that the cooperation between the relay and the destination are performed only
when it is needed for the sake of high transmission efficiency. In the first
strategy, the relay helps the destination by sending its local optimal integer
coefficient vector without taking into account that the resulting integer
coefficient matrix at the destination is full rank. In contrast, in the second
strategy, the relay forwards its ``best'' coefficient vector that always
ensures a full rank coefficient matrix at the destination. Both of the proposed
strategies achieve twice the network throughput of the existing strategies at
high signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR). They also have lower outage
probability, independent of relay placement. Furthermore, the first strategy
nearly achieves diversity gain of order two, and the second one achieves
exactly the diversity gain of order two, which cannot be achieved by the
existing strategies.

observations with dozens of stars taken through a selected filter. Applying
this method to the reduction of observations captured through different filters

the mean of the residuals between observed and computed positions (O-C) after

N (null) filter, the median of the mean (O-C) for well-exposed stars (about 15
G-mag) decreases from 19 mas to 3 mas, thus achieving better accuracy, i.e.
mean (O-C). Another issue correlated is a systematic error caused by the poor
charge transfer efficiency (CTE) when a CCD frame is read out. This systematic
error is significant for some of the observations captured by the 1-m telescope
at Yunnan Observatory. Using a sigmoidal function to fit and correct the mean
(O-C), a systematic error up to 30 mas can be eliminated.

relatively simple sub-regions: northeast (NE) and southwest (SW). Recurrent
eruptions occurred from the SW sub-region over different evolutionary phases,
which provided a unique opportunity to isolate the physical processes
responsible for solar eruptions. Persistent shearing and convergence of
opposite magnetic polarities led to continuous flux cancellation along the SW
polarity inversion line (PIL). A filament persistently lying along the SW-PIL
was observed to survive each eruption, which suggests the partial eruption of
the magnetic system. Further, following the first and second eruptions, a
sigmoidal magnetic structure of similar morphology was reformed along the
SW-PIL. The photospheric motion of magnetic flux continuously injected and
stored the negative helicity in the partially erupted magnetic system and built
up the magnetic free energy for the successive eruptions. These results suggest
that the shearing motion and magnetic flux cancellation of opposite fluxes
were: (1) the dominant factor, irrespective of the evolutionary phase, that
contributed to the recurrent homologous eruption, and (2) the key processes of
forming the erupting structure, likely a magnetic flux rope, and its
long-lasting continuation results in reformation of identical erupting
structure. The study also finds that similar magnetic topology could result in
the magnetic reconnection at the same location, and such flares during the
precursor phase would help in the eruption by decreasing the constraint of
overlying magnetic field.

As the vehicle density increases, these broadcasts can congest the

related domain (source domain) to a label-scare domain (target domain).
Pseudo-labeling has recently been widely explored and used in DA. However, this
line of research is still confined to the inaccuracy of pseudo-labels. In this
paper, we reveal an interesting observation that the target samples belonging
to the classes with larger domain shift are easier to be misclassified compared
with the other classes. These classes are called hard class, which deteriorates
the performance of DA and restricts the applications of DA. We propose a novel
framework, called Hard Class Rectification Pseudo-labeling (HCRPL), to
alleviate the hard class problem from two aspects. First, as is difficult to
identify the target samples as hard class, we propose a simple yet effective
scheme, named Adaptive Prediction Calibration (APC), to calibrate the
predictions of the target samples according to the difficulty degree for each
class. Second, we further consider that the predictions of target samples
belonging to the hard class are vulnerable to perturbations. To prevent these
samples to be misclassified easily, we introduce Temporal-Ensembling (TE) and
Self-Ensembling (SE) to obtain consistent predictions. The proposed method is
evaluated in both unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) and semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA). The experimental results on several real-world
cross-domain benchmarks, including ImageCLEF, Office-31 and Office-Home,
substantiates the superiority of the proposed method.

formation rates of galaxies. One of the key parameters for the strength of RP
is the density of intra-group medium ($\rho_{\rm igm}$), which is difficult to
estimate if the X-ray emission from it is too weak to be observed. We propose a
new way to constrain $\rho_{\rm igm}$ through an application of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) to simulated gas density and kinematic maps galaxies
under strong RP. We train CNNs using $9\times{}10^4$ 2D images of galaxies
under various RP conditions, then validate performance with $10^4$ new test
images. This new method can be applied to real observational data from ongoing
WALLABY and SKA surveys to quickly obtain estimates of $\rho_{\rm igm}$.
Simulated galaxy images have $1.0$ kpc resolution, which is consistent with
that expected from the future WALLABY survey. The trained CNN models predict
the normalised IGM density, $\hat{\rho}_{\rm igm}$ where $0.0 \le
\hat{\rho}_{\rm igm, n} < 10.0$, accurately with root mean squared error values
($\rm RMSE$) of $0.72$, $0.83$ and $0.74$ for the density, kinematic and joined
2D maps, respectively. Trained models are unable to predict the relative
velocity of galaxies with respect to the IGM ($v_{\rm rel}$) precisely, and
struggle to generalise for different RP conditions. We apply our CNNs to the
observed HI column density map of NGC 1566 in the Dorado group to estimate its

a not-yet-identified periodicity. We performed an extensive multi-wavelength
campaign with the Effelsberg telescope, the Green Bank telescope and the
Arecibo Observatory to shadow the Gran Telescope Canaria (optical), NuSTAR
(X-ray) and INTEGRAL (gamma-ray). We detected 36 bursts with Effelsberg, one
with a pulse width of 39\,ms, the widest burst ever detected from FRB 121102.
With one burst detected during simultaneous NuSTAR observations, we place a
5-$\sigma$ upper limit of $5\times10^{47}$ erg on the 3--79\,keV energy of an
X-ray burst counterpart. We tested the periodicity hypothesis using 165-hr of
Effelsberg observations and find a periodicity of 161$\pm$5 days. We predict
the source to be active from 2020-07-09 to 2020-10-14 and subsequently from
2020-12-17 to 2021-03-24. We compare the wait times between consecutive bursts
within a single observation to Weibull and Poisson distributions. We conclude
that the strong clustering was indeed a consequence of a periodic activity and
show that if the few events with millisecond separation are excluded, the
arrival times are Poisson distributed. We model the bursts' cumulative energy
distribution with energies from ${\sim}10^{38}$-$10^{39}$ erg and find that it
is well described by a power-law with slope of $\gamma=-1.1\pm 0.2$. We propose

  Appearance","submitted to TIP",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Efficiently modeling dynamic motion information in videos is crucial for
action recognition task. Most state-of-the-art methods heavily rely on dense
optical flow as motion representation. Although combining optical flow with RGB
frames as input can achieve excellent recognition performance, the optical flow
extraction is very time-consuming. This undoubtably will count against
real-time action recognition. In this paper, we shed light on fast action
recognition by lifting the reliance on optical flow. Our motivation lies in the
observation that small displacements of motion boundaries are the most critical
ingredients for distinguishing actions, so we design a novel motion cue called
Persistence of Appearance (PA). In contrast to optical flow, our PA focuses
more on distilling the motion information at boundaries. Also, it is more
efficient by only accumulating pixel-wise differences in feature space, instead
of using exhaustive patch-wise search of all the possible motion vectors. Our
PA is over 1000x faster (8196fps vs. 8fps) than conventional optical flow in
terms of motion modeling speed. To further aggregate the short-term dynamics in
PA to long-term dynamics, we also devise a global temporal fusion strategy
called Various-timescale Aggregation Pooling (VAP) that can adaptively model
long-range temporal relationships across various timescales. We finally
incorporate the proposed PA and VAP to form a unified framework called
Persistent Appearance Network (PAN) with strong temporal modeling ability.
Extensive experiments on six challenging action recognition benchmarks verify
that our PAN outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods at low FLOPs. Codes

central role of the claustrum in mammalian forebrain structure and function.
However, relatively few in vivo studies of the claustrum exist in humans. A
reason for this may be the delicate and sheet-like structure of the claustrum
lying between the insular cortex and the putamen, which makes it not amenable
to conventional segmentation methods. Recently, Deep Learning (DL) based
approaches have been successfully introduced for automated segmentation of
complex, subcortical brain structures. In the following, we present a
multi-view DL-based approach to segment the claustrum in T1-weighted MRI scans.
We trained and evaluated the proposed method in 181 individuals, using
bilateral manual claustrum annotations by an expert neuroradiologist as the
reference standard. Cross-validation experiments yielded median volumetric
similarity, robust Hausdorff distance, and Dice score of 93.3%, 1.41mm, and
71.8%, respectively, representing equal or superior segmentation performance
compared to human intra-rater reliability. The leave-one-scanner-out evaluation
showed good transferability of the algorithm to images from unseen scanners at
slightly inferior performance. Furthermore, we found that DL-based claustrum
segmentation benefits from multi-view information and requires a sample size of
around 75 MRI scans in the training set. We conclude that the developed
algorithm allows for robust automated claustrum segmentation and thus yields
considerable potential for facilitating MRI-based research of the human
claustrum. The software and models of our method are made publicly available.

knowledge of the distributions of NMPs consistent with the fit data is

conditions, such as modified well locations and geometry, without the necessity
to recalculate each time the whole set of basis functions. Such an adaptive
technique allows us to significantly reduce the number of snapshots required to
calculate the new basis, and hence reduce the computational cost of the
simulations. The proposed method was applied to a two-dimensional immiscible
displacement model, and simulations were performed using a high resolution
model, a classical POD reduced model, and a reduced model whose POD basis was
adapted to varying well location and geometry. Numerical simulations show that
the proposed approach allows us to reduce the required number of model
snapshots by a few orders of magnitude compared to a classical POD scheme,
without noticeable loss of accuracy of calculated fluid production rates. Such

and collapse of the chirped pulse amplification (CPA) concept due to the loss
of usable bandwidth needed for safe temporal stretching. Avoiding the burst
amplification challenge and resorting to a lossy post-division of an isolated
laser pulse after CPA leaves the limitations of frequency- and time-domain
techniques unsolved. In this letter, we demonstrate an approach that
successfully combines amplitude and phase shaping of THz bursts, formed using
the Vernier effect, with active stabilization of spectral modes and efficient
energy extraction from a CPA regenerative amplifier. As proof of concept, the
amplified bursts of femtosecond near-infrared pulses are down-converted into
tunable THz-frequency pulses via optical rectification.

in the era of mobile Internet and sharing economy. It requires workers to
arrive at a particular location for task fulfillment. Effective protection of
location privacy is essential for workers' enthusiasm and valid task
assignment. However, existing SC models with differential privacy usually
perturb real-time location data for both partition and data publication. Such a
way may produce large perturbations to counting queries that affect assignment
success rate and allocation accuracy. This paper proposes a framework (R-HT)
for protecting location privacy of workers taking advantage of both real-time
and historical data. We simulate locations by sampling the probability
distribution learned from historical data, use them for grid partition, and
then publish real-time data under this partitioning with differential privacy.
This realizes that most privacy budget is allocated to the worker count of each
cell and yields an improved Private Spatial Decomposition approach. Moreover,
we introduce some strategies for geocast region construction, including quality
scoring function and local maximum geocast radius. A series of experimental
results on real-world datasets shows that R-HT attains a stable success rate of
task assignment, saves performance overhead and fits for dynamic assignment on
crowdsourcing platforms.

accretion that depletes material around the boundary. The inner edge of the
active depletion region is marked by the location of the maximum mass inflow
rate that separates a growing halo from the draining environment. This inner
depletion radius can also be interpreted as the radius enclosing a highly
complete population of splashback orbits, and matches the optimal exclusion
radius in a halo model of the large-scale structure. The minimum of the bias
trough defines a characteristic depletion radius, which is located within the
infall region bounded by the inner depletion radius and the turnaround radius,
while approaching the turnaround radius in low mass haloes that have stopped
mass accretion. The characteristic depletion radius depends the most on halo
mass and environment. It is approximately $2.5$ times the virial radius and
encloses an average density of $\sim 40$ times the background density of the
universe, independent on halo mass but dependent on other halo properties. The
inner depletion radius is smaller by $10-20\%$ and encloses an average density

directly the CISS effect in DNA hairpins contacted by two nonmagnetic leads at
both ends of the stem. Our results indicate that DNA hairpins present
pronounced CISS effect and the spin polarization could be enhanced by using
conducting molecules as the loop. In particular, DNA hairpins show several
intriguing features, which are different from other chiral molecules. First,
the local spin currents can flow circularly and assemble into a number of
vortex clusters when the electron energy locates in the left/right electronic
band of the stem. The chirality of vortex clusters in each band is the same and
will be reversed by switching the electron energy from the left band to the
right one, inducing the sign reversal of the spin polarization. Interestingly,
the local spin currents can be greater than the corresponding spin component of
the source-drain current. Second, both the conductance and the spin
polarization can increase with molecular length as well as dephasing strength,
contrary to the physical intuition that the transmission ability of molecular
wires should be poorer when suffering from stronger scattering. Third, we
unveil the optimal contact configuration of efficient electron transport and
that of the CISS effect, which are distinct from each other and can be
controlled by dephasing strength. The underlying physical mechanism is
illustrated.

is a structure theorem of quasi-quadratic modules in a subring $A$ of a
$2$-henselian valued field $(K,{\bf val})$ whose residue class field $F$ of

asserts that there exists a one-to-one correspondence between $\mathfrak X_A$

alleviate the problem of scale variation across object instances. These object
detectors, which strengthen features via a top-down pathway and lateral
connections, are mainly to enrich the semantic information of low-level
features, but ignore the enhancement of high-level features. This can lead to
an imbalance between different levels of features, in particular a serious lack
of detailed information in the high-level features, which makes it difficult to
get accurate bounding boxes. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-pronged
transductive idea to explore the relationship among different layers in both
backward and forward directions, which can enrich the semantic information of
low-level features and detailed information of high-level features at the same
time. Under the guidance of the two-pronged idea, we propose a Two-Pronged
Network (TPNet) to achieve bidirectional transfer between high-level features
and low-level features, which is useful for accurately detecting object at
different scales. Furthermore, due to the distribution imbalance between the
hard and easy samples in single-stage detectors, the gradient of localization
loss is always dominated by the hard examples that have poor localization
accuracy. This will enable the model to be biased toward the hard samples. So
in our TPNet, an adaptive IoU based localization loss, named Rectified IoU
(RIoU) loss, is proposed to rectify the gradients of each kind of samples. The
Rectified IoU loss increases the gradients of examples with high IoU while
suppressing the gradients of examples with low IoU, which can improve the
overall localization accuracy of model. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our TPNet and RIoU loss.

which constrains Siamese network to learn features that are aware of hard

a distance constraint, we force to shorten the distance between exemplar vector

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find an optimal architecture for the
binarization of CNNs. Due to the flexibility of this automated strategy, the
obtained architecture is not only suitable for binarization but also has low
overhead, achieving a better trade-off between the accuracy and computational
complexity of hand-optimized binary CNNs. The implementation of NASB strategy
is evaluated on the ImageNet dataset and demonstrated as a better solution

NASB outperforms existing single and multiple binary CNNs by up to 4.0% and

the larger context. In order to model the long term dependencies of words
across multiple sentences, we propose a novel architecture where the words from
prior utterances are converted to an embedding. The relevance of these
embeddings for the prediction of next word in the current sentence is found
using a gating network. The relevance weighted context embedding vector is
combined in the language model to improve the next word prediction, and the
entire model including the context embedding and the relevance weighting layers
is jointly learned for a conversational language modeling task. Experiments are
performed on two conversational datasets - AMI corpus and the Switchboard

significant improvements in language model perplexity over the RNNLM baseline.
In addition, the use of proposed conversational LM for ASR rescoring results in
absolute WER reduction of $1.2$\% on Switchboard dataset and $1.0$\% on AMI

signal processing, including WPE and beamforming, has no obvious contribution,

a specifically-designed data selection strategy, can lead to 2% EER reduction.

accounting for user-defined objectives/constraints for partitioning. This paper
presents Scission, a tool for automated benchmarking of DNNs on a given set of

maximize DNN performance. The decision-making approach is context-aware by
capitalizing on hardware capabilities of the target resources, their locality,
the characteristics of DNN layers, and the network condition. Experimental
studies are carried out on 18 DNNs. The decisions made by Scission cannot be
manually made by a human given the complexity and the number of dimensions

However, by framing imitation learning as a saddle point problem, adversarial
methods can suffer from unstable optimization, and convergence can only be
shown for small policy updates. We address these problems by proposing a
framework for non-adversarial imitation learning. The resulting algorithms are
similar to their adversarial counterparts and, thus, provide insights for
adversarial imitation learning methods. Most notably, we show that AIRL is an

show that our non-adversarial formulation can be used to derive novel

the initially empty cavities, the transfer of quantum correlations begins
immediately after the squeezed field is turned on, but it is delayed by a

the transfer of the quantum correlations is postponed until the one-photon

system ""waits"" for the population of the single-photon states to decay out
before starting to build up the quantum correlation between the cavities. The
delay time interval is independent of the number of photons initially present

be varied (controlled) when the cavities decay with different rates. It is
shown that the delayed transfer of the quantum correlation is directly related

allows the measurement of the coronal magnetic field strength in solar active
regions utilizing a handful of bright \ion[Fe x] and \ion[Fe xi] lines commonly
observed by the Hinode/EIS high-resolution spectrometer. The importance of this
new diagnostic technique lies in two basic facts: 1) the coronal magnetic field
is probably the most important quantity in coronal physics, as it is at the
heart of the processes regulating Space Weather and the properties of the solar
corona, and 2) this technique can be applied to the existing EIS archive
spanning from 2007 to 2020, including more than one full solar cycle and
covering a large number of active regions, flares, and even coronal mass
ejections. This new diagnostic technique opens the door to a whole new field of
studies, complementing the magnetic field measurements from the upcoming DKIST
and UCoMP ground based observatories, and extending our reach to active regions
observed on the disk and until now only sampled by radio measurements. In this
work we present a few examples of the application of this technique to EIS
observations taken at different times during the EIS mission, discuss its
current limitations and the steps to improve its accuracy. We also present a
list of EIS observing sequences whose data include all the lines necessary for
the application of this diagnostic technique, to help the solar community
navigate the immense set of EIS data and to find observations suitable to
measure the coronal magnetic field.

sophisticated computer codes that map parameters or inputs to an underlying
physical process. In other situations, experimental setups are used to model
the physical process in a laboratory, ensuring high precision while being
costly in materials and logistics. In both scenarios, only limited amount of
data can be generated by querying the expensive information source at a finite
number of inputs or designs. This problem is compounded further in the presence
of a high-dimensional input space. State-of-the-art parameter space dimension
reduction methods, such as active subspace, aim to identify a subspace of the
original input space that is sufficient to explain the output response. These
methods are restricted by their reliance on gradient evaluations or copious
data, making them inadequate to expensive problems without direct access to
gradients. The proposed methodology is gradient-free and fully Bayesian, as it
quantifies uncertainty in both the low-dimensional subspace and the surrogate
model parameters. This enables a full quantification of epistemic uncertainty
and robustness to limited data availability. It is validated on multiple
datasets from engineering and science and compared to two other
state-of-the-art methods based on four aspects: a) recovery of the active

pipe flow. We apply explicit spatial filtering of DNS data and assess the
effect of different filter kernels (Fourier, Gauss, box) on the local structure
of the inter-scale energy flux ($\Pi$) and its statistics. Qualitatively, the
mean energy flux at each wall-normal distance is robust with respect to the
filter kernel, whereas there are significant differences in the estimated
intensity and distribution of localised $\Pi$ events. We find conflicting
correlations between typical flow structures in the buffer layer (streaks,
vortices and different $Q$ events) and regions of forward/backward transfer in
the instantaneous $\Pi$ field. In particular, cross-correlations are highly
upstream-downstream symmetric for the Fourier kernel, but asymmetric for the
Gauss and box kernel. We show that for the Gauss and box kernel, $\Pi$ events
preferably sit on the inclined meander at the borders of streaks where strong
shear layers occur, whereas they appear centred on top of the streaks for the
Fourier kernel. Moreover, using the Fourier kernel we reveal a direct
coincidence of backward scatter and fluid transport away from the wall
($Q_{1}$), which is absent for the Gauss and the box kernel. However, all
kernels equally predict backward scatter directly downstream of $Q_{1}$ events.
Our findings expand the common understanding of the wall cycle and might impact
modelling and control strategies. Altogether, our results suggest that
interpretations of the inter-scale energy flux relying on Fourier filters
should be taken with caution, because Fourier filters act globally in physical
space, whereas $\Pi$ events are strongly spatially localised. Our Python
post-processing tool eFlux for scale separation and flux computations in pipe
flows is freely available and can be easily adapted to other flow geometries.

Metvix-PDT under 625 nm, 660 nm and their combination light, for a fixed
radiant exposure. The therapeutic outcome was assessed through Monte Carlo
based computational simulations along with a preliminary in vivo study, where
fluorescence, size and temperature measurements were conducted. Results: The
light source combination protocol presents great potential, since it results in
high cytotoxic products levels and reduced treatment times; while the in vivo
findings, regarding the harvested tumor mass, also support this hypothesis. The
irradiation with 625 nm beam alone presented better results for most of the in
vivo measured parameters. The mouse treated with only the 660 nm light source
had the highest un-photobleached photosensitizer (PS) signal, the lowest body
temperature, the heaviest harvested tumor and the lowest estimated
concentration of PDT cytotoxic products. Conclusions: The use of 625 nm
irradiation light matches the PS excitation band but is preferable only for
treatment of superficial tumors. For deeper laying masses, the simultaneous use
of longer wavelengths enhances the therapeutic outcome due to their increased
penetration depth.

mining. The core principle of feature selection seems to be to pick a subset of
possible features by excluding features with almost no predictive information
as well as highly associated redundant features. In the past several years, a
variety of meta-heuristic methods were introduced to eliminate redundant and
irrelevant features as much as possible from high-dimensional datasets. Among
the main disadvantages of present meta-heuristic based approaches is that they
are often neglecting the correlation between a set of selected features. In
this article, for the purpose of feature selection, the authors propose a
genetic algorithm based on community detection, which functions in three steps.
The feature similarities are calculated in the first step. The features are
classified by community detection algorithms into clusters throughout the
second step. In the third step, features are picked by a genetic algorithm with
a new community-based repair operation. Nine benchmark classification problems
were analyzed in terms of the performance of the presented approach. Also, the
authors have compared the efficiency of the proposed approach with the findings

offer us a huge amount of information of the early universe. They reside on the
future boundary of a de Sitter space and can be calculated by two methods.
First method involves our old Lagrangian picture where we evaluate the bulk
time integrals to find the correlator at the future boundary. The other method
which is our main topic of interest is to find the correlators by imposing
constraints from symmetries and singularities on the future boundary.
Particularly, we obtain the differential equation satisfied by the correlator
by imposing de Sitter isometries which act on the future boundary just like the
conformal symmetry. Then we analytically solve this differential equation by
imposing boundary conditions coming from the correct normalization of the
physical singularities and absence of the unphysical ones. In the process we
see emergence of the effects of time dependent background like particle
production and also obtain their observable signatures in the correlators.
Finally we compare our analytical solution with the numerical ones.

in Bianchi I universe using the Regge-Wheeler gauge. In this gauge, there are
only two non-zero components of $ h_{\mu\nu} $ in the case of axial waves:
$h_0(t,r)$ and $h_1(t,r)$. The field equations in absence of matter have been
derived both for the unperturbed as well as axially perturbed metric. These
field equations are solved simultaneously by assuming the expansion scalar
$\Theta$ to be proportional to the shear scalar $\sigma$ (so that $a= b^n$,
where $a$, $b$ are the metric coefficients and $n$ is an arbitrary constant),
and the wave equation for the perturbation parameter $h_0(t,r)$ have been
derived. We used the method of separation of variables to solve for this
parameter, and have subsequently determined $h_1(t,r)$. We then discuss a few
special cases in order to interpret the results. We find that the anisotropy of
the background spacetime is responsible for the damping of the gravitational
waves as they propagate through this spacetime. The perturbations depend on the
values of the angular momentum $l$. The field equations in the presence of
matter reveal that the axially perturbed spacetime leads to perturbations only
in the azimuthal velocity of the fluid leaving the matter field undisturbed.

Different from other short-term traffic forecasting methods, the short-term OD
flow prediction possesses three unique characteristics: (1) data availability:
real-time OD flow is not available during the prediction; (2) data
dimensionality: the dimension of the OD flow is much higher than the
cardinality of transportation networks; (3) data sparsity: URT OD flow is
spatiotemporally sparse. There is a great need to develop novel OD flow
forecasting method that explicitly considers the unique characteristics of the
URT system. To this end, a channel-wise attentive split-convolutional neural

particular, an inflow/outflow-gated mechanism is innovatively introduced to

analysis of stock market data have represented an essential role in today's
economy, and a significant challenge to the specialist since the market's
tendencies are immensely complex, chaotic and are developed within a highly
dynamic environment. There are numerous researches from multiple areas
intending to take on that challenge, and Machine Learning approaches have been
the focus of many of them. There are multiple models of Machine Learning
algorithms been able to obtain competent outcomes doing that class of
foresight. This paper proposes the implementation of a generative adversarial
network (GAN), which is composed by a bi-directional Long short-term memory
(LSTM) and convolutional neural network(CNN) referred as Bi-LSTM-CNN to
generate synthetic data that agree with existing real financial data so the
features of stocks with positive or negative trends can be retained to predict
future trends of a stock. The novelty of this proposed solution that distinct
from previous solutions is that this paper introduced the concept of a hybrid
system (Bi-LSTM-CNN) rather than a sole LSTM model. It was collected data from
multiple stock markets such as TSX, SHCOMP, KOSPI 200 and the S&P 500,
proposing an adaptative-hybrid system for trends prediction on stock market
prices, and carried a comprehensive evaluation on several commonly utilized
machine learning prototypes, and it is concluded that the proposed solution
approach outperforms preceding models. Additionally, during the research stage
from preceding works, gaps were found between investors and researchers who
dedicated to the technical domain.

network construction method (DDFEN), which combined the detrended
cross-correlation analysis coefficient (DCCC) and the network deconvolution
method together. DDFEN is designed to reveal the `true' correlation of
currencies by filtering indirect effects in the foreign exchange networks
(FXNs). The empirical results show that DDFEN can reflect the change of
currency status in the long term and also perform more stable than traditional
network construction methods.

perfect number that was introduced by Zumkeller in 2003. The positive integer
$n$ is a Zumkeller number if its divisors can be partitioned into two sets with
the same sum, which will be $\sigma(n)/2$. Generalizing even further, we call
$n$ a $k$-layered number if its divisors can be partitioned into $k$ sets with
equal sum.
  In this paper, we completely characterize Zumkeller numbers with two distinct
prime factors and give some bounds for prime factorization in case of Zumkeller
numbers with more than two distinct prime factors. We also characterize
$k$-layered numbers with two distinct prime factors and even $k$-layered
numbers with more than two distinct odd prime factors. Some other results
concerning these numbers and their relationship with practical numbers and
Harmonic mean numbers are also discussed.

services. An increase in social media usage has also been observed, leading to
the suspicion that this has also raised cyberbullying. In this initial work, we
explore the possibility of an increase in cyberbullying incidents due to the
pandemic and high social media usage. To evaluate this trend, we collected
454,046 cyberbullying-related public tweets posted between January 1st, 2020 --
June 7th, 2020. We summarize the tweets containing multiple keywords into their
daily counts. Our analysis showed the existence of at most one statistically
significant changepoint for most of these keywords, which were primarily
located around the end of March. Almost all these changepoint time-locations
can be attributed to COVID-19, which substantiates our initial hypothesis of an
increase in cyberbullying through analysis of discussions over Twitter.

  2020",,,"cs.SI cs.CY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  COVID-19's impact has surpassed from personal and global health to our social
life. In terms of digital presence, it is speculated that during pandemic,
there has been a significant rise in cyberbullying. In this paper, we have
examined the hypothesis of whether cyberbullying and reporting of such
incidents have increased in recent times. To evaluate the speculations, we
collected cyberbullying related public tweets (N=454,046) posted between
January 1st, 2020 -- June 7th, 2020. A simple visual frequentist analysis
ignores serial correlation and does not depict changepoints as such. To address
correlation and a relatively small number of time points, Bayesian estimation
of the trends is proposed for the collected data via an autoregressive Poisson
model. We show that this new Bayesian method detailed in this paper can clearly
show the upward trend on cyberbullying-related tweets since mid-March 2020.
However, this evidence itself does not signify a rise in cyberbullying but
shows a correlation of the crisis with the discussion of such incidents by
individuals. Our work emphasizes a critical issue of cyberbullying and how a
global crisis impacts social media abuse and provides a trend analysis model
that can be utilized for social media data analysis in general.
