of directly imaged exoplanets, to theoretical models of planetary atmospheres,
and to other transiting exoplanets. Using a selection of near- and mid-infrared

Additionally, we present evidence that observed differences in the

dwarfs, might be attributed to phosphine, which is susceptible to photolysis.
The presence of phosphine in low irradiation environments may negate the need

regions with higher curvature and we apply a recursive algorithm to refine the
previous selected regions. Finally, we obtain a concave point from each region

breakup of two identical droplets entering a Y-junction with controlled spatial
offset by which the second droplet trails the first. Based on fully resolved 3D
simulations, we describe the flow physics leading to breakup. Scaling
arguments, numerical simulation and experiments consistently show that for
small initial offset, breakup always occurs with the droplet fragment volume
depending linearly on the offset. Above a critical offset, which increases with
the capillary number, the droplets enter the constriction sequentially without
breakup. Our results are relevant for understanding the breakup behavior in a
dense emulsion flowing through a linearly converging channel leading to a
constriction. Such geometry is commonly used for the serial interrogation of
droplet content in droplet microfluidic applications, where droplet breakup can
limit the maximum throughput for such process. For capillary numbers up to
$Ca\simeq10^{-2}$, the results from the two-droplet system in a Y-junction are
consistent with breakup observations in dense emulsions flowing through a
linearly converging channel. The deterministic relation between initial offset
and resulting breakup in the two-droplet system suggests that the stochasticity
that is observed in the breakup of a dense emulsion arises from multi-droplet
interactions. The numerical value of the prefactor in the linear relation
between initial offset and droplet fragment volume determined from experiments
differs slightly from the one extracted from fully resolved numerical
simulations. This discrepancy suggests that even at very high bulk surfactant
concentrations, the rate-limiting surfactant adsorption kinetics allows for
Marangoni stresses to develop and modify the droplet dynamics.

lanthanide ions in He and Ar agree well, and they are remarkably sensitive to
the electronic configuration of the ion, namely, whether the outer electronic
shells are 6s, 5d6s or 6s$^2$. The previous theoretical work is extended here
to ions of the actinide family with zero electron orbital momentum: Ac$^+$
(7s$^2$, $^1$S), Am$^+$ (5f$^7$7s $^9$S$^\circ$), Cm$^+$ (5f$^7$7s$^2$
$^8$S$^\circ$), No$^+$ (5f$^{14}$7s $^2$S) and Lr$^+$ (5f$^{14}$7s$^2$ $^1$S).
The calculations reveal large systematic differences in the mobilities of the
7s and 7s$^2$ groups of ions and other similarities with their lanthanide
analogs. The correlation of ion-neutral interaction potentials and mobility
variations with spatial parameters of the electron distributions in the bare
ions is explored through the ionic radii concept. While the qualitative trends
found for interaction potentials and mobilities render them appealing for
superheavy ion research, lack of experimental data and limitations of the
scalar relativistic ab initio approaches in use make further efforts necessary
to bring the transport measurements into the inventory of techniques operating
in ''one atom at a time'' mode.

previous studies show that pre-training convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on
fully-visible (non-occluded) faces improves the accuracy, we propose to employ
knowledge distillation to achieve further improvements. First of all, we employ
the classic teacher-student training strategy, in which the teacher is a CNN
trained on fully-visible faces and the student is a CNN trained on occluded
faces. Second of all, we propose a new approach for knowledge distillation
based on triplet loss. During training, the goal is to reduce the distance
between an anchor embedding, produced by a student CNN that takes occluded
faces as input, and a positive embedding (from the same class as the anchor),
produced by a teacher CNN trained on fully-visible faces, so that it becomes
smaller than the distance between the anchor and a negative embedding (from a
different class than the anchor), produced by the student CNN. Third of all, we
propose to combine the distilled embeddings obtained through the classic
teacher-student strategy and our novel teacher-student strategy based on
triplet loss into a single embedding vector. We conduct experiments on two
benchmarks, FER+ and AffectNet, with two CNN architectures, VGG-f and VGG-face,
showing that knowledge distillation can bring significant improvements over the

high-dimensional neuronal and behavioral data that are characterized by
different statistics and timescales of the recorded variables. We propose a
parametric copula model which separates the statistics of the individual
variables from their dependence structure, and escapes the curse of
dimensionality by using vine copula constructions. We use a Bayesian framework
with Gaussian Process (GP) priors over copula parameters, conditioned on a
continuous task-related variable. We validate the model on synthetic data and
compare its performance in estimating mutual information against the commonly
used non-parametric algorithms.
  Our model provides accurate information estimates when the dependencies in
the data match the parametric copulas used in our framework. When the exact
density estimation with a parametric model is not possible, our Copula-GP model
is still able to provide reasonable information estimates, close to the ground
truth and comparable to those obtained with a neural network estimator.
Finally, we apply our framework to real neuronal and behavioral recordings
obtained in awake mice. We demonstrate the ability of our framework to
  1) produce accurate and interpretable bivariate models for the analysis of
inter-neuronal noise correlations or behavioral modulations;
  2) expand to more than 100 dimensions and measure information content in the
whole-population statistics. These results demonstrate that the Copula-GP

seen significant attention. However, most of this work has focused on
concurrent data structures providing good \emph{worst-case} guarantees. In real
workloads, objects are often accessed at different rates, since access
distributions may be non-uniform. Efficient distribution-adaptive data
structures are known in the sequential case, e.g. the splay-trees; however,
they often are hard to translate efficiently in the concurrent case.
  In this paper, we investigate distribution-adaptive concurrent data
structures and propose a new design called the splay-list. At a high level, the
splay-list is similar to a standard skip-list, with the key distinction that
the height of each element adapts dynamically to its access rate: popular
elements ``move up,'' whereas rarely-accessed elements decrease in height. We
show that the splay-list provides order-optimal amortized complexity bounds for
a subset of operations while being amenable to efficient concurrent
implementation. Experimental results show that the splay-list can leverage
distribution-adaptivity to improve on the performance of classic concurrent
designs, and can outperform the only previously-known distribution-adaptive
design in certain settings.

class $\mathcal{S}$ using a budget of $R$ bits, as $R\to\infty$. We say that
$\mathcal{S}$ can be compressed at rate $s$ if we can achieve an error of
$\mathcal{O}(R^{-s})$ for encoding $\mathcal{S}$; the supremal compression rate
is denoted $s^\ast(\mathcal{S})$. Given a fixed coding scheme, there usually
are elements of $\mathcal{S}$ that are compressed at a higher rate than
$s^\ast(\mathcal{S})$ by the given coding scheme; we study the size of this set
of signals. We show that for certain ""nice"" signal classes $\mathcal{S}$, a

two modalities. We first collect paired design drafts and real fashion item
images without pixel-wise alignment. To solve the misalignment problem, our
main idea is to train a sampling network to adaptively adjust the input to an
intermediate state with structure alignment to the output. Moreover, built upon
the sampling network, we present design draft to real fashion item translation
network (D2RNet), where two separate translation streams that focus on texture
and shape, respectively, are combined tactfully to get both benefits. D2RNet is
able to generate realistic garments with both texture and shape consistency to
their design drafts. We show that this idea can be effectively applied to the
reverse translation problem and present R2DNet accordingly. Extensive

the scale separation between the Ozmidov scale and the viscous or resistive

the definition of critical buoyancy and magnetic buoyancy Reynolds numbers for
stratified small-scale dynamo onset in the high and low magnetic Prandtl number

kinks and antikinks in $\phi^4$ theory and sine-Gordon theory are reconsidered.
The field theory Lagrangian restricted to moduli space defines a reduced
Lagrangian, combining a potential with a kinetic term that can be interpreted
as a Riemannian metric on moduli space. Moduli spaces should be metrically
complete, or have an infinite potential on their boundary. Examples are
constructed for both kink-antikink and kink-antikink-kink configurations. The
naive position coordinates of the kinks and antikinks sometimes need to be
extended from real to imaginary values, although the field remains real. The
previously discussed null-vector problem for the shape modes of $\phi^4$ kinks
is resolved by a better coordinate choice. In sine-Gordon theory, moduli spaces
can be constructed using exact solutions at the critical energy separating
scattering and breather (or wobble) solutions; here, energy conservation
relates the metric and potential. The reduced dynamics on these moduli spaces
accurately reproduces properties of the exact solutions over a range of
energies.

The accuracy hereby depends on many factors, including the spatial resolution
of the imaging technique. 3D Polarized Light Imaging (3D-PLI) allows the
three-dimensional reconstruction of nerve fiber tracts in whole brain sections
with micrometer in-plane resolution, but leaves uncertainties in pixels
containing crossing fibers. Here we introduce Scattered Light Imaging (SLI) to
resolve the substructure of nerve fiber crossings. The measurement is performed
on the same unstained histological brain sections as in 3D-PLI. By illuminating
the brain sections from different angles and measuring the transmitted
(scattered) light under normal incidence, SLI provides information about the
underlying nerve fiber structure. A fully automated evaluation of the resulting
light intensity profiles has been developed, allowing the user to extract
various characteristics, like the individual directions of in-plane crossing
nerve fibers, for each image pixel at once. We validate the reconstructed nerve
fiber directions against results from previous simulation studies,
scatterometry measurements, and fiber directions obtained from 3D-PLI. We
demonstrate in different brain samples (human optic tracts, vervet monkey
brain, rat brain) that the 2D fiber directions can be reliably reconstructed
for up to three crossing nerve fiber bundles in each image pixel with an
in-plane resolution of up to 6.5 $\mu$m. We show that SLI also yields reliable
fiber directions in brain regions with low 3D-PLI signals coming from regions
with a low density of myelinated nerve fibers or out-of-plane fibers. In
combination with 3D-PLI, the technique can be used for a full reconstruction of

important and all-encompassing nonlinear phenomenon. Yet, we do not have a good
control over all the signals generated in this process. Usually a large part of
an octave spanning spectrum has orders of magnitude too much weaker signal than
the peak to be useful for any application. In this work we show strong signal
generation within a supercontinuum using a silicon Bragg grating waveguide. We
show up to 23 dB of signal enhancement over a 10 nm full-width-at-half-maximum
bandwidth at the Bragg resonance in the telecom window. Since the grating is
made by depositing charge carriers periodically, thus avoiding any dimensional
change in the waveguide, it can allow other functionalities offered by the
induced electric field, such as second harmonic generation. The ease of grating
fabrication, whether with dimensional variation or doping, makes such a device
useful for enhancing signal strength at any desired frequencies with high
precision within a supercontinuum independent of material platform. We believe
this work opens a new avenue for supercontinuum enhancement on demand in

effects of radiation damage in amorphous zirconolite and have developed a new
way to analyse the damaged structure in terms of local coordination statistics.
On the basis of this analysis, we find that the amorphous structure responds to
radiation damage differently from the crystal. Amorphous zirconolite is found
to be ""softer"" than crystalline zirconolite with a much larger number of atoms
becoming displaced and changing coordination during a 70 keV cascade. The local
coordination and connectivity analysis shows that the amorphous structure
continues to evolve as a result of repeated radiation damage, changes which
cannot be identified from globally averaged properties such as pair
distribution functions. We also find large density inhomogeneities at the local
level which we suggest may play an important role for future developments in
nuclear waste storage. Finally, we find a correlation between the changes in
enthalpy and local coordination, suggesting that measurements of enthalpy
change can be linked quantitatively to structural radiation damage. Our results
raise an interesting possibility of whether an evolution of the amorphous
structure due to radiation damage can converge to a new equilibrium amorphous
regime, posing the fundamental question of what that structure may be.

the ground-state of $N$ noninteracting spinless fermions in a general potential
in arbitrary dimensions $d$ (central for $d>1$). In a confining potential, the
Fermi gas is supported over a bounded domain. In $d=1$, for specific
potentials, this system is related to standard random matrix ensembles. We
study the quantum fluctuations of the number of fermions ${\cal N}_{\cal D}$ in
a domain $\cal{D}$ of macroscopic size in the bulk of the support. We show that
the variance of ${\cal N}_{\cal D}$ grows as $N^{(d-1)/d} (A_d \log N + B_d)$
for large $N$, and obtain the explicit dependence of $A_d, B_d$ on the
potential and on the size of ${\cal D}$ (for a spherical domain in $d>1$). This
generalizes the free-fermion results for microscopic domains, given in $d=1$ by
the Dyson-Mehta asymptotics from random matrix theory. This leads us to
conjecture similar asymptotics for the entanglement entropy of the subsystem
$\cal{D}$, in any dimension, supported by exact results for $d=1$.

artifacts alongside their research papers. Ideally, artifacts, including tools,
benchmarks, and data, support the dissemination of ideas, provide evidence for
research claims, and serve as a starting point for future research. However, in
practice, artifacts suffer from a variety of issues that prevent the
realization of their full potential.
  To help the software engineering community realize the full potential of
artifacts, we seek to understand the challenges involved in the creation,
sharing, and use of artifacts. To that end, we perform a mixed-methods study
including a survey of artifacts in software engineering publications, and an
online survey of 153 software engineering researchers. By analyzing the
perspectives of artifact creators, users, and reviewers, we identify several
high-level challenges that affect the quality of artifacts including mismatched
expectations between these groups, and a lack of sufficient reward for both
creators and reviewers. Using Diffusion of Innovations as an analytical
framework, we examine how these challenges relate to one another, and build an
understanding of the factors that affect the sharing and success of artifacts.
Finally, we make recommendations to improve the quality of artifacts based on
our results and existing best practices.

cations. In addition to solute size and polarizability, the intrinsic structure
of the unperturbed interface has been discussed as an important contributor to
this bias. Here we assess quantitatively the role that intrinsic charge
asymmetry of water's surface plays in ion adsorption, using computer
simulations to compare model solutes of various size and charge. In doing so,
we also evaluate the degree to which linear response theory for solvent
polarization is a reasonable approach for comparing the thermodynamics of bulk
and interfacial ion solvation. Consistent with previous works on bulk ion
solvation, we find that the average electrostatic potential at the center of a
neutral, sub-nanometer solute at the air-water interface depends sensitively on
its radius, and that this potential changes quite nonlinearly as the solute's
charge is introduced. The nonlinear response closely resembles that of the
bulk. As a result, the net nonlinearity of ion adsorption is weaker than in
bulk, but still substantial, comparable to the apparent magnitude of
macroscopically nonlocal contributions from the undisturbed interface. For the
simple-point-charge model of water we study, these results argue distinctly
against rationalizing ion adsorption in terms of surface potentials inherent to
molecular structure of the liquid's boundary.

Raman features at ~ 800 $cm^{-1}$ and ~ 1400 $cm^{-1}$ arising from magnetic
excitations. Unconventionally, the ~ 800 $cm^{-1}$ feature is fully symmetric
($A_{1g}$) with respect to the underlying tetragonal ($D_{4h}$) crystal lattice
which, together with its broad line shape, definitively rules out the
possibility of a single magnon excitation as its origin. In contrast, the ~
1400 $cm^{-1}$ feature shows up in both the $A_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ channels.
From spin wave and two-magnon scattering cross-section calculations of a

further found that this zone-center two-magnon scattering is unique to bilayer

two-magnon mode is distinct in symmetry from the time-reversal symmetry broken

method that combines orthogonal collocation on the local rod curvature and
forward integration of the Cosserat rod kinematic equations via the Magnus

exponentials. We provide a bound on the maximum step size to guarantee
convergence of the Magnus expansion for the case of Cosserat rods, compare in
simulation against other approaches, and demonstrate the tradeoffs between
speed and accuracy for the fourth and sixth order Magnus expansions as well as
for different numbers of collocation points. Our results show that the proposed

existing MARL methods either limit representation expressiveness of their value

presents a novel MARL approach, called duPLEX dueling multi-agent Q-learning

approximations of both the QoI and its gradients simultaneously with
uncertainty estimates. We compare this method with the conventional
multi-fidelity Cokriging method that does not use gradients information, and
the result suggests that GE-Cokriging has a better performance in predicting
both QoI and its gradients. Moreover, GE-Cokriging even shows better
generalization result in some cases where Cokriging performs poorly due to the
singularity of the covariance matrix. We demonstrate the application of
GE-Cokriging in several practical cases including reconstructing the
trajectories and velocity of an underdamped oscillator with respect to time
simultaneously, and investigating the sensitivity of power factor of a load bus
with respect to varying power inputs of a generator bus in a large scale power
system. We also show that though GE-Cokriging method requires a little bit
higher computational cost than Cokriging method, the result of accuracy
comparison shows that this cost is usually worth it.

excitation of the outer orbit eccentricities. We study the cumulative effect of
such flybys, and show them to be conductive for the production of
gravitational-wave (GW) sources. Flyby encounters with TBHs can turn the TBHs
unstable and follow chaotic evolution. This leads to a binary-single resonant
encounter between the outer BH and the inner-binary. These encounters can
result in either a prompt GW-merger of two of the TBH components during the
resonant phase, or the disruption of the TBH. In the latter case a more compact
binary is left behind, while the third BH escapes and is ejected. The compact
remnant binary may still inspiral through GW-emission, although on longer
timescales. A significant number of these would lead to a delayed GW-merger in
less than a Hubble time. We find a volumetric merger rate of $\sim3-10{\rm

of charmonia, was observed in LHCb. The data also reveals a broader structure
centered around 6490 MeV and suggests another unconfirmed resonance centered at
around 7240 MeV, very near to the threshold of two doubly charmed $\Xi_{cc}$
baryons. We argue in this note that these exotic hadrons are genuine
tetraquarks and not molecules of charmonia. It is conjectured that they are
V-baryonium tetraquarks, namely, have an inner structure of a baryonic vertex
with a $cc$ diquark attached to it, which is connected by a string to an
anti-baryonic vertex with a $\bar c \bar c$ anti-diquark. We examine these
states as the analogs of the states $\Psi(4360)$ and $Y(4630)$/$\Psi(4660)$
which are charmonium-like tetraquarks. One way to test these claims is by
searching for a significant decay of the state at 7.2 GeV into
$\Xi_{cc}\overline\Xi_{cc}$. Such a decay would be the analog of the decay of
the state $Y(4630)$ into to $\Lambda_c\overline\Lambda_c$. We further argue
that there should be trajectories of both orbital and radial excited states of
the $X(6900)$. We predict their masses. It is possible that a few of these
states have already been seen by LHCb.

disrupted GC stars of the order of 27.5$^{+15.4}_{-11.5}$$\%$ at r = 1.5 kpc

Moreover, to more physically detect the differences between the nucleon-nucleon

that in the total density-dependent scenario through fitting the identical
constraints for symmetric nuclear matter as well as the identical slope

that two density-dependent scenarios also lead to essentially different
symmetry potentials especially at high densities although they can lead to the
identical equation of state for the symmetry nuclear matter as well as the
identical symmetry energy for the isospin asymmetric nuclear matter.
Consequently, these isospin-sensitive observables are also appreciably affected

distinct populations: those that are more likely to be terrestrials

($\gtrsim2R_\oplus$). There exists a clear gap in the distribution of radii
that separates these two kinds of planets. Mass loss processes like
photoevaporation by high energy photons from the host star have been proposed
as natural mechanisms to carve out this radius valley. These models favor
underlying core mass function of sub-Neptunes that is sharply peaked at
$\sim$4--8$M_\oplus$ but the radial-velocity follow-up of these small planets
hint at a more bottom-heavy mass function. By taking into account the initial
gas accretion in gas-poor (but not gas-empty) nebula, we demonstrate that 1)
the observed radius valley is a robust feature that is initially carved out at
formation during late-time gas accretion; and 2) that it can be reconciled with
core mass functions that are broad extending well into sub-Earth regime. The
maximally cooled isothermal limit prohibits cores lighter than
$\sim$1--2$M_\oplus$ from accreting enough mass to appear gas-enveloped. The
rocky-to-enveloped transition established at formation produces a gap in the
radius distribution that shifts to smaller radii farther from the star, similar
to that observed. For the best agreement with the data, our late-time gas
accretion model favors dust-free accretion in hotter disks with cores slightly
less dense than the Earth ($\sim$0.8$\rho_\oplus$) drawn from a mass function

focus, as an example, on the $D=3$, $\mathcal{N}=2$ Wess-Zumino model with
cubic superpotential $W=XYZ+\frac{\tau}{6}(X^3+Y^3+Z^3)$, and compute
$\Delta(Q_R,\tau)$ using the $\epsilon$-expansion in three interesting limits.
In two of these limits the (leading order) result turns out to be
\begin{equation*}
  \Delta(Q_R,\tau)=
  \begin{cases}
  \left(\text{BPS bound}\right)\left[1+O(\epsilon |\tau|^2Q_R)\right], & Q_R\ll

$R$-charge. This smooth transition, happening near $\tau=0$, is a
large-$R$-charge manifestation of the existence of a moduli space and an
infinite chiral ring at $\tau=0$. We also argue that this behavior can be
extended to three dimensions with minimal modifications, and so we conclude
that $\Delta(Q_R,\tau)$ experiences a smooth transition around $Q_R\sim
1/|\tau|^2$. Additionally, we find a first-order phase transition for
$\Delta(Q_R,\tau)$ as a function of $\tau$, as a consequence of the duality of

demonstrate that the systematics associated with cluster gravitational
potentials are smaller than the hydrostatic mass bias and that cluster
potentials could therefore be a good alternative to cluster masses in
cosmological studies. Methods. Using cosmological simulations of galaxy
clusters, we compute the biases in the hydrostatic mass (HE mass) and those in
the gravitational potential, reconstructed from measurements at X-ray and
millimeter wavelengths. In particular, we investigate the effects of the
presence of substructures and of non-thermal pressure support on both the HE
mass and the reconstructed potential. Results. We find that the bias in the
reconstructed potential (6%) is less than that of the HE mass (13%), and that
the scatter in the reconstructed potential decreases by about 35% with respect
to that in the HE mass. Conclusions. This study shows that characterizing
galaxy clusters by their gravitational potential is a promising alternative to

density distribution function to estimate their mass loss rates. Our mass loss
rate -- luminosity relation for 42 RSGs basically follows the classical de
Jager curve, but at luminosities below 10^5 Solar luminosities we find a
significant population of red supergiants with mass loss rate below the de

transition to higher mass loss rates that approximates and overlaps the de
Jager curve. We recommend that instead of using a linear relation or single
curve, the empirical mass loss rate -- luminosity relation is better
represented by a broad band. Interestingly, the transition to much higher mass
loss rates at about 10^5 Lsun corresponds approximately to an initial mass of
18 --20 Msun which is close to the upper limit for RSGs becoming Type II SNe.

split-off band's states: Even for a spin-orbit energy as large as 1 eV, that
mixing induces first-order modifications of properties such as the spin value
and anisotropy, the oscillator strength, and the electron-hole exchange, for
which we extend the description to the light-hole exciton. CdTe/ZnTe quantum

new physics with a significance of up to $4\,\sigma$, depending on the
theoretical input used, and can be explained through modified $W$ couplings to
leptons. In this context, vector-like leptons (VLLs) are prime candidates for a
corresponding UV completion since they can affect $W\ell\nu$ couplings at
tree-level, such that this modification can have the dominant phenomenological
impact. In order to consistently asses the agreement with the data, a global
fit is necessary which we perform for gauge-invariant dimension-6 operators and
all patterns obtained for the six possible representations (under the SM gauge
group) of VLLs. We find that even in the lepton flavour universal case,
including the measurements of the CKM elements $V_{us}$ and $V_{ud}$ into the
electroweak fit has a relevant impact, shifting the best fit point
significantly. Concerning the VLLs we discuss the bounds from charged lepton
flavour violating processes and observe that a single representation cannot
describe experimental data significantly better than the SM hypothesis.
However, allowing for several representations of VLLs at the same time, we find
that the simple scenario in which $N$ couples to electrons via the Higgs and
$\Sigma_1$ couples to muons not only explains the CAA but also improves the
rest of the electroweak fit in such a way that its best fit point is preferred
by more than $4\,\sigma$ with respect to the SM.

cosmological fast radio bursts (FRBs) arise from magnetar bursts. We argue that
the X-ray bursts with high temperature $T \gtrsim 30$ keV entail an
electron--positron ($e^{\pm}$) outflow from a trapped--expanding fireball,
polluting the NS magnetosphere before the FRB emission. The $e^{\pm}$ outflow
is opaque to FRB photons, and is strongly Compton-dragged by the X-ray bursts.
Nevertheless, the FRB photons can break out of the $e^{\pm}$ outflow with
radiation forces if the FRB emission radius is larger than a few tens of NS
radii. A FRB is choked if the FRB is weaker or the X-ray bursts are stronger,
possibly explaining why there are no FRBs with giant flares and no detectable
X-ray bursts with weak FRBs. We also speculate that the $e^{\pm}$ outflow may
be inevitable for FRBs, solving the problem of why the FRBs occur only with
high-$T$ X-ray bursts. The breakout physics is important for constraining the

observable radiation. We separately consider the cases where gas circularizes
rapidly into an accretion disc, as well as the case when shocked debris streams
provide the observable emission without having fully circularized. For the
rapid circularization case, we describe how outflows, absorption by
reprocessing layers, and Comptonization can cause the observed radiation to
depart from that of a bare disc, possibly giving rise to the observed
optical/UV emission along with soft X-rays from the disc. If, instead, most of
the debris follows highly eccentric orbits for a significant time, many
properties of the observed optical/UV emission can be explained by the scale of
those eccentric orbits and the shocks embedded in the debris flow near orbital
apocenter. In this picture, soft X-ray emission at early times results from the
smaller amount of debris mass deflected into a compact accretion disc by weak
shocks near the stellar pericenter. A general proposal for the near-constancy
of the ultraviolet/optical color temperatures is provided, by linking it to
incomplete thermalization of radiation in the atmosphere of the emitting
region. We also briefly discuss the radio signals from the interaction of
unbound debris and jets with the black hole environment.

mechanisms for driving the formation of planetesimals, may not be as efficient
as previously thought. Under some disc conditions, the growth timescale of the
instability can be longer than the disc lifetime when multiple dust species are
considered. To further explore this finding, we use both linear analysis and
direct numerical simulations with gas fluid and dust particles to mutually
validate and study the unstable modes of the instability in more detail. We
extend the previously studied parameter space by one order of magnitude in both
the range of the dust-size distribution $[T_{s,min}, T_{s,max}]$ and the total
solid-to-gas mass ratio $\varepsilon$ and introduce a third dimension with the
slope $q$ of the size distribution. We find that the fast-growth regime and the
slow-growth regime are distinctly separated in the $\varepsilon$-$T_{s,max}$
space, while this boundary is not appreciably sensitive to $q$ or $T_{s,min}$.
With a wide range of dust sizes present in the disc (e.g.
$T_{s,min}\lesssim10^{-3}$), the growth rate in the slow-growth regime
decreases as more dust species are considered. With a narrow range of dust
sizes (e.g. $T_{s,max}/T_{s,min}=5$), on the other hand, the growth rate in
most of the $\varepsilon$-$T_{s,max}$ space is converged with increasing dust
species, but the fast and the slow growth regimes remain clearly separated.
Moreover, it is not necessary that the largest dust species dominate the growth
of the unstable modes, and the smaller dust species can affect the growth rate
in a complicated way. In any case, we find that the fast-growth regime is
bounded by $\varepsilon\gtrsim 1$ or $T_{s,max}\gtrsim 1$, which may represent
the favourable conditions for planetesimal formation.

cities (e.g., Wuhan, Milan) to little change (e.g., Rio de Janeiro, Taipei). On
average, NO$_{2}$ concentrations were 18% lower than business as usual from

concentrations since April have mostly recovered and remained within 5% to the
business as usual estimate. NO$_{2}$ reductions in Europe and the US have been
more gradual with a halting recovery starting in late March. We estimate that
the global NO$_{x}$ (NO+NO$_{2}$) emission reduction during the first 6 months

flattening of the O$_{3}$ diurnal cycle with an increase in night time ozone
due to reduced titration and a decrease in daytime ozone, reflecting a
reduction in photochemical production. The O$_{3}$ response is dependent on

such that deleting the endpoints of $P'$ results in $P$. An induced path in a
graph is said to be avoidable if each of its extensions is contained in an
induced cycle. In 2019, Beisegel, Chudovsky, Gurvich, Milani\v{c}, and
Servatius conjectured that every graph that contains an induced $k$-vertex path
also contains an avoidable induced path of the same length, and proved the
result for $k = 2$. The case $k = 1$ was known much earlier, due to a work of
Ohtsuki, Cheung, and Fujisawa in 1976. The conjecture was proved for all $k$ in
2020 by Bonamy, Defrain, Hatzel, and Thiebaut. In the present paper, using a
similar approach, we strengthen their result from a reconfiguration point of
view. Namely, we show that in every graph, each induced path can be transformed
to an avoidable one by a sequence of shifts, where two induced $k$-vertex paths

organic-based optoelectronic applications. Charge transport is a crucial aspect
of their performance. The ability to predict accurate electron mobility is
needed in designing novel organic semiconducting materials. In the present
work, the Semi-Classical Marcus (SCM) and Marcus-Levich-Jortner (MLJ) hopping
models are employed to numerically describe the charge mobility in six distinct
birhodanine-like crystals. These materials were recently used in n-channel
organic transistors as electron transporting layers. Results have revealed that
the MLJ approach predicts electron mobilities in good agreement with the
experiment, whereas SCM underestimates this parameter. Remarkably, we found for
one of the birhodanine derivatives studied here average electron mobility of
0.14 cm^2 V^(-1) s^(-1), which agrees with the one reported in experimental
investigations. Moreover, it was identified that the MLJ approach presents a
strong dependency on external reorganization energy. For SCM, a change in the
reorganization energy value has a small impact on mobility, while for MLJ it
impacts the average electron mobility that exponentially decays by increasing
the external reorganization energy. Importantly, we highlight the primary
source of the differences in predicting the electron mobility presented by both
approaches, providing useful details that will help the selection of one of
these two models for study different species of organic molecular crystals.

multiplexing and demultiplexing using $N$ pairs of identical LWAs in each

provide a simple, compact, high-efficiency, and low-profile

does not require matching networks and can be directly scaled to higher

hypothesized in order to explain the existence of Venus's co-orbital dust ring.
We conducted a 5 day twilight survey for these objects with the Cerro-Tololo
Inter-American Observatory (CTIO) 4 meter telescope covering about 35 unique
square degrees to 21 mag in the $r$-band. Our survey provides the most
stringent limit so far on the number of Venus co-orbital asteroids; it was
capable of detecting $5\%$ of the entire population of those asteroids brighter
than 21 magnitude. We estimate an upper limit on the number of co-orbital
asteroids brighter than 21 magnitude (approximately 400-900 m in diameter
depending on the asteroid albedo) to be $N=18^{+30}_{-14}$. Previous studies
estimated the mass of the observed dust ring co-orbiting with Venus to be
equivalent to an asteroid with a 2 km diameter ground to dust. Our survey
estimates $<6$ asteroids larger than 2 km. This implies the following
possibilities: that Venus co-orbitals are non-reflective at the observed phase
angles, have a very low albedo ($<1\%$), or that the Venus co-orbital dust ring
has a source other than asteroids co-orbiting Venus. We discuss this result,
and as an aid to future searches, we provide predictions for the spatial,
visual magnitude, and number density distributions of stable Venus co-orbitals
based on the dynamics of the region and magnitude estimates for various
asteroid types.

conform to the structure of the input format and thus, grammars can be used to
generate syntactically correct inputs. In this context, fuzzing can be guided
by probabilities attached to competing rules in the grammar, leading to the
idea of probabilistic grammar-based fuzzing. However, the optimal assignment of
probabilities to individual grammar rules to effectively expose erroneous
behavior for individual systems under test is an open research question. In
this paper, we present EvoGFuzz, an evolutionary grammar-based fuzzing approach
to optimize the probabilities to generate test inputs that may be more likely
to trigger exceptional behavior. The evaluation shows the effectiveness of
EvoGFuzz in detecting defects compared to probabilistic grammar-based fuzzing
(baseline). Applied to ten real-world applications with common input formats
(JSON, JavaScript, or CSS3), the evaluation shows that EvoGFuzz achieved a
significantly larger median line coverage for all subjects by up to 48%

connecting $i$ and $i+1$ (cyclically) and $\pi(i)$ and $\pi(i+1)$ (cyclically).
If the numbers are i.i.d. samples, then a result of Friedman implies that $G$

i.i.d: compute the second largest (in absolute value) eigenvalue of the

the numbers to be i.i.d. We explain why this is a reasonable test and give many

a model that can perform some form of symbol grounding, mapping high

This paper takes a permutation perspective and argues that action sequencing
benefits from the ability to reason about both permutations and ordering
concepts. Empirical analysis shows that neural models trained with latent

a proper scoring rule with respect to the distribution over

urban traffic scenes is attributed to the unpredictable behavior of
pedestrians, whereby actions and intentions are constantly in flux and depend
on the pedestrians pose, their 3D spatial relations, and their interaction with
other agents as well as with the environment. To partially address these
challenges, we consider the importance of pose toward recognition and 3D
localization of pedestrian actions. In particular, we propose an action
recognition framework using a two-stream temporal relation network with inputs
corresponding to the raw RGB image sequence of the tracked pedestrian as well
as the pedestrian pose. The proposed method outperforms methods using a
single-stream temporal relation network based on evaluations using the JAAD

vertical z(j=i$\pm$1) modes and the longitudinal mode x(i). Discreet
instabilities are observed as the branches of x- and z-modes intersect each
other. The mode spectra in the vicinity of the instabilities exhibit enhanced
energy density at specific coupled x and z modes, serving as direct evidence
that these instabilities are caused by resonance between the coupled modes. The
instability-induced melting threshold was found to obey the Lindemann criterion
through analysis of the instantaneous relative interparticle distance
fluctuation (IDF). The relation between mode spectra and dispersion relations
was further studied by multiplying the mode spectra with a transition matrix
connecting the bases of normal mode eigenvectors and Fourier series in k space.
Typical dispersion relations corresponding to the longitudinal and out-of-plane

  (SSBSE 2020)",,,,"cs.SE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Anyone working in the technology sector is probably familiar with the
question: ""Have you tried turning it off and on again?"", as this is usually the
default question asked by tech support. Similarly, it is known in search based
testing that metaheuristics might get trapped in a plateau during a search. As
a human, one can look at the gradient of the fitness curve and decide to
restart the search, so as to hopefully improve the results of the optimization
with the next run. Trying to automate such a restart, it has to be
programmatically decided whether the metaheuristic has encountered a plateau
yet, which is an inherently difficult problem. To mitigate this problem in the
context of theoretical search problems, the Bet and Run strategy was developed,
where multiple algorithm instances are started concurrently, and after some
time all but the single most promising instance in terms of fitness values are
killed. In this paper, we adopt and evaluate the Bet and Run strategy for the
problem of test case generation. Our work indicates that use of this restart
strategy does not generally lead to gains in the quality metrics, when
instantiated with the best parameters found in the literature.

  reported cases","7 pages, 2 figures",,,"ICAS 051/20","q-bio.PE stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: One of the most challenging keys to understand COVID-19 evolution
is to have a measure on those mild cases which are never tested because their
few symptoms are soft and/or fade away soon. The problem is not only that they
are difficult to identify and test, but also that it is believed that they may
constitute the bulk of the cases and could be crucial in the pandemic equation.
  Methods: We present a novel algorithm to extract the number of these mild
cases by correlating a COVID-line calls to reported cases in given districts.
The key assumption is to realize that, being a highly contagious disease, the
number of calls by mild cases should be proportional to the number of reported
cases. Whereas a background of calls not related to infected people should be
proportional to the district population.
  Results: We find that for Buenos Aires Province, in addition to the
background, there are in signal 6.6 +/- 0.4 calls per each reported COVID-19
case. Using this we estimate in Buenos Aires Province 20 +/- 2 COVID-19
symptomatic cases for each one reported.
  Conclusions: A very simple algorithm that models the COVID-line calls as sum
of signal plus background allows to estimate the crucial number of the rate of
symptomatic to reported COVID-19 cases in a given district. The result from
this method is an early and inexpensive estimate and should be contrasted to
other methods such as serology and/or massive testing.

spin-orbit torques based on the region that they originate in provides clues as
to how to optimize the effect. While most bulk spin-orbit torque contributions
are well studied, many of the interfacial contributions allowed by symmetry
have yet to be fully explored theoretically and experimentally. To facilitate
progress, we review interfacial spin-orbit torques from a semiclassical
viewpoint and relate these contributions to recent experimental results. Within
the same model, we show the relationship between different interface transport
parameters. For charges and spins flowing perpendicular to the interface,
interfacial spin-orbit coupling both modifies the mixing conductance of
magnetoelectronic circuit theory and gives rise to spin memory loss. For
in-plane electric fields, interfacial spin-orbit coupling gives rise to torques
described by spin-orbit filtering, spin swapping and precession. In addition,
these same interfacial processes generate spin currents that flow into the
non-magnetic layer. For in-plane electric fields in trilayer structures, the
spin currents generated at the interface between one ferromagnetic layer and
the non-magnetic spacer layer can propagate through the non-magnetic layer to
produce novel torques on the other ferromagnetic layer.

observation offers a way to utilize unlabeled demonstrations (e.g., video) to
perform imitation learning. One approach to this is behavioral cloning from
observation (BCO). The original implementation of BCO proceeds by first
learning an inverse dynamics model and then using that model to estimate action
labels, thereby reducing the problem to behavioral cloning. However, existing
approaches to BCO require a large number of initial interactions in the first
step. Here, we provide a novel theoretical analysis of BCO, introduce a
modification BCO*, and show that in the semi-supervised setting, BCO* can
concurrently improve both its estimate for the inverse dynamics model and the
expert policy. This result allows us to eliminate the dependence on initial
interactions and dramatically improve the sample complexity of BCO. We evaluate
the effectiveness of our algorithm through experiments on various benchmark
domains. The results demonstrate that concurrent training not only improves
over the performance of BCO but also results in performance that is competitive

group $N_k$ whose Dehn function behaves like $n^k$, while the Dehn function of
its associated Carnot graded group $\mathsf{gr}(N_k)$ behaves like $n^{k+1}$.
This property and its consequences allow us to reveal three new phenomena.
First, since those groups have uniform lattices, this provides the first
examples of pairs of finitely presented groups with bilipschitz asymptotic
cones but with different Dehn functions. The second surprising feature of these
groups is that for every even integer $k \geqslant 4$ the centralized Dehn
function of $N_k$ behaves like $n^{k-1}$ and so has a different exponent than
the Dehn function. This answers a question of Young. Finally, we turn our
attention to sublinear bilipschitz equivalences (SBE). Introduced by Cornulier,
these are maps between metric spaces inducing bi-Lipschitz homeomorphisms
between their asymptotic cones. These can be seen as weakenings of
quasiisometries where the additive error is replaced by a sublinearly growing
function $v$. We show that a $v$-SBE between $N_k$ and $\mathsf{gr}(N_k)$ must
satisfy $v(n)\succcurlyeq n^{1/(2k + 1)}$, strengthening the fact that those
two groups are not quasiisometric. This is the first instance where an explicit
lower bound is provided for a pair of SBE groups.

$m$, $m$-coherence is the number of examples in the sample that benefit from a

compared to other commonly used metrics, $m$-coherence is more interpretable,
cheaper to compute ($O(m)$ instead of $O(m^2)$) and mathematically cleaner. (We
note that $m$-coherence is closely connected to gradient diversity, a quantity
previously used in some theoretical bounds.) Using $m$-coherence, we study the
evolution of alignment of per-example gradients in ResNet and Inception models
on ImageNet and several variants with label noise, particularly from the
perspective of the recently proposed Coherent Gradients (CG) theory that
provides a simple, unified explanation for memorization and generalization
[Chatterjee, ICLR 20]. Although we have several interesting takeaways, our most
surprising result concerns memorization. Naively, one might expect that when
training with completely random labels, each example is fitted independently,
and so $m$-coherence should be close to 1. However, this is not the case:
$m$-coherence reaches much higher values during training (100s), indicating
that over-parameterized neural networks find common patterns even in scenarios
where generalization is not possible. A detailed analysis of this phenomenon
provides both a deeper confirmation of CG, but at the same point puts into
sharp relief what is missing from the theory in order to provide a complete
explanation of generalization in neural networks.

extended to take the uncertainties of wind generation and load demand into

Information at the Transmitter (CSIT). In this paper, we focus on an overloaded
Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC) with two groups of
CSIT qualities, namely one group of users (representative of high-end devices)
for which the transmitter has partial knowledge of the CSI, the other group of
users (representative of IoT devices) for which the transmitter only has
knowledge of the statistical CSI. We introduce Rate-Splitting Multiple Access
(RSMA), a new multiple access based on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) for
cellular IoT. Two strategies are proposed, namely, Time Partitioning-RSMA
(TP-RSMA) and Power Partitioning-RSMA (PP-RSMA). The former independently
serves the two groups of users over orthogonal time slots while the latter
jointly serves the two groups of users within the same time slot in a
non-orthogonal manner. We first show at high Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) that
PP-RSMA achieves the optimum Degrees-of-Freedom (DoF) in an overloaded MISO BC
with heterogeneous CSIT qualities and then show at finite SNR that, by marrying
the benefits of PP and RSMA, PP-RSMA achieves explicit sum rate gain over
TP-RSMA and all baseline schemes. Furthermore, PP-RSMA is robust to CSIT
inaccuracy and flexible to cope with Quality of Service (QoS) rate constraints
of all users. The DoF and rate analysis helps us draw the conclusion that
PP-RSMA is a powerful framework for cellular IoT with a large number of

resulting posterior is harder to analyze theoretically. We consider a
``projection-posterior'' approach, where a conjugate normal prior is used, but
the monotonicity constraint is imposed on posterior samples by a projection map

contracts at the optimal rate $n^{-1/3}$ under the $L_1$-metric and at a nearly
optimal rate under the empirical $L_p$-metrics for $0<p\le 2$. The
projection-posterior approach is also computationally more convenient. We also

  Collaborative Filtering","10 pages, 7 figures",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One-class collaborative filtering (OC-CF) is a common class of recommendation
problem where only the positive class is explicitly observed (e.g., purchases,
clicks). Autoencoder based recommenders such as AutoRec and variants
demonstrate strong performance on many OC-CF benchmarks, but also empirically
suffer from a strong popularity bias. While a careful choice of negative
samples in the OC-CF setting can mitigate popularity bias, Negative Sampling
(NS) is often better for training embeddings than for the end task itself. To
address this, we propose a two-headed AutoRec to first train an embedding layer
via one head using Negative Sampling then to train for the final task via the
second head. While this NS-AutoRec improves results for AutoRec and outperforms
many state-of-the-art baselines on OC-CF problems, we notice that Negative
Sampling can still take a large amount of time to train. Since Negative
Sampling is known to be a special case of Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE),
we adapt a recently proposed closed-form NCE solution for collaborative
filtering to AutoRec yielding NCE-AutoRec. Overall, we show that our novel
two-headed AutoRec models (NCE-AutoRec and NS-AutoRec) successfully mitigate
the popularity bias issue and maintain competitive performance in comparison to
state-of-the-art recommenders on multiple real-world datasets.

Mg II and Ca II, the self-reversed cores of which form in the upper
chromosphere. Based on 3D simulations as well as data for the Mg II lines from
IRIS, we argue that the resolution lies not in velocity fields on scales in
either of the micro- or macro-turbulent limits. Macro-turbulence is ruled out
using observations of optically thin lines formed in the upper chromosphere,
and by showing that it would need to have unreasonably special properties to
account for critical observations of the Mg II resonance lines from the IRIS
mission. The power in turbulence in the upper chromosphere may therefore be
substantially lower than earlier analyses have inferred. Instead, in 3D
calculations horizontal radiative transfer produces smoother source functions,
smoothing out intensity gradients in wavelength and in space. These effects
increase in stronger lines. Our work will have consequences for understanding
the onset of the transition region, the energy in motions available for heating
the corona, and for the interpretation of polarization data in terms of the
Hanle effect applied to resonance line profiles.

while smart-tracing technology raises people's privacy concerns. In this paper,
we propose a solution for the life-or-economy dilemma that does not require
private data. We bypass the private-data requirement by suppressing epidemic
transmission through a dynamic control on inter-regional mobility that only
relies on Origin-Designation (OD) data. We develop DUal-objective
Reinforcement-Learning Epidemic Control Agent (DURLECA) to search
mobility-control policies that can simultaneously minimize infection spread and
maximally retain mobility. DURLECA hires a novel graph neural network, namely
Flow-GNN, to estimate the virus-transmission risk induced by urban mobility.
The estimated risk is used to support a reinforcement learning agent to
generate mobility-control actions. The training of DURLECA is guided with a
well-constructed reward function, which captures the natural trade-off relation
between epidemic control and mobility retaining. Besides, we design two
exploration strategies to improve the agent's searching efficiency and help it
get rid of local optimums. Extensive experimental results on a real-world OD
dataset show that DURLECA is able to suppress infections at an extremely low
level while retaining 76\% of the mobility in the city. Our implementation is
available at https://github.com/anyleopeace/DURLECA/.

production of heavy elements in the earliest phase of structure formation.
Their mass scale can be derived from the elemental abundance pattern of
extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars, which are assumed to inherit the abundances
of uniformly mixed supernova (SN) ejecta. If the expanding ejecta maintains its
initial stratified structure, the elemental abundance pattern of EMP stars
might be different from that from uniform ejecta. In this work we perform
numerical simulations of the metal enrichment from stratified ejecta for normal
core-collapse SNe (CCSNe) with a progenitor mass $25 \ {\rm M}_{\bigodot}$ and
explosion energies 0.7--10 B ($1 \ {\rm B} = 10^{51}$ erg). We find that SN
shells fall back into the central minihalo in all models. In the recollapsing
clouds, the abundance ratio ${\rm [M/Fe]}$ for stratified ejecta is different
from the one for uniform ejecta only within $\pm 0.4$ dex for any element M. We
also find that, for the largest explosion energy (10 B), a neighboring halo is
also enriched. Only the outer layers containing Ca or lighter elements reach
the halo, where ${\rm [C/Fe]} = 1.49$. This means that C-enhanced metal-poor
(CEMP) stars can form from the CCSN even with an average abundance ratio ${\rm

most fundamental elements are the concept of a macrostate in relation to the
large-deviation entropy, and the decomposition of contributions to
irreversibility among interacting subsystems, which is the origin of the
dependence on a concept of heat in both classical and stochastic
thermodynamics. A natural decomposition is shown to exist, into a relative
entropy and a housekeeping entropy rate, which define respectively the
\textit{intensive} thermodynamics of a system and an \textit{extensive}
thermodynamic vector embedding the system in its context. Both intensive and
extensive components are functions of Hartley information of the momentary
system stationary state, which is information \emph{about} the joint effect of
system processes on its contribution to irreversibility. Results are derived
for stochastic Chemical Reaction Networks, including a Legendre duality for the

transients (glitches) is a very challenging task. For a given data set,
transient gravitational wave searches produce a corresponding list of triggers
that indicate the possible presence of a gravitational wave signal. These
triggers are often the result of glitches mimicking gravitational wave signal
characteristics. To distinguish glitches from genuine gravitational wave
signals, search algorithms estimate a range of trigger attributes, with
thresholds applied to these trigger properties to separate signal from noise.
Here, we present the use of Gaussian mixture models, a supervised machine
learning approach, as a means of modelling the multi-dimensional trigger
attribute space. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to triggers from
the coherent Waveburst search for generic bursts in LIGO O1 data. By building
Gaussian mixture models for the signal and background noise attribute spaces,
we show that we can significantly improve the sensitivity of the coherent

particular, we focus on the process of non-perturbative high-order harmonic
generation from the paradigmatic three-dimensional topological insulator
bismuth selenide (Bi$_2$Se$_3$) subjected to intense mid-infrared laser fields.
We analyze the contributions from the spin-orbit-coupled bulk states and the
topological surface bands separately and reveal a major difference in how their
harmonic yields depend on the ellipticity of the laser field. Bulk harmonics
show a monotonous decrease in their yield as the ellipticity increases, in a
manner reminiscent of high harmonic generation in gaseous media. However, the
surface contribution exhibits a highly non-trivial dependence, culminating with
a maximum for circularly polarized fields. We attribute the observed anomalous
behaviour to: (i) the enhanced amplitude and the circular pattern of the
interband dipole and the Berry connections in the vicinity of the Dirac point;
and (ii) the influence of the higher-order, ""hexagonal warping"" terms in the
Hamiltonian, which are responsible for the hexagonal deformation of the energy
surface at higher momenta. The latter are associated directly with
spin-orbit-coupling parameters. Our results thus establish the sensitivity of
strong-field driven high harmonic emission to the topology of the band

Modeling the locations of MBSs by a homogeneous 2D Poisson point process (PPP),
we first characterize the total chord length distribution of the lines of the
Poisson line process (PLP) intersecting the typical Poisson Voronoi (PV) cell.
Using this result, we derive the exact probability mass function (PMF) of the
load on the typical MBS. Considering the computational complexity of this
expression, we propose an easy-to-use approximation for the PMF that is also
remarkably accurate. Building on this result, we also compute the PMF of the
load on the tagged MBS that serves the typical vehicular user. This result
enables the characterization of the rate coverage of the typical receiver in
the network, which is also included as a useful case study.

correspondence with all features of test image under conditional random field

The experiments verify that DFNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a
large margin with a mean IoU score of 83.4% and ranks first on the DAVIS-2016
leaderboard while using much fewer parameters and achieving much more efficient
performance in the inference phase. We further evaluate DFNet on the FBMS
dataset and the video saliency dataset ViSal, reaching a new state-of-the-art.
To further demonstrate the generalizability of our framework, DFNet is also
applied to the image object co-segmentation task. We perform experiments on a
challenging dataset PASCAL-VOC and observe the superiority of DFNet. The
thorough experiments verify that DFNet is able to capture and mine the
underlying relations of images and discover the common foreground objects.

others using many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) and the diagrammatic theory
for non-equilibrium processes. Much of the literature is based on the original
MBPT-based approach and this makes it inaccessible to those unfamiliar with
advanced quantum statistical mechanics. We obtain the NEGF equations directly
from a one-electron Schr\""odinger equation using relatively elementary
arguments. These equations have been used to discuss many problems of great
interest such as quantized conductance, (integer) quantum Hall effect, Anderson
localization, resonant tunneling and spin transport without a systematic
treatment of many-body effects. But it goes beyond purely coherent transport
allowing us to include phase-breaking interactions (both momentum-relaxing and
momentum-conserving as well as spin-conserving and spin-relaxing) within a
self-consistent Born approximation. We believe that the scope and utility of
the NEGF equations transcend the MBPT-based approach originally used to derive
it. NEGF teaches us how to combine quantum dynamics with ""contacts"" much as
Boltzmann taught us how to combine classical dynamics with ""contacts"", using
the word contacts in a broad, figurative sense to denote all kinds of
entropy-driven processes. We believe that this approach to ""contact-ing"" the

shared the same projected morphology with the intruding filaments and were
accompanied by intermittent footpoint brightenings. Simultaneous spectral

reconnection related heating and bidirectional flows near the jet bases and
contribute to measuring vector velocities of the jets. Additionally, nonlinear

propose that the jets could be caused by magnetic reconnections between

mean of integrated-intensity ratio of $^{12}$CO to $^{13}$CO lines ($R_{1213}$)

(1) $R_{1213}$ positively correlates to specific star-formation rate (sSFR)

scenario where $R_{1213}$ variation is mainly caused by the changes in
molecular-gas properties such as temperature and turbulence. The consequent
variation of CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor across the SF main sequence is not
large enough to completely extinguish the known correlations between sSFR and
$M_{\rm mol}/M_{\rm star}$ ($\mu_{\rm mol}$) or star-formation efficiency (SFE)

Jupiter WASP-19b with Teq ~ 2700 K. At these high temperatures we find that H2O
dissociates thermally at pressure below 10^-2 bar. The inverted

is due to the strong impinging radiation. We show that H2O is partially
dissociated in the upper atmosphere above about tau = 10^-2, but is still a
significant contributor to the infrared-opacity, dominated by CO. The
high-temperature and low-density conditions cause H2O to have a flatter opacity

Then, we develop an iterative algorithm to update the solution along with the
regularization (penalty) coefficient. We show that our update procedure
guarantees the convergence of the algorithm. Moreover, assuming the objective
function is continuously differentiable, we derive the convergence rate, a
lower bound on the value of regularization coefficient, and an upper bound on
the number of iterations required for the convergence. We use a radio access

rich visual representations applicable to 3D object tracking in complex dynamic
scenes. We are motivated in this pursuit by the fact that the physical world
itself is mostly static, and multiview correspondence labels are relatively
cheap to collect in static scenes, e.g., by triangulation. We propose to
leverage multiview data of \textit{static points} in arbitrary scenes (static
or dynamic), to learn a neural 3D mapping module which produces features that
are correspondable across time. The neural 3D mapper consumes RGB-D data as
input, and produces a 3D voxel grid of deep features as output. We train the
voxel features to be correspondable across viewpoints, using a contrastive
loss, and correspondability across time emerges automatically. At test time,
given an RGB-D video with approximate camera poses, and given the 3D box of an
object to track, we track the target object by generating a map of each
timestep and locating the object's features within each map. In contrast to
models that represent video streams in 2D or 2.5D, our model's 3D scene
representation is disentangled from projection artifacts, is stable under
camera motion, and is robust to partial occlusions. We test the proposed
architectures in challenging simulated and real data, and show that our
unsupervised 3D object trackers outperform prior unsupervised 2D and 2.5D
trackers, and approach the accuracy of supervised trackers. This work
demonstrates that 3D object trackers can emerge without tracking labels,
through multiview self-supervision on static data.

Moreover, we prove that the SPIDER-ADMM achieves a record-breaking incremental
first-order oracle (IFO) complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n+n^{1/2}\epsilon^{-1})$
for finding an $\epsilon$-approximate stationary point, which improves the
deterministic ADMM by a factor $\mathcal{O}(n^{1/2})$, where $n$ denotes the
sample size. As one of major contribution of this paper, we provide a new
theoretical analysis framework for nonconvex stochastic ADMM methods with
providing the optimal IFO complexity. Based on this new analysis framework, we
study the unsolved optimal IFO complexity of the existing non-convex SVRG-ADMM

$\mathcal{O}(n+n^{2/3}\epsilon^{-1})$. Thus, the SPIDER-ADMM improves the

discover a self-hybridization effect where pairs of either optical or acoustic

Observatory (aLIGO), joined by the Advanced Virgo detector, began the third
observing run, a year-long dedicated search for gravitational radiation. The
LIGO detectors have achieved a higher duty cycle and greater sensitivity to
gravitational waves than ever before, with LIGO Hanford achieving
angle-averaged sensitivity to binary neutron star coalescences to a distance of
111 Mpc, and LIGO Livingston to 134 Mpc with duty factors of 74.6% and 77.0%
respectively. The improvement in sensitivity and stability is a result of
several upgrades to the detectors, including doubled intracavity power, the
addition of an in-vacuum optical parametric oscillator for squeezed-light
injection, replacement of core optics and end reaction masses, and installation
of acoustic mode dampers. This paper explores the purposes behind these
upgrades, and explains to the best of our knowledge the noise currently
limiting the sensitivity of each detector.

reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced. As an extension, the
implementations of the above mentioned DRL methods are established
mathematically. Then, the freeway driving scenario for the automated vehicles
is constructed, wherein the decision-making problem is transferred as a control
optimization problem. Finally, a series of simulation experiments are achieved
to evaluate the control performance of these DRL-enabled decision-making
strategies. A comparative analysis is realized to connect the autonomous
driving results with the learning characteristics of these DRL techniques.

constraining the acceleration efficiency of ions. Here, we model the broadest

by the one-zone leptonic model in which the electrons/positrons produce the
emission from radio to soft $\gamma$-rays via the synchrotron process, and
simultaneously generate the GeV-TeV $\gamma$-rays through inverse Compton
scattering including the synchrotron self-Compton process. In the framework of
this leptonic model, the fraction of energy converted into the energetic
protons is constrained to be below $0.5\ (n_{\rm t}/10\ {\rm cm}^{-3})^{-1}$
per cent, where $n_{\rm t}$ is the target gas density in the Crab. However,
this fraction can be up to $7\ (n_{\rm t}/10\ {\rm cm}^{-3})^{-1}$ per cent if

probability distributions for stochastic processes in large-system limits. The
trajectories are solutions to equations of motion of Hamiltonian dynamical
systems, and are known as eikonals. They also express the leading flow lines
along which probability currents balance. The existing eikonal methods for
discrete-state processes including chemical reaction networks are based on the
Liouville operator that evolves generating functions of the underlying
probability distribution. We have previously derived a representation for the
generators of such processes that acts directly in the hierarchy of moments of
the distribution, rather than on the distribution itself or on its generating
function. We show here how in the large-system limit the steady-state condition
for that generator reduces to a mapping from eikonals to the ratios of
neighboring factorial moments, as a function of the order $k$ of these moments.
The construction shows that the boundary values for the moment hierarchy, and
thus its whole solution, are anchored in the interior fixed points of the
Hamiltonian system, a result familiar from Freidlin-Wenztell theory. The direct
derivation of eikonals from the moment representation further illustrates the
relation between coherent-state and number fields in Doi-Peliti theory,
clarifying the role of canonical transformations in that theory.

Fourier spectrum, one can construct a PRG with a seed length whose quality
scales with $k$. This interpolates previous works, which either require Fourier
bounds on all levels [CHHL19], or have polynomial dependence on the error
parameter in the seed length [CHLT10], and thus answers an open question in
[CHLT19]. As an example, we show that for polynomial error, Fourier bounds on
the first $O(\log n)$ levels is sufficient to recover the seed length in
[CHHL19], which requires bounds on the entire tail.
  We obtain our results by an alternate analysis of fractional PRGs using
Taylor's theorem and bounding the degree-$k$ Lagrange remainder term using
multilinearity and random restrictions. Interestingly, our analysis relies only
on the \emph{level-k unsigned Fourier sum}, which is potentially a much smaller
quantity than the $L_1$ notion in previous works. By generalizing a connection
established in [CHH+20], we give a new reduction from constructing PRGs to
proving correlation bounds. Finally, using these improvements we show how to
obtain a PRG for $\mathbb{F}_2$ polynomials with seed length close to the
state-of-the-art construction due to Viola [Vio09], which was not known to be

multi-robot team subject to resource failures. Each robot in the team is
equipped with resources that it shares with its neighbors. Additionally, each
robot in the team executes a task, whose performance depends on the resources
to which it has access. When a resource on a particular robot becomes
unavailable (\eg a camera ceases to function), the team optimally reconfigures
its communication network so that the robots affected by the failure can
continue their tasks. We focus on a monitoring task, where robots individually
estimate the state of an exogenous process. We encode the end-to-end effect of
a robot's resource loss on the monitoring performance of the team by defining a
new stronger notion of observability -- \textit{one-hop observability}. By
abstracting the impact that {low-level} individual resources have on the task
performance through the notion of one-hop observability, our framework leads to
the principled reconfiguration of information flow in the team to effectively
replace the lost resource on one robot with information from another, as long
as certain conditions are met. Network reconfiguration is converted to the
problem of selecting edges to be modified in the system's communication graph
after a resource failure has occurred. A controller based on finite-time
convergence control barrier functions drives each robot to a spatial location
that enables the communication links of the modified graph. We validate the

ion-selective nanopores, as the Debye length is on the order of 1 - 10 nm for

demonstrate that surface conductance generates a dynamical selectivity in ion
transport, and this selectivity is controlled by so-called Dukhin, rather than
Debye, overlap. The Dukhin length, defined as the ratio of surface to bulk
conductance, reaches values of hundreds of nanometers for typical surface
charge densities and ionic concentrations, suggesting the possibility of

Illustrations and interactive visualizations help both students and
professionals to comprehend mathematical material and to work with it. This
approach lends itself particularly well to geometrical objects. An example for
this category of mathematical objects are hyperbolic geometric spaces. When
Euclid lay down the foundations of mathematics, his formulation of geometry
reflected the surrounding space, as humans perceive it. For about two
millennia, it remained unclear whether there are alternative geometric spaces
that carry their own, unique mathematical properties and that do not reflect
human every-day perceptions. Finally, in the early 19th century, several
mathematicians described such geometries, which do not follow Euclid's rules
and which were at first interesting solely from a pure mathematical point of
view. These descriptions were not very accessible as mathematicians approached
the geometries via complicated collections of formulae. Within the following
decades, visualization aided the new concepts and two-dimensional versions of
these illustrations even appeared in artistic works. Furthermore, certain
aspects of Einstein's theory of relativity provided applications for
non-Euclidean geometric spaces. With the rise of computer graphics towards the
end of the twentieth century, three-dimensional illustrations became available
to explore these geometries and their non-intuitive properties. However, just
as the canvas confines the two-dimensional depictions, the computer monitor
confines these three-dimensional visualizations. Only virtual reality recently
made it possible to present immersive experiences of non-Euclidean geometries.
In virtual reality, users have completely new opportunities to encounter
geometric properties and effects that are not present in their surrounding
Euclidean world.

well-defined irradiated interfaces known in a region of massive star formation.
The new narrowband H$_2$ 2.12$\mu$m, Br-$\gamma$ and K-continuum images trace
the photoevaporative flow from the cloud and identify locations where
UV-radiation from the surrounding massive stars excites molecular hydrogen to
fluoresce. With a field of view of $\sim$ 1.5' $\times$ 2.9' and spatial
resolution between 60 $-$ 110 mas, the new images show a spectacular level of
detail over a large area, and presage what JWST should achieve. The Wall is
convex in shape, with a large triangular-shaped extension near its apex. The
interface near the apex consists of 3 $-$ 4 regularly-spaced ridges with
projected spacings of $\sim$ 2000 AU, suggestive of a large-scale
dynamically-important magnetic field. The northern edge of the Wall breaks into
several swept-back fragments of width $\sim$ 1800 AU that resemble
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, and the southern part of the Wall also shows
complex morphologies including a sinusoidal-like variation with a
half-wavelength of 2500 AU. Though the dissociation front must increase the
density along the surface of the Wall, it does not resolve into pillars that
point back to the ionization sources, as could occur if the front triggered new
stars to form. We discovered that MHO 1630, an H$_2$ outflow with no clear
driving source in the northern portion of the Wall, consists of a series of bow
shocks arrayed in a line.

radio modes and operating parameters. Due to the non-convex and combinatorial
structure, we develop a novel optimization-driven hierarchical deep
deterministic policy gradient (H-DDPG) approach to adapt the beamforming and
relay strategies dynamically. The optimization-driven H-DDPG algorithm firstly
decomposes the binary relay mode selection into the outer-loop deep Q-network
(DQN) algorithm and then optimizes the continuous beamforming and relaying
parameters by using the inner-loop DDPG algorithm. Secondly, to improve the
learning efficiency, we integrate the model-based optimization into the DDPG
framework by providing a better-informed target estimation for DNN training.
Simulation results reveal that these two special designs ensure a more stable

nanometers have been the subject of intense study over the last two decades.
Recently, it has been shown that the efficiency of such thermal engines can be
enhanced by using active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUP). In this work, we
numerically study the behaviour of tiny engines and refrigerators that use an
active run-and-tumble particle (RTP) as the working system. We find that the
results for the engine mode are in sharp contrast with those of engines using
AOUP, thus showing that the nature of activity has a strong influence on the
qualitative behaviours of thermal machines for nonequilibrium cycles. The
efficiency of an engine using a run-and-tumble particle is found to be smaller
in general than a passive microscopic engine. However, when the applied
protocol is time-reversed, the resulting microscopic refrigerator can have a
much higher coefficient of performance under these conditions. The effect of
variation of different parameters of the coefficient of performance has been
explored. A non-monotonic variation of coefficient of performance with active
force has been found.

could suffer from intolerably slow query speed and highly redundant storage
cost, due to high-dimensional real-valued embeddings which aim to distinguish
subtle visual differences of fine-grained objects. In this paper, we study the
novel fine-grained hashing topic to generate compact binary codes for
fine-grained images, leveraging the search and storage efficiency of hash
learning to alleviate the aforementioned problems. Specifically, we propose a
unified end-to-end trainable network, termed as ExchNet. Based on attention
mechanisms and proposed attention constraints, it can firstly obtain both local
and global features to represent object parts and whole fine-grained objects,
respectively. Furthermore, to ensure the discriminative ability and semantic
meaning's consistency of these part-level features across images, we design a
local feature alignment approach by performing a feature exchanging operation.
Later, an alternative learning algorithm is employed to optimize the whole
ExchNet and then generate the final binary hash codes. Validated by extensive
experiments, our proposal consistently outperforms state-of-the-art generic
hashing methods on five fine-grained datasets, which shows our effectiveness.
Moreover, compared with other approximate nearest neighbor methods, ExchNet
achieves the best speed-up and storage reduction, revealing its efficiency and
practicality.

Fragility index for a soft-colloid is obtained from the density dependence of

key requirement for both linguistic research and subsequent automated natural
language processing (NLP) tasks. This problem is commonly tackled using machine
learning methods, i.e., by training a POS tagger on a sufficiently large corpus
of labeled data. While the problem of POS tagging can essentially be considered
as solved for modern languages, historical corpora turn out to be much more
difficult, especially due to the lack of native speakers and sparsity of
training data. Moreover, most texts have no sentences as we know them today,
nor a common orthography. These irregularities render the task of automated POS
tagging more difficult and error-prone. Under these circumstances, instead of
forcing the POS tagger to predict and commit to a single tag, it should be
enabled to express its uncertainty. In this paper, we consider POS tagging
within the framework of set-valued prediction, which allows the POS tagger to
express its uncertainty via predicting a set of candidate POS tags instead of
guessing a single one. The goal is to guarantee a high confidence that the
correct POS tag is included while keeping the number of candidates small. In
our experimental study, we find that extending state-of-the-art POS taggers to
set-valued prediction yields more precise and robust taggings, especially for

groups in the group catalog, as well as the alignment relative to the
corresponding subhalos in the ELUCID simulation. Galaxies in observation are
matched to dark matter subhalos in the ELUCID simulation using a novel
neighborhood abundance matching method. In observation, the major axes of
galaxies are found to be preferentially aligned to the major axes of their host
groups. There is a color dependence of galaxy-group alignment that red centrals
have a stronger alignment along the major axes of their host groups than blue
centrals. Combining galaxies in observation and subhalos in the ELUCID
simulation, we also find that central galaxies have their major axes to be
aligned to the major axes of their corresponding subhalos in the ELUCID

are stronger for galaxies in more massive halos. We find that the alignments
between main subhalos and the SDSS matched subhalo systems in simulation are
slightly stronger than the galaxy-group alignments in observation.

which has been explored in different languages. Recently researchers started
paying attention towards machine translation for resource-poor languages and
closely related languages. A widespread and underlying problem for these
machine translation systems is the variation in orthographic conventions which
causes many issues to traditional approaches. Two languages written in two
different orthographies are not easily comparable, but orthographic information
can also be used to improve the machine translation system. This article offers
a survey of research regarding orthography's influence on machine translation
of under-resourced languages. It introduces under-resourced languages in terms
of machine translation and how orthographic information can be utilised to
improve machine translation. We describe previous work in this area, discussing
what underlying assumptions were made, and showing how orthographic knowledge
improves the performance of machine translation of under-resourced languages.
We discuss different types of machine translation and demonstrate a recent
trend that seeks to link orthographic information with well-established machine
translation methods. Considerable attention is given to current efforts of
cognates information at different levels of machine translation and the lessons
that can be drawn from this. Additionally, multilingual neural machine
translation of closely related languages is given a particular focus in this

relying on visual cues. To tackle this task, we propose hybrid models, with

rearranging sequences of small waveform windows. In order to control the
synthesis, all grains in a given corpus are analyzed through a set of acoustic
descriptors. This provides a representation reflecting some form of local
similarities across the grains. However, the quality of this grain space is
bound by that of the descriptors. Its traversal is not continuously invertible
to signal and does not render any structured temporality.
  We demonstrate that generative neural networks can implement granular
synthesis while alleviating most of its shortcomings. We efficiently replace
its audio descriptor basis by a probabilistic latent space learned with a
Variational Auto-Encoder. In this setting the learned grain space is
invertible, meaning that we can continuously synthesize sound when traversing
its dimensions. It also implies that original grains are not stored for
synthesis. Another major advantage of our approach is to learn structured paths
inside this latent space by training a higher-level temporal embedding over
arranged grain sequences.
  The model can be applied to many types of libraries, including pitched notes

rest of cubic graphs falls into two classes: those that can be covered with
four perfect matchings, and those that need at least five. Cubic graphs that
require more than four perfect matchings to cover their edges are particularly

such a phonon-induced CDW (both uni- and bi-axial) reconstructs the Fermi

oscillation frequencies in close consistency with the experiments. Furthermore,
a systematic analysis of the symmetry of the intra-unit-cell charge modulations

Graph Attention Network (CSMGAN) that recasts this task as a process of
iterative messages passing over a joint graph. Specifically, the joint graph
consists of Cross-Modal interaction Graph (CMG) and Self-Modal relation Graph

between cross- and self-modal node pairs are described by an attention

Nevertheless, in recent years, the question whether these properties are really

previously thought, has emerged. New experimental and theoretical observations
have questioned the origin of the boson peak and the linear in T specific heat
exclusively from disorder and TLS. The same properties have been indeed
observed in ordered or minimally disordered compounds and in incommensurate
structures for which the standard explanations are not applicable. Using the
formal analogy between phason modes (e.g. in quasicrystals and incommensurate
lattices) and diffusons, and between amplitude modes and optical phonons, we
suggest the existence of a more universal physics behind these properties. In
particular, we strengthen the idea that linear in T specific heat is linked to
low energy diffusive modes and that a BP excess can be simply induced by gapped
optical-like modes.

(CIL) usually suffers from the ""catastrophic forgetting"" problem when updating
the joint classification model on the arrival of newly added classes. To cope
with the forgetting problem, many CIL methods transfer the knowledge of old
classes by preserving some exemplar samples into the size-constrained memory
buffer. To utilize the memory buffer more efficiently, we propose to keep more
auxiliary low-fidelity exemplar samples rather than the original real
high-fidelity exemplar samples. Such a memory-efficient exemplar preserving
scheme makes the old-class knowledge transfer more effective. However, the
low-fidelity exemplar samples are often distributed in a different domain away
from that of the original exemplar samples, that is, a domain shift. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a duplet learning scheme that seeks to
construct domain-compatible feature extractors and classifiers, which greatly
narrows down the above domain gap. As a result, these low-fidelity auxiliary
exemplar samples have the ability to moderately replace the original exemplar
samples with a lower memory cost. In addition, we present a robust classifier
adaptation scheme, which further refines the biased classifier (learned with
the samples containing distillation label knowledge about old classes) with the
help of the samples of pure true class labels. Experimental results demonstrate
the effectiveness of this work against the state-of-the-art approaches.

impressive ability to represent hyperspectral images (HSIs) and achieved
encouraging results in HSI classification. However, the existing CNN-based
models operate at the patch-level, in which pixel is separately classified into
classes using a patch of images around it. This patch-level classification will
lead to a large number of repeated calculations, and it is difficult to
determine the appropriate patch size that is beneficial to classification
accuracy. In addition, the conventional CNN models operate convolutions with
local receptive fields, which cause failures in modeling contextual spatial
information. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels fully convolutional spatial propagation network
(FCSPN) for HSI classification. Our FCSPN consists of a 3D fully convolution
network (3D-FCN) and a convolutional spatial propagation network (CSPN).
Specifically, the 3D-FCN is firstly introduced for reliable preliminary
classification, in which a novel dual separable residual (DSR) unit is proposed
to effectively capture spectral and spatial information simultaneously with
fewer parameters. Moreover, the channel-wise attention mechanism is adapted in
the 3D-FCN to grasp the most informative channels from redundant channel
information. Finally, the CSPN is introduced to capture the spatial
correlations of HSI via learning a local linear spatial propagation, which
allows maintaining the HSI spatial consistency and further refining the
classification results. Experimental results on three HSI benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed FCSPN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
HSI classification.

complete posets (dcpos). Here we further consider algebraic and continuous
dcpos, and construct Scott's $D_\infty$ model of the untyped
$\lambda$-calculus. A common approach to deal with size issues in a predicative
foundation is to work with information systems or abstract bases or formal
topologies rather than dcpos, and approximable relations rather than Scott
continuous functions. Here we instead accept that dcpos may be large and work
with type universes to account for this. For instance, in the Scott model of
PCF, the dcpos have carriers in the second universe $\mathcal{U}_1$ and suprema
of directed families with indexing type in the first universe $\mathcal{U}_0$.
Seeing a poset as a category in the usual way, we can say that these dcpos are
large, but locally small, and have small filtered colimits. In the case of
algebraic dcpos, in order to deal with size issues, we proceed mimicking the
definition of accessible category. With such a definition, our construction of
Scott's $D_\infty$ again gives a large, locally small, algebraic dcpo with
small directed suprema.

optical correction or imperfect image reproduction is a common source of visual
discomfort, usually attributed to an anomalous and annoying distribution of the
image spectrum in the spatial frequency domain. In the present paper, this
discomfort is attributed to a loss of the localization accuracy of the observed
patterns. It is assumed, as a starting perceptual principle, that the visual
system is optimally adapted to pattern localization in a natural environment.
Thus, since the best possible accuracy of the image patterns localization is
indicated by the positional Fisher Information, it is argued that the blur
discomfort is strictly related to a loss of this information. Following this
concept, a receptive field functional model, tuned to common features of
natural scenes, is adopted to predict the visual discomfort. It is a
complex-valued operator, orientation-selective both in the space domain and in
the spatial frequency domain. Starting from the case of Gaussian blur, the
analysis is extended to a generic type of blur by applying a positional Fisher
Information equivalence criterion. Out-of-focus blur and astigmatic blur are
presented as significant examples. The validity of the proposed model is
verified by comparing its predictions with subjective ratings. The model fits
linearly with the experiments reported in independent databases, based on
different protocols and settings.

results in the context of liver infections which is modeled. Non-local effects
in the dynamics between the virus and the immune system cells coming from the
immune response in the lymphs lead to an integro-partial differential equation.
While existence theorems for parabolic partial differential equations are
textbook examples in the field, the additional integral term requires new
approaches to proving the global existence of a solution. This allows to set up
an existence proof with a focus on interpretation leading to more insight in
the system and in the modeling perspective at the same time.
  We show the boundedness of the solution in the $L^1(\Omega)$- and the
$L^2(\Omega)$-norms, and use these results to prove the global existence and
boundedness of the solution. A core element of the proof is the handling of
oppositely acting mechanisms in the reaction term, which occur in all
population dynamics models and which results in reaction terms with opposite
monotonicity behavior. In the context of modeling liver infections, the
boundedness in the $L^\infty(\Omega)$-norm has practical relevance: Large
immune responses lead to strong inflammations of the liver tissue. Strong
inflammations negatively impact the health of an infected person and lead to
grave secondary diseases. The gained rough estimates are compared with

target-prompt essays to award scores to a target-prompt essay. Since obtaining
a large quantity of pre-graded essays to a particular prompt is often difficult
and unrealistic, the task of cross-prompt AES is vital for the development of
real-world AES systems, yet it remains an under-explored area of research.
Models designed for prompt-specific AES rely heavily on prompt-specific
knowledge and perform poorly in the cross-prompt setting, whereas current
approaches to cross-prompt AES either require a certain quantity of labelled
target-prompt essays or require a large quantity of unlabelled target-prompt
essays to perform transfer learning in a multi-step manner. To address these
issues, we introduce Prompt Agnostic Essay Scorer (PAES) for cross-prompt AES.
Our method requires no access to labelled or unlabelled target-prompt data
during training and is a single-stage approach. PAES is easy to apply in
practice and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Automated Student

$1\to2$ splitting in both protons overlap with loop corrections to single
parton scattering (SPS). Any fundamental theoretical treatment of DPS needs to
address this double-counting issue. In this paper, we augment our Monte-Carlo
simulation of DPS, dShower, to be able to generate kinematic distributions
corresponding to the combination SPS+DPS without double counting. To achieve
this, we formulate a fully-differential version of the subtraction scheme
introduced in Diehl et al. (JHEP 06 (2017) 083). A shower is attached to the
subtraction term, and this is combined with the dShower DPS shower along with
the usual SPS shower. We perform a proof-of-concept study of this new algorithm
in the context of $\mathrm{Z}^0\mathrm{Z}^0$ production. Once the subtraction
term is included, we verify that the results do not depend strongly on the
artificial ""DPS-SPS demarcation"" scale $\nu$. As part of the development of the
new algorithm, we improve the kinematics of the $1\to2$ splitting in the DPS
shower (and subtraction term), allowing the daughter partons to have a relative
transverse momentum. Several reasonable choices for the transverse profile in
the $1\to2$ splitting are studied. We find that many kinematic distributions
are not strongly affected by the choice, although we do observe some
differences in the region where the transverse momenta of both bosons are
small.

mutation introduced in a population of residents survives and eventually even
spreads to the whole population, or gets extinct. The outcome naturally depends
on the fitness of the mutant and the rules by which mutants and residents may
propagate on the network, but arguably the most determining factor is the
network structure. Some structured networks are transient amplifiers. They
increase for a certain fitness range the fixation probability of beneficial
mutations as compared to a well-mixed population. We study a perturbation
methods for identifying transient amplifiers for death-Birth updating. The
method includes calculating the coalescence times of random walks on graphs and
finding the vertex with the largest remeeting time. If the graph is perturbed
by removing an edge from this vertex, there is a certain likelihood that the
resulting perturbed graph is a transient amplifier. We test all pairwise
nonisomorphic cubic and quartic regular graphs up to a certain size and thus
cover the whole structural range expressible by these graphs. We carry out a
spectral analysis and show that the graphs from which the transient amplifiers
can be constructed share certain structural properties. The graphs are
path-like, have low conductance and are rather easy to divide into subgraphs by
removing edges and/or vertices. This is connected with the subgraphs being
identical (or almost identical) building blocks and the frequent occurrence of
cut and/or hinge vertices. Identifying spectral and structural properties may
promote finding and designing such networks.

learning a model that quickly adapts to new classes with a few labeled support

reduction on unseen classes due to inappropriate use of high-level semantic
information of training classes and spatial inconsistency between query and
support targets. To alleviate these issues, we propose the Prior Guided Feature
Enrichment Network (PFENet). It consists of novel designs of (1) a
training-free prior mask generation method that not only retains generalization
power but also improves model performance and (2) Feature Enrichment Module
(FEM) that overcomes spatial inconsistency by adaptively enriching query
features with support features and prior masks. Extensive experiments on
PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO prove that the proposed prior generation method and FEM
both improve the baseline method significantly. Our PFENet also outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin without efficiency loss. It is
surprising that our model even generalizes to cases without labeled support

small-amplitude kink oscillation of a remote coronal loop. The oscillation
lasted for $\ge$4 cycles without significant damping. The amplitude and period
are 0.3$\pm$0.1 Mm and 207$\pm$12 s. Interestingly, the flare also excited
transverse oscillation of a remote filament. The oscillation lasted for
$\sim$3.5 cycles with decaying amplitudes. The initial amplitude is 1.7$-$2.2
Mm. The period and damping time are 437$-$475 s and 1142$-$1600 s. The starting
times of simultaneous oscillations of coronal loop and filament were concurrent
with the hard X-ray peak time. Though small in size and short in lifetime, the
flare set off a chain reaction. It generated a bright secondary flare ribbon
(SFR) in the chromosphere, remote brightening (RB) that was cospatial with the
filament, and intermittent, jet-like flow propagating in the northeast
direction. The loop oscillation is most probably excited by the flare-induced
blast wave at a speed of $\ge$1300 km s$^{-1}$. The excitation of the filament
oscillation is more complicated. The blast wave triggers secondary magnetic
reconnection far from the main flare, which not only heats the local plasma to
higher temperatures (SFR and RB), but produces jet-like flow (i.e.,
reconnection outflow) as well. The filament is disturbed by the secondary
magnetic reconnection and experiences transverse oscillation. The findings give
new insight into the excitation of transverse oscillations of coronal loops and
filaments.

the source domain is composed of complementary-label data, and a theoretical

that the source domain only contains complementary-label data (completely
complementary unsupervised domain adaptation, CC-UDA), and the other is that
the source domain has plenty of complementary-label data and a small amount of
true-label data (partly complementary unsupervised domain adaptation, PC-UDA).

innovative view of unequal training. For this reason, PAD is versatile and has
been applied in various tasks including classification, metric learning, and

connectivity and low-latency communications. Accurate and low-overhead channel
estimation in RIS-based systems is one of the most critical challenges due to
the usually large number of RIS unit elements and their distinctive hardware
constraints. In this paper, we focus on the uplink of a RIS-empowered
multi-user Multiple Input Single Output (MISO) uplink communication systems and
propose a channel estimation framework based on the parallel factor
decomposition to unfold the resulting cascaded channel model. We present two
iterative estimation algorithms for the channels between the base station and
RIS, as well as the channels between RIS and users. One is based on alternating
least squares (ALS), while the other uses vector approximate message passing to
iteratively reconstruct two unknown channels from the estimated vectors. To
theoretically assess the performance of the ALS-based algorithm, we derived its
estimation Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB). We also discuss the downlink achievable
sum rate computation with estimated channels and different precoding schemes
for the base station. Our extensive simulation results show that our algorithms
outperform benchmark schemes and that the ALS technique achieves the CRB. It is
also demonstrated that the sum rate using the estimated channels always reach
that of perfect channels under various settings, thus, verifying the
effectiveness and robustness of the proposed estimation algorithms.

resource-intensive is an important research direction in NLP. In this paper, we
focus on improving the efficiency of language pre-training methods through
providing better data utilization. It is well-known that in language data
corpus, words follow a heavy-tail distribution. A large proportion of words
appear only very few times and the embeddings of rare words are usually poorly
optimized. We argue that such embeddings carry inadequate semantic signals,
which could make the data utilization inefficient and slow down the
pre-training of the entire model. To mitigate this problem, we propose Taking
Notes on the Fly (TNF), which takes notes for rare words on the fly during
pre-training to help the model understand them when they occur next time.
Specifically, TNF maintains a note dictionary and saves a rare word's
contextual information in it as notes when the rare word occurs in a sentence.
When the same rare word occurs again during training, the note information
saved beforehand can be employed to enhance the semantics of the current
sentence. By doing so, TNF provides better data utilization since
cross-sentence information is employed to cover the inadequate semantics caused
by rare words in the sentences. We implement TNF on both BERT and ELECTRA to
check its efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results show that TNF's
training time is $60\%$ less than its backbone pre-training models when
reaching the same performance. When trained with the same number of iterations,
TNF outperforms its backbone methods on most of downstream tasks and the
average GLUE score. Source code is attached in the supplementary material.

a realistic, detailed picture of LeX-LeX interactions in solution and during

LeX pairs interact in a large variety of short-lived, bound conformations. For
the synthetic tetrasaccharide Lac 2, which is composed of two lactose units, we
observe similarly fuzzy interactions and obtain association constants of both

of small, neutral carbohydrates such as LeX and Lac 2.

the LB equation via a forcing term. Although this class of free-energy LB
models may be thermodynamically consistent at the continuum level, it suffers
from thermodynamic inconsistency at the discrete lattice level owing to
numerical errors [Guo et al., Physical Review E 83, 036707 (2011)]. The

diagnosis requires not only near-perfect precision, but also a sufficient
degree of generalization to data acquisition shifts and transparency. Existing
CNN models act as black boxes, not ensuring to the physicians that important
diagnostic features are used by the model. Building on top of successfully
existing techniques such as multi-task learning, domain adversarial training
and concept-based interpretability, this paper addresses the challenge of
introducing diagnostic factors in the training objectives. Here we show that
our architecture, by learning end-to-end an uncertainty-based weighting
combination of multi-task and adversarial losses, is encouraged to focus on
pathology features such as density and pleomorphism of nuclei, e.g. variations
in size and appearance, while discarding misleading features such as staining
differences. Our results on breast lymph node tissue show significantly
improved generalization in the detection of tumorous tissue, with best average
AUC 0.89 (0.01) against the baseline AUC 0.86 (0.005). By applying the
interpretability technique of linearly probing intermediate representations, we
also demonstrate that interpretable pathology features such as nuclei density
are learned by the proposed CNN architecture, confirming the increased
transparency of this model. This result is a starting point towards building

particularly fruitful application of quantum algorithms, covering aspects of

offers numerous options of how quantum theory can be applied, and is arguably
the least explored, from a quantum perspective. Here, an agent explores an
environment and tries to find a behavior optimizing some figure of merit. Some
of the first approaches investigated settings where this exploration can be
sped-up, by considering quantum analogs of classical environments, which can
then be queried in superposition. If the environments have a strict periodic
structure in time (i.e. are strictly episodic), such environments can be
effectively converted to conventional oracles encountered in quantum
information. However, in general environments, we obtain scenarios that
generalize standard oracle tasks. In this work we consider one such
generalization, where the environment is not strictly episodic, which is mapped
to an oracle identification setting with a changing oracle. We analyze this
case and show that standard amplitude-amplification techniques can, with minor
modifications, still be applied to achieve quadratic speed-ups, and that this
approach is optimal for certain settings. This results constitutes one of the
first generalizations of quantum-accessible reinforcement learning.

taken with a high-resolution Antera 3D CS camera at the start and end of a
4-week period. Additionally, they each had ``selfies'' of the same regions of

collect real depths or to hand-design synthetic data. We can consequently train
a stereo matching network from scratch on datasets like COCO, which were

that our approach outperforms stereo networks trained with standard synthetic

superior to any or, at least, to most of the individual estimates is known as
the wisdom of crowds. Here we use the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's
Survey of Professional Forecasters database to confront the statistical and
psychophysical explanations of this phenomenon. Overall we find that the data
do not support any of the proposed explanations of the wisdom of crowds. In
particular, we find a positive correlation between the variance (or diversity)
of the estimates and the crowd error in disagreement with some interpretations
of the diversity prediction theorem. In addition, contra the predictions of the
psychophysical augmented quincunx model, we find that the skew of the estimates
offers no information about the crowd error. More importantly, we find that the
crowd beats all individuals in less than 2% of the forecasts and beats most
individuals in less than 70% of the forecasts, which means that there is a
sporting chance that an individual selected at random will perform better than
the crowd. These results contrast starkly with the performance of non-natural
crowds composed of unbiased forecasters which beat most individuals in
practically all forecasts. The moderate statistical advantage of a real-world
crowd over its members does not justify the ado about its wisdom, which is most
likely a product of the selective attention fallacy.

faithful interpolation between data points, as we show herein, but can also be
used as a general regularization technique to avoid overfitting or to produce

prosody modeling is the lack of reference that makes explicit modeling
difficult. The proposed technique doesn't require prosody annotations from
training data. It doesn't attempt to model prosody explicitly either, but
rather encodes the association between input text and its prosody styles using
a Tacotron-based TTS framework. Our proposed idea marks a departure from the
style token paradigm where prosody is explicitly modeled by a bank of prosody
embeddings. The proposed training strategy adopts a combination of two
objective functions: 1) frame level reconstruction loss, that is calculated
between the synthesized and target spectral features; 2) utterance level style
reconstruction loss, that is calculated between the deep style features of
synthesized and target speech. The proposed style reconstruction loss is
formulated as a perceptual loss to ensure that utterance level speech style is
taken into consideration during training. Experiments show that the proposed
training strategy achieves remarkable performance and outperforms a
state-of-the-art baseline in both naturalness and expressiveness. To our best
knowledge, this is the first study to incorporate utterance level perceptual
quality as a loss function into Tacotron training for improved expressiveness.

wellposedness of partial differential equations (PDEs). Numerically, these
conditions can be enforced exactly in classical numerical methods, such as
finite difference method and finite element method. Recent years have witnessed
growing interests in solving PDEs by deep neural networks (DNNs), especially in
the high-dimensional case. However, in the generic situation, a careful
literature review shows that boundary conditions cannot be enforced exactly for
DNNs, which inevitably leads to a modeling error. In this work, based on the
recently developed deep mixed residual method (MIM), we demonstrate how to make
DNNs satisfy boundary and initial conditions automatically in a systematic
manner. As a consequence, the loss function in MIM is free of the penalty term
and does not have any modeling error. Using numerous examples, including
Dirichlet, Neumann, mixed, Robin, and periodic boundary conditions for elliptic
equations, and initial conditions for parabolic and hyperbolic equations, we
show that enforcing exact boundary and initial conditions not only provides a
better approximate solution but also facilitates the training process.

presence of dephasing noise using numerical methods. While attaining the HCRB
may require collective measurements over infinitely many copies, we find that
for high noise the HCRB is practically saturated by two copies only. In the low
noise regime, up to three copies are unable to attain the HCRB. More generally,
we introduce new multiparameter channel bounds to compare quantum-classical and
classical-quantum strategies where multiple independent copies of the state are
entangled before or after recording the parameters respectively. We find that
their relative performance depends on the noise strength, with
theclassical-quantum strategy performing better for high noise. We end with
shallow quantum circuits that approach the fundamental quantum limit set by the

used in large-scale image retrieval tasks. Hash bucket search returns data
points within a given Hamming radius to each query, which can enable search at
a constant or sub-linear time cost. However, existing hashing methods cannot
achieve satisfactory retrieval performance for hash bucket search in complex
scenarios, since they learn only one hash code for each image. More
specifically, by using one hash code to represent one image, existing methods
might fail to put similar image pairs to the buckets with a small Hamming
distance to the query when the semantic information of images is complex. As a
result, a large number of hash buckets need to be visited for retrieving
similar images, based on the learned codes. This will deteriorate the
efficiency of hash bucket search. In this paper, we propose a novel hashing
framework, called multiple code hashing (MCH), to improve the performance of
hash bucket search. The main idea of MCH is to learn multiple hash codes for
each image, with each code representing a different region of the image.
Furthermore, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to learn the
parameters in MCH. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
proposes to learn multiple hash codes for each image in image retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate that MCH can achieve a significant improvement in hash
bucket search, compared with existing methods that learn only one hash code for
each image.

additional 2-form $\zeta$ in the field strength. We will study this theory in
the simplified situation of Lie algebra bundles, hence, only massless gauge

classify $\nabla$ using the gauge invariance, resulting into that $\nabla$
needs to be a Lie derivation law covering a pairing $\Xi$, as introduced by
Mackenzie. There is also a field redefinition, keeping the physics invariant,
but possibly changing $\zeta$ and the curvature of $\nabla$. We are going to
study whether this can lead to a classical theory, and we will realize that
this has a strong correspondence to Mackenzie's study about extending Lie
algebroids with Lie algebra bundles. We show that Mackenzie's obstruction class
is also an obstruction for having non-flat connections which are not related to
a flat connection using the field redefinitions. This class is related to
$\mathrm{d}^\nabla \zeta$, a tensor which also measures the failure of the
Bianchi identity of the field strength and which is invariant under the field
redefinition. This tensor will also provide hints about whether $\zeta$ can
vanish after a field redefinition.

Experimental results show that the proposed encodings outperform one of the two
reasoners, but fall behind the other, an acceptable trade-off given the added
benefits of handling any type of reasoning as well as the interpretability of

algorithm achieves optimality by adaptively scheduling transmissions relative
to each user's stochastic traffic demands. To implement the method, users must
report their queue backlogs to the network controller and must rapidly respond
to the resulting resource allocations. However, many currently-deployed
wireless systems are not able to perform these tasks and instead expect to
occupy a fixed assignment of resources. To accommodate these limitations,
adaptive scheduling algorithms need to interactively estimate these
uncooperative users' queue backlogs and make scheduling decisions to account
for their predicted behavior. In this work, we address the problem of
scheduling with uncooperative legacy systems by developing algorithms to
accomplish these tasks. We begin by formulating the problem of inferring the

relic density constraint provides a lower bound on the stop and gluino masses
of about 3 TeV and 4 TeV respectively, which is testable in the near future

not be the optimal choice, since a single network may misses some aspects.
Consequently, it has been proposed to use a pair of networks to better model
all the aspects, and the main approach is referred to as dual networks (DNs).
DNs are two related graphs (one weighted, the other unweighted) that share the
same set of vertices and two different edge sets. In DNs is often interesting
to extract common subgraphs among the two networks that are maximally dense in
the conceptual network and connected in the physical one. The simplest instance
of this problem is finding a common densest connected subgraph (DCS), while we

set k subgraphs having the largest density in the conceptual network which are
also connected in the physical network. We formalise the problem and then we
propose a heuristic to find a solution, since the problem is computationally
hard. A set of experiments on synthetic and real networks is also presented to

formulation to achieve simultaneous maximum consensus and model estimation
(MCME), which has two significant features compared with traditional MC robust
fitting. First, it takes fitting residual into account in finding inliers,
hence its lowest achievable residual in model fitting is lower than that of MC
robust fitting. Second, it has an unconstrained formulation involving binary
variables, which facilitates the use of the effective semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) method to handle the underlying challenging combinatorial optimization
problem. Though still nonconvex after SDR, it becomes biconvex in some
applications, for which we use an alternating minimization algorithm to solve.
Further, the sparsity of the problem is exploited in combination with low-rank
factorization to develop an efficient algorithm. Experiments show that MCME
significantly outperforms RANSAC and deterministic approximate MC methods at
high outlier ratios. Besides, in rotation and Euclidean registration, it also
compares favorably with state-of-the-art registration methods, especially in

Spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources can produce entangled photons
with correlations close to the Tsirelson bound. Sagnac configurations offer
intrinsic stability, compact footprint and high collection efficiency, however,
there is often a trade off between source brightness and entanglement
visibility. Here, we present a Sagnac polarization-entangled source with
$2\sqrt{2}-S=(5.65\pm0.57)\times10^{-3}$, on-par with the highest values
recorded, while generating and detecting $(4660\pm70)$ pairs/s/mW, which is a

the highest $S$ parameter. Our source records $0.9953\pm0.0003$ concurrence and
$0.99743\pm0.00014$ fidelity to an ideal Bell state. By studying systematic
errors in Sagnac sources, we identify that the precision of the collection

provide user with an adapted and efficient framework to ease the analysis of

contrast because of the fluctuations of the wave velocities in the Earth's
crust. In the literature, phase distortion issues are generally circumvented by
means of a background wave velocity model. However, it requires a prior
tomography of the wave velocity distribution in the medium, which is often not
possible, especially in depth. In this paper, a matrix approach of seismic
imaging is developed to retrieve a three-dimensional image of the subsoil,
despite a rough knowledge of the background wave velocity. To do so, passive
noise cross-correlations between geophones of a seismic array are investigated
under a matrix formalism. More precisely, the detrimental effect of wave
velocity fluctuations on imaging is overcome by introducing a novel
mathematical object: The distortion matrix. This operator essentially connects
any virtual source inside the medium with the distortion that a wavefront,
emitted from that point, experiences due to heterogeneities. A time reversal
analysis of the distortion matrix enables the estimation of the transmission
matrix that links each real geophone at the surface and each virtual geophone
in depth. Phase distortions can then be compensated for any point of the
underground. Applied to seismic data recorded along the Clark branch of the San
Jacinto fault zone, the present method is shown to provide an image of the
fault until a depth of 4 km with a transverse resolution of 80 m. Strikingly,
this resolution is almost one eighth below the diffraction limit imposed by the
geophone array aperture. The heterogeneities of the subsoil play the role of a
scattering lens and of a transverse wave guide which increase drastically the
array aperture.

interactive online question pools. Specifically, we model the relationship
between students and questions using student interactions to construct the
student-interaction-question network and further present a new GNN model,
called R^2GCN, which intrinsically works for the heterogeneous networks, to
achieve generalizable student performance prediction in interactive online
question pools. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world
dataset consisting of 104,113 mouse trajectories generated in the
problem-solving process of over 4000 students on 1631 questions. The experiment
results show that our approach can achieve a much higher accuracy of student
performance prediction than both traditional machine learning approaches and
GNN models.

Diagnosis of UC is based on clinical symptoms, and then confirmed based on
endoscopic, histologic and laboratory findings. Feature selection and machine
learning have been previously used for creating models to facilitate the
diagnosis of certain diseases. In this work, we used a recently developed
feature selection algorithm (DRPT) combined with a support vector machine (SVM)
classifier to generate a model to discriminate between healthy subjects and
subjects with UC based on the expression values of 32 genes in colon samples.
We validated our model with an independent gene expression dataset of colonic
samples from subjects in active and inactive periods of UC. Our model perfectly
detected all active cases and had an average precision of 0.62 in the inactive
cases. Compared with results reported in previous studies and a model generated
by a recently published software for biomarker discovery using machine learning
(BioDiscML), our final model for detecting UC shows better performance in terms
of average precision.

evaded by formulating quantum field theories on manifolds where the imaginary

to the fact that one in general needs to collect contributions coming from more
than one thimble. Here we explore the idea of performing Taylor expansions on
Lefschetz thimbles. We show that in some cases we can compute expansions in
regions where only the dominant thimble contributes to the result in such a way
that these (different, disjoint) regions can be bridged. This can most
effectively be done via Pad\'e approximants. In this way multi-thimble
simulations can be circumvented. The approach can be trusted provided we can
show that the analytic continuation we are performing is a legitimate one,

supposed to be valuable not only in the thimble approach, which thing we

illustrate how graphical class and state diagrams from UML can be developed and
critiqued with subject matter experts to serve as specifications of the

translate UML class and state diagrams for verification of solvability with

transition in a widely studied model system of allostery, the PDZ2 domain, is
investigated by transient infrared spectroscopy accompanied by molecular
dynamics simulations. To this end, an azobenzene derived photoswitch is linked
to a peptide ligand in a way that its binding affinity to the PDZ2 domain
changes upon switching, thus initiating an allosteric transition in the PDZ2
domain protein. The subsequent response of the protein, covering four decades
of time ranging from $\sim$1~ns to $\sim$10~$\mu$s, can be rationalize by a
remodelling of its rugged free energy landscape, with ver subtle shifts in the
populations of a small number of structurally well defined states. It is
proposed that structurally and dynamically driven allostery, often discussed as
limiting scenarios of allosteric communication, actually go hand-in-hand,
allowing the protein to adapt its free energy landscape to incoming signals.

switching and model learning to achieve safe velocity regulation of
self-driving vehicles in dynamic and unforeseen environments. To guarantee the
reliability of autonomous vehicles, an $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ adaptive controller
that compensates for uncertainties and disturbances is employed by the Simplex
architecture as a verified safe controller to tolerate concurrent software and
physical failures. Meanwhile, safe switching controller is incorporated into
the Simplex for safe velocity regulation through the integration of the
traction control system and anti-lock braking system. Specifically, the
vehicle's angular and longitudinal velocities asymptotically track the provided
references that vary with driving environments, while the wheel slips are
restricted to safety envelopes to prevent slipping and sliding. Due to the high
dependence of vehicle dynamics on the driving environments, the proposed
Simplex leverages the finite-time model learning to timely learn and update the
vehicle model for $\mathcal{L}_{1}$ adaptive controller, when any deviation
from the safety envelope or the uncertainty measurement threshold occurs in the
unforeseen driving environments. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed
Simplex architecture for safe velocity regulation is validated by the AutoRally

compensated semimetals can be greatly enhanced over the electric conductivity
by the availability of an ambipolar mechanism of conduction, whereby electrons
and holes flow in the same direction experiencing negligible Coulomb scattering
as well as negligible impurity scattering. This enhancement -- resulting in a
breakdown of the Wiedemann-Franz law with an anomalously large Lorenz ratio --
has been recently observed in two-dimensional monolayer and bilayer graphene
near the charge neutrality point. In contrast to this, three-dimensional
compensated semimetals such as WP$_2$ and Sb are typically found to show a
reduced Lorenz ratio. This dramatic difference in behavior is generally
attributed to different regimes of Fermi statistics in the two cases:
degenerate electron-hole liquid in compensated semimetals versus non-degenerate
electron-hole liquid in graphene. We show that this difference is not
sufficient to explain the reduction of the Lorenz ratio in compensated
semimetals. We argue that the solution of the puzzle lies in the ability of
compensated semimetals to sustain sizeable regions of electron-hole
accumulation near the contacts, which in turn is a consequence of the large
separation of electron and hole pockets in momentum space. These accumulations
suppress the ambipolar conduction mechanism and effectively split the system
into two independent electron and hole conductors. We present a quantitative
theory of the crossover from ambipolar to unipolar conduction as a function of
the size of the electron-hole accumulation regions, and show that it naturally
leads to a sample-size-dependent thermal conductivity.

plays a vital role in many environment modeling and land use inventories. In
this study, a hybrid feature optimization algorithm along with a deep learning
classifier is proposed to improve the performance of LULC classification,
helping to predict wildlife habitat, deteriorating environmental quality,
haphazard, etc. LULC classification is assessed using Sat 4, Sat 6 and Eurosat
datasets. After the selection of remote sensing images, normalization and
histogram equalization methods are used to improve the quality of the images.
Then, a hybrid optimization is accomplished by using the Local Gabor Binary
Pattern Histogram Sequence (LGBPHS), the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG)
and Haralick texture features, for the feature extraction from the selected
images. The benefits of this hybrid optimization are a high discriminative
power and invariance to color and grayscale images. Next, a Human Group based
Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is applied to select the optimal
features, whose benefits are fast convergence rate and easy to implement. After
selecting the optimal feature values, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network
is utilized to classify the LULC classes. Experimental results showed that the
Human Group based PSO algorithm with a LSTM classifier effectively well
differentiates the land use and land cover classes in terms of classification
accuracy, recall and precision. An improvement of 2.56% in accuracy is achieved
compared to the existing models GoogleNet, VGG, AlexNet, ConvNet, when the

spectroscopy of resolved stellar populations in the LG provides kinematical and
chemical information for individual stars that can be used to infer the history
of $L_\star$ galaxies like the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31). The Gaia
revolution in the MW has enabled comprehensive observational studies of the
MW's formation history. The exquisite detail in which the MW has been studied
is currently not achievable in any other $L_\star$ galaxy. For this reason, the
MW is a template for our understanding of galaxy formation. M31 is the only
external galaxy that we can currently hope study in a level of detail
approaching the MW. Studies of M31 have recently taken on greater significance,
given the growing body of evidence that its formation history differs
substantially from that of the MW. In an era of limited information about
elemental abundances in M31, I have developed a technique to apply spectral
synthesis to low-resolution stellar spectroscopy in order to measure abundances
for individual giant stars in distant LG galaxies. Through undertaking the
largest deep, spectroscopic survey of M31 to date with my collaborators, this
has resulted in the first measurements of the elemental abundances in the inner
stellar halo and stellar disk of M31, and the largest homogeneous catalog of
elemental abundances in M31. With this foundational work, we have opened the
doors to detailed studies of the chemical composition of M31. Now, we can begin
to ask--and answer--what differences in the elemental abundances of the M31 and
the MW imply for our knowledge of galaxy formation in the broader universe.

program is required to play a variety of games successfully. It acts as a test
bed for AI and motivator of research. The AI is given a random game description
at runtime which it then plays. The framework includes repositories of game
rules. The Inductive General Game Playing (IGGP) problem challenges machine
learning systems to learn these GGP game rules by watching the game being
played. In other words, IGGP is the problem of inducing general game rules from
specific game observations. Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) has shown to be a
promising approach to this problem though it has been demonstrated that it is
still a hard problem for ILP systems. Existing work on IGGP has always assumed
that the game player being observed makes random moves. This is not
representative of how a human learns to play a game. With random gameplay
situations that would normally be encountered when humans play are not present.
To address this limitation, we analyse the effect of using intelligent versus
random gameplay traces as well as the effect of varying the number of traces in
the training set. We use Sancho, the 2014 GGP competition winner, to generate
intelligent game traces for a large number of games. We then use the ILP
systems, Metagol, Aleph and ILASP to induce game rules from the traces. We
train and test the systems on combinations of intelligent and random data
including a mixture of both. We also vary the volume of training data. Our
results show that whilst some games were learned more effectively in some of
the experiments than others no overall trend was statistically significant. The
implications of this work are that varying the quality of training data as
described in this paper has strong effects on the accuracy of the learned game
rules; however one solution does not work for all games.

in research, especially when it is due to privacy concerns. This is
particularly true for location data since previous techniques all suffer from
the inherent sparseness and high dimensionality of location trajectories which
render most techniques impractical, resulting in unrealistic traces and
unscalable methods. Moreover, time information of location visits is usually
dropped, or its resolution is drastically reduced. In this paper we present a
novel technique for privately releasing a composite generative model and whole
high-dimensional location datasets with detailed time information. To generate
high-fidelity synthetic data, we leverage several peculiarities of vehicular
mobility such as its language-like characteristics (""you should know a location
by the company it keeps"") or how humans plan their trips from one point to the
other. We model the generator distribution of the dataset by first constructing
a variational autoencoder to generate the source and destination locations, and
the corresponding timing of trajectories. Next, we compute transition
probabilities between locations with a feed forward network, and build a
transition graph from the output of this model, which approximates the
distribution of all paths between the source and destination (at a given time).
Finally, a path is sampled from this distribution with a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo method. The generated synthetic dataset is highly realistic, scalable,
provides good utility and, nonetheless, provably private. We evaluate our model
against two state-of-the-art methods and three real-life datasets demonstrating
the benefits of our approach.

  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2008.00889",,,,"eess.AS cs.SD","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Acoustic-to-articulatory inversion (AAI) methods estimate articulatory
movements from the acoustic speech signal, which can be useful in several tasks
such as speech recognition, synthesis, talking heads and language tutoring.
Most earlier inversion studies are based on point-tracking articulatory
techniques (e.g. EMA or XRMB). The advantage of rtMRI is that it provides
dynamic information about the full midsagittal plane of the upper airway, with
a high 'relative' spatial resolution. In this work, we estimated midsagittal
rtMRI images of the vocal tract for speaker dependent AAI, using MGC-LSP
spectral features as input. We applied FC-DNNs, CNNs and recurrent neural
networks, and have shown that LSTMs are the most suitable for this task. As
objective evaluation we measured normalized MSE, Structural Similarity Index
(SSIM) and its complex wavelet version (CW-SSIM). The results indicate that the
combination of FC-DNNs and LSTMs can achieve smooth generated MR images of the
vocal tract, which are similar to the original MRI recordings (average CW-SSIM:

Using mathematical tools from stochastic geometry, we derive an upper bound on
the average interference power at the radar due to the 3D massive MIMO cellular
downlink under the worst-case `cell-edge beamforming' conditions. To overcome
the technical challenges imposed by asymmetric and arbitrarily large cells, we
devise a novel construction in which each Poisson Voronoi (PV) cell is bounded
by its circumcircle to bound the effect of the random cell shapes on average
interference. Since this model is intractable for further analysis due to the
correlation between adjacent PV cells' shapes and sizes, we propose a tractable
nominal interference model, where we model each PV cell as a circular disk with
an area equal to the average area of the typical cell. We quantify the gap in
the average interference power between these two models and show that the upper
bound is tight for realistic deployment parameters. We also compare them with a
more practical but intractable MU-MIMO scheduling model to show that our
worst-case interference models show the same trends and do not deviate
significantly from realistic scheduler models. Under the nominal interference
model, we characterize the interference distribution using the dominant
interferer approximation by deriving the equi-interference contour expression
when the typical receiver uses 3D beamforming. Finally, we use tractable
expressions for the interference distribution to characterize radar's spatial
probability of false alarm/detection in a quasi-static target tracking
scenario. Our results reveal useful trends in the average interference as a
function of the deployment parameters (BS density, exclusion zone radius,
antenna height, transmit power of each BS, etc.).

exploiting the complementarity structure of contact dynamics. Since many
robotic tasks, like manipulation and locomotion, are fundamentally based in
making and breaking contact with the environment, state-of-the-art control
policies struggle to deal with the hybrid nature of multi-contact motion. Such
controllers often rely heavily upon heuristics or, due to the combinatorial
structure in the dynamics, are unsuitable for real-time control. Principled
deployment of tactile sensors offers a promising mechanism for stable and
robust control, but modern approaches often use this data in an ad hoc manner,
for instance to guide guarded moves. This framework can close the loop on
tactile sensors and it is non-combinatorial, enabling optimization algorithms
to automatically synthesize provably stable control policies. We demonstrate
this approach on multiple numerical examples, including quasi-static friction
problems and a high dimensional problem with ten contacts. We also validate our
results on an experimental setup and show the effectiveness of the proposed
method on an underactuated multi-contact system.

\cite{Our}, we show in this article that the first hypothesis on the damping
coefficient $\mu$, namely $\mu < \frac{N(q-1)}{2}$, can be removed, and the
second one can be extended from $(0, \mu_*/2)$ to $(0, \mu_*)$ where $\mu_*>0$
is solution of $(q-1)\left((N+\mu_*-1)p-2\right) = 4$. Indeed, owing to a
better understanding of the influence of the damping term in the global
dynamics of the solution, we think that this new interval for $\mu$ describe
better the threshold between the blow-up and the global existence regions.
Moreover, taking advantage of the techniques employed in the problem $(E)$, we
also improve the result in \cite{LT2,Palmieri} in relationship with the Glassey
conjecture for the solution of $(E)$ but without the nonlinear term $|u|^q$.
More precisely, we extend the blow-up region from $p \in (1, p_G(N+\sigma)]$,

giving thus a better estimate of the lifespan in this case.

odd integers that are, in turn, divided into categories based on the roles they
play such as Starter, Intermediary and Terminal. The expression 4x+1 is used as
a tool to expose all the hidden and significant characteristics of the
conjecture that lead us to its proof. The mixing properties of the iterates are
addressed by showing that the Collatz iterates of half of all the odd integers
that are of the form 4m+3, on the average, increase by three times the value of
the odd integer that was used to start with, while the iterates of those of
4m+1, on the average, decrease by a factor of four. Further, expressions are
provided to generate all the sets of odd integers where the Collatz iterate of
all the integers in each set is an integer of the of form 6m+1 or 6m+5. The
significance of the Collatz net (tree) becomes obvious since it encompasses all

O(n) $ requires $ O(n^2) $ gates and at least one ancillary qubits, while that
realized by using quantum Fourier transform (QFT) requires $ O(n^3) $ gates
without ancillary qubit. The proposed quantum circuit to estimate pi is based
on the Monte Carlo method, quantum amplitude estimation, and quantum squarer.
By applying the quantum squarer using QFT, the circuit was implemented in $ 4n

a quantum computer simulator with $ n $ being varied from 2 to 6, and the
obtained result was compared with the one obtained by performing a classical

For two audio clips with M and N frames, respectively, the most popular
approach, dynamic time warping (DTW), has O(MN) requirements in both memory and
computation, which is prohibitive for frame-level alignments at reasonable
rates. To address this, a variety of memory efficient algorithms exist to
approximate the optimal alignment under the DTW cost. To our knowledge,
however, no exact algorithms exist that are guaranteed to break the quadratic
memory barrier. In this work, we present a divide and conquer algorithm that
computes the exact globally optimal DTW alignment using O(M+N) memory. Its
runtime is still O(MN), trading off memory for a 2x increase in computation.
However, the algorithm can be parallelized up to a factor of min(M, N) with the
same memory constraints, so it can still run more efficiently than the textbook
version with an adequate GPU. We use our algorithm to compute exact alignments
on a collection of orchestral music, which we use as ground truth to benchmark
the alignment accuracy of several popular approximate alignment schemes at
scales that were not previously possible.

investigates the network controllability robustness from the perspective of a

edge- or node-removal attacks. Edges (or nodes) in a target network are
classified hierarchically into categories, with different priorities to attack.
The category of critical edges (or nodes) has the highest priority to be
selected for attack. Extensive experiments on nine synthetic networks and nine

proposed. It was Mendeleev who proposed a periodic table based on the extensive
periodic law and predicted a number of unknown elements at that time. The
periodic table currently used worldwide is of a long form pioneered by Werner
in 1905. As the first topic, we describe the work of Pfeiffer (1920), who
refined Werner's work and rearranged the rare-earth elements in a separate
table below the main table for convenience. Today's widely used periodic table
essentially inherits Pfeiffer's arrangements. Although long-form tables more
precisely represent electron orbitals around a nucleus, they lose some of the
features of Mendeleev's short-form table to express similarities of chemical
properties of elements when forming compounds. As the second topic, we compare
various three-dimensional helical periodic tables that resolve some of the
shortcomings of the long-form periodic tables in this respect. In particular,
we explain how the 3D periodic table ""Elementouch"" (Maeno 2001), which combines
the s- and p-blocks into one tube, can recover features of Mendeleev's periodic
law. Finally we introduce a topic on the recently proposed nuclear periodic
table based on the proton magic numbers (Hagino and Maeno 2020). Here, the
nuclear shell structure leads to a new arrangement of the elements with the
proton magic-number nuclei treated like noble-gas atoms. We show that the
resulting alignments of the elements in both the atomic and nuclear periodic
tables are common over about two thirds of the tables because of a fortuitous
coincidence in their magic numbers.
