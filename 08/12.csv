to zero transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$). The J/$\psi$ and $\psi$(2S)
production cross sections are evaluated as a function of the collision
centrality, estimated through the energy deposited in the zero degree
calorimeter located in the Pb-going direction. The $p_{\rm T}$-differential
J/$\psi$ production cross section is measured at backward and forward rapidity
for several centrality classes, together with the corresponding average
$\langle p_{\rm T} \rangle$ and $\langle p^{2}_{\rm T} \rangle$ values. The
nuclear effects affecting the production of both charmonium states are studied
using the nuclear modification factor. In the p-going direction, a suppression
of the production of both charmonium states is observed, which seems to
increase from peripheral to central collisions. In the Pb-going direction,
however, the centrality dependence is different for the two states: the nuclear
modification factor of the J/$\psi$ increases from below unity in peripheral
collisions to above unity in central collisions, while for the $\psi$(2S) it
stays below or consistent with unity for all centralities with no significant
centrality dependence. The results are compared with measurements in p-Pb
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV and no significant dependence on

gold standards of today's diagnostic imaging. The most significant drawback of
MRI is long acquisition times, prohibiting its use in standard practice for
some applications. Compressed sensing (CS) proposes to subsample the k-space
(the Fourier domain dual to the physical space of spatial coordinates) leading
to significantly accelerated acquisition. However, the benefit of compressed
sensing has not been fully exploited; most of the sampling densities obtained
through CS do not produce a trajectory that obeys the stringent constraints of
the MRI machine imposed in practice. Inspired by recent success of deep
learning based approaches for image reconstruction and ideas from computational
imaging on learning-based design of imaging systems, we introduce 3D FLAT, a
novel protocol for data-driven design of 3D non-Cartesian accelerated
trajectories in MRI. Our proposal leverages the entire 3D k-space to
simultaneously learn a physically feasible acquisition trajectory with a
reconstruction method. Experimental results, performed as a proof-of-concept,
suggest that 3D FLAT achieves higher image quality for a given readout time
compared to standard trajectories such as radial, stack-of-stars, or 2D learned
trajectories (trajectories that evolve only in the 2D plane while fully
sampling along the third dimension). Furthermore, we demonstrate evidence
supporting the significant benefit of performing MRI acquisitions using
non-Cartesian 3D trajectories over 2D non-Cartesian trajectories acquired
slice-wise.

correcting code with exact complementary recovery. We show that the map is
determined by local conditional expectations acting on the operator algebras of
the boundary/physical Hilbert space. Several existing results in the literature
follow easily from this perspective. The Black Hole area law, and more
generally the Ryu-Takayanagi area operator, arises from a central sum of
entropies on the relative commutant. These entropies are determined in a state
independent way by the conditional expectation. The conditional expectation can
also be found via a minimization procedure, similar to the minimization
involved in the RT formula. For a local net of algebras associated to connected
boundary regions, we show the complementary recovery condition is equivalent to
the existence of a standard net of inclusions -- an abstraction of the
mathematical structure governing QFT superselection sectors given by Longo and
Rehren. For a code consisting of algebras associated to two disjoint regions of
the boundary theory we impose an extra condition, dubbed dual-additivity, that
gives rise to phase transitions between different entanglement wedges.
Dual-additive codes naturally give rise to a new split code subspace, and an
entropy bound controls which subspace and associated algebra is
reconstructable. We also discuss known shortcomings of exact complementary
recovery as a model of holography. For example, these codes are not able to
accommodate holographic violations of additive for overlapping regions. We
comment on how approximate codes can fix these issues.

determine the size and albedo of Varda and constrain its 3D shape and density.
Thirteen different sites in the USA monitored the event, five of which detected
an occultation by the main body. A best-fitting ellipse to the occultation
chords provides the instantaneous limb of the body, from which the geometric
albedo is computed. The size and shape of Varda are evaluated, and its bulk
density is constrained, using Varda's mass known from previous works. The
best-fitting elliptical limb has semi-major (equatorial) axis of $(383 \pm
3)$km and an apparent oblateness $0.066\pm0.047$ corresponding to an apparent
area-equivalent radius $R'_{\rm equiv}= (370\pm7)$km and geometric albedo
$p_v=0.099\pm 0.002 $ assuming a visual absolute magnitude $H_V=3.81\pm0.01$.

we derive corresponding MacLaurin solutions. Furthermore, given the
low-amplitude ($0.06\pm0.01$) mag of the single-peaked rotational light-curve

homogenization limit for the normal deviation can be quite different due to the
difference in the interactions between the fast scales and the deviation
scales. We provide quite intuitive explanations for each case. Furthermore,
sharp rates both for the strong convergences and the functional central limit
theorems are obtained, and these convergences are shown to rely only on the
regularity of the coefficients of the system with respect to the slow variable,
and do not depend on their regularity with respect to the fast variable, which
coincide with the intuition since in the limit equations the fast component has
been totally averaged or homogenized out.

individual functions, in contrast to complete virtual machines or Linux
containers. All major cloud providers offer FaaS products (Amazon Lambda,
Google Cloud Functions, Azure Serverless); there are also popular open-source
implementations (Apache OpenWhisk) with commercial offerings (Adobe I/O
Runtime, IBM Cloud Functions). A new feature of FaaS is function composition: a
function may (sequentially) call another function, which, in turn, may call yet
another function - forming a chain of invocations. From the perspective of the
infrastructure, a composed FaaS is less opaque than a virtual machine or a
container. We show that this additional information enables the infrastructure
to reduce the response latency. In particular, knowing the sequence of future
invocations, the infrastructure can schedule these invocations along with
environment preparation. We model resource management in FaaS as a scheduling
problem combining (1) sequencing of invocations, (2) deploying execution
environments on machines, and (3) allocating invocations to deployed
environments. For each aspect, we propose heuristics. We explore their
performance by simulation on a range of synthetic workloads. Our results show
that if the setup times are long compared to invocation times, algorithms that
use information about the composition of functions consistently outperform
greedy, myopic algorithms, leading to significant decrease in response latency.

  1) $LH_n$ is finite dimensional over a field.
  2) The natural inclusion $LB_n \rightarrow LB_{n+1}$ passes to an inclusion
$SP_n \rightarrow SP_{n+1}$.
  3) Over $k=\mathbb{C}$, $SP_n / rad $ is generically the sum of simple matrix
algebras of dimension (and Bratteli diagram) given by Pascal's triangle.
  4) We determine the other fundamental invariants of $SP_n$ representation
theory: the Cartan decomposition matrix; and the quiver, which is of type-A.

to tackle this problem. However, existing methods are either based on
unexplainable deep networks which greatly degrades the principal
interpretability factor to media forensic, or rely on fragile image statistics
such as noise pattern, which in real-world scenarios can be easily deteriorated
by data compression. In this paper, we propose an fully-interpretable video
forensic method that is designed specifically to expose deep-faked videos. To
enhance generalizability on videos with various content, we model the temporal
motion of multiple specific spatial locations in the videos to extract a robust
and reliable representation, called Co-Motion Pattern. Such kind of conjoint
pattern is mined across local motion features which is independent of the video
contents so that the instance-wise variation can also be largely alleviated.
More importantly, our proposed co-motion pattern possesses both superior
interpretability and sufficient robustness against data compression for
deep-faked videos. We conduct extensive experiments to empirically demonstrate
the superiority and effectiveness of our approach under both classification and

vital when developing a patient-specific physiological model because it can
quantify model output uncertainty and estimate the effect of each of the

information, UQ and SA act as diagnostic tools to evaluate model fidelity and
compare model characteristics with expert knowledge and real world observation.
Computational efficiency is an important part of UQ and SA methods and thus
optimization is an active area of research. In this work, we investigate a new
efficient sampling method for least-squares polynomial approximation, weighted
approximate Fekete points (WAFP). We analyze the performance of this method by
demonstrating its utility in stochastic analysis of a cardiovascular model that
estimates changes in oxyhemoglobin saturation response. Polynomial chaos (PC)
expansion using WAFP produced results similar to the more standard Monte Carlo
in quantifying uncertainty and identifying the most influential model inputs
(including input interactions) when modeling oxyhemoglobin saturation, PC
expansion using WAFP was far more efficient. These findings show the usefulness
of using WAFP based PC expansion to quantify uncertainty and analyze
sensitivity of a oxyhemoglobin dissociation response model. Applying these
techniques could help analyze the fidelity of other relevant models in
preparation for clinical application.

determine the common metrics that can be used in the future to benchmark HMTs.
We have organized this review as follows: identification of metrics used in

This method has been proven effective in super-resolution, image de-noising,

due to the nature of MSE. MSE based methods minimize Euclidean distance for all
pixels between a baseline image and a generated image by CNN and ignore the
spatial information of the pixels such as image texture. In this paper, we
proposed a new method based on Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) for inverse problems. We
showed that the WGAN-based method was effective to preserve image texture. It
also used a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) regularizer to preserve pixel
fidelity. Maintaining image texture and pixel fidelity is the most important
requirement for medical imaging. We used Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) and
Structure Similarity (SSIM) to evaluate the proposed method quantitatively. We
also conducted first-order and second-order statistical image texture analysis
to assess image texture.

distributions, allowing for maximumlikelihood-based classification of new
classes without retraining the network. In this work, the authors observed
classification performance using maximum likelihood estimation of
CNNbootstrapped features to be comparable to that of a CNN trained on all
classes, even for those classes on which the bootstrapping CNN was not trained.
This performance was achieved while reducing the number of parameters needed
for new class definition from over 8 million to only 200. Furthermore, some
physical features of interest, not directly labeled during training, e.g.
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), can be learned or estimated from these same

e-commerce applications. While increasing research is dedicated to improving
the relevance and diversity of the recommendations, the potential risks of
state-of-the-art recommendation models are under-explored, that is, these
models could be subject to attacks from malicious third parties, through
injecting fake user interactions to achieve their purposes. This paper revisits
the adversarially-learned injection attack problem, where the injected fake
user `behaviors' are learned locally by the attackers with their own model --
one that is potentially different from the model under attack, but shares
similar properties to allow attack transfer. We found that most existing works
in literature suffer from two major limitations: (1) they do not solve the
optimization problem precisely, making the attack less harmful than it could
be, (2) they assume perfect knowledge for the attack, causing the lack of
understanding for realistic attack capabilities. We demonstrate that the exact
solution for generating fake users as an optimization problem could lead to a
much larger impact. Our experiments on a real-world dataset reveal important
properties of the attack, including attack transferability and its limitations.
These findings can inspire useful defensive methods against this possible
existing attack.

neural network (DNN) inference. Emergent DNN hardware accelerators begin to
support mixed precision (1-8 bits) to further improve the computation
efficiency, which raises a great challenge to find the optimal bitwidth for
each layer: it requires domain experts to explore the vast design space trading
off among accuracy, latency, energy, and model size, which is both
time-consuming and sub-optimal. Conventional quantization algorithm ignores the
different hardware architectures and quantizes all the layers in a uniform way.
In this paper, we introduce the Hardware-Aware Automated Quantization (HAQ)
framework which leverages the reinforcement learning to automatically determine
the quantization policy, and we take the hardware accelerator's feedback in the
design loop. Rather than relying on proxy signals such as FLOPs and model size,
we employ a hardware simulator to generate direct feedback signals (latency and
energy) to the RL agent. Compared with conventional methods, our framework is
fully automated and can specialize the quantization policy for different neural
network architectures and hardware architectures. Our framework effectively
reduced the latency by 1.4-1.95x and the energy consumption by 1.9x with
negligible loss of accuracy compared with the fixed bitwidth (8 bits)
quantization. Our framework reveals that the optimal policies on different
hardware architectures (i.e., edge and cloud architectures) under different
resource constraints (i.e., latency, energy, and model size) are drastically
different. We interpreted the implication of different quantization policies,
which offer insights for both neural network architecture design and hardware

critical points motivate schemes of quantum metrology that feature
sub-Heisenberg scaling of the sensitivity with the system size (e.g., the
number of particles). This sensitivity enhancement is fundamentally rooted in
the formation of Schr\""odinger cat states, or macroscopic superposition states
at the quantum critical points. The cat states, however, are fragile to
decoherence caused by local noises on individual particles or coupling to local
environments, since the local decoherence of any particle would cause the
collapse of the whole cat state. Therefore, it is unclear whether the
sub-Heisenberg scaling of quantum critical metrology is robust against the
local decoherence. Here we study the effects of local decoherence on the
quantum critical metrology, using a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising
model as a representative example. Based on a previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett.
94, 047201 (2005)] on the critical behaviors of the noisy Ising model, which
shows that the universality class of the quantum criticality is modified by the
decoherence, we find that the standard quantum limit is recovered by the
single-particle decoherence, which is equivalent to local quantum measurement
conducted by the environment and destroys the many-body entanglement in the
ground state at the quantum critical point. Following the renormalization group
analysis [Phys. Rev. B 69, 054426 (2004)], we argue that the noise effects on
quantum critical metrology should be universal. This works demonstrates the
importance of protecting macroscopic quantum coherence for quantum sensing
based on critical behaviors.

advantages versus creating project-specific infrastructure: (i) high
performance for short-iteration exploration and scalability to large data sets
(ii) easy distribution of extracted data(e.g., for replication) or sharing of

Semantic Clone Detection via Probabilistic Software Modeling (SCD-PSM) as a

Raman spectroscopy reveals negligible structural changes in the crystal quality
after the irradiation. These deformation damages due to proton irradiation are
insignificant at the MoS2 layer. Based on the overall influence of low energy
proton irradiation on the material characteristics, ML-MoS2 materials can be
considered robust and reliable building blocks for 2D material based devices

corrections appear moderate for $\chi_{c1}$ case, and insignificant for
$\chi_{c0}$. In addition, the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) predictions
for the production rates of $\chi_{c0,1}+\gamma$ are insensitive to the
renormalization and factorization scales. All of these features may indicate
that perturbative expansion in these two channels exhibits a decent convergence

are sizable, which even reduces the Born order cross section by one order of

the recent {\tt Belle} measurement. The NNLO predictions for the

Cicho\'n diagram for effective cardinal characteristics relativized to that
reduction. As an application I investigate in detail the Cicho\'n diagram for
degrees of constructibility relative to a fixed inner model of ZFC. Then I
study generalizations of cardinal characteristics to the space of functions
$f:\omega^\omega \to \omega^\omega$. I prove that these cardinals can be
organized into two diagrams analogous to the standard Cicho\'n diagram, prove
several independence results and investigate the relation between these
cardinals and the standard cardinal invariants on omega.
  In the second half of the thesis I look at forcing axioms compatible with CH.
First I consider Jensen's subcomplete and subproper forcing. I generalize these
notions to larger classes which are (apparently) much more nicely behaved
structurally. I prove iteration and preservation theorems for both classes and
use these to produce many new models of the subcomplete forcing axiom. Finally
I deal with dee-complete forcing and its associated axiom DCFA. Extending a
well-known result of Shelah, I show that if a tree of height $\omega_1$ with no
branch can be embedded into an $\omega_1$-tree, possibly with uncountable
branches, then it can be specialized without adding reals. As a consequence I
give a fleshed out proof that DCFA implies there are no Kurepa trees, even if
CH fails.

driven by Lyman-$\alpha$ photons from some of the earliest stars, producing a

to the large foreground, it is thought that around redshift 20 it is only
observationally feasible to detect 21-cm fluctuations statistically, yielding a
limited, indirect probe of early galaxies. Here we show that 21-cm images at

demonstrate this using a substantially upgraded semi-numerical simulation code

rarity of early galaxies, combined with the multiple scattering of photons in
the blue wing of the Lyman-$\alpha$ line, create the large bubbles and also
enhance the 21-cm power spectrum by a factor of 2--7 and add to it a feature

Photoionization modeling suggests that cold CGM gas has significantly lower

equilibrium with hot CGM gas. In this work, we investigate the impact of cosmic
ray physics on the formation of cold gas via thermal instability. We use
idealized three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to follow the
evolution of thermally unstable gas in a gravitationally stratified medium. We
find that cosmic ray pressure lowers the density and increases the size of cold
gas clouds formed through thermal instability. We develop a simple model for
how the cold cloud sizes and the relative densities of cold and hot gas depend
on cosmic ray pressure. Cosmic ray pressure can help counteract gravity to keep
cold gas in the CGM for longer, thereby increasing the predicted cold mass
fraction and decreasing the predicted cold gas inflow rates. Efficient cosmic
ray transport, by streaming or diffusion, redistributes cosmic ray pressure
from the cold gas to the background medium, resulting in cold gas properties
that are in-between those predicted by simulations with inefficient transport
and simulations without cosmic rays. We show that cosmic rays can significantly
reduce galactic accretion rates and resolve the tension between theoretical
models and observational constraints on the properties of cold CGM gas.

ff}$). We use integrated X-ray and thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich observations of
the environments around massive galaxies, galaxy groups and clusters, averaged
in halo mass bins, and obtain the best-fitting model parameters. We find
$t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff} \sim 50-110$, depending on the model extrapolation
beyond the halo virial radius and possibly on biases present in the data-sets
used in the fitting analysis. The model adequately describes the entire mass
range, except for intermediate mass halos ($M_{500} \sim 10^{13.5} M_{\odot}$)
which systematically fall below the model predictions. However, the best fits
for $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ substantially exceed the values typically derived
from X-ray observations of individual systems ($t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff} \sim
10-30$). We consider several explanations for those discrepancies, including
X-ray selection biases and a potential anti-correlation between X-ray
luminosity and the central galaxy's stellar mass.

AGNs with stronger outflows are hosted by galaxies with higher SFR. Compared to
star-forming galaxies in the main sequence, both type 1 and type 2 AGNs show
sSFR similar to that of non-AGN galaxies, indicating no instantaneous AGN

relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) using our GPU-accelerated code H-AMR. We
carry out the first grid-based simulation of a deep-penetration TDE ($\beta$=7)
with realistic system parameters: a black-hole-to-star mass ratio of $10^6$, a
parabolic stellar trajectory, and a nonzero BH spin. We also carry out a
simulation of a tilted TDE whose stellar orbit is inclined relative to the BH
midplane. We show that for our aligned TDE, an accretion disk forms due to the
dissipation of orbital energy with $\sim$20 percent of the infalling material
reaching the BH. The dissipation is initially dominated by violent
self-intersections and later by stream-disk interactions near the pericenter.
The self-intersections completely disrupt the incoming stream, resulting in
five distinct self-intersection events separated by approximately 12 hours and
a flaring in the accretion rate. We also find that the disk is eccentric with
mean eccentricity e$\approx$0.88. For our tilted TDE, we find only partial
self-intersections due to nodal precession near pericenter. Although these
partial intersections eject gas out of the orbital plane, an accretion disk
still forms with a similar accreted fraction of the material to the aligned
case. These results have important implications for disk formation in realistic
tidal disruptions. For instance, the periodicity in accretion rate induced by
the complete stream disruption may explain the flaring events from Swift
J1644+57.

a lower stellar metallicity (i.e., harder ionizing spectrum) but slightly
higher nebular metallicity and higher ionization parameter compared to the

higher $\alpha$/Fe) than the ""low"" population, both samples are significantly
more $\alpha$-enhanced compared to local star-forming galaxies with similar

the divergence of surface conditions for Venus and Earth remains an area of

climate history are orbital changes due to giant planet migration that have
both variable incident flux and tidal heating consequences. Here, we present
the results of a study that explores the effect of Jupiter's location on the
orbital parameters of Venus and subsequent potential water loss scenarios. Our
dynamical simulations show that various scenarios of Jovian migration could
have resulted in orbital eccentricities for Venus as high as 0.31. We quantify
the implications of the increased eccentricity, including tidal energy, surface
energy flux, and the variable insolation flux expected from the faint young
Sun. The tidal circularization timescale calculations demonstrate that a
relatively high tidal dissipation factor is required to reduce the eccentricity
of Venus to the present value, which implies a high initial water inventory. We
further estimate the consequences of high orbital eccentricity on water loss,
and estimate that the water loss rate may have increased by at least $\sim$5\%
compared with the circular orbit case as a result of orbital forcing. We argue
that these eccentricity variations for the young Venus may have accelerated the
atmospheric evolution of Venus towards the inevitable collapse of the
atmosphere into a runaway greenhouse state. The presence of giant planets in
exoplanetary systems may likewise increase the expected rate of Venus analogs
in those systems.

Quantum Mechanics, in which the Projection Postulate is replaced with a version
in which measurements and observations are not assumed as fundamental. More
precisely, the Wigner functions representing the quantum states on the phase
space are required to be tightly constrained to regions of the classical
coarse-graining of the phase space. This ensures that states are quasiclassical
at the macro level. Within a coarse-graining region, the time evolution of the
Wigner functions representing the quantum system is required to obey the
Liouville-von Neumann equation, the phase-space equivalent of the Schr\""odinger
equation. The projection is postulated to happen when the system transitions
from a coarse-graining region to others, by selecting one of them according to
the Born rule, but without reference to a measurements. The connection with the
standard formulation of Quantum Mechanics is explained, as well as the problems

correlators in conformal field theory. We call a sum rule dispersive if it has
double zeros at all double-twist operators above a fixed twist gap. Dispersive
sum rules have their conceptual origin in Lorentzian kinematics and absorptive
physics (the notion of double discontinuity). They have been discussed using
three seemingly different methods: analytic functionals dual to double-twist
operators, dispersion relations in position space, and dispersion relations in
Mellin space. We show that these three approaches can be mapped into one
another and lead to completely equivalent sum rules. A central idea of our
discussion is a fully nonperturbative expansion of the correlator as a sum over
Polyakov-Regge blocks. Unlike the usual OPE sum, the Polyakov-Regge expansion
utilizes the data of two separate channels, while having (term by term) good
Regge behavior in the third channel. We construct sum rules which are
non-negative above the double-twist gap; they have the physical interpretation
of a subtracted version of superconvergence sum rules. We expect dispersive sum
rules to be a very useful tool to study expansions around mean-field theory,
and to constrain the low-energy description of holographic CFTs with a large
gap. We give examples of the first kind of applications, notably, we exhibit a
candidate extremal functional for the spin-two gap problem.

IPD, we perform new analysis in terms of solar elongation angle ($\epsilon$),
because we expect zodiacal light (ZL) intensity from the isotropic IPD to
decrease as a function of $\epsilon$. We use the DIRBE weekly-averaged maps
covering $64^\circ \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 124^\circ$ and inspect the
$\epsilon$-dependence of residual intensity after subtracting conventional ZL
components. We find the $\epsilon$-dependence of the residuals, indicating the
presence of the isotropic IPD. However, the mid-IR $\epsilon$-dependence is
different from that of the isotropic IPD model at $\epsilon \gtrsim 90^\circ$,
where the residual intensity increases as a function of $\epsilon$. To explain
the observed $\epsilon$-dependence, we assume a spheroidal IPD cloud showing
higher density further away from the sun. We estimate intensity of the near-IR
extragalactic background light (EBL) by subtracting the spheroidal component,
assuming the spectral energy distribution from the residual brightness at
$12\,{\rm \mu m}$. The EBL intensity is derived as $45_{-8}^{+11}$,
$21_{-4}^{+3}$, and $15\pm3\,{\rm nWm^{-2}sr^{-1}}$ at $1.25$, $2.2$, and
$3.5\,{\rm \mu m}$, respectively. The EBL is still a few times larger than
integrated light of normal galaxies, suggesting existence of unaccounted
extragalactic sources.

light is a very challenging task in computer vision. Despite more than four
decades since the definition of the Photometric Stereo problem, most of the
literature has had limited success when global illumination effects such as
cast shadows, self-reflections and ambient light come into play, especially for
specular surfaces.
  Recent approaches have leveraged the power of deep learning in conjunction
with computer graphics in order to cope with the need of a vast number of
training data in order to invert the image irradiance equation and retrieve the
geometry of the object. However, rendering global illumination effects is a
slow process which can limit the amount of training data that can be generated.
  In this work we propose a novel pixel-wise training procedure for normal
prediction by replacing the training data (observation maps) of globally
rendered images with independent per-pixel generated data. We show that global
physical effects can be approximated on the observation map domain and this
simplifies and speeds up the data creation procedure.
  Our network, PX-NET, achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to
other pixelwise methods on synthetic datasets, as well as the Diligent real

the performance overhead and the additional complexity for this is often

tackles both challenges. We propose ""Software-Defined Data Protection"" (SDP),
an adoption of the ""Software-Defined Storage"" approach to non-performance
aspects: a trusted controller translates company and application-specific
policies to a set of rules deployed on the storage nodes. These, in turn, apply
the rules at line-rate but do not take any decisions on their own. Such an
approach decouples often changing policies from request-level enforcement and
allows storage nodes to implement the latter more efficiently.
  Even though in-storage processing brings challenges, mainly because it can
jeopardize line-rate processing, we argue that today's Smart Storage solutions
can already implement the required functionality, thanks to the separation of
concerns introduced by SDP. We highlight the challenges that remain, especially
that of trusting the storage nodes. These need to be tackled before we can
reach widespread adoption in cloud environments.

from WISE infrared colors. Both optically-selected and WISE-selected AGN have
L_sat values twice as high as non-active galaxy samples when controlling for
stellar mass and mean stellar age. This implies that the halos are twice as
massive, but we cannot rule out that the increase in L_sat is due to these AGN
residing in younger halos at the same mass. When only controlling for host
galaxy stellar mass, WISE-selected AGN also have higher L_sat values than
optical AGN at the factor of two level, consistent with previous results
comparing the clustering of obscured and unobscured AGN. However, controlling

galaxies. Here, we investigate the dynamical impact of a minor merger (mass
ratio 1:10) event on the final fate of a stellar bar in the merger remnant. To
achieve that, we choose a set of minor merger models from the publicly
available GalMer library of galaxy merger simulations. The models differ in
terms of their orbital energy, orientation of the orbital spin vector, and
morphology of the satellite galaxy (discy/spheroidal). We demonstrate that the
central stellar bar, initially present in the host galaxy, undergoes a
transient bar amplification phase after each pericentre passage of the
satellite; in concordance with past studies of bar excitation due to tidal
encounter. However, once the merger happens, the central stellar bar weakens
substantially in the post-merger remnants. The accumulation of satellite's
stars in the central region of merger remnant plays a key role in the bar
weakening process; causing a net increase in the central mass concentration as
well as in the specific angular momentum content. We find that the efficiency
of mass accumulation from the satellite in the central parts of merger remnants
depends on the orbital parameters as well as on the satellite's morphology.
Consequently, different minor merger models display different degrees of bar
weakening event. This demonstrates that minor merger of galaxies is a plausible
avenue for bar weakening in disc galaxies.

prevents the application of factorization methods known from leading power
resummation. Employing $d$-dimensional consistency relations from requiring
$1/\epsilon$ pole cancellations in dimensional regularization between momentum
regions, we show that the resummation of the off-diagonal parton-scattering
channels at the leading logarithmic order can be bootstrapped from the recently

we derive a result for the DGLAP kernel in terms of the series of Bernoulli

symmetry, in which the metric is mapped into itself under an inversion of the

generalisation, Couch and Torrence showed that the Kerr-Newman metric no longer
exhibits a conformal inversion symmetry, but the radial equation arising in the
separation of the massless Klein-Gordon equation admits a mode-dependent
inversion symmetry, where the radius of inversion depends upon the energy and
azimuthal angular momentum of the mode. It was more recently shown that the
static 4-charge extremal black holes of STU supergravity admit a generalisation
of the conformal inversion symmetry, in which the conformally-inverted metric
is a member of the same 4-charge black hole family but with transformed
charges. In this paper we study further generalisations of these inversion
symmetries, within the general class of extremal STU supergravity black holes.
For the rotating black holes, where again the massless Klein-Gordon equation is
separable, we show that examples with four electric charges exhibit a
generalisation of the Couch-Torrence symmetry of the radial equation. Now, as
in the conformal inversion of the static specialisations, the inversion of the
radial equation maps it to the radial equation for a rotating black hole with
transformed electric charges. We also study the inversion transformations for
the general case of extremal BPS STU black holes carrying eight charges (4

in the Mg II k-line profiles suggest material moved outwards in response to the

It appears that this extraordinary outflow of material from the star, likely

mismatch between the Hawking-Page transition and its avatar in $\mathcal{N}=4$

that would resolve the mismatch. Here we exhibit a phenomenon in complex matrix
models which we call ""delayed deconfinement"". It turns out that when the action
is complex, due to destructive interference, tachyonic modes do not necessarily
condense. We demonstrate this phenomenon in ordinary integrals, a simple

Delayed deconfinement implies a first-order transition, in contrast to the more
familiar cases of higher-order transitions in unitary matrix models. We
determine the deconfinement line and find remarkable agreement with the

thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, and gravity. Today, it is known that black
holes are thermodynamical objects with well-defined temperature and entropy.
Although black hole radiance gives us the mechanism from which we can associate
a well-defined temperature to the black hole, the origin of its entropy remains
a mystery. Here we investigate how the quantum fluctuations from the fields
that render the black hole its temperature contribute to its entropy. By using
the exact renormalization group equation for a self-interacting real scalar
field in a spacetime possessing a bifurcate Killing horizon, we find the
renormalization group flow of the total gravitational entropy. We show that
throughout the flow one can split the quantum field contribution to the entropy
into a part coming from the entanglement between field degrees of freedom
inside and outside the horizon and a part due to the quantum corrections to the
Wald entropy coming from the Noether charge. The renormalized black hole
entropy is shown to be constant throughout the flow while the balance between
the effective black hole entropy at low energies and the infra-red entanglement
entropy changes. A similar conclusion is valid for the Wald entropy part of the
total entropy. Additionally, our calculations show that there is no mismatch
between the renormalization of the coupling constants coming from the effective
action or the gravitational entropy, solving an apparent ""puzzle"" that appeared
to exist for interacting fields.

for circumstellar disks. Measuring the magnetic field morphology is difficult,
especially since polarimetric (sub)millimeter continuum observations may not
trace fields in most disks. The Goldreich-Kylafis (GK) effect suggests that
line polarization is perpendicular or parallel to the magnetic field direction.
We attempt to observe CO(2-1), $^{13}$CO(2-1), and C$^{18}$O(2-1) line
polarization toward HD 142527 and IM Lup, which are large, bright
protoplanetary disks. We use spatial averaging and spectral integration to
search for signals in both disks, and detect a potential CO(2-1) Stokes $Q$
signal toward both disks. The total CO(2-1) polarization fractions are 1.57
$\pm$ 0.18% and 1.01 $\pm$ 0.10% for HD 142527 and IM Lup, respectively. Our
Monte Carlo simulations indicate that these signals are marginal. We also stack
Stokes parameters based on the Keplerian rotation, but no signal was found.
Across the disk traced by dust of HD 142527, the 3$\sigma$ upper limits for
$P_{\text{frac}}$ at 0.5$^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim$80 au) resolution are
typically less than 3% for CO(2-1) and $^{13}$CO(2-1) and 4% for
C$^{18}$O(2-1). For IM Lup, the 3$\sigma$ upper limits for these three lines
are typically less than 3%, 4%, and 12%, respectively. Upper limits based on
our stacking technique are up to a factor of $\sim$10 lower, though stacking
areas can potentially average out small-scale polarization structure. We also
compare our continuum polarization at 1.3 mm to observations at 870 $\mu$m from
previous studies. The polarization in the northern dust trap of HD 142527 shows
a significant change in morphology and an increase in $P_{\text{frac}}$ as
compared to 870 $\mu$m. For IM Lup, the 1.3 mm polarization may be more
azimuthal and has a higher $P_{\text{frac}}$ than at 870 $\mu$m.

change. With the uptake of efficient technologies and increased
electrification, a better understanding of how potential changes in demand
patterns can affect network reliability is necessary. We quantify the
macro-economic impacts of potential future changes in demand profiles for an
electricity network undergoing generation shortages. Applied to Great Britain,
potential savings or losses are assessed for changes to peak demands under four
different load profiles: (i) current day, (ii) widespread uptake of efficient
appliances, (iii) deployment of heat pumps, and (iv) moving to an idealised
fully balanced load profile. Considerable variation in economic disruption is
observed both between different demand profiles and across Great Britain. When
the networks generation capacity is severely disrupted, we estimate hourly
macro-economic impacts to increase by up to {\pounds}1.23 million per
additional GW of national electricity demand. A similar reduction in impacts
can be achieved if peak demands are reduced by demand side management. We
conclude that risk-related economic impacts are directly linked to the temporal
pattern of energy demands and need to be included in the decision-making around
demand side measures. We find that decarbonisation strategies without
accompanying demand side management may lead to increased economic losses
without supply side interventions.

occurrence of an event when the system is in different states s of S define a
function from S to [0,1] called a numerical event or, more accurately, an
S-probability. Sets of S-probabilities ordered by the partial order of
functions give rise to so called algebras of S-probabilities, in particular to
the ones that are lattice-ordered. Among these there are the sigma-algebras
known from probability theory and the Hilbert-space logics which are important
in quantum-mechanics. Any algebra of S-probabilities can serve as a
quantum-logic, and it is of special interest when this logic turns out to be a
Boolean algebra because then the observed physical system will be classical.
Boolean algebras are in one-to-one correspondence to Boolean rings, and the
question arises to find an analogue correspondence for lattice-ordered algebras
of S-probabilities generalizing the correspondence between Boolean algebras and
Boolean rings. We answer this question by defining ring-like structures of
events (RLSEs). First, the structure of RLSEs is revealed and Boolean rings
among RLSEs are characterized. Then we establish how RLSEs correspond to
lattice-ordered algebras of numerical events. Further, functions for
associating lattice-ordered algebras of S-probabilities to RLSEs are studied.
It is shown that there are only two ways to assign lattice-ordered algebras of
S-probabilities to RLSEs if one restricts the corresponding mappings to term
functions over the underlying orthomodular lattice. These term functions are
the very functions by which also Boolean algebras can be assigned to Boolean
rings.

generalization of communication for omniscience (CO) [Csiszar and Narayan, IEEE

simultaneous decoder for the compression of correlated classical sources by

large number of starspot models and their resulting light curves to: 1) better
determine light curve metrics and methods that convey useful physical
information, 2) understand how the underlying degeneracies of the translation
from physical starspot distributions to the resulting light curves obscure that
information. We explore models of relatively active stars at several
inclinations while varying the number of (dark) spots, random spot
distributions in position and time, timescales of growth and decay, and
differential rotation. We examine the behavior of absolute and differential
variations of individual intensity dips and overall light curves, and
demonstrate how complex spot distributions and behaviors result in light curves
that typically exhibit only one or two dips per rotation. Unfortunately
simplistic ""one or two spot"" or ""active longitude"" descriptions or modeling of
light curves can often be highly misleading. We also show that short ""activity
cycles"" can easily be simply due to random processes.
  It turns out to be quite difficult to disentangle the competing effects of
spot lifetime and differential rotation, but under most circumstances spot
lifetime is the more influential of the two. Many of the techniques tried to
date only work when spots live for many rotations. These include
autocorrelation degradation for spot lifetimes and periodograms for both global
and differential rotation. Differential rotation may be nearly impossible to
accurately infer from light curves alone unless spots live for many rotations.
The Sun and solar-type stars its age or older are unfortunately the most
difficult type of case. Further work is needed to have increased confidence in
light curve inferences.

approaches is tangible in the literature (reviewing them separately and with
regards to the characteristics of studied problems), which can provide
pragmatic guidelines for practitioners and future research projects. This paper
aims to address this issue. Since different types of solution approaches
usually have different characteristics, this paper focuses only on
metaheuristic algorithms. Through both automatic and manual search methods, we
have selected and reviewed 28 papers with respect to their main problem and
solution approach features. Finally, some directions are introduced for future
research.

$a_2=\dots=a_d=0$. Only a handful of power series of finite order are
explicitly known through a formula for their coefficients. We argue in this
paper that it is advantageous to describe such series in closed computational
form through automata, based on effective versions of proofs of Christol's
theorem identifying algebraic and automatic series. Up to conjugation, there
are only finitely many series $\sigma$ of order $2^n$ with fixed break sequence
(i.e. the sequence of depths of $\sigma^{\circ 2^i}$). Starting from Witt
vector or Carlitz module constructions, we give an explicit automaton-theoretic
description of: (a) representatives up to conjugation for all series of order 4
with break sequence (1,m) for m<10; (b) representatives up to conjugation for
all series of order 8 with minimal break sequence (1,3,11); and (c) an
embedding of the Klein four-group into the Nottingham group at 2. We study the
complexity of the new examples from the algebro-geometric properties of the
equations they satisfy. For this, we generalise the theory of sparseness of
power series to a four-step hierarchy of complexity, for which we give both
Galois-theoretic and combinatorial descriptions. We identify where our
different series fit into this hierarchy. We construct sparse representatives
for the conjugacy class of elements of order two and depth $2^\mu \pm 1$ $(\mu
\geq 1)$. Series with small state complexity can end up high in the hierarchy.
This is true, for example, for a new automaton we found, representing a series
of order 4 with 5 states, the minimal possible number for such a series.

surroundings, yet there are many uncertainties in how extended defects form,
move, and interact deep beneath a material's surface. A newly developed imaging
diagnostic, dark-field X-ray microscopy (DFXM) can now visualize the behavior
of line defects, known as dislocations, in materials under varying conditions.
DFXM images visualize dislocations by imaging the very subtle long-range
distortions in the material's crystal lattice, which produce a characteristic
adjoined pair of bright and dark regions. Full analysis of how these
dislocations evolve can be used to refine material models, however, it requires
quantitative characterization of the statistics of their shape, position and
motion. In this paper, we present a semi-automated approach to effectively
isolate, track, and quantify the behavior of dislocations as composite objects.
This analysis drives the statistical characterization of the defects, to
include dislocation velocity and orientation in the crystal, for example, and
is demonstrated on DFXM images measuring the evolution of defects at 98$\%$ of
the melting temperature for single-crystal aluminum, collected at the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility.

moving in an otherwise quiescent infinite viscoelastic fluid under the

modelled by the Oldroyd-B equation, and the problem is solved for small
Weissenberg and Capillary numbers in terms of a double perturbation expansion.
  We assume microgravity conditions and neglect the convective transport of
energy and momentum. We derive expressions for the droplet migration speed and
its shape in terms of the properties of both fluids. In the absence of shape
deformation, the droplet speed decreases monotonically for sufficiently viscous
inner fluids, while for fluids with a smaller inner-to-outer viscosity ratio,
the droplet speed first increases and then decreases as a function of the
Weissenberg number. For small but finite values of the Capillary number, the
droplet speed behaves monotonically as a function of the applied temperature
gradient for a fixed ratio of the Capillary and Weissenberg numbers. We
demonstrate that this behaviour is related to the polymeric stresses deforming
the droplet in the direction of its migration, while the associated changes in
its speed are Newtonian in nature, being related to a change in the droplet's
hydrodynamic resistance and its internal temperature distribution. When
compared to the results of numerical simulations, our theory exhibits a good
predictive power for sufficiently small values of the Capillary and Weissenberg

is 'sandwiched' between two fully developed boundary layers from a turbulent
channel simulation. The film deforms and eventually ruptures within the shear
zone created by the co-flows. This efficient setup allows systematic variation
of physical parameters to gauge their role in the aerodynamically-driven
deformation and rupture of a liquid film under fully developed sheared

pressure field over the deforming film and related aerodynamic effects, as
previously suggested by other authors, in particular the role of the inviscid
lift and drag forces. A cumulative lift force is introduced to capture the
effect of the alternating pressure minima and maxima forming over the film
which amplify and eventually rupture the film. A velocity scale derived from
the lift-induced drag force reflects the state of the turbulent boundary layer
over the film and collapses the temporal development of this cumulative lift

higher and the power-law steeper in the Sy1B-Sy1Bw than in the Sy1N-Sy1Nw, 2)
V_max is higher in the Sy1Bw than in the Sy1Nw, correlated in both groups with

influences the optical properties of WSMs. For example, it was recently shown
that a complete optical valley polarization is achievable in a time-reversal
symmetric Weyl semimetal placed in a magnetic field\cite% {Bertrand2019}. This
effect originates from inter-Landau level transitions involving the chiral
Landau level and requires a tilt of the Weyl cones. In this paper, we show how
the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is modified in a WSM\ with tilted Weyl

the Voigt configuration, a large peak of the Kerr angle occurs at the plasmon

complicated by so-called matrix effects, which describe nonlinear changes in
the relative heights of emission lines as an unknown function of composition
due to atomic interactions within the LIBS plasma. In this work we explore the
use of the plasma physics code ATOMIC, developed at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, for the disaggregation task. ATOMIC has recently been used to model
LIBS spectra and can robustly reproduce matrix effects from first principles.
The ability of ATOMIC to predict LIBS spectra presents an exciting opportunity
to perform disaggregation in a manner not yet tried in the LIBS community,
namely via Bayesian model calibration. However, using it directly to solve our
inverse problem is computationally intractable due to the large parameter space
and the computation time required to produce a single output. Therefore we also
explore the use of emulators as a fast solution for this analysis. We discuss a
proof of concept Gaussian process emulator for disaggregating two-element
compounds of sodium and copper. The training and test datasets were simulated
with ATOMIC using a Latin hypercube design. After testing the performance of
the emulator, we successfully recover the composition of 25 test spectra with

solved using standard mixed-integer convex optimization methods at the cost of
very long solve times for some problem instances. We present a custom convex

greatly enhancing computational tractability. This method requires the solution

Monte Carlo approach. The analyses include death's data from USA, Brazil,
Mexico, UK, India and Russia, which comprise the four countries with the
highest number of deaths/confirmed cases, as of Aug 07, 2020, according to the
WHO. The Gompertz functions were fitted to the data of weekly averaged
confirmed deaths per day by mapping the $\chi^2$ values. The uncertainties,
variances and covariances of the model parameters were calculated by
propagation. The fitted functions for the average deaths per day for USA and
India have an upward trend, with the former having a higher growth rate and
quite huge uncertainties. For Mexico, UK and Russia, the fits are consistent
with a slope down pattern. For Brazil we found a subtle trend down, but with
significant uncertainties. The USA, UK and India data shown a first peak with a
higher growth rate when compared to the second one, demonstrating the benefits
of non-pharmaceutical interventions of sanitary measures and social distance
flattening the curve. For USA, a third peak seems quite plausible, most likely
related with the recent relaxation policies. Brazil's data are satisfactorily
described by two highly overlapped Gompertz functions with similar growth
rates, suggesting a two-steps process for the pandemic spreading. The 95% CI
for the total number of deaths ($\times 10^3$) predicted by the model for Aug
31, 2020 are 160 to 220, 110 to 130, 59 to 62, 46.6 to 47.3, 54 to 63 and 16.0
to 16.7 for USA, Brazil, Mexico, UK, India and Russia, respectively. Our
estimates for the prevalences of infections are in reasonable agreement with
some preliminary reports from serological studies carried out in USA and
Brazil. The method represents an effective framework to estimate the line-shape
of the infection curves and the uncertainties of the relevant parameters based
on the actual data.

(RL): learning $Q^\star$ from an exploratory and polynomial-sized dataset,
using a realizable and otherwise arbitrary function class. In fact, all
existing algorithms demand function-approximation assumptions stronger than
realizability, and the mounting negative evidence has led to a conjecture that
sample-efficient learning is impossible in this setting (Chen and Jiang, 2019).
Our algorithm, BVFT, breaks the hardness conjecture (albeit under a stronger
notion of exploratory data) via a tournament procedure that reduces the
learning problem to pairwise comparison, and solves the latter with the help of
a state-action partition constructed from the compared functions. We also
discuss how BVFT can be applied to model selection among other extensions and
open problems.

from one visual domain to another. Recent works assume that images descriptors
can be disentangled into a domain-invariant content representation and a
domain-specific style representation. Thus, translation models seek to preserve
the content of source images while changing the style to a target visual
domain. However, synthesizing new images is extremely challenging especially in
multi-domain translations, as the network has to compose content and style to
generate reliable and diverse images in multiple domains. In this paper we
propose the use of an image retrieval system to assist the image-to-image
translation task. First, we train an image-to-image translation model to map
images to multiple domains. Then, we train an image retrieval model using real
and generated images to find images similar to a query one in content but in a
different domain. Finally, we exploit the image retrieval system to fine-tune
the image-to-image translation model and generate higher quality images. Our
experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed solution and highlight the
contribution of the retrieval network, which can benefit from additional
unlabeled data and help image-to-image translation models in the presence of
scarce data.

an Earth-like CBP analog. We compare the differential evolution of an
Earth-like CBP's flux and surface temperature with that of an equivalent

habitability of the planet could vary. For a Sun-like primary, we find that the
flux variation over a single planetary orbit is greatest when the dynamical
mass ratio is ~0.3 for a G-K spectral binary. Using a latitudinal energy
balance model, we show that the ice-albedo feedback plays a substantial role in
Earth-like CBP habitability due to the interplay between flux redistribution
(via obliquity) and changes in the total flux (via binary gyration). We examine
the differential evolution of flux and surface temperature for Earth-like
analogs of the habitable zone CBPs (4 Kepler and 1 hypothetical system) and
find that these analogs are typically warmer than their ESS counterparts.

just how effective are face coverings? One means to address this question is to
review our understanding of the physical mechanisms by which masks and
coverings operate -- steric interception, inertial impaction, diffusion and
electrostatic capture. We enquire as to what extent these can be used to
predict the efficacy of coverings. We combine the predictions of the models of
these mechanisms which exist in the filtration literature and compare the
predictions with recent experiments and lattice Boltzmann simulations, and find
reasonable agreement with the former and good agreement with the latter.
Building on these results, we explore the parameter space for woven cotton

comparable filtration performance to surgical masks under ideal conditions.
Reusable cloth masks thus present an environmentally friendly alternative to
surgical masks so long as the face seal is adequate enough to minimise leakage.

governed purely byNewtonian gravity, making a clean testbed to determine what
halo properties drive its fate.Using machine learning, we predict the survival,
mass loss, final position, and merging time of subhalos within a cosmological
N-body simulation, focusing on what instantaneous initial features of the halo,
interaction, and environment matter most. Survival is well predicted, with our
model achieving 96.5% accuracy using only 3 model inputs from the initial
interaction.However, the mass loss, final location, and merging times are much
more stochastic processes, with significant margins of error between the true
and predicted quantities for much of our sample. The redshift, impact angle,
relative velocity, and the masses of the host and subhalo are the only relevant
initial inputs for determining subhalo evolution. In general, subhalos that
enter their hosts at a mid-range of redshifts (typically z = 0.67-0.43) are the
most challenging to make predictions for, across all of our final outcomes.
Subhalo orbits that come in more perpendicular to the host are also easier to
predict, except for in the case of predicting disruption, where the opposite
appears to be true. We conclude that the detailed evolution of individual
subhalos within N-body simulations is quite difficult to predict, pointing to a
stochasticity in the merging process. We discuss implications for both
simulations and observations

function is adaptive submodular and pointwise submodular. It is not clear
whether the same guarantee holds under adaptive submodularity (without
resorting to pointwise submodularity) or not. Our first contribution is to show
that the adaptive random greedy algorithm achieves a $1/e$ approximation ratio

algorithm is that it requires $O(n\times k)$ value oracle queries, where $n$ is
the size of the ground set and $k$ is the cardinality constraint. Our second
contribution is to develop the first linear-time algorithm for the non-monotone

$1/e-\epsilon$ approximation ratio (this bound is improved to $1-1/e-\epsilon$
for monotone case), using only $O(n\epsilon^{-2}\log \epsilon^{-1})$ value
oracle queries. Notably, $O(n\epsilon^{-2}\log \epsilon^{-1})$ is independent
of the cardinality constraint. For the monotone case, we propose a faster
algorithm that achieves a $1-1/e-\epsilon$ approximation ratio in expectation
with $O(n \log \frac{1}{\epsilon})$ value oracle queries. We also generalize
our study by considering a partition matroid constraint, and develop a
linear-time algorithm for monotone and fully adaptive submodular functions.

fundamental phenomenon. However, the spontaneous emission is generally masked

present paper, we have significantly advanced this study by exploring
additional aspects of the process we are interested in. We calculate the
positron energy spectra and find that these spectra can give a clear signature
of the transition from the subcritical to the supercritical regime. It is found
that focusing on a part of the positron spectrum, which accounts for the energy
region where the spontaneously created positrons can contribute, allows to get
a much stronger evidence of the transition to the supercritical mode, making it
very well pronounced in collisions, for example, of two uranium nuclei. The
possibility of extending this study to collisions of bare nuclei with neutral
atoms is also considered. The probability of a vacancy in the lowest-energy
state of a quasimolecule which is formed in collisions of a bare U nucleus with
neutral U and Cm atoms has been calculated. The relatively large values of this

of the models is adapted automatically to account for the amount of available

demonstrate the utility of the approach, we build models for the distribution

carbon deflagrations and transient carbon detonations at early times. As
turbulence becomes increasingly inhomogeneous, sustained carbon detonations are
initiated by the Zel'dovich reactivity gradient mechanism. The fuel is suitably
preconditioned by the action of compressive turbulent modes with wavelength
comparable to the size of resolved turbulent eddies; no acoustic wave is
involved in this process. Oxygen detonations are initiated either aided by
reactivity gradients or by collisions of carbon detonations. The observed
evolutionary timescales are found sufficiently short for the above process to
occur in the expanding, centrally ignited massive white dwarf. The
inhomogeneous conditions produced prior to DDT might be of consequence for the
chemical composition of the outer ejecta regions of SN Ia from the single

straightforward encodings that transform many-body Hamiltonians into qubit
Hamiltonians use $N$ of the available basis states of an $N$-qubit system,
whereas $2^N$ are in theory available. We explore an efficient encoding that
uses the entire set of basis states, where terms in the Hamiltonian are mapped
to qubit operators with a Hamiltonian that acts on the basis states in Gray

the ground state energy of a deuteron with a simulated variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE). It is compared to a standard ""one-hot"" encoding, and various
trade-offs that arise are analyzed. The energy distribution of VQE solutions
has smaller variance than the one obtained by the one-hot encoding even in the
presence of simulated hardware noise, despite an increase in the number of
measurements. The reduced number of qubits and a shorter-depth variational
ansatz enables the encoding of larger problems on current-generation machines.
This encoding also demonstrates improvements for simulating time evolution of
the same system, producing circuits for the evolution operators with reduced
depth and roughly half the number of gates compared to a one-hot encoding.

inherent in the nature of things and has increasingly become a focus of much
interest and investigation. Change can be modeled as a transition between two
states of a finite state machine (FSM). This change represents an exploratory
starting point in this paper. Accordingly, a sample FSM that models a car s
transmission system is re-expressed in terms of a new modeling methodology
called thinging machine (TM) modeling. Recasting the car-transmission model
involves developing (1) an S model that captures the static aspects, (2) a D
model that identifies states, and (3) a B model that specifies the behavior.
The analysis progresses as follows. - S represents an atemporal diagrammatic
description that embeds underlying compositions (static changes) from which the
roots of system behavior can be traced. - S is broken down into multiple
subsystems that correspond to static states (ordered constitutive components).
- Introducing time into static states converts these states into events, and
the behavior (B) model is constructed based on the chronology of these events.
The analysis shows that FSM states are static (atemporal) changes that
introduce temporal events as carriers of behavior. This result enhances the
semantics of the concepts of change, states, and events in modeling and shows
how to specify a system s behavior through its static description.

dimension is increased. These results are consistent with an increased forward
energy transfer at higher dimensions, further evidenced by measurements of a
larger asymptotic dissipation rate with growing dimension. The enstrophy

a maximum at around five dimensions and may reach zero in the limit of infinite

Navier-Stokes system and a turbulent mean stress model, that are similar to all

such appropriate handling, the evolution of a differentially rotating star and
the accretion rate of a disk are reassuringly insensitive to the choice of

Both temperature and emission measure start to rise much earlier than the
flare, along with an eruption and formation of a hot halo over the fan
structure. In the main flare phase, another set of ribbons forms inside the
circular ribbon, and expands as expected for ribbons at the footpoints of a
postflare arcade. An additional heating event further extends the decay phase,
which is also characteristic of some eruptive flares. The basic magnetic
configuration appears to be a fan-spine topology, rooted in a minority-polarity
patch surrounded by majority-polarity flux. We suggest that reconnection at the
null point begins well before the impulsive phase, when the null is distorted
into a breakout current sheet, and that both flare and breakout reconnection
are necessary in order to explain the subsequent local thermal evolution and
the eruptive activities in this confined magnetic structure. Using local DEMs,
we found a postflare temperature increase inside the fan surface, indicating
that the so-called EUV late phase is due to continued heating in the flare

Learned Proximal Convolutional Neural Network (LP-CNN) for solving the
ill-posed QSM dipole inversion problem in an iterative proximal gradient

take into account the physical model of dipole convolution. During training,
our LP-CNN learns an implicit regularizer via its proximal, enabling the
decoupling between the forward operator and the data-driven parameters in the
reconstruction algorithm. More importantly, this framework is believed to be
the first deep learning QSM approach that can naturally handle an arbitrary

physics, as demonstrated by a recent measurement of the neutrino-induced phase
shift in the BAO feature. In principle, these measurements offer a novel window
into physics at the time of baryon decoupling. However, our analytic
understanding of the BAO feature is limited, particularly for the range of
Fourier modes measured in surveys. As a result, it is unclear what the BAO
phase teaches us about the early universe beyond what is already known from the

effective interactions between the sterile neutrinos and the SM particles. In
this paper, we present an effective model based on one-particle-irreducible
interaction vertices at low energies that are induced from the SM gauge
symmetric four-fermion operators at high energies. The effective interaction
strength is constrained by the SM precision measurements, astrophysical and
cosmological observations. We introduce a novel effective electromagnetic
interaction between sterile neutrinos and SM neutrinos, which can successfully
explain the XENON1T event rate through inelastic scattering of the sterile
neutrino dark matter from Xenon electrons. We find that sterile neutrinos with
masses around $90$ keV and specific effective coupling can fit well with the
XENON1T data where the best fit points preserving DM constraints and possibly

credibility in high-stakes settings, it is important to ensure that these
explanations are accurate and reliable. However, prior work demonstrates that
explanations generated by state-of-the-art techniques are inconsistent,
unstable, and provide very little insight into their correctness and
reliability. In addition, these methods are also computationally inefficient,
and require significant hyper-parameter tuning. In this paper, we address the
aforementioned challenges by developing a novel Bayesian framework for
generating local explanations along with their associated uncertainty. We
instantiate this framework to obtain Bayesian versions of LIME and KernelSHAP
which output credible intervals for the feature importances, capturing the
associated uncertainty. The resulting explanations not only enable us to make
concrete inferences about their quality (e.g., there is a 95% chance that the
feature importance lies within the given range), but are also highly consistent
and stable. We carry out a detailed theoretical analysis that leverages the
aforementioned uncertainty to estimate how many perturbations to sample, and
how to sample for faster convergence. This work makes the first attempt at
addressing several critical issues with popular explanation methods in one
shot, thereby generating consistent, stable, and reliable explanations with
guarantees in a computationally efficient manner. Experimental evaluation with
multiple real world datasets and user studies demonstrate that the efficacy of

Alice and phase shifts at the IRS are jointly optimized to maximize the covert
transmission rate with either instantaneous or partial channel state

collaborative robots (ISCRs) that balance the conflicting demands of passive
safety dictating low torque actuation and the need to reach into deep confined
spaces. We consider the judicious use of bracing as a possible solution to
these conflicting demands and present a modeling framework that takes into
account the constrained kinematics and the effect of bracing on the
end-effector compliance. We then define a redundancy resolution framework that
minimizes the directional compliance of the end-effector while maximizing
end-effector dexterity. Kinematic simulation results show that the redundancy
resolution strategy successfully decreases compliance and improves kinematic
conditioning while satisfying the constraints imposed by the bracing task.
Applications of this modeling framework can support future research on the
choice of bracing locations and support the formation of an admittance control
framework for collaborative control of ISCRs under bracing constraints. Such
robots can benefit workers in the future by reducing the physiological burdens

settings. Previous studies focus on distant supervision under the assumption of
centralized training, which requires collecting texts from different platforms
and storing them on one machine. However, centralized training is challenged by
two issues, namely, data barriers and privacy protection, which make it almost
impossible or cost-prohibitive to centralize data from multiple platforms.
Therefore, it is worthy to investigate distant supervision in the federated
learning paradigm, which decouples the model training from the need for direct
access to the raw data. Overcoming label noise of distant supervision, however,
becomes more difficult in federated settings, since the sentences containing
the same entity pair may scatter around different platforms. In this paper, we
propose a federated denoising framework to suppress label noise in federated
settings. The core of this framework is a multiple instance learning based
denoising method that is able to select reliable instances via cross-platform
collaboration. Various experimental results on New York Times dataset and miRNA
gene regulation relation dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method.

are underestimated along the $K$ direction. Exchange coupling constants between
Fe atoms were refined by fits to the experimental magnon spectra, revealing
stronger nearest neighbor Fe1-Fe1 exchange coupling than previously reported.
The strength of this exchange coupling is almost an order of magnitude higher
than other exchange interactions despite the three-dimensional nature of the
phonon interactions. The lack of scattering intensity at energies above 60 meV
makes unconstrained determination of the full set of exchange interactions
difficult, which may be a fundamental challenge in metallic antiferromagnets.

sequences for fault-tolerant quantum error correction with the 16-qubit
extended Hamming code. Our scheme uses 10 syndrome bit measurements, compared
to 40 measurements with the Shor scheme. We design single-shot logical
measurements as well: any logical Z measurement can be made together with
fault-tolerant error correction using only 11 measurements. For comparison,
using the Shor scheme a basic implementation of such a non-destructive logical

repeated in parallel $t$ times is at most $t^{-\Omega(1)}$. Previously, only a
bound of $\approx \frac{1}{\alpha(t)}$, where $\alpha$ is the inverse Ackermann
function, was known.
  The GHZ game was recently identified by Dinur, Harsha, Venkat and Yuen as a
multi-player game where all existing techniques for proving strong bounds on
the value of the parallel repetition of the game fail. Indeed, to prove our
result we use a completely new proof technique. Dinur, Harsha, Venkat and Yuen
speculated that progress on bounding the value of the parallel repetition of
the GHZ game may lead to further progress on the general question of parallel
repetition of multi-player games. They suggested that the strong correlations
present in the GHZ question distribution represent the ""hardest instance"" of
the multi-player parallel repetition problem.
  Another motivation for studying the parallel repetition of the GHZ game comes
from the field of quantum information. The GHZ game, first introduced by
Greenberger, Horne and Zeilinger, is a central game in the study of quantum
entanglement and has been studied in numerous works. For example, it is used
for testing quantum entanglement and for device-independent quantum
cryptography. In such applications a game is typically repeated to reduce the
probability of error, and hence bounds on the value of the parallel repetition
of the game may be useful.

the SR (Max-SR), a general non-convex optimization problem is formulated with
the unit-modulus constraint of IRS phase-shift matrix (PSM), and the general

UMa-type eclipsing binary BF Pav are presented in this study. Light curves of
the system taken in BVRI filters from two observatories in Australia and
Argentina were modeled using the Wilson-Devinney code. The results of this
analysis demonstrate that BF Pav is a contact binary system with a photometric
mass ratio q=1.460+_0.014, a fillout factor f=12.5%, an inclination of
87.97+_0.45 deg and a cold spot on the secondary component. By using the
distance modulus formula, the distance of BF Pav was calculated to be d=268+_18
pc which is in good agreement with the Gaia EDR3 distance. We obtain an orbital
period increase at a rate of 0.142 s/century due to a quadratic trend in the
O-C diagram. Also, an alternative sudden period jump probably has occurred
which could be interpreted as a rapid mass transfer from the lower mass star to
its companion about DeltaM=2.45*10^(-6) Msun. Furthermore, there is an
oscillatory behavior with a period of 18.3+_0.3 yr. Since BF Pav does not seem
to have significant magnetic activity, this behavior could be interpreted as
the light-time effect caused by an undetected third body in this system. In
this case, the probability for the third body to be a low mass star with
M>=0.075 Msun or a brown dwarf is 5.4% and 94.6% respectively. If we assume
i'=90deg, a_3=8.04+_0.33 AU. The mass of the secondary component was also
determined using two different methods which result close to each other.

on Mean Shift clustering is proposed to solve the problems existing in the
traditional micro-trips method. Firstly, 1701 kinematic segments are obtained
by processing and dividing the driving data in real road conditions. Secondly,
12 kinematic parameters are calculated for each segment, and the dimensionality
of parameters is reduced through principal component analysis (PCA). Three
principal components are chosen to classify all cycles into three types by the
Mean Shift algorithm. Finally, according to the principle of minimum deviation,
representative micro-trips are selected from each type of cycle to complete the
construction of the final driving cycle. Further, the construction method in
this paper is compared with the micro-trips construction method by the K-Means
clustering. The results show that the construction method by Mean Shift
clustering can more effectively reflect the real driving data. This study
realizes the innovation in the construction method of micro-trips and provides
a preliminary theoretical basis for the formulation of automobile working
condition standards, energy management of new-energy vehicles, and optimal

measurements $y=Ax$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a sensing matrix,
arises from many applications. The orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) algorithm
is widely used for reconstructing $x$. A fundamental question in the
performance analysis of OMP is the characterizations of the probability of
exact recovery of $x$ for random matrix $A$ and the minimal $m$ to guarantee a
target recovery performance. In many practical applications, in addition to
sparsity, $x$ also has some additional properties. This paper shows that these
properties can be used to refine the answer to the above question. In this
paper, we first show that the prior information of the nonzero entries of $x$
can be used to provide an upper bound on $\|x\|_1^2/\|x\|_2^2$. Then, we use
this upper bound to develop a lower bound on the probability of exact recovery
of $x$ using OMP in $K$ iterations. Furthermore, we develop a lower bound on
the number of measurements $m$ to guarantee that the exact recovery probability
using $K$ iterations of OMP is no smaller than a given target probability.
Finally, we show that when $K=O(\sqrt{\ln n})$, as both $n$ and $K$ go to
infinity, for any $0<\zeta\leq 1/\sqrt{\pi}$, $m=2K\ln (n/\zeta)$ measurements
are sufficient to ensure that the probability of exact recovering any
$K$-sparse $x$ is no lower than $1-\zeta$ with $K$ iterations of OMP. For
$K$-sparse $\alpha$-strongly decaying signals and for $K$-sparse $x$ whose
nonzero entries independently and identically follow the Gaussian distribution,
the number of measurements sufficient for exact recovery with probability no
lower than $1-\zeta$ reduces further to
$m=(\sqrt{K}+4\sqrt{\frac{\alpha+1}{\alpha-1}\ln(n/\zeta)})^2$ and
asymptotically $m\approx 1.9K\ln (n/\zeta)$, respectively.

a car (with probability $p$) or by a vacant parking spot (with probability
$1-p$). Cars perform independent random walks and when they enter a vacant

occupied spots simply keep driving (continuing their random walk). It is known
that $p=1/2$ is a critical value in the sense that the origin is a.s. visited
by finitely many distinct cars when $p<1/2$, and by infinitely many distinct
cars when $p\geq 1/2$. Furthermore, any given car a.s. eventually parks for $p
\leq 1/2$ and with positive probability does not park for $p > 1/2$. We study
the subcritical phase and prove that the tail of the parking time $\tau$ of the

carbon emission, raising severe energy and environmental concerns. Therefore,
it is significant and urgent to develop novel smart building energy management
(SBEM) technologies for the advance of energy-efficient and green buildings.
However, it is a nontrivial task due to the following challenges. Firstly, it
is generally difficult to develop an explicit building thermal dynamics model
that is both accurate and efficient enough for building control. Secondly,
there are many uncertain system parameters (e.g., renewable generation output,
outdoor temperature, and the number of occupants). Thirdly, there are many
spatially and temporally coupled operational constraints. Fourthly, building
energy optimization problems can not be solved in real-time by traditional
methods when they have extremely large solution spaces. Fifthly, traditional
building energy management methods have respective applicable premises, which
means that they have low versatility when confronted with varying building
environments. With the rapid development of Internet of Things technology and
computation capability, artificial intelligence technology find its significant
competence in control and optimization. As a general artificial intelligence
technology, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is promising to address the above
challenges. Notably, the recent years have seen the surge of DRL for SBEM.
However, there lacks a systematic overview of different DRL methods for SBEM.
To fill the gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of DRL for SBEM
from the perspective of system scale. In particular, we identify the existing
unresolved issues and point out possible future research directions.

skyrmions persist over a wide temperature and magnetic field region as a
long-lived metastable state, and that the skyrmion lattice transforms from a
triangular lattice to a square one. To obtain perspective on chiral magnetism
in Co-Zn-Mn alloys and clarify how various properties related to the skyrmion
vary with the composition, we performed systematic studies on
Co$_{10}$Zn$_{10}$, Co$_9$Zn$_9$Mn$_2$, Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ and
Co$_7$Zn$_7$Mn$_6$ in terms of magnetic susceptibility and small-angle neutron
scattering measurements. The robust metastable skyrmions with extremely long
lifetime are commonly observed in all the compounds. On the other hand,
preferred orientation of a helimagnetic propagation vector and its temperature
dependence dramatically change upon varying the Mn concentration. The
robustness of the metastable skyrmions in these materials is attributed to
topological nature of the skyrmions as affected by structural and magnetic
disorder. Magnetocrystalline anisotropy as well as magnetic disorder due to the
frustrated Mn spins play crucial roles in giving rise to the observed change in
helical states and corresponding skyrmion lattice form.

period of less than 10 days show the non-stationary long-term variations of the
magnetic activity. The non-kinematic dynamo models take into account the
magnetic field feedback on the large-scale flow and heat transport inside the
convection zone. They show the non-monotonic variation of the dynamo period
with the rotation rate. The models for the rotational periods fewer than 10
days show the non-stationary evolution with a slight increase in the primary
dynamo period with the increase of the rotation rate. The non-kinematic models
show the growth of the dynamo generated magnetic flux with the increase of the
rotation rate. There is a dynamo saturation for the star rotating with a period
of two days and less. The saturation of the magnetic activity parameters is
accompanied by depression of the differential rotation.

fields. In order to enhance the angular resolution of light fields, view
synthesis methods can be utilized to generate dense intermediate views from
sparse light field input. Most successful view synthesis methods are
learning-based approaches which require a large amount of training data paired
with ground truth. However, collecting such large datasets for light fields is
challenging compared to natural images or videos. To tackle this problem, we
propose a self-supervised light field view synthesis framework with cycle
consistency. The proposed method aims to transfer prior knowledge learned from
high quality natural video datasets to the light field view synthesis task,
which reduces the need for labeled light field data. A cycle consistency
constraint is used to build bidirectional mapping enforcing the generated views
to be consistent with the input views. Derived from this key concept, two loss
functions, cycle loss and reconstruction loss, are used to fine-tune the
pre-trained model of a state-of-the-art video interpolation method. The
proposed method is evaluated on various datasets to validate its robustness,
and results show it not only achieves competitive performance compared to
supervised fine-tuning, but also outperforms state-of-the-art light field view
synthesis methods, especially when generating multiple intermediate views.
Besides, our generic light field view synthesis framework can be adopted to any
pre-trained model for advanced video interpolation.

only weakly upon the mass of progenitor stars. In the metallicity evolution,
the ratio of $^{56}$Fe (decayed by $^{56}$Ni) mass to the initial total gas

relies on fully treating any residual interference as noise, we consider a
novel multigroup multicast beamforming strategy based on RSMA. RSMA relies on
linearly precoded Rate-Splitting (RS) at the transmitter and Successive

to enable a flexible framework for non-orthogonal transmission and robust

locations in a complementary way. Particularly, two kinds of constraints are
proposed to prompt the consistency of object features within the same

leveraged to benefit its counterpart with inter-image communication. The second
constraint is to learn the global consistency of object features throughout the

global feature consistency by forcing the object features to approach
class-specific centers. The global centers are actively updated with the
training process. The two constraints can benefit each other to learn
consistent pixel-level features within the same categories, and finally improve
the quality of localization maps. We conduct extensive experiments on two

intensity, displaying a short hard spike, followed by a weaker, oscillatory
phase which exhibits the rotational period of the neutron star. If the magnetar
giant flares occur in nearby galaxies, they would appear as cosmic short-hard
gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) without detecting the weak oscillatory phase. Recently,
a short-hard GRB named GRB 200415A was detected, with a position coincident
with the Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), rasing the question whether it is a classic
short GRB or a magentar giant flare. Here we show that magnetar giant flares
follow a scaling relation between the spectral peak energy and the isotropic
energy in $1\,{\rm keV} - 10\,{\rm MeV}$, i.e., $E_{\rm p}\propto E_{\rm
iso}^{1/4}$, and locate in a distinct region of the $E_{\rm p}-E_{\rm iso}$
plane from that of classic short GRBs. The relation can be well understood in
the model that giant flares arise from the photosphere emissions of
relativistically expanding fireball. GRB 200415A, together with two other
candidate giant flares (GRB 051103 and GRB 070201) follow this relation, which
strongly favor the giant flare origin of these GRBs. The GeV emission detected
by \emph{Fermi}/LAT from GRB 200415A at $18-285 \,$s can also be explained in

dynamic scan and kinetic modeling protocols for efficient quantification of

duration were evaluated by using statistical fit quality, assessing the impact

results show that the kinetic model selection depends on the scan duration. The
reversible two-tissue model was needed for a one-hour dynamic scan. The
irreversible two-tissue model was optimal for a scan duration of around 10-15

was the most appropriate. For global quantification of myocardial glucose

potentially orders of magnitude faster in inference, as well as more power
efficient, than full-precision counterparts. However, 2 bits are required to
encode the ternary representation with only 3 quantization levels leveraged. As
a result, conventional TNNs have similar memory consumption and speed compared
with the standard 2-bit models, but have worse representational capability.
Moreover, there is still a significant gap in accuracy between TNNs and
full-precision networks, hampering their deployment to real applications. To
tackle these two challenges, in this work, we first show that, under some mild
constraints, computational complexity of the ternary inner product can be
reduced by a factor of 2. Second, to mitigate the performance gap, we
elaborately design an implementation-dependent ternary quantization algorithm.

are no near-linear time $2-\varepsilon$-approximation algorithms for the
Diameter of a sparse directed graph, even in unweighted graphs. This result
shows that a simple near-linear time 2-approximation algorithm for Diameter is
optimal under SETH, answering a question from a survey of Rubinstein and
Vassilevska-Williams (SIGACT '19) for the case of directed graphs.
  In the same survey, Rubinstein and Vassilevska-Williams also asked if it is
possible to show that there are no $2-\varepsilon$ approximation algorithms for
Diameter in a directed graph in $O(n^{1.499})$ time. We show that, assuming a
hypothesis called NSETH, one cannot use a deterministic SETH-based reduction to
rule out the existence of such algorithms.
  Extending the techniques in these two results, we characterize whether a
$2-\varepsilon$ approximation algorithm running in time $O(n^{1+\delta})$ for
the Diameter of a sparse directed unweighted graph can be ruled out by a
deterministic SETH-based reduction for every $\delta\in(0,1)$ and essentially
every $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, assuming NSETH. This settles the SETH-hardness of
approximating the diameter of sparse directed unweighted graphs for
deterministic reductions, up to NSETH. We make the same characterization for
randomized SETH-based reductions, assuming another hypothesis called NUNSETH.
  We prove additional hardness and non-reducibility results for undirected

Unfortunately, porosity is also detrimental to the thermoelectric power factor

strategies to recoup electrical performance in nanoporous Si by fine tuning the
carrier concentration and through judicious design of the pore size and shape
so as to provide energy selective electron filtering. In this study, we
considered phosphorus doped silicon containing discrete pores that are either
spheres, cylinders, cubes, or triangular prisms. The effects from these pores
are compared with those from extended pores with circular, square and
triangular cross sectional shape, and infinite length perpendicular to the
electrical current. A semiclassical Boltzmann transport equation is used to
model Si thermoelectric power factor. This model reveals three key results: The
largest enhancement in Seebeck coefficient occurs with cubic pores. The
fractional improvement is about 15% at low carrier concentration ($< 10^{20}\
\mathrm{1/cm^3}$) up to 60% at high carrier population with characteristic
length around $\sim 1\ \mathrm{nm}$. To obtain the best energy filtering effect
at room temperature, nanoporous Si needs to be doped to higher carrier
concentration than is optimal for bulk Si. Finally, in $n$-type Si
thermoelectrics the electron filtering effect that can be generated with
nanoscale porosity is significantly lower than the ideal filtering effect;
nevertheless, the enhancement in the Seebeck coefficient that can be obtained
is large enough to offset the reduction in electrical conductivity caused by
porosity.

Out of various compounds, XAgBi (X=Ba,Sr) turn out to be two ideal candidates,
in which the topological nodal point lie very close to the Fermi level, within

design geometric correspondences to reflect geometric matching and utilize a
triplet data structure to express users' perceptual preference of avatar

triplets for a system allowing users to easily and efficiently annotate the
correspondences. Using both geometric and perceptual correspondences, we
trained a network for expression domain translation from human to avatar.

This work analyzes the validity of the widely employed single-mode
approximation when describing the spin dynamics in response to a quench of the
system Hamiltonian. The single-mode approximation assumes that the different
hyperfine states all share the same time-independent spatial mode. This implies
that the resulting spin Hamiltonian only depends on the spin interaction
strength and not on the density interaction strength. Taking the spinor sodium
Bose-Einstein condensate in the $f=1$ hyperfine manifold as an example and
working within the mean-field theory framework, it is found numerically that
the single-mode approximation misses, in some parameter regimes, intricate
details of the spin and spatial dynamics. We develop a physical picture that
explains the observed phenomenon. Moreover, using that the population
oscillations described by the single-mode approximation enter into the
effective potential felt by the mean-field spinor, we derive a
semi-quantitative condition for when dynamical mean-field induced corrections
to the single-mode approximation are relevant. Our mean-field results have

non-relativistic WIMP-nucleus interaction allowed by Galilean invariance for a
WIMP of arbitrary spin $j_\chi$ in the approximation of one-nucleon currents.
Five nucleon currents arise from the nonrelativistic limit of the free nucleon
Dirac bilinears. Our procedure consists in (1) organizing the WIMP currents
according to the rank of the $2 j_\chi+1$ irreducible operator products of up
to $2 j_\chi$ WIMP spin vectors, and (2) coupling each of the WIMP currents to
each of the five nucleon currents. The transferred momentum $q$ appears to a
power fixed by rotational invariance. For a WIMP of spin $j_\chi$ we find a
basis of 4+20$j_\chi$ independent operators that exhaust all the possible
operators that drive elastic WIMP-nucleus scattering in the approximation of
one-nucleon currents. By comparing our operator basis, which is complete, to
the operators already introduced in the literature we show that some of the
latter for $j_\chi=1$ were not independent and some were missing. We provide
explicit formulas for the squared scattering amplitudes in terms of the nuclear
response functions, which are available in the literature for most of the
targets used in WIMP direct detection experiments.

strengthen his result and two results of Schoenberg [Ann. of Math. 1955]. One
of the latter results concerns zeros of Laplace transforms of multiply positive
functions. The other results study which powers $\alpha$ of two specific
kernels are totally non-negative of order $p\geq 2$ (denoted TN$_p$); both
authors showed this happens for $\alpha\geq p-2$, and Schoenberg proved that it
does not for $\alpha<p-2$. We show more strongly that for every $p \times p$
submatrix of either kernel, up to a 'shift', its $\alpha$th power is totally
positive of order $p$ (TP$_p$) for every $\alpha > p-2$, and is not TN$_p$ for
every non-integer $\alpha\in(0,p-2)$. In particular, these results reveal
'critical exponent' phenomena in total positivity. We also prove the converse
to a 1968 result of Karlin, revealing yet another critical exponent phenomenon
- for Laplace transforms of all Polya Frequency (PF) functions.
  We further classify the powers preserving all TN$_p$ Hankel kernels on
intervals, and isolate individual kernels encoding these powers. We then
transfer results on preservers by Polya-Szego (1925), Loewner/Horn (1969), and
Khare-Tao (in press), from positive matrices to Hankel TN$_p$ kernels. Another
application constructs individual matrices encoding the Loewner convex powers.
This complements Jain's results (2020) for Loewner positivity, which we
strengthen to total positivity. Remarkably, these (strengthened) results of
Jain, those of Schoenberg and Karlin, the latter's converse, and the above
Hankel kernels all arise from a single symmetric rank-two kernel and its
powers: $\max(1+xy,0)$.
  We also provide a novel characterization of PF functions and sequences of
order $p\geq 3$, following Schoenberg's 1951 result for $p=2$. We correct a
small gap in his paper, in the classification of discontinuous PF functions.

plays a significant role in safeguarding battery and its powered system. While
most current approaches are primarily based on data-driven methods, lacking
in-depth analysis of battery performance degradation mechanism may discount
their performances. To fill in the research gap about data-driven battery
performance degradation analysis, an invariant learning based method is
proposed to investigate whether the battery performance degradation follows a
fixed behavior. First, to unfold the hidden dynamics of cycling battery data,
measurements are reconstructed in phase subspace. Next, a novel multi-stage
division strategy is put forward to judge the existent of multiple degradation
behaviors. Then the whole aging procedure is sequentially divided into several
segments, among which cycling data with consistent degradation speed are
assigned in the same stage. Simulations on a well-know benchmark verify the
efficacy of the proposed multi-stages identification strategy. The proposed
method not only enables insights into degradation mechanism from data

tackle this issue, in this paper we present an automated mixed-precision

computational characteristics of MCU devices. Specifically, a Reinforcement
Learning agent searches for the best uniform quantization levels, among 2, 4, 8
bits, of individual weight and activation tensors, under the tight constraints
on RAM and FLASH embedded memory sizes. We conduct an experimental analysis on
MobileNetV1, MobileNetV2 and MNasNet models for Imagenet classification.
Concerning the quantization policy search, the RL agent selects quantization
policies that maximize the memory utilization. Given an MCU-class memory bound
of 2MB for weight-only quantization, the compressed models produced by the
mixed-precision engine result as accurate as the state-of-the-art solutions
quantized with a non-uniform function, which is not tailored for CPUs featuring
integer-only arithmetic. This denotes the viability of uniform quantization,
required for MCU deployments, for deep weights compression. When also limiting
the activation memory budget to 512kB, the best MobileNetV1 model scores up to
68.4% on Imagenet thanks to the found quantization policy, resulting to be 4%
more accurate than the other 8-bit networks fitting the same memory

understanding tasks. A typical challenge that hinders their real-world
applications is that unknown samples may be fed into the system during the
testing phase, but traditional deep neural networks will wrongly recognize
these unknown samples as one of the known classes. Open set recognition (OSR)
is a potential solution to overcome this problem, where the open set classifier
should have the flexibility to reject unknown samples and meanwhile maintain
high classification accuracy in known classes. Probabilistic generative models,
such as Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Adversarial Autoencoders (AAE), are
popular methods to detect unknowns, but they cannot provide discriminative
representations for known classification. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework, called Conditional Probabilistic Generative Models (CPGM), for open
set recognition. The core insight of our work is to add discriminative
information into the probabilistic generative models, such that the proposed
models can not only detect unknown samples but also classify known classes by
forcing different latent features to approximate conditional Gaussian
distributions. We discuss many model variants and provide comprehensive
experiments to study their characteristics. Experiment results on multiple
benchmark datasets reveal that the proposed method significantly outperforms
the baselines and achieves new state-of-the-art performance.

imposing non-uniform magnetic fields on each sites of $j-$th interstitial ionic

be enhanced to the maximal value 1 at a special fixed magnetic field. Moreover,
we find that the quantum Fisher information of the model with magnetic impurity
behaves considerably different from the original model. Besides of the quantum

binaries with a neutron star and a $0.4-3.3~M_{\odot}$ companion star in an

evolve into UCXBs, some of which will emit gravitational wave signals that can
be detectable by the LISA. However, the initial orbital periods of the binaries
that will evolve into UCXB-LISA sources in a distance of 10 kpc are located in
a very narrow range, i.e. the formation of these LISA source requires an
extremely fine-tuning of initial parameter. According to the characteristic
stains and the derived maximum detectable distances, four sources among eight
UCXBs with the observed distances are expected to be detected by the LISA.
Based on the parameter space given by the detailed binary evolution models and
the rapid binary star evolution code, the birthrate of UCXBs appearing as LISA

sizable magnetic moments at the lattice sites in the bulk region. Thus, the

effectively changed, which in turn change the topological phase. Within a
certain parameter regime, quasi-stable excited states of the zigzag nanoribbon

by designing massive strength and rigidity into the structure. Thermal

protective walls, and ground thermal disturbance was addressed by simply making
it tall. Seeing measurements were not a significant design consideration. The

independent relation classes cannot separate the visual features well. Although
some methods organize the visual features into graph structures and use message
passing to learn contextual information, they still suffer from drastic
intra-class variations and unbalanced data distributions. One important factor
is that they learn an unstructured output space that ignores the inherent
structures of scene graphs. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a Higher
Order Structure Embedded Network (HOSE-Net) to mitigate this issue. First, we
propose a novel structure-aware embedding-to-classifier(SEC) module to
incorporate both local and global structural information of relationships into
the output space. Specifically, a set of context embeddings are learned via
local graph based message passing and then mapped to a global structure based
classification space. Second, since learning too many context-specific
classification subspaces can suffer from data sparsity issues, we propose a
hierarchical semantic aggregation(HSA) module to reduces the number of
subspaces by introducing higher order structural information. HSA is also a
fast and flexible tool to automatically search a semantic object hierarchy

Although the existing particle annihilation via uniform mesh significantly

dramatically when D $\ge$ 6 due to the curse of dimensionality and consequently
makes the annihilation very inefficient.
  In this paper, we propose an adaptive particle annihilation algorithm, termed
Sequential-clustering Particle Annihilation via Discrepancy Estimation (SPADE),

Adaptive clustering of particles via controlling their number-theoretic
discrepancies and independent random matching in each group, and it may learn
the minimal amount of particles that can accurately capture the
non-classicality of the Wigner function. Combining SPADE with the variance

one is to maximize predictive accuracy and the other is to minimize costs of
the resulting model. These costs of individual features may be financial costs,
but can also refer to other aspects, like for example evaluation time. Feature
selection addresses both objectives, as it reduces the number of features and
can improve the generalization ability of the model. If costs differ between
features, the feature selection needs to trade-off the individual benefit and
cost of each feature. A popular trade-off choice is the ratio of both, the BCR
(benefit-cost ratio). In this paper we analyze implications of using this
measure with special focus to the ability to distinguish relevant features from
noise. We perform a simulation study for different cost and data settings and
obtain detection rates of relevant features and empirical distributions of the
trade-off ratio. Our simulation study exposed a clear impact of the cost
setting on the detection rate. In situations with large cost differences and
small effect sizes, the BCR missed relevant features and preferred cheap noise
features. We conclude that a trade-off between predictive performance and costs
without a controlling hyperparameter can easily overemphasize very cheap noise
features. While the simple benefit-cost ratio offers an easy solution to
incorporate costs, it is important to be aware of its risks. Avoiding costs
close to 0, rescaling large cost differences, or using a hyperparameter
trade-off are ways to counteract the adverse effects exposed in this paper.

Amesim, or Simscape, rely on Differential Algebraic Equations (DAE), i.e.,
constraints of the form f(dot{x},x,u)=0. This drastically facilitates modeling
from first principles of the physics and the reuse of models. In this paper we
develop the mathematical theory needed to establish the development of
compilers and tools for DAE based physical modeling languages on solid
mathematical bases. Unlike Ordinary Differential Equations, DAE exhibit subtle
issues because of the notion of differentiation index and related latent
equations -- ODE are DAE of index zero for which no latent equation needs to be
considered. Prior to generating execution code and calling solvers, the
compilation of such languages requires a nontrivial \emph{structural analysis}
step that reduces the differentiation index to a level acceptable by DAE
solvers. The models supported by tools of the Modelica class involve multiple
modes with mode-dependent DAE based dynamics and state-dependent mode
switching. Multimode DAE are much more difficult than DAE. The main difficulty
is the handling of the events of mode change. Unfortunately, the large
literature devoted to the mathematical analysis of DAEs does not cover the
multimode case, typically saying nothing about mode changes. This lack of
foundations causes numerous difficulties to the existing modeling tools. Some
models are well handled, others are not, with no clear boundary between the two
classes. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive mathematical approach
supporting compilation and code generation for this class of languages. Its
core is the structural analysis of multimode DAE systems. As a byproduct of
this structural analysis, we propose well sound criteria for accepting or
rejecting models. For our mathematical development, we rely on nonstandard
analysis, which allows us to cast hybrid systems dynamics to discrete time
dynamics with infinitesimal step size, thus providing a uniform framework for
handling both continuous dynamics and mode change events.

popular contents for wireless backhaul link traffic offloading. In
cache-enabling UAV NOMA networks, the caching placement of content caching
phase and radio resource allocation of content delivery phase are crucial for
network performance. To cope with the dynamic UAV locations and content
requests in practical scenarios, we formulate the long-term caching placement
and resource allocation optimization problem for content delivery delay
minimization as a Markov decision process (MDP). The UAV acts as an agent to
take actions for caching placement and resource allocation, which includes the
user scheduling of content requests and the power allocation of NOMA users. In
order to tackle the MDP, we propose a Q-learning based caching placement and
resource allocation algorithm, where the UAV learns and selects action with
\emph{soft ${\varepsilon}$-greedy} strategy to search for the optimal match
between actions and states. Since the action-state table size of Q-learning
grows with the number of states in the dynamic networks, we propose a function
approximation based algorithm with combination of stochastic gradient descent

information about the formation and evolution of planetary systems. However,
current post-processing techniques for high-contrast imaging using ground-based
telescopes have a limited sensitivity to extended signals and their morphology
is often plagued with strong morphological distortions. Moreover, it is
challenging to disentangle planetary signals from the disk when the two
components are close or intertwined. We propose a pipeline that is capable of
detecting a wide variety of disks and preserving their shapes and flux
distributions. By construction, our approach separates planets from disks.
After analyzing the distortions induced by the current angular differential
imaging (ADI) post-processing techniques, we establish a direct model of the
different components constituting a temporal sequence of high-contrast images.
In an inverse problem framework, we jointly estimate the starlight residuals
and the potential extended sources and point sources hidden in the images,
using low-complexity priors for each signal. To verify and estimate the
performance of our approach, we tested it on VLT/SPHERE-IRDIS data, in which we
injected synthetic disks and planets. We also applied our approach on
observations containing real disks. Our technique makes it possible to detect
disks from ADI datasets of a contrast above $3\times10^{-6}$ with respect to
the host star. As no specific shape of the disks is assumed, we are capable of
extracting a wide diversity of disks, including face-on disks. The intensity
distribution of the detected disk is accurately preserved and point sources are
distinguished, even close to the disk.

Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM), also simply referred to as k-medoids
clustering. In Euclidean geometry the mean-as used in k-means-is a good
estimator for the cluster center, but this does not exist for arbitrary
dissimilarities. PAM uses the medoid instead, the object with the smallest
dissimilarity to all others in the cluster. This notion of centrality can be
used with any (dis-)similarity, and thus is of high relevance to many domains
and applications. A key issue with PAM is its high run time cost. We propose
modifications to the PAM algorithm that achieve an O(k)-fold speedup in the
second (""SWAP"") phase of the algorithm, but will still find the same results as
the original PAM algorithm. If we relax the choice of swaps performed (while
retaining comparable quality), we can further accelerate the algorithm by
eagerly performing additional swaps in each iteration. With the substantially
faster SWAP, we can now explore faster initialization strategies, because (i)
the classic (""BUILD"") initialization now becomes the bottleneck, and (ii) our
swap is fast enough to compensate for worse starting conditions. We also show
how the CLARA and CLARANS algorithms benefit from the proposed modifications.
While we do not study the parallelization of our approach in this work, it can
easily be combined with earlier approaches to use PAM and CLARA on big data
(some of which use PAM as a subroutine, hence can immediately benefit from
these improvements), where the performance with high k becomes increasingly
important. In experiments on real data with k=100,200, we observed a 458x
respectively 1191x speedup compared to the original PAM SWAP algorithm, making
PAM applicable to larger data sets, and in particular to higher k.

equations from the Boltzmann equation for inelastic hard spheres with small
inelasticity. The hydrodynamic system that we obtain is an incompressible
Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with self-consistent forcing terms and is thus the
first hydrodynamic system that properly describes rapid granular flows. To do
that, we write our Boltzmann equation in nondimensional form introducing the
dimensionless Knudsen number which is intended to tend to 0. The difficulties
are then manyfold, the first one coming from the fact that the original
Boltzmann equation is free-cooling and thus requires a self-similar change of
variables to work with an equation that has an homogeneous steady state. The
latter is not explicit and is heavy-tailed, which is a major obstacle to adapt
energy estimates and spectral analysis. One of the main challenges here is to
understand the relation between the restitution coefficient (which quantifies
the loss of energy at the microscopic level) and the Knudsen number. This is
done identifying the correct nearly elastic regime to capture nontrivial
hydrodynamic behavior. We are then able to prove exponential stability
uniformly with respect to the Knudsen number of the solution of our rescaled
Boltzmann equation in a close to equilibrium regime. Finally, we prove that our
solution to the Boltzmann equation converges in some very specific weak sense
towards some hydrodynamic solution which depends on time and space variables
only through macroscopic quantities. Such macroscopic quantities are solutions
to a suitable modification of the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system

existing approaches typically ignore inter-aspect relations or rely on temporal
dependencies to process aspect-aware representations of all aspects in a
sentence. Although multiple aspects of a sentence appear in a non-adjacent
sequential order, they are not in a strict temporal relationship as natural
language sequence, thus the aspect-aware sentence representations should not be
treated as temporal dependency processing. In this paper, we propose a novel
non-temporal mechanism to enhance the ABSA task through modeling inter-aspect
dependencies. Furthermore, we focus on the well-known class imbalance issue on
the ABSA task and address it by down-weighting the loss assigned to
well-classified instances. Experiments on two distinct domains of SemEval 2014

  Using Increasing Transformations",,,,,"cs.DS cs.AI cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Given a vertex-weighted graph, the maximum weight independent set problem
asks for a pair-wise non-adjacent set of vertices such that the sum of their
weights is maximum. The branch-and-reduce paradigm is the de facto standard
approach to solve the problem to optimality in practice. In this paradigm, data
reduction rules are applied to decrease the problem size. These data reduction
rules ensure that given an optimum solution on the new (smaller) input, one can
quickly construct an optimum solution on the original input.
  We introduce new generalized data reduction and transformation rules for the
problem. A key feature of our work is that some transformation rules can
increase the size of the input. Surprisingly, these so-called increasing
transformations can simplify the problem and also open up the reduction space
to yield even smaller irreducible graphs later throughout the algorithm. In
experiments, our algorithm computes significantly smaller irreducible graphs on
all except one instance, solves more instances to optimality than previously
possible, is up to two orders of magnitude faster than the best
state-of-the-art solver, and finds higher-quality solutions than heuristic
solvers DynWVC and HILS on many instances. While the increasing transformations
are only efficient enough for preprocessing at this time, we see this as a
critical initial step towards a new branch-and-transform paradigm.

In such a situation, recording and replaying test scripts is a popular
automated mobile app testing approaches. But such approach encounters severe
problems when crossing platforms. Different versions of the same app need to be
developed to support different platforms relying on different platform
supports. Therefore, mobile app developers need to develop and maintain test
scripts for multiple platforms aimed at completely the same test requirements,
greatly increasing testing costs. However, we discover that developers adopt
highly similar user interface layouts for versions of the same app on different
platforms. Such a phenomenon inspires us to replay test scripts from the
perspective of similar UI layouts. We propose an image-driven mobile app
testing framework, utilizing Widget Feature Matching and Layout
Characterization Matching. We use computer vision technologies to perform UI
feature comparison and layout hierarchy extraction on app screenshots to obtain
UI structures with rich contextual information, including coordinates, relative
relationship, etc. Based on acquired UI structures, we can form a
platform-independent test script, and then locate the target widgets under

according to a novel platform-independent test script model. We also design and
implement a tool named LIT to devote the proposed framework into practice,
based on which, we conduct an empirical study to evaluate the effectiveness and
usability of the proposed testing framework. Results show that the overall
replay accuracy reaches around 63.39% on Android (14% improvement over

spin, a black hole mass and an ambient pressure amplitude, using the observed
jet shape break position and the jet width at the transition point for 11

learning, there has been a significant recent interest in the concept of
federated learning. Federated learning offers on-device, privacy-preserving
machine learning without the need to transfer end-devices data to a third party
location. However, federated learning still has privacy concerns due to
sensitive information inferring capability of the aggregation server using
end-devices local learning models. Furthermore, the federated learning process
might fail due to a failure in the aggregation server (e.g., due to a malicious
attack or physical defect). Other than privacy and robustness issues, federated
learning over IoT networks requires a significant amount of communication
resources for training. To cope with these issues, we propose a novel concept
of dispersed federated learning (DFL) that is based on the true
decentralization. We opine that DFL will serve as a practical implementation of
federated learning for various IoT-based smart applications such as smart
industries and intelligent transportation systems. First, the fundamentals of
the DFL are presented. Second, a taxonomy is devised with a qualitative
analysis of various DFL schemes. Third, a DFL framework for IoT networks is

research directions is presented.

last decade, the~strict traditional notion of reversibility that led to

finite-period planning horizon, given that the firm may not know the underlying
demand curve ""a priori"". In emerging markets, in particular, firms constantly
adjust pricing strategies to collect adequate demand information, which is a
process known as price experimentation. To date, few papers have investigated
the pricing decision process in a competitive environment with unknown demand
curves, conditions that make analysis more complex. Asynchronous price updating
can render the demand information gathered by price experimentation less
informative or inaccurate, as it is nearly impossible for firms to remain
informed about the latest prices set by competitors. Hence, firms may set
prices using available, yet out-of-date, price information of competitors.
  In this paper, we design an algorithm to facilitate synchronized dynamic
pricing, in which competitive firms estimate their demand functions based on
observations and adjust their pricing strategies in a prescribed manner. The
process is called ""learning and earning"" elsewhere in the literature. The goal
is for the pricing decisions, determined by estimated demand functions, to
converge to underlying equilibrium decisions. The main question that we answer
is whether such a mechanism of periodically synchronized price updates is
optimal for all firms. Furthermore, we ask whether prices converge to a stable
state and how much regret firms incur by employing such a data-driven pricing
algorithm.

the emotion labels for these in-the-wild facial expressions cannot easily be

we develop a RAF-AU database that employs a sign-based (i.e., AUs) and
judgement-based (i.e., perceived emotion) approach to annotating blended facial
expressions in the wild. We first reviewed the annotation methods in existing
databases and identified crowdsourcing as a promising strategy for labeling
in-the-wild facial expressions. Then, RAF-AU was finely annotated by
experienced coders, on which we also conducted a preliminary investigation of
which key AUs contribute most to a perceived emotion, and the relationship

proves that quantum effects can appear without an external drive. Such SSC
could become a resource to demonstrate quantum advantage in the applications.
We predict the generation of SSC if the target system repeatedly interacts with
independent and non-correlated bath elements. To describe their behavior, we
use the collision model approach of system-bath interaction, where the system
interacts with one bath element (initially in an incoherent state) at a time,
asymptotically (in the fast-collision regime) mimicking a macroscopic Markovian
bath coupled to the target system. Therefore, the SSC qualitatively appears to
be the same as if the continuous Markovian bath would be used. We confirm that
the presence of composite system-bath interactions under the rotating-wave
approximation (RWA) is the necessary condition for the generation of SSC using
thermal resources in collision models. Remarkably, we show that SSC
substantially increases if the target system interacts collectively with more
than one bath element at a time. Already few bath elements collectively
interacting with the target system are sufficient to increase SSC at non-zero
temperatures at the cost of tolerable lowering the final state purity. From the
thermodynamic perspective, the SSC generation in our collision models is
inevitably linked to a non zero power input (and thus heat dissipated to the
bath) necessary to reach the steady-state, although such energetic cost can be
lower compared to cases relying on SSC non generating interactions.

which constitute a multiplex social network. It is becoming increasingly
challenging to determine whether given accounts on different SMNs belong to the
same user; this can be expressed as an interlayer link prediction problem in a
multiplex network. To address the challenge of predicting interlayer links ,
feature or structure information is leveraged. Existing methods that use
network embedding techniques to address this problem focus on learning a
mapping function to unify all nodes into a common latent representation space
for prediction; positional relationships between unmatched nodes and their
common matched neighbors (CMNs) are not utilized. Furthermore, the layers are
often modeled as unweighted graphs, ignoring the strengths of the relationships
between nodes. To address these limitations, we propose a framework based on
multiple types of consistency between embedding vectors (MulCEV). In MulCEV,
the traditional embedding-based method is applied to obtain the degree of
consistency between the vectors representing the unmatched nodes, and a
proposed distance consistency index based on the positions of nodes in each
latent space provides additional clues for prediction. By associating these two
types of consistency, the effective information in the latent spaces is fully
utilized. Additionally, MulCEV models the layers as weighted graphs to obtain
representation. In this way, the higher the strength of the relationship
between nodes, the more similar their embedding vectors in the latent
representation space will be. The results of our experiments on several
real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed MulCEV framework markedly
outperforms current embedding-based methods, especially when the number of
training iterations is small.

among agents induce a certain outcome (i.e., success or failure). Earlier
studies have tried to resolve this issue by employing an intrinsic reward to
induce interactions that are helpful for learning an effective policy. However,
this approach requires extensive prior knowledge for designing an intrinsic
reward. To train the MARL model effectively without designing the intrinsic
reward, we propose a learning-based exploration strategy to generate the
initial states of a game. The proposed method adopts a variational graph
autoencoder to represent a game state such that (1) the state can be compactly
encoded to a latent representation by considering relationships among agents,
and (2) the latent representation can be used as an effective input for a
coupled surrogate model to predict an exploration score. The proposed method
then finds new latent representations that maximize the exploration scores and
decodes these representations to generate initial states from which the MARL
model starts training in the game and thus experiences novel and rewardable
states. We demonstrate that our method improves the training and performance of
the MARL model more than the existing exploration methods.

enables models to obtain 6.9% performance gain on the average metrics. With
even a smaller number of parameters, less training data, and shorter training

vulnerability of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) against adversarial attacks.
Typical DNN classifiers encode the input image into a compressed latent
representation more suitable for inference. This information bottleneck makes a
trade-off between the image-specific structure and class-specific information
in an image. By reinforcing the former while maintaining the latter, any
redundant information, be it adversarial or not, should be removed from the
latent representation. Hence, this paper proposes to jointly train an
auto-encoder (AE) sharing the same encoding weights with the visual classifier.
In order to reinforce the information bottleneck, we introduce the multi-scale
low-pass objective and multi-scale high-frequency communication for better
frequency steering in the network. Unlike existing approaches, our scheme is
the first reforming defense per se which keeps the classifier structure
untouched without appending any pre-processing head and is trained with clean
images only. Extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet demonstrate

we tackle the task of cross-modal retrieval through image-sentence matching
based on word-region alignments, using supervision only at the global
image-sentence level. Specifically, we present a novel approach called
Transformer Encoder Reasoning and Alignment Network (TERAN). TERAN enforces a
fine-grained match between the underlying components of images and sentences,
i.e., image regions and words, respectively, in order to preserve the
informative richness of both modalities. TERAN obtains state-of-the-art results
on the image retrieval task on both MS-COCO and Flickr30k datasets. Moreover,
on MS-COCO, it also outperforms current approaches on the sentence retrieval
task.
  Focusing on scalable cross-modal information retrieval, TERAN is designed to
keep the visual and textual data pipelines well separated. Cross-attention
links invalidate any chance to separately extract visual and textual features
needed for the online search and the offline indexing steps in large-scale
retrieval systems. In this respect, TERAN merges the information from the two
domains only during the final alignment phase, immediately before the loss
computation. We argue that the fine-grained alignments produced by TERAN pave
the way towards the research for effective and efficient methods for
large-scale cross-modal information retrieval. We compare the effectiveness of
our approach against relevant state-of-the-art methods. On the MS-COCO 1K test
set, we obtain an improvement of 5.7% and 3.5% respectively on the image and
the sentence retrieval tasks on the Recall@1 metric. The code used for the

Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) dipole picture total cross sections have become

subtracts the soft gluon divergence present at NLO. We report our recently

infeasible due to the exponential scaling of the number of required
measurements on the number of qubits in the system. However, several ideas were
proposed recently for predicting the limited number of features for these
states, or estimating the expectation values of operators, without the need for
full state reconstruction. These ideas go under the general name of shadow
tomography. Here we provide an experimental demonstration of property
estimation based on classical shadows proposed in [H.-Y. Huang, R. Kueng, J.

in the context of finite, but small, strain theory. The research is focused on
the introduction of the full shell metric and examination of its influence on
the nonlinear structural response. The exact relation between the reference and
equidistant strains is employed and the complete analytic elastic constitutive
relation between energetically conjugated forces and strains is derived via the
reciprocal shift tensor. Utilizing these strict relations, the geometric
stiffness matrix is derived explicitly by the variation of the unknown metric.
Moreover, a compact form of this matrix is presented. Despite the linear
displacement distribution due to the Kirchhoff-Love hypothesis, a nonlinear
strain distribution arises along the shell thickness. This fact is sometimes
disregarded for the nonlinear analysis of thin shells based on the initial
geometry, thereby ignoring the strong curviness of a shell at some subsequent
configuration. We show that the curviness of a shell at each configuration
determines the appropriate shell formulation. For shells that become strongly
curved at some configurations during deformation, the nonlinear distribution of
strain throughout the thickness must be considered in order to obtain accurate
results. We investigate four computational models: one based on the full
analytical constitutive relation, and three simplified ones. Robustness,
efficiency and accuracy of the presented formulation are examined via selected
numerical experiments. Our main finding is that the employment of the full
metric is often required when the complete response of the shells is sought,

the best balance between efficiency and accuracy is suggested for the nonlinear

  Conference on Multimedia (ACM MM'20), Seattle, WA, USA",,,,"cs.CV cs.DC cs.MM cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the development of deep learning technologies, attribute recognition and
person re-identification (re-ID) have attracted extensive attention and
achieved continuous improvement via executing computing-intensive deep neural
networks in cloud datacenters. However, the datacenter deployment cannot meet
the real-time requirement of attribute recognition and person re-ID, due to the
prohibitive delay of backhaul networks and large data transmissions from
cameras to datacenters. A feasible solution thus is to employ mobile edge
clouds (MEC) within the proximity of cameras and enable distributed inference.
In this paper, we design novel models for pedestrian attribute recognition with
re-ID in an MEC-enabled camera monitoring system. We also investigate the
problem of distributed inference in the MEC-enabled camera network. To this
end, we first propose a novel inference framework with a set of distributed
modules, by jointly considering the attribute recognition and person re-ID. We
then devise a learning-based algorithm for the distributions of the modules of
the proposed distributed inference framework, considering the dynamic
MEC-enabled camera network with uncertainties. We finally evaluate the
performance of the proposed algorithm by both simulations with real datasets
and system implementation in a real testbed. Evaluation results show that the
performance of the proposed algorithm with distributed inference framework is
promising, by reaching the accuracies of attribute recognition and person
identification up to 92.9% and 96.6% respectively, and significantly reducing
the inference delay by at least 40.6% compared with existing methods.

pixel-wise SSL approaches are only suitable for certain tasks as they usually
require to use task-specific properties. In this paper, we present a new SSL
framework, named Guided Collaborative Training (GCT), for pixel-wise tasks,
with two main technical contributions. First, GCT addresses the issues caused
by the dense outputs through a novel flaw detector. Second, the modules in GCT
learn from unlabeled data collaboratively through two newly proposed
constraints that are independent of task-specific properties. As a result, GCT
can be applied to a wide range of pixel-wise tasks without structural
adaptation. Our extensive experiments on four challenging vision tasks,

automata, a form of computational structure. The basis for transitions in our
automata are plausible RNA enzymes that may perform ligation or cleavage.
Limited to these operations, we construct RNA automata of increasing
complexity; from the Finite Automaton (RNA-FA) to the Turing Machine equivalent
2-stack PDA (RNA-2PDA) and the universal RNA-UPDA. For each automaton we show
how the enzymatic reactions match the logical operations of the RNA automaton.
A critical theme of the Ansatz is the self-reference in RNA automata
configurations which exploits the program-data duality but results in
computational undecidability. We describe how computational undecidability is
exemplified in the self-referential Liar paradox that places a boundary on a
logical system, and by construction, any RNA automata. We argue that an
expansion of the evolutionary space for RNA-2PDA automata can be interpreted as
a hierarchical resolution of computational undecidability by a meta-system
(akin to Turing's oracle), in a continual process analogous to Turing's ordinal
logics and Post's extensible recursively generated logics. On this basis, we
put forward the hypothesis that the resolution of undecidable configurations in
RNA automata represent a novelty generation mechanism and propose avenues for
future investigation of biological automata.

of three different graphene double bilayers: double bilayers composed of two AB
stacked bilayers (AB/AB), double bilayers composed of two AA stacked bilayers
(AA/AA) as well as heterosystems composed of one AB and one AA bilayer (AB/AA).
The atomic structure is determined using classical force fields. We find that
the inner layers of the double bilayer exhibit significant in-plane and
out-of-plane relaxations, similar to twisted bilayer graphene. The relaxations
of the outer layers depend on the stacking: atoms in AB bilayers follow the
relaxations of the inner layers, while atoms in AA bilayers attempt to avoid
higher-energy AA stacking. For the relaxed structures, we calculate the
electronic band structures using the tight-binding method. All double bilayers
exhibit flat bands at small twist angles, but the shape of the bands depends
sensitively on the stacking of the outer layers. To gain further insight, we
study the evolution of the band structure as the outer layers are rigidly moved
away from the inner layers, while preserving their atomic relaxations. This
reveals that the hybridization with the outer layers results in an additional
flattening of the inner-layer flat band manifold. Our results establish AA/AA
and AB/AA twisted double bilayers as interesting moir\'e materials with
different flat band physics compared to the widely studied AB/AB system.

entropy and the surface area of extremal ""islands"" in the de Sitter geometry.
The black hole and cosmological horizons both play a role in generating such

infinite bath and an ideal energy storage that is able to extract work from

quantum contribution that cannot be extracted as a work, and we find out its
thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we establish a general relation between
ergotropy and free energy of the arbitrary quantum system coupled to the heat

in the human brain, voltage changes in certain regions result from concerted
electrical activity which, in the form of action potentials (APs), travels
within nerve-cell arrays. Electrophysiological techniques like
electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging
are used to record this activity and to diagnose disorders. In the plant

similar amplitudes to those seen in humans and animals, and slow-wave

species like the ""sensitive plant"", Mimosa pudica, and the carnivorous Venus

Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Conventionally, there are two mainstream
neural architectures for NLP tasks: the recurrent neural network (RNN) and the
convolution neural network (ConvNet). RNNs are good at modeling long-term
dependencies over input texts, but preclude parallel computation. ConvNets do
not have memory capability and it has to model sequential data as un-ordered
features. Therefore, ConvNets fail to learn sequential dependencies over the
input texts, but it is able to carry out high-efficient parallel computation.
As each neural architecture, such as RNN and ConvNets, has its own pro and con,
integration of different architectures is assumed to be able to enrich the
semantic representation of texts, thus enhance the performance of NLP tasks.
However, few investigation explores the reconciliation of these seemingly
incompatible architectures. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid
architecture based on a novel hierarchical multi-granularity attention
mechanism, named Multi-granularity Attention-based Hybrid Neural Network
(MahNN). The attention mechanism is to assign different weights to different
parts of the input sequence to increase the computation efficiency and
performance of neural models. In MahNN, two types of attentions are introduced:
the syntactical attention and the semantical attention. The syntactical
attention computes the importance of the syntactic elements (such as words or
sentence) at the lower symbolic level and the semantical attention is used to
compute the importance of the embedded space dimension corresponding to the
upper latent semantics. We adopt the text classification as an exemplifying way
to illustrate the ability of MahNN to understand texts.

depths in Uranus and Neptune via the total induced Ohmic dissipation, due to
the interaction of the zonal flows and the planetary magnetic fields. An upper
bound can be placed on the induced dissipation via energy and entropy flux
throughout the interior. The induced Ohmic dissipation is directly linked to
the electrical conductivity profile of the materials involved in the flow. We
present a method for calculating electrical conductivity profiles of ionically
conducting hydrogen-helium-water mixtures under planetary conditions, using
results from ab initio simulations. We apply this prescription on several ice
giant interior structure models available in the literature, where all the
heavy elements are represented by water. According to the energy (entropy) flux
budget, the maximum penetration depth for Uranus lies above
$0.93R_{\mathrm{\scriptscriptstyle{U}}}$
($0.90R_{\mathrm{\scriptscriptstyle{U}}}$) and for Neptune above
$0.95R_{\mathrm{\scriptscriptstyle{N}}}$
($0.92R_{\mathrm{\scriptscriptstyle{N}}}$). These results for the penetration
depths are upper bounds, and are consistent with previous estimates based on
the contribution of the zonal winds to the gravity field. As expected, interior
structure models with higher water abundance in the outer regions have also a
higher electrical conductivity and therefore reach the Ohmic limit at shallower
regions. Thus, our study shows that the likelihood of deep-seated winds on
Uranus and Neptune drops significantly with the presence of water in the outer

charge current is parallel to the magnetization $\vec M$ in a ferromagnet or to
the Neel order $\vec n$ in an anti-ferromagnet. When the applied charge current

One is the spin current polarized along the order parameter and propagating
along the charge current direction. The other is the one polarized in the
charge current direction and propagating along the order parameter direction.
Charge currents proportional to the order parameter are generated by applied
spin currents in the anomalous ISHE. When a spin current whose propagation and
polarization are collinear is applied, the charge current is along the
perpendicular (to the spin current) component of order parameter, and no
current for order parameter along the spin current. For applied spin current
with propagation and polarization mutually orthogonal to each other, a charge
current along the spin current propagation direction is generated if the order
parameter is collinear with the polarization of the spin current. A charge
current along the polarization of spin current is generated if the order
parameter is collinear with the propagation direction of the spin current.
Experimental verifications are also proposed. In terms of applications, one of
the great advantages of anomalous SHE is that one can control the generated
spin or charge current by controlling the magnetization or the Neel order in
the magnetic materials.

we study the Gartstein internal-coordinate potential and tune its 13 parameters

it is fitted on the short-range (analytical) part of the interatomic force

magnitude higher luminosity, than in the previous Run 1. In consequence, the
power of the secondary beams emitted from the interaction points by the
bound-free pair production (BFPP) process increased by a factor ~20, while the
propensity of the bending magnets to quench increased with the higher magnetic
field. This beam power is about 35 times greater than that contained in the
luminosity debris from hadronic interactions and is focused on specific
locations that fall naturally inside superconducting magnets. The risk of
quenching these magnets has long been recognized as severe and there are
operational limitations due to the dynamic heat load that must be evacuated by
the cryogenic system. High-luminosity operation was nevertheless possible
thanks to orbit bumps that were introduced in the dispersion suppressors around
the ATLAS and CMS experiments to prevent quenches by displacing and spreading
out these beam losses. Further, in 2015, the BFPP beams were manipulated to
induce a controlled quench, thus providing the first direct measurement of the
steady-state quench level of an LHC dipole magnet. The same experiment
demonstrated the need for new collimators that are being installed around the
ALICE experiment to intercept the secondary beams in the future. This paper
discusses the experience with BFPP at luminosities very close to the future
High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) target, gives results on the risk reduction by

framework of thermodynamics of irreversible processes. We briefly review the
two well-known main approaches, leading to the generalized Fick-Onsager
multicomponent diffusion fluxes or to the generalized Maxwell-Stefan equations.
The latter approach has the advantage that the resulting fluxes are consistent
with non-negativity of the partial mass densities for non-singular and
non-degenerate Maxwell-Stefan diffusivities. On the other hand, this approach
requires computationally expensive matrix inversions since the fluxes are only
implicitly given. We propose and discuss a novel and more direct closure which
avoids the inversion of the Maxwell-Stefan equations. It is shown that all
three closures are actually equivalent under the natural requirement of
positivity for the concentrations, thus revealing the general structure of
continuum thermodynamical diffusion fluxes. As a special case, the new closure
also gives rise to a core-diagonal diffusion model in which only those
cross-effects are present that are necessary to guarantee consistency with
total mass conservation, plus a compositional dependence of the diffusivity.
This core-diagonal closure turns out to provide a rigorous fundament for recent
extensions of the Darken equation from binary mixtures to the general
multicomponent case. As an outcome of our investigation, we also address
different questions related to the sign of multicomponent thermodynamic or
Fickian diffusion coefficients. We show rigorously that in general the second
law requires positivity properties for tensors and operators rather than for
scalar diffusivities.

language processing. Most of the pretraining methods first randomly mask some
positions in a sentence and then train a model to recover the tokens at the
masked positions. In such a way, the model can be trained without human
labeling, and the massive data can be used with billion parameters. Therefore,
the optimization efficiency becomes critical. In this paper, we tackle the
problem from the view of gradient variance reduction. In particular, we first
propose a principled gradient variance decomposition theorem, which shows that
the variance of the stochastic gradient of the language pretraining can be
naturally decomposed into two terms: the variance that arises from the sample
of data in a batch, and the variance that arises from the sampling of the mask.
The second term is the key difference between selfsupervised learning and
supervised learning, which makes the pretraining slower. In order to reduce the
variance of the second part, we leverage the importance sampling strategy,
which aims at sampling the masks according to a proposal distribution instead
of the uniform distribution. It can be shown that if the proposal distribution
is proportional to the gradient norm, the variance of the sampling is reduced.
To improve efficiency, we introduced a MAsk Proposal Network (MAPNet), which
approximates the optimal mask proposal distribution and is trained end-to-end
along with the model. According to the experimental result, our model converges
much faster and achieves higher performance than the baseline BERT model.

correct-by-construction systems and has been thoroughly investigated in the
last decades. It consists in the synthesis of a controller that reacts to
environment's inputs satisfying a given temporal logic specification. Common
approaches are based on the explicit construction of automata and on their
determinization, which limit their scalability.
  In this paper, we introduce a new fragment of Linear Temporal Logic, called
Extended Bounded Response LTL (\LTLEBR), that allows one to combine bounded and
universal unbounded temporal operators (thus covering a large set of practical
cases), and we show that reactive synthesis from \LTLEBR specifications can be
reduced to solving a safety game over a deterministic symbolic automaton built
directly from the specification. We prove the correctness of the proposed
approach and we successfully evaluate it on various benchmarks.

another based on their positions in a social space. Yet a principled measure of
social distance, allowing comparison within and between societies, remains
elusive. We use the connectivity kernel of conditionally-independent edge
models to develop a family of segregation statistics with desirable properties:
they offer an intuitive and universal characteristic scale on social space
(facilitating comparison across datasets and societies), are applicable to
multivariate and mixed node attributes, and capture segregation at the level of
individuals, pairs of individuals, and society as a whole. We show that the
segregation statistics can induce a metric on Blau space (a space spanned by
the attributes of the members of society) and provide maps of two societies.
Under a Bayesian paradigm, we infer the parameters of the connectivity kernel
from eleven ego-network datasets collected in four surveys in the United
Kingdom and United States. The importance of different dimensions of Blau space
is similar across time and location, suggesting a macroscopically stable social
fabric. Physical separation and age differences have the most significant
impact on segregation within friendship networks with implications for
intergenerational mixing and isolation in later stages of life.

the rank-one property of the channel matrices, we show that the single-stream

proposed for optimizing the scalar variables. Simulation results demonstrate

vertex subset problems in graph classes with quickly computable and bounded
min-width -- that the $k$-tuple domination problem is solvable in time
$\mathcal{O}(|V(G)|^{6k+4})$ in the class of circular-arc graphs. In this work,
we develop faster algorithms for $k$-tuple domination in co-biconvex graphs and
in web graphs, which are incomparable subclasses of concave-round graphs and
thus of circular-arc graphs. On the one hand, we present an
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$-time algorithm for solving it for each $2\leq k\leq |U|+3$,

degree of each vertex of the input web graph $G$. We complete this study for

parameter, which appears as an overall multiplicative factor in the action.
Examples of such theories are gauge theories coupled to massless scalars and
fermions with Yukawa interactions and quartic couplings for the scalars in
spacetime dimensions other than 4. Many properties of such theories are similar
to that of conformal field theories (CFT), and in particular their 2-point
functions take the same form as in CFT but with the normalisation constant now
replaced by a function of the effective dimensionless coupling $g$ constructed
from the dimensionful parameter and the distance separating the two operators.
Such theories appear in holographic dualities involving non-conformal branes
and this behaviour of the correlators has already been observed at strong
coupling. Here we present a perturbative computation of the two-point function
of the energy-momentum tensor to two loops in dimensions $d= 3, 5$, confirming
the expected structure and determining the corresponding functions of $g$ to
this order, including the effects of renormalisation. We also discuss the d=4
case for comparison. The results for $d=3$ are relevant for holographic
cosmology, and in this case we also study the effect of a $\Phi^6$ coupling,
which while marginal in the usual sense it is irrelevant from the perspective
of the generalised conformal structure. Indeed, the effect of such coupling in
the 2-point function is washed out in the IR but it modifies the UV.

into non-trivial structures that can be represented by networks. A key emergent
property of such systems is robustness against random failures or targeted
attacks ---i.e. the capacity of a network to maintain its integrity under
removal of nodes or links. Here, we introduce network entanglement to study
network robustness through a multi-scale lens, encoded by the time required to
diffuse information through the system. Our measure's foundation lies upon a
recently proposed framework, manifestly inspired by quantum statistical
physics, where networks are interpreted as collections of entangled units and
can be characterized by Gibbsian-like density matrices. We show that at the
smallest temporal scales entanglement reduces to node degree, whereas at the
large scale we show its ability to measure the role played by each node in
network integrity. At the meso-scale, entanglement incorporates information
beyond the structure, such as system's transport properties. As an application,
we show that network dismantling of empirical social, biological and
transportation systems unveils the existence of a optimal temporal scale
driving the network to disintegration. Our results open the door for novel
multi-scale analysis of network contraction process and its impact on dynamical

rate monitoring. To improve robustness to ambient noise and motion artefacts,
our device uses an algorithm that explicitly segments the collected audio into

Thus, there is an urgent need for developing treatments for COVID-19. Drug
repurposing, which is the process of reusing already-approved drugs for new
medical conditions, can be a good way to solve this problem quickly and
broadly. Many clinical trials for COVID-19 patients using treatments for other
diseases have already been in place or will be performed at clinical sites in
the near future. Additionally, patients with comorbidities such as diabetes
mellitus, obesity, liver cirrhosis, kidney diseases, hypertension, and asthma
are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19. Thus, the relationship of
comorbidity disease with COVID-19 may help to find repurposable drugs. To
reduce trial and error in finding treatments for COVID-19, we propose building
a network-based drug repurposing framework to prioritize repurposable drugs.
First, we utilized knowledge of COVID-19 to construct a disease-gene-drug
network (DGDr-Net) representing a COVID-19-centric interactome with components
for diseases, genes, and drugs. DGDr-Net consisted of 592 diseases, 26,681
human genes and 2,173 drugs, and medical information for 18 common
comorbidities. The DGDr-Net recommended candidate repurposable drugs for
COVID-19 through network reinforcement driven scoring algorithms. The scoring
algorithms determined the priority of recommendations by utilizing graph-based
semi-supervised learning. From the predicted scores, we recommended 30 drugs,
including dexamethasone, resveratrol, methotrexate, indomethacin, quercetin,
etc., as repurposable drugs for COVID-19, and the results were verified with
drugs that have been under clinical trials. The list of drugs via a data-driven

one of its points fixed is equivalent to a single rotation about an axis
passing through the fixed point. The theorem forms the basis for Chasles'
theorem which states that it is always possible to represent the general
displacement of a rigid body by a translation and a rotation about an axis.
Though there are many ways to achieve this, the direction of the rotation axis
and angle of rotation are independent of the translation vector. The theorem is
important in the study of rigid body dynamics. There are various proofs
available for these theorems, both geometric and algebraic. A novel geometric
proof of Euler rotation theorem is presented here which makes use of two
successive rotations about two mutually perpendicular axis to go from one
configuration of the rigid body to the other with one of its points fixed.

Of the six conceivable inclusions within these three pairs, only one is
generally valid. On the orthomorphisms of a Dedekind complete vector lattice,
however, five are generally valid, and the sixth is valid for order bounded

orthomorphisms on a Banach lattice, as a consequence of a uniform order
boundedness principle for orthomorphisms that we establish. We also show that,
in contrast to general order bounded operators, the orthomorphisms preserve not
only order convergence of nets, but unbounded order convergence and -- when
applicable -- convergence in the Hausdorff uo-Lebesgue topology as well.

prediction performance. To address these challenges, we have designed and
developed Data Augmentation from Proficient Pre-Training of Robust Generative

automatically generates novel views of training images in order to improve
downstream classifier performance. DAPPER GAN leverages high-fidelity
embeddings generated by a StyleGAN2 model (trained on the LSUN cars dataset) to
create novel imagery for previously unseen classes. We experimentally evaluate
this technique on the Stanford Cars dataset, demonstrating improved vehicle

supported through an analysis of classifier performance on both augmented and
non-augmented datasets, achieving comparable or better accuracy with up to 30\%

developed a novel augmentation method that can manipulate semantically

between 434 nm and 761 nm corresponding to colors of $g$-$r$ = 0.62$\pm$0.08,
$r$-$i$ = 0.21 $\pm$ 0.06 and an absorption band at ~900 nm corresponding to

materials for multifunctional energy storage devices, either as current

lithiation/delithiation in CNTFs is substantially different from traditional
graphite electrodes. In CNTFs this process is dominated by surface processes,
insertion in the bundles interstices, electrochemical doping and
often-overlooked partial degradation of the sp2 lattice upon cycling. Through
extensive electrochemical analysis, together with in situ Raman spectroscopy
measurements, we analyzed the complex lithiation behavior of highly crystalline
fibers of CNTs. CNTF can store lithium reversibly with high specific capacity
and rate capability, thanks to a large capacitive contribution. Upon
lithiation, they undergo electrochemical doping, with longitudinal conductivity
increasing by as much as 100 %, concomitant with large downshifts in Raman
spectra. However, CNTF are also affected by high first-cycle irreversible
capacity, voltage hysteresis and amorphization upon cycling. Electrochemical
analysis confirms that SEI formation is responsible for the first-cycle
irreversible capacity. Voltage hysteresis is attributed primarily to the
trapping of lithium ions in the interstices between stacked nanotubes. Another
dominant feature is pre-existing defects, which promote capacitive storage but
lead to progressive amorphization of the CNTFs. Indeed, it is evidenced that
undesired amorphization is hindered in ultra-pure CNTF without pre-existing
defects.

present a novel hybrid dynamic and multi-collaborative filtering method to
improve information retrieval from electronic health records. This method
recommends relevant information from electronic health records for physicians
during patient visits. It models information search dynamics using a Markov
model. It also leverages the key idea of collaborative filtering, originating
from Recommender Systems, to prioritize information based on various
similarities among physicians, patients and information items. We tested this
new method using real electronic health record data from the Indiana Network
for Patient Care. Our experimental results demonstrated that for 46.7% of
testing cases, this new method is able to correctly prioritize relevant
information among top-5 recommendations that physicians are truly interested
in.

So far, the reported {\tau}DL exerted on a thin-film magnet must result from an
externally generated spin current or from an internal non-equilibrium spin
polarization in noncentrosymmetric GaMnAs single crystals. Here, we for the
first time demonstrate a very strong, unexpected {\tau}DL from current flow
within ferromagnetic single layers of chemically disordered,

effect, with the strength per unit current density increasing monotonically
with the CoPt thickness, and is insensitive to the presence or absence of spin
sinks at the CoPt surfaces. This {\tau}DL most likely arises from a net
transverse spin polarization associated with a strong spin Hall effect (SHE),
while there is no detectable long-range asymmetry in the material. These
results broaden the scope of spin-orbitronics and provide a novel avenue for
developing single-layer-based spin-torque memory, oscillator, and logic

that are infalling for the first time from those that occupy more evolved
orbits. We find that roughly 21 per cent of subhaloes within a host's virial
radius are currently on first infall, and have not yet reached their first
orbital pericentre; roughly 44 per cent are still approaching their first
apocentre after infall. For the range of host masses studied, roughly half of
all accreted systems were pre-processed prior to infall, and about 20 per cent
were accreted in groups. We confirm that the entire population of accreted
subhaloes -- often referred to as ""associated"" subhaloes -- extend far beyond
the virial radii of their hosts, with roughly half currently residing at
distances that exceed $\approx 1.2\times r_{200}$. Many of these backsplash
haloes have gained orbital energy since infall, and occupy extreme orbits that
carry them well past their initial turnaround radii. Such extreme orbits are
created during the initial accretion and dissolution of loosely bound groups,
but also through penetrating encounters between subhaloes on subsequent orbits.
The same processes may also give rise to unexpectedly abrupt losses of orbital
energy. These effects combine, giving rise to a large variation in the ratio of
sequent apocentres for accreted systems. We find that, within 2 virial radii
from host centres, the concentrations of first-infall halos are remarkably
similar those of isolated field halos, whereas backsplash haloes, as well as
systems that were pre-processed, are considerably more concentrated.

on a limited volume of recent house transaction data. As a departure from prior
work, Luce organizes the house data in a heterogeneous information network
(HIN) where graph nodes are house entities and attributes that are important
for house price valuation. We employ a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to
extract the spatial information from the HIN for house-related data like
geographical locations, and then use a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network to
model the temporal dependencies for house transaction data over time. Unlike
prior work, Luce can make effective use of the limited house transactions data
in the past few months to update valuation information for all house entities
within the HIN. By providing a complete and up-to-date house valuation dataset,
Luce thus massively simplifies the downstream valuation task for the targeting
properties. We demonstrate the benefit of Luce by applying it to large,

genetic coding. This model has led to a rather precise description of what
might have occurred at the beginning of protein synthesis in the first life
form. Here, we further discuss some interesting implications of this model.
First, the system of encoded peptide/protein synthesis appears to have started
and developed on the breeding ground of a rich RNA world, responsible for the
infancy of life existence and complexity. Furthermore, once protein synthesis
was fully established and apparently superseding the RNA world, and at a very
early stage of life beginnings, we already see what has been a recurrent theme
in the likely interpretation of modern comparative molecular studies on
species: the full ability of this nascent life entity to develop itself by
tinkering, using all kinds of available pieces to improve itself. Lastly, and
very instructively, it is deduced from this model that the first peptides to be
produced probably had unique properties, not shared by the arsenal of molecules
present hitherto, which allowed a functional connection between the then
omnipotent RNA world and the lipid membrane vesicles containing it. These
specific functions might have initially been at the origin of the Darwinian
selection of the full-blown protein-synthesis machinery.

representation of the time-evolving graphs as fixed-length feature vectors
preserving the original dynamics. We propose a method for learning the
embedding of the time-evolving graph that is based on the spectral analysis of
transfer operators and graph kernels. We demonstrate that our method can
capture temporary changes in the time-evolving graph on both created synthetic
data and real-world data. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the
method. Furthermore, we show that our method can be applied to human microbiome
data to study dynamic processes.

(e.g. metabolic activity) and longer time scales (e.g. evolutionary selection),
along with their complex spatial organization. Because of their complexity and
their ability to innovate with respect to their environment, living systems are
considered to be open-ended. Historically, it has been difficult to model
open-ended evolution and innovation. As a result, our understanding of the
exact mechanisms that distinguish open-ended living systems from non-living
ones is limited. One of the biggest barriers is understanding how multiple,
complex parts within a single system interact and contribute to the complex,
emergent behavior of the system as a whole. How do interactions between parts
of a system lead to more complex behavior of the system as a whole? This paper
presents two interacting cellular automata (CA) as an abstract model to address
the effects of complex interactions between two individual entities embedded
within a larger system. Unlike elementary CA, each CA changes its update rules
as a function of the system's state as a whole. The resulting behavior of the
two-CA system suggests that complex interaction functions between the two CA
have little to no effect on the complexity of each individual CA behavior and
structure. However, having an interaction function that is random results in
open-ended evolution regardless of the specific type of state-dependency.

vehicles, playing a crucial role in autonomous driving and road safety. The
broad adoption of radar sensors increases the chance of interference among
sensors from different vehicles, generating corrupted range profiles and
range-Doppler maps. In order to extract distance and velocity of multiple
targets from range-Doppler maps, the interference affecting each range profile
needs to be mitigated. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional neural
network for automotive radar interference mitigation. In order to train our
network in a real-world scenario, we introduce a new data set of realistic
automotive radar signals with multiple targets and multiple interferers. To our
knowledge, we are the first to apply weight pruning in the automotive radar
domain, obtaining superior results compared to the widely-used dropout. While
most previous works successfully estimated the magnitude of automotive radar
signals, we propose a deep learning model that can accurately estimate the
phase. For instance, our novel approach reduces the phase estimation error with
respect to the commonly-adopted zeroing technique by half, from 12.55 degrees
to 6.58 degrees. Considering the lack of databases for automotive radar
interference mitigation, we release as open source our large-scale data set
that closely replicates the real-world automotive scenario for multiple
interference cases, allowing others to objectively compare their future work in
this domain. Our data set is available for download at:

(MAIC) are increasingly used to compare marginal treatment effects when there
are cross-trial differences in effect modifiers and limited patient-level data.
MAIC is sensitive to poor covariate overlap and cannot extrapolate beyond the
observed covariate space. Current outcome regression-based alternatives can
extrapolate but target a conditional treatment effect that is incompatible in
the indirect comparison. When adjusting for covariates, one must integrate or
average the conditional estimate over the population of interest to recover a
compatible marginal treatment effect. We propose a marginalization method based
on parametric G-computation that can be easily applied where the outcome
regression is a generalized linear model or a Cox model. In addition, we
introduce a novel general-purpose method based on multiple imputation, which we
term multiple imputation marginalization (MIM) and is applicable to a wide
range of models. Both methods can accommodate a Bayesian statistical framework,
which naturally integrates the analysis into a probabilistic framework. A
simulation study provides proof-of-principle for the methods and benchmarks
their performance against MAIC and the conventional outcome regression. The
marginalized outcome regression approaches achieve more precise and more
accurate estimates than MAIC, particularly when covariate overlap is poor, and
yield unbiased marginal treatment effect estimates under no failures of
assumptions. Furthermore, the marginalized regression-adjusted estimates
provide greater precision and accuracy than the conditional estimates produced
by the conventional outcome regression, which are systematically biased because
the measure of effect is non-collapsible.

as a whole and of the corresponding radius vector is determined. This radius
vector defines any fixed point of the envelope of the moving wave packet
characterizing the particle and its group velocity differs from the group
velocities of any points of the wavefront. We consider free massless scalar and
Dirac particles, the photon, and massive and massless particles with an
arbitrary spin and describe them in different representations. For particles
with an arbitrary spin, the generalized Feshbach-Villars representation and the
Foldy-Wouthuysen one are used. Zitterbewegung takes place in any representation
except for the Foldy-Wouthuysen one. Formulas describing the motion of a
""trembling"" free particle are the same in any representation. In the
Foldy-Wouthuysen representation, the operators of the velocity and momentum of
a free particle are proportional and Zitterbewegung does not take place. Since
the radius vector (position) and velocity operators are the quantum-mechanical

learning framework to learn signals in low-frequency financial time series
data. The framework is proved on daily sampled closing time-series data from
JSE equity markets. The input patterns are vectors of pre-processed sequences
of daily, weekly and monthly or quarterly sampled feature changes. The data
processing is split into a batch processed step where features are learnt using
a stacked autoencoder via unsupervised learning, and then both batch and online
supervised learning are carried out using these learnt features, with the
output being a point prediction of measured time-series feature fluctuations.
Weight initializations are implemented with restricted Boltzmann machine
pre-training, and variance based initializations. Historical simulations are
then run using an online feedforward neural network initialised with the
weights from the batch training and validation step. The validity of results
are considered under a rigorous assessment of backtest overfitting using both
combinatorially symmetrical cross validation and probabilistic and deflated
Sharpe ratios. Results are used to develop a view on the phenomenology of
financial markets and the value of complex historical data-analysis for trading
under the unstable adaptive dynamics that characterise financial markets.

  Digit Recognition","10 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We report that a very high accuracy on the MNIST test set can be achieved by
using simple convolutional neural network (CNN) models. We use three different
models with 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7 kernel size in the convolution layers. Each model
consists of a set of convolution layers followed by a single fully connected
layer. Every convolution layer uses batch normalization and ReLU activation,
and pooling is not used. Rotation and translation is used to augment training
data, which is frequently used in most image classification tasks. A majority
voting using the three models independently trained on the training data set
can achieve up to 99.87% accuracy on the test set, which is one of the
state-of-the-art results. A two-layer ensemble, a heterogeneous ensemble of
three homogeneous ensemble networks, can achieve up to 99.91% test accuracy.
The results can be reproduced by using the code at:

  media with evolving Beavers-Joseph-Saffman condition",,,,,"physics.flu-dyn cs.CE","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  This study presents a phase field model for brittle fracture in
fluid-infiltrating vuggy porous media. While the state-of-the-art in hydraulic
phase field fracture considers Darcian fracture flow with enhanced permeability
along the crack, in this study, the phase field not only acts as a damage
variable that provides diffuse representation of cracks or cavities, but also
acts as an indicator function that separates the domain into two regions where
fluid flows are governed by Stokes and Darcy equations, respectively. Since the
phase field and its gradient can be respectively regarded as smooth
approximations of the Heaviside function and Dirac delta function, our new
approach is capable of imposing interfacial transmissibility conditions without
explicit interface parametrizations. In addition, the interaction between solid
and fluid constituents is modeled by adopting the concept of mixture theory,
where the fluid velocities in Stokes and Darcy regions are considered as
relative measures compared to the solid motion. This model is particularly
attractive for coupled flow analysis in geological materials with complex
microstructures undergoing brittle fracture often encountered in energy
geotechnics problems, since it completely eliminates the needs to generate
specific enrichment function, integration scheme, or meshing algorithm tailored
for complex geological features.

  https://github.com/ethanhezhao/NeuralSinkhornTopicModel",,,,"cs.IR cs.CL cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Recently, Neural Topic Models (NTMs) inspired by variational autoencoders
have obtained increasingly research interest due to their promising results on
text analysis. However, it is usually hard for existing NTMs to achieve good
document representation and coherent/diverse topics at the same time. Moreover,
they often degrade their performance severely on short documents. The
requirement of reparameterisation could also comprise their training quality
and model flexibility. To address these shortcomings, we present a new neural
topic model via the theory of optimal transport (OT). Specifically, we propose
to learn the topic distribution of a document by directly minimising its OT
distance to the document's word distributions. Importantly, the cost matrix of
the OT distance models the weights between topics and words, which is
constructed by the distances between topics and words in an embedding space.
Our proposed model can be trained efficiently with a differentiable loss.
Extensive experiments show that our framework significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art NTMs on discovering more coherent and diverse topics and
deriving better document representations for both regular and short texts.
