  Target Tracking by Internet-of-UAVs","Accepted by IEEE IoTJ",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The empowering unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been extensively used in
providing intelligence such as target tracking. In our field experiments, a
pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) is deployed at the UAV to
identify a target (a vehicle) from the captured video frames and enable the UAV
to keep tracking. However, this kind of visual target tracking demands a lot of
computational resources due to the desired high inference accuracy and
stringent delay requirement. This motivates us to consider offloading this type
of deep learning (DL) tasks to a mobile edge computing (MEC) server due to
limited computational resource and energy budget of the UAV, and further
improve the inference accuracy. Specifically, we propose a novel hierarchical
DL tasks distribution framework, where the UAV is embedded with lower layers of
the pre-trained CNN model, while the MEC server with rich computing resources
will handle the higher layers of the CNN model. An optimization problem is
formulated to minimize the weighted-sum cost including the tracking delay and
energy consumption introduced by communication and computing of the UAVs, while
taking into account the quality of data (e.g., video frames) input to the DL
model and the inference errors. Analytical results are obtained and insights
are provided to understand the tradeoff between the weighted-sum cost and
inference error rate in the proposed framework. Numerical results demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed offloading framework.

Friedrichs-Lee model combined with a relativistic quark pair creation model in
a consistent manner. This kind of two-pole structure could be found when a
$q\bar q$ state couples to the open-flavor continuum state in the $S$ partial
wave. We found that many enigmatic states, such as $f_0(500)/\sigma$,
$K_0^*(700)/\kappa$, $a_0(980)$, $f_0(980)$, $D_0^*(2300)$, $D_{s0}^*(2317)$,
and $X(3872)$, together with another higher state for each, all result from
this kind of two-pole structures. Furthermore, an interesting observation is
that this kind of two-pole structure will contribute roughly a total of
180$^\circ$ phase shift for the scattering process in a single channel
approximation. This relativistic scheme may provide more insights into the
understanding of the properties of non-$q\bar q$ state. It is also suggested
that such two-pole structure could be a common phenomenon which deserves
studying both from theoretical and experimental perspectives.

determined by the dynamical properties of the vortex matter hosted by the
material. A crucial element in this phenomenology is vortex pinning by material
defects, e.g., immobilizing vortices at small drives and thereby guaranteeing
dissipation-free current flow. Pinning models for vortices and other
topological defects, such as domain walls in magnets or dislocations in
crystals, come in two standard variants: i) weak collective pinning, where
individual weak defects are unable to pin, while the random accumulation of
many force centers within a collective pinning volume combines into an
effective pin, and ii) strong pinning, where strong defects produce large
vortex displacements and bistabilities that lead to pinning on the level of
individual defects. The transition between strong and weak pinning is
quantified by the Labusch criterion $\kappa \approx f_p/\bar{C}\xi = 1$, where
$f_p$ and $\bar{C}$ are the force of one defect and the effective elasticity of
the vortex lattice, respectively ($\xi$ is the coherence length). Here, we show
that a third generic type of pinning becomes dominant when the pinning force
$f_p$ enters the weak regime, the pinning by rare events. We find that within
an intermediate regime $1/2 < \kappa < 1$, compact pairs of weak defects define
strong pinning clusters that extend the mechanism of strong pinning into the
weak regime. We present a detailed analysis of this cluster-pinning mechanism
and show that its pinning-force density parametrically dominates over the weak
pinning result. The present work is a first attempt to include correlations
between defects into the discussion of strong pinning.

moment, there are no available large dataset of masked face images that permits
to check if detected masked faces are correctly worn or not. Indeed, many
people are not correctly wearing their masks due to bad practices, bad
behaviors or vulnerability of individuals (e.g., children, old people). For
these reasons, several mask wearing campaigns intend to sensitize people about
this problem and good practices. In this sense, this work proposes three types
of masked face detection dataset; namely, the Correctly Masked Face Dataset

the global masked face detection (MaskedFace-Net). Realistic masked face
datasets are proposed with a twofold objective: i) to detect people having
their faces masked or not masked, ii) to detect faces having their masks
correctly worn or incorrectly worn (e.g.; at airport portals or in crowds). To

which is consistent with the NLS1 definition of the source. However, no
variability is seen below 3 keV on any timescale. Two distinct physical models
are adopted to describe the data above and below ~3 keV. The low energies are
dominated by a hot, diffuse gas likely associated with a starburst component at
large physical scales. The higher energy spectrum is dominated by emission from
the central region. Ionised partial covering and relativistic blurred
reflection are considered for the central region emission. In both cases, the
underlying power law has a photon index of $\Gamma\sim2.3-2.4$. A distant
reflector, a neutral partial covering component with a covering fraction near
$\sim1$, and contributions from starburst emission are always required. The
blurred reflection model requires a reflection dominated spectrum, which may be
at odds with the low emissivity index and radio properties of the source. By
contrast, the two absorption components required in the ionised partial
covering model may correspond to the two distinct regions of polarization
observed in the optical. Regardless of the physical model, spectral changes
between epochs are driven by the absorption components and on short time scales
by intrinsic AGN variability.

objective of compressed sensing. Often one comes across signals that are not
ordinarily sparse but are sparse blockwise. Existing block sparse recovery
algorithms like BOMP make the assumption of uniform block size and known block
boundaries, which are, however, not very practical in many applications. This
paper addresses this problem and proposes a two step procedure, where the first
stage is a coarse block location identification stage while the second stage
carries out finer localization of a non-zero cluster within the window selected
in the first stage. A detailed convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm
is carried out by first defining the so-called pseudoblock-interleaved block
RIP of the given generalized block sparse signal and then imposing upper bounds
on the corresponding RIC. We also extend the analysis for complex vector as
well as matrix entries where it turns out that the extension is non-trivial and
requires special care. Furthermore, assuming real Gaussian sensing matrix
entries, we find a lower bound on the probability that the derived recovery
bounds are satisfied. The lower bound suggests that there are sets of
parameters such that the derived bound is satisfied with high probability.
Simulation results confirm significantly improved performance of the proposed

edges from a distribution that is pointwise $\epsilon$-close to the uniform
distribution, in an \emph{amortized-efficient} fashion. We consider the
adjacency list query model, where access to a graph $G$ is given via degree and
neighbor queries.
  The problem of sampling a single edge in this model has been raised by Eden
and Rosenbaum (SOSA 18). Let $n$ and $m$ denote the number of vertices and
edges of $G$, respectively. Eden and Rosenbaum provided upper and lower bounds
of $\Theta^*(n/\sqrt m)$ for sampling a single edge in general graphs (where
$O^*(\cdot)$ suppresses $\textrm{poly}(1/\epsilon)$ and $\textrm{poly}(\log n)$
dependencies). We ask whether the query complexity lower bound for sampling a
single edge can be circumvented when multiple samples are required. That is,
can we get an improved amortized per-sample cost if we allow a preprocessing
phase? We answer in the affirmative.
  We present an algorithm that, if one knows the number of required samples $q$
in advance, has an overall cost that is sublinear in $q$, namely, $O^*(\sqrt q
\cdot(n/\sqrt m))$, which is strictly preferable to $O^*(q\cdot (n/\sqrt m))$
cost resulting from $q$ invocations of the algorithm by Eden and Rosenbaum.
  Subsequent to a preliminary version of this work, T\v{e}tek and Thorup
(arXiv, preprint) proved that this bound is essentially optimal.

bandit algorithm -- the Fast Approximate Bayesian Contextual Cold Start
Learning algorithm (FAB-COST) -- is proposed, which is designed to provide
improved accuracy compared to the traditionally used Laplace approximation in
the logistic contextual bandit, while controlling both algorithmic complexity
and computational cost. To this end, FAB-COST uses a combination of two moment
projection variational methods: Expectation Propagation (EP), which performs
well at the cold start, but becomes slow as the amount of data increases; and
Assumed Density Filtering (ADF), which has slower growth of computational cost
with data size but requires more data to obtain an acceptable level of
accuracy. By switching from EP to ADF when the dataset becomes large, it is
able to exploit their complementary strengths. The empirical justification for
FAB-COST is presented, and systematically compared to other approaches on
simulated data. In a benchmark against the Laplace approximation on real data
consisting of over $670,000$ impressions from autotrader.co.uk, FAB-COST
demonstrates at one point increase of over $16\%$ in user clicks. On the basis
of these results, it is argued that FAB-COST is likely to be an attractive

work we optimize over all possible specifications of the nested logit model
that are consistent with rational utility maximization. We formulate the
problem of learning an optimal nesting structure from the data as a mixed
integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) optimization problem and solve it using a
variant of the linear outer approximation algorithm. We exploit the tree
structure of the problem and utilize the latest advances in integer
optimization to bring practical tractability to the optimization problem we
introduce. We demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to correctly recover the
true nesting structure from synthetic data in a Monte Carlo experiment. In an
empirical illustration using a stated preference survey on modes of
transportation in the U.S. state of Massachusetts, we use our algorithm to
obtain an optimal nesting tree representing the correlations between the
unobserved effects of the different travel mode choices. We provide our
implementation as a customizable and open-source code base written in the Julia
programming language.

points that greatly improve integration accuracy under mild assumptions on the
problem. Because QMC can give errors that are $o(1/n)$ as $n\to\infty$,
changing even one point can change the estimate by an amount much larger than
the error would have been and worsen the convergence rate. As a result, certain
practices that fit quite naturally and intuitively with MC points are very
detrimental to QMC performance. These include thinning, burn-in, and taking
sample sizes such as powers of $10$, other than the ones for which the QMC
points were designed. This article looks at the effects of a common practice in
which one skips the first point of a Sobol' sequence. The retained points
ordinarily fail to be a digital net and when scrambling is applied, skipping
over the first point can increase the numerical error by a factor proportional
to $\sqrt{n}$ where $n$ is the number of function evaluations used.

proxy to measure metallicity from individual stellar spectra of bright red
giant stars. It is a mandatory step to remove the magnitude (proxy for gravity,
temperature and luminosity) dependence from the equivalent width (EW) of the
lines before converting them into metallicities. The working empirical
procedure used for decades is to use the relative magnitude with respect to the
horizontal branch level. Aims. The V filter is broadly adopted as the reference
magnitude, although a few works have used different filters (I and Ks, for
example). In this work we investigate the dependence of the CaT calibration
using griz filters from the DECam and the GMOS, G from Gaia, BVI filters from
the MCPS, YJKs filters from VIRCAM. We use as a reference FORS2 V filter used
in the original analysis of the sample. Methods. Red giant stars from clusters
with known metallicity and available CaT equivalent widths are used as
reference. Public photometric catalogues are taken from SMASH DR2, VMC, Gaia,
MCPS surveys plus VISCACHA-GMOS data, for a selection of Small Magellanic Cloud
clusters. The slopes are fitted using two and three lines to be applicable to
most of the metallicity scales. Results. The magnitude dependence of the CaT
EWs is well described by a linear relation using any filter analysed in this
work. The slope increases with wavelength of the filters. The zero point
(a.k.a. reduced equivalent width), that is the metallicity indicator, remains
the same. Conclusions. If the same line profile function is used with the same
bandpasses and continuum regions, and the total EW comes from the same number
of lines (2 or 3), then the reduced EW is the same regardless the filter used.
Therefore, any filter can be used to convert the CaT equivalent widths into
metallicity for a given CaT calibration.

important in reservoirs with abundant fractures and faults because the induced

The objective of this study is to develop a numerical method that does not
require gridding near fractures and can efficiently model hydromechanical
interactions in fractured reservoirs. We utilize formulations based on the
Strong Discontinuity Approach (SDA) for mechanics and Embedded Discrete

the launch phase which covers the motion of the missile from the launch to the
water-exit and continues with the boost phase which lasts from the water-exit
to the beginning of the cruise phase. In order to achieve the desired range of
the launch and boost phases, efficient utilization of available energy which
carries the missile to the beginning of the cruise phase is necessary. For this
purpose, this study presents a new approach for energy-optimal control of the
underwater and air motion of a submarine-launched cruise missile. In this
approach, the aforementioned problem is modeled and solved as a minimum-effort
optimal control problem. Then, the effects of initial and final conditions on
energy need are investigated, and the optimal conditions that result with the
minimum energy need are determined. Prior to the guidance and control design
steps, six degrees of freedom (6 DOF) motion equations are derived and the
hydrodynamic and aerodynamic parameters are retrieved. The nonlinear 6 DOF
motion model is simplified and linearized before minimum-effort optimal control
design part. Results of the designed guidance and control strategies are
presented through the nonlinear 6 DOF simulations. Finally, some comments are
made and future studies are mentioned based on theoretical and simulation
studies.

made a recommendation to study a large/medium-class dedicated space telescope
for planetary science, going beyond the Discovery-class dedicated planetary
space telescope endorsed in Visions and Voyages. Such a telescope would observe
targets across the entire solar system, engaging a broad spectrum of the
science community. It would ensure that the high-resolution, high-sensitivity
observations of the solar system in visible and UV wavelengths revolutionized
by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) could be extended. A dedicated telescope
for solar system science would: (a) transform our understanding of
time-dependent phenomena in our solar system that cannot be studied currently
under programs to observe and visit new targets and (b) enable a comprehensive
survey and spectral characterization of minor bodies across the solar system,
which requires a large time allocation not supported by existing facilities.
The time-domain phenomena to be explored are critically reliant on high spatial
resolution UV-visible observations. This paper presents science themes and key
questions that require a long-lasting space telescope dedicated to planetary
science that can capture high-quality, consistent data at the required cadences
that are free from effects of the terrestrial atmosphere and differences across
observing facilities. Such a telescope would have excellent synergy with
astrophysical facilities by placing planetary discoveries made by astrophysics
assets in temporal context, as well as triggering detailed follow-up
observations using larger telescopes. The telescope would support future
missions to the Ice Giants, Ocean Worlds, and minor bodies across the solar
system by placing the results of such targeted missions in the context of
longer records of temporal activities and larger sample populations.

both the layers exhibit complex intra-and-interdependencies between them. A
reliable decision making by the smart grid operator is contingent upon correct
analysis of such dependencies between its entities and also on accurate
identification of the most critical entities in the system. The Modified
Implicative Interdependency Model (MIIM) [1] successfully captures such
dependencies using multi-valued Boolean Logic based equations called
Interdependency Relations (IDRs) after most of the existing models made failed
attempts in doing that. In this paper, for any given integer K, this model is
used to identify the K-most vulnerable entities in a smart grid, failure of
which can maximize the network damage. Owing to the problem being NP complete,
an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based solution is given here. Validation of
the model [1] and the results of the ILP based solution is done by simulating a
smart grid system of IEEE 14-Bus using MATPOWER and Java Network Simulator

also it can predict the network damage for failure of K-most vulnerable

that every element can be approximated by linear combinations of idempotents.
This particularly implies that these $L^1$-algebras are weakly amenable (i. e.,
every bounded derivation into the dual module is an inner derivation), which is
known to be shared by any $L^1$-algebra of a locally compact group; in the

when the inner regions of the disc are illuminated by the corona are subject to
strong gravitational light bending, causing up to 47 per cent of the reflected
emission to be returned to the disc around a rapidly spinning black hole,
depending upon the scale height of the corona. The iron K line is enhanced
relative to the continuum by 25 per cent, and the Compton hump by up to a
factor of three. Additional light travel time between primary and secondary
reflections increases the reverberation time lag measured in the iron K band by
49 per cent, while the soft X-ray lag is increased by 25 per cent and the
Compton hump response time is increased by 60 per cent. Measured samples of
X-ray reverberation lags are shown to be consistent with X-rays returning to
the accretion disc in strong gravity. Understanding the effects of returning
radiation is important in interpreting reverberation observations to probe
black holes. Reflected X-rays returning to the disc can be uniquely identified
by blueshifted returning iron K line photons that are Compton scattered from

even when the binary is circular. Here we demonstrate that, in steady state,
the disk's eccentricity behaves as a long-lived free mode trapped by turning
points that naturally arise from a continuously truncated density profile.
Consequently, both the disk's precession rate and eccentricity profile may be
calculated via the simple linear theory for perturbed pressure-supported disks.
By formulating and solving the linear theory we find that (i) surprisingly, the
precession rate is roughly determined by the binary's quadrupole, even when the
quadrupole is very weak relative to pressure; (ii) the eccentricity profile is
largest near the inner edge of the disk, and falls exponentially outwards; and
(iii) the results from linear theory indeed agree with what is found in
simulations. Understanding the development of eccentric modes in circumbinary
disks is a crucial first step for understanding the long term (secular)
exchange of eccentricity, angular momentum and mass between the binary and the

signature in disks around candidate binaries and precession-induced modulation
of accretion over long timescales.

approximate methods for neutrino transport that do not converge to a solution
of the transport equations as numerical resolution increases, and thus have
errors that are impossible to quantify. Here, we report on a first simulation
of a binary neutron star merger that uses Monte-Carlo techniques to directly
solve the transport equations in low-density regions. In high-density regions,
we use approximations inspired by implicit Monte-Carlo to greatly reduce the
cost of simulations, while only introducing errors quantifiable through more
expensive convergence studies. We simulate an unequal mass neutron star binary
merger up to $5\,{\rm ms}$ past merger, and report on the properties of the
matter and neutrino outflows. Finally, we compare our results to the output of
our best approximate `M1' transport scheme, demonstrating that an M1 scheme
that carefully approximates the neutrino energy spectrum only leads to $\sim
10\%$ uncertainty in the composition and velocity of the ejecta, and $\sim20\%$
uncertainty in the $\nu_e$ and $\bar\nu_e$ luminosities and energies. The most
significant disagreement found between M1 and Monte-Carlo results is a factor
of $\sim 2$ difference in the luminosity of heavy-lepton neutrinos.

a combination of dynamical heating from mergers and a mild ($J_{\rm LW} \sim 2

massive stars form with stellar masses greater than 1000 M$_{\odot}$. The most
massive star has a stellar mass of over 6000 M$_{\odot}$. However, accretion
onto all stars declines significantly after the first $\sim$ 100 kyr of
evolution as the surrounding material is accreted and the turbulent nature of
the gas causes the stars to move to lower density regions. We post-process the
impact of ionising radiation from the stars and find that ionising radiation is
not a limiting factor when considering SMS formation and growth. Rather the
birth environments are highly turbulent and a steady accretion flow is not
maintained within the timescale (2 Myr) of our simulations. As the massive
stars end their lives as direct collapse black holes this will seed these
embryonic haloes with a population of black holes with masses between
approximately 300 M$_{\odot}$ and 10,000 M$_{\odot}$. Afterwards they may sink
to the centre of the haloes, eventually coalescing to form larger intermediate
mass black holes whose in-situ mergers will be detectable by LISA.

used to study the conditions necessary for the formation of massive stars. NGC
2770 was dubbed a SN factory, because it hosted four core-collapse SNe in 20
years (three type Ib and one type IIn). Its star formation rate (SFR) was
reported not to be enhanced and therefore not compatible with such a high SN
rate. We aim at explaining the high SN rate of NGC 2770. We used archival HI
line data for NGC 2770 and reinterpret the Halpha and optical continuum data.
Even though the continuum-based SFR indicators do not yield high values, the
dust-corrected Halpha luminosity implies a high SFR, consistent with the high
SN rate. Such disparity between the SFR estimators is an indication of recently
enhanced star formation activity, because the continuum indicators trace long
timescale of the order of 100 Myr, unlike the line indicators, which trace
timescales of the order of 10 Myr. Hence, the unique feature of NGC 2770
compared to other galaxies is the fact that it is observed very recently after
the enhancement of the SFR. It also has high dust extinction, E(B-V) above 1
mag. We provide support for the hypothesis that the increased SFR in NGC 2770
is due to the interaction with its companion galaxies. We report an HI bridge
between NGC 2770 and its closest companion and the existence of a total of four
companions within 100 kpc (one identified for the first time). There are no
clear HI concentrations close to the positions of SNe in NGC 2770 such as those
detected for hosts of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and broad-lined SNe type Ic
(IcBL). This suggests that the progenitors of type Ib SNe are not born out of
recently accreted atomic gas, as was suggested for GRB and IcBL SN progenitors.

$R^{14}_{\rm CGM} = 177_{-65}^{+70}$ kpc and extend to $R^{14}_{\rm CGM} \simeq

the dynamical (broadening and velocity) parameters from a set of 5 emission
lines (e.g. H{\alpha}, N[II] doublet, and S[II] doublet) in the SN3 (651-685

observations in the SIGNALS program of one of the South West fields of M33. The
CNN recovers the dynamical parameters with an accuracy better than 5 km s-1 in
regions with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 15 over the H{\alpha}line.
More importantly, our CNN method reduces calculation time by over an order of

machine learning algorithms for the use in future IFU-based missions.

preserving beneficial squeezing at higher frequencies. This is called an
amplitude filter cavity, and it is useful for avoiding degradation of detector

the range of 100--2500 days in eccentric orbits. They are surrounded by
circumbinary dusty discs. They are the immediate result of unconstrained binary
interaction processes. Their observed orbital properties do not correspond to
model predictions: Neither the periods nor the high eccentricities are
expected. Our goal is to investigate if interactions between a binary and its
circumbinary disc during the post-AGB phase can result in their eccentric
orbits, while simultaneously explaining the chemical anomaly known as
depletion. For this paper, we selected three binaries (EP Lyr, RU Cen, HD
46703) with well-constrained orbits, luminosities, and chemical abundances. We
used the MESA code to evolve post-AGB models, while including the accretion of
metal-poor gas. This allows us to constrain the evolution of the stars and
study the impact of circumbinary discs on the orbital properties of the models.
We investigate the effect of torques produced by gas inside the binary cavity
and the effect of Lindblad resonances on the orbit, while also including the
tidal interaction following the equilibrium tide model. We find that none of
our models are able to explain the high orbital eccentricities of the binaries
in our sample. The accretion torque does not significantly impact the binary
orbit, while Lindblad resonances can pump the eccentricity up to only $e
\approx 0.2$. At higher eccentricities, the tidal interaction becomes too
strong, so the high observed eccentricities cannot be reproduced. However, even
if we assume tides to be ineffective, the eccentricities in our models do not
exceed $\approx 0.25$. We conclude that either our knowledge of disc-binary
interactions is still incomplete, or the binaries must have left their phase of
strong interaction in an eccentric orbit.

(~14 Mpc) type-2 AGN NGC 1068 at HCN/HCO+/HNC J=3-2 lines, as well as at their
13C isotopologue and vibrationally excited lines, to scrutinize the
morphological/dynamical/chemical/physical properties of dense molecular gas in
the putative dusty molecular torus around a mass-accreting supermassive black
hole. We confirm almost east-west-oriented dense molecular gas emission both
morphologically and dynamically, which we regard as coming from the torus.
Bright emission is compact (<3 pc), and low-surface-brightness emission extends
out to 5-7 pc. These dense molecular gas properties are not symmetric between
the eastern and western torus. The HCN J=3-2 emission is stronger than the HCO+
J=3-2 emission within the ~7 pc torus region, with an estimated dense molecular
mass of (0.4-1.0)x10^6Msun. We interpret that HCN abundance is enhanced in the
torus. We detect signatures of outflowing dense molecular gas and a
vibrationally excited HCN J=3-2 line. Finally, we find that in the innermost
(<1 pc) part of the torus, the dense molecular line rotation velocity, relative
to the systemic velocity, is the opposite of that in the outer (>2 pc) part, in
both the eastern and western torus. We prefer a scenario of counter-rotating
dense molecular gas with innermost almost-Keplerian-rotation and outer slowly
rotating (far below Keplerian) components. Our high-spatial-resolution dense
molecular line data reveal that torus properties of NGC 1068 are much more
complicated than the simple axi-symmetrically rotating torus picture in the
classical AGN unification paradigm.

young disks that are still embedded in their natal envelope (Class 0 and I) are
predicted to be too warm for CO to freeze out, as has been confirmed
observationally for L1527 IRS. To establish whether young disks are generally
warmer than their more evolved counterparts, we observed five young (Class 0/I
and Class I) disks in Taurus with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA), targeting C$^{17}$O $2-1$, H$_2$CO $3_{1,2}-2_{1,1}$, HDO
$3_{1,2}-2_{2,1}$ and CH$_3$OH $5_K-4_K$ transitions at $0.48^{\prime\prime}
\times 0.31^{\prime\prime}$ resolution. The different freeze-out temperatures
of these species allow us to derive a global temperature structure. C$^{17}$O
and H$_2$CO are detected in all disks, with no signs of CO freeze-out in the
inner $\sim$100 au, and a CO abundance close to $\sim$10$^{-4}$. H$_2$CO
emission originates in the surface layers of the two edge-on disks, as
witnessed by the especially beautiful V-shaped emission pattern in
IRAS~04302+2247. HDO and CH$_3$OH are not detected, with column density upper
limits more than 100 times lower than for hot cores. Young disks are thus found
to be warmer than more evolved protoplanetary disks around solar analogues,
with no CO freeze-out (or only in the outermost part of $\gtrsim$100 au disks)
or CO processing. However, they are not as warm as hot cores or disks around
outbursting sources, and therefore do not have a large gas-phase reservoir of

used to compute the solution at a new time level from a number of simpler

splitting schemes are based on one or another additive splitting of the
operator into ""simpler"" operators that are more convenient/easier for the
computer implementation and use inhomogeneous (explicitly-implicit) time
approximations. In this paper, a new class of splitting schemes is proposed
that is characterized by an additive representation of the solution instead of
the operator corresponding to the problem (called problem operator). A specific
feature of the proposed splitting is that the resulting coupled equations for
individual solution components consist of the time derivatives of the solution
components. The proposed approaches are motivated by various applications,
including multiscale methods, domain decomposition, and so on, where spatially
local problems are solved and used to compute the solution. Unconditionally
stable splitting schemes are constructed for a first-order evolution equation,
which is considered in a finite-dimensional Hilbert space. In our splitting
algorithms, we consider the decomposition of both the main operator of the

general framework that combines temporal splitting algorithms and spatial
decomposition and its analysis. Applications of the framework will be studied

important role in obtaining benefits from EA, but that they generally benefit
less than the organization as a whole.

by the lack of a general theory of the phenomena. This article presents such a
theory for two electrical spin-resonance techniques, electrically detected
magnetic resonance (EDMR) and the recently observed near-zero field
magnetoresistance (NZFMR), by generalizing Shockley Read Hall trap-assisted
recombination current calculations via stochastic Liouville equations. Spin
mixing at this dielectric interface occurs via the hyperfine interaction, which
we show can be treated either quantum mechanically or semiclassically, yielding
distinctive differences in the current across the interface. By analyzing the
bias dependence of NZFMR and EDMR, we find that the recombination in a
Si/SiO$_2$ MOSFET is well understood within a semiclassical approach.

images and perform poorly in regions with reflective objects, shadows,
ill-conditioned light environment and so on. LiDAR measurements are much less

detector of non-variability. In order to test these results under controlled

Earth have given evidence of an unusual reconnection mechanism that is driven
exclusively by electrons. This newly observed process was called electron-only
reconnection, and its inter-play with plasma turbulence is a matter of great
debate.
  Aims: By using 2D-3V hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell simulations of freely decaying
plasma turbulence, we study the role of electron-only reconnection in the
development of plasma turbulence. In particular, we search for possible
differences with respect to the turbulence associated with standard ion-coupled
reconnection.
  Methods: We analyzed the structure functions of the turbulent magnetic field
and ion fluid velocity fluctuations to characterize the structure and the
intermittency properties of the turbulent energy cascade.
  Results: We find that the statistical properties of turbulent fluctuations
associated with electron-only reconnection are consistent with those of
turbulent fluctuations associated with standard ion-coupled reconnection, and
no peculiar signature related to electron-only reconnection is found in the
turbulence statistics. This result suggests that the turbulent energy cascade
in a collisionless magnetized plasma does not depend on the specific mechanism
associated with magnetic reconnection. The properties of the dissipation range
are discussed as well, and we claim that only electrons contribute to the
dissipation of magnetic field energy at sub-ion scales.

protocol to a multi-user system, where we derive minimum mean squared error
(MMSE) estimates of all IRS-assisted channels over multiple sub-phases. We also
consider a low-complexity direct estimation (DE) scheme, where the BS obtains
the MMSE estimate of the overall channel in a single sub-phase. Under both
protocols, the BS implements maximum ratio transmission (MRT) precoding while
the IRS design is studied in the large system limit, where we derive
deterministic equivalents of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
and the sum-rate. The derived asymptotic expressions, which depend only on
channel statistics, reveal that under Rayleigh fading IRS-to-users channels,
the IRS phase-shift values do not play a significant role in improving the
sum-rate but the IRS still provides an array gain. Simulation results confirm
the accuracy of the derived deterministic equivalents and show that under
Rayleigh fading, the IRS gains are more significant in noise-limited scenarios.
We also conclude that the DE of the overall channel yields better performance
when considering large systems.

learning techniques, infection data at a country level to a single number that
signifies social distancing effectiveness. We assume that the standard SIR
model gives a reasonable description of the dynamics of spreading, and thus the
social distancing aspect can be modeled through time-dependent infection rates
that are imposed externally. We use an exponential ansatz to analyze the SIR
model, find an exact solution for the time-independent infection rate, and
derive a simple first-order differential equation for the time-dependent
infection rate as a function of the infected population. Using infected number
data from the ""first wave"" of the infection from eight countries, and through
physics-informed machine learning, we extract the degree of linear dependence
in social distancing that led to the specific infections. We find that in the
two extremes are Greece, with the highest decay slope on one side, and the US
on the other with a practically flat ""decay"". The hierarchy of slopes is
compatible with the effectiveness of the pandemic containment in each country.

simulations to gauge the influence of survey geometry, cosmic variance,
redshift space distortions, redshift evolution, cosmological parameters and
spatial number density. Cosmic variance shows the least important influence

cosmological parameters and redshift evolution produce larger changes on the

changes in the number density of clustered points. As the number density
decreases, and the cosmic web is less pronounced, the entropy can diminish up

performances of musicians are getting traction on massive multiplayer online
worlds. However, well choreographed dance movements are extremely complex to
animate and would involve an expensive and tedious production process. In
addition to the use of complex motion capture systems, it typically requires a
collaborative effort between animators, dancers, and choreographers. We
introduce a complete system for dance motion synthesis, which can generate
complex and highly diverse dance sequences given an input music sequence. As
motion capture data is limited for the range of dance motions and styles, we
introduce a massive dance motion data set that is created from YouTube videos.
We also present a novel two-stream motion transformer generative model, which
can generate motion sequences with high flexibility. We also introduce new
evaluation metrics for the quality of synthesized dance motions, and
demonstrate that our system can outperform state-of-the-art methods. Our system
provides high-quality animations suitable for large crowds for virtual concerts
and can also be used as reference for professional animation pipelines. Most
importantly, we show that vast online videos can be effective in training dance

promising candidate for satisfying increasing data storage needs. Compared to
conventional storage media, however, data stored in DNA is subject to a wider
range of errors resulting from various processes involved in the data storage
pipeline. In this paper, we consider correcting duplication errors for both
exact and noisy tandem duplications of a given length k. An exact duplication
inserts a copy of a substring of length k of the sequence immediately after
that substring, e.g., ACGT to ACGACGT, where k = 3, while a noisy duplication
inserts a copy suffering from substitution noise, e.g., ACGT to ACGATGT.
Specifically, we design codes that can correct any number of exact duplication
and one noisy duplication errors, where in the noisy duplication case the copy
is at Hamming distance 1 from the original. Our constructions rely upon
recovering the duplication root of the stored codeword. We characterize the
ways in which duplication errors manifest in the root of affected sequences and
design efficient codes for correcting these error patterns. We show that the
proposed construction is asymptotically optimal, in the sense that it has the

canonical symplectic structure. Numerical integrators designed for the
canonical structure are incompatible with motion generated by non-canonical

symplectic geometry, correspond to techniques such as preconditioning which are
routinely used to improve algorithmic performance. Indeed, recently, a special
case of non-canonical structure, magnetic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, was
demonstrated to provide advantageous sampling properties. We present a
framework for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo using non-canonical symplectic

to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with non-canonical structure. To summarize our
contributions: (i) we develop non-canonical HMC from foundations in symplectic
geomtry; (ii) we construct an HMC procedure using implicit integration that
satisfies the detailed balance; (iii) we propose to accelerate the sampling

EXCLUVIS (gene EXpression data CLUstering and VISualization) has been developed
using MATLAB Graphical User Interface (GUI) environment for analyzing the
performances of different clustering algorithms on gene expression datasets. In
this application package, the user needs to select a number of parameters such
as internal validity indices, external validity indices and number of clusters
from the active windows for evaluating the performance of the clustering
algorithms. EXCLUVIS compares the performances of K-means, fuzzy C-means,
hierarchical clustering and multiobjective evolutionary clustering algorithms.
Heatmap and cluster profile plots are used for visualizing the results.

relied on detection of region-of-interest as a pre-requisite for shape

for further analyses. Although state-of-the-art methods (e.g., U-Net) have
achieved decent performance on cardiac image segmentation in terms of accuracy,
these segmentation results can still suffer from imaging artifacts and noise,

a PC-U net that jointly reconstructs the point cloud of the LV MYO wall
directly from volumes of 2D CT slices and generates its segmentation masks from

evolve, the computational cost of such peak detection and shape fitting becomes
the biggest hurdle to the rapid analysis required for real-time feedback during

method that can determine peak positions much more rapidly than conventional
pseudo-Voigt peak fitting. When applied to a test dataset, BraggNN gives errors
of less than 0.29 and 0.57 pixels, relative to the conventional method, for 75%

dataset, a 3D reconstruction that used peak positions computed by BraggNN
yields 15% better results on average as compared to a reconstruction obtained
using peak positions determined using conventional 2D pseudo-Voigt fitting.
Recent advances in deep learning method implementations and special-purpose

threshold2 on the system's performance is not fully understood. These
parameters are fixed to a gold standard value or adjusted through hit and
trial. This paper presents a first study to analyze and optimize A5 parameters
for jointly maximizing two key performance indicators (KPIs): Reference signal
received power (RSRP) and handover success rate (HOSR). As analytical modeling
cannot capture the system-level complexity, a data driven approach is used. By
developing XGBoost based model, that outperforms other models in terms of
accuracy, we first analyze the concurrent impact of the three parameters on the
two KPIs. The results reveal three key insights: 1) there exist optimal
parameter values for each KPI; 2) these optimal values do not necessarily
belong to the current gold standard; 3) the optimal parameter values for the
two KPIs do not overlap. We then leverage the Sobol variance-based sensitivity
analysis to draw some insights which can be used to avoid the parametric
conflict while jointly maximizing both KPIs. We formulate the joint RSRP and
HOSR optimization problem, show that it is non-convex and solve it using the
genetic algorithm (GA). Comparison with the brute force-based results show that
the proposed data driven GA-aided solution is 48x faster with negligible loss

for the spread of disease and its application to the COVID-19 epidemic. First
unconstrained methods are revisited and they are shown to correspond to the
application of a linear filter followed by a nonlinear estimate of the
effective reproduction number after a change-of-coordinates. Unconstrained
methods often fail to keep the estimated variables within their physical range
and can lead to unreliable estimates that require aggressively smoothing the
raw data. In order to overcome these shortcomings a constrained estimation
method is proposed that keeps the model variables within pre-specified
boundaries and can also promote smoothness of the estimates. Constrained
estimation can be directly applied to raw data without the need of
pre-smoothing and the associated loss of information and additional lag. It can
also be easily extended to handle additional information, such as the number of
infected individuals. The resulting problem is cast as a convex quadratic
optimization problem with linear and convex quadratic constraints. It is also
shown that both unconstrained and constrained methods when applied to death
data are independent of the fatality rate. The methods are applied to public
death data from the COVID-19 epidemic.

iterative process with potentially high inter-planner variability. Fully
automated treatment planning processes could reduce a planner's active
treatment planning time and remove inter-planner variability, with the
potential to tremendously improve patient turnover and quality of care. In
developing fully automated algorithms for treatment planning, we have two main
objectives: to produce plans that are 1) Pareto optimal and 2) clinically
acceptable. Here, we propose the Pareto optimal projection search (POPS)
algorithm, which provides a general framework for directly searching the Pareto
front. Methods: Our POPS algorithm is a novel automated planning method that
combines two main search processes: 1) gradient-free search in the decision
variable space and 2) projection of decision variables to the Pareto front
using the bisection method. We demonstrate the performance of POPS by comparing
with clinical treatment plans. As one possible quantitative measure of
treatment plan quality, we construct a clinical acceptability scoring function
(SF) modified from the previously developed general evaluation metric (GEM).
Results: On a dataset of 21 prostate cases collected as part of clinical
workflow, our proposed POPS algorithm produces Pareto optimal plans that are
clinically acceptable in regards to dose conformity, dose homogeneity, and
sparing of organs-at-risk. Conclusion: Our proposed POPS algorithm provides a

  Transactions",,,,,"cs.DC cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The state-of-the-art techniques for processing cross-blockchain transactions
take a simple centralized approach: when the assets on blockchain $X$, say
$X$-coins, are exchanged with the assets on blockchain $Y$---the $Y$-coins,
those $X$-coins need to be exchanged to a ""middle"" medium (such as Bitcoin)
that is then exchanged to $Y$-coins. If there are more than two parties
involved in a single global transaction, the global transaction is split into
multiple local two-party transactions, each of which follows the above
central-exchange protocol. Unfortunately, the atomicity of the global
transaction is violated with the central-exchange approach: those local
two-party transactions, once committed, cannot be rolled back if the global
transaction decides to abort. In a more general sense, the graph-based model of
(two-party) transactions can hardly be extended to an arbitrary number of
parties in a cross-blockchain transaction. %from why to how In this paper, we
introduce a higher-level abstraction of cross-blockchain transactions. We adopt
the \textit{abstract simplicial complex}, an extensively-studied mathematical
object in algebraic topology, to represent an arbitrary number of parties
involved in the blockchain transactions. Essentially, each party in the global
transaction is modeled as a vertex and the global transaction among $n+1$ ($n
\in \mathbb{Z}$, $n > 0$) parties compose a $n$-dimensional simplex. While this
higher-level abstraction seems plausibly trivial, we will show how this simple
extension leads to a new line of modeling methods and protocols for better
processing cross-blockchain transactions.

superexchange, which relates to whether cuprate-like high-temperature nickelate
superconductivity could be realized. We address this question using Ni L-edge
and O K-edge spectroscopy of the reduced trilayer nickelate $d^{9-1/3}$
La4Ni3O8 and associated theoretical modeling. A magnon energy scale of ~80 meV
resulting from a nearest-neighbor magnetic exchange of $J = 69(4)4$ meV is
observed, proving that $d^{9-{\delta}}$ nickelates can host a large
superexchange. This value, along with that of the Ni-O hybridization estimated
from our O K-edge data, implies that trilayer nickelates represent an
intermediate case between the infinite-layer nickelates and the cuprates, and
suggests that they represent a promising route towards higher-temperature
nickelate superconductivity.

excitation-induced dephasing effects on time-resolved two-dimensional coherent
optical lineshapes and we identify a number of features that can be attributed
to the many-body dynamics occurring in the background of the exciton, including
dynamic line narrowing, mixing of real and imaginary spectral components, and
multi-quantum states. We test the model by means of multidimensional coherent
spectroscopy on a two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductor that hosts tightly
bound excitons and biexcitons that feature strong polaronic character. We find
that the exciton nonlinear coherent lineshape reflects many-body correlations
that give rise to excitation-induced dephasing. Furthermore, we observe that
the exciton lineshape evolves with population time over time windows in which
the population itself is static, in a manner that reveals the evolution of the
multi-exciton many-body couplings. Specifically, the dephasing dynamics slow
down with time, at a rate that is governed by the strength of exciton many-body
interactions and on the dynamic Coulomb screening potential. The real part of
the coherent optical lineshape displays strong dispersive character at zero
time, which transforms to an absorptive lineshape on the dissipation timescale
of excitation-induced dephasing effects, while the imaginary part displays
converse behavior. Our microscopic theoretical approach is sufficiently
flexible to allow for a wide exploration of how system-bath dynamics contribute

to achieve better coverage and higher capacity for future wireless network by
exploiting the more favorable line-of-sight (LoS) propagation. To reap the
potential gains of UAV swarm, the remote control signal sent by ground control
unit (GCU) is essential, whereas the control signal quality are susceptible in
practice due to the effect of the adjacent channel interference (ACI) and the
external interference (EI) from radiation sources distributed across the
region. To tackle these challenges, this paper considers priority-aware
resource coordination in a multi-UAV communication system, where multiple UAVs
are controlled by a GCU to perform certain tasks with a pre-defined trajectory.
Specifically, we maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio
(SINR) among all the UAVs by jointly optimizing channel assignment and power
allocation strategy under stringent resource availability constraints.
According to the intensity of ACI, we consider the corresponding problem in two
scenarios, i.e., Null-ACI and ACI systems. By virtue of the particular problem
structure in Null-ACI case, we first recast the formulation into an equivalent
yet more tractable form and obtain the global optimal solution via Hungarian
algorithm. For general ACI systems, we develop an efficient iterative algorithm
for its solution based on the smooth approximation and alternating optimization
methods. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms
can significantly enhance the minimum SINR among all the UAVs and adapt the
allocation of communication resources to diverse mission priority.

its major landmarks and pathways. We first provide an overview of the different
ML categories and sub-categories or tasks, and we note several of the

opportunities to solve important challenges in reliability and safety

""structural"" properties of the functions. For example, if a given function is
non-negative, a polynomial approximation of the function is not necessarily
also non-negative. We propose a formalism and algorithms for preserving certain
types of such structure in function approximation. In particular, we consider
structure corresponding to a convex constraint on the approximant (for which
positivity is one example). The approximation problem then converts into a
convex feasibility problem, but the feasible set is relatively complicated so
that standard convex feasibility algorithms cannot be directly applied. We
propose and discuss different algorithms for solving this problem. One of the
features of our machinery is flexibility: relatively complicated constraints,
such as simultaneously enforcing positivity, monotonicity, and convexity, are
fairly straightforward to implement. We demonstrate the success of our
algorithm on several problems in univariate function approximation.

This is complementary to previous works which rely on audio or video post

victim, perpetrator and narrator) based on the demographics of the actor casted
for that role. Our results highlight two significant differences in the
frequency of portrayals as well as the demographics of the interaction between
victims and perpetrators : (1) female characters appear more often as victims,
and (2) perpetrators are more likely to be White if the victim is Black or
Latino. To date, we are the first to show that language used in movie scripts

portrayals of certain demographics as victims and perpetrators in a large

bipartite lattice exhibits a set of flat bands and a set of dispersive bands.
The flat band connects to the dispersive bands through a degenerate state at
some momentum. We find that, with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the flat band
becomes quasi-flat and gapped from the dispersive bands. By studying a series
of specific line graphs and split graphs of bipartite lattices, we find that
(i) if the flat band (without SOC) has inversion or $C_2$ symmetry and is
non-degenerate, then the resulting quasi-flat band must be topologically
nontrivial, and (ii) if the flat band (without SOC) is degenerate, then there
exists an SOC potential such that the resulting quasi-flat band is
topologically nontrivial. This generic mechanism serves as a paradigm for
finding topological quasi-flat bands in 2D crystalline materials and

with several viscosities and 2-methoxyethanol aqueous solutions, which are
acidic solutions, with several concentrations. This result demonstrated that
the star shaped pattern emerged in the high concentration of 2-methoxyethanol.
We proposed a phenomenological model, based on our experimental results, which
explains three points as follows; the spreading of the 2-methoxyethanol aqueous
solution on the surface of the glycerol solution, the colloidal aggregation of
the milk protein colloids caused by the denaturation that occurs when mixed
with 2-methoxyethanol, and the accumulation of the aggregates toward the dent
regions of the moving interface by a sweeping effect. The model reproduces the
formation of the star shaped pattern which was similar to the experimental one.
Furthermore, the model provided a phase diagram against the concentration of
the 2-methoxyethanol solution and the viscosity of the glycerol solution as
control parameters in our experiments. The phase diagram was close to that
obtained from our experiments. The results suggest that the above three points
are important for the formation of the star shaped pattern.

normal modes called the drumhead modes, which can be used to implement a range
of quantum information protocols. However, experimental observations of
crystals with Doppler-cooled and even near-ground-state-cooled drumhead modes
reveal an unresolved drumhead mode spectrum. In this work, we establish
in-plane thermal fluctuations in ion positions as a major contributor to the

the confining magnetic field leads to unconventional in-plane normal modes,
whose average potential and kinetic energies are not equal. This property, in

intensive computation--not only sensing and planning, but also low-level
whole-body control--to remote servers in order to reduce on-board computational
needs. Fifth Generation (5G) wireless cellular technology, with its low latency

performance control of complex robots. However, state-of-the-art control
algorithms for legged robots can only tolerate very low control delays, which
even ultra-low latency 5G edge computing can sometimes fail to achieve. In this
work, we investigate the problem of cloud-based whole-body control of legged
robots over a 5G link. We propose a novel approach that consists of a standard
optimization-based controller on the network edge and a local linear,
approximately optimal controller that significantly reduces on-board

  arXiv:1901.03264v4",,,,"math.ST stat.ML stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Introduced by Kiefer and Wolfowitz \cite{KW56}, the nonparametric maximum
likelihood estimator (NPMLE) is a widely used methodology for learning mixture
odels and empirical Bayes estimation. Sidestepping the non-convexity in mixture
likelihood, the NPMLE estimates the mixing distribution by maximizing the total
likelihood over the space of probability measures, which can be viewed as an
extreme form of overparameterization.
  In this paper we discover a surprising property of the NPMLE solution.
Consider, for example, a Gaussian mixture model on the real line with a
subgaussian mixing distribution. Leveraging complex-analytic techniques, we
show that with high probability the NPMLE based on a sample of size $n$ has
$O(\log n)$ atoms (mass points), significantly improving the deterministic
upper bound of $n$ due to Lindsay \cite{lindsay1983geometry1}. Notably, any
such Gaussian mixture is statistically indistinguishable from a finite one with
$O(\log n)$ components (and this is tight for certain mixtures). Thus, absent
any explicit form of model selection, NPMLE automatically chooses the right
model complexity, a property we term \emph{self-regularization}. Extensions to
other exponential families are given. As a statistical application, we show
that this structural property can be harnessed to bootstrap existing Hellinger
risk bound of the (parametric) MLE for finite Gaussian mixtures to the NPMLE
for general Gaussian mixtures, recovering a result of Zhang
\cite{zhang2009generalized}.

June-September every year, is very heterogeneous in space and time. We study
the relationship between rainfall and Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR,
convective cloud cover) for monsoon between 2004-2010. To identify, classify
and visualize spatial patterns of rainfall and OLR we use a discrete and
spatio-temporally coherent representation of the data, created using a
statistical model based on Markov Random Field. Our approach clusters the days
with similar spatial distributions of rainfall and OLR into a small number of
spatial patterns. We find that eight daily spatial patterns each in rainfall
and OLR, and seven joint patterns of rainfall and OLR, describe over 90\% of
all days. Through these patterns, we find that OLR generally has a strong
negative correlation with precipitation, but with significant spatial
variations. In particular, peninsular India (except west coast) is under
significant convective cloud cover over a majority of days but remains
rainless. We also find that much of the monsoon rainfall co-occurs with low
OLR, but some amount of rainfall in Eastern and North-western India in June
occurs on OLR days, presumably from shallow clouds. To study day-to-day
variations of both quantities, we identify spatial patterns in the temporal
gradients computed from the observations. We find that changes in convective
cloud activity across India most commonly occur due to the establishment of a
north-south OLR gradient which persists for 1-2 days and shifts the convective
cloud cover from light to deep or vice versa. Such changes are also accompanied
by changes in the spatial distribution of precipitation. The present work thus
provides a highly reduced description of the complex spatial patterns and their
day-to-day variations, and could form a useful tool for future simplified
descriptions of this process.

blocks. The urgency of using arbitrary shapes application cutting from
honey-comb blocks made of modern composite materials is substantiated. The
problem is to obtain a cut of the given shape from honeycomb blocks. The
complexity of this problem is in the irregular pattern of honeycomb blocks and
the presence of double edges, which forces an operator to scan each block
before cutting. It is necessary to take into account such restrictions as the
place and angle of the cut and size of the knife, its angle when cutting and
the geometry of cells. For this problem solving, a robotic complex has been
developed. It includes a device for scanning the geometry of a honeycomb block,
software for cutting automation and a cutting device itself. The software takes
into account all restrictions on the choice of the location and angle of the
operating mechanism. It helps to obtain the highest quality cut and a cut shape
with the best strength characteristics. An actu-ating device has been developed
and implemented for both scanning and cutting of honeycomb blocks directly. The
necessary tests were carried out on real alu-minum honeycomb blocks. Some
technical solutions are used in the cutting de-vice to improve the quality of
cutting honeycomb blocks. The tests have shown the effectiveness of the
proposed complex. Robotic planar cutting made it possi-ble to obtain precise
cutting with a high degree of repeatability.

MLIR concept of dialects to implement its functionality. We propose here two
new dialects: (1) an ONNX specific dialect that encodes the ONNX standard
semantics, and (2) a loop-based dialect to provide for a common lowering point
for all ONNX dialect operations. Each intermediate representation facilitates
its own characteristic set of graph-level and loop-based optimizations
respectively. We illustrate our approach by following several models through
the proposed representations and we include some early optimization work and
performance results.

performance in sequential recommendation task. Following the custom from

limitations regarding the current approaches. First, sequential recommendation
is different from language processing in that timestamp information is
available. Previous models have not made good use of it to extract additional
contextual information. Second, using a simple embedding scheme can lead to
information bottleneck since the same embedding has to represent all possible
contextual biases. Third, since previous models use the same positional
embedding in each attention head, they can wastefully learn overlapping

This policy is inherently challenging to analyze because the recursion induces
propagation of the estimation error backwards in time. In this work, we
establish the asymptotic properties of this data-driven policy by fully
accounting for the error propagation. First, we rigorously show the consistency

propagation) in the existing studies. In this setting, empirical process theory
(EPT) cannot be directly applied to show asymptotic normality. To explain, the
empirical cost-to-go functions for the estimated parameters are not i.i.d. sums

asymptotic representation for multi-sample U-processes in terms of i.i.d. sums.
This representation enables us to apply EPT to derive the influence functions
of the estimated parameters and to establish joint asymptotic normality. Based
on these results, we also propose an entirely data-driven estimator of the
optimal expected cost and we derive its asymptotic distribution. We demonstrate

dermoscopic images. In the last few years, deep learning based semantic
segmentation methods have significantly advanced the skin lesion segmentation
results. However, the current performance is still unsatisfactory due to some
challenging factors such as large variety of lesion scale and ambiguous
difference between lesion region and background. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective framework, named Dual Objective Networks (DONet), to
improve the skin lesion segmentation. Our DONet adopts two symmetric decoders
to produce different predictions for approaching different objectives.
Concretely, the two objectives are actually defined by different loss
functions. In this way, the two decoders are encouraged to produce
differentiated probability maps to match different optimization targets,
resulting in complementary predictions accordingly. The complementary
information learned by these two objectives are further aggregated together to
make the final prediction, by which the uncertainty existing in segmentation
maps can be significantly alleviated. Besides, to address the challenge of
large variety of lesion scales and shapes in dermoscopic images, we
additionally propose a recurrent context encoding module (RCEM) to model the
complex correlation among skin lesions, where the features with different scale
contexts are efficiently integrated to form a more robust representation.
Extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks well demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed DONet. In particular, our DONet achieves 0.881

presence of noise in the ultrasound images, they can be confused with noise.
Suboptimal images can sometimes lead to surgical errors where the surgeon may
cut the blood vessel in error. The ultrasound system is versatile and portable
and has the advantage of being able to be used in the operating theatre. Due to
the nature of B-mode ultrasound, 1-D transfer function volume visualization of

function improves the ability to define features of interest, the high
dimensionality in the parameter domain renders it unwieldy and difficult for
clinicians to work with. To overcome these limitations, an algorithm for volume

ultrasound images, which can be useful for clinicians, is proposed. We propose
a method that is appropriate for liver ultrasound images focusing on vessels

redundancy of neural network weights and activations. Recent paper proposes to
use Hessian traces of weights and activations for mixed-precision quantization

selecting bits for each layer while the redundancy of different channels within
a layer also differ a lot. This is mainly because the complexity of determining
bits for each channel is too high for original methods. Here, we introduce
Channel-wise Hessian Aware trace-Weighted Quantization (CW-HAWQ). CW-HAWQ uses
Hessian trace to determine the relative sensitivity order of different channels
of activations and weights. What's more, CW-HAWQ proposes to use deep
Reinforcement learning (DRL) Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)-based
agent to find the optimal ratios of different quantization bits and assign bits
to channels according to the Hessian trace order. The number of states in
CW-HAWQ is much smaller compared with traditional AutoML based mix-precision

CW-HAWQ with state-of-the-art shows that we can achieve better results for

latency due to synchronization and data transfer among workers negatively

curvature, we find that for low electric potential, the attractive interaction
dominates among the microstructures, while a high electric potential produces
repulsive interactions. In the reduced parameter space, we observe that only
attractive interaction is allowed when the coexistence region is excluded. The
normalized scalar curvature also admits a critical exponent 2 and a universal
constant $-\frac{1}{8}$. In particular, the value of the normalized scalar
curvature keeps the same along the coexistence small and large black hole

usually cannot touch or try products before purchasing, which means that they
have to make decisions when they are uncertain about the outcome (e.g.,
satisfaction level) of purchasing a product. To study people's preferences,
economics researchers have proposed the hypothesis of Expected Utility (EU)
that models the subject value associated with an individual's choice as the
statistical expectations of that individual's valuations of the outcomes of
this choice. Despite its success in studies of game theory and decision theory,
the effectiveness of EU, however, is mostly unknown in e-commerce
recommendation systems. Previous research on e-commerce recommendation
interprets the utility of purchase decisions either as a function of the
consumed quantity of the product or as the gain of sellers/buyers in the
monetary sense. As most consumers just purchase one unit of a product at a time
and most alternatives have similar prices, such modeling of purchase utility is
likely to be inaccurate in practice. In this paper, we interpret purchase
utility as the satisfaction level a consumer gets from a product and propose a
recommendation framework using EU to model consumers' behavioral patterns. We
assume that consumer estimates the expected utilities of all the alternatives
and choose products with maximum expected utility for each purchase. To deal
with the potential psychological biases of each consumer, we introduce the
usage of Probability Weight Function (PWF) and design our algorithm based on

state estimation of adaptive buildings with active load-bearing elements. For
obtaining information on structural deformation, a system composed of a digital
camera and optical emitters affixed to selected nodal points is introduced as a
complement to conventional strain gauge sensors. Sensor fusion for this novel
combination of sensors is carried out using a Kalman filter that operates on a
reduced-order structure model obtained by modal analysis. Signal delay caused
by image processing is compensated for by an out-of-sequence measurement update
which provides for a flexible and modular estimation algorithm. Since the
camera system is very precise, a self-tuning algorithm that adjusts model along
with observer parameters is introduced to reduce discrepancy between system
dynamic model and actual structural behavior. We further employ optimal sensor
placement to limit the number of sensors to be placed on a given structure and
examine the impact on estimation accuracy. A laboratory scale model of an
adaptive high-rise with actuated columns and diagonal bracings is used for
experimental demonstration of the proposed estimation scheme.

Unlike the pristine FGT, a plateau-like magnetoresistance (PMR) is observed in
the magnetotransport of our homojunction due to the antiparallel magnetic
configurations of the two FGT layers. The PMR ratio is found to be ~0.05% and
gets monotonically enhanced as temperature decreases like a metallic giant
magnetoresistance (GMR). Such a tiny PMR ratio is at least three orders of

our clean metallic junction without a spacer. Our findings demonstrate the

observations that could restrict our model, focusing on the deformations of
velocity, redshift and luminosity distance, which in the aforementioned

dependent velocity there would be no time delay for massless particles since
also the observed distance to the source depends on the energy. For the

learns the regularizer and the iteration parameters automatically through
network training with a large amount of simulated DBT data. Afterwards, both

Quantitative metrics such as the artifact spread function (ASF), breast

optimization strategy to enable large-scale nonlinear thermal network
optimization. In order to avoid a strong computational cost scaling with the
network size, we aggregate consumer constraints with a constraint aggregation
strategy. Moreover, to align this continuous optimization strategy with the
discrete nature of topology optimization and pipe size choices, we present a
numerical continuation strategy that gradually forces the design variables

the algorithm by designing a fictitious district heating network with 160

investment cost and pumping power, while keeping the heat supplied to the
consumers within a thermal comfort range of 5 %. Starting from a uniform

finds a network lay-out that reduces piping investment by 23 % and pump-related

computational models of the {\gamma}-alumina surface are constructed based on
the Step-by-Step Hydrogen Termination (SSHT) approach. Dangling bonds, which
appear by cutting the crystal structure of a model, are terminated stepwise
with H atoms until the model has an appropriate energy gap. The obtained SSHT
models exhibit the realistic infrared (IR) and ultraviolet-visible (UV/Vis)
spectra. Vibronic coupling density (VCD), as a reactivity index, is employed to
elucidate the regioselectivity of the Cu adsorption on the {\gamma}-alumina and
that of the NO adsorption on the Cu/{\gamma}-alumina in place of the frontier
orbital theory that could not provide clear results. We discovered that the
highly dispersed Cu atoms are loaded on Lewis-basic O atoms, which is known as
anchoring effect, located in the tetrahedral sites of the {\gamma}-alumina
surface. The role of the {\gamma}-alumina support is to raise the frontier
orbital of the Cu catalyst, which in turn gives rise to the electron
back-donation from the Cu/{\gamma}-alumina to NO. In addition, the penetration
of the VCD distribution of the Cu/{\gamma}-alumina into the {\gamma}-alumina
support indicates that the excessive reaction energies dissipate into the
support after the NO adsorption and reduction. In other words, the support
plays the role of a heat bath. The NO reduction on the Cu/{\gamma}-alumina
proceeds even in an oxidative atmosphere because the Cu-NO bond is strongly
bounded compared to the Cu-O2 bond.

challenges in terms of privacy preservation, communication overheads, and

promising alternative paradigm to support the training of machine learning (ML)
models. In contrast to the centralized data storage and processing in CLNs,
FLNs exploit a number of edge devices (EDs) to store data and perform training
distributively. In this way, the EDs in FLNs can keep training data locally,
which preserves privacy and reduces communication overheads. However, since the
model training within FLNs relies on the contribution of all EDs, the training
process can be disrupted if some of the EDs upload incorrect or falsified
training results, i.e., poisoning attacks. In this paper, we review the
vulnerabilities of FLNs, and particularly give an overview of poisoning attacks
and mainstream countermeasures. Nevertheless, the existing countermeasures can
only provide passive protection and fail to consider the training fees paid for
the contributions of the EDs, resulting in a unnecessarily high training cost.
Hence, we present a smart security enhancement framework for FLNs. In
particular, a verify-before-aggregate (VBA) procedure is developed to identify
and remove the non-benign training results from the EDs. Afterward, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) is applied to learn the behaving patterns of the
EDs and to actively select the EDs that can provide benign training results and
charge low training fees. Simulation results reveal that the proposed framework
can protect FLNs effectively and efficiently.

attention. One way to improve accuracy is to combine the strengths of a set of
existing models through model averaging. The model-averaged forecast is derived
using empirical model weights that optimise forecast accuracy at each forecast
horizon based on historical data. We apply model averaging to fertility
forecasting for the first time, using data for 17 countries and six models.
Four model-averaging methods are compared: frequentist, Bayesian, model
confidence set, and equal weights. We compute individual-model and
model-averaged point and interval forecasts at horizons of one to 20 years. We
demonstrate gains in average accuracy of 4-23\% for point forecasts and 3-24\%
for interval forecasts, with greater gains from the frequentist and
equal-weights approaches at longer horizons. Data for England \& Wales are used
to illustrate model averaging in forecasting age-specific fertility to 2036.
The advantages and further potential of model averaging for fertility
forecasting are discussed. As the accuracy of model-averaged forecasts depends
on the accuracy of the individual models, there is ongoing need to develop
better models of fertility for use in forecasting and model averaging. We
conclude that model averaging holds considerable promise for the improvement of
fertility forecasting in a systematic way using existing models and warrants
further investigation.

framework of the inverse Ising problem when the $\ell_2$-regularized (ridge)
linear regression is adopted. This setup is introduced for theoretically
investigating the situation where the data generation model is different from
the inference one, namely the model mismatch situation. In the teacher-student
scenario under the assumption that the teacher couplings are sparse, the
analysis is conducted using the replica and cavity methods, with a special
focus on whether the presence/absence of teacher couplings is correctly
inferred or not. The result indicates that despite the model mismatch, one can
perfectly identify the network structure using naive linear regression without
regularization when the number of spins $N$ is smaller than the dataset size
$M$, in the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$. Further, to access the
underdetermined region $M < N$, we examine the effect of the $\ell_2$
regularization, and find that biases appear in all the coupling estimates,
preventing the perfect identification of the network structure. We, however,
find that the biases are shown to decay exponentially fast as the distance from
the center spin chosen in the pseudolikelihood method grows. Based on this
finding, we propose a two-stage estimator: In the first stage, the ridge
regression is used and the estimates are pruned by a relatively small
threshold; in the second stage the naive linear regression is conducted only on
the remaining couplings, and the resultant estimates are again pruned by
another relatively large threshold. This estimator with the appropriate
regularization coefficient and thresholds is shown to achieve the perfect
identification of the network structure even in $0<M/N<1$. Results of extensive
numerical experiments support these findings.

  Droplets","37 pages, 14 figures, research article",,,,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Effects of spinning motion on the bouncing and coalescence between a spinning
droplet and a non-spinning droplet undergoing the head-on collision were
numerically studied by using a Volume-of-Fluid method. A prominent discovery is
that the spinning droplet can induce significant non-axisymmetric flow features
for the head-on collision of equal-size droplets composed of the same liquid.
Specifically, a non-axisymmetric bouncing was observed, and it is caused by the
conversion of the spinning angular momentum into the orbital angular momentum.
This process is accompanied by the rotational kinetic energy loss due to the
interaction between the rotational and radial flows of the droplets. A
non-axisymmetric internal flow and a delayed separation after temporary
coalescence were also observed, and they are caused by the enhanced interface
oscillation and internal-flow-induced viscous dissipation. The spinning motion
can also promote the mass interminglement of droplets because the locally
non-uniform mass exchange occurs at the early collision stage by
non-axisymmetric flow and is further stretched along the filament at later
collision stages. In addition, it is found that the non-axisymmetric flow
features increase with increasing the orthogonality of the initial
translational motion and the spinning motion of droplets.

new connections are the most likely to appear in the future? In multiplex link
prediction we also ask: of which type? Because this last question is
unanswerable with classical link prediction, here we investigate the use of
graph association rules to inform multiplex link prediction. We derive such
rules by identifying all frequent patterns in a network via multiplex graph
mining, and then score each unobserved link's likelihood by finding the
occurrences of each rule in the original network. Association rules add new
abilities to multiplex link prediction: to predict new node arrivals, to
consider higher order structures with four or more nodes, and to be memory
efficient. In our experiments, we show that, exploiting graph association
rules, we are able to achieve a prediction performance close to an ideal
ensemble classifier. Further, we perform a case study on a signed multiplex
network, showing how graph association rules can provide valuable insights to

of continuous and discontinuous nonlinear transitions between linear current
intervals. The thin film grain microstructure in our samples is determined
using atomic force and scanning electron microscopy to be on the scale of 30
nm. Micromagnetic simulations show that the reflection of spin waves against
the grain boundaries results in standing wave resonance configurations. For a
simulated device with a single artificial grain, the frequency increases
linearly with the drive current until the decreased wavelength eventually
forces another spin wave anti-node to be formed. This transition results in a
discontinuous step in the frequency versus current relation. Simulations of
complete, randomly generated grain microstructures additionally shows
continuous nonlinearity and a resulting device-to-device variation in frequency
that is similar to the experimental levels. The impact of temperature from 4 K

investigated using simulations and it is found that the peak levels of the

and quantitatively evaluated for nitrogen admixtures in argon plasma under the
influence of a strong magnetic field. TDLIF measurements were used to evaluate
light-transport properties in a strongly magnetized optically thick
argon/nitrogen plasma under different pressure conditions. Therefore, a coupled
system of rate balance equations was constructed to describe laser pumping of
individual magnetic sub-levels of $\mathrm{2p_8}$ state through
frequency-separated sub-transitions originating from $\mathrm{1s_4}$ magnetic
sub-levels. The density distribution (alignment) of $\mathrm{2p_8}$ multiplet
was described by balancing laser pumping with losses including radiative decay,
transfer of excitation between the neighboring sub-levels in the
$\mathrm{2p_8}$ multiplet driven by neutral collisions (argon and nitrogen) and
quenching due to electron and neutral collisions. Resulting $\mathrm{2p_8}$
magnetic sub-level densities were then used to model polarization dependent
fluorescence, considering self-absorption, which could be directly compared
with polarization-resolved TDLIF measurements. This enables to estimate the
disalignment rate constant for the $\mathrm{2p_8}$ state due to collisions by
molecular nitrogen. A comparison to molecular theory description is given
providing satisfactory agreement. The presented measurement method and model
can help to describe optical emission of argon and argon-nitrogen admixtures in
magnetized conditions and provides a basis for further description of optical
emission spectra in magnetized plasmas.

we note that the lines appear deeper in the ESPRESSO spectra than in PEPSI and
HARPS. The stellar parameters derived from each spectrograph by combining the
several available spectra agree well overall. We conclude that the ESPRESSO,

broadband quantum light pulses, forged at entanglement creation, represents a
promising route to the practical delivery of many multipartite quantum
information applications. However, the scalability of such applications is
largely limited by the entanglement decoherence caused by photon loss. One
promising method to combat such losses is noiseless linear amplification.
However, while there have been various procedures that implement noiseless
linear amplification on single-mode states, no realization has thus far been
proposed for noiseless linear amplification on quantum states carrying a
multimode structure. In this work we close this gap, proposing a novel
Noiseless Linear Amplifier (NLA) with Photon Catalysis (PC), namely, the
PC-NLA. Constructing a multimode version of an existing NLA that uses Quantum
Scissors (QS), the QS-NLA, we then show how the PC-NLA is compatible with the
QS-NLA, even though the former uses half the physical resources of the latter.
We then apply our newly developed multimode NLA frameworks to the problem of
Continuous-Variable (CV) entanglement distillation, determining how the
multimode structure of the entanglement impacts the performance of the NLAs.
Different from single-mode NLA analyses, we find that a multimode NLA is only
effective as a CV entanglement distillation strategy when the channel loss is
beyond some threshold - a threshold largely dependent on the multimode
structure. The results provided here will be valuable for real-world
implementations of multipartite quantum information applications that utilize
complex entanglement structure within broadband light pulses.

In this paper, we propose an improved model-independent method to constrain the
cosmic curvature, which is geometrically related to the Hubble parameter $H(z)$
and luminosity distance $D_L(z)$. Using the currently largest $H(z)$ sample
from the well-known cosmic chronometers, as well as the luminosity distance
$D_L(z)$ from the relation between the UV and X-ray luminosities of 1598
quasars and the newly-compiled Pantheon sample including 1048 SNe Ia, 31
independent measurements of the cosmic curvature $\Omega_k(z)$ can be expected
covering the redshift range of $0.07<z<2$. Our estimation of $\Omega_k(z)$ is
fully compatible with flat Universe at the current level of observational
precision. Meanwhile, we find that, for the Hubble diagram of 1598 quasars as a
new type of standard candle, the spatial curvature is constrained to be
$\Omega_k=0.08\pm0.31$. For the latest Pantheon sample of SNe Ia observations,
we obtain $\Omega_k= -0.02\pm0.14$. Compared to other approaches aiming for
model-independent estimations of spatial curvature, our analysis also achieves
constraints with competitive precision. More interestingly, it is suggested
that the reconstructed curvature $\Omega_k$ is negative in the high redshift
region, which is also consistent with the results from the model-dependent
constraints in the literature. Such findings are confirmed by our reconstructed
evolution of $\Omega_k(z)$, in the framework of a model-independent method of

it difficult for high demand observatories to undertake follow up observations

stars. We consider two representative case studies: WASP-52b with 13 new
transits, and HAT-P-23b with 17 new transits and concurrent photometric
monitoring covering 78 days. We present updated system parameters and combine
our new transit times with previously published results to calculate new
ephemerides for both systems. Our analysis of transit mid-times for WASP-52b
results in a slight preference for a quadratic ephemeris ($\Delta\chi_{\nu}^2 =
0.07$, $\Delta BIC = 1.53$ over a linear ephemeris. We discuss the reality of
this quadratic ephemeris indicating a period change of $ \delta P / \delta t =
-38.6\pm4{\rm ms~yr^{-1}}$ and consider possible causes. WASP-52 is known to be
an active star with previous publications reporting many spot crossing events,
however no such events are seen in our new photometry. Our analysis shows that
WASP-52 is still active and that the latitude of the spots has likely migrated
away from the transit chord. We confirm the inflated nature and circular orbit
for HAT-P-23b. Our monitoring of HAT-P-23 reveals a periodicity of 7.015 days
with an amplitude of 0.011 mag which we interpret as the rotation period of
HAT-P-23. The photometric and transit timing precision achieved in the case
studies shows that this class of telescope is capable of precise

Weights are determined with batch learning. Multiple iterations are used per

Then, except for the first hidden layer, the input values are also modified
with a MILP to better match the layer outputs to their corresponding target

170(6) 421-428), is a method known to stabilise periodic orbits in low
dimensional chaotic dynamical systems. A system of the form
$\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)=f(\mathbf{x})$ has an additional term
$G(\mathbf{x}(t)-\mathbf{x}(t-T))$ introduced where $G$ is some `gain matrix'
and $T$ a time delay. The form of the delay term is such that it will vanish
for any orbit of period $T,$ therefore making it also an orbit of the
uncontrolled system. This non-invasive feature makes the method attractive for
stabilising exact coherent structures in fluid turbulence. Here we begin by
validating the method for the basic flow in Kolmogorov flow; a two-dimensional
incompressible Navier-Stokes flow with a sinusoidal body force. The linear
predictions for stabilisation are well captured by direct numerical simulation.
By applying an adaptive method to adjust the streamwise translation of the
delay, a known travelling wave solution is able to be stabilised up to
relatively high Reynolds number. We discover that the famous `odd-number'
limitation of this time-delayed feedback method can be overcome in the fluid
problem by using the symmetries of the system. This leads to the discovery of 8
additional exact coherent structures which can be stabilised with this
approach. This means that certain unstable exact coherent structures can be
obtained by simply time-stepping a modified set of equations, thus
circumventing the usual convergence algorithms.

complement terrestrial experiments. Massless neutrinos in the Standard Model of

finite magnetic moment in the minimal extension of the Standard Model. Large
extra dimensions are a possible solution of the hierarchy problem. Both of
these provide additional energy loss channels in stellar interiors via the
electromagnetic interaction and radiation into extra dimensions, respectively,
and thus affect stellar evolution. We perform simulations of stellar evolution
with such additional energy losses and find that they eliminate the blue loops
in the evolution of intermediate-mass stars. The existence of Cepheid stars can
be used to constrain the neutrino magnetic moment and large extra dimensions.
In order for Cepheids to exist, the neutrino magnetic moment should be smaller
than the range ~2x10^{-10} to 4x10^{-11}mu_B, where mu_B is the Bohr magneton,
and the fundamental scale in the (4+2)-spacetime should be larger than ~2 to 5
TeV, depending on the rate of the ^{12}C(alpha, gamma)^{16}O reaction. The
fundamental scale also has strong dependence on the metallicity. This value of
the magnetic moment is in the range explored in the reactor experiments, but
higher than the limit inferred from globular clusters. Similarly the
fundamental scale value we constrain corresponds to a size of the compactified
dimensions comparable to those explored in the torsion balance experiments, but
is smaller than the limits inferred from collider experiments and low-mass

a novel technique for debloating, which we call coverage-based debloating. We
implement the technique for one single language: Java bytecode. We leverage a
combination of state-of-the-art Java bytecode coverage tools to precisely
capture what parts of a project and its dependencies are used when running with
a specific workload. Then, we automatically remove the parts that are not
covered, in order to generate a debloated version of the project. We succeed to
debloat 211 library versions from a dataset of 94 unique open-source Java
libraries. The debloated versions are syntactically correct and preserve their
original behavior according to the workload. Our results indicate that 68.3% of
the libraries' bytecode and 20.3% of their total dependencies can be removed
through coverage-based debloating. For the first time in the literature on
software debloating, we assess the utility of debloated libraries with respect
to client applications that reuse them. We select 988 client projects that
either have a direct reference to the debloated library in their source code or
which test suite covers at least one class of the libraries that we debloat.
Our results show that 81.5% of the clients, with at least one test that uses
the library, successfully compile and pass their test suite when the original

polar, AM Herculis, supported by ground-based photometry and spectroscopy, all
obtained in high accretion states. In 2005, AM Herculis was in its regular mode
of accretion, showing a self-eclipse of the main accreting pole. X-ray emission
during the self-eclipse was assigned to a second pole through its soft X-ray
emission and not to scattering. In 2015, AM Herculis was in its reversed mode
with strong soft blobby accretion at the far accretion region. The blobby
acretion region was more luminous than the other, persistently accreting,
therefore called main region. Hard X-rays from the main region did not show a
self-eclipse indicating a pronounced migration of the accretion footpoint.
Extended phases of soft X-ray extinction through absorption in interbinary
matter were observed for the first time in AM Herculis. The spectral parameters
of a large number of individual soft flares could be derived. Simultaneous
NuSTAR observations in the reversed mode of accretion revealed clear evidence
for Compton reflection of radiation from the main pole at the white dwarf
surface. This picture is supported by the trace of the Fe resonance line at 6.4
keV through the whole orbit. Highly ionized oxygen lines observed with the
Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) were tentatively located at the bottom of
the accretion column, although the implied densities are quite different from
expectations. In the regular mode of accretion, the phase-dependent modulations
in the ultraviolet (UV) are explained with projection effects of an
accretion-heated spot at the prime pole. In the reversed mode projection
effects cannot be recognized. The light curves reveal an extra source of UV
radiation and extended UV absorbing dips. An Ha Doppler map obtained

  Classification",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graph convolutional neural network (GCN) has effectively boosted the
multi-label image recognition task by introducing label dependencies based on
statistical label co-occurrence of data. However, in previous methods, label
correlation is computed based on statistical information of data and therefore
the same for all samples, and this makes graph inference on labels insufficient
to handle huge variations among numerous image instances. In this paper, we
propose an instance-aware graph convolutional neural network (IA-GCN) framework
for multi-label classification. As a whole, two fused branches of sub-networks
are involved in the framework: a global branch modeling the whole image and a
region-based branch exploring dependencies among regions of interests (ROIs).
For label diffusion of instance-awareness in graph convolution, rather than
using the statistical label correlation alone, an image-dependent label
correlation matrix (LCM), fusing both the statistical LCM and an individual one
of each image instance, is constructed for graph inference on labels to inject
adaptive information of label-awareness into the learned features of the model.
Specifically, the individual LCM of each image is obtained by mining the label
dependencies based on the scores of labels about detected ROIs. In this
process, considering the contribution differences of ROIs to multi-label
classification, variational inference is introduced to learn adaptive scaling
factors for those ROIs by considering their complex distribution. Finally,
extensive experiments on MS-COCO and VOC datasets show that our proposed
approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

the three-state chiral Potts model on the square lattice, a model proposed in
the eighties to describe commensurate-incommensurate transitions at surfaces,
and with direct relevance to recent experiments on chains of Rydberg atoms.
This model was suggested by Huse and Fisher to have a chiral transition in the
vicinity of the Potts point, a possibility that turned out to be very difficult
to definitely establish or refute numerically. Our results confirm that the
transition changes character at a Lifshitz point that separates a line of
Pokrosky-Talapov transition far enough from the Potts point from a line of
direct continuous order-disorder transition close to it. Thanks to the accuracy
of the numerical results, we have been able to base the analysis entirely on
effective exponents to deal with the crossovers that have hampered previous
numerical investigations. The emerging picture is that of a new universality
class with exponents that do not change between the Potts point and the
Lifshitz point, and that are consistent with those of a self-dual version of
the model, namely correlation lengths exponents $\nu_x=2/3$ in the direction of
the asymmetry and $\nu_y=1$ perpendicular to it, an incommensurability exponent
$\bar \beta=2/3$, a specific heat exponent that keeps the value $\alpha=1/3$ of
the three-state Potts model, and a dynamical exponent $z=3/2$. These results
are in excellent agreement with experimental results obtained on reconstructed
surfaces in the nineties, and shed light on recent Kibble-Zurek experiments on
the period-3 phase of chains of Rydberg atoms.

they are noisy devices and require error correction mechanisms, e.g., by
employing Fuzzy Extractors (FEs). Recent works demonstrated that applying FEs
for error correction may enable new opportunities to break the PUFs if no
countermeasures are taken. In this paper, we address an attack model on FEs
hardware implementations and provide a solution for early identification of the
timing Side-Channel Attack (SCA) vulnerabilities which can be exploited by
physical fault injection. The significance of this work stems from the fact
that FEs are an essential building block in the implementations of PUF-enabled
devices. The information leaked through the timing side-channel during the
error correction process can reveal the FE input data and thereby can endanger
revealing secrets. Therefore, it is very important to identify the potential
leakages early in the process during RTL design. Experimental results based on
RTL analysis of several Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) and Reed-Solomon
decoders for PUF-enabled devices with FEs demonstrate the feasibility of the

infrared (IR) image pairs are well-suited for practical applications like
autonomous driving or visual surveillance. Such data can be used to increase
the performance of pedestrian detection especially for weakly illuminated,
small-scaled, or partially occluded instances. The current state-of-the-art is
based on variants of Faster R-CNN and thus passes through two stages: a
proposal generator network with handcrafted anchor boxes for object
localization and a classification network for verifying the object category. In
this paper we propose a method for effective and efficient multispectral fusion
of the two modalities in an adapted single-stage anchor-free base architecture.
We aim at learning pedestrian representations based on object center and scale
rather than direct bounding box predictions. In this way, we can both simplify
the network architecture and achieve higher detection performance, especially
for pedestrians under occlusion or at low object resolution. In addition, we
provide a study on well-suited multispectral data augmentation techniques that
improve the commonly used augmentations. The results show our method's
effectiveness in detecting small-scaled pedestrians. We achieve 5.68%
log-average miss rate in comparison to the best current state-of-the-art of
7.49% (25% improvement) on the challenging KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian

and topological metalicity. The mechanism, which relies on combining the
classic double-exchange (DE) physics with the Rashba spin orbit coupling (SOC),
not only provides an accurate understanding of existence of skyrmions but also
explains key features in small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and Lorentz
transmission electron microscopy (LTEM) data on thin films of a variety of
magnetic metals. The skyrmion states are characterized as disordered
topological metals via explicit calculations of Bott index and Hall
conductivity. Local density of states (LDOS) display characteristic
oscillations that are shown to be arising from a combination of confinement
effect and gauge-field induced Landau level physics. The presence of
oscillations in LDOS, without external magnetic flux, is a direct consequence
of the Rashba-Zener (RZ) mechanism. The results are based on hybrid simulations
on a model that explicitly retains itinerant electronic degrees of freedom. A
simple physical picture is provided via an effective short-range spin model
with coupling constants that depend on electronic kinetic energy. The mechanism
reported here not only opens up a new approach to understand skyrmion formation
in metals, but also provides a guiding principle for discovering exotic
topological metal states.

tokamaks to study disruption dynamics and mitigation schemes. Two events often
observed in those experiments are the excitation of the $m=2, n=1$
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) mode, and the formation of cold bubble structure in
the temperature distribution before the thermal quench (TQ). Here $m$ is the
poloidal mode number, $n$ the toroidal mode number. The physics mechanisms
underlying those phenomena, however, have not been entirely clear. In this
work, our recent NIMROD simulations of the MGI process in a tokamak have
reproduced the main features of both events, which has allowed us to examine
and establish the causal relation between them. In these simulations, the $3/1$
and $2/1$ islands are found to form successively after the arrival of impurity
ion cold front at the corresponding $q = 3$ and $q = 2$ rational surfaces. At
the interface between impurity and plasma, a local thin current sheet forms due
to an enhanced local pressure gradient and moves inward following the gas cold
front, this may contribute to the formation of a dominant $2/1$ mode. Following
the growth of the $2/1$ tearing mode, the impurity penetration into the core
region inside the $q=2$ surface gives rise to the formation of the cold bubble
temperature structure and initiates the final TQ. A subdominant $1/1$ mode
developed earlier near the $q=1$ surface alone does not cause such a cold
bubble formation, however, the exact manner of the preceding impurity
penetration depends on the nature of the $1/1$ mode: kink-tearing or
quasi-interchange.

the AB oscillations were observed for a short channel. Analyses based on

proof utilizes the technique of ridgelet analysis, a harmonic analysis method

become one of the most successful tools to treat lattice systems numerically.
Nevertheless, systems with large local Hilbert spaces remain challenging. Here,
we introduce a mapping that allows to construct artificial $U(1)$ symmetries

expenses that are related to the local degrees of freedom decrease
significantly. This allows for an efficient treatment of systems with large

motivate an intuitive physical picture of the truncations occurring in typical
algorithms and we give bounds on the numerical complexity in comparison to
standard methods that do not exploit such artificial symmetries. We demonstrate

In the general two Higgs doublet model with extra Yukawa couplings, we show
that all these processes probe the lepton flavor violating (LFV) dipole

terms subdominant. This is because existing data suggest the extra Yukawa

$\rho_{\tau\mu},\, \rho_{\tau\tau} \lesssim \lambda_\tau$ and $\rho_{tt}

different domains (e.g., visible and thermal) are co-registered and temporally
synchronized. This paper proposes a novel domain adaptation framework that
combines a new feature mapping sub-network with existing deep feature models,
which are based on modified network architectures (e.g., VGG16 or Resnet50).
This framework is optimized by introducing new cross-domain identity and domain
invariance loss functions for thermal-to-visible face recognition, which
alleviates the requirement for precisely co-registered and synchronized
imagery. We provide extensive analysis of both features and loss functions
used, and compare the proposed domain adaptation framework with
state-of-the-art feature based domain adaptation models on a difficult dataset
containing facial imagery collected at varying ranges, poses, and expressions.
Moreover, we analyze the viability of the proposed framework for more
challenging tasks, such as non-frontal thermal-to-visible face recognition.

$R(I)$ that can be computed efficiently and the downsets of $R(I)$ are in
one-to-one correspondence with the stable matchings of $I$. Furthermore, for
every poset $P$, an instance $I(P)$ can be constructed efficiently so that the
rotation poset of $I(P)$ is isomorphic to $P$. In this case, we say that $I(P)$
realizes $P$. Many researchers exploit the rotation poset of an instance to
develop fast algorithms or to establish the hardness of stable matching
problems.
  In order to gain a parameterized understanding of the complexity of sampling
stable matchings, Bhatnagar et al. [SODA 2008] introduced stable matching
instances whose preference lists are restricted but nevertheless model
situations that arise in practice. In this paper, we study four such
parameterized restrictions; our goal is to characterize the rotation posets
that arise from these models: $k$-bounded, $k$-attribute, $(k_1, k_2)$-list,
$k$-range.
  We prove that there is a constant $k$ so that every rotation poset is
realized by some instance in the first three models for some fixed constant
$k$. We describe efficient algorithms for constructing such instances given the
Hasse diagram of a poset. As a consequence, the fundamental problem of counting
stable matchings remains $\#$BIS-complete even for these restricted instances.
  For $k$-range preferences, we show that a poset $P$ is realizable if and only
if the Hasse diagram of $P$ has pathwidth bounded by functions of $k$. Using
this characterization, we show that the following problems are fixed parameter
tractable when parametrized by the range of the instance: exactly counting and
uniformly sampling stable matchings, finding median, sex-equal, and balanced

framework is extended with heterogeneous (local) weighting factors - one per
finite element - equilibrating the goal function locally according to the
material behavior. This modification allows the data-driven solver to cope with
unbalanced measurement data sets, i.e. data sets suffering from unbalanced
space filling. This occurs particularly in the case of strongly nonlinear
materials, which constitute problematic cases that hinder the efficiency and
accuracy of standard data-driven solvers with a homogeneous (global) weighting
factor. The local weighting factors are embedded in the distance-minimizing
data-driven algorithm used for noiseless data, likewise for the maximum entropy
data-driven algorithm used for noisy data. Numerical experiments based on a
quadrupole magnet model with a soft magnetic material show that the proposed
modification results in major improvements in terms of solution accuracy and

improve the convergence of the data-driven solver by orders of magnitude. When
noisy data are considered, the convergence rate of the data-driven solver is

is cannibalistic dark matter (CanDM), which has exothermal number-changing
interactions allowing it to stay warm far into its non-relativistic regime.
Here we investigate the cosmological implications of CanDM and how it impacts
CMB anisotropies and the matter power spectrum, by implementing the model
within a linear Einstein-Boltzmann solver. We show that CanDM suppresses the
small scale matter power spectrum in a way very similar to light Warm Dark
Matter or Hot Dark Matter. However, unlike in those models, the suppression may
happen while the CanDM model still remains compatible with CMB constraints. We
put strong constraints on the interaction strength of CanDM as a function of
its abundance for both constant and temperature-dependent thermally-averaged
cross sections. We find that the CanDM model can easily solve the $S_8$ tension
(but has no impact on the Hubble tension). Indeed, it can accommodate values of
$S_8$ of the order of 0.76 while being compatible with CMB+BAO data. However,
as long as the $S_8$ tension remains moderate, the overall $\chi^2$ improvement
is relatively small given the number of extra free parameters, and the CanDM
model is not significantly preferred.

geochemical features of Mercury. Yet, the fate of the impactors and their
effects on Mercury's surface through the bombardment epoch are not clear. Using
Monte-Carlo and analytical approaches of cratering impacts, we investigate the
physical and thermodynamical outcomes of late accretion on Mercury. Considering
the uncertainties in late accretion, we develop scaling laws for the following
parameters as a function of impact velocity and total mass of late accretion:
(1) depth of crustal erosion, (2) the degree of resurfacing, and (3) mass
accreted from impactor material. Existing dynamical models indicate that
Mercury experienced an intense impact bombardment (a total mass of $\sim 8
\times 10^{18} - 8 \times 10^{20}$ kg with a typical impact velocity of $30-40$
km s$^{-1}$) after $4.5$ Ga. With this, we find that late accretion could
remove 50 m to 10 km of the early crust of Mercury, but the change to its
core-to-mantle ratio is negligible. Alternatively, the mantles of putative
differentiated planetesimals in the early solar system could be more easily
removed and their respective core fraction increased, if Mercury ultimately
accreted from such objects. Although the cratering is notable for erasing the
older geological surface records on Mercury, we show that $\sim 40-50$ wt% of
the impactor's exogenic materials, including the volatile-bearing materials,
can be heterogeneously implanted on Mercury's surface as a late veneer
($>3\times 10^{18}-1.6 \times 10^{19}$ kg in total). About half of the accreted
impactor's materials are vaporized, and the rest is completely melted upon the
impact. We expect that the further interplay between our theoretical results
and forthcoming surface observations of Mercury, including the BepiColombo
mission, will lead us to a better understanding of Mercury's origin and
evolution.

  Cort\'es",,,,"hep-th gr-qc hep-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this Ph.D. thesis several topics in doubly special relativity are
explored. The starting point of this theory is very different from other
perspectives: it is not a fundamental theory, but it is considered a low energy
limit of a quantum gravity theory that tries to study its possible residual
elements. In particular, in doubly special relativity the Einstenian relativity
principle is generalized, adding to the speed of light $c$ another relativistic
invariant, the Planck length $l_p$. This idea can really have possible
experimental observations, giving place to what is known as quantum gravity
phenomenology. On the other hand, doubly special relativity implies the
existence of deformed composition laws for energy and momentum, which leads to
a spacetime with nonlocal ingredients, an element that also appears in other
approaches of quantum gravity.
  In particular in this thesis we consider: the role that the changes of
momentum variables play in a deformed relativistic kinematics; a novel
connection between the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e model and a curved momentum space; a
new spacetime, which turns out to be noncommutative, making the interactions
local; the possible time delay in the flight of photons as a consequence of a
deformed kinematics, depending on whether observables are defined on a
commutative or on a noncommutative spacetime; some computations in quantum
field theory with a simple ansatz for the modified Feynman rules corresponding
to a particle process; the generalization of the geometrical approach for a
curved spacetime.

the performance of the semi-supervised deep learning architecture known as

weight to the observationscorresponding to the under-represented class. For
unlabelled observations, we propose the usage of the pseudo and augmentedlabels
calculated by MixMatch to choose the appropriate weight. The MixMatch method
combined with the proposed pseudo-label based balance correction improved
classification accuracy by up to 10%, with respect to the non balanced MixMatch

laser machining is a tool of green manufacturing as it can remove thin films by
ablation without use of toxic chemicals. However, laser ablation causes thermal
damage on neighboring patterns and underneath substrates, hindering its
extensive use with high precision and integrity. Here, using ultrashort laser
pulses of sub-picosecond duration, we demonstrate an ultrafast mechanism of
laser ablation that leads to selective removal of a thin metal film with
minimal damage on the substrate. The ultrafast laser ablation is accomplished
with the insertion of a transition metal interlayer that offers high
electron-phonon coupling to trigger vaporization in a picosecond timescale.
This contained form of heat transfer permits lifting off the metal thin-film
layer while blocking heat conduction to the substrate. Our ultrafast scheme of
selective thin film removal is analytically validated using a two-temperature
model of heat transfer between electrons and phonons in material. Further,
experimental verification is made using 0.2 ps laser pulses by micropatterning
metal films for various applications.

one of the fundamental components of many current data structures in string
processing. It is central in data compression, as well as in efficient query
algorithms for sequence data, such as webpages, genomic and other biological
sequences, or indeed any textual data. The BWT lends itself well to compression
because its number of equal-letter-runs (usually referred to as $r$) is often
considerably lower than that of the original string; in particular, it is well
suited for strings with many repeated factors. In fact, much attention has been
paid to the $r$ parameter as measure of repetitiveness, especially to evaluate
the performance in terms of both space and time of compressed indexing data
structures.
  In this paper, we investigate $\rho(v)$, the ratio of $r$ and of the number
of runs of the BWT of the reverse of $v$. Kempa and Kociumaka [FOCS 2020] gave
the first non-trivial upper bound as $\rho(v) = O(\log^2(n))$, for any string
$v$ of length $n$. However, nothing is known about the tightness of this upper
bound. We present infinite families of binary strings for which $\rho(v) =
\Theta(\log n)$ holds, thus giving the first non-trivial lower bound on
$\rho(n)$, the maximum over all strings of length $n$.
  Our results suggest that $r$ is not an ideal measure of the repetitiveness of
the string, since the number of repeated factors is invariant between the
string and its reverse. We believe that there is a more intricate relationship
between the number of runs of the BWT and the string's combinatorial
properties.

performance in large-scale networks at relatively low computational cost. A
common model of such a system is a network of $N$ parallel queues in which
incoming jobs with independent and identically distributed service times are
routed on arrival using the join-the-shortest-of-$d$-queues routing algorithm.
Under fairly general conditions, it was shown by Aghajani and Ramanan that as
$N\rightarrow\infty$, the state dynamics converges to the unique solution of a
countable system of coupled deterministic measure-valued equations called the
hydrodynamic equations. In this article, a characterization of invariant states
of these hydrodynamic equations is obtained and, when $d=2$, used to construct
a numerical algorithm to compute the queue length distribution and mean virtual
waiting time in the invariant state. Additionally, it is also shown that under
a suitable tail condition on the service distribution, the queue length
distribution of the invariant state exhibits a doubly exponential tail decay,
thus demonstrating a vast improvement in performance over the case $d=1$, which
corresponds to random routing, when the tail decay could even be polynomial.
Furthermore, numerical evidence is provided to support the conjecture that the
invariant state is the limit of the steady-state distributions of the
$N$-server models. The proof methodology, which entails analysis of a coupled
system of measure-valued equations, can potentially be applied to other
many-server systems with general service distributions, where measure-valued
representations are useful.

of the imaging light, for all techniques based on linear optics. Here we report
on a high-resolution ion microscope as a versatile and powerful experimental
tool to investigate quantum gases. The instrument clearly resolves atoms in an
optical lattice with a spacing of $532\,\text{nm}$ over a field of view of 50
sites and offers an extremely large depth of field on the order of at least
$70\,\mu\text{m}$. With a simple model, we extract an upper limit for the
achievable resolution of approximately $200\,\text{nm}$ from our data. We
demonstrate a pulsed operation mode which in the future will enable 3D imaging
and allow for the study of ionic impurities and Rydberg physics.

simple message: keep the effective '$R$ number' $R<1$ to prevent widespread
contagion and flatten the curve. This raises the question whether a similar
policy could control dangerous online 'infodemics' of information,
misinformation and disinformation. Here we show, using multi-platform data from
the COVID-19 infodemic, that its online spreading instead encompasses a
different dynamical regime where communities and users within and across
independent platforms, sporadically form temporary active links on similar
timescales to the viral spreading. This allows material that might have died
out, to evolve and even mutate. This has enabled niche networks that were
already successfully spreading hate and anti-vaccination material, to rapidly
become global super-spreaders of narratives featuring fake COVID-19 treatments,
anti-Asian sentiment and conspiracy theories. We derive new tools that
incorporate these coupled social-viral dynamics, including an online $R$, to
help prevent infodemic spreading at all scales: from spreading across platforms
(e.g. Facebook, 4Chan) to spreading within a given subpopulation, or community,
or topic. By accounting for similar social and viral timescales, the same
mathematical theory also offers a quantitative description of other
unconventional infection profiles such as rumors spreading in financial markets
and colds spreading in schools.

derived from the UV to near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and
the far-infrared SEDs for typical dust temperatures of galaxies at these

planar jet flow, coming to the conclusion that their model can generate scaling
laws which go beyond the classical ones. Our comment, however, shows that their
proof-of-concept is flawed and that their newly proposed scaling laws do not go
beyond any classical solutions. Hence, their argument of having established a
new and more advanced turbulence model cannot be confirmed. The problem is
already rooted in the modeling strategy itself, in that a nonphysical
statistical scaling symmetry gets implemented. Breaking this symmetry will
restore the internal consistency and will turn all self-similar solutions back
to the classical ones. To note is that their model also includes a second
nonphysical symmetry. One of the authors already acknowledged this fact for
turbulent jet flow in a formerly published Corrigendum (Sadeghi, Oberlack &

Doctors with a smartphone can leverage the application to save the considerable

approach by the use of Data Augmentation Generative Adversarial Network (DAGAN)

scenarios(Binary/Multiclass) with minimal and noisy data. The model achieved
pinnacle testing accuracy of 99.30% and 98.40% on the two respective scenarios,
making it completely reliable for its users. On top of that a semi-live

connectivity matrices ignoring brain network topology, LOCUS achieves more

notion of equitable list coloring by requiring the subgraph induced by each
color class to be acyclic (instead of edgeless) in addition to the usual upper
bound on the size of each color class. Graph $G$ is equitably $k$-list
arborable if an equitable, arborable list coloring of $G$ exists for every list
assignment for $G$ that associates with each vertex in $G$ a list of $k$
available colors. Zhang conjectured that any graph $G$ is equitably $k$-list
arborable for each $k$ satisfying $k \geq \lceil (1+\Delta(G))/2 \rceil$. We
verify this conjecture for powers of cycles by applying a new lemma which is a
general tool for extending partial equitable, arborable list colorings. We also
propose a stronger version of Zhang's Conjecture for certain connected graphs:
any connected graph $G$ is equitably $k$-list arborable for each $k$ satisfying
$k \geq \lceil \Delta(G)/2 \rceil$ provided $G$ is neither a cycle nor a
complete graph of odd order. We verify this stronger version of Zhang's

necessarily follow that $G$ is equitably $(k+1)$-list arborable which addresses

scenarios thanks to the development of deep neural networks. The original GAN
was proposed based on the non-parametric assumption of the infinite capacity of
networks. However, it is still unknown whether GANs can fit the target
distribution without any prior information. Due to the overconfident
assumption, many issues remain unaddressed in GANs' training, such as
non-convergence, mode collapses, gradient vanishing. Regularization and
normalization are common methods of introducing prior information to stabilize
training and improve discrimination. Although a handful number of
regularization and normalization methods have been proposed for GANs, to the
best of our knowledge, there exists no comprehensive survey that primarily
focuses on objectives and development of these methods, apart from some
in-comprehensive and limited scope studies. In this work, we conduct a
comprehensive survey on the regularization and normalization techniques from
different perspectives of GANs training. First, we systematically describe
different perspectives of GANs training and thus obtain the different
objectives of regularization and normalization. Based on these objectives, we
propose a new taxonomy. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the
mainstream methods on different datasets and investigate the applications of
regularization and normalization techniques that have been frequently employed
in state-of-the-art GANs. Finally, we highlight potential future directions of
research in this domain. Code and studies related to the regularization and
normalization of GANs in this work is summarized on

leading to a strong impact on the electrical grid management. In the case of
Portugal, the contribution of renewable energy sources to the electricity
generation portfolio is already high and the objective is to achieve 100% by
2050. Most of the new renewable generation capacity will be ensured by
distributed photovoltaic generation installed in buildings and therefore the
inherent intermittence of photovoltaic output combined with a mismatch with
demand profile will challenge the operation and resiliency of the electrical
grid. Addressing these issues requires management at the community level and
the leveraging of spatio-temporal flexibility of controllable energy resources,
such as energy storage resources. This is recognized by the regulators in
Portugal and the recent renewable generation self-consumption legislation
enables generation-surplus trading in communities. Implementing intra-community
trading and utilizing the potentials of renewable generation requires oversight
and coordination at the community level in the context of transactive energy
systems. This paper focuses on addressing energy sharing through a transactive
energy market in community microgrids, using stationary and mobile energy
storage as flexibility resources. The proposed framework considers public and
commercial buildings with on-site battery storage and numerous electric vehicle
charging stations. The formulation is assessed using real data from a community
of buildings on a Portuguese University campus. The results showcase that the
proposed method achieves an increase in renewable self-consumption at building

picking in Cainiao, the largest logistics platform in China. Batching orders
together in the picking process to form a single picking route, reduces travel
distance. The reason for its importance is that order picking is a labor
intensive process and, by using good batching methods, substantial savings can
be obtained. The BOBP is a NP-hard combinational optimization problem and
designing a good problem-specific heuristic under the quasi-real-time system
response requirement is non-trivial. In this paper, rather than designing
heuristics, we propose an end-to-end learning and optimization framework named
Balanced Task-orientated Graph Clustering Network (BTOGCN) to solve the BOBP by
reducing it to balanced graph clustering optimization problem. In BTOGCN, a
task-oriented estimator network is introduced to guide the type-aware
heterogeneous graph clustering networks to find a better clustering result
related to the BOBP objective. Through comprehensive experiments on
single-graph and multi-graphs, we show: 1) our balanced task-oriented graph
clustering network can directly utilize the guidance of target signal and

the training of GANs, the focuses of which were respectively put on the loss

and model architectures. Different from the above methods, in this paper, a new
perspective on stabilizing GANs training is presented. It is found that
sometimes the images produced by the generator act like adversarial examples of
the discriminator during the training process, which may be part of the reason
causing the unstable training of GANs. With this finding, we propose the Direct
Adversarial Training (DAT) method to stabilize the training process of GANs.
Furthermore, we prove that the DAT method is able to minimize the Lipschitz

use the coagulation equation to study the evolution of the black hole mass

optimize because of high nonlinearity and variation. This study used a novel
technique, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, to simultaneously optimize
dissolved oxygen and chemical dosage in a WWTP. The reward function was
specially designed from life cycle perspective to achieve sustainable
optimization. Five scenarios were considered: baseline, three different
effluent quality and cost-oriented scenarios. The result shows that
optimization based on LCA has lower environmental impacts compared to baseline
scenario, as cost, energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions reduce to
0.890 CNY/m3-ww, 0.530 kWh/m3-ww, 2.491 kg CO2-eq/m3-ww respectively. The
cost-oriented control strategy exhibits comparable overall performance to the
LCA driven strategy since it sacrifices environmental bene ts but has lower
cost as 0.873 CNY/m3-ww. It is worth mentioning that the retrofitting of WWTPs
based on resources should be implemented with the consideration of impact
transfer. Specifically, LCA SW scenario decreases 10 kg PO4-eq in

significantly increases other indicators. The major contributors of each
indicator are identified for future study and improvement. Last, the author

where the same resources may be accessed by both link types, resulting in
mutual interference. We evaluate the coverage probability and rate of all links
and their interplay to identify the best spectrum sharing mechanism. Among
other things, our results demonstrate that, in scenarios with a large number of
UAV pairs, adopting overlay spectrum sharing seems the most suitable approach
for maintaining a minimum guaranteed rate for UAVs and a high GUE UL
performance. We also find that increasing the density of U2U links degrades
their rates in the overlay-where UAVs only receive interference from other
UAVs-, but not significantly so in the underlay -- where the effect of
GUE-generated interference is dominant.

  Guidance System Architecture","19 pages,11 figures",,,,"cs.OH","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Cell-based crowd evacuation systems provide adaptive or static exit-choice
indications that favor a coordinated group dynamic, improving evacuation time
and safety. While a great effort has been made to modeling its control logic by
assuming an ideal communication and positioning infrastructure, the
architectural dimension and the influence of pedestrian positioning uncertainty
have been largely overlooked. In our previous research, a Cell-based crowd
evacuation system (CellEVAC) was proposed that dynamically allocates exit gates
to pedestrians in a cell-based pedestrian positioning infrastructure. This
system provides optimal exit-choice indications through color-based indications
and a control logic module built upon an optimized discrete-choice model. Here,
we investigate how location-aware technologies and wearable devices can be used
for a realistic deployment of CellEVAC. We consider a simulated real evacuation
scenario (Madrid Arena) and propose a system architecture for CellEVAC that
includes: a controller node, a radio-controlled LED wristband subsystem, and a
cell-node network equipped with active Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)
devices. These subsystems coordinate to provide control, display and
positioning capabilities. We quantitatively study the sensitivity of evacuation
time and safety to uncertainty in the positioning system. Results showed that
CellEVAC was operational within a limited range of positioning uncertainty.
Further analyses revealed that reprogramming the control logic module through a
simulation-optimization process, simulating the positioning system's expected
uncertainty level, improved the CellEVAC performance in scenarios with poor
positioning systems.

(analyzing code that is already written for potential problems). Furthermore,
fertile is designed to educate users on why their mistakes are problematic and

main idea is to learn feature embeddings and derive document embeddings using a
HeteGCN architecture with different graphs used across layers. We simplify
TextGCN by dissecting into several HeteGCN models which (a) helps to study the
usefulness of individual models and (b) offers flexibility in fusing learned
embeddings from different models. In effect, the number of model parameters is
reduced significantly, enabling faster training and improving performance in
small labeled training set scenario. Our detailed experimental studies
demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

target horizons can be of critical importance for decision-making related to
oil and gas exploration and production. An important breakthrough for
industrial applications has been made with the development of industrial
approaches to velocity model building. We propose an extension of these
approaches, sampling an equi-probable contour of the tomography posterior
probability density function (pdf) rather than the full pdf, and using
non-linear slope tomography (rather than standard tomographic migration
velocity analysis as in previous publications). Our approach allows to assess
the quality of uncertainty-related assumptions (linearity and Gaussian
hypothesis within the Bayesian theory) and estimate volumetric migration
positioning uncertainties (a generalization of horizon uncertainties), in
addition to the advantages in terms of efficiency. We derive the theoretical
concepts underlying this approach and unify our derivations with those of
previous publications. As the method works in the full model space rather than
in a preconditioned model space, we split the analysis into the resolved and
unresolved tomography spaces. We argue that the resolved space uncertainties
are to be used in further steps leading to decision-making and can be related
to the output of methods that work in a preconditioned model space. The
unresolved space uncertainties represent a qualitative byproduct specific to
our method, strongly highlighting the most uncertain gross areas, thus useful
for QCs. These concepts are demonstrated on a synthetic data. Complementarily,
the industrial viability of the method is illustrated on two different 3D field
datasets.

  https://tinyurl.com/anavmehtaarchess",,,"cs.HC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Chess game position analysis is important in improving ones game. It requires
entry of moves into a chess engine which is, cumbersome and error prone. We
present ARChessAnalyzer, a complete pipeline from live image capture of a
physical chess game, to board and piece recognition, to move analysis and
finally to Augmented Reality (AR) overlay of the chess diagram position and
move on the physical board. ARChessAnalyzer is like a scene analyzer - it uses
an ensemble of traditional image and vision techniques to segment the scene (ie
the chess game) and uses Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) to predict the
segmented pieces and combine it together to analyze the game. This paper
advances the state of the art in the first of its kind end to end integration
of robust detection and segmentation of the board, chess piece detection using
the fine-tuned AlexNet CNN and chess engine analyzer in a handheld device app.
The accuracy of the entire chess position prediction pipeline is 93.45\% and
takes 3-4.5sec from live capture to AR overlay. We also validated our
hypothesis that ARChessAnalyzer, is faster at analysis than manual entry for
all board positions for valid outcomes. Our hope is that the instantaneous
feedback this app provides will help chess learners worldwide at all levels
improve their game.
