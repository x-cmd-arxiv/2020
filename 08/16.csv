solvable, and for the first time, a family of triple-well potentials with their
whole energy spectrum and wavefunctions using supersymmetry method. It was
suggested since three decades ago that all ""additive"" or ""translational"" shape
invariant superpotentials formed by two combination of functions have been
found and their list was already exhausted by the well-known exactly solvable
potentials that are available in most textbooks and furthermore, there are no
others. We have devised a new family of superpotentials formed by a linear
combination of three functions (two monomials and one rational) and where the
change of parameter function is linear in four parameters. This new family of
potentials with superpotential $W(x,A,B,D,G) = Ax^3 + Bx -\frac{Dx}{1+Gx^2}$
will extend the list of exactly solvable Schr\""odinger equations. We have shown
that the energy of the bound states is rational in the quantum number.
Furthermore, approximating the potential around the central well by a harmonic
oscillator, as a usual practice, is not valid. The two outer wells affect
noticeably the probability density distribution of the excited states. We have
noticed that the populations of the triple-well potentials are localized in the
two outer wells. These results have potential applications to explore more
physical phenomena such as tunneling effect, and instantons dynamics.

Equations for 3D Laplace boundary value problems, using a collocation method
within the Isogeometric Analysis paradigm. In such setting the regular part of
the integrand can be defined as the product of a tensor product B-spline and a
general function. The rules are derived by using first the spline
quasi-interpolation approach to approximate such function and then the
extension of a well known algorithm for spline product to the bivariate
setting. In this way efficiency is ensured, since the locality of any spline
quasi-interpolation scheme is combined with the capability of an ad--hoc
treatment of the B-spline factor. The numerical integration is performed on the
whole support of the B-spline factor by exploiting inter-element continuity of
the integrands

paper. The centralised model is built on client-server architecture, whereas
the decentralised model is based on a peer-to-peer architecture. Blockchain and
InterPlanetary File System have been used for the implementation of the
decentralised system. Potential improvements to make these systems robust have
also been discussed. The methods proposed in this paper for voltage monitoring

number of resources in each of $N$ small interior targets within a
three-dimensional bounded domain. The accumulation of resources is based on
multiple rounds of search-and-capture events; whenever a searcher finds a
target it delivers a resource packet to the target, after which it escapes and
returns to its initial position (resetting after capture). The searcher is then
resupplied with cargo and a new search process is initiated after a random
delay. Assuming that the accumulation of resources is counterbalanced by
degradation, one can derive general expressions for the moments of the resource
distribution. We use this to show that the mean number of resources in a target
is proportional to its effective ""shape capacitance."" We then extend the
analysis to the case of diffusive search with stochastic resetting before
capture, where the position of the searcher is reset to its initial position at
a random sequence of times that is statistically independent of the ongoing
search process, in contrast to the sequence of resetting times after capture.

supporting global efforts to combat COVID-19. The versatility of AI/ML
technologies enables scientists and technologists to address an impressively
broad range of biomedical, epidemiological, and socioeconomic challenges. This
wide-reaching scientific capacity, however, also raises a diverse array of
ethical challenges. The need for researchers to act quickly and globally in
tackling SARS-CoV-2 demands unprecedented practices of open research and
responsible data sharing at a time when innovation ecosystems are hobbled by
proprietary protectionism, inequality, and a lack of public trust. Moreover,
societally impactful interventions like digital contact tracing are raising
fears of surveillance creep and are challenging widely held commitments to
privacy, autonomy, and civil liberties. Prepandemic concerns that data-driven
innovations may function to reinforce entrenched dynamics of societal inequity
have likewise intensified given the disparate impact of the virus on vulnerable
social groups and the life-and-death consequences of biased and discriminatory
public health outcomes. To address these concerns, I offer five steps that need
to be taken to encourage responsible research and innovation. These provide a
practice-based path to responsible AI/ML design and discovery centered on open,
accountable, equitable, and democratically governed processes and products.
When taken from the start, these steps will not only enhance the capacity of
innovators to tackle COVID-19 responsibly, they will, more broadly, help to
better equip the data science and AI/ML community to cope with future pandemics

obtained by a twisted and decorated generalization of the shuffle product,
providing a universal space for separable Volterra equations. As an application
of these algebraic constructions, it is shown that any integral equation with

July - 1999 September to create a secular lightcurve. In order to account for
observer differences, we present a novel algorithm to reduce scatter and
increase precision in a lightcurve compiled from many sources. It is
implemented in a publicly available code, ICQSPLITTER. This code addresses the
differences among observers by using a self-consistent statistical approach,
leading to a sharper lightcurve, and improving the precision of the measured
slopes. To first order, the comet's lightcurve approximately follows a r$^{-4}$
response for both pre- and post-perihelion distances. Interestingly, the
pre-perihelion data are better fit with a fifth-order polynomial with
inflection points at 4.0, 2.6, 2.1 and 1.1 au. We analyze these specific
regions and find that they are associated with physical phenomena in the

for the comet having been in outburst at discovery. Afrho values derived from
the visual lightcurve data are consistent with a r$^{-1.5}$ dependence on
heliocentric distance, which is similar in shape to those derived from
spectroscopy and narrow-band photometry. We present correlation equations for
visual magnitudes and CO and H2O production rates, which are consistent with
the pre-perihelion visual magnitudes increasing almost entirely due to CO
outgassing until a heliocentric distance of about 2.6 - 3.0 au. We also present
two correlation equations that should prove highly useful for observation
planning and data analysis, and can be generalized to be applicable to other

regulation method ({$\Psi$-Net}) to ensure explicit feature information
allocation in different neural network structures. Applying this regulating
method to collaborative models, matchable structures with similar feature
information can be initialized at the very early training stage. During the
federated learning process under either IID or non-IID scenarios, dedicated
collaboration schemes further guarantee ordered information distribution with
definite structure matching, so as the comprehensive model alignment.
Eventually, this framework effectively enhances the federated learning
applicability to extensive heterogeneous settings, while providing excellent
convergence speed, accuracy, and computation/communication efficiency.

play an important role in the analysis and application of dynamic models,
including contagion models and ecological population models. One difficulty in
deriving these quantities is that they must be computed on a model-by-model
basis, since it is typically impractical to obtain general reproduction number
expressions applicable to a family of related models, especially if these are
of different dimensions. For example, this is typically the case for SIR-type
infectious disease models derived using the linear chain trick (LCT). Here we
show how to find general reproduction number expressions for such models
families (which vary in their number of state variables) using the next
generation operator approach in conjunction with the generalized linear chain
trick (GLCT). We further show how the GLCT enables modelers to draw insights
from these results by leveraging theory and intuition from continuous time
Markov chains (CTMCs) and their absorption time distributions (i.e., phase-type
probability distributions). To do this, we first review the GLCT and other
connections between mean-field ODE model assumptions, CTMCs, and phase-type
distributions. We then apply this technique to find reproduction numbers for
two sets of models: a family of generalized SEIRS models of arbitrary finite
dimension, and a generalized family of finite dimensional predator-prey
(Rosenzweig-MacArthur type) models. These results highlight the utility of the
GLCT for the derivation and analysis of mean field ODE models, especially when
used in conjunction with theory from CTMCs and their associated phase-type
distributions.

robustness that encourages the model to be invariant to subgroup differences,
and focus on class information shared by subgroups. Model patching first models
subgroup features within a class and learns semantic transformations between
them, and then trains a classifier with data augmentations that deliberately
manipulate subgroup features. We instantiate model patching with CAMEL, which
(1) uses a CycleGAN to learn the intra-class, inter-subgroup augmentations, and
(2) balances subgroup performance using a theoretically-motivated subgroup
consistency regularizer, accompanied by a new robust objective. We demonstrate
CAMEL's effectiveness on 3 benchmark datasets, with reductions in robust error

polarization-twisted ultrashort laser pulses and the echoes are measured by
exploding the molecules and reconstructing their spatial orientation from the
detected recoil ions momenta. Unlike alignment echoes which are induced by
linearly polarized pulses, here the axial symmetry is broken by the twisted
polarization, giving rise to molecular unidirectional rotation. We find that
the rotation sense of the echo is governed by the twisting sense of the second
pulse even when its intensity is much weaker than the intensity of the first
pulse. In our theoretical study, we rely on classical phase space analysis and
on three-dimensional quantum simulations of the laser-driven molecular
dynamics. Both approaches nicely reproduce the experimental results. Echoes in
general, and the unique UDR echoes in particular, provide new tools for studies
of relaxation processes in dense molecular gases.

considered as the second generation. Although so many methods appeared, people
still believe vorticity is vortex since vorticity theory looks perfect in math,

Recently, Dr. Liu innovated a new vortex identification method called Liutex.
Liutex, a vector quantity, which is regarded as the third-generation method,
not only overcomes all previous methods drawbacks, but also has a clear
physical meaning. The direction of Liutex represents the swirl axis of
rotation, and its strength is equal to twice of angular speed. In this paper,
we did a correlation analysis between vorticity, Q, Lambda ci, Lambda 2 methods

to fit the training data. Whereas conventional statistical wisdom suggests such
models should drastically overfit, in practice these models generalize
remarkably well. An emerging paradigm for describing this unexpected behavior
is in terms of a \emph{double descent} curve, in which increasing a model's
capacity causes its test error to first decrease, then increase to a maximum
near the interpolation threshold, and then decrease again in the
overparameterized regime. Recent efforts to explain this phenomenon
theoretically have focused on simple settings, such as linear regression or
kernel regression with unstructured random features, which we argue are too
coarse to reveal important nuances of actual neural networks. We provide a
precise high-dimensional asymptotic analysis of generalization under kernel
regression with the Neural Tangent Kernel, which characterizes the behavior of
wide neural networks optimized with gradient descent. Our results reveal that
the test error has non-monotonic behavior deep in the overparameterized regime
and can even exhibit additional peaks and descents when the number of
parameters scales quadratically with the dataset size.

exciting and competitive environment, these games routinely attempt to match
players with similar skill levels. Matching players is often accomplished
through a rating system. There has been an increasing amount of research on
developing such rating systems. However, less attention has been given to the
evaluation metrics of these systems. In this paper, we present an exhaustive
analysis of six metrics for evaluating rating systems in online competitive
games. We compare traditional metrics such as accuracy. We then introduce other
metrics adapted from the field of information retrieval. We evaluate these
metrics against several well-known rating systems on a large real-world dataset
of over 100,000 free-for-all matches. Our results show stark differences in
their utility. Some metrics do not consider deviations between two ranks.
Others are inordinately impacted by new players. Many do not capture the
importance of distinguishing between errors in higher ranks and lower ranks.
Among all metrics studied, we recommend Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain
(NDCG) because not only does it resolve the issues faced by other metrics, but
it also offers flexibility to adjust the evaluations based on the goals of the

  An Empirical Investigation","EACL 2021",,,,"cs.CL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Traditional NLP has long held (supervised) syntactic parsing necessary for
successful higher-level semantic language understanding (LU). The recent advent
of end-to-end neural models, self-supervised via language modeling (LM), and
their success on a wide range of LU tasks, however, questions this belief. In
this work, we empirically investigate the usefulness of supervised parsing for
semantic LU in the context of LM-pretrained transformer networks. Relying on
the established fine-tuning paradigm, we first couple a pretrained transformer
with a biaffine parsing head, aiming to infuse explicit syntactic knowledge
from Universal Dependencies treebanks into the transformer. We then fine-tune
the model for LU tasks and measure the effect of the intermediate parsing
training (IPT) on downstream LU task performance. Results from both monolingual
English and zero-shot language transfer experiments (with intermediate
target-language parsing) show that explicit formalized syntax, injected into
transformers through IPT, has very limited and inconsistent effect on
downstream LU performance. Our results, coupled with our analysis of
transformers' representation spaces before and after intermediate parsing, make
a significant step towards providing answers to an essential question: how
(un)availing is supervised parsing for high-level semantic natural language
understanding in the era of large neural models?

contexts. In order to reason about LTLf, formulas are typically compiled into
deterministic finite automata (DFA), as the intermediate semantic
representation. Moreover, due to the fact that DFAs have canonical
representation, efficient minimization algorithms can be applied to maximally
reduce DFA size, helping to speed up subsequent computations. Here, we present
a thorough investigation on two classical minimization algorithms, namely, the
Hopcroft and Brzozowski algorithms. More specifically, we show how to apply
these algorithms to semi-symbolic (explicit states, symbolic transition
functions) automata representation. We then compare the two algorithms in the
context of an LTLf-synthesis framework, starting from LTLf formulas. While
earlier studies on comparing the two algorithms starting from
randomly-generated automata concluded that neither algorithm dominates, our
results suggest that starting from LTLf formulas, Hopcroft's algorithm is the
best choice in the context of reactive synthesis. Deeper analysis explains why

exciton/carrier generation are essential to outstanding optoelectronic
properties of lead halide perovskites (LHPs). A large number of mechanistic
studies in the LHP field to date have focused on contributions to
polarizability from organic cations and the highly polarizable inorganic
lattice. For a comprehensive understanding of the ultrafast polarization
response, we must additionally account for the nearly instantaneous
hyperpolarizability response to the propagating light field itself. While light
propagation is pivotal to optoelectronics and photonics, little is known about
this in LHPs in the vicinity of the bandgap where stimulated emission,
polariton condensation, superfluorescence, and photon recycling may take place.
Here we develop two-dimensional optical Kerr effect (2D-OKE) spectroscopy to
energetically dissect broadband light propagation and dispersive nonlinear
polarization responses in LHPs. In contrast to earlier interpretations, the
below-bandgap OKE responses in both hybrid CH3NH3PbBr3 and all-inorganic
CsPbBr3 perovskites are found to originate from strong hyperpolarizability and
highly anisotropic dispersions. In both materials, the nonlinear mixing of
anisotropically propagating light fields result in convoluted oscillatory
polarization dynamics. Based on a four-wave mixing model, we quantitatively
derive dispersion anisotropies, reproduce 2D-OKE frequency correlations, and
establish polarization dressed light propagation in single crystal LHPs.
Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of distinguishing the
often-neglected anisotropic light propagation from underlying coherent
quasi-particle responses in various forms of ultrafast spectroscopy.

in data communication to photonic neural networks. While tremendous progress
has been made over the years, efficient phase-shifting modulators are
challenged with fundamental tradeoffs, such as voltage-length, index
change-losses or energy-bandwidth, and no single solution available checks all
boxes. While voltage-driven phase modulators, such as based on lithium niobate,
offer low loss and high speed operation, their footprint of 10's of cm-scale is
prohibitively large, especially for density-critical applications, for example
in photonic neural networks. Ignoring modulators for quantum applications,
where loss is critical, here we distinguish between current versus
voltage-driven modulators. We focus on the former, since current-based schemes
of emerging thin electro-optical materials have shown unity-strong index
modulation suitable for heterogeneous integration into foundry waveguides.
Here, we provide an in-depth ab-initio analysis of obtainable modulator
performance based on heterogeneously integrating low-dimensional materials,
i.e. graphene, thin films of indium tin oxide, and transition metal
dichalcogenide monolayers into a plurality of optical waveguide designs atop
silicon photonics. Using the fundamental modulator tradeoff of
energy-bandwidth-product as a design-quality quantifier, we show that a small
modal cross section, such as given by plasmonic modes, enables high-performance
operation, physically realized by arguments on charge-distribution and low
electrical resistance. An in-depth design understanding of phase-modulator

the clustering of matter, and provides an independent cosmological probe
complementary to SN Ia distance measurements. The Nancy Grace Roman Space
Telescope is uniquely sensitive to this measurement as it can discover high
redshift SNe Ia and measure them with high precision. We present a methodology
for reconstructing the probability distribution of the weak lensing
magnification $\mu$ of SNe Ia, $p(\mu)$, from observational data, and using it
to constrain cosmological parameters. We find that the reconstructed $p(\mu)$
can be fitted accurately by a stretched Gaussian distribution, and used to
measure the variance of $\mu$, $\xi_\mu$, which can be compared to theoretical
predictions in a likelihood analysis. Applying our methodology to a set of
realistically simulated SNe Ia expected from the Roman Space Telescope, we find
that using the weak lensing magnification of the SNe Ia constrains a
combination of matter density $\Omega_m$ and matter clustering amplitude
$\sigma_8$. SN Ia distances alone lead to a better than 1\% measurement of
$\Omega_m$. The combination of SN Ia weak lensing magnification and distance
measurements result in a $\sim$ 10\% measurement on $\sigma_8$. The SNe Ia from
Roman will be powerful in constraining the cosmological model.

candidates, since their unusual dispersion shape is predicted to give large
power factors. While previous calculations of these materials have relied on
the assumption of a constant mean-free-path or relaxation time, recent
first-principles modeling of electron-phonon scattering suggests that the
scattering rates may be better approximated by the electron density-of-states
(so-called DOS scattering model). In this work, we use density functional
theory to investigate single and double quintuple-layer Bi$_2$Te$_3$,
Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and Sb$_2$Te$_3$, with a focus on understanding how the three
aforementioned scattering approximations impact thermoelectric performance --
emphasis is placed on the DOS scattering model. The single quintuple-layer
materials possess two ring-shaped valence band maxima that provide an abrupt
increase in conducting channels, which benefits the power factor. Additionally,
below the band edge a ring-shaped minimum, located between the two maxima, is
found to further enhance the thermoelectric performance but only with the DOS
scattering model. This comes from a sharp drop in the DOS, and thus scattering,
just below the ring-shaped minimum. An analytic octic dispersion model is
introduced and shown to qualitatively capture the observed features. The double
quintuple-layer materials display notably worse thermoelectric properties,
since their dispersions are significantly modified compared to the single
quintuple-layer case. The benefits of ring-shaped bands are sensitive to the
alignment of the two ring maxima and to the degree of ring anisotropy. Overall,
single quintuple-layer Bi$_2$Te$_3$ and Bi$_2$Se$_3$ are most promising, with
the DOS scattering model giving the highest power factors.

(SEA) has a huge business impact and attracts a plethora of attention from both
academia and industry. One important goal of advertising is to increase sales.
Nevertheless, while previous research has studied multiple factors that are
potentially related to the outcome of SEA campaigns, effects of these factors
on actual sales generated by SEA remain understudied. It is also unclear
whether and how such effects change over time in highly dynamic SEA campaigns.
As the first empirical investigation of the dynamic advertisement-sales
relationship in SEA, this study builds an advertising response model within a
time-varying coefficient (TVC) modeling framework, and estimates the model
using a unique dataset from a large E-Commerce retailer in the United States.
Results reveal the effects of the advertising expenditure, consumer behaviors
and advertisement characteristics on realized sales, and demonstrate that such
effects on sales do change over time in non-linear ways. More importantly, we
find that carryover has a stronger effect in generating sales than direct
response does, conversion rate is much more important than click-through rate,
and ad position does not have significant effects on sales. These findings have
direct implications for advertisers to launch more effective SEA campaigns.

run a DCE in each country. Participants (149 UK, 94 JP) were shown a series of
two hypothetical VPN apps, varying in features, and were asked to choose one
which they preferred. Customer review rating, followed by price of a VPN app,
significantly affected the decision to choose which VPN app to download and
install. A change from a rating of 3 to 4-5 stars increased the probability of
choosing an app by 33% in the UK and 14% in Japan. Unsurprisingly, price was a
deterrent. Recommendations by friends, source of product reviews, and the
presence of in-app ads also played a role but to a lesser extent. To actually
use a VPN app, participants considered Internet speed, connection stability,
battery level on mobile devices, and the presence of in-app ads as key drivers.

components directly issued from the shock simulation, we obtain key findings
concerning wave excitations at the shock front: (1) at the leading edge of the
foot, two types of electrostatic (ES) waves are observed. The relative drift of
the reflected ions versus the electrons triggers an electron cyclotron drift
instability (ECDI) which excites the first ES wave. Because the bulk velocity
of gyro-reflected ions shifts to the direction of the shock front, the
resulting ES wave propagates oblique to the shock normal. Immediately, a
fraction of incident electrons are accelerated by this ES wave and a ring-like
velocity distribution is generated. They can couple with the hot Maxwellian
core and excite the second ES wave around the upper hybrid frequency. (2) from
the middle of the foot all the way to the ramp, electrons can couple with both
incident and reflected ions. ES waves excited by ECDI in different directions
propagate across each other. Electromagnetic (EM) waves (X mode) emitted toward
upstream are observed in both regions. They are probably induced by a small
fraction of relativistic electrons. Results shed new insight on the mechanism
for the occurrence of ES wave excitations and possible EM wave emissions at
young CME-driven shocks in the near-Sun solar wind.

accurately. The main idea of recent fast ReID methods is the hashing algorithm,
which learns compact binary codes and performs fast Hamming distance and
counting sort. However, a very long code is needed for high accuracy (e.g.
2048), which compromises search speed. In this work, we introduce a new
solution for fast ReID by formulating a novel Coarse-to-Fine (CtF) hashing code
search strategy, which complementarily uses short and long codes, achieving
both faster speed and better accuracy. It uses shorter codes to coarsely rank
broad matching similarities and longer codes to refine only a few top
candidates for more accurate instance ReID. Specifically, we design an
All-in-One (AiO) framework together with a Distance Threshold Optimization
(DTO) algorithm. In AiO, we simultaneously learn and enhance multiple codes of
different lengths in a single model. It learns multiple codes in a pyramid
structure, and encourage shorter codes to mimic longer codes by
self-distillation. DTO solves a complex threshold search problem by a simple
optimization process, and the balance between accuracy and speed is easily
controlled by a single parameter. It formulates the optimization target as a
$F_{\beta}$ score that can be optimised by Gaussian cumulative distribution
functions. Experimental results on 2 datasets show that our proposed method
(CtF) is not only 8% more accurate but also 5x faster than contemporary hashing
ReID methods. Compared with non-hashing ReID methods, CtF is $50\times$ faster

spontaneous electric polarization changes its direction concurrently with the
field-induced magnetic transition, from mostly aligned with the
crystallographic a-axis to the c-axis. To account for such change of
polarization direction, the underlying multiferroic mechanism was proposed to
switch from the spin-current model induced via the inverse
Dzyalloshinskii-Moriya interaction to the p-d hybridization model. We perform a
detailed analysis of the inelastic neutron data of (ND4)2FeCl5D2O using linear
spin-wave theory to quantify magnetic interaction strengths and investigate
possible impact of different multiferroic mechanisms on the magnetic couplings.
Our result reveals that the spin dynamics of both multiferroic phases can be
well-described by a Heisenberg Hamiltonian with an easy-plane anisotropy. We do
not find notable differences between the optimal model parameters of the two
phases. The hierarchy of exchange couplings and the balance among frustrated
interactions remain the same between two phases, suggesting that magnetic
interactions in (ND4)2FeCl5D2O are much more robust than the electric
polarization in response to delicate reorganizations of the electronic degrees

exerted by a thin fiber on the surrounding viscous fluid when the fiber
velocity is prescribed. We term this the slender body inverse problem, as it is
known that slender body theory converges to a well-posed PDE solution when the
force is prescribed and the fiber velocity is unknown. From a PDE perspective,
the slender body inverse problem is simply the Dirichlet problem for the Stokes
equations, but from an approximation perspective, nonlocal slender body theory
exhibits high wavenumber instabilities which complicate analysis. Here we
consider two methods for regularizing the slender body approximation: spectral
truncation and the $\delta$-regularization of Tornberg and Shelley (2004). For
a straight, periodic fiber with constant radius $\epsilon>0$, we explicitly
calculate the spectrum of the operator mapping fiber velocity to force for both
the PDE and the approximations. We show that the spectrum of the original
slender body approximation agrees closely with the PDE solution at low
wavenumbers but differs at high frequencies, allowing us to define a truncated
approximation with a wavenumber cutoff $\sim1/\epsilon$. For both the truncated
and $\delta$-regularized approximations, we obtain similar convergence results
to the PDE solution as $\epsilon\to0$: a fiber velocity with $H^1$ regularity
gives $O(\epsilon)$ convergence, while a fiber velocity with at least $H^2$
regularity yields $O(\epsilon^2)$ convergence. Moreover, we determine the
dependence of the $\delta$-regularized error estimate on the regularization
parameter $\delta$.

contagion, and the linear threshold (LT) model is often applied as a very
representative model for this mechanism. Despite its intensive usage, the LT
model suffers several limitations in describing the time evolution of the
spreading. First, the discrete-time step that captures the speed of the
spreading is vaguely defined. Second, the synchronous updating rule makes the
nodes infected in batches, which can not take individual differences into
account. Finally, the LT model is incompatible with existing models for the
simple contagion. Here we consider a generalized linear threshold (GLT) model
for the continuous-time stochastic complex contagion process that can be
efficiently implemented by the Gillespie algorithm. The time in this model has
a clear mathematical definition and the updating order is rigidly defined. We
find that the traditional LT model systematically underestimates the spreading
speed and the randomness in the spreading sequence order. We also show that the
GLT model works seamlessly with the susceptible-infected (SI) or
susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. One can easily combine them to
model a hybrid spreading process in which simple contagion accumulates the
critical mass for the complex contagion that leads to the global cascades.
Overall, the GLT model we proposed can be a useful tool to study complex
contagion, especially when studying the time evolution of the spreading.

outperforms the conventional approach and achieves a faster imaging speed.

photo-realistic and illumination preserving frontal face synthesis is still
challenging due to large pose and illumination discrepancy during training. We
propose a novel Flow-based Feature Warping Model (FFWM) which can learn to
synthesize photo-realistic and illumination preserving frontal images with
illumination inconsistent supervision. Specifically, an Illumination Preserving
Module (IPM) is proposed to learn illumination preserving image synthesis from
illumination inconsistent image pairs. IPM includes two pathways which
collaborate to ensure the synthesized frontal images are illumination
preserving and with fine details. Moreover, a Warp Attention Module (WAM) is
introduced to reduce the pose discrepancy in the feature level, and hence to
synthesize frontal images more effectively and preserve more details of profile
images. The attention mechanism in WAM helps reduce the artifacts caused by the
displacements between the profile and the frontal images. Quantitative and
qualitative experimental results show that our FFWM can synthesize
photo-realistic and illumination preserving frontal images and performs
favorably against the state-of-the-art results.

some analyzing techniques can be interesting to the readers. For both MFC and
MFG, we provide policy gradient update and show that it converges to the
optimal solution at a linear rate, which is verified by a synthetic simulation.
For MFG, we also provide sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness

briefly introduce nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) in data reduction.
The first two NLDR were respectively published in Science in 2000 in which they
solve the similar reduction problem of high-dimensional data endowed with the
intrinsic nonlinear structure. The intrinsic nonlinear structure is always
interpreted as a concept in manifolds from geometry and topology in theoretical
mathematics by computer scientists and theoretical physicists. In 2001, the
concept of Manifold Learning first appears as an NLDR method called Laplacian
Eigenmaps. In a typical manifold learning setup, the data set, also called the
observation set, is distributed on or near a low dimensional manifold M
embedded in RD, which yields that each observation has a D-dimensional
representation. The goal of manifold learning is to reduce these observations
as a compact lower-dimensional representation based on the geometric
information. The reduction procedure is called the spectral manifold learning.
In this paper, we derive each spectral manifold learning with the matrix and
operator representation, and we then discuss the convergence behavior of each
method in a geometric uniform language. Hence, the survey is named Geometric
Foundations of Data Reduction.

with the classes they have been trained on, which are known as in distribution
inputs. However, out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs pose a great challenge to
DNNs and consequently represent a major risk when DNNs are implemented in
safety-critical systems. Extensive research has been performed in the domain of
OOD detection. However, current state-of-the-art methods for OOD detection
suffer from at least one of the following limitations: (1) increased inference
time - this limits existing methods' applicability to many real-world
applications, and (2) the need for OOD training data - such data can be
difficult to acquire and may not be representative enough, thus limiting the
ability of the OOD detector to generalize. In this paper, we propose FOOD --
Fast Out-Of-Distribution detector -- an extended DNN classifier capable of
efficiently detecting OOD samples with minimal inference time overhead. Our
architecture features a DNN with a final Gaussian layer combined with the log
likelihood ratio statistical test and an additional output neuron for OOD
detection. Instead of using real OOD data, we use a novel method to craft
artificial OOD samples from in-distribution data, which are used to train our
OOD detector neuron. We evaluate FOOD's detection performance on the SVHN,
CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 datasets. Our results demonstrate that in addition to
achieving state-of-the-art performance, FOOD is fast and applicable to
real-world applications.

  Phonetic Edit Distance",,,"10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3137905",,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Lexical Similarity (LS) between two languages uncovers many interesting
linguistic insights such as genetic relationship, mutual intelligibility, and
the usage of one's vocabulary into other. There are various methods through
which LS is evaluated. In the same regard, this paper presents a method of
Phonetic Edit Distance (PED) that uses a soft comparison of letters using the
articulatory features associated with them. The system converts the words into
the corresponding International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), followed by the
conversion of IPA into its set of articulatory features. Later, the lists of
the set of articulatory features are compared using the proposed method. As an
example, PED gives edit distance of German word vater and Persian word pidar as
0.82; and similarly, Hebrew word shalom and Arabic word salaam as 0.93, whereas
for a juxtapose comparison, their IPA based edit distances are 4 and 2
respectively. Experiments are performed with six languages (Arabic, Hindi,
Marathi, Persian, Sanskrit, and Urdu). In this regard, we extracted part of
speech wise word-lists from the Universal Dependency corpora and evaluated the
LS for every pair of language. Thus, with the proposed approach, we find the
genetic affinity, similarity, and borrowing/loan-words despite having script
differences and sound variation phenomena among these languages.

requires fewer floating-point operations (flops) for fire recognition.
Additionally, we propose a portable approach for fire recognition and the use
of modern techniques such as inverted residual block, convolutions like
depth-wise, and octave, to reduce the model's computational cost. The
experiments show that our model keeps high accuracy while substantially
reducing the number of parameters and flops. One of our models presents 71\%
fewer parameters than FireNet, while still presenting competitive accuracy and
AUROC performance. The proposed methods are evaluated on FireNet and FiSmo

is proposed, which allows users to design the passages unlike the STIRAP but
fast and robust against both decoherence and experimental imperfections. Here,
we further develop a more general STIRUP method. Comparing with shortcut to
adiabaticity and its' variants, the generalized STIRUP is more simpler and
compatible with more complex energy-level structure and manybody systems.
Furthermore, the generalized STIRUP has many important applications such as
geometric phase measurement, coherent population transfer, and quantum state

based on a large set of $N$-body simulations that mimic the Subaru HSC-Y1 and
SDSS galaxies, and apply the method to the mock signals to address whether to
recover the underlying true cosmological parameters in the mocks. We find that,
as long as the appropriate scale cuts, $12$ and $8~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$ for
$\Delta\Sigma$ and $w_{\rm p}$ respectively, are adopted, a ""minimal-bias""
model using the linear bias parameter $b_1$ alone and the nonlinear matter
power spectrum can recover the true cosmological parameters (here focused on
$\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_8$) to within the 68% credible interval, for all
the mocks we study including one in which an assembly bias effect is
implemented. This is as expected if physical processes inherent in galaxy
formation/evolution are confined to local, small scales below the scale cut,
and thus implies that real-space observables have an advantage in filtering out
the impact of small-scale nonlinear effects in parameter estimation, compared
to their Fourier-space counterparts. In addition, we find that a theoretical
template including the higher-order bias contributions such as nonlinear bias
parameter $(b_2)$ does not improve the cosmological constraints, but rather
leads to a larger parameter bias compared to the baseline $b_1$-method.

hot and also cooler and denser than the corona. Various mechanisms have been
proposed to explain how jets are primarily attributed to a magnetic
reconnection between the emergence of magnetic flux and environment or that of
twisted photospheric motions that bring the system into a state of instability.
Multi-wavelength observations of a twisted jet observed with AIA and IRIS were
used to understand how the twist was injected into the jet. We followed the
magnetic history of the active region based on the analysis of HMI vector
magnetic field computed with the UNNOFIT code. This region is the result of the
collapse of two emerging magnetic fluxes (EMFs) overlaid by arch filament
systems that have been well-observed with AIA, IRIS, and NVST in H-alpha. In
the magnetic field maps, we found evidence of the pattern of a long sigmoidal
flux rope (FR) along the polarity inversion line between the two EMFs, which is
the site of the reconnection. Before the jet, an extension of the FR was
present and a part of it was detached and formed a small bipole with a bald
patch (BP) region, which dynamically became an X-current sheet over the dome of
one EMF where the reconnection took place. At the time of the reconnection, the
Mg II spectra exhibited a strong extension of the blue wing that is decreasing
over a distance of 10 Mm (from -300 km/s to a few km/s). This is the signature
of the transfer of the twist to the jet. A comparison with numerical
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations confirms the existence of the long FR.
We conjecture that there is a transfer of twist to the jet during the extension
of the FR to the reconnection site without FR eruption. There connection would
start in the low atmosphere in the BP reconnection region and extend at an
X-point along the current sheet formed above.

acquisition from multiple devices with similar functionalities. For such
scenarios, group communication in the form of multicasting and broadcasting has
proven to be effective. Group Key Management (GKM) involves the handling,
revocation, updation and distribution of cryptographic keys to members of
various groups. Classical GKM schemes perform inefficiently in dynamic IoT
environments, which are those wherein nodes frequently leave or join a network
or migrate from one group to another over time. Recently, the `GroupIt' scheme
has been proposed for GKM in dynamic IoT environments. However, this scheme has
several limitations such as vulnerability to collusion attacks, the use of
computationally expensive asymmetric encryption and threats to the backward
secrecy of the system. In this paper, we present a highly efficient and secure
GKM protocol for dynamic IoT settings, which maintains forward and backward
secrecy at all times. Our proposed protocol uses only symmetric encryption, and
is completely resistant to collusion attacks. Also, our protocol is highly
flexible and can handle several new scenarios in which device or user dynamics
may take place, e.g., allowing a device group to join or leave the network or
creation or dissolution of a user group, which are not handled by schemes
proposed in prior literature. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
protocol via extensive mathematical analysis and numerical computations, and
show that it outperforms the GroupIt scheme in terms of the communication and
computation costs incurred by users and devices.

ZeroSpeech Challenge 2019 were models with discrete latent variable such as the
Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (VQVAE). However these models
generate speech with relatively poor quality. In this work we aim to address
this with two approaches: first WaveNet is used as the decoder and to generate
waveform data directly from the latent representation; second, the low
complexity of latent representations is improved with two alternative
disentanglement learning methods, namely instance normalization and sliced
vector quantization. The method was developed and tested in the context of the
recent ZeroSpeech challenge 2020. The system output submitted to the challenge
obtained the top position for naturalness (Mean Opinion Score 4.06), top
position for intelligibility (Character Error Rate 0.15), and third position
for the quality of the representation (ABX test score 12.5). These and further

branch (AGB) phase. In this conventional picture, they must still show strong
circumstellar extinction caused by the dust ejected during the AGB phase, and
the extinction is expected to decrease over time because of the dispersal of
the circumstellar dust after the cessation of the stellar mass loss. The
reduction of the extinction makes the stars become apparently brighter and
bluer with time especially in the near-infrared (NIR) range. We look for such
long-term brightening of non-variable OH/IR stars by using 2MASS, UKIDSS, and
OAOWFC survey data. As a result, we get multi-epoch NIR data taken over a
20-year period (1997-2017) for 6 of 16 non-variable OH/IR stars, and all six
objects are found to be brightening. The K-band brightening rate of five
objects ranges from 0.010 to 0.130 mag yr$^{-1}$, which is reasonably explained
with the conventional picture. However, one OH/IR star, OH31.0-0.2, shows a
rapid brightening, which cannot be explained only by the dispersal of the dust
shell. Multi-color (J-, H-, and K-band) data are obtained for three objects,
OH25.1-0.3, OH53.6-0.2, and OH77.9+0.2. Surprisingly, none of them appears to
have become bluer, and OH53.6-0.2 is found to have been reddened with a rate of

still a deficiency in this scheme. Through experiments, we found that the

straightly depends on the parameters designed beforehand for the GDDF, which
causes a lack of adaptability to the practical applications of this method. In
this paper, a modified scheme of GDDF with consideration of margins (MGDDF) is
proposed. This MGDDF scheme is based on quadratic programming (QP) framework,
which is widely applied to solving the redundancy resolution problems of robot
arms. Moreover, three margins are introduced in the proposed MGDDF scheme to
avoid joint limits. With consideration of these margins, the joints of
manipulators of the humanoid robots will not exceed their limits, and the
potential damages which might be caused by exceeding limits will be completely
avoided. Computer simulations conducted on MATLAB further verify the

implementing Bayesian Networks (BNs), a widely accepted class of multivariate

valuable features of the proposed schemes. In addition to the preservation of
physical structures, such as positivity, mass conservation, discrete energy
dissipation, blue and steady states, numerical simulations further reveal that
our numerical schemes are capable of solving \emph{degenerate} cases of the
Fokker--Planck equations effectively and robustly. It is shown that the
developed numerical schemes have convergence order even in degenerate cases
with the presence of solutions having compact support, can accurately and
robustly compute the waiting time of free boundaries without any oscillation,
and can approximate blow-up singularity up to machine precision.

for localised shear deformation to occur on the sensor surface for a
significant duration prior to the onset of gross slip. By detecting incipient

useful because a corrective action can be taken before slippage occurs across
the entire contact area thus minimising the risk of objects been dropped.

resource allocation and packet scheduling scheme for different Quality of

addition, regarding the scarcity of spectrum in below 6GHz bands, the proposed
algorithm dynamically allocates the resource blocks (RBs) to licensed users in
a way to mostly preserve the continuity of unallocated RBs. This would improve
the efficiency of communication among the unlicensed entities by increasing the
chance of uninterrupted communication and reducing the load of coordination
overheads. The optimization problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP), observing the entire queue of the demands, where failing to meet QoS
constraints penalizes the goal with a multiplicative factor. Furthermore, a
notion of continuity for unallocated resources is taken into account as an
additive term in the objective function. Considering the variations in both
channel coefficients and users requests, we utilize a deep reinforcement
learning algorithm as an online and numerically efficient approach to solve the
MDP. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves higher average
spectral efficiency, while considering delay budget and packet loss ratio,
compared to the conventional greedy min-delay and max-throughput schemes, in
which a fixed part of the spectrum is forced to be vacant for unlicensed

we propose a Deep Co-Interactive Relation Network (DCR-Net) to explicitly

caching status and maximum biased received power is proposed by considering the
spatial correlation caused by the coexistence of base stations (BSs) and relay
nodes (RNs). A joint UAR and caching placement problem is then formulated to
maximize the backhaul offloading traffic. Using stochastic geometry tools, we
decouple the joint UAR and caching placement problem by analyzing the
relationship between UAR probabilities and caching placement probabilities. We
then optimize the transformed caching placement problem based on polyblock
outer approximation by exploiting the monotonic property in the general case
and utilizing convex optimization in the noise-limited case. Accordingly, we
propose a BS and RN selection algorithm where caching status at BSs and maximum
biased received power are jointly considered. Experimental results demonstrate
a significant enhancement of backhaul offloading using the proposed algorithms,
and show that deploying more RNs and increasing cache size in mmWave networks
is a more cost-effective alternative than increasing BS density to achieve
similar backhaul offloading performance.

challenge to employ FPM for digital pathology applications, where resolution
and color accuracy are of critical importance. Here we report a deep learning
approach for performing unsupervised image-to-image translation of FPM

withholding attack is one of them: one strategic pool manager sends some of her
miners to other pools and these miners pretend to work on the puzzles but
actually do nothing. And these miners still get reward since the pool manager
can not recognize these malicious miners. In this work, we revisit the

each other. Ideally, natural language should also be usable for communicating
goals to autonomous machines (e.g., robots) to minimize friction in task
specification. However, understanding and mapping natural language goals to
sequences of states and actions is challenging. Specifically, existing work
along these lines has encountered difficulty in generalizing learned policies
to new natural language goals and environments. In this paper, we propose a
novel adversarial inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a
language-conditioned policy and reward function. To improve generalization of
the learned policy and reward function, we use a variational goal generator to
relabel trajectories and sample diverse goals during training. Our algorithm
outperforms multiple baselines by a large margin on a vision-based natural
language instruction following dataset (Room-2-Room), demonstrating a promising
advance in enabling the use of natural language instructions in specifying
agent goals.

Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) is a class of cyberattacks against power grid
monitoring systems. Adversaries can successfully perform FDIAs in order to
manipulate the power system State Estimation (SE) by compromising sensors or
modifying system data. SE is an essential process performed by the Energy
Management System (EMS) towards estimating unknown state variables based on
system redundant measurements and network topology. SE routines include Bad
Data Detection (BDD) algorithms to eliminate errors from the acquired
measurements, e.g., in case of sensor failures. FDIAs can bypass BDD modules to
inject malicious data vectors into a subset of measurements without being
detected, and thus manipulate the results of the SE process. In order to
overcome the limitations of traditional residual-based BDD approaches,
data-driven solutions based on machine learning algorithms have been widely
adopted for detecting malicious manipulation of sensor data due to their fast

model to describe the condensed matter by the strong interaction (i.e., strong
condensed matter) in both 2-flavoured (nucleons) and 3-flavoured (hyperons,
strangeons, etc.) scenarios. The model parameters are calibrated to reproduce
the saturation properties of nuclear matter, which are later applied to hyperon
matter and strangeon matter. Compared with baryon matter, the derived energy
per baryon of strangeon matter is reduced if the strangeon carries a large
number of valence quarks, which stiffens the equation of state and consequently
increases the maximum mass of strangeon stars. In a large parameter space, the
maximum mass and tidal deformability of strangeon stars predicted by the linked
bag model are consistent with the current astrophysical constraints. It is
found that the maximum mass of strangeon stars can be as large as $\sim

lies in the range of $180\lesssim \Lambda_{1.4} \lesssim 340$.

tackling real-world challenges, and in particular transferring such theory to
neuromorphic systems for low-power embedded applications. Motivated by this, we
propose a new supervised learning method that can train multilayer spiking
neural networks to solve classification problems based on a rapid,
first-to-spike decoding strategy. The proposed learning rule supports multiple
spikes fired by stochastic hidden neurons, and yet is stable by relying on
first-spike responses generated by a deterministic output layer. In addition to
this, we also explore several distinct, spike-based encoding strategies in
order to form compact representations of presented input data. We demonstrate
the classification performance of the learning rule as applied to several
benchmark datasets, including MNIST. The learning rule is capable of
generalising from the data, and is successful even when used with constrained
network architectures containing few input and hidden layer neurons.
Furthermore, we highlight a novel encoding strategy, termed `scanline
encoding', that can transform image data into compact spatiotemporal patterns
for subsequent network processing. Designing constrained, but optimised,
network structures and performing input dimensionality reduction has strong
implications for neuromorphic applications.

systems such as human interactions, transport networks, biological

important aspect of the evolution of temporal networks. To analyse networks,
they are mapped to adjacency matrices, however, a single adjacency matrix
cannot represent complex relationships (e.g. temporal pattern), and therefore,
some approaches consider a simplified representation of temporal networks but
in high-dimensional and generally sparse matrices. As a result, adjacency
matrices cannot be directly used by machine learning models for making network
or node level predictions. To overcome this problem, automated frameworks are
proposed for learning low-dimensional vectors for nodes or edges, as
state-of-the-art techniques in predicting temporal patterns in networks such as
link prediction. However, these models fail to consider temporal dimensions of
the networks. This gap motivated us to propose in this research a new node
embedding technique which exploits the evolving nature of the networks
considering a simple three-layer graph neural network at each time step, and
extracting node orientation by Given's angle method. To prove our proposed

permutations of $N$ elements. Specifically we study one-parameter vector
fields, up to cubic order, which commute with the standard real
$(N-1)$-dimensional irreducible representation of $S_N$. The parameter is the
linearization at the trivial 1-cluster equilibrium of total synchrony.
  All equilibria are cluster solutions involving up to three clusters. The
resulting global dynamics is of gradient type: all bounded solutions are
cluster equilibria and heteroclinic orbits between them. In the limit of large
$N$, we present a detailed analysis of the web of heteroclinic orbits among the
plethora of 2-cluster equilibria. Our focus is on the global dynamics of
3-cluster solutions with one rebel cluster of small size. These solutions
describe slow relative growth and decay of 2-cluster states. For
$N\rightarrow\infty$, the limiting heteroclinic web defines an integrable
\emph{rebel flow} in the space of 2-cluster equilibrium configurations. We
identify and study the seven qualitatively distinct global rebel flows which
arise in this setting.
  Applications include oscillators with all-to-all coupling, and
electrochemistry. For illustration we consider synchronization clusters among
$N$ complex Stuart-Landau oscillators with complex linear global coupling.

High-field inductively-detected Ga-71 NMR was performed with samples immersed
in superfluid He to investigate the effects of continuous-wave near band-edge
optical illumination on lattice nuclear spins in the ferromagnetic phase. The
photon energy dependence of the light-induced NMR signals for GaAs and the
GaMnAs film samples were recorded using circularly polarized light.
Interpretation of the data was guided by electronic band structure calculations
using the k.p method in the presence of an external magnetic field using the
modified 8-band Pidgeon-Brown model. The photon energy dependence of the NMR
transition intensity exhibited a shift of the absorption band edge; invariance
with respect to the sense of helicity of the exciting light; and an absence of
oscillations in the photon energy dependence, all of which are consistent with
theoretical predictions. The dynamics of the optically activated NMR
experiments was investigated by variable optical intensity studies and
light/dark modulated optical pumping experiments. This is because doping with
Mn (a p-type dopant) can push the Fermi level deep into the valence bands and
block the optical transitions (Burstein-Moss effect) needed to create spin
polarized electrons. Additionally, the calculated enhancement of the conduction
electron g-factor by over two orders of magnitude is expected to quench the
electron-nuclear spin angular moment transfer, which impedes the
hyperpolarization of lattice nuclei. Experiments with variable light intensity
and optical gating reveal a mechanism consistent with light-induced quadrupolar
relaxation, a process that will certainly interfere with the optical transfer
and storage of quantum information in the lattice nuclear spin states in this
material.

especially when the network is under pressure. We present DLCP, a novel
solution exploiting the domain-specific properties of deep learning to optimize
communication overhead of DNN training in a fine-grained manner. At its heart,
DLCP comprises of several key innovations beyond prior work: e.g., it exploits
{\em bounded loss tolerance} of SGD-based training to improve tail
communication latency which cannot be avoided purely through gradient
compression. It then performs fine-grained packet-level prioritization and
dropping, as opposed to flow-level scheduling, based on layers and magnitudes
of gradients to further speedup model convergence without affecting accuracy.
In addition, it leverages inter-packet order-independency to perform per-packet
load balancing without causing classical re-ordering issues. DLCP works with
both Parameter Server and collective communication routines. We have
implemented DLCP with commodity switches, integrated it with various training
frameworks including TensorFlow, MXNet and PyTorch, and deployed it in our
small-scale testbed with 10 Nvidia V100 GPUs. Our testbed experiments and
large-scale simulations show that DLCP delivers up to $84.3\%$ additional
training acceleration over the best existing solutions.

coordinate activities of multiple spacecraft. The satellite task planning
problem entails selecting actions that best satisfy mission objectives for

assisted by heuristic or rule-based planning tools. This approach does not
efficiently scale to multiple assets as heuristics frequently fail to properly

problem becomes more difficult to solve for large constellations as the
complexity of the problem scales exponentially in the number of requested
observations and linearly in the number of spacecraft. It is expected that new
commercial optical and radar imaging constellations will require automated
planning methods to meet stated responsiveness and throughput objectives. This
paper introduces a new approach for solving the satellite scheduling problem by
generating an infeasibility-based graph representation of the problem and
finding a maximal independent set of vertices for the graph. The approach is
tested on a scenarios of up to 10,000 requested imaging locations for the
Skysat constellation of optical satellites as well as simulated constellations

capture the nonlocal response of the medium by introducing nonlocal kinematic
relations. First, we use the geometrically nonlinear fractional-order kinematic
relations within an energy-based approach to establish the Lagrange-Dirichlet
stability criteria for fractional-order nonlocal structures. This energy-based
approach to nonlocal structural stability is possible due to a
positive-definite and thermodynamically consistent definition of deformation
energy enabled by the fractional-order kinematic formulation. Then, the
Rayleigh-Ritz coefficient for the critical load is derived for linear buckling
conditions. The fractional-order formulation is finally used to determine
critical buckling loads of slender nonlocal beams and plates using a dedicated
fractional-order finite element solver. Results establish that, in contrast to
existing studies, the effect of nonlocal interactions is observed on both the
material and the geometric stiffness, when using the fractional-order
