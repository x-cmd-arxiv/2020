  Very High Permittivity Dielectric Resonators with a Contained Aqueous
  Solution","10 pages, 11 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  An ab-initio analysis based on coupled mode theory (CMT) is applied to
describe the interaction dynamics of high dielectric resonators (DRs) with its
containing aqueous solution. We prove that the coupling mechanism is
reciprocal. Such property is exploited to find closed form and accurate
expressions of the coupling coefficient, the main factor characterizing the
system performance. Based on such expressions, it is shown that, for wireless
power transfer (WPT) applications, up sizing the DRs relaxes the need of using
ultra high dielectric constant materials. The nature of interaction is captured
by the coupling matrix, which shows that the behaviour of the system is
identical to the ones studied extensively in the literature when the contained
aqueous solution is replaced by an enclosing cavity. It follows, as in a
typical three coupled resonators setting, that when two DRs are inserted in the
aqueous solution a non-bonding mode emerges; hence enabling efficient wireless
power transfer (WPT) via the opening of an electromagnetic induced transparency
like window. Due to the inevitable situations where the DRs are not
symmetrically placed inside the solution, the general eigenvalue problem, with
asymmetrically placed DR inserts is solved and the eigenvectors representing
the coupled modes are depicted by vectors in a 3D mathematical space where the
uncoupled modes represent its basis. Moreover, the strong coupling between the
DR inserts and the aqueous medium allows the proposed WPT system to tolerate
intrinsic aqueous solution losses and the presence of extraneous objects.
Additionally, the value of the load at maximum efficiency is independent of the
aqueous solution loss tangent, thus tolerating the variation of the medium
salinity. The Proposed EIT like scheme can find applications for mid/short
range power transfer in/through swimming pools, chemical reactors, fish tanks,
etc.

is shown to incur performance detriment especially on node classification. The
main cause of this lies in over-smoothing. The over-smoothing issue drives the
output of GCN towards a space that contains limited distinguished information
among nodes, leading to poor expressivity. Several works on refining the
architecture of deep GCN have been proposed, but it is still unknown in theory
whether or not these refinements are able to relieve over-smoothing. In this
paper, we first theoretically analyze how general GCNs act with the increase in
depth, including generic GCN, GCN with bias, ResGCN, and APPNP. We find that
all these models are characterized by a universal process: all nodes converging
to a cuboid. Upon this theorem, we propose DropEdge to alleviate over-smoothing
by randomly removing a certain number of edges at each training epoch.
Theoretically, DropEdge either reduces the convergence speed of over-smoothing
or relieves the information loss caused by dimension collapse. Experimental
evaluations on simulated dataset have visualized the difference in
over-smoothing between different GCNs. Moreover, extensive experiments on
several real benchmarks support that DropEdge consistently improves the
performance on a variety of both shallow and deep GCNs.

artificial agents - a Sender and a Receiver. These agents synergistically
cooperate using emergent symbolic language to solve the task of semantic
segmentation. Our game theoretic approach is to model the cooperation between
agents unlike Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The Sender retrieves
information from one of the higher layers of the deep network and generates a
symbolic sentence sampled from a categorical distribution of vocabularies. The
Receiver ingests the stream of symbols and cogenerates the segmentation mask. A
private emergent language is developed that forms the communication channel
used to describe the task of segmentation of COVID infections. We augment
existing state of the art semantic segmentation architectures with our symbolic
generator to form symbolic segmentation models. Our symbolic segmentation
framework achieves state of the art performance for segmentation of lung

symbolic sentences to discriminate between normal and infected regions,
infection morphology and image characteristics. We show state of the art

two fundamental modules in industrial ranking systems such as recommender

than CTR (known as the CVR data sparsity problem), most of the existing works
try to leverage CTR&CVR multi-task learning to improve CVR performance.
However, typical coarse-grained sub-network/layer sharing methods may introduce
conflicts and lead to performance degradation, since not every neuron or neuron
connection in one layer should be shared between CVR and CTR tasks. This is
because users may have different fine-grained content feature preferences
between deep consumption and click behavior, represented by CVR and CTR,
respectively. To address this sharing&conflict problem, we propose a novel
multi-task CVR modeling scheme with neuron-connection level sharing named
NCS4CVR, which can automatically and flexibly learn which neuron weights are
shared or not shared without artificial experience. Compared with previous
layer-level sharing methods, this is the first time that a fine-grained CTR&CVR

site-selective techniques such as photoluminescence (PL), and radioluminescence

preserve distances of the original graph. While there has been an extensive
amount of work on additive spanners, so far little attention was given to
weighted graphs. Only very recently [ABSKS20] extended the classical +2
(respectively, +4) spanners for unweighted graphs of size $O(n^{3/2})$ (resp.,
$O(n^{7/5})$) to the weighted setting, where the additive error is $+2W$
(resp., $+4W$). This means that for every pair $u,v$, the additive stretch is
at most $+2W_{u,v}$, where $W_{u,v}$ is the maximal edge weight on the shortest
$u-v$ path. In addition, [ABSKS20] showed an algorithm yielding a $+8W_{max}$
spanner of size $O(n^{4/3})$, here $W_{max}$ is the maximum edge weight in the
entire graph.
  In this work we improve the latter result by devising a simple deterministic
algorithm for a $+(6+\varepsilon)W$ spanner for weighted graphs with size
$O(n^{4/3})$ (for any constant $\varepsilon>0$), thus nearly matching the
classical +6 spanner of size $O(n^{4/3})$ for unweighted graphs. Furthermore,
we show a $+(2+\varepsilon)W$ subsetwise spanner of size $O(n\cdot\sqrt{|S|})$,
improving the $+4W_{max}$ result of [ABSKS20] (that had the same size). We also
show a simple randomized algorithm for a $+4W$ emulator of size
$\tilde{O}(n^{4/3})$.
  In addition, we show that our technique is applicable for very sparse
additive spanners, that have linear size. For weighted graphs, we use a variant
of our simple deterministic algorithm that yields a linear size
$+\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n}\cdot W)$ spanner, and we also obtain a tradeoff between
size and stretch.
  Finally, generalizing the technique of [DHZ00] for unweighted graphs, we
devise an efficient randomized algorithm producing a $+2W$ spanner for weighted

approach results in substantially concise nets, having $100 \times$ fewer

to acquire, can also be used as inductive biases for algorithms to learn more
interpretable or alternative disentangled representations. To this end, we
propose WeLa-VAE, a variational inference framework where observations and
labels share the same latent variables, which involves the maximization of a
modified variational lower bound and total correlation regularization. Our
method is a generalization of TCVAE, adding only one extra hyperparameter. We
experiment on a dataset generated by Cartesian coordinates and we show that,
while a TCVAE learns a factorized Cartesian representation, given weak labels
of distance and angle, WeLa-VAE is able to learn and disentangle a polar
representation. This is achieved without the need of refined labels or having
to adjust the number of layers, the optimization parameters, or the total
correlation hyperparameter.

compensated by obtaining pseudo-labels of data using a graph-based clustering
approach. The pseudo-labels are used to form triplets of examples, which guide
the metric learning. We propose a probabilistic loss that minimizes the chances
of each triplet violating an angular constraint. A weight function, and an
orthogonality constraint in the objective speeds up the convergence and avoids
a model collapse. We also provide a stochastic formulation of our method to

Autoregressive (VAR) model from 1-bit measurements are introduced. They are
based on the Yule-Walker scheme modified to account for quantisation. The
scalar case has been studied before. The main difficulty when going from the
scalar to the vector case is how to estimate the ratios of the variances of
pairwise components of the VAR model. The first method overcomes this
difficulty by requiring the quantisation to be non-symmetric: each component of
the VAR model output is replaced by a binary ""zero"" or a binary ""one"" depending
on whether its value is greater than a strictly positive threshold. Different
components of the VAR model can have different thresholds. As the choice of
these thresholds has a strong influence on the performance, this first method
is best suited for applications where the variance of each time series is
approximately known prior to choosing the corresponding threshold. The second
method relies instead on symmetric quantisations of not only each component of
the VAR model but also on the pairwise differences of the components. These
additional measurements are equivalent to a ranking of the instantaneous VAR
model output, from the smallest component to the largest component. This avoids
the need for choosing thresholds but requires additional hardware for
quantising the components in pairs. Numerical simulations show the efficiency
of both schemes.

promise in several text classification scenarios. In this work, we argue that
by not using any labelled data, data programming based approaches can yield
sub-optimal performances, particularly when the labelling functions are noisy.
The first contribution of this work is an introduction of a framework, \model
which is a semi-supervised data programming paradigm that learns a \emph{joint
model} that effectively uses the rules/labelling functions along with
semi-supervised loss functions on the feature space. Next, we also study
\modelss which additionally does subset selection on top of the joint
semi-supervised data programming objective and \emph{selects} a set of examples
that can be used as the labelled set by \model. The goal of \modelss is to
ensure that the labelled data can \emph{complement} the labelling functions,
thereby benefiting from both data-programming as well as appropriately selected
data for human labelling. We demonstrate that by effectively combining
semi-supervision, data-programming, and subset selection paradigms, we
significantly outperform the current state-of-the-art on seven publicly

dissipation of kinetic energy of the ball into the plate. However this
dissipated energy can come back into ball in its later bounces. We see the
emergence of super-elastic collisions ($\epsilon > 1$), implying that the ball
gained Kinetic Energy due to the collision with the plate. We can increase the

interest in the development of new methods to combat infectious diseases. A
prominent property of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission is the significant fraction
of asymptomatic transmission. This may influence the effectiveness of the
standard contact tracing procedure for quarantining potentially infected
individuals. However, the effects of asymptomatic transmission on the epidemic
threshold of epidemic spreading on networks are largely unknown. Here we study
the critical percolation transition in a simple epidemic network model in the
presence of a recursive contact tracing algorithm for instant quarantining. We
find that, above a certain fraction of asymptomatic transmission, standard
contact tracing loses its ability to suppress spreading below the epidemic
threshold. However, we also find that recursive contact tracing opens a
possibility to contain epidemics with a large fraction of asymptomatic or
presymptomatic transmission. In particular, we calculate the required fraction
of network nodes participating in the contact tracing for networks with
arbitrary degree distributions and for varying recursion depths and discuss the
influence of recursion depth and asymptomatic rate on the epidemic percolation
phase transition. We test and illustrate our theoretical results using
numerical simulations on infection trees and networks. We anticipate recursive
contact tracing to provide a basis for digital, app-based contact tracing tools

operate over a wide range of vibration frequencies. In this case the sensor
will be unresponsive to specific frequencies of wire vibration, which are
determined by the placement of the sensor. This means that for the instrument
to be robust, the sensor must be precisely mobile, or multiple sensors must be
used.
  Here a technique which may be used to supplement the displacement sensor is
described. This technique makes use of the voltage generated by the motion of
the wire in the magnetic field under measurement. It is predicted that the
technique may be more suitable for measurements requiring high frequency
vibration, and is sensitive to all frequencies of vibration. Measurements of a
magnetic field obtained using this technique are compared to those found using
only a displacement sensor, and the benefits and drawbacks of the technique are
discussed.

However, other possible conduction channels, such as a trivial two-dimensional
electron gas (2DEG) with strong Rashba type spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and
bulk conducting states that may possess a spin Hall effect (SHE), can coexist
in 3D TIs, making determining the origin of the current induced spin
polarization (CISP) difficult. In this work, we directly compared the CISP
between bulk-insulating Bi2Te2Se (BTS221) and bulk-metallic Bi2Se3 thin flakes
using spin potentiometry. In the bulk insulating BTS221, the observed CISP has
a sign consistent with the expected helicity of the SML of the TSS, but an
opposite sign to its calculated bulk spin Hall conductivity (SHC). However,
compared to BTS221, an opposite CISP is observed in the bulk metallic Bi2Se3,
consistent instead with both the expectations of its Rashba-Edelstein effect of
the band-bending induced 2DEG and bulk spin Hall Effect (SHE). Our results

model which uses incremental cluster validity indices (iCVIs) to perform
unsupervised learning, namely iCVI-ARTMAP. Incorporating iCVIs to the
decision-making and many-to-one mapping capabilities of ARTMAP can improve the
choices of clusters to which samples are incrementally assigned. These
improvements are accomplished by intelligently performing the operations of
swapping sample assignments between clusters, splitting and merging clusters,
and caching the values of variables when iCVI values need to be recomputed.
Using recursive formulations enables iCVI-ARTMAP to considerably reduce the
computational burden associated with cluster validity index (CVI)-based offline
clustering. Depending on the iCVI and the data set, it can achieve running
times up to two orders of magnitude shorter than when using batch CVI
computations. In this work, the incremental versions of Calinski-Harabasz,
WB-index, Xie-Beni, Davies-Bouldin, Pakhira-Bandyopadhyay-Maulik, and
negentropy increment were integrated into fuzzy ARTMAP. Experimental results
show that, with proper choice of iCVI, iCVI-ARTMAP outperformed fuzzy adaptive
resonance theory (ART), dual vigilance fuzzy ART, kmeans, spectral clustering,
Gaussian mixture models and hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithms in
most of the synthetic benchmark data sets. It also performed competitively on
real world image benchmark data sets when clustering on projections and on
latent spaces generated by a deep clustering model. Naturally, the performance
of iCVI-ARTMAP is subject to the selected iCVI and its suitability to the data
at hand; fortunately, it is a general model wherein other iCVIs can be easily
embedded.

Effective urban planning can help to mitigate the operational and social

But, human planners take longer time. The recent advance of deep learning
motivates us to ask: can machines learn at a human capability to automatically
and quickly calculate land-use configuration, so human planners can finally
adjust machine-generated plans for specific needs? To this end, we formulate
the automated urban planning problem into a task of learning to configure
land-uses, given the surrounding spatial contexts. To set up the task, we
define a land-use configuration as a longitude-latitude-channel tensor, where
each channel is a category of POIs and the value of an entry is the number of
POIs. The objective is then to propose an adversarial learning framework that
can automatically generate such tensor for an unplanned area. In particular, we
first characterize the contexts of surrounding areas of an unplanned area by
learning representations from spatial graphs using geographic and human
mobility data. Second, we combine each unplanned area and its surrounding
context representation as a tuple, and categorize all the tuples into positive
(well-planned areas) and negative samples (poorly-planned areas). Third, we
develop an adversarial land-use configuration approach, where the surrounding
context representation is fed into a generator to generate a land-use
configuration, and a discriminator learns to distinguish among positive and
negative samples.

of the art methods in combinatorial optimization and related sampling tasks. We
argue for continued exploration and interest in the QA framework on the basis
that improved coherence times and control capabilities will enable the
near-term exploration of several heuristic quantum optimization algorithms that
have been introduced in the literature. These continuous-time Hamiltonian
computation algorithms rely on control protocols that are more advanced than
those in traditional ground-state QA, while still being considerably simpler
than those used in gate-model implementations. The inclusion of coherent
diabatic transitions to excited states results in a generalization called
diabatic quantum annealing (DQA), which we argue for as the most promising
route to quantum enhancement within this framework. Other promising variants of
traditional QA include reverse annealing and continuous-time quantum walks, as
well as analog analogues of parameterized quantum circuit ansatzes for machine
learning. Most of these algorithms have no known (or likely to be discovered)
efficient classical simulations, and in many cases have promising (but limited)
early signs for the possibility of quantum speedups, making them worthy of
further investigation with quantum hardware in the intermediate-scale regime.
We argue that all of these protocols can be explored in a state-of-the-art
manner by embracing the full range of novel out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics
generated by time-dependent effective transverse-field Ising Hamiltonians that
can be natively implemented by, e.g., inductively-coupled flux qubits, both

applications such as image classification and semantic segmentation and is
especially important for applications where memory storage is limited. However,
when aiming for quantization without accuracy degradation, different tasks may
end up with different bitwidths. This creates complexity for software and
hardware support and the complexity accumulates when one considers
mixed-precision quantization, in which case each layer's weights use a
different bitwidth. Our key insight is that optimizing for the least bitwidth
subject to no accuracy degradation is not necessarily an optimal strategy. This
is because one cannot decide optimality between two bitwidths if one has a
smaller model size while the other has better accuracy. In this work, we take
the first step to understand if some weight bitwidth is better than others by
aligning all to the same model size using a width-multiplier. Under this
setting, somewhat surprisingly, we show that using a single bitwidth for the
whole network can achieve better accuracy compared to mixed-precision
quantization targeting zero accuracy degradation when both have the same model
size. In particular, our results suggest that when the number of channels
becomes a target hyperparameter, a single weight bitwidth throughout the

significantly in the last decade, reaching a point where the task attracts much
more attention than ever before. This study compiles the state of the art in a
concise way to help advance the field and reveal open questions. Moreover, all
of this meta study's source data is made public, easing future work with it and
further expansion. The analyzed papers have been manually labeled with a set of
categories. The data reveals many insights, such as, among others, shifts in
the field from intrusive to non-intrusive capturing, from local to global
features and the lack of non-manual parameters included in medium and larger
vocabulary recognition systems. Surprisingly, RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather with a

convex-concave saddle point problems (SPP). At each iteration, a cubic
regularized saddle point subproblem is constructed and solved, which provides a
search direction for the iterate. With properly chosen stepsizes, the method is
shown to converge to the saddle point with global linear and local superlinear
convergence rates, if the saddle point function is gradient Lipschitz and
strongly-convex-strongly-concave. In the case that the function is merely
convex-concave, we propose a homotopy continuation (or path-following) method.
Under a Lipschitz-type error bound condition, we present an iteration
complexity bound of $\mathcal{O}\left(\ln \left(1/\epsilon\right)\right)$ to
reach an $\epsilon$-solution through a homotopy continuation approach, and the
iteration complexity bound becomes
$\mathcal{O}\left(\left(1/\epsilon\right)^{\frac{1-\theta}{\theta^2}}\right)$

measure on the collection of all independent sets of $G$, that assigns to each
independent set $I$ a probability proportional to $\lambda^{|I|}$. In this
paper we consider the problem of estimating the parameter $\lambda$ given a
single sample from the hardcore model on a graph $G$. To bypass the
computational intractability of the maximum likelihood method, we use the
maximum pseudo-likelihood (MPL) estimator, which for the hardcore model has a
surprisingly simple closed form expression. We show that for any sequence of
graphs $\{G_N\}_{N\geq 1}$, where $G_N$ is a graph on $N$ vertices, the MPL
estimate of $\lambda$ is $\sqrt N$-consistent, whenever the graph sequence has
uniformly bounded average degree. We then derive sufficient conditions under
which the MPL estimate of the activity parameters is $\sqrt N$-consistent given
a single sample from a general $H$-coloring model, in which restrictions
between adjacent colors are encoded by a constraint graph $H$. We verify the
sufficient conditions for models where there is at least one unconstrained
color as long as the graph sequence has uniformly bounded average degree. This
applies to many $H$-coloring examples such as the Widom-Rowlinson and
multi-state hard-core models. On the other hand, for the $q$-coloring model,
which falls outside this class, we show that consistent estimation may be
impossible even for graphs with bounded average degree. Nevertheless, we show
that the MPL estimate is $\sqrt N$-consistent in the $q$-coloring model when
$\{G_N\}_{N\geq 1}$ has bounded average double neighborhood. The presence of
hard constraints, as opposed to soft constraints, leads to new challenges, and
our proofs entail applications of the method of exchangeable pairs as well as
combinatorial arguments that employ the probabilistic method.

there has been an increased interest from the evolutionary computation
community to model bilevel problems due to its applicability in the real-world
applications for decision-making problems. In this work, a partial nested
evolutionary approach with a local heuristic search has been proposed to solve
the benchmark problems and have outstanding results. This approach relies on
the concept of intermarriage-crossover in search of feasible regions by
exploiting information from the constraints. A new variant has also been
proposed to the commonly used convergence approaches, i.e., optimistic and
pessimistic. It is called extreme optimistic approach. The experimental results
demonstrate the algorithm converges differently to known optimum solutions with
the optimistic variants. Optimistic approach also outperforms pessimistic
approach. Comparative statistical analysis of our approach with other recently
published partial to complete evolutionary approaches demonstrates very

progressive brightening of the night sky in most of the world. This process
represents a threat for the long-term sustainability of the scientific and
educational activity of ground-based astronomical observatories operating in
the optical range. Huge investments in building, scientific and technical
workforce, equipment and maintenance can be at risk if the increasing light
pollution levels hinder the capability of carrying out the top-level scientific
observations for which these key scientific infrastructures were built. In
addition, light pollution has other negative consequences, as e.g. biodiversity
endangering and the loss of the starry sky for recreational, touristic, and
cultural enjoyment. The traditional light pollution mitigation approach is
based on imposing conditions on the photometry of individual sources, but the
aggregated effects of all sources in the territory surrounding the
observatories are seldom addressed in the regulations. We propose that this
approach shall be complemented with a top-down, inmission limits strategy,
whereby clear limits are established to the admissible deterioration of the
night sky above the observatories. We describe the general form of the
indicators that can be employed to this end, and develop linear models relating
their values to the artificial emissions across the territory. This approach
can be extended to take into account for other protection needs, and it is
expected to be useful for making informed decisions on public lighting, in the

migrates complex tasks from IoT devices to edge-cloud servers can break through
the resource limitation of IoT devices, reduce the computing burden and improve
the efficiency of task processing. However, the problem of optimal offloading
decision-making is NP-hard, traditional optimization methods are difficult to
achieve results efficiently. Besides, there are still some shortcomings in
existing deep learning methods, e.g., the slow learning speed and the failure
of the original network parameters when the environment changes. To tackle
these challenges, we propose a Deep Meta Reinforcement Learning-based
offloading (DMRO) algorithm, which combines multiple parallel DNNs with
Q-learning to make fine-grained offloading decisions. By aggregating the
perceptive ability of deep learning, the decision-making ability of
reinforcement learning, and the rapid environment learning ability of
meta-learning, it is possible to quickly and flexibly obtain the optimal
offloading strategy from the IoT environment. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm achieves obvious improvement over the Deep
Q-Learning algorithm and has strong portability in making real-time offloading

generalizes a result of the author together with Gast\'on A. Garc\'ia in

we now know were unnecessary. On the way, we describe a universal way of
constructing a universal bialgebra attached to a finite dimensional vector
space together with some algebraic structure given by a family of maps
$\{f_i:V^{\otimes n_i}\to V^{\otimes m_i}\}$. The Dubois-Violette and Launer

a fundamental role on the proof.

  Stick-Breaking Process","36 pages, 11 figures",,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In mixture modeling and clustering applications, the number of components and
clusters is often not known. A stick-breaking mixture model, such as the
Dirichlet process mixture model, is an appealing construction that assumes
infinitely many components, while shrinking the weights of most of the unused
components to near zero. However, it is well-known that this shrinkage is
inadequate: even when the component distribution is correctly specified,
spurious weights appear and give an inconsistent estimate of the number of
clusters. In this article, we propose a simple solution: when breaking each
mixture weight stick into two pieces, the length of the second piece is
multiplied by a quasi-Bernoulli random variable, taking value one or a small
constant close to zero. This effectively creates a soft-truncation and further
shrinks the unused weights. Asymptotically, we show that as long as this small
constant diminishes to zero at a rate faster than $o(1/n^2)$, with $n$ the
sample size, the posterior distribution will converge to the true number of
clusters. In comparison, we rigorously explore Dirichlet process mixture models
using a concentration parameter that is either constant or rapidly diminishes
to zero -- both of which lead to inconsistency for the number of clusters. Our
proposed model is easy to implement, requiring only a small modification of a
standard Gibbs sampler for mixture models. In simulations and a data
application of clustering brain networks, our proposed method recovers the
ground-truth number of clusters, and leads to a small number of clusters.

formulated as a non-convex optimization problem to maximize the system sum-rate
while taking into account the heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS)

frequency-selectivity and spatial-selectivity in the fading of the composite
channel from the UAV to ground users. To facilitate the design, we first derive
the expression of the composite channels and propose a parametric approximation

alternating optimization algorithm is devised to handle the lower bound
optimization problem and its performance is compared with the benchmark
performance achieved by solving the upper bound problem. Simulation results
unveil the small gap between the developed bounds and the promising sum-rate

between chemical species which move by anomalous subdiffusion. Indeed, the type
of mesoscopic equation describing reaction-subdiffusion depends on subtle
assumptions about the microscopic behavior of individual molecules.
Furthermore, the correspondence between mesoscopic and microscopic models is
not well understood. In this paper, we study the subdiffusion-limited model,
which is defined by mesoscopic equations with fractional derivatives applied to
both the movement and the reaction terms. Assuming that the reaction terms are
affine functions, we show that the solution to the fractional system is the

identifies some precise microscopic conditions that dictate when this type of

the understanding that the isolated microstructure at micro- and nano-scales
gives rise to superior strength compared to that of whole tissue, and the
tissue possesses an amplified toughness relative to that of its nanoscale
constituents. Nanoscale toughening mechanisms of bone are not adequately
understood at sample dimensions that allow for isolating salient
microstructural features, because of the challenge of performing fracture
experiments on small-sized samples. We developed an in-situ three-point bend
experimental methodology that probes site-specific fracture behavior of
micron-sized specimens of hard material. Using this, we quantify crack
initiation and growth toughness of human trabecular bone with sharp fatigue
pre-cracks and blunt notches. Our findings indicate that bone with fatigue
cracks is two times tougher than that with blunt cracks. In-situ

models built for inference of source parameters have several in-built
approximations. In current precessing IMRPhenom and SEOBNR waveform models,
systems with the same spin magnitude but varying orientation of spins projected
on the orbital plane are effectively mapped to the same system (bar an overall
phase change) and the asymmetry due to precession between the $+m$ and $-m$
modes is not modelled. In this study, we investigate the validity of these
approximations by generating numerical relativity (NR) simulations of
single-spin NR systems with varying in-plane spin directions (including several
superkick configurations) and provide an estimate of the SNR at which the
effect of varying in-plane spin directions would be measurable. This is done
computing the match between these waveforms and using these match values to
estimate the distinguishability SNR. We also use NR waveforms with different
spin magnitudes to compare the measurability of spin magnitude vs. in-plane
spin direction. We find that the in-plane spin direction could be measurable at
SNRs accessible by current generation detectors, with the distinguishability
SNR of varying in-plane spins comparable to or lower than varying the in-plane
spin magnitude. We then remove the mode-asymmetry content from the waveforms
and find that, i) removing mode-asymmetry increases the SNR at which in-plane
spin direction can be measured and ii) not modelling mode-asymmetry will lead
to measurement biases. The SNRs that we see at which the in-plane spins would
be measurable and at which mode-asymmetric content impacts the measurements are
the SNRs at which precession would be measurable, and we therefore conclude
that modelling in-plane spin direction and mode-asymmetry effects is necessary
for unbiassed measurements of precession.

Project: http://kaiyuyue.com/mgd",,,,"cs.CV cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Feature distillation is an effective way to improve the performance for a
smaller student model, which has fewer parameters and lower computation cost
compared to the larger teacher model. Unfortunately, there is a common obstacle
- the gap in semantic feature structure between the intermediate features of
teacher and student. The classic scheme prefers to transform intermediate
features by adding the adaptation module, such as naive convolutional,
attention-based or more complicated one. However, this introduces two problems:
a) The adaptation module brings more parameters into training. b) The
adaptation module with random initialization or special transformation isn't
friendly for distilling a pre-trained student. In this paper, we present
Matching Guided Distillation (MGD) as an efficient and parameter-free manner to
solve these problems. The key idea of MGD is to pose matching the teacher
channels with students' as an assignment problem. We compare three solutions of
the assignment problem to reduce channels from teacher features with partial
distillation loss. The overall training takes a coordinate-descent approach
between two optimization objects - assignments update and parameters update.
Since MGD only contains normalization or pooling operations with negligible
computation cost, it is flexible to plug into network with other distillation
methods.

services is a key challenge to enable a real-time experience and sustain a high
quality of physical experience (QoPE) for the users. In this paper, a terahertz
(THz) cellular network is used to exchange rate-hungry AR content. For this
network, guaranteeing an instantaneous low peak age of information (PAoI) is
necessary to overcome the uncertainty stemming from the THz channel. In
particular, a novel economic concept, namely, the risk of ruin is proposed to
examine the probability of occurrence of rare, but extremely high PAoI that can
jeopardize the operation of the AR service. To assess the severity of these
hazards, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the PAoI is derived for
two different scheduling policies. This CDF is then used to find the
probability of maximum severity of ruin PAoI. Furthermore, to provide long term
insights about the AR content's age, the average PAoI of the overall system is
also derived. Simulation results show that an increase in the number of users
will positively impact the PAoI in both the expected and worst-case scenarios.
Meanwhile, an increase in the bandwidth reduces the average PAoI but leads to a
decline in the severity of ruin performance. The results also show that a
system with preemptive last come first served (LCFS) queues of limited size
buffers have a better ruin performance (12% increase in the probability of
guaranteeing a less severe PAoI while increasing the number of users), whereas
first come first served (FCFS) queues of limited buffers lead to a better
average PAoI performance (45% lower PAoI as we increase the bandwidth).

We present an automated pipeline for the discovery and description of the

actual conspiracies reported in the news media. We base this work on two
separate repositories of posts and news articles describing the well-known
conspiracy theory Pizzagate from 2016, and the New Jersey conspiracy Bridgegate
from 2013. We formulate a graphical generative machine learning model where
nodes represent actors/actants, and multi-edges and self-loops among nodes
capture context-specific relationships. Posts and news items are viewed as
samples of subgraphs of the hidden narrative network. The problem of
reconstructing the underlying structure is posed as a latent model estimation
problem. We automatically extract and aggregate the actants and their
relationships from the posts and articles. We capture context specific actants
and interactant relationships by developing a system of supernodes and
subnodes. We use these to construct a network, which constitutes the underlying
narrative framework. We show how the Pizzagate framework relies on the
conspiracy theorists' interpretation of ""hidden knowledge"" to link otherwise
unlinked domains of human interaction, and hypothesize that this multi-domain
focus is an important feature of conspiracy theories. While Pizzagate relies on
the alignment of multiple domains, Bridgegate remains firmly rooted in the
single domain of New Jersey politics. We hypothesize that the narrative
framework of a conspiracy theory might stabilize quickly in contrast to the
narrative framework of an actual one, which may develop more slowly as

regimes, all above the overlapping concentration of 0.02 g/ml: I) from 0.03 to
0.1 g/mol the system undergoes a liquid-to-solid like transition with a

three-dimensional (3D) packings. A newly developed discrete element method is
used to model packings of non-convex particles of varying sphericity. Our
results establish that in 3D packings the distribution of the contact forces in
the normal direction becomes increasingly heterogeneous with decreasing
particle sphericity. However, in 2D packings the contact force distribution is
independent of particle sphericity, indicating that results obtained in 2D
packings cannot be extrapolated readily to 3D packings. Radial distribution
functions (RDFs) show that the crystallinity in 3D packings decreases with
decreasing particle sphericity. We link the decreasing homogeneity of the
contact force distributions to the decreasing crystallinity of 3D packings.
These findings are complementary to the previously observed link between the
heterogeneity of the contact force distribution and a decreasing packing
crystallinity due to an increasing polydispersity of spherical particles.

platforms to attract users to place orders. E-coupons are the digital
equivalent of traditional paper coupons which provide customers with discounts
or gifts. One of the fundamental problems related is how to deliver e-coupons
with minimal cost while users' willingness to place an order is maximized. We
call this problem the coupon allocation problem. This is a non-trivial problem
since the number of regular users on a mature e-platform often reaches hundreds
of millions and the types of e-coupons to be allocated are often multiple. The
policy space is extremely large and the online allocation has to satisfy a
budget constraint. Besides, one can never observe the responses of one user
under different policies which increases the uncertainty of the policy making
process. Previous work fails to deal with these challenges. In this paper, we
decompose the coupon allocation task into two subtasks: the user intent
detection task and the allocation task. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage
solution: at the first stage (detection stage), we put forward a novel
Instantaneous Intent Detection Network (IIDN) which takes the user-coupon
features as input and predicts user real-time intents; at the second stage
(allocation stage), we model the allocation problem as a Multiple-Choice
Knapsack Problem (MCKP) and provide a computational efficient allocation method
using the intents predicted at the detection stage. We conduct extensive online
and offline experiments and the results show the superiority of our proposed
framework, which has brought great profits to the platform and continues to

difficult to address, as these variations are continuous and gradual with

recognition is to mine the intrinsic connection or structural information from
the image batches with variations. In this work, a Discriminant Residual
Analysis (DRA) method is proposed to improve the classification performance by
discovering discriminant features in related and unrelated groups.
Specifically, DRA attempts to obtain a powerful projection which casts the
residual representations into a discriminant subspace. Such a projection
subspace is expected to magnify the useful information of the input space as
much as possible, then the relation between the training set and the test set

another approach to construct the unrelated groups, which help to reduce

interpret the nature of $M_{\rm dust}$/$M_{\rm \star}$ in 300 massive
($M_{\star}>10^{10}M_{\odot}$), dusty star-forming galaxies detected with ALMA
up to $z\approx5$. We find that $M_{\rm dust}$/$M_{\rm \star}$ evolves with
redshift, stellar mass, specific SFR and integrated dust size, differently for
main sequence and starburst galaxies. In both galaxy populations $M_{\rm

towards higher redshifts. We show that the inverse relation between $M_{\rm

interpreted as an evolutionary transition from early to late starburst phases.
We demonstrate that $M_{\rm dust}$/$M_{\rm \star}$ in starbursts mirrors the
increase in molecular gas fraction with redshift, and is enhanced in objects
with the most compact dusty star-formation. The state-of-the-art cosmological
simulation SIMBA broadly matches the evolution of $M_{\rm dust}$/$M_{\rm

latter is found to be linked to lower gas-phase metallicities and longer dust
growth timescales relative to data. Our data are well reproduced by analytical
model that includes recipes for rapid metal enrichment, strongly suggesting
that high $M_{\rm dust}$/$M_{\rm \star}$ is due to fast grain growth in metal
enriched ISM. Our work highlights multifold benefits of using $M_{\rm
dust}$/$M_{\rm \star}$ as a diagnostic tool for: (1) separating main sequence

dusty galaxies, and (3) refining the treatment of dust life cycle in

$\mathcal{O}(s)$ irrespective of the KK mode numbers and helicities considered.
Because this calculation requires summing infinitely-many spin-2 mediated
diagrams which each diverge like $\mathcal{O}(s^{5})$, overall $\mathcal{O}(s)$
growth is only attained through cancellations between these diagrams. This in
turn requires intricate cancellations between infinitely-many KK mode masses
and couplings. We derive these sum rules, including their generalization to
fully inelastic processes. We also consider these matrix elements in the
five-dimensional orbifolded torus (5DOT) and large $kr_{c}$ limits, investigate
the impact of including only finitely-many diagrams in the calculation (as
measured via truncation error), and calculate the five-dimensional strong
coupling scale $\Lambda_{\pi} \equiv M_{\text{Pl}}\, e^{-kr_{c}\pi}$ via the
four-dimensional scattering calculation.

or external forcing, has attracted wide attention in several fields of science
and engineering. However, the simultaneous utilization of these coupling
schemes in quenching of LCO has rarely been studied despite its practical
applicability. We study the dynamics of two thermoacoustic oscillators
simultaneously subjected to mutual coupling and asymmetric external forcing
through experiments and theoretical modeling. We investigate the forced
response of both identical and non-identical thermoacoustic oscillators for two
different amplitudes of LCO. Under mutual coupling alone, identical
thermoacoustic oscillators display the occurrence of partial amplitude death
and amplitude death, whereas under forcing alone, asynchronous quenching of LCO
is observed at non-resonant conditions. When the oscillators are simultaneously
subjected to mutual coupling and asymmetric forcing, we observe a larger
parametric region of oscillation quenching than when the two mechanisms are
utilized individually. This enhancement in the region of oscillation quenching
is due to the complementary effect of amplitude death and asynchronous
quenching. However, a forced response of coupled non-identical oscillators
shows that the effect of forcing is insignificant on synchronization and
quenching of oscillations in the oscillator which is not directly forced.
Finally, we qualitatively capture the experimental results using a
reduced-order theoretical model of two coupled Rijke tubes which are coupled
through dissipative and time-delay coupling and asymmetrically forced. We
believe that these findings offer fresh insights into the combined effects of
mutual and forced synchronization in a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators.

representations of homogeneous graphs, leveraging GNN on heterogeneous graphs
remains a challenging problem. The dominating reason is that GNN learns node
representations by aggregating neighbors' information regardless of node types.
Some work is proposed to alleviate such issue by exploiting relations or
meta-path to sample neighbors with distinct categories, then use attention
mechanism to learn different importance for different categories. However, one
limitation is that the learned representations for different types of nodes
should own different feature spaces, while all the above work still project
node representations into one feature space. Moreover, after exploring massive
heterogeneous graphs, we identify a fact that multiple nodes with the same type
always connect to a node with another type, which reveals the many-to-one
schema, a.k.a. the hierarchical tree structure. But all the above work cannot
preserve such tree structure, since the exact multi-hop path correlation from
neighbors to the target node would be erased through aggregation. Therefore, to
overcome the limitations of the literature, we propose T-GNN, a tree
structure-aware graph neural network model for graph representation learning.
Specifically, the proposed T-GNN consists of two modules: (1) the integrated
hierarchical aggregation module and (2) the relational metric learning module.
The integrated hierarchical aggregation module aims to preserve the tree
structure by combining GNN with Gated Recurrent Unit to integrate the
hierarchical and sequential neighborhood information on the tree structure to
node representations. The relational metric learning module aims to preserve
the heterogeneity by embedding each type of nodes into a type-specific space
with distinct distribution based on similarity metrics.

$\mathbb{T}^d$ can be encoded in a form of a cube tiling code. A twin pair
$v,w$ in which $v_i=w_i'$ is glue (at the $i$th position) if the pair $v,w$ is
replaced by one word $u$ such that $u_j=v_j=w_j$ for every $j\in [d]\setminus
\{i\}$ and $u_i=*$, where $*\not\in S$ is some extra fixed symbol. A word $u$
with $u_i=*$ is cut (at the $i$th position) if $u$ is replaced by a twin pair
$q,t$ such that $q_i=t_i'$ and $u_j=q_j=t_j$ for every $j\in [d]\setminus
\{i\}$. If $V,W\subset S^d$ are two cube tiling codes and there is a sequence
of twin pairs which can be interchangeably gluing and cutting in a way which
allows us to pass from $V$ to $W$, then we say that $W$ is obtained from $V$ by
gluing and cutting. In the paper it is shown that for every two cube tiling

learning and adversarial strategy made a significant breakthrough in the
adaptability of features, there are two issues to be further studied. First,
hard-assigned pseudo labels on the target domain are arbitrary and error-prone,
and direct application of them may destroy the intrinsic data structure.
Second, batch-wise training of deep learning limits the characterization of the
global structure. In this paper, a Riemannian manifold learning framework is
proposed to achieve transferability and discriminability simultaneously. For
the first issue, this framework establishes a probabilistic discriminant
criterion on the target domain via soft labels. Based on pre-built prototypes,
this criterion is extended to a global approximation scheme for the second
issue. Manifold metric alignment is adopted to be compatible with the embedding
space. The theoretical error bounds of different alignment metrics are derived
for constructive guidance. The proposed method can be used to tackle a series
of variants of domain adaptation problems, including both vanilla and partial

and a comparative study shows the superiority of the discriminative manifold

pc of the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Centre is a mystery. Tidal
forces from the black hole would likely inhibit {\it in situ} star formation
whilst the youth of the massive stars would seem to exclude formation elsewhere
followed by transportation (somehow) into the Galactic centre. Here we consider
a third way to produce these massive stars from the lower-mass stars contained
in the nuclear stellar cluster which surrounds the supermassive black hole. A
passing gas cloud can be tidally shredded by the supermassive black hole
forming an accretion disc around the black hole. Stars embedded within this
accretion disc will accrete gas from the disc via Bondi-Hoyle accretion, where
the accretion rate onto a star, $\dot{M}_\star \propto M_\star^2$. This
super-exponential growth of accretion can lead to a steep increase in stellar
masses, reaching the required 40-50 M$_\odot$ in some cases. The mass growth
rate depends sensitively on the stellar orbital eccentricities and their
inclinations. The evolution of the orbital inclinations and/or their
eccentricities as stars are trapped by the disc, and their orbits are
circularised, will increase the number of massive stars produced. Thus
accretion onto low-mass stars can lead to a top heavy stellar mass function in
the Galactic Centre and other galactic nuclei. The massive stars produced will
pollute the environment via supernova explosions and potentially produce
compact binaries whose mergers may be detectable by the LIGO-VIRGO
gravitational waves observatories.

Auto-Encoder (AAE) shows effectiveness on tackling such data by combining

Dual Adversarial Auto-encoder (Dual-AAE) which simultaneously maximizes the
likelihood function and mutual information between observed examples and a

objective function of Dual-AAE, we derive a new reconstruction loss which can
be optimized by training a pair of Auto-encoders. Moreover, to avoid mode
collapse, we introduce the clustering regularization term for the category
variable. Experiments on four benchmarks show that Dual-AAE achieves superior
performance over state-of-the-art clustering methods. Besides, by adding a
reject option, the clustering accuracy of Dual-AAE can reach that of supervised
CNN algorithms. Dual-AAE can also be used for disentangling style and content

method is well known as an online learning technique for improving sample
efficiency in traditional reinforcement learning with linear regressors rather
than DRL. The dependency between parameters of deep neural networks would
destroy the eligibility traces, which is why they are not integrated with DRL.
Although replacing the gradient with the most influential one rather than
accumulating the gradients as the eligibility traces can alleviate this
problem, the replacing operation reduces the number of reuses of previous
experiences. To address these issues, this study proposes a new eligibility
traces method that can be used even in DRL while maintaining high sample
efficiency. When the accumulated gradients differ from those computed using the
latest parameters, the proposed method takes into account the divergence
between the past and latest parameters to adaptively decay the eligibility

microcavity are strictly determined by carriers in the metal, including the
cooling of electrons via electron-phonon coupling and excitation of propagating

in time series of graphs. We examine two related, complementary inference
tasks: the detection of anomalous graphs within a time series, and the
detection of temporally anomalous vertices. We approach these tasks via the
adaptation of statistically principled methods for joint graph inference,
specifically multiple adjacency spectral embedding (MASE). We demonstrate that
our method is effective for our inference tasks. Moreover, we assess the
performance of our method in terms of the underlying nature of detectable
anomalies. We further provide the theoretical justification for our method and
insight into its use. Applied to a large-scale commercial search engine time
series of graphs, our approaches demonstrate their applicability and identify
the anomalous vertices beyond just large degree change.

the ability of a deep CNN to detect students with a diagnosis of specific

was used by applying transfer learning. The model was trained using a data set
of 497 images of handwriting samples from students with a diagnosis of specific

  Reconstruction Attack",,,,,"cs.CV cs.CR cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Rounding confidence score is considered trivial but a simple and effective
countermeasure to stop gradient descent based image reconstruction attacks.
However, its capability in the face of more sophisticated reconstruction
attacks is an uninvestigated research area. In this paper, we prove that, the
face reconstruction attacks based on composite faces can reveal the
inefficiency of rounding policy as countermeasure. We assume that, the attacker
takes advantage of face composite parts which helps the attacker to get access
to the most important features of the face or decompose it to the independent
segments. Afterwards, decomposed segments are exploited as search parameters to
create a search path to reconstruct optimal face. Face composition parts enable
the attacker to violate the privacy of face recognition models even with a
blind search. However, we assume that, the attacker may take advantage of
random search to reconstruct the target face faster. The algorithm is started
with random composition of face parts as initial face and confidence score is
considered as fitness value. Our experiments show that, since the rounding
policy as countermeasure can't stop the random search process, current face
recognition systems are extremely vulnerable against such sophisticated
attacks. To address this problem, we successfully test Face Detection Score
Filtering (FDSF) as a countermeasure to protect the privacy of training data
against proposed attack.

machine learning, but in real neural systems, object recognition is a
complicated process which involves the interplay between two signal pathways.
One is the parvocellular pathway (P-pathway), which is slow and extracts fine
features of objects; the other is the magnocellular pathway (M-pathway), which
is fast and extracts coarse features of objects. It has been suggested that the
interplay between the two pathways endows the neural system with the capacity
of processing visual information rapidly, adaptively, and robustly. However,
the underlying computational mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study,
we build a computational model to elucidate the computational advantages
associated with the interactions between two pathways. Our model consists of
two convolution neural networks: one mimics the P-pathway, referred to as
FineNet, which is deep, has small-size kernels, and receives detailed visual
inputs; the other mimics the M-pathway, referred to as CoarseNet, which is
shallow, has large-size kernels, and receives low-pass filtered or binarized
visual inputs. The two pathways interact with each other via a Restricted
Boltzmann Machine. We find that: 1) FineNet can teach CoarseNet through
imitation and improve its performance considerably; 2) CoarseNet can improve
the noise robustness of FineNet through association; 3) the output of CoarseNet
can serve as a cognitive bias to improve the performance of FineNet. We hope
that this study will provide insight into understanding visual information
processing and inspire the development of new object recognition architectures.

states which cannot well reflect the complexity and subtlety of emotions, or
train the matching model using an impractical multi-stage pipeline. In this
paper, we study end-to-end matching between image and music based on emotions
in the continuous valence-arousal (VA) space. First, we construct a large-scale
dataset, termed Image-Music-Emotion-Matching-Net (IMEMNet), with over 140K
image-music pairs. Second, we propose cross-modal deep continuous metric
learning (CDCML) to learn a shared latent embedding space which preserves the
cross-modal similarity relationship in the continuous matching space. Finally,
we refine the embedding space by further preserving the single-modal emotion
relationship in the VA spaces of both images and music. The metric learning in
the embedding space and task regression in the label space are jointly
optimized for both cross-modal matching and single-modal VA prediction. The
extensive experiments conducted on IMEMNet demonstrate the superiority of CDCML
for emotion-based image and music matching as compared to the state-of-the-art

feature resembles many worlds interpretation. However in the parallel lives
model, the division of lives into different worlds takes place locally. The
parallel lives model is expected to be compatible with special relativity, as
the lives propagate at a speed that does not exceed the speed of light and
interact locally. On the other hand, it is open to paradoxes based on
counterfactual propositions, as it provides a realistic interpretation of
