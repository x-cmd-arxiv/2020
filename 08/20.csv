uncertainty relation (TUR) which provides a precision-cost trade-off relation
for certain out-of-equilibrium thermodynamic observables in terms of net
entropy production. We explore this relation in the context of energy transport
in a bipartite setting for three exactly solvable toy model systems (two
coupled harmonic oscillators, two coupled qubits and a hybrid coupled
oscillator-qubit system) and analyze the role played by the underlying
statistics of the transport carriers in TUR. Interestingly, for all these
models, depending on the statistics, the TUR ratio can be expressed as a sum or
a difference of an universal term which is always greater or equal to 2 and a
corresponding entropy production term. We find that the generalized version of
the TUR, originating from the universal fluctuation symmetry is always
satisfied. However, interestingly, the specialized TUR, a tighter bound, is
always satisfied for the coupled harmonic oscillator system obeying
Bose-Einstein statistics. Whereas, for both the coupled qubit, obeying
Fermi-like statistics and the hybrid qubit-oscillator system with mixed
Fermi-Bose statistics, violation of tighter bound is observed in certain
parameter regimes. We have provided conditions for such violations. We also
provide a rigorous proof following the non-equilibrium Green's function
approach that the tighter bound is always satisfied in the weak-coupling regime
for generic bipartite systems.

  Volume 125)",,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Probabilistic sentential decision diagrams are logic circuits where the
inputs of disjunctive gates are annotated by probability values. They allow for
a compact representation of joint probability mass functions defined over sets
of Boolean variables, that are also consistent with the logical constraints
defined by the circuit. The probabilities in such a model are usually learned
from a set of observations. This leads to overconfident and prior-dependent
inferences when data are scarce, unreliable or conflicting. In this work, we
develop the credal sentential decision diagrams, a generalisation of their
probabilistic counterpart that allows for replacing the local probabilities
with (so-called credal) sets of mass functions. These models induce a joint
credal set over the set of Boolean variables, that sharply assigns probability
zero to states inconsistent with the logical constraints. Three inference
algorithms are derived for these models, these allow to compute: (i) the lower
and upper probabilities of an observation for an arbitrary number of variables;
(ii) the lower and upper conditional probabilities for the state of a single
variable given an observation; (iii) whether or not all the probabilistic
sentential decision diagrams compatible with the credal specification have the
same most probable explanation of a given set of variables given an observation
of the other variables. These inferences are tractable, as all the three
algorithms, based on bottom-up traversal with local linear programming tasks on
the disjunctive gates, can be solved in polynomial time with respect to the
circuit size. For a first empirical validation, we consider a simple
application based on noisy seven-segment display images. The credal models are
observed to properly distinguish between easy and hard-to-detect instances and
outperform other generative models not able to cope with logical constraints.

account for all potential sources of bias, techniques can be developed to
identify specific types of bias in order to mitigate their impact. In this work
we analyze how the distribution of scanner manufacturers in a dataset can
contribute to the overall bias of deep learning models. We evaluate
convolutional neural networks (CNN) for both classification and segmentation

substantially impact model performance for both classification and segmentation

to the difficulty of the task. Recognition of such bias is critical to develop
robust, generalizable models that will be crucial for clinical applications in

address this issue, we propose a blur-attention module to dynamically capture

consists of a DenseBlock unit and a spatial attention unit with multi-pooling
feature fusion, which can effectively extract complex spatially varying blur

introducing the blur-attention network into a conditional generation

the 3D radiative transfer code MCFOST to reproduce the Spectral Energy
Distribution and match the interferometric observations. To match the SED , our
model requires a stellar luminosity of 2.5 Lsun, higher than any previously
determined values. Such a high value is needed to accommodate the circumstellar
extinction caused by the highly inclined disk, which has been neglected in
previous studies. While using an effective temperature of 4800 K determined
through high-resolution spectroscopy, we derive a stellar radius of 2.29 Rsun.
These revised fundamental parameters, when combined with the mass estimates
available , lead to an age of 0.5-2.0 Ma for RY Lup, in better agreement with
the age of the Lupus association than previous determinations. Our disk model
nicely reproduces the interferometric GRAVITY data and is in good agreement
with the PIONIER ones. We derive an inner rim location at 0.12~au from the
central star. This model corresponds to an inclination of the inner disk of
50deg, which is in mild tension with previous determinations of a more inclined
outer disk from SPHERE (70 deg in NIR) and ALMA(67 $\pm$5 deg) images, but
consistent with the inclination determination from the ALMA CO spectra
(55$\pm$5deg). Increasing the inclination of the inner disk to 70 deg leads to
a higher line-of-sight extinction and therefore requires a higher stellar
luminosity of 4.65 Lsun to match the observed flux levels. This luminosity
would translate to a stellar radius of 3.13~Rsun, leading to an age of 2-3~Ma,
and a stellar mass of about 2 Msun, in disagreement with the observed dynamical
mass estimate of 1.3-1.5 Msun. Critically, this high-inclination inner disk

to wear black clothes or be captured by surveillance systems in low light
illumination, in which cases the attributes of the clothing are severely

rather than relying on the clothing information, we propose to exploit
head-shoulder features to assist person Re-ID. The head-shoulder adaptive
attention network (HAA) is proposed to learn the head-shoulder feature and an
innovative ensemble method is designed to enhance the generalization of our

head-shoulder feature by assigning a larger weight if the individual insides
the image is in black clothing. Due to the lack of a suitable benchmark dataset

dataset, which contains 1274 identities in training set. Extensive evaluations
on the Black-reID, Market1501 and DukeMTMC-reID datasets show that our model
achieves the best result compared with the state-of-the-art Re-ID methods on
both Black and conventional Re-ID problems. Furthermore, our method is also
proved to be effective in dealing with person Re-ID in similar clothing. Our

carry out further reasoning internally, allowing greater abstraction and

largely follow a common pattern, approaches towards internalization do not.
Throughout the literature, various internal presheaf operators ($\surd$,

little is known about their relative expressivenes. Moreover, some of these

qualitatively superior to SMPL. First, SMPL has a huge number of parameters
resulting from its use of global blend shapes. These dense pose-corrective
offsets relate every vertex on the mesh to all the joints in the kinematic
tree, capturing spurious long-range correlations. To address this, we define
per-joint pose correctives and learn the subset of mesh vertices that are
influenced by each joint movement. This sparse formulation results in more
realistic deformations and significantly reduces the number of model parameters
to 20% of SMPL. When trained on the same data as SMPL, STAR generalizes better
despite having many fewer parameters. Second, SMPL factors pose-dependent
deformations from body shape while, in reality, people with different shapes
deform differently. Consequently, we learn shape-dependent pose-corrective
blend shapes that depend on both body pose and BMI. Third, we show that the
shape space of SMPL is not rich enough to capture the variation in the human
population. We address this by training STAR with an additional 10,000 scans of
male and female subjects, and show that this results in better model
generalization. STAR is compact, generalizes better to new bodies and is a
drop-in replacement for SMPL. STAR is publicly available for research purposes

Central Limit Theorem on periodic orbits for expansive maps with the
specification property. We extend these techniques from the uniform to the
non-uniform setting, and from discrete-time to continuous-time. We consider
H\""older observables subject only to the Lindeberg condition and a weak
positive variance condition. If we assume a natural strengthened positive
variance condition, the Lindeberg condition is always satisfied. Our results
extend to dynamical arrays of H\""older observables, and to weighted periodic
orbit measures which converge to a unique equilibrium state.

state of the vertex and its neighbors. If every configuration of vertices is
solvable, then we say that the graph is always solvable. We introduce a concept
which we call the activation numbers of vertices and we prove several
characterization results of graphs by using this concept. We show that for
every always solvable graph there exists a chain of always solvable subgraphs

characterize always solvable trees by showing that all always solvable trees
can be constructed from always solvable subtrees by some special types of

According to the system's initial state, three types of qualitatively different

states that belong to a decoherence free subspace (DFS), which maintain
invariant their entanglement and coherence throughout the evolution; ii)
\textit{exponential decay}, corresponding to initial states orthogonal to the

exponentially; iii) \textit{entanglement sudden death}, corresponding to
initial states that have some overlap with the DFS and exhibit a richer

entanglement, while the coherence decays exponentially. Our analysis offers
insights into the dynamics of entanglement in open systems of identical

focus has been solely on the satisfaction of the end-user. While user
satisfaction has, indeed, been associated with the success of the business, it
is not the only factor. In many recommendation domains, there are other
stakeholders whose needs should be taken into account in the recommendation
generation and evaluation. In this dissertation, I describe the notion of
multi-stakeholder recommendation. In particular, I study one of the most
important challenges in recommendation research, popularity bias, from a
multi-stakeholder perspective since, as I show later in this dissertation, it
impacts different stakeholders in a recommender system. Popularity bias is a
well-known phenomenon in recommender systems where popular items are
recommended even more frequently than their popularity would warrant,
amplifying long-tail effects already present in many recommendation domains.
Prior research has examined various approaches for mitigating popularity bias
and enhancing the recommendation of long-tail items overall. The effectiveness
of these approaches, however, has not been assessed in multi-stakeholder
environments. In this dissertation, I study the impact of popularity bias in
recommender systems from a multi-stakeholder perspective. In addition, I
propose several algorithms each approaching the popularity bias mitigation from
a different angle and compare their performances using several metrics with
some other state-of-the-art approaches in the literature. I show that, often,
the standard evaluation measures of popularity bias mitigation in the
literature do not reflect the real picture of an algorithm's performance when
it is evaluated from a multi-stakeholder point of view.

between helical edge states (HESs) and bound states of nonmagnetic point
defects in two-dimensional topological insulators in the general case of broken
axial spin symmetry. It is found that the coupling of HESs and a single defect
leads to the formation of composite HESs composed of the bound states and a set
of the conventional HESs. Their spectral density near the defect has a
resonance shifted relative to the energy level of the bound state. But of most
importance is a long-range perturbation of the HESs around the defect, which is
a cloud consisting of both Kramers partners of conventional edge states.
Therefore each of the composite HESs contains both the right- and left-moving
conventional HESs. The amplitude of this perturbation decreases inversely with
the distance from the defect. In a system of many defects, this perturbation
leads to a long-range coupling between bound states of different defects
mediated by the HESs and causes amazing effects. We study these effects for a
two-defect system where the proposed mechanism of indirect coupling leads to a
splitting of the resonances of isolated defects even if the distance between
them is very large. As a result an asymmetric structure of two-peak resonance
arises that very unusually changes with the distance between the defects.

two key advantages: (i) it is a polar semiconductor which allows sensitivity to
a broader range of dark matter candidates; and (ii) it exists in many stable
polymorphs with varying physical properties, and hence has tunable sensitivity
to various dark matter models. We show that SiC is an excellent target to
search for electron, nuclear and phonon excitations from scattering of dark
matter down to 10 keV in mass, as well as for absorption processes of dark
matter down to 10 meV in mass. Combined with its widespread use as an
alternative to silicon in other detector technologies and its availability
compared to diamond, our results demonstrate that SiC holds much promise as a
novel dark matter detector.

  Domain Adaptation",,,"10.1109/TIP.2021.3084750",,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we quest the capability of transferring the quality of natural
scene images to the images that are not acquired by optical cameras (e.g.,
screen content images, SCIs), rooted in the widely accepted view that the human
visual system has adapted and evolved through the perception of natural
environment. Here, we develop the first unsupervised domain adaptation based no
reference quality assessment method for SCIs, leveraging rich subjective
ratings of the natural images (NIs). In general, it is a non-trivial task to
directly transfer the quality prediction model from NIs to a new type of
content (i.e., SCIs) that holds dramatically different statistical
characteristics. Inspired by the transferability of pair-wise relationship, the
proposed quality measure operates based on the philosophy of improving the
transferability and discriminability simultaneously. In particular, we
introduce three types of losses which complementarily and explicitly regularize
the feature space of ranking in a progressive manner. Regarding feature
discriminatory capability enhancement, we propose a center based loss to
rectify the classifier and improve its prediction capability not only for
source domain (NI) but also the target domain (SCI). For feature discrepancy
minimization, the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) is imposed on the extracted
ranking features of NIs and SCIs. Furthermore, to further enhance the feature
diversity, we introduce the correlation penalization between different feature
dimensions, leading to the features with lower rank and higher diversity.
Experiments show that our method can achieve higher performance on different
source-target settings based on a light-weight convolution neural network. The
proposed method also sheds light on learning quality assessment measures for
unseen application-specific content without the cumbersome and costing
subjective evaluations.

employed to study the dynamics of the quantum spin system including
environmental effects and to evaluate the purity and the von Neumann entropy of

the production of coherence through a unitary transformation depends on whether
the system is prepared initially in mixed state. Production of coherence is
efficient when the system initially is prepared in the region of the separatrix
(i.e., the region where classical systems exhibit dynamical chaos). From the
theory of dynamical chaos, we know that phase trajectories of the system
passing through the homoclinic tangle have limited memory, and therefore the
information about the initial conditions is lost. We proved that quantum chaos
and diminishing of information about the mixed initial state favors the
generation of quantum coherence through the unitary evolution. We introduced
quantum distance from the homoclinic tangle and proved that for the initial
states permitting efficient generation of coherence, this distance is minimal.

topics and has achieved promising results boosted by the recent development of
deep learning. However, most state-of-the-art approaches tend to perform poorly
when the training and testing images are on different domains, e.g., source
domain and target domain, respectively, due to the spectral variability caused
by different acquisition conditions. Transfer learning-based methods address
this problem by pre-training in the source domain and fine-tuning on the target
domain. Nonetheless, a considerable amount of data on the target domain has to
be labeled and non-negligible computational resources are required to retrain
the whole network. In this paper, we propose a new transfer learning scheme to
bridge the gap between the source and target domains by projecting the HSI data
from the source and target domains into a shared abundance space based on their
own physical characteristics. In this way, the domain discrepancy would be
largely reduced such that the model trained on the source domain could be
applied on the target domain without extra efforts for data labeling or network
retraining. The proposed method is referred to as physically-constrained
transfer learning through shared abundance space (PCTL-SAS). Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method as
compared to the state-of-the-art. The success of this endeavor would largely
facilitate the deployment of HSI classification for real-world sensing
scenarios.

polynomial evaluation of the dataset in such a scenario in an efficient
parallel fashion while keeping the privacy of data amidst possible collusion of

that Shamir's secret sharing, as one of its main building blocks, can be
employed. Such a solution, however, is not properly scalable with the size of

we propose a novel extension of LCC to the analog domain, referred to as analog
LCC (ALCC). All the operations in the proposed ALCC protocol are done over the
infinite fields of R/C but for practical implementations floating-point numbers
are used. We characterize the privacy of data in ALCC, against any subset of
colluding workers up to a certain size, in terms of the distinguishing security

measured using the luminosity in different frequency bands, often under the
assumption of a time-steady SFR in the recent past. We use star formation
histories (SFHs) extracted from cosmological simulations of star-forming
galaxies from the FIRE project to analyze the time-scales to which the
H${\alpha}$ and far-ultraviolet (FUV) continuum SFR indicators are sensitive.
In these simulations, the SFRs are highly time variable for all galaxies at
high redshift, and continue to be bursty to z=0 in dwarf galaxies. When FIRE
SFHs are partitioned into their bursty and time-steady phases, the best-fitting
FUV time-scale fluctuates from its ~10 Myr value when the SFR is time-steady to
>~100 Myr immediately following particularly extreme bursts of star formation
during the bursty phase. On the other hand, the best-fitting averaging
time-scale for H${\alpha}$ is generally insensitive to the SFR variability in
the FIRE simulations and remains ~5 Myr at all times. These time-scales are
shorter than the 100 Myr and 10 Myr time-scales sometimes assumed in the
literature for FUV and H${\alpha}$, respectively, because while the FUV
emission persists for stellar populations older than 100 Myr, the
time-dependent luminosities are strongly dominated by younger stars. Our
results confirm that the ratio of SFRs inferred using H${\alpha}$ vs. FUV can
be used to probe the burstiness of star formation in galaxies.

\textit{local light cone}, and to the time of the quench via a global
\textit{quench light cone}. We determine the initial-slip exponent that governs
the short-time dependence of two-point functions. We highlight the new
qualitative features of aging due to the long-range coupling, in particular in
the region outside the light cones. As an important consequence of long-range
coupling, the correlation function decays as $1/x^{d+\sigma}$ outside the
quench light cone while increasing polynomially with the total time after
quench. This is while, for short time differences, the two-time response
function ""equilibrates"" at \textit{all} distances even outside this light cone.
Our analytic findings are in excellent agreement with exact numerics, and
provide a useful benchmark for modern experimental platforms with long-range
interactions.

Bose-Hubbard models. We focus on two models where the aperiodic component is
present in different parts of the problem. First, we consider a 2D
generalisation of the Aubry-Andr\'e model, where the lattice geometry is that
of a square with a quasiperiodic onsite potential. Second, we consider the
randomly disordered vertex model, which takes aperiodic tilings with
non-crystalline rotational symmetries, and forms lattices from the vertices and
lengths of the tiles. For the disordered vertex models, the mean-field Bose
glass forms across large ranges of the chemical potential, and we observe no
significant differences from the case of a square lattice with uniform random
disorder. Small variations in the critical points in the presence of random
disorder between quasicrystalline and crystalline lattice geometries can be
accounted for by the varying coordination number and the different rotational
symmetries present. In the 2D Aubry-Andr\'e model, substantial differences are
observed from the usual phase diagrams of crystalline disordered systems. We
show that weak modulation lines can be predicted from the underlying potential
and may stabilise or suppress the mean-field Bose glass in certain regimes.
This results in a lobe-like structure for the mean-field Bose glass in the 2D
Aubry-Andr\'e model, which is significantly different from the case of random
disorder. Together, the two quasicrystalline models studied in this work show
that the mean-field Bose glass phase is present, as expected for 2D
quasiperiodic models. However, a quasicrystalline geometry is not sufficient to
result in differences from crystalline realisations of the Bose glass, whereas
a quasiperiodic form of disorder can result in different physics, as we observe
in the 2D Aubry-Andr\'e model.

intriguing population of sub-Neptunes with highly tilted and even polar orbits
relative to their host star's equator. Any viable theory for the origin of
these close-in, polar planets must explain (1) the observed stellar
obliquities, (2) the substantial eccentricities, and (3) the existence of
Jovian companions with large mutual inclinations. In this work, we propose a
theoretical model that satisfies these requirements without invoking tidal
dissipation or large primordial inclinations. Instead, tilting is facilitated
by the protoplanetary disk dispersal during the late stage of planet formation,
initiating a process of resonance sweeping and parametric instability. This
mechanism consists of two steps. First, a nodal secular resonance excites the
inclination to large values; then, once the inclination reaches a critical
value, a linear eccentric instability is triggered, which detunes the resonance
and ends inclination growth. The critical inclination is pushed to high values
by general relativistic precession, making polar orbits an inherently
post-Newtonian outcome. Our model predicts that polar, close-in sub-Neptunes
coexist with cold Jupiters in low stellar obliquity orbits.

trigger a detonation within the core (the double-detonation model, DDM). The
outcome of this explosion is similar to a central ignition of a

observational properties of SNe Ia, several computational challenges prohibit a
robust comparison to the observations. We focus on the observed
$t_0-M_\text{Ni56}$ relation, where $t_0$ (the $\gamma$-rays' escape time from

$^{56}$Ni mass). We apply our recently developed numerical scheme to calculate

exchange mass with a companion during their lives. In particular, the
progenitors of a large fraction of compact object mergers, and Galactic neutron
stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs) have been stripped off their envelopes by a
binary companion. Here, we study the evolution of single and stripped binary
stars up to core collapse with the stellar evolution code MESA and their final
fates with a parametric supernova (SN) model. We find that stripped binary
stars can have systematically different pre-SN structures compared to genuine
single stars and thus also different SN outcomes. The bases of these
differences are already established by the end of core helium burning and are
preserved up to core collapse. We find a non-monotonic pattern of NS and BH
formation as a function of CO core mass that is different in single and
stripped binary stars. In terms of initial masses, single stars of >35 Msun all
form BHs, while this transition is only at 70 Msun in stripped stars. On
average, stripped stars give rise to lower NS and BH masses, higher explosion
energies, higher kick velocities and higher nickel yields. Within a simplified
population synthesis model, we show that our results lead to a significant
reduction of the rates of BH-NS and BH-BH mergers with respect to typical
assumptions made on NS and BH formation. Therefore, we predict lower detection
rates of such merger events by, e.g., advanced LIGO than is often considered.
We further show how features in the NS-BH mass distribution of single and
stripped stars relate to the chirp-mass distribution of compact object mergers.
Further implications of our findings are discussed with respect to the missing
red-supergiant problem, a possible mass gap between NSs and BHs, X-ray binaries
and observationally inferred nickel masses from Type Ib/c and IIP Sne.

$H$ and decreases with $c$ for both DWs, but their characteristics differ

of magneto-electric DW by perturbation theory. Another finding is a splitting

small. Internal structure of composite DW deforms with increasing $c$ and $H$,

interplay between their feedback, inflowing gas and stellar dynamics, which
often includes close stellar encounters. Hydrodynamical simulations usually
resort to substantial simplifications to model embedded clusters. Here, we
address the simplification which approximates the whole star cluster by a
single sink particle, which completely neglects the internal stellar dynamics.
In order to model the internal stellar dynamics, we implement a Hermite
predictor-corrector integration scheme to the hydrodynamic code FLASH. As we
illustrate by a suite of tests, this integrator significantly outperforms the
current leap-frog scheme, and it is able to follow the dynamics of small
compact stellar systems without the necessity to soften the gravitational
potential. We find that resolving individual massive stars instead of
representing the whole cluster by a single energetic source has a profound
influence on the gas component: for clusters of mass less than $\lesssim 3
\times 10^3 M_{\odot}$, it slows gas expulsion by a factor of $\approx 5$ to
$\approx 1$ Myr, and it results in substantially more complex gas structures.
With increasing cluster mass (up to $\approx 3\times 10^3 M_{\odot}$), the gas
expulsion time-scale slightly decreases. However, more massive clusters
($\gtrsim 5\times 10^3 M_{\odot}$) are unable to clear their natal gas with
photoionising radiation and stellar winds only if they form with a star
formation efficiency (SFE) of $1/3$. This implies that the more massive
clusters are either cleared with another feedback mechanism or they form with a
SFE higher than $1/3$.

of more than 50,000 haloes within the halo mass range $11 < \log_{10} ({\rm

magnitude of both effects depends strongly on the total gas and virial mass of
the haloes, and that the integrated kSZ signal displays a significant
correlation with the angular momentum of the intra-halo gas, particularly for
massive haloes. Second, we show that both the integrated kSZ signal and the
ratio of the integrated kSZ and tSZ signals trace total halo spin, even though
significant scatter exists. Finally, we demonstrate that, in the absence of
observational and instrumental uncertainties, these SZ-related statistics can
be used to recover most of the underlying IllustrisTNG halo spin bias signal.

$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ and uncover a striking dependence of the magnetic coupling
constants on strain effects. Different magnetic interactions are found to
respond very unequally to variations in the lattice, with the Kitaev
interaction being the most sensitive. Exact diagonalization results on our
magnetoelastic model reproduce recent measurements of the structural
Gr\""uneisen parameter and explain the origin of the negative magnetostriction
of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, disentangling contributions related to different
anisotropic interactions and g factors. Uniaxial strain perpendicular to the
honeycomb planes is predicted to reorganize the relative coupling strengths,
strongly enhancing the Kitaev interaction while simultaneously weakening the
other anisotropic exchanges under compression. Uniaxial strain may therefore
pose a fruitful route to experimentally tune $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ nearer to the
Kitaev limit.

  Time Series Forecasting",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multivariate time series forecasting, which analyzes historical time series
to predict future trends, can effectively help decision-making. Complex
relations among variables in MTS, including static, dynamic, predictable, and
latent relations, have made it possible to mining more features of MTS.
Modeling complex relations are not only essential in characterizing latent
dependency as well as modeling temporal dependence but also brings great
challenges in the MTS forecasting task. However, existing methods mainly focus
on modeling certain relations among MTS variables. In this paper, we propose a
novel end-to-end deep learning model, termed Multivariate Time Series
Forecasting via Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (MTHetGNN). To characterize
complex relations among variables, a relation embedding module is designed in
MTHetGNN, where each variable is regarded as a graph node, and each type of
edge represents a specific static or dynamic relationship. Meanwhile, a
temporal embedding module is introduced for time series features extraction,
where involving convolutional neural network (CNN) filters with different
perception scales. Finally, a heterogeneous graph embedding module is adopted
to handle the complex structural information generated by the two modules.
Three benchmark datasets from the real world are used to evaluate the proposed
MTHetGNN. The comprehensive experiments show that MTHetGNN achieves
state-of-the-art results in the MTS forecasting task.

Specifically, we analyze the competition between two different dissipation
channels arising from two incompatible continuous monitoring protocols. The
first protocol locks the phase of neighboring sites upon registering a quantum
jump, thereby generating a long-range entanglement through the system, while
the second destroys the coherence via a dephasing mechanism. By studying the
unraveling of stochastic quantum trajectories associated with the continuous

volume fluctuations. Monte Carlo methods for generating samplings of particles
consistent with local charge conservation are presented, and are followed by a
review of simple analytic models involving a single type of charge with a

superimposed onto a simple parameterization of collective flow, known as a

The spatial extent of local charge conservation is parameterized by the size

This is due to the unique amenability of the unanesthetized fetal sheep to the

repetitive blood sampling, substance injection, recording of bioelectrical
activity, application of electric stimulation and in vivo organ imaging.
Recently, there has been growing interest in pleiotropic effects of vagus nerve
stimulation (VNS) on various organ systems such as innate immunity, metabolism,
and appetite control. There is no approach to study this in utero and
corresponding physiological understanding is scarce. New Method: Based on our
previous presentation of a stable chronically instrumented unanesthetized fetal
sheep model, here we describe the surgical instrumentation procedure allowing
successful implantation of a cervical uni- or bilateral VNS probe with or
without vagotomy. Results: In a cohort of 53 animals, we present the changes in
blood gas, metabolic, and inflammatory markers during the postoperative period.
We detail the design of a VNS probe which also allows recording from the nerve.
We also present an example of vagus electroneurogram (VENG) recorded from the

Methods: This method represents the first implementation of VENG/VNS in a large

dust continuum emission to the mass, but their values have long been uncertain,
especially in disks around young stellar objects. We propose a method to
constrain the opacity $\kappa_\nu$ in edge-on disks from a characteristic
optical depth $\tau_{0,\nu}$, the density $\rho_0$ and radius $R_0$ at the disk
outer edge through $\kappa_\nu=\tau_{0,\nu}/(\rho_0 R_0)$ where $\tau_{0,\nu}$
is inferred from the shape of the observed flux along the major axis, $\rho_0$
from gravitational stability considerations, and $R_0$ from direct imaging. We
applied the 1D semi-analytical model to the embedded, Class 0, HH 212 disk,
which has high-resolution data in ALMA Band 9, 7, 6, and 3 and VLA Ka band
($\lambda$=0.43, 0.85, 1.3, 2.9, and 9.1 mm). The modeling of the HH 212 disk
is extended to 2D through RADMC-3D radiative transfer calculations. We find a
dust opacity of $\kappa_\nu \approx $ $1.9\times 10^{-2}$, $1.3\times 10^{-2}$,
and $4.9\times 10^{-3}$ cm$^2$ per gram of gas and dust for ALMA Bands 7, 6,

The inferred opacities lend support to the widely used prescription
$\kappa_\lambda=2.3\times 10^{-2} (1.3 {\rm mm}/\lambda)$ cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$
advocated by Beckwith et al. (1990). We inferred a temperature of ~45K at the
disk outer edge which increases radially inward. It is well above the
sublimation temperatures of ices such as CO and N$_2$, which supports the
notion that the disk chemistry cannot be completely inherited from the
protostellar envelope.

repeated quantum nondemolition (QND) readout of binary observables such as
quantum bits (qubits). A commonly used figure of merit for readout performance
is the error rate for binary assignment in a single repetition. However, it is
known that this figure of merit is insufficient. Indeed, real-world readout
outcomes are typically analog instead of binary. Binary assignment therefore
discards important information on the level of confidence in the analog
outcomes. Here, a generalized figure of merit that fully captures the
information contained in the analog readout outcomes is suggested. This figure
of merit is the Chernoff information associated with the statistics of the
analog readout outcomes in one repetition. Unlike the single-repetition error
rate, the Chernoff information uniquely determines the asymptotic cumulative
error rate for arbitrary readout noise. As a result, non-Gaussian readout noise
common in experiments can be described by effective Gaussian noise with the
same Chernoff information. Importantly, it is shown that such a universal
description persists for the small number of repetitions and non-QND
imperfections relevant to real experiments. Finally, the Chernoff information
is used to rigorously quantify the amount of information discarded by
analog-to-binary conversion. These results provide a unified framework for
qubit readout and should facilitate optimization and engineering of near-term

networks along with scalable optimization algorithms. One key technical
challenge for directly applying maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) to censored
data is that evaluating the objective function and its gradients with respect
to model parameters requires the calculation of integrals. To address this
challenge, we recognize that the MLE for censored data can be viewed as a
differential-equation constrained optimization problem, a novel perspective.
Following this connection, we model the distribution of event time through an
ordinary differential equation and utilize efficient ODE solvers and adjoint
sensitivity analysis to numerically evaluate the likelihood and the gradients.
Using this approach, we are able to 1) provide a broad family of
continuous-time survival distributions without strong structural assumptions,
2) obtain powerful feature representations using neural networks, and 3) allow
efficient estimation of the model in large-scale applications using stochastic
gradient descent. Through both simulation studies and real-world data examples,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison to

study throttling in the context of directed graphs (digraphs). We characterize
all simple digraphs with throttling number at most $t$ and examine the change

introduce the orientation throttling interval (OTI) of an undirected graph,
which is the range of throttling numbers achieved by the orientations of the

  However, GOP based scoring models have two major limitations: i.e., (i) They
depend on forced alignment which splits the speech into phonetic segments and
independently use them for scoring, which neglects the transitions between
phonemes within the segment;
  (ii) They only focus on phonetic segments, which fails to consider the
context effects across phonemes (such as liaison, omission, incomplete plosive
sound, etc.).
  In this work, we propose the Context-aware Goodness of Pronunciation (CaGOP)
scoring model. Particularly, two factors namely the transition factor and the
duration factor are injected into CaGOP scoring.
  The transition factor identifies the transitions between phonemes and applies
them to weight the frame-wise GOP. Moreover, a self-attention based phonetic
duration modeling is proposed to introduce the duration factor into the scoring
model.
  The proposed scoring model significantly outperforms baselines, achieving 20%

When the important assumption of A/B testing, the Stable Unit Treatment Value
Assumption (SUTVA), which states that each individual's response is affected by
their own treatment only, is not valid, the classical estimate of the ATE
usually leads to a wrong conclusion. In this paper, we propose a

cluster-adaptive randomization is employed to minimize the cluster-level
Mahalanobis distance within the two treatment groups, so that the variance of

estimator is used to eliminate the bias caused by network interference,
resulting in a consistent estimation for the ATE. Numerical studies suggest our

  Method: After brainstorming with 7 DevOps experts to better formulate our
research and procedures, we collected and analyzed data from 37 semi-structured

  Results: After a careful analysis, we identified four common organizational
structures: (1) siloed departments, (2) classical DevOps, (3) cross-functional

transitioning between these structures.
  Conclusion: The main contribution of this study is a theory in the form of a

neurons downstream from the input stimuli. The biological reason for the
occurrence of expanded structure in the brain is unclear, but may be because
expansion can increase the expressive power of a neural network. In this work,
we show that expanding a neural network can improve its generalization
performance even in cases in which the expanded structure is pruned after the
learning period. To study this setting we use a teacher-student framework where
a perceptron teacher network generates labels which are corrupted with small
amounts of noise. We then train a student network that is structurally matched
to the teacher and can achieve optimal accuracy if given the teacher's synaptic
weights. We find that sparse expansion of the input of a student perceptron
network both increases its capacity and improves the generalization performance
of the network when learning a noisy rule from a teacher perceptron when these
expansions are pruned after learning. We find similar behavior when the
expanded units are stochastic and uncorrelated with the input and analyze this
network in the mean field limit. We show by solving the mean field equations
that the generalization error of the stochastic expanded student network
continues to drop as the size of the network increases. The improvement in
generalization performance occurs despite the increased complexity of the
student network relative to the teacher it is trying to learn. We show that
this effect is closely related to the addition of slack variables in artificial
neural networks and suggest possible implications for artificial and biological
neural networks.

software components, and depend on hundreds of configurations parameters to
function correctly, securely, and with high performance. Due to the prevalence
of open-source software, developers can easily deploy services using
third-party software without mastering the configurations of that software. As
a result, configuration errors (i.e., misconfigurations) are among the leading
causes of service disruptions and outages. While existing cloud automation
tools ease the process of service deployment and management, support for
detecting misconfigurations in the cloud has not been addressed thoroughly,
likely due to the lack of frameworks suitable for consistent parsing of
unstandardized configuration files. This paper introduces ConfEx, a framework
that enables discovery and extraction of text-based software configurations in
the cloud. ConfEx uses a novel vocabulary-based technique to identify
configuration files in cloud system instances with unlabeled content. To
extract the information in these files, ConfEx leverages existing configuration
parsers and post-processes the extracted data for analysis. We show that ConfEx
achieves over 99% precision and 100% recall in identifying configuration files
on 7805 popular Docker Hub images. Using two applied examples, we demonstrate
that ConfEx also enables detecting misconfigurations in the cloud via existing
tools that are designed for configurations represented as key-value pairs,
revealing 184 errors in public Docker Hub images.

in the presence of an ultrastrong magnetic field, and is shown to bear a
remarkable resemblance to the rising hard X-ray spectra of quiescent magnetars.
This emission is powered by pair annihilation which, in contrast with a weakly
magnetized pair plasma, shows an extended low-frequency tail similar to
bremsstrahlung. Cross sections for electron-positron annihilation/scattering,
two-photon pair creation, and photon-$e^\pm$ scattering are adopted from our
earlier ab initio QED calculations in the regime $10\alpha_{\rm em}^{-1}B_{\rm
Q} \gg B \gg B_{\rm Q}$. Careful attention is given to the $u$-channel
scattering resonance. Magnetospheric arcades anchored in zones of intense
crustal shear and extending to about twice the magnetar radius are identified
as the sites of the persistent hard X-ray emission. We deduce a novel and
stable configuration for the magnetospheric circuit, with a high plasma density
sustained by ohmic heating and in situ pair creation. Pairs are sourced
non-locally by photon collisions in zones with weak currents, such as the polar
cap. Annihilation bremsstrahlung extends to the optical-IR band, where the
plasma cutoff is located. The upper magnetar atmosphere experiences strong
current-driven growth of ion-acoustic turbulence, which may limit positron
diffusion. Coherent optical-IR emission is bounded near the observed flux by
induced scattering. This model accommodates the rapid X-ray brightening of an
activating magnetar, concentrated thermal hotspots, and the subdominant thermal
X-ray emission of some active magnetars. Current injection is ascribed to
continuous magnetic braiding, as seen in the global yielding calculations of
Thompson, Yang & Ortiz.

long-range coherent textures that carry spin currents known as dissipative

DEFs decay algebraically and extend through the length of the channel, a regime
known as spin superfluidity. Similar to fluids, these structures are prone to
phase-slips that manifest as vortex-antivortex pairs. Here, we numerically
study vortex shedding from DEFs excited in a magnetic nanowire with a physical
obstacle. Using micromagnetic simulations, we find regimes of laminar flow and
vortex shedding as a function of obstacle position tunable by the and spin
injection sign and magnitude. Vortex-antivortex pairs translate forward (VF
regime) or backward (VB regime) with respect to the detector's extremum,
resulting in well-defined spectral features. Qualitatively similar results are
obtained when temperature, anisotropy, and weak non-local dipole fields are
included in the simulations. These results provide clear features associated
with DEFs that may be detected experimentally in devices with nominally
identical boundary conditions. Furthermore, our results suggest that obstacles
can be considered as DEF control gates, opening an avenue to manipulate DEFs
via physical defects.

enclaves which are patches of stationary racial composition. Empirical PDFs of
patch areas and population counts in 41 US cities were analyzed to reveal that
these variables have distributions which are either power laws or approximate
power laws. Power law holds for a pool of all patches, for patches from
individual cities, and patches restricted to specific racial types. The average
value of the exponent is 1.64/1.68 for area/population in 1990 and 1.70/1.74 in

had decreased from 1990 to 2010. We have also performed a multifractal analysis

monofractal with average values of fractal dimensions in the 0.94-1.81 range

quantitative mathematical methods based on thermodynamic scaling and
hydropathic modular averaging. Our most surprising result is the identification

supported by ab initio calculations of the structure of NADH and NMNH in

internal molecular electric field in the nicotinamide ring on non-radiative

distributions that lead to the decay time heterogeneity. A slight but

slowing due to the decrease of solution polarity. The analysis of the
rotational diffusion time tau_r as a function of methanol concentration on the

U(1)_R-violating amplitudes such as for one dilaton and four gravitons. At each

integrals over moduli space of genus-two modular graph functions, generalizing
those already encountered for four external massless states. To leading and

(typically measured by KPIs) to prevent undesired process activities by raising
alarms or recommending actions. However, none of these approaches recommends
actual process activities as actions that are optimised according to a given
KPI. We present a PrBPM technique that transforms the next most likely
activities into the next best actions regarding a given KPI. Thereby, our
technique uses business process simulation to ensure the control-flow
conformance of the recommended actions. Based on our evaluation with two

outperform next activity predictions regarding the optimisation of a KPI and
the distance from the actual process instances.

developing brain but is not suitable for second-trimester anomaly screening,
for which ultrasound (US) is employed. Although expert sonographers are adept
at reading US images, MR images which closely resemble anatomical images are
much easier for non-experts to interpret. Thus in this paper we propose to
generate MR-like images directly from clinical US images. In medical image
analysis such a capability is potentially useful as well, for instance for
automatic US-MRI registration and fusion. The proposed model is end-to-end
trainable and self-supervised without any external annotations. Specifically,
based on an assumption that the US and MRI data share a similar anatomical
latent space, we first utilise a network to extract the shared latent features,
which are then used for MRI synthesis. Since paired data is unavailable for our
study (and rare in practice), pixel-level constraints are infeasible to apply.
We instead propose to enforce the distributions to be statistically
indistinguishable, by adversarial learning in both the image domain and feature
space. To regularise the anatomical structures between US and MRI during
synthesis, we further propose an adversarial structural constraint. A new
cross-modal attention technique is proposed to utilise non-local spatial
information, by encouraging multi-modal knowledge fusion and propagation. We
extend the approach to consider the case where 3D auxiliary information (e.g.,
3D neighbours and a 3D location index) from volumetric data is also available,
and show that this improves image synthesis. The proposed approach is evaluated
quantitatively and qualitatively with comparison to real fetal MR images and
other approaches to synthesis, demonstrating its feasibility of synthesising
realistic MR images.

two-scalar model can couple to the Standard Model Higgs field to realize a
maximum multiplicity of criticality for field values around the electroweak

two-orders-of-magnitude improved sensitivity and allowed to resolution of three
additional contributions to noise in addition to 1/f noise. We have observed
shot noise with Fano factor close to unity. We have also observed a peculiar
generation-recombination term, which presents only under light illumination
with energy above 2 eV and thus reflects light absorption and carrier trapping
in the a-Si:H layers. A second, low-frequency generation-recombination term was
detected at temperatures below 100 K. We argue that it appears because the
process of charge carrier transfer across i-a-Si:H occurs via an intermediate
defect limited by tunneling above about 100 K and a thermally assisted process
below this temperature. We also discuss the spatial selectivity of noise
spectroscopy, namely the tendency of the method to amplify noise contributions

becomes important. A naive projection of the Fourier-space RSD model to
spherical harmonic space leads to diverging expressions. In this paper we
present a general formalism of projecting the higher-order RSD terms into

fingers-of-God (FoG), can be entirely attributed to a modification of the
radial window function. We find that while linear RSD enhances the
harmonic-space power spectrum, unlike the three-dimensional case, the
enhancement decreases on small angular-scales. The fingers-of-God suppress the
angular power spectrum on all transverse scales if the bin size is smaller than
$\Delta r \lesssim \pi \sigma_u$; for example, the radial bin sizes
corresponding to a spectral resolution $R=\lambda/\Delta \lambda$ of a few

interest. They are fabricated by forming a lattice of pores in graphene.
Depending on the pore size and pore lattice constant, GNMs can be either
semimetallic or semiconducting with a gap large enough (0.5 eV) to be
considered for transistor applications. The fabrication process is bound to
produce some structural disorder due to variations in pore sizes. Recent
electronic transport measurements in GNM devices (ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces
10, 10362, 2018) show a degradation of their bandgap in devices having
pore-size disorder. It is therefore important to understand the effect of such
variability on the electronic properties of semiconducting GNMs. In this work
we use the density functional-based tight binding formalism to calculate the
electronic properties of GNM structures with different pore sizes, pore
densities, and with hydrogen and oxygen pore edge passivations. We find that
structural disorder reduces the electronic gap and the carrier group velocity,
which may interpret recent transport measurements in GNM devices. Furthermore
the trend of the bandgap with structural disorder is not significantly affected
by the change in pore edge passivation. Our results show that even with
structural disorder, GNMs are still attractive from a transistor device
perspective.

the projectile coefficient of restitution and penetration depth, as well as
ejecta production, speed, and mass estimation. We find that impact outcomes
include the frequent occurrence of projectile bouncing and tangential rolling

than about 12 cm/s, and ejecta speeds scale with the projectile to target the
grain size ratio and the impact speed. Ejected mass estimations indicate that
ejecta is increasingly difficult to produce for increasing grain sizes.
Coefficients of restitution of rebounding projectiles do not display a

noisy random quantum circuits is linear cross-entropy benchmarking. For a
quantum circuit $C$ on $n$ qubits and a sample $z \in \{0,1\}^n$, the benchmark
involves computing $|\langle z|C|0^n \rangle|^2$, i.e. the probability of
measuring $z$ from the output distribution of $C$ on the all zeros input. Under
a strong conjecture about the classical hardness of estimating output
probabilities of quantum circuits, no polynomial-time classical algorithm given
$C$ can output a string $z$ such that $|\langle z|C|0^n\rangle|^2$ is
substantially larger than $\frac{1}{2^n}$ (Aaronson and Gunn, 2019). On the

distribution of $C$ achieves $|\langle z|C|0^n\rangle|^2 \approx \frac{2}{2^n}$
on average (Arute et al., 2019).
  In analogy with the Tsirelson inequality from quantum nonlocal correlations,
we ask: can a polynomial-time quantum algorithm do substantially better than
$\frac{2}{2^n}$? We study this question in the query (or black box) model,
where the quantum algorithm is given oracle access to $C$. We show that, for
any $\varepsilon \ge \frac{1}{\mathrm{poly}(n)}$, outputting a sample $z$ such
that $|\langle z|C|0^n\rangle|^2 \ge \frac{2 + \varepsilon}{2^n}$ on average
requires at least $\Omega\left(\frac{2^{n/4}}{\mathrm{poly}(n)}\right)$ queries
to $C$, but not more than $O\left(2^{n/3}\right)$ queries to $C$, if $C$ is
either a Haar-random $n$-qubit unitary, or a canonical state preparation oracle
for a Haar-random $n$-qubit state. We also show that when $C$ samples from the
Fourier distribution of a random Boolean function, the naive algorithm that
samples from $C$ is the optimal 1-query algorithm for maximizing $|\langle

PPI are functionally annotated in the IntAct database. Here, we aim to label
the function type of PPIs by extracting relationships described in PubMed
abstracts.
  Method: We create a weakly supervised dataset from the IntAct PPI database
containing interacting protein pairs with annotated function and associated
abstracts from the PubMed database. We apply a state-of-the-art deep learning
technique for biomedical natural language processing tasks, BioBERT, to build a
model - dubbed PPI-BioBERT - for identifying the function of PPIs. In order to
extract high quality PPI functions at large scale, we use an ensemble of
PPI-BioBERT models to improve uncertainty estimation and apply an interaction
type-specific threshold to counteract the effects of variations in the number
of training samples per interaction type.
  Results: We scan 18 million PubMed abstracts to automatically identify 3253

overall precision of 46% (87% for acetylation) based on a human-reviewed
sample. This work demonstrates that analysis of biomedical abstracts for PPI
function extraction is a feasible approach to substantially increasing the

iPhantom, for automated creation of patient-specific phantoms or digital-twins
(DT) using patient medical images. The framework is applied to assess radiation
dose to radiosensitive organs in CT imaging of individual patients. Method:
From patient CT images, iPhantom segments selected anchor organs (e.g. liver,
bones, pancreas) using a learning-based model developed for multi-organ CT
segmentation. Organs challenging to segment (e.g. intestines) are incorporated
from a matched phantom template, using a diffeomorphic registration model
developed for multi-organ phantom-voxels. The resulting full-patient phantoms
are used to assess organ doses during routine CT exams. Result: iPhantom was
validated on both the XCAT (n=50) and an independent clinical (n=10) dataset
with similar accuracy. iPhantom precisely predicted all organ locations with
good accuracy of Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) >0.6 for anchor organs and
DSC of 0.3-0.9 for all other organs. iPhantom showed less than 10% dose errors
for the majority of organs, which was notably superior to the state-of-the-art
baseline method (20-35% dose errors). Conclusion: iPhantom enables automated
and accurate creation of patient-specific phantoms and, for the first time,
provides sufficient and automated patient-specific dose estimates for CT
dosimetry. Significance: The new framework brings the creation and application
of CHPs to the level of individual CHPs through automation, achieving a wider
and precise organ localization, paving the way for clinical monitoring, and
personalized optimization, and large-scale research.

this issue, this paper presents a 3D GPR migration and dielectric prediction
system to detect and reconstruct underground targets. This system is composed
of three modules: 1) visual inertial fusion (VIF) module to generate the pose
information of GPR device, 2) deep neural network module (i.e., DepthNet) which
detects B-scan of GPR image, extracts hyperbola features to remove the noise in
B-scan data and predicts dielectric to determine the depth of the objects, 3)
3D GPR migration module which synchronizes the pose information with GPR scan
data processed by DepthNet to reconstruct and visualize the 3D underground
targets. Our proposed DepthNet processes the GPR data by removing the noise in
B-scan image as well as predicting depth of subsurface objects. For DepthNet
model training and testing, we collect the real GPR data in the concrete test
pit at Geophysical Survey System Inc. (GSSI) and create the synthetic GPR data
by using gprMax3.0 simulator. The dataset we create includes 350 labeled GPR
images. The DepthNet achieves an average accuracy of 92.64% for B-scan feature
detection and an 0.112 average error for underground target depth prediction.
In addition, the experimental results verify that our proposed method improve
the migration accuracy and performance in generating 3D GPR image compared with
the traditional migration methods.

processes can lead to unconventional thermoelectric transport. The source (or
the drain) can be cooled by passing a thermal current between the two heat
baths, with no net heat exchange between the heat baths and the electrodes.
This effect, termed as cooling by heat current, is a mesoscopic heat drag
effect. In addition, there is a transverse thermoelectric effect where
electrical current and power can be generated by a transverse temperature bias
(i.e., the temperature bias between the two heat baths). This transverse
thermoelectric effect, originates from inelastic scattering processes, may have
advantages for improved figures of merit and power factor due to spatial
separation of charge and heat transport. We study the Onsager current-affinity
relations, the linear-response transport properties, and the transverse
thermoelectric figure of merit of the four-terminal thermoelectric devices for
various system parameters. In addition, we investigate the efficiency and power
of the cooling by transverse current effect in both linear and nonlinear

transport in the quantum-dot four-terminal systems, a type of Maxwell's demon

They exhibit diverse spin state orderings and transitions between them. We
present an exact mapping from an elastic lattice mismatch model to a long-range
Ising model, with an inverse square decay of the interaction strengths at large
distances (on the square lattice). This provides a microscopic justification
for an Ising model description, which has previously only been justified on
phenomenological grounds. Elastic frustration is required for non-zero Ising
interactions, but whether or not the short-range interactions in the Ising
model are geometrically frustrated depends on the ratio of the bulk and shear
moduli or equivalently Poisson's ratio. We show that, for a simple square
lattice model with realistic parameters, sweeping the enthalpy difference
between the two spin-states at zero temperature leads to a large (probably
infinite) number of spin-state orderings and corresponding steps in the
fraction of high-spin ions, consistent with a Devil's staircase. The staircase
can also be climbed by varying the temperature, but then some of the steps are
hidden and only a finite number remain, consistent with experiments on relevant

problem that can be solved via sketching. Industrially-deployed sketches like
HyperLogLog, MinHash, and PCSA are mergeable, which means that large data sets
can be sketched in a distributed environment, and then merged into a single
sketch of the whole data set. In the last decade a variety of sketches have
been developed that are non-mergeable, but attractive for other reasons. They
are simpler, their cardinality estimates are strictly unbiased, and they have
substantially lower variance.
  We evaluate sketching schemes on a reasonably level playing field, in terms
of their memory-variance product (MVP). E.g., a sketch that occupies $5m$ bits
and whose relative variance is $2/m$ (standard error $\sqrt{2/m}$) has an MVP
of $10$. Our contributions are as follows.
  Cohen and Ting independently discovered what we call the Martingale transform
for converting a mergeable sketch into a non-mergeable sketch. We present a
simpler way to analyze the limiting MVP of Martingale-type sketches.
  We prove that the \Martingale{} transform is optimal in the non-mergeable
world, and that \Martingale{} \fishmonger{} in particular is optimal among
linearizable sketches, with an MVP of $H_0/2 \approx 1.63$. E.g., this is
circumstantial evidence that to achieve 1\% standard error, we cannot do better
than a 2 kilobyte sketch.
  \Martingale{} \fishmonger{} is neither simple nor practical. We develop a new
mergeable sketch called \Curtain{} that strikes a nice balance between
simplicity and efficiency, and prove that \Martingale{} \Curtain{} has limiting
$\MVP\approx 2.31$. It can be updated with $O(1)$ memory accesses and it has
lower empirical variance than \Martingale{} \LogLog, a practical non-mergeable

fixed number of data bits to a base station over a shared-spectrum radio link.
Under these settings, we derive the achievability and converse bounds on the
minimum energy-per-bit for reliable random access over quasi-static fading
channels with and without channel state information (CSI) at the receiver.
These bounds provide energy-efficiency guidance for new schemes suited for
massive random access. Simulation results indicate that the orthogonalization

We show that the metamaterial shell facilitates engineering the Mie resonances

Furthermore, we show an absolute conversion efficiency as high as 10^-7 far

theory (DFT). With $a/a_0$ from 0.90 to 1.10, the energy band gap firstly
increases, and then decreases, which is due to transformation of conduction
band minimum (CBM). Calculated results show that the $\mathrm{MoSi_2N_4}$
monolayer is mechanically stable in considered strain range. It is found that
the spin-orbital coupling (SOC) effects on Seebeck coefficient depend on the
strain. In unstrained $\mathrm{MoSi_2N_4}$, the SOC has neglected influence on
Seebeck coefficient. However, the SOC can produce important influence on
Seebeck coefficient, when the strain is applied, for example 0.96 strain. The
compressive strain can change relative position and numbers of conduction band
extrema (CBE), and then the strength of conduction bands convergence can be
enhanced, to the benefit of n-type $ZT_e$. Only about 0.96 strain can
effectively improve n-type $ZT_e$. Our works imply that strain can effectively
tune the electronic structures and transport coefficients of monolayer
$\mathrm{MoSi_2N_4}$, and can motivate farther experimental exploration.

project-join orders to apply additive projections (variable eliminations) and
joins (clause multiplications). In this framework, model counting is performed
in two phases. First, the planning phase constructs a project-join tree from a
formula. Second, the execution phase computes the model count of the formula,
employing dynamic programming as guided by the project-join tree. We
empirically evaluate various methods for the planning phase and compare
constraint-satisfaction heuristics with tree-decomposition tools. We also
investigate the performance of different data structures for the execution

minimum Euclidean distance (ED-WTA) is an intuitive approach to multiclass
classification. By constructing meaningful class centers, PbL provides higher
interpretability and generalization than hyperplane-based learning (HbL)
methods based on maximum Inner Product (IP-WTA) and can efficiently detect and
reject samples that do not belong to any classes. In this paper, we first prove
the equivalence of IP-WTA and ED-WTA from a representational point of view.
Then, we show that naively using this equivalence leads to unintuitive ED-WTA
networks in which the centers have high distances to data that they represent.
We propose $\pm$ED-WTA which models each neuron with two prototypes: one
positive prototype representing samples that are modeled by this neuron and a
negative prototype representing the samples that are erroneously won by that
neuron during training. We propose a novel training algorithm for the
$\pm$ED-WTA network, which cleverly switches between updating the positive and
negative prototypes and is essential to the emergence of interpretable
prototypes. Unexpectedly, we observed that the negative prototype of each
neuron is indistinguishably similar to the positive one. The rationale behind
this observation is that the training data that are mistaken with a prototype
are indeed similar to it. The main finding of this paper is this interpretation
of the functionality of neurons as computing the difference between the
distances to a positive and a negative prototype, which is in agreement with
the BCM theory. In our experiments, we show that the proposed $\pm$ED-WTA
method constructs highly interpretable prototypes that can be successfully used
for detecting outlier and adversarial examples.

quantitative challenge is to determine how the Nusselt number $Nu$ depends on
the Rayleigh number $Ra$ in the $Ra\to\infty$ limit for fluids of fixed finite
Prandtl number $Pr$ in fixed spatial domains. Laboratory experiments, numerical
simulations, and analysis of Rayleigh's mathematical model have yet to rule out
either of the proposed `classical' $Nu \sim Ra^{1/3}$ or `ultimate' $Nu \sim
Ra^{1/2}$ asymptotic scaling theories. Among the many solutions of the
equations of motion at high $Ra$ are steady convection rolls that are
dynamically unstable but share features of the turbulent attractor. We have
computed these steady solutions for $Ra$ up to $10^{14}$ with $Pr=1$ and
various horizontal periods. By choosing the horizontal period of these rolls at
each $Ra$ to maximize $Nu$, we find that steady convection rolls achieve
classical asymptotic scaling. Moreover, they transport more heat than turbulent
convection in experiments or simulations at comparable parameters. If heat
transport in turbulent convection continues to be dominated by heat transport
in steady rolls as $Ra\to\infty$, it cannot achieve the ultimate scaling.

sequence of Bernoulli random variables is a mixture of iid sequences of random
variables. Following the work of Hewitt and Savage, this theorem was previously
known for several classes of exchangeable random variables (for instance, for
Baire measurable random variables taking values in a compact Hausdorff space,
and for Borel measurable random variables taking values in a Polish space).
Under an assumption of the underlying common distribution being Radon, we show
that de Finetti's theorem holds for a sequence of Borel measurable exchangeable
random variables taking values in any Hausdorff space. This includes and
generalizes the previously known versions of de Finetti's theorem. Furthermore,
it shows that the theorem is explainable as a consequence of the nature of the
distribution of the exchangeable random variables as opposed to the topological
nature of their state space, which do not play a key role. Using known relative
consistency results from set theory, this also shows that it is consistent with
the axioms of ZFC that de Finetti's theorem holds for all sequences of
exchangeable random variables taking values in any complete metric space.
  We use nonstandard analysis to first study the empirical measures induced by
hyperfinitely many identically distributed random variables, which leads to a
proof of de Finetti's theorem in great generality while retaining the
combinatorial intuition of proofs of simpler versions of de Finetti's theorem.
An overview of the requisite tools from nonstandard measure theory and
topological meeasure theory is provided, with some new perspectives built at
the interface between these fields as part of that overview. One highlight of
this development is a new generalization of Prokhorov's theorem.

for those models have become an important research problem. However, due to the
structure of decision trees, where each node makes decision purely based on one
feature value, all the previous works only consider the $\ell_\infty$ norm
perturbation. To study robustness with respect to a general $\ell_p$ norm
perturbation, one has to consider the correlation between perturbations on
different features, which has not been handled by previous algorithms. In this
paper, we study the problem of robustness verification and certified defense
with respect to general $\ell_p$ norm perturbations for ensemble decision
stumps and trees. For robustness verification of ensemble stumps, we prove that
complete verification is NP-complete for $p\in(0, \infty)$ while polynomial
time algorithms exist for $p=0$ or $\infty$. For $p\in(0, \infty)$ we develop
an efficient dynamic programming based algorithm for sound verification of
ensemble stumps. For ensemble trees, we generalize the previous multi-level
robustness verification algorithm to $\ell_p$ norm. We demonstrate the first
certified defense method for training ensemble stumps and trees with respect to
$\ell_p$ norm perturbations, and verify its effectiveness empirically on real

For an efficient and robust anemia management system for CKD patients instead
of traditional population-based approaches, individualized patient-specific
approaches are needed. Hence, individualized system (patient) models for
patient-specific drug-dose responses are required. In this research, system
identification for CKD is performed for individual patients. For
control-oriented system identification, two robust identification techniques
are applied: (1) l1 robust identification considering zero initial conditions
and (2) semi-blind robust system identification considering non-zero initial
conditions. The EPO data of patients are used as the input and Hb data is used
as the output of the system. For this study, individualized patient models are
developed by using patient-specific data. The ARX one-step-ahead prediction
technique is used for model validation at real patient data. The performance of
these two techniques is compared by calculating minimum means square error

molecules proceeds easily through participation of additional free catalyst
electrons in the adsorbate bond. As a result, the reaction rate is enhanced and
reaches its maximum value. A further increasing Fermi level of the catalyst
that approaches the antibonding state with ammonia molecules will result in a
smaller fraction of negatively charged ammonia molecules and less
dehydrogenation. Concurrently, the desorption of neutral nitrogen molecules
occurs without impairment. As a result, the reaction rate decreases. The
detailed kinetic model is compared to recent experimental measurements of
ammonia decomposition on iron, cobalt and CoFe bimetallic catalysts.

Attention mechanisms are used to develop the following modules: i) a novel and

geometric size diversity in large-scale remote sensing images; and iii

to evaluate the phase stability of these structures. Twenty of them are found

$\mathrm{Ext}(B,F)$ for pairs of countable abelian groups $B,F$ and definable
$\mathrm{lim}^{1}(\boldsymbol{A})$ for towers $\boldsymbol{A}$ of Polish
abelian groups substantially refine their classical counterparts. We show, for
example, that the definable $\textrm{Ext}(-,\mathbb{Z})$ is a fully faithful
contravariant functor from the category of finite rank torsion-free abelian
groups $\Lambda$ with no free summands; this contrasts with the fact that there
are uncountably many non-isomorphic such groups $\Lambda$ with isomorphic
classical invariants $\textrm{Ext}(\Lambda,\mathbb{Z}) $. To facilitate our
analysis, we introduce a general Ulam stability framework for groups with a
Polish cover and we prove several rigidity results for non-Archimedean abelian
groups with a Polish cover. A special case of our main result answers a
question of Kanovei and Reeken regarding quotients of the $p$-adic groups.

during the mass transfer in the Beta Lyrae system. It is shown that the
structure of the gaseous flows between the donor and the gainer is due to the
spatial configuration of the donor magnetic field. Its dipole axis is deviated
substantially from the line joining the centers of the components and is
inclined to the orbital plane of the binary system; the center of the magnetic
dipole is displaced from the donor center toward the gainer. The surface around
the donor magnetic pole, which is close to the gainer, is a region of an
additional matter loss from the donor surface. The effective collision of the
magnetized plasma with the accretion disk is enhanced by the fast
counter-rotation of this disk, especially in the secondary quadrature phases,
in which the high-temperature medium and the system of formed accretion flows
are observed. This concept is demonstrated, primarily, in the obvious
correlations between the phase variability of the donor magnetic field and the
corresponding variability of the dynamic and energy characteristics of the
various complex lines. This refers to the behavior of the radial velocity
curves of the emission-absorption lines formed in the gaseous structures of
type H$\alpha$, HeI $\lambda$ 7065, or the variability of their equivalent
width and intensity, and the variability of conventional absorption lines of
the donor atmosphere. This is true for the phase variability of the absolute
flux in the H$\alpha$ emission line and the fast varying of the continuum in
the H$\alpha$ region as certain parameters, which reflect the phase variability
of the donor magnetic field. This approach made it possible to determine the
phase boundaries of the location of the magnetic polar region on the donor
surface above which the matter outflows are formed.

and obstruction of the facial expression production, whilst allowing EMG
measurements. However, measuring EMG distally entails that the exact source of
the facial movement is unknown. We propose a novel method to estimate specific
Facial Action Units (AUs) from distal facial EMG and Computer Vision (CV). This
method is based on Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Non-Negative Matrix
Factorization (NNMF), and sorting of the resulting components to determine
which is the most likely to correspond to each CV-labeled action unit (AU).
Performance on the detection of AU06 (Orbicularis Oculi) and AU12 (Zygomaticus

results of our proposed algorithm showed an accuracy of 81% and a Cohen's Kappa
of 0.49 for AU6; and accuracy of 82% and a Cohen's Kappa of 0.53 for AU12. This
demonstrates the potential of distal EMG to detect individual facial movements.
Using this multimodal method, several AU synergies were identified. We
quantified the co-occurrence and timing of AU6 and AU12 in posed and
spontaneous smiles using the human-coded labels, and for comparison, using the
continuous CV-labels. The co-occurrence analysis was also performed on the

  Methods: The proposed approach was implemented on a system which allows
real-time data processing and real-time control on the sequence. Real-time
center frequency calibration upon the bolus arrival was also added. The
feasibility of applying the proposed framework for in vivo hyperpolarized

real-time acquired B$_1$ maps. Flip angle correction using B$_1$ maps results
in a more consistent quantification of metabolic activity (i.e,

factor and small modal volume resonances. Critical to such studies is the
ability to control the relative frequencies of the cavity modes, so that
frequency matching is achieved to satisfy energy conservation. Typically this
is done by tailoring the resonator cross-section. Doing so modifies the
frequencies of all of the cavity modes, that is, the global dispersion profile,
which may be undesired, for example, in introducing competing nonlinear
processes.Here, we demonstrate a frequency engineering tool, termed multiple
selective mode splitting (MSMS), that is independent of the global dispersion
and instead allows targeted and independent control of the frequencies of
multiple cavity modes. In particular, we show controllable frequency shifts up
to 0.8 nm, independent control of the splitting of up to five cavity modes with
optical quality factors $\gtrsim 10^5$, and strongly suppressed frequency
shifts for untargeted modes. The MSMS technique can be broadly applied to a
wide variety of nonlinear optical processes across different material
platforms, and can be used to both selectively enhance processes of interestand
suppress competing unwanted processes.

envy-freeness up to any item (EFX), where no agent envies another agent after
the removal of any single item from the other agent's bundle. However, despite
significant efforts by many researchers for several years, it is known that a
complete EFX allocation always exists only in limited cases. In this paper, we

evaluation of adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming algorithms and objective
quality-of-experience (QoE) models. Here we introduce so-far the largest
subject-rated database of its kind, namely WaterlooSQoE-IV, consisting of 1350
adaptive streaming videos created from diverse source contents, video encoders,
network traces, ABR algorithms, and viewing devices. We collect human opinions
for each video with a series of carefully designed subjective experiments.
Subsequent data analysis and testing/comparison of ABR algorithms and QoE
models using the database lead to a series of novel observations and
interesting findings, in terms of the effectiveness of subjective experiment
methodologies, the interactions between user experience and source content,
viewing device and encoder type, the heterogeneities in the bias and preference
of user experiences, the behaviors of ABR algorithms, and the performance of
objective QoE models. Most importantly, our results suggest that a better
objective QoE model, or a better understanding of human perceptual experience
and behaviour, is the most dominating factor in improving the performance of
ABR algorithms, as opposed to advanced optimization frameworks, machine
learning strategies or bandwidth predictors, where a majority of ABR research
has been focused on in the past decade. On the other hand, our performance
evaluation of 11 QoE models shows only a moderate correlation between
state-of-the-art QoE models and subjective ratings, implying rooms for
improvement in both QoE modeling and ABR algorithms. The database is made

reinforcement learning methods make an efficient performance in coordination
tasks. Most current methods assume that agents can make communication to assist
decisions, which is impractical in some situations. In this paper, we propose a
semi-communication method to enable agents can exchange information without
communication. Specifically, we introduce a group concept to help agents
learning a belief which is a type of consensus. With this consensus, adjacent
agents tend to accomplish similar sub-tasks to achieve cooperation. We design a
novel agent structure named Belief in Graph Clustering(BGC), composed of an
agent characteristic module, a belief module, and a fusion module. To represent
each agent characteristic, we use an MLP-based characteristic module to
generate agent unique features. Inspired by the neighborhood cognitive
consistency, we propose a group-based module to divide adjacent agents into a
small group and minimize in-group agents' beliefs to accomplish similar
sub-tasks. Finally, we use a hyper-network to merge these features and produce
agent actions. To overcome the agent consistent problem brought by GAT, a split
loss is introduced to distinguish different agents. Results reveal that the
proposed method achieves a significant improvement in the SMAC benchmark.
Because of the group concept, our approach maintains excellent performance with
an increase in the number of agents.

agent in discrete steps. The problem is to find an optimal sequence of nodes
which have to be given information so that the network is covered in least
number of steps. Graph burning problem is NP-Hard for which two approximation
algorithms and a few heuristics have been proposed in the literature. In this
work, we propose three heuristics, namely, Backbone Based Greedy Heuristic
(BBGH), Improved Cutting Corners Heuristic (ICCH) and Component Based Recursive
Heuristic (CBRH). These are mainly based on Eigenvector centrality measure.
BBGH finds a backbone of the network and picks vertex to be burned greedily
from the vertices of the backbone. ICCH is a shortest path based heuristic and
picks vertex to burn greedily from best central nodes. The burning number
problem on disconnected graphs is harder than on the connected graphs. For
example, burning number problem is easy on a path where as it is NP-Hard on
disjoint paths. In practice, large networks are generally disconnected and
moreover even if the input graph is connected, during the burning process the
graph among the unburned vertices may be disconnected. For disconnected graphs,
ordering of the components is crucial. Our CBRH works well on disconnected
graphs as it prioritizes the components. All the heuristics have been
implemented and tested on several bench-mark networks including large networks
of size more than $50$K nodes. The experimentation also includes comparison to
the approximation algorithms. The advantages of our algorithms are that they
are much simpler to implement and also several orders faster than the
heuristics proposed in the literature.

including animal behavior, single-cell behavior, and embryonic development. Yet
we currently do not know of a naturally existing biological system that is
capable of universal computation, i.e., Turing-equivalent in scope. Generic
finite-dimensional dynamical systems (which encompass most models of neural
networks, intracellular signaling cascades, and gene regulatory networks) fall
short of universal computation, but are assumed to be capable of explaining
cognition and development. I present a class of models that bridge two concepts
from distant fields: combinatory logic (or, equivalently, lambda calculus) and
RNA molecular biology. A set of basic RNA editing rules can make it possible to
compute any computable function with identical algorithmic complexity to that
of Turing machines. The models do not assume extraordinarily complex molecular
machinery or any processes that radically differ from what we already know to
occur in cells. Distinct independent enzymes can mediate each of the rules and
RNA molecules solve the problem of parenthesis matching through their secondary
structure. In the most plausible of these models all of the editing rules can
be implemented with merely cleavage and ligation operations at fixed positions
relative to predefined motifs. This demonstrates that universal computation is
well within the reach of molecular biology. It is therefore reasonable to
assume that life has evolved - or possibly began with - a universal computer
that yet remains to be discovered. The variety of seemingly unrelated
computational problems across many scales can potentially be solved using the
same RNA-based computation system. Experimental validation of this theory may
immensely impact our understanding of memory, cognition, development, disease,
evolution, and the early stages of life.

and He abundance (\ahe), may be different for plasmas originating from
differing processes or regions on the Sun. Thus, it is crucial to examine the
relationship between in-situ measurements of CME composition and activity on
the Sun. We study the CME that erupted on 2014 September 10, in association
with an X1.6 flare, by analyzing AIA imaging and IRIS spectroscopic
observations and its in-situ signatures detected by Wind and ACE. We find that
during the slow expansion and intensity increase of the sigmoid, plasma
temperatures of 9 MK, and higher, first appear at the footpoints of the
sigmoid, associated with chromospheric brightening. Then the high-temperature
region extends along the sigmoid. IRIS observations confirm that this extension
is caused by transportation of hot plasma upflow. Our results show that
chromospheric material can be heated to 9 MK, and above, by chromospheric
evaporation at the sigmoid footpoints before flare onset. The heated
chromospheric material can transport into the sigmoidal structure and supply
mass to the CME. The aforementioned CME mass supply scenario provides a
reasonable explanation for the detection of high charge states and elevated
\ahe\ in the associated ICME. The observations also demonstrate that the
quasi-steady evolution in the precursor phase is dominated by magnetic
reconnection between the rising flux rope and the overlying magnetic field

for various online updating estimations in the models with streaming data sets.
The newly defined RWS lays the foundation of online updating likelihood, online

of RWS is intuitive and heuristic, and the algorithm is computationally simple.
This paper chooses nonparametric model as an exemplary setting. The RWS applies
to various types of nonparametric estimators, which include but are not limited
to nonparametric likelihood, quasi-likelihood and least squares. Furthermore,
the method and the theory can be extended into the models with both parameter
and nonparametric function. The estimation consistency and asymptotic normality
of the proposed renewable estimator are established, and the oracle property is
obtained. Moreover, these properties are always satisfied, without any
constraint on the number of data batches, which means that the new method is
adaptive to the situation where streaming data sets arrive perpetually. The
behavior of the method is further illustrated by various numerical examples
from simulation experiments and real data analysis.

are explained by the excitation of electrons. The Bethe-Salpeter equation is
the state-of-the-art approach to describe these processes from first principles
(ab initio), i.e. without the need for empirical data in the model. To harness
the predictive power of the equation, it is mapped to an eigenvalue problem via
an appropriate discretization scheme. The eigenpairs of the resulting large,
dense, structured matrix can be used to compute dielectric properties of the
considered crystalline or molecular system. The matrix always shows a $2\times
2$ block structure. Additionally, certain definiteness properties typically
hold. One form can be acquired for crystalline systems, another one is more
general and can for example be used to study molecules. In this work, we
present new theoretical results characterizing the structure of the two forms
in the language of non-standard scalar products. These results enable us to
develop a new perspective on the state-of-the-art solution approach for
crystalline systems. This new viewpoint is used to develop two new methods for
solving the eigenvalue problem. One requires less computational effort while
providing the same degree of accuracy. The other one improves the expected
accuracy, compared to methods currently in use, with a comparable performance.
Both methods are well suited for high performance environments and only rely on
basic numerical linear algebra building blocks.

purely algebro-geometric invariants $\delta_m$ whose limit in $m$ is now known

this carries over to a general polarization, and together with work of Berman,
Boucksom, and Jonsson, it is now known that the limit of these

quantized Ding functional on the $m$-th Bergman space and thus characterizes
the existence of balanced metrics. This approach has a number of applications.
The most basic one is that it provides an alternative way to compute these
invariants, which is new even for $\mathbb{P}^n$. Second, it allows us to
introduce algebraically defined invariants that characterize the existence of
K\""ahler-Ricci solitons (and the more general $g$-solitons of Berman-Witt

we study load balancing on a bipartite graph where left nodes correspond to job

job type can be served by a server. Thus edges represent locality constraints,
i.e., each job can only be served at servers which contained certain data
and/or machine learning (ML) models. Servers in this system can have
heterogeneous service rates. In this setting, we investigate the performance of
two policies named Join-the-Fastest-of-the-Shortest-Queue (JFSQ) and
Join-the-Fastest-of-the-Idle-Queue (JFIQ), which are simple variants of
Join-the-Shortest-Queue and Join-the-Idle-Queue, where ties are broken in favor
of the fastest servers. Under a ""well-connected"" graph condition, we show that
JFSQ and JFIQ are asymptotically optimal in the mean response time when the
number of servers goes to infinity. In addition to asymptotic optimality, we
also obtain upper bounds on the mean response time for finite-size systems. We
further show that the well-connectedness condition can be satisfied by a random

star-forming galaxies drawn from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF)
survey. Doubly-ionized neon ([NeIII]3869) is detected at $\geq3\sigma$ in 61
galaxies, representing $\sim$25% of the MOSDEF sample with H$\alpha$, H$\beta$,
and [OIII]$5007$ detections at similar redshifts. We consider the neon
emission-line properties of both individual galaxies with [NeIII]3869
detections and composite $z\sim2$ spectra binned by stellar mass. With no
requirement of [NeIII]3869 detection, the latter provide a more representative
picture of neon emission-line properties in the MOSDEF sample. The
[NeIII]3869/[OII]3727 ratio (Ne3O2) is anti-correlated with stellar mass in
$z\sim2$ galaxies, as expected based on the mass-metallicity relation. It is
also positively correlated with the [OIII]$5007$/[OII]$3727$ ratio (O32), but
$z\sim2$ line ratios are offset towards higher Ne3O2 at fixed O32, compared
with both local star-forming galaxies and individual H~II regions. Despite the
offset towards higher Ne3O2 at fixed O32 at $z\sim2$, biases in inferred
Ne3O2-based metallicity are small. Accordingly, Ne3O2 may serve as an important
metallicity indicator deep into the reionization epoch. Analyzing additional
rest-optical line ratios including [NeIII]$3869$/[OIII]$5007$ (Ne3O3) and
[OIII]$5007$/H$\beta$ (O3H$\beta$), we conclude that the nebular emission-line
ratios of $z\sim2$ star-forming galaxies suggest a harder ionizing spectrum
(lower stellar metallicity, i.e., Fe/H) at fixed gas-phase oxygen abundance,
compared to systems at $z\sim0$. These new results based on neon lend support
to the physical picture painted by oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur
emission, of an ionized ISM in high-redshift star-forming galaxies irradiated
by chemically young, $\alpha$-enhanced massive stars.

signal can be identified with a point in a multi-dimensional space. Such a
point depends on the sampled signal, the sampling period, and the starting time
of the sequence. If the starting time varies, then the corresponding point
moves along a closed curve. We prove that such a curve, i.e., the set of all
sample trains of a given length, determines the period of the sampled signal,
provided that the sampling period is known. This is true even if the trains are
short, and if the samples comprising trains are taken at a sub-Nyquist rate.
The presented result is proved with a help of the theory of rotation numbers
developed by Poincar\'e. We also prove that the curve of sample trains
determines the sampled signal up to a time shift, provided that the ratio of
the sampling period to the period of the signal is irrational. Eventually, we
give an example which shows that the assumption on incommensurability of the
periods cannot be dropped.

penalty function is formulated by comparing the colliding trajectory with a
collision-free guiding path. The resulting obstacle information will be stored
only if the trajectory hits new obstacles, making the planner only extract
necessary obstacle information. Then, we lengthen the time allocation if
dynamical feasibility is violated. An anisotropic curve fitting algorithm is
introduced to adjust higher-order derivatives of the trajectory while
maintaining the original shape. Benchmark comparisons and real-world

the loss of energy in the backward pass during training nullifies the learning
of the layers closer to the input. Then, we propose several methodologies to
mitigate the training problem by slightly modifying the GCN operator, from the

between a Sun-Jupiter pair and both binary and single stars as in young
clusters. We first perform a set of simulations of encounters involving wide
ranges of binaries and single stars, finding that wider binaries have larger
cross sections for the planet's ejection. Secondly, we consider such
scatterings in a realistic population, drawing parameters for the binaries and
single stars from the observed population. The scattering outcomes are diverse,
including ejection, capture/exchange and collision. The binaries are more
effective than single stars by a factor of several or more in causing the
planet's ejection and collision. Hence, in a cluster, as long as the binary
fraction is larger than about 10 per cent, the binaries will dominate the
scatterings in terms of these two outcomes. For an open cluster of a stellar
density 50 pc$^{-3}$, a lifetime 100 Myr and a binary fraction 0.5, we estimate
that of the order of 1 per cent of the Jupiters are ejected, 0.1 per cent
collide with a star, 0.1 per cent change ownership and 10 per cent of the
Sun-Jupiter pairs acquire a stellar companion during scatterings. These
companions are typically 1000s of au distant and in half of the cases (so 5 per

Kozai--Lidov mechanism before stripped by later encounters. Our result suggests
that the Solar System may have once had a companion in its birth cluster.

two-channel filtering process that, in theory, is beneficial for enriching the

easily patched on existing GNN methods with diverse training strategies,

reproducing the distinct isotopic compositions of the Earth and Mars for both
classical and Grand Tack models is very low. In the framework of the Grand Tack
model, for Mars to be isotopically different from the Earth, it had to form
under very specific conditions. Here, we subjected a fairly new and unexplored
model--the depleted disc model--to the test. It presupposes that the region in
the inner protoplanetary disc from Mars' orbit and beyond is depleted in mass
such that Mars is left with insufficient material to grow to a larger size. Our
aim is to test the whether the distinct isotopic compositions of the Earth and
Mars are a natural outcome of this model. We found that the terrestrial planets
accrete material mostly locally and have feeding zones that are sufficiently
distinct. The Earth and Mars, and by extension, Venus, can have distinct
isotopic compositions if there is an isotopic gradient in the terrestrial
planet region of the protoplanetary disc. Our results suggest that the material
in the inner Solar System most likely did not undergo substantial mixing that
homogenised the potential isotopic gradient, in contrast to the Grand Tack

the flow laminarises after a sudden reduction in Reynolds number $Re$.
Specifically, we study the velocity field in the streamwise-spanwise plane. We
show that the spanwise velocity containing rolls, decays faster than the
streamwise velocity, which displays elongated regions of higher or lower
velocity called streaks. At final Reynolds numbers above 425, the decay of
streaks displays two stages: first a slow decay when rolls are present and
secondly a more rapid decay of streaks alone. The difference in behaviour
results from the regeneration of streaks by rolls, called the lift-up effect.
We define the turbulent fraction as the portion of the flow containing
turbulence and this is estimated by thresholding the spanwise velocity
component. It decreases linearly with time in the whole range of final $Re$.
The corresponding decay slope increases linearly with final $Re$. The
extrapolated value at which this decay slope vanishes is $Re_{a_z}\approx
656\pm10$, close to $Re_g\approx 670$ at which turbulence is self-sustained.
The decay of the energy computed from the spanwise velocity component is found
to be exponential. The corresponding decay rate increases linearly with $Re$,
with an extrapolated vanishing value at $Re_{A_z}\approx 688\pm10$. This value
is also close to the value at which the turbulence is self-sustained, showing
that valuable information on the transition can be obtained over a wide range

the criterion of maximal initial energy dissipation selects a linear density
profile and a quadratic growth of the mixing zone. The subsolution selected
this way can be extended in an admissible way to exist for all times. We
provide two possible extensions with different long-time limits. The first one
corresponds to a total mixture of the two fluids, the second corresponds to a
full separation with the lighter fluid on top of the heavier. There is no
motion in either of the limit states.

drastically increased over the past decade, with many aiming to automate one of
the first steps in a fact-check procedure: the selection of so-called
checkworthy claims. However, there is little agreement on the definition and
characteristics of checkworthiness among fact-checkers, which is consequently
reflected in the datasets used for training and testing checkworthy claim
detection models. After elaborate analysis of checkworthy claim selection
procedures in fact-check organisations and analysis of state-of-the-art claim
detection datasets, checkworthiness is defined as the concept of having a
spatiotemporal and context-dependent worth and need to have the correctness of
the objectivity it conveys verified. This is irrespective of the claim's
perceived veracity judgement by an individual based on prior knowledge and
beliefs. Concerning the characteristics of current datasets, it is argued that
the data is not only highly imbalanced and noisy, but also too limited in scope
and language. Furthermore, we believe that the subjective concept of
checkworthiness might not be a suitable filter for claim detection.

  In this paper, we propose and evaluate the use of a model-based test

dynamic, less brittle, and implementation simple test cases. The test execution
on multiple real devices with different configurations increase the confidence
in the implementation of the system under test. Our evaluation shows that the
used approach produces a high coverage of the parts of the application related

generation is required in order to additionally increase the coverage of the
complete application. Furthermore, we present the lessons learned while

Numerical error in
constructing a model field and computing the divergence, however, introduces a
finite divergence into these calculations. A popular metric for measuring
divergence is the average fractional flux $\langle |f_{i}| \rangle$. We show
that $\langle |f_{i}| \rangle$ scales with the size of the computational mesh,
and may be a poor measure of divergence because it becomes arbitrarily small
for increasing mesh resolution, without the divergence actually decreasing. We
define a modified version of this metric that does not scale with mesh size. We
apply the new metric to the results of DeRosa et al. (2015), who measured
$\langle |f_{i}| \rangle$ for a series of Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF)
models of the coronal magnetic field based on solar boundary data binned at
different spatial resolutions. We compute a number of divergence metrics for
the DeRosa et al. (2015) data and analyze the effect of spatial resolution on
these metrics using a non-parametric method. We find that some of the trends
reported by DeRosa et al. (2015) are due to the intrinsic scaling of $\langle
|f_{i}| \rangle$. We also find that different metrics give different results
for the same data set and therefore there is value in measuring divergence via
several metrics.

problem that the feature maps commonly used in anti-spoofing networks are
insufficient for building discriminative representations of audio segments, as
they are often extracted by a single-length sliding window. Resulting
trade-offs between time and frequency resolutions restrict the information in
single spectrograms. The proposed method improves both frequency resolution and
time resolution by stacking multiple spectrograms that are extracted using
different window lengths. These are fed into a convolutional neural network in
the form of multiple channels, making it possible to extract more information
from input signals while only marginally increasing computational costs. The
efficiency of the proposed method has been conformed on the ASVspoof 2019

consistently outperforms that of score fusion across different CNN
architectures. Moreover, computational cost remains small.

extrapolated with the data observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager

are two flux ropes in this active region, covered by a large scale hyperbolic
flux tube (HFT), which is the intersection of quasi-separatrix layers with a
null point embedded in it. When the background magnetic field diminishes due to
the separation of the northwest dipole and the flux cancellation, the central
flux rope rises up forming the two brightest central ribbons. It then squeezes
the upper lying HFT structure to generate further brightenings. This very
energetic flare with a complex shape is accompanied by a coronal mass ejection
(CME). We adopt the simplified line-tied force-balance equation of the current
ring model and assign the observed value of the decay index to the equation to
simulate the acceleration profile of the CME in the early stage. It is found
that the path with an inclination of $45^\circ$ from radial best fits the

optimization and the hessian evaluation along the path. The method can thus be

atherosclerosis. How does a low shear stress damage the vessel or aggravate
atherosclerosis? It is a puzzling question. Furthermore, shear stress of veins
is similar to that of Relatively Vulnerable Zones (RVZ) of arteries, while
intimal thickening of veins is not obvious as the arteries. There are many
places in arterioles with lower shear stress as the decrease of blood velocity,
while the thickening of arterioles is not as obvious as that of the
medium-sized arteries. These issues make it unconvincing for us to explain
atherogenesis with lower shear stress. According to Bernoulli fluid equation
(P+1/2\r{ho}v^2+\r{ho}gh=constant), in a closed pipe full of flowing blood, at
the same height, the hydrostatic pressure is inversely proportional to the
second power of blood velocity. At any point of per unit mass of fluid micro
cluster here, the reduction of 1/2\r{ho}v^2 would be converted into P.
Therefore, hydrostatic pressure(P) is inversely proportional to v^2 in a very
short distance or in the same transection of the artery. When blood micro
cluster flows over a very short distance or the same transection of the artery,
previous studies did not consider the conversion between 1/2\r{ho}v^2 and P.
Therefore, low shear stress aggravates atherosclerosis is an appearance, and
the essence is that these areas with smaller blood velocity have much bigger
hydrostatic pressure, which aggravates atherosclerosis. This perfectly explains
the predisposing sites of atherosclerosis.

several non-neoplastic kidney diseases sampled from 58 unique subjects. A
second study performed by three pathologists found that the quality of the
special stains generated by the stain transformation network was statistically
equivalent to those generated through standard histochemical staining. As the
transformation of H&E images into special stains can be achieved within 1 min

Specifically, we focus on correlations of local operators that conserve the

two-point functions. With the method developed being generally applicable to
any finite energy and entropy state, our primary focus is on the thermal
states. To exemplify this approach, we chose the Lieb-Liniger model and study
the leading contribution from 2-particle-hole excitations at small momenta to
the dynamic density-density correlation function. We also consider analogous

Various approaches suggested in the literature to weigh the ensemble models use
a static set of weights. Due to this limitation, approaches using a static set
of weights for weighing ensemble models cannot capture the dynamic changes or
local features of the data effectively. To address this issue, a Reinforcement
Learning (RL) approach to dynamically assign and update weights of each of the

individual joints or skeletons, and the frequent frame-wise reconstruction in
state-of-the-art methods greatly limit 3D accuracy and temporal stability
compared to multi-view or marker-based motion capture. Further, captured 3D
poses are often physically incorrect and biomechanically implausible, or
exhibit implausible environment interactions (floor penetration, foot skating,
unnatural body leaning and strong shifting in depth), which is problematic for
any use case in computer graphics. We, therefore, present PhysCap, the first
algorithm for physically plausible, real-time and marker-less human 3D motion
capture with a single colour camera at 25 fps. Our algorithm first captures 3D
human poses purely kinematically. To this end, a CNN infers 2D and 3D joint
positions, and subsequently, an inverse kinematics step finds space-time
coherent joint angles and global 3D pose. Next, these kinematic reconstructions
are used as constraints in a real-time physics-based pose optimiser that
accounts for environment constraints (e.g., collision handling and floor
placement), gravity, and biophysical plausibility of human postures. Our
approach employs a combination of ground reaction force and residual force for
plausible root control, and uses a trained neural network to detect foot
contact events in images. Our method captures physically plausible and
temporally stable global 3D human motion, without physically implausible

samples using inner updates from a meta-initialization point and learns the
meta-initialization parameters with outer updates. It has recently been
hypothesized that representation reuse, which makes little change in efficient
representations, is the dominant factor in the performance of the
meta-initialized model through MAML in contrast to representation change, which
causes a significant change in representations. In this study, we investigate
the necessity of representation change for the ultimate goal of few-shot
learning, which is solving domain-agnostic tasks. To this aim, we propose a
novel meta-learning algorithm, called BOIL (Body Only update in Inner Loop),
which updates only the body (extractor) of the model and freezes the head
(classifier) during inner loop updates. BOIL leverages representation change
rather than representation reuse. This is because feature vectors
(representations) have to move quickly to their corresponding frozen head
vectors. We visualize this property using cosine similarity, CKA, and empirical
results without the head. BOIL empirically shows significant performance
improvement over MAML, particularly on cross-domain tasks. The results imply
that representation change in gradient-based meta-learning approaches is a
critical component.

Heisenberg's uncertainty principle into quantum multiparameter estimation by
giving a tradeoff relation between the measurement inaccuracies for estimating

near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) require considerable computational
resources. NFRHT for the simple one-dimensional nanoparticle chains embedded in
a non-absorbing host medium is investigated from the point of view of the
continuum by means of an approach combining the many-body radiative heat
transfer theory and the Fourier law. Effects of the phase change of the
insulator-metal transition material (VO$_2$), the complex many-body interaction
(MBI) and the host medium relative permittivity on the characteristic effective
thermal conductivity (ETC) are analyzed. The ETC for VO$_2$ nanoparticle chains
below the transition temperature can be as high as 50 times of that above the
transition temperature due to the phase change effect. The strong coupling in
the insulator-phase VO$_2$ nanoparticle chain accounts for its high ETC as
compared to the low ETC for the chain at the metallic phase, where there is a
mismatch between the characteristic thermal frequency and resonance frequency.
The strong MBI is in favor of the ETC. For SiC nanoparticle chains, the MBI
even can double the ETC as compared to those without considering the MBI
effect. For the dense chains, a strong MBI enhances the ETC due to the strong
inter-particles couplings. When the chains go more and more dilute, the MBI can
be neglected safely due to negligible couplings. The host medium relative
permittivity significantly affects the inter-particles couplings, which
accounts for the permittivity-dependent ETC for the VO$_2$ nanoparticle chains.

the magnetic field may be changing rapidly, total sensing time is crucial and
must be minimised. Bayesian estimation and adaptive experiment optimisation can
speed up the sensing process by reducing the number of measurements required.
These protocols consist of computing and updating the probability distribution
of the magnetic field based on measurement outcomes and of determining
optimized acquisition settings for the next measurement. However, the
computational steps feeding into the measurement settings of the next iteration
must be performed quickly enough to allow for real-time updates. This article
addresses the issue of computational speed by implementing an approximate
Bayesian estimation technique, where probability distributions are approximated
by a finite sum of Gaussian functions. Given that only three parameters are
required to fully describe a Gaussian density, we find that in many cases, the
magnetic field probability distribution can be described by fewer than ten
parameters, achieving a reduction in computation time by factor 10 compared to
existing approaches. For T2* = 1 micro second, only a small decrease in
computation time is achieved. However, in these regimes, the proposed Gaussian
protocol outperforms the existing one in tracking accuracy.

representations such as AMR are typically evaluated using automatic surface
matching metrics that compare the generated texts to reference texts from which

when applying these metrics for AMR-to-text evaluation, since an abstract
meaning representation allows for numerous surface realizations. In this work
we aim to alleviate these issues by proposing $\mathcal{M}\mathcal{F}_\beta$, a
decomposable metric that builds on two pillars. The first is the principle of
meaning preservation $\mathcal{M}$: it measures to what extent a given AMR can
be reconstructed from the generated sentence using SOTA AMR parsers and
applying (fine-grained) AMR evaluation metrics to measure the distance between
the original and the reconstructed AMR. The second pillar builds on a principle
of (grammatical) form $\mathcal{F}$ that measures the linguistic quality of the
generated text, which we implement using SOTA language models. In two extensive
pilot studies we show that fulfillment of both principles offers benefits for
AMR-to-text evaluation, including explainability of scores. Since
$\mathcal{M}\mathcal{F}_\beta$ does not necessarily rely on gold AMRs, it may
extend to other text generation tasks.

with respect to target strains is formulated and minimized with the given set

reflected signals from a target (i.e., RADAR and LIDAR), cannot work without
line-of-sight. Besides, it takes significant time for environment scanning and
object recognition with potential detection inaccuracy, especially in complex
urban situations. Some recent fatal accidents involving autonomous vehicles
further expose such limitations. In this paper, we aim at overcoming these
limitations by proposing a novel relative positioning approach, called
Cooperative Multi-point Positioning (COMPOP). The COMPOP establishes
cooperation between a target vehicle (TV) and a sensing vehicle (SV) if a LoS
path exists, where a TV explicitly lets an SV to know the TV's existence by
transmitting positioning waveforms. This cooperation makes it possible to
remove the time-consuming scanning and target recognizing processes,
facilitating real-time positioning. One prerequisite for the cooperation is a
clock synchronization between a pair of TV and SV. To this end, we use a
phase-differential-of-arrival based approach to remove the TV-SV clock
difference from the received signal. With clock difference correction, the TV's
position can be obtained via peak detection over a 3D power spectrum
constructed by a Fourier transform (FT) based algorithm. The COMPOP also
incorporates nearby vehicles, without knowing their locations, into the above
cooperation for the case without a LoS path. The effectiveness of the COMPOP is
verified by several simulations concerning practical channel parameters.

proposed with resolution completeness guarantee. However, a smooth reference
trajectory and a low-level safety-critical controller were lacking. In this
work, we propose a novel construction of a $C^2$ continuous reference
trajectory based on B\'ezier curves on $ SO(3) $ that evolves within
predetermined cells and eliminates previous stop-and-go behavior. Moreover, we
propose a novel zeroing control barrier function on $ SO(3) $ that provides a
safety certificate over a set of overlapping cells on $ SO(3) $ while avoiding
nonsmooth analysis. The safety certificate is given as a linear constraint on
the control input and implemented in real-time. A remedy is proposed to handle
the states where the coefficient of the control input in the linear constraint
vanishes. Numerical simulations are given to verify the advantages of the
proposed method.

Jordan curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The Plateau-Douglas problem asks whether there
exists a minimizer of area among all compact surfaces of genus at most $p$
which span $\Gamma$. While the solution to this problem is well-known, the
classical approaches break down if one allows for singular configurations
$\Gamma$ where the curves are potentially non-disjoint or self-intersecting.
Our main result solves the Plateau-Douglas problem for such potentially
singular configurations. Moreover, our proof works not only in $\mathbb{R}^n$
but in general proper metric spaces. Thus we are also able to extend previously
known existence results of J\""urgen Jost as well as of the second author
together with Stefan Wenger for regular configurations. In particular,
existence is new for disjoint configurations of Jordan curves in general
complete Riemannian manifolds. A minimal surface of fixed genus $p$ bounding a
given configuration $\Gamma$ need not always exist, even in the most regular
settings. Concerning this problem, we also generalize the approach for singular
configurations via minimal sequences satisfying conditions of cohesion and
adhesion to the setting of metric spaces.

supports unbalanced three phase networks with delta and wye connections, and
incorporates the charging needs of EVs. The solution of the centralised market
requires knowledge of EV information in terms of desired energy, departure and

understand the size distribution of the interplanetary dust. However, faint
meteors detected by high power large aperture radar observations, which are
typically as faint as 10 mag. in optical, have not been detected until recently
in optical observations, mainly due to insufficient sensitivity of the optical
observations. In this paper, two radar and optical simultaneous observations
were organized. The first observation was carried out in 2009 to 2010 using
Middle and Upper Atmosphere Radar (MU radar) and an image-intensified CCD
camera. The second observation was carried out in 2018 using the MU radar and a
mosaic CMOS camera, Tomo-e Gozen, mounted on the 1.05-m Kiso Schmidt Telescope.
In total, 331 simultaneous meteors were detected. The relationship between
radar cross sections and optical V-band magnitudes was well approximated by a
linear function. A transformation function from the radar cross section to the
V-band magnitude was derived for sporadic meteors. The transformation function
was applied to about 150,000 meteors detected by the MU radar in 2009--2015,
large part of which are sporadic, and a luminosity function was derived in the
magnitude range of $-1.5$ to $9.5$ mag. The luminosity function was well
approximated by a single power-law function with the population index of $r =
3.52{\pm}0.12$. The present observation indicates that the MU radar has
capability to detect interplanetary dust of $10^{-5}$ to $10^{0}$ g in mass as
meteors.

task. Previous works have made progresses on discriminating whether a video
sequencecontains anomalies. However, most of them fail to accurately localize
the anomalous events within videos in the temporal domain. In this paper, we
propose a Weakly Supervised Anomaly Localization (WSAL) method focusing on
temporally localizing anomalous segments within anomalous videos. Inspired by
the appearance difference in anomalous videos, the evolution of adjacent
temporal segments is evaluated for the localization of anomalous segments. To
this end, a high-order context encoding model is proposed to not only extract
semantic representations but also measure the dynamic variations so that the
temporal context could be effectively utilized. In addition, in order to fully
utilize the spatial context information, the immediate semantics are directly
derived from the segment representations. The dynamic variations as well as the
immediate semantics, are efficiently aggregated to obtain the final anomaly
scores. An enhancement strategy is further proposed to deal with noise
interference and the absence of localization guidance in anomaly detection.
Moreover, to facilitate the diversity requirement for anomaly detection
benchmarks, we also collect a new traffic anomaly (TAD) dataset which specifies
in the traffic conditions, differing greatly from the current popular anomaly
detection evaluation benchmarks.Extensive experiments are conducted to verify
the effectiveness of different components, and our proposed method achieves new
state-of-the-art performance on the UCF-Crime and TAD datasets.

finite precision channel state information at the transmitters (CSIT). We
consider downlink settings modeled by the interfering broadcast channel (IBC)
under no multi-cell cooperation, and the overloaded
multiple-input-single-output broadcast channel (MISO-BC) under full multi-cell
cooperation. We focus on three regimes of interest: the mc-TIN regime, where a
scheme based on treating inter-cell interference as noise (mc-TIN) was shown to
be GDoF optimal for the IBC; the mc-CTIN regime, where the GDoF region
achievable by mc-TIN is convex without the need for time-sharing; and the
mc-SLS regime which extends a previously identified regime, where a simple
layered superposition (SLS) scheme is optimal for the 3-transmitter-3-user
MISO-BC, to overloaded cellular-type networks with more users than
transmitters. We first show that the optimality of mc-TIN for the IBC extends
to the entire mc-CTIN regime when CSIT is limited to finite precision. The
converse proof of this result relies on a new application of aligned images
bounds. We then extend the IBC converse proof to the counterpart overloaded
MISO-BC, obtained by enabling full transmitter cooperation. This, in turn, is
utilized to show that a multi-cell variant of the SLS scheme is optimal in the
mc-SLS regime under full multi-cell cooperation, albeit only for 2-cell
networks. The overwhelming combinatorial complexity of the GDoF region stands
in the way of extending this result to larger networks. Alternatively, we
appeal to extremal network analysis, recently introduced by Chan et al., and
study the GDoF gain of multi-cell cooperation over mc-TIN in the three regimes
of interest. We show that this extremal GDoF gain is bounded by small constants
in the mc-TIN and mc-CTIN regimes, yet scales logarithmically with the number
of cells in the mc-SLS regime.

indicator of various cardiovascular diseases. By measuring the displacement at
multiple parts of the human body, pulse wave velocity can be estimated from the
pulse transit time. This paper proposes a technique for signal separation using
an antenna array, so that pulse wave propagation can be measured in a
non-contact manner. The body displacements due to the pulse wave at different
body parts are highly correlated, and cannot be accurately separated using
techniques that assume independent or uncorrelated signals. The proposed method
formulates the signal separation as an optimization problem, based on a
mathematical model of the arterial pulse wave. The objective function in the
optimization comprises four terms that are derived based on a
small-displacement approximation, unimodal impulse response approximation, and
a causality condition. The optimization process was implemented using a genetic
algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through
numerical simulations and experiments.

magnetic fields of young stars, but also on alternate science goals like the
atmospheres of M dwarfs and the Earth's atmosphere. We finally conclude on the

attention from the research community over the years, yet remains largely
unsolved. Various optimization sequences exposed to the user are manually
designed by compiler developers. In designing such a sequence developers have
to choose the set of optimization passes, their parameters and ordering within
a sequence. Resulting sequences usually fall short of achieving optimal runtime
for a given source code and may sometimes even degrade the performance when
compared to unoptimized version. In this paper, we employ a deep reinforcement
learning approach to the phase-ordering problem. Provided with sub-sequences
constituting LLVM's O3 sequence, our agent learns to outperform the O3 sequence
on the set of source codes used for training and achieves competitive
performance on the validation set, gaining up to 1.32x speedup on
previously-unseen programs. Notably, our approach differs from autotuning
methods by not depending on one or more test runs of the program for making
successful optimization decisions. It has no dependence on any dynamic feature,
but only on the statically-attainable intermediate representation of the source
code. We believe that the models trained using our approach can be integrated
into modern compilers as neural optimization agents, at first to complement,
and eventually replace the hand-crafted optimization sequences.

found that for the stellar-to-halo mass models considered, the observed
satellite numbers tend to be on the lower end of the expected range. This could
either mean that there is an over-prediction of luminous subhalos in LambdaCDM

the $e p \to e p \gamma$ reaction. The article focuses on selected aspects of
the analysis. Method: The experiment extracted the $P_{LL} -P_{TT} / \epsilon$

gauge-charged matter that generates the gravitational field can be arbitrary,
as well as what equations are superimposed on the gauge field due to conditions
of compatibility of gravitational field equations. Considered problem is
analyzed from the point of view symmetry of the theory with respect to the
generalized gauge deformed groups without specification of Lagrangians.
  In particular it is shown, that the motion of uncharged particles along
geodesics of Riemannian space is inherent in an extremely wide range of
theories of gravity and is a consequence of the gauge translational invariance
of these theories under the condition of fulfilling equations of gravitational
field. In the cause of gauge-charged particles, the Lorentz force, generalized
for gauge-charged matter, appears in equations of motion as a consequence of
the gauge symmetry of the theory under the condition of fulfilling equations of
gravitational and gauge fields. In addition, we found relationships of
equations for some fields that follow from the assumption about fulfilling of
equations for other fields, for example, relationships of equations of the
gravitational field and the gauge field of internal symmetry which follow from
the assumption about fulfilling of equations of matter fields. In particular,
we obtained the identity that generalizes in the case of arbitrary gauge field
(and in the presence of gauge-charged matter) the identity found by Hilbert for
the electromagnetic field.
  At the end of the article there is an Appendix, which briefly describes the
main provisions and facts from the theory of generalized gauge deformed groups
and presents the main ideas of a single group-theoretical interpretation of
gauge fields of both external (space-time) and internal symmetry, which is an
alternative to their geometric interpretation.

characteristics of tip vortices shed from flexible rotor blades are
investigated numerically. An aeroelastic free-vortex wake method is employed to
simulate the helical tip vortices and the associated velocity field. A linear
eigenvalue stability analysis is employed to quantify stability trends (growth
rate v. perturbation wavenumber) and growth-rate temporal evolution of tip

vortex destabilization to low wavenumber perturbations, also blade-pitch
reduces growth-rate magnitude and alters the growth-rate peak dependence on
perturbation wavenumber, all of which have in the past not been reported in the

to the most fundamental models of particle physics, and as experimental control
on the quantum level increases there is a growing interest in non-equilibrium
effects such as dynamical quantum phase transitions. To demonstrate how these
physical theories can be accessed in near-term quantum devices, we study the
dynamics of a (1+1)D U(1) quantum link model following quenches of its
mass-term. We find that the system undergoes dynamical quantum phase
transitions for all system sizes considered, even the smallest where the
dynamics can be solved analytically. We devise a gauge invariant string order
parameter whose zeros correlates with the structure of the Loschmidt amplitude,
making the order parameter useful for experimental study in near-term devices.
The zeros of the Loschmidt amplitude as well as the zeros of our order
parameter are revealed by vortices in their phases, which can be counted by a
topologically invariant winding number. With noisy intermediate scale quantum
devices in mind, we propose a class of superconducting circuits for the general
implementation of U(1) quantum link models. The principles of these circuits
can be generalized to implement other, more complicated gauge symmetries.
Furthermore, the circuit can be modularly scaled to any lattice configuration.
Simulating the circuit dynamics with realistic circuit parameters we find that
it implements the target dynamics with a steady average fidelity of $ 99.5\% $
or higher. Finally, we consider readout of the circuit using a method that
yields information about all the degrees of freedom with resonators coupled
dispersively to only a subset of them. This constitutes a direct and relatively
straightforward protocol to access both Loschmidt amplitudes and the order

The discoid cockroach pushes its wings against the ground in an attempt to
dynamically self-right by a somersault. However, because this maneuver is
strenuous, the animal often fails to overcome the potential energy barrier and
makes continual attempts. In this process, the animal flails its legs, whose
lateral perturbation eventually leads it to roll to the side to self-right. Our
previous work developed a cockroach-inspired robot capable of leg-assisted,
winged self-righting, and a robot simulation study revealed that the outcome of
this strategy depends sensitively on wing-leg coordination (measured by the
phase between their motions). Here, we further elucidate why this is the case
by developing a template to model the complex hybrid dynamics resulting from
discontinuous contact and actuation. We used the template to calculate the
potential energy barrier that the body must overcome to self-right, mechanical
energy contribution by wing pushing and leg flailing, and mechanical energy
dissipation due to wing-ground collision. The template revealed that wing-leg
coordination (phase) strongly affects self-righting outcome by changing
mechanical energy budget. Well-coordinated appendage motions (good phase)
accumulate more mechanical energy than poorly-coordinated motions (bad phase),
thereby better overcoming the potential energy barrier to self-right more
successfully. Finally, we demonstrated practical use of the template for
predicting a new control strategy to further increase self-righting performance
and informing robot design.

from stochasticity of the environment or noise in organisms or devices

nuisance. For example, during dynamic walking, randomness in stochastic terrain
leads to metastable dynamics, which must be mitigated to stabilize the system
around limit cycles. Here, we studied whether randomness in motion is
beneficial for strenuous locomotor tasks. Our study used robotic simulation
modeling of strenuous, leg-assisted, winged ground self-righting observed in
cockroaches, in which unusually large randomness in wing and leg motions is
present. We developed a simplified simulation robot capable of generating
similar self-righting behavior and varied the randomness level in wing-leg
coordination. During each wing opening attempt, the more randomness added to
the time delay between wing opening and leg swinging, the more likely it was
for the naive robot (which did not know what coordination is best) to
self-right within a finite time. Wing-leg coordination, measured by the phase
between wing and leg oscillations, had a crucial impact on self-righting
outcome. Without randomness, periodic wing and leg oscillations often limited
the system to visit a few bad phases, leading to failure to escape from the
metastable state. With randomness, the system explored phases thoroughly and
had a better chance of encountering good phases to self-right. Our study
complements previous work by demonstrating that randomness helps destabilize
locomotor systems from being trapped in undesired metastable states, a
situation common in strenuous locomotion.

preferences. We devise an allocation mechanism, called the vigilant eating rule
(VER), that applies to nearly arbitrary feasibility constraints. It is
constrained ordinally efficient, can be computed efficiently for a large class
of constraints, and treats agents equally if they have the same preferences and
are subject to the same constraints. When the set of feasible allocations is
convex, we also present a characterization of our rule based on ordinal
egalitarianism. Our results about VER do not just apply to allocation problems
but to all collective choice problems in which agents have ordinal preferences
over discrete outcomes. As a case study, we assume objects have priorities for
agents and apply VER to sets of probabilistic allocations that are constrained
by stability. VER coincides with the (extended) probabilistic serial rule when
priorities are flat and the agent proposing deterministic deferred acceptance
algorithm when preferences and priorities are strict. While VER always returns
a stable and constrained efficient allocation, it fails to be strategyproof,
unconstrained efficient, and envy-free. We show, however, that each of these
three properties is incompatible with stability and constrained efficiency.

the property that every face has a unique sink. A number of well-studied
problems reduce in strongly polynomial time to finding the global sink of a
USO; most notably, linear programming (LP) and the P-matrix linear
complementarity problem (P-LCP). The former is not known to have a strongly
polynomial-time algorithm, while the latter is not known to even have a
polynomial-time algorithm, motivating the problem to find the global sink of a

problem such as LP, is exponentially small, relative to the class of all USOs.
Accordingly, geometric USOs exhibit additional properties that set them apart
from general USOs, and it may be advantageous, if not necessary, to leverage
these properties to find the global sink of a USO faster. Only a few such
properties are known. In this paper, we establish a new combinatorial property
of the USOs that arise from symmetric P-LCP, which includes the USOs that arise

(ii) ${\mathcal H}$ is the set of trees with bounded maximum degree and a

the instruments, we assume that the dynamics of the CME evolution is controlled
by aerodynamic drag, i.e., a force resulting from the interaction with
particles from the background solar wind. To model the drag force we use a
physical model that allows us to derive its parameters without the need to rely
on drag coefficients derived empirically. We found a CME ToA mean error of
$1.6\pm8.0$ hours ToA and a mean absolute error of $6.9\pm3.9$ hours for a set

levels of key disk turbulence parameters like the stress-to-pressure ratio

study on the VSI with focus on the disk density gradient $p$ and aspect ratio
$h := H/R$. We use full 2$\pi$ 3D simulations of the disk for chosen set of
both parameters. All simulations are evolved for 1000 reference orbits, at a
resolution of 18 cells per h. We find that the saturated stress-to-pressure
ratio in our simulations is dependent on the disk aspect ratio with a
\review{strong} scaling of $\alpha\propto h^{2.6}$, in contrast to the
traditional $\alpha$ model, where viscosity scales as $\nu \propto \alpha h^2$
with a constant $\alpha$. We also observe consistent formation of large scale
vortices across all investigated parameters. The vortices show uniformly aspect
ratios of $\chi \approx 10$ and radial widths of approximately 1.5 $H$. With
our findings we can reconcile the different values reported for the

specifically, the field where machine learning algorithms have found most
applications is Genetic Algorithms.The objective of this paper is to conduct a
survey of articles published from 2015 onwards that deal with Genetic
Algorithms(GA) and how they are used in bioinformatics.To achieve the
objective, a scoping review was conducted that utilized Google Scholar
alongside Publish or Perish and the Scimago Journal & CountryRank to search for
respectable sources. Upon analyzing 31 articles from the field of
bioinformatics, it became apparent that genetic algorithms rarely form a full
application, instead they rely on other vital algorithms such as support vector
machines.Indeed, support vector machines were the most prevalent algorithms
used alongside genetic algorithms; however, while the usage of such algorithms
contributes to the heavy focus on accuracy by GA programs, it often sidelines
computation times in the process. In fact, most applications employing GAs for
classification and feature selectionare nearing or at 100% success rate, and
the focus of future GA development should be directed elsewhere.
Population-based searches, like GA, are often combined with other machine
learning algorithms. In this scoping review, genetic algorithms combined with
Support Vector Machines were found to perform best. The performance metric that
was evaluated most often was accuracy. Measuring the accuracy avoids measuring
the main weakness of GAs, which is computational time. The future of genetic
algorithms could be open-ended evolutionary algorithms, which attempt to
increase complexity and find diverse solutions, rather than optimize a fitness
function and converge to a single best solution from the initial population of
solutions.

Things applications. In this paper, we study maximizing the network lifetime of
an energy-harvesting LoRa network. Such a network is characterized by
heterogeneous recharging capabilities across the nodes that is not taken into
account in existing work. We propose a link-layer protocol to achieve a
long-lived LoRa network which dynamically enables the nodes with depleting
batteries to exploit the superfluous energy of the neighboring nodes with
affluent batteries by letting a depleting node offload its packets to an
affluent node. By exploiting the LoRa's capability of adjusting multiple
transmission parameters, we enable low-cost offloading by depleting nodes
instead of high-cost direct forwarding. Such offloading requires
synchronization of wake-up times as well as transmission parameters between the
two nodes which also need to be selected dynamically. The proposed protocol
addresses these challenges and prolongs the lifetime of a LoRa network through
three novel techniques. (1) We propose a lightweight medium access control
protocol for peer-to-peer communication to enable packet offloading which
circumvents the synchronization overhead between the two nodes. (2) We propose
an intuitive heuristic method for effective parameter selections for different
modes (conventional vs. offloading). (3) We analyze the energy overhead of
offloading and, based on it, the protocol dynamically selects affluent and
depleting nodes while ensuring that an affluent node is not overwhelmed by the
depleting ones. Simulations in NS-3 as well as real experiments show that our
protocol can increase the network lifetime up to $4$ times while maintaining
the same throughput compared to traditional LoRa network.

structure to Jupiter's volcanic moon Io. A signature of spatially variable
tidal heating is generally sought in observations of surface heat fluxes or
volcanic activity, an exploration complicated by the transient nature of
volcanic events. The thickness of the lithosphere is expected to change over
much longer timescales, and so may provide a robust link between surface
observations and the tidal heating distribution. To predict long-wavelength
lithospheric thickness variations, we couple three-dimensional tidal heating
calculations to a suite of one-dimensional models of magmatic segregation and
volcanic eruption. We find that the lithospheric thickness could either be
correlated with the radially integrated heating rate, or weakly
anti-correlated. Lithospheric thickness is correlated with radially integrated
heating rate if magmatic intrusions form at a constant rate in the lithosphere,
but is weakly anti-correlated if intrusions form at a rate proportional to the
flux through volcanic conduits. Utilising a simple isostasy model we show how
variations in lithospheric thickness can predict long-wavelength topography.
The relationship between lithospheric thickness and topography depends on the
difference in chemical density between the lithosphere and mantle. Assuming
that this difference is small, we find that long-wavelength topography
anti-correlates with lithospheric thickness. These results will allow future
observations to critically evaluate models for Io's lithospheric structure, and
enable their use in constraining the distribution of tidal heating.

particular, the emergence of CPGE is not compatible with the D3h crystal
symmetry of two-dimensional TMDs, and should only be possible if the symmetry
of the electronic states is reduced by influences such as an external electric
field or mechanical strain. Schottky contacts, nearly ubiquitous in TMD-based
transistors, can provide the high electric fields causing a symmetry breaking
in the devices. Here, we investigate the effect of these Schottky contacts on
the CPC by characterizing the helicity-dependent photoresponse of monolayer
MoSe2 devices both with direct metal-MoSe2 Schottky contacts and with h-BN

driving. Concatenated continuous driving (CCD) techniques can, in principle,
mitigate this problem. Here we provide deeper insights into the dynamics under
CCD, based on Floquet theory, that lead to optimized state protection by
adjusting driving parameters in the CCD scheme to induce mode evolution
control. We experimentally demonstrate the improved control by simultaneously
addressing a dense Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) ensemble with $10^{10}$ spins. We
achieve an experimental 15-fold improvement in coherence time for an arbitrary,
unknown state, and a 500-fold improvement for an arbitrary, known state,
corresponding to driving the sidebands and the center band of the resulting
Mollow triplet, respectively. We can achieve such coherence time gains by
optimizing the driving parameters to take into account the noise affecting our

scenario, we identify the noise sources that dominate the decay mechanisms in
NV ensembles, confirm our model by experimental results, and identify the

RF/microwave circuits on SOI technology. Substrate losses is a key limiting
factor when designing inductors with high Q-factors. In this context, we report
a substrate engineering method that enables improvement of quality factors of
already fabricated inductors on SOI. A novel femtosecond laser milling process
is utilized for the fabrication of locally suspended membranes of inductors
with handler silicon completely etched. Such flexible membranes suspended
freely on the BOX show up to 92 % improvement in Q factor for single turn
inductor. The improvement in Q-factor is reported on large sized inductors due
to reduced parallel capacitance which allows enhanced operation of inductors at
high frequencies. A compact model extraction methodology has been developed to
model inductor membranes. These membranes have been utilized for the
improvement of noise performance of LNA working in the 4.9,5.9 GHz range. A 0.1
dB improvement in noise figure has been reported by taking an existing design
and suspending the input side inductors of the LNA circuit. The substrate
engineering method reported in this work is not only applicable to inductors

cluster model coupled to a number of effective conduction bands capturing its
essential low-energy physics. The major ingredient is the complex
single-particle self energy matrix of the uncorrelated problem that encodes the
influence to the host conduction band onto the dynamics of a set of correlated
orbitals. While the real part of the self-energy matrix generates an effective
hopping between the cluster orbitals, the imaginary part determines the
coupling to the effective conduction bands in the mapped model. The rank of the
imaginary part determines the number of independent screening channels of the
problem, and allows the replacement of the phenomenological exhaustion
criterion by a rigorous mathematical statement. This rank provides a
distinction between multi-impurity models of first kind and of second kind. For
the latter, there are insufficient screening channels available, so that a
singlet ground state must be driven by the inter-cluster spin correlations.
This classification provides a fundamental answer to the question of why
ferromagnetic correlations between local moments are irrelevant for the spin
compensated ground state in dilute impurity models, whereas they compete with
the Kondo-scale in dense impurity arrays, without evoking a spin density wave.

deduced from the analytic structure of the mapped model, demonstrating the
potential power of this approach. NRG calculations are presented for up to five

use of Maxwell regularization for the estimation of the sensitivity maps (SMs)

  Theory and Methods: Certain characteristics of both the SMs and the images
are routinely used to regularize the otherwise ill-posed optimization-based
joint reconstruction from highly accelerated PI data. In this paper we rely on
a fundamental property of SMs--they are solutions of Maxwell equations-- we
construct the subspace of all possible SM distributions supported in a given
field-of-view, and we promote solutions of SMs that belong in this subspace. In
addition, we propose a constrained optimization scheme for the image
reconstruction, as a second step, once an accurate estimation of the SMs is
available. The resulting method, dubbed Maxwell Parallel Imaging (MPI), works
seamlessly for arbitrary sequences (both 2D and 3D) with any trajectory and
minimal calibration signals.
  Results: The effectiveness of MPI is illustrated for a wide range of datasets
with various undersampling schemes, including radial, variable-density
Poisson-disc, and Cartesian, and is compared against the state-of-the-art PI
methods. Finally, we include some numerical experiments that demonstrate the
memory footprint reduction of the constructed Maxwell basis with the help of
tensor decomposition, thus allowing the use of MPI for full 3D image

  Conclusions: The MPI framework provides a physics-inspired optimization
method for the accurate and efficient image reconstruction from arbitrary

borrowing and withdrawal of allowances) linking the trading periods. The
results are based on the analysis of a forward-backward stochastic differential
equation with coupled forward and backward components, a discontinuous terminal

systems (SCSs) remains a hard problem. Diverse evidence needs to be combined in
a rigorous way: in particular, results of operational testing with other
evidence from design and verification. Growing use of machine learning in SCSs,
by precluding most established methods for gaining assurance, makes operational
testing even more important for supporting safety and reliability claims.
Objective: We use Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) as a current example to revisit the
problem of demonstrating high reliability. AVs are making their debut on public
roads: methods for assessing whether an AV is safe enough are urgently needed.
We demonstrate how to answer 5 questions that would arise in assessing an AV
type, starting with those proposed by a highly-cited study. Method: We apply
new theorems extending Conservative Bayesian Inference (CBI), which exploit the
rigour of Bayesian methods while reducing the risk of involuntary misuse
associated with now-common applications of Bayesian inference; we define
additional conditions needed for applying these methods to AVs. Results: Prior
knowledge can bring substantial advantages if the AV design allows strong
expectations of safety before road testing. We also show how naive attempts at
conservative assessment may lead to over-optimism instead; why extrapolating
the trend of disengagements is not suitable for safety claims; use of knowledge
that an AV has moved to a less stressful environment. Conclusion: While some
reliability targets will remain too high to be practically verifiable, CBI
removes a major source of doubt: it allows use of prior knowledge without
inducing dangerously optimistic biases. For certain ranges of required
reliability and prior beliefs, CBI thus supports feasible, sound arguments.
Useful conservative claims can be derived from limited prior knowledge.

research areas. The fundamental idea behind the design of most neural networks
is to learn similarity patterns from data for prediction and inference, which
lacks the ability of cognitive reasoning. However, the concrete ability of
reasoning is critical to many theoretical and practical problems. On the other
hand, traditional symbolic reasoning methods do well in making logical
inference, but they are mostly hard rule-based reasoning, which limits their
generalization ability to different tasks since difference tasks may require
different rules. Both reasoning and generalization ability are important for
prediction tasks such as recommender systems, where reasoning provides strong
connection between user history and target items for accurate prediction, and
generalization helps the model to draw a robust user portrait over noisy
inputs.
  In this paper, we propose Logic-Integrated Neural Network (LINN) to integrate
the power of deep learning and logic reasoning. LINN is a dynamic neural
architecture that builds the computational graph according to input logical
expressions. It learns basic logical operations such as AND, OR, NOT as neural
modules, and conducts propositional logical reasoning through the network for
inference. Experiments on theoretical task show that LINN achieves significant
performance on solving logical equations and variables. Furthermore, we test
our approach on the practical task of recommendation by formulating the task
into a logical inference problem. Experiments show that LINN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art recommendation models in Top-K recommendation,

move off to infinity. The escape speed is a function of the distance from the
center of the turntable and for a given distance from the center, it depends on
the direction of initial velocity. A qualitative explanation of this behavior
is given in terms of the fictitious forces. Numerical study also indicates an
alternative way for measuring the coefficient of friction between the particle

coefficients of infection rate, incubation rate, recovery rate. The

the effectiveness of the methods of treatment of the infected people in the

The sharp rise and decline of SN Ia light curves make them promising for
measuring time delays, but microlensing can distort these light curves and
therefore add large uncertainties to the measurements. An alternative approach
is to use color curves where uncertainties due to microlensing are
significantly reduced for a certain period of time known as the achromatic
phase. In this work, we investigate in detail the achromatic phase, testing
four different SN Ia models with various microlensing configurations. We find
on average an achromatic phase of around three rest-frame weeks or longer for
most color curves but the spread in the duration of the achromatic phase (due
to different microlensing maps and filter combinations) is quite large and an
achromatic phase of just a few days is also possible. Furthermore, the
achromatic phase is longer for smoother microlensing maps, lower
macro-magnifications and larger mean Einstein radii of microlenses. From our
investigations, we do not find a strong dependency on the model or on
asymmetries in the SN ejecta. Further, we find that three independent LSST
color curves exhibit features such as extreme points or turning points within
the achromatic phase, which make them promising for time-delay measurements.
These curves contain combinations of rest-frame bands $u$, $g$, $r$, and $i$
and to observe them for typical LSN Ia redshifts, it would be ideal to cover

$n\times n$ array of $k$-subsets (called blocks) of an $nk$-set (of
treatments), such that each treatment occurs once in each row and once in each
column of the array. A semi-Latin square is uniform if every pair of blocks,
not in the same row or column, intersect in the same positive number of
treatments. We show that when a uniform $(n\times n)/k$ semi-Latin square
exists, the Schur optimal $(n\times n)/k$ semi-Latin squares are precisely the
uniform ones. We then compare uniform semi-Latin squares using the criterion of
pairwise-variance (PV) aberration, introduced by J.P. Morgan for affine
resolvable designs, and determine the uniform $(n\times n)/k$ semi-Latin
squares with minimum PV aberration when there exist $n-1$ mutually orthogonal
Latin squares (MOLS) of order $n$. These do not exist when $n=6$, and the
smallest uniform semi-Latin squares in this case have size $(6\times 6)/10$. We
present a complete classification of the uniform $(6\times 6)/10$ semi-Latin
squares, and display the one with least PV aberration. We give a construction
producing a uniform $((n+1)\times (n+1))/((n-2)n)$ semi-Latin square when there
exist $n-1$ MOLS of order $n$, and determine the PV aberration of such a
uniform semi-Latin square. Finally, we describe how certain affine resolvable
designs and balanced incomplete-block designs (BIBDs) can be constructed from
uniform semi-Latin squares. From the uniform $(6\times 6)/10$ semi-Latin
squares we classified, we obtain (up to block design isomorphism) exactly 16875
affine resolvable designs for 72 treatments in 36 blocks of size 12 and 8615
BIBDs for 36 treatments in 84 blocks of size 6. In particular, this shows that
there are at least 16875 pairwise non-isomorphic orthogonal arrays
$\mathrm{OA}(72,6,6,2)$.

  COVID-19",,,,,"q-bio.OT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The first cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were reported in
December 2019 and the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic in March
2020 by the World Health Organization. This sparked a plethora of
investigations into diagnostics and vaccination for SARS-CoV-2, as well as
treatments for COVID-19. Since COVID-19 is a severe disease associated with a
high mortality, clinical trials in this disease should be monitored by a data
monitoring committee (DMC), also known as data safety monitoring board (DSMB).
DMCs in this indication face a number of challenges including fast recruitment
requiring an unusually high frequency of safety reviews, more frequent use of
complex designs and virtually no prior experience with the disease. In this
paper, we provide a perspective on the work of DMCs for clinical trials of
treatments for COVID-19. More specifically, we discuss organizational aspects
of setting up and running DMCs for COVID-19 trials, in particular for trials
with more complex designs such as platform trials or adaptive designs.
Furthermore, statistical aspects of monitoring clinical trials of treatments
for COVID-19 are considered. Some recommendations are made regarding the
presentation of the data, stopping rules for safety monitoring and the use of
external data. The proposed stopping boundaries are assessed in a simulation
study motivated by clinical trials in COVID-19.

amid COVID-19 pandemic and call for research on aerosol generated during dental
procedures. Thus, this study aims to assess the mechanisms of dental aerosol
dispersion in dental offices and to provide recommendations based on a
quantitative study to minimize infection transmission in dental offices. The
spread and removal of aerosol particles generated from dental procedures in a
dental office are measured near the source and at the corner of the office. We
studied the effects of air purification (on/off), door condition (open/close),
and particle sizes on the temporal concentration distribution of particles. The
results show that in the worst-scenario scenario it takes 95 min for 0.5 um
particles to settle, and that it takes a shorter time for the larger particles.
The indoor air purifier tested expedited the removal time at least 6.3 times
faster than the scenario air purifier off. Airborne particles may be
transported from the source to the rest of the room, even when the particle
concentrations in the generation zone return to the background level. These
results are expected to be valuable to related policy making and technology
development for infection disease control in dental offices and similar built
environments.

systems. However, the sparse and large feature space requires exhaustive search
to identify effective crosses. Deep & Cross Network (DCN) was proposed to
automatically and efficiently learn bounded-degree predictive feature
interactions. Unfortunately, in models that serve web-scale traffic with
billions of training examples, DCN showed limited expressiveness in its cross
network at learning more predictive feature interactions. Despite significant
research progress made, many deep learning models in production still rely on
traditional feed-forward neural networks to learn feature crosses
inefficiently.
  In light of the pros/cons of DCN and existing feature interaction learning
approaches, we propose an improved framework DCN-V2 to make DCN more practical
in large-scale industrial settings. In a comprehensive experimental study with
extensive hyper-parameter search and model tuning, we observed that DCN-V2
approaches outperform all the state-of-the-art algorithms on popular benchmark
datasets. The improved DCN-V2 is more expressive yet remains cost efficient at
feature interaction learning, especially when coupled with a mixture of
low-rank architecture. DCN-V2 is simple, can be easily adopted as building
blocks, and has delivered significant offline accuracy and online business
metrics gains across many web-scale learning to rank systems at Google.

models (LMs) is a long-standing research problem for automatic speech
recognition (ASR). A cross-utterance LM (CULM) is proposed in this paper, which
augments the input to a standard long short-term memory (LSTM) LM with a
context vector derived from past and future utterances using an extraction
network. The extraction network uses another LSTM to encode surrounding
utterances into vectors which are integrated into a context vector using either
a projection of LSTM final hidden states, or a multi-head self-attentive layer.
In addition, an acoustic error sampling technique is proposed to reduce the
mismatch between training and test-time. This is achieved by considering
possible ASR errors into the model training procedure, and can therefore
improve the word error rate (WER). Experiments performed on both AMI and
Switchboard datasets show that CULMs outperform the LSTM LM baseline WER. In
particular, the CULM with a self-attentive layer-based extraction network and
acoustic error sampling achieves 0.6% absolute WER reduction on AMI, 0.3% WER
reduction on the Switchboard part and 0.9% WER reduction on the Callhome part
of Eval2000 test set over the respective baselines.

formulated problem and the sensitive delay requirements of vehicular
applications, we transform the optimization problem using reinforcement
learning and then design a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based
solution. Through training the DDPG-based resource management model offline,
optimal vehicle association and resource allocation decisions can be obtained
rapidly. Simulation results demonstrate that the DDPG-based resource management
scheme can converge within 200 episodes and achieve higher
