  Recovery from a 2D Human Pose","Accepted to ECCV 2020, 22 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  Most of the recent deep learning-based 3D human pose and mesh estimation
methods regress the pose and shape parameters of human mesh models, such as
SMPL and MANO, from an input image. The first weakness of these methods is an
appearance domain gap problem, due to different image appearance between train
data from controlled environments, such as a laboratory, and test data from
in-the-wild environments. The second weakness is that the estimation of the
pose parameters is quite challenging owing to the representation issues of 3D
rotations. To overcome the above weaknesses, we propose Pose2Mesh, a novel
graph convolutional neural network (GraphCNN)-based system that estimates the
3D coordinates of human mesh vertices directly from the 2D human pose. The 2D
human pose as input provides essential human body articulation information,
while having a relatively homogeneous geometric property between the two
domains. Also, the proposed system avoids the representation issues, while
fully exploiting the mesh topology using a GraphCNN in a coarse-to-fine manner.
We show that our Pose2Mesh outperforms the previous 3D human pose and mesh
estimation methods on various benchmark datasets. For the codes, see

computation of tasks due to benefits such as high reliability, scalability,
computation speed, and costeffectiveness. However, distributed computing faces
critical issues related to communication load and straggler effects. In
particular, computing nodes need to exchange intermediate results with each
other in order to calculate the final result, and this significantly increases
communication overheads. Furthermore, a distributed computing network may
include straggling nodes that run intermittently slower. This results in a
longer overall time needed to execute the computation tasks, thereby limiting
the performance of distributed computing. To address these issues, coded
distributed computing (CDC), i.e., a combination of coding theoretic techniques
and distributed computing, has been recently proposed as a promising solution.
Coding theoretic techniques have proved effective in WiFi and cellular systems
to deal with channel noise. Therefore, CDC may significantly reduce
communication load, alleviate the effects of stragglers, provide
fault-tolerance, privacy and security. In this survey, we first introduce the
fundamentals of CDC, followed by basic CDC schemes. Then, we review and analyze
a number of CDC approaches proposed to reduce the communication costs, mitigate
the straggler effects, and guarantee privacy and security. Furthermore, we
present and discuss applications of CDC in modern computer networks. Finally,
we highlight important challenges and promising research directions related to
CDC

three representation injection techniques for transformer-based models and
three accompanying methods which map sentences to and from this representation

from a variety of genres. More importantly, without needing complex
optimization algorithms, our methods recover these sentences almost perfectly
without fine-tuning the underlying language model at all.

is invariant under the full set of local conformal transformations, including
inversions, as well as possessing conservation laws that provide a natural
local generalisation of those satisfied by field theories with global conformal
invariance, and also having an `ungauged' limit that corresponds to global
conformal transformations. By contrast, although standard Weyl gauge theory
also enjoys the first of these properties, it does not share the other two, and
so cannot be considered a valid gauge theory of the conformal group.

continuous film on a silicon wafer with a 3-dimensional pattern. After removing
the silicon, a corrugated membrane with enhanced mechanical properties was
formed. Mechanical materials, such as this corrugated membrane, are engineered
to improve its strength and robustness, which allows it to span a larger
surface in comparison to flat membranes while the film thickness remains
constant. The ultra-thin film consists of three layers (Al$_2$O$_3$
/TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$) and is deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD). The
encapsulated TiN layer provides in-plane conductivity, which is needed to
sustain secondary electron emission. Two types of corrugated membranes were
fabricated: a hexagonal honeycomb and an octagonal pattern. The latter was
designed to match the square pitch of a CMOS pixel chip. The transmission
secondary electron yield was determined with a collector-based method using a
scanning electron microscope. The highest transmission electron yield was
measured on a membrane with an octagonal pattern. A yield of 2.15 was achieved
for 3.15 keV incident electrons for an Al$_2$O$_3$ /TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$ tri-layer
film with layer thicknesses of 10/5/15 nm. The variation in yield across the
surface of the corrugated membrane was determined by constructing a yield map.
The active surface for transmission secondary electron emission is near 100%,
i.e. a primary electron generates transmission secondary electrons regardless
of the point of impact on the corrugated membrane.

We identify the signatures of memory and explain their origin. The emerging

the motion of a tagged-particle. We are interested in the ""confining"" (all
background particles in front of the tagged-particle) and ""pushing"" (all

a popular approach in information retrieval. Because click data is often noisy

learning to rank (ULTR) algorithms for the learning of unbiased ranking models.
Among them, automatic unbiased learning to rank (AutoULTR) algorithms that
jointly learn user bias models (i.e., propensity models) with unbiased rankers
have received a lot of attention due to their superior performance and low
deployment cost in practice. Despite their differences in theories and
algorithm design, existing studies on ULTR usually use uni-variate ranking
functions to score each document or result independently. On the other hand,
recent advances in context-aware learning-to-rank models have shown that
multivariate scoring functions, which read multiple documents together and
predict their ranking scores jointly, are more powerful than uni-variate
ranking functions in ranking tasks with human-annotated relevance labels.
Whether such superior performance would hold in ULTR with noisy data, however,
is mostly unknown. In this paper, we investigate existing multivariate scoring
functions and AutoULTR algorithms in theory and prove that permutation
invariance is a crucial factor that determines whether a context-aware
learning-to-rank model could be applied to existing AutoULTR framework. Our
experiments with synthetic clicks on two large-scale benchmark datasets show
that AutoULTR models with permutation-invariant multivariate scoring functions
significantly outperform those with uni-variate scoring functions and
permutation-variant multivariate scoring functions.

approaches reconstruct full expressive 3D humans from images using 3D body
models that include the face and hands. These methods are optimization-based
and thus slow, prone to local optima, and require 2D keypoints as input. We
address these limitations by introducing ExPose (EXpressive POse and Shape
rEgression), which directly regresses the body, face, and hands, in SMPL-X
format, from an RGB image. This is a hard problem due to the high
dimensionality of the body and the lack of expressive training data.
Additionally, hands and faces are much smaller than the body, occupying very
few image pixels. This makes hand and face estimation hard when body images are
downscaled for neural networks. We make three main contributions. First, we
account for the lack of training data by curating a dataset of SMPL-X fits on
in-the-wild images. Second, we observe that body estimation localizes the face
and hands reasonably well. We introduce body-driven attention for face and hand
regions in the original image to extract higher-resolution crops that are fed
to dedicated refinement modules. Third, these modules exploit part-specific
knowledge from existing face- and hand-only datasets. ExPose estimates
expressive 3D humans more accurately than existing optimization methods at a

the presence of voids in an explosive has long been known to induce so-called
hot spots that greatly accelerate the global reaction rate, the ability to
computationally resolve the details of the interaction of the shock front with
heterogeneities existing on the scale of the detonation reaction zone has only
recently become feasible. In this study, the influence of the spatial
distribution of air-filled cavities has been examined, enabled by the use of
graphic processing unit (GPU) accelerated computations that can resolve shock
initiation and detonation propagation through an explosive while fully
resolving features at the mesoscale. Different spatial distributions of
cavities are examined in two-dimensional simulations, including regular arrays
of cavities, slightly perturbed arrays, random arrays (with varying minimum
spacing being imposed on the cavities), and randomly distributed clusters of
cavities. The presence of the cavities is able to reduce the time required to
initiate detonation---for a given input shock strength---by greater than 50%,
in agreement with previous experimental results. Randomly distributing the
cavities results in a 15-20% decrease in detonation initiation time in
comparison to a regular array of cavities. Clustering the cavities---as would
occur in the case of agglomeration---results in an additional 10% decrease in
detonation initiation time in comparison to random arrays. The effect of
clustering is shown not to be a result of the clusters forming an effectively
larger cavity, but rather due to interactions between clusters upon shock
loading occurring on the microscale.

DNNs, such as the importance of different neurons and features. The concepts
from explainable AI provide an opportunity to improve DNN compression methods
such as quantization and pruning in several ways that have not been
sufficiently explored so far. In this paper, we utilize explainable AI methods:
mainly DeepLIFT method. We use these methods for (1) pruning of DNNs; this
includes structured and unstructured pruning of \ac{CNN} filters pruning as
well as pruning weights of fully connected layers, (2) non-uniform quantization
of DNN weights using clustering algorithm; this is also referred to as Weight

layer of a DNN may use a different number of integer bits. We use typical image
classification datasets with common deep learning image classification models

improvements as well as new insights and opportunities from the use of

simultaneously detect changes in multiple channels. This ""local"" approach is

we systematically study the utility of incorporating dependency trees into
pre-trained transformers on three representative information extraction tasks:
semantic role labeling (SRL), named entity recognition, and relation
extraction.
  We propose and investigate two distinct strategies for incorporating
dependency structure: a late fusion approach, which applies a graph neural
network on the output of a transformer, and a joint fusion approach, which
infuses syntax structure into the transformer attention layers. These
strategies are representative of prior work, but we introduce additional model
design elements that are necessary for obtaining improved performance. Our
empirical analysis demonstrates that these syntax-infused transformers obtain
state-of-the-art results on SRL and relation extraction tasks. However, our
analysis also reveals a critical shortcoming of these models: we find that
their performance gains are highly contingent on the availability of

permuton and we show that it is the scaling limit (in the permuton sense) of
uniform Baxter permutations. In addition, we relate the limiting objects of the
four families to each other, both in the local and scaling limit case.
  The scaling limit result is based on the convergence of the trajectories of
the coalescent-walk process to the coalescing flow -- in the terminology of Le
Jan and Raimond (2004) -- of a perturbed version of the Tanaka stochastic
differential equation. Our scaling result entails joint convergence of the
tandem walks of a plane bipolar orientation and its dual, extending the main
result of Gwynne, Holden, Sun (2016), and giving an alternative answer to
Conjecture 4.4 of Kenyon, Miller, Sheffield, Wilson (2019) compared to the one
of Gwynne, Holden, Sun (2016).

extracts pose-invariant correspondences between raw point clouds and Gaussian

recover the optimal transformation from matched GMM parameters. This
construction allows the network learn an SE(3)-invariant feature space,
producing a global registration method that is real-time, generalizable, and

we apply a Deep Learning (DL) approach using an input of CM simulations of the

paper deals with the specific case where particles are approximately spherical
(i.e. Wicksell's problem). The paper presents a novel approximation of the

uses the actual non-smoothness of mineral particles rather than perfect
spheres. The new approximation facilitates the numerically efficient use of the
maximum likelihood method, a generally powerful method that provides the
distribution parameter estimates of the minimal variance in most practical
cases. The variance and bias of the estimates by the maximum likelihood method
were compared numerically for several typical particle-size distributions with
those by alternative parametric methods (method of moments and minimum distance
estimation), and the maximum likelihood estimation was found to be preferable
for both small and large samples. The maximum likelihood method, along with the
suggested approximation, may also be used for selecting a model, for
constructing narrow confidence intervals for distribution parameters using all
the profiles without random sampling and for including the measurements of the
profiles intersected by section boundaries. The utility of the approach is
illustrated using an example from glacier ice petrography.

realistic and diverse scenes, a number of parameters governing the procedural
models have to be carefully tuned by experts. These parameters control both the
structure of scenes being generated (e.g. how many cars in the scene), as well
as parameters which place objects in valid configurations. Meta-Sim aimed at
automatically tuning parameters given a target collection of real images in an
unsupervised way. In Meta-Sim2, we aim to learn the scene structure in addition
to parameters, which is a challenging problem due to its discrete nature.
Meta-Sim2 proceeds by learning to sequentially sample rule expansions from a
given probabilistic scene grammar. Due to the discrete nature of the problem,
we use Reinforcement Learning to train our model, and design a feature space
divergence between our synthesized and target images that is key to successful
training. Experiments on a real driving dataset show that, without any

producing geometrically consistent novel views that preserve semantic

representation of the scene in feature space, thereby preserving the semantic
labels of 3D geometric structures. We then project the layered features onto
the target views to generate the final novel-view images. We verify the

has become a pandemic outbreak with more than 24 million confirmed infections
and above 840 thousand deaths worldwide. In this study, we consider a
mathematical model on COVID-19 transmission with the prosocial awareness
effect. The proposed model can have four equilibrium states based on different
parametric conditions. The local and global stability conditions for awareness
free, disease-free equilibrium is studied. Using Lyapunov function theory and
LaSalle Invariance Principle, the disease-free equilibrium is shown globally
asymptotically stable under some parametric constraints. The existence of
unique awareness free, endemic equilibrium and unique endemic equilibrium is
presented. We calibrate our proposed model parameters to fit daily cases and
deaths from Colombia. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the transmission rate
and learning factor related to awareness of susceptibles are very crucial for
reduction in disease related deaths. Finally, we assess the impact of prosocial
awareness during the outbreak and compare this strategy with popular control
measures. Results indicate that prosocial awareness has competitive potential
to flatten the curve.

series data in many areas, such as mathematical finance, physics, and biology.
They provide a mechanistic description of the phenomeon of interest, and their
parameters often have a clear interpretation. These advantages come at the cost
of requiring a relatively simple model specification. We propose a flexible
model for SDEs with time-varying dynamics where the parameters of the process
are non-parametric functions of covariates, similar to generalized additive
models. Combining the SDEs and non-parametric approaches allows for the SDE to
capture more detailed, non-stationary, features of the data-generating process.
We present a computationally efficient method of approximate inference, where
the SDE parameters can vary according to fixed covariate effects, random

utility of this approach with three applications in ecology, where there is
often a modelling trade-off between interpretability and flexibility.

perturbative instability of localization at finite energy densities once
interactions are added, i.e. evidence for the relevance of interactions - in a
renormalization group sense - to the non-interacting critical point governed by
infinite randomness scaling. We introduce a novel diagnostic, the
""susceptibility of entanglement"", which allows us to perturbatively probe the
effect of adding interactions on the entanglement properties of eigenstates,
and helps us elucidate the resonant processes that can cause thermalization.
The susceptibility serves as a much more sensitive probe, and its divergence
can detect the perturbative beginnings of an incipient instability even in

localization. We expect this new measure to be of independent interest for
analyzing the stability of localization in a variety of different settings.

to understand non-perturbative aspects of quantum field theories in four and
lower dimensions. In this paper we focus on 1-form symmetries of weakly coupled
6d supersymmetric gauge theories coupled to dynamical tensor multiplets. We
study the consistency of global 1-form symmetries corresponding to the center
of the gauge groups, or subgroups thereof, by activating their background
fields, which makes the instanton density fractional. In 6d, an instanton
background for a given gauge theory sources BPS strings via tadpole
cancellation. The non-trivial 1-form symmetry background configurations
contribute to the charge of the BPS strings. However, Dirac quantization
imposes restrictions on the consistent 1-form backgrounds, since they can in
general lead to and induce fractional charges, thus making (part of) the
putative higher-form symmetry inconsistent. This gives explicit criteria to
determine whether the discrete 1-form symmetries are realized. We implement
these criteria in concrete examples originating from string compactifications.
We also corroborate this by finding that a non-trivial fractional contribution
is related to states which explicitly break the global 1-form symmetry
appearing as massive excitations of the 6d BPS strings. For 6d theories
consistently coupled to gravity, this hints at a symmetry breaking tower of
states. When the fractional contributions are absent, the F-theory realization
of the theories points to the gauging of the 1-form symmetry via the presence
of non-trivial Mordell--Weil torsion.

  and destruction and the impact of magnetic fields","Accepted for publication in MNRAS",,"10.1093/mnras/staa3177",,"astro-ph.GA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Multiphase galaxy winds, the accretion of cold gas through galaxy haloes, and
gas stripping from jellyfish galaxies are examples of interactions between cold
and hot gaseous phases. There are two important regimes in such systems. A
sufficiently small cold cloud is destroyed by the hot wind as a result of
Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities, which shatter the cloud into small pieces that
eventually mix and dissolve in the hot wind. On the contrary, stripped cold gas
from a large cloud mixes with the hot wind to intermediate temperatures, and
then becomes thermally unstable and cools, causing a net accretion of hot gas
to the cold tail. Using the magneto-hydrodynamical code AREPO, we perform cloud
crushing simulations and test analytical criteria for the transition between
the growth and destruction regimes to clarify a current debate in the
literature. We find that the hot-wind cooling time sets the transition radius
and not the cooling time of the mixed phase. Magnetic fields modify the
wind-cloud interaction. Draping of wind magnetic field enhances the field
upstream of the cloud and fluid instabilities are suppressed by a turbulently
magnetised wind beyond what is seen for a wind with a uniform magnetic field.
We furthermore predict jellyfish galaxies to have ordered magnetic fields
aligned with their tails. We finally discuss how the results of idealised
simulations can be used to provide input to subgrid models in cosmological
(magneto-)hydrodynamical simulations, which cannot resolve the detailed
small-scale structure of cold gas clouds in the circum-galactic medium.

black holes (BHs) with $\sim 10^{5}~M_{\odot}$ in the early universe. To study
a long-term accretion growth of a DCBH thus formed, we perform cosmological
radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, extending our previous work where we
investigated its formation stage. With a high spatial resolution down below the
Bondi radius, we show that the accretion rate onto the BH is far below the
Eddington value. Such slow mass growth is partly because of the strong
radiative feedback from the accreting BH. Moreover, we find that the BH has a
large velocity of $\sim 100~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ relative to the gas after it falls
into the first galaxy, which substantially reduces the accretion rate. The
latter effect stems from the fact that the DCBHs form in metal-free
environments typically at $\sim 1~$kpc from the galaxy. The BH accelerates as
it approaches the galactic center due to the gravity. The relative velocity
never damps after that, and the BH does not settle down to the galactic center
but continues to wander around it. An analytic estimate predicts that the DCBH
formation within $\sim 100$~pc around the galactic center is necessary to
decelerate the BH with dynamical friction before $z=7$. Since metal enrichment
with $Z \sim 10^{-5} - 10^{-3}~Z_\odot$ is expected in such a case, the
formation of DCBHs in the metal-poor environments is preferable for the
subsequent rapid growth.

the trends observed in the local Universe as a function of galaxy star
formation rate and different gas-mass phases. We show that the cold gas content
(whose largest fraction is represented by the atomic gas phase) can be
considered as the third parameter governing the scatter of the predicted
mass-metallicity relation, in agreement with the most recent observational
measurements. The trends can be explained with fluctuations of the gas
accretion rates: a decrease of the gas supply leads to an increase of the gas
metallicity due to star formation, while an increase of the available cold gas
leads to a metallicity depletion. We demonstrate that the former process is
responsible for offsets above the mass-metallicity relation, while the latter
is responsible for deviations below the mass-metallicity relation. In low and
intermediate mass galaxies, these negative offsets are primarily determined by
late gas cooling dominated by material that has been previously ejected due to
stellar feedback.

for the development of quantum technology. Here we apply Differentiable
Programming (DP) and Natural Evolution Strategies (NES) to the optimal
transport of Majorana zero modes in superconducting nanowires, a key element to
the success of Majorana-based topological quantum computation. We formulate the
motion control of Majorana zero modes as an optimization problem for which we
propose a new categorization of four different regimes with respect to the
critical velocity of the system and the total transport time. In addition to
correctly recovering the anticipated smooth protocols in the adiabatic regime,
our algorithms uncover efficient but strikingly counter-intuitive motion
strategies in the non-adiabatic regime. The emergent picture reveals a simple
but high fidelity strategy that makes use of pulse-like jumps at the beginning
and the end of the protocol with a period of constant velocity in between the
jumps, which we dub the jump-move-jump protocol. We provide a transparent
semi-analytical picture, which uses the sudden approximation and a
reformulation of the Majorana motion in a moving frame, to illuminate the key
characteristics of the jump-move-jump control strategy. We verify that the
jump-move-jump protocol remains robust against the presence of interactions or
disorder, and corroborate its high efficacy on a realistic proximity coupled
nanowire model. Our results demonstrate that machine learning for quantum
control can be applied efficiently to quantum many-body dynamical systems with
performance levels that make it relevant to the realization of large-scale
quantum technology.

are Fock quantized. The three loop cosmological models under consideration are
the standard LQC, the modified LQC-I (mLQC-I) and the modified LQC-II (mLQC-II)
in the spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) universe
with a Starobinsky potential. These models arise from different regularizations
of the classical Hamiltonian constraint in the symmetry reduced spacetimes and
aim to capture certain features of quantization in loop quantum gravity. When
applying the techniques in the hybrid approach to mLQC-I/II, we find the
effective Mukhanov-Sasaki equations take the same form as in LQC. The
difference among the three models is encoded in the unique expressions of the
effective masses in each model. We find that the relative difference in the
amplitude of power spectrum between LQC and mLQC-II is approximately $50\%$ in
the infrared and the oscillatory regimes, whereas this difference can be as
large as $100\%$ between mLQC-I and LQC/mLQC-II. Interestingly, in the infrared
and the oscillatory regimes of mLQC-I, we obtain a suppressed power spectrum
from the hybrid approach which is far below the Planck scale. This result is in
a striking contrast to the one obtained from dressed metric approach to
perturbations where the corresponding amplitude in this regime is extremely
large. Our analysis shows that while the phenomenological predictions are in
agreement between two approaches for LQC and mLQC-II, for mLQC-I the
differences between dressed and hybrid approaches can be quite significant. Our
result provides the first robust evidence of difference in predictions between
dressed and hybrid approaches due to respective underlying constructions.

could be detected in the future. A first-order phase transition at the
electroweak scale is a prediction of many theories beyond the Standard Model,
and is also motivated as an ingredient of some theories attempting to provide
an explanation for the matter-antimatter asymmetry in our Universe.
  Starting from bosonic and fermionic statistics, we derive Boltzmann's
equation and generalise to a fluid of particles with field dependent mass. We
introduce the thermal effective potential for the field in its lowest order
approximation, discuss the transition to the Higgs phase in the Standard Model
and beyond, and compute the probability for the field to cross a potential
barrier. After these preliminaries, we provide a hydrodynamical description of
first-order phase transitions as it is appropriate for describing the early
Universe. We thereby discuss the key quantities characterising a phase
transition, and how they are imprinted in the gravitational wave power spectrum
that might be detectable by the space-based gravitational wave detector LISA in
the 2030s.

the nature of the progenitor star. In this paper X-ray observations of five of
the oldest known X-ray supernovae - SN 1970G, SN 1968D, SN 1959D, SN 1957D and
SN 1941C - are analyzed, with the aim of reconstructing their light curves over
several decades. For those supernovae for which we can extract multi-epoch
data, the X-ray luminosity appears to decline with time, although with large
error bars. No increase in the X-ray emission from SN 1970G is found at later
epochs, contrary to previous reports. All five SNe show X-ray luminosities that
are of comparable magnitude. We compare the late-time X-ray luminosities of
these SNe to those of supernova remnants (SNRs) in the Galaxy which are a few
hundred years old, and find that when the tentative decline is taken into
account, the luminosity of the old SNe studied herein could fall below the
luminosity of some of the younger SNRs within a few hundred years. However, the
X-ray luminosity should begin to increase as the SNe expand in the Sedov phase,
thus reaching that of the observed SNRs.

carrier density, which is known to drastically change the interaction between
the localized Eu moments and the conduction electrons. One of early triumphs of
the quantum theory in condensed matter was the presence of Fermi surface, which
is intimately linked to the symmetry of the underlying crystal lattice. This
symmetry can be probed by angle resolved magnetoresistance (AMRO) measurements.
Here, we present angle resolved magnetoresistance (AMRO) measurements that show
a that in EuB6 this symmetry is broken, possibly indicating the presence of a
quantum nematic phase. We identify the region in the temperature-magnetic field
phase diagram where the magnetoresistance shows two-fold oscillations instead
of the expected fourfold pattern. Quantum nematic phases are analogous to
classical liquid crystals. Like liquid crystals, which break the rotational
symmetry of space, their quantum analogs break the point-group symmetry of the
crystal due to strong electron-electron interactions, as in quantum Hall
states, Sr3Ru2O7, and high temperature superconductors. This is the same region
where magnetic polarons were previously observed, suggesting that they drive
the nematicity in EuB6. This is also the region of the phase diagram where EuB6
shows a colossal magnetoresistance (CMR). This novel interplay between magnetic
and electronic properties could thus be harnessed for spintronic applications.

  Lynch (Random Structures Algorithms, 1992) showed that for every first order
sentence $\phi$, the limiting probability that $G_n$ satisfies $\phi$ as
$n\to\infty$ exists, and moreover it is an analytic function of $c$. In this
paper we consider the closure $\overline{L_c}$ in $[0,1]$ of the set $L_c$ of
all limiting probabilities of first order sentences in $G_n$. We show that
there exists a critical value $c_0 \approx0.93$ such that $\overline{L_c}=
[0,1]$ when $c \ge c_0$, whereas $\overline{L_c}$ misses at least one
subinterval when $c<c_0$. We extend these results to random $d$-uniform sparse
hypergraphs, where the probability of a hyperedge is given by $p=c/n^{d-1}$.

star Trappist-1 naturally poses the question: could Trappist-1 planets be home
to life? These planets orbit very close to the host star and are most
susceptible to the UV radiation emitted by the intense and frequent flares of
Trappist-1. Here we calculate the UV spectra (100 - 450 nm) of a superflare
observed on Trappist-1 with the K2 mission. We couple radiative transfer models
to this spectra to estimate the UV surface flux on planets in the habitable

single hidden layer 01 loss neural network trained with stochastic coordinate
descent as a defense against adversarial attacks in machine learning. One
measure of a model's robustness is the minimum distortion required to make the
input adversarial. This can be approximated with the Boundary Attack (Brendel
et. al. 2018) and HopSkipJump (Chen et. al. 2019) methods. We compare the
minimum distortion of the 01 loss network to the binarized neural network and
the standard sigmoid activation network with cross-entropy loss all trained
with and without Gaussian noise on the CIFAR10 benchmark binary classification
between classes 0 and 1. Both with and without noise training we find our 01
loss network to have the largest adversarial distortion of the three models by
non-trivial margins. To further validate these results we subject all models to
substitute model black box attacks under different distortion thresholds and
find that the 01 loss network is the hardest to attack across all distortions.
At a distortion of 0.125 both sigmoid activated cross-entropy loss and
binarized networks have almost 0% accuracy on adversarial examples whereas the
01 loss network is at 40%. Even though both 01 loss and the binarized network
use sign activations their training algorithms are different which in turn give
different solutions for robustness. Finally we compare our network to simple
convolutional models under substitute model black box attacks and find their
accuracies to be comparable. Our work shows that the 01 loss network has the
potential to defend against black box adversarial attacks better than convex
loss and binarized networks.

regime of plasma wave excitation and wakefield acceleration that removes this

spatiotemporal shaping of laser pulses, exploits the property that nonlinear
plasma waves with superluminal phase velocities cannot trap charged particles

difficult to optimize for embedded platforms. They are therefore not suitable
for real-time applications with embedded systems. As an alternative,
projection-based methods are more efficient and can run on embedded platforms.
However, the current state-of-the-art projection-based methods do not achieve

uses multiple paths with different scales and balances the computational

avoid redundant computations and make the network highly efficient. The

temperature on the crystal growth of the BaCu2As2 compound. While Pb and CuAs
self-flux produce the well-known {\alpha}-phase ThCr2Si2-type structure (Z=2),
a new polymorphic phase of BaCu2As2 (\b{eta} phase) with a much larger c
lattice parameter (Z=10), which could be considered an intergrowth of the
ThCr2Si2- and CaBe2Ge2-type structures, has been discovered via Sn flux growth.
We have characterized this structure through single-crystal X-ray diffraction,
transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and scanning transmission electron
microscopy (STEM) studies. Furthermore, we compare this new polymorphic
intergrowth structure with the {\alpha}-phase BaCu2As2 (ThCr2Si2 type with Z=2)
and the \b{eta}-phase BaCu2Sb2 (intergrowth of ThCr2Si2 and CaBe2Ge2 types with
Z=6), both with the same space group I4/mmm. Electrical transport studies
reveal p-type carriers and magnetoresistivity up to 22% at 5 K and under a
magnetic field of 7 T. Our work suggests a new route for the discovery of new
polymorphic structures through flux and temperature control during material
synthesis.

Transportation (LOT), which embeds the space of distributions into an

each distribution to a fixed reference distribution, and has a number of
benefits when it comes to speed of computation and to determining
classification boundaries. In this paper, we characterize a number of settings
in which LOT embeds families of distributions into a space in which they are
linearly separable. This is true in arbitrary dimension, and for families of
distributions generated through perturbations of shifts and scalings of a fixed
distribution.We also prove conditions under which the $L^2$ distance of the LOT
embedding between two distributions in arbitrary dimension is nearly isometric
to Wasserstein-2 distance between those distributions. This is of significant
computational benefit, as one must only compute $N$ optimal transport maps to
define the $N^2$ pairwise distances between $N$ distributions. We demonstrate
the benefits of LOT on a number of distribution classification problems.

environments that contribute to patient falls in hospitals and to propose a
computational model to evaluate patient room designs.
  Background: The existing fall risk assessment tools have an acceptable level
of sensitivity and specificity, however, they only consider intrinsic factors
and medications, making the prediction very limited in terms of how the
physical environment contributes to fall risk.
  Methods: We provide a computational model for risk of fall based on
physical-environment and patient-motion factors. We use a trajectory
optimization approach for patient motion prediction.
  Results: We run the proposed model on four room designs as examples of
various room design categories. Results show the capabilities of the proposed
model in identifying risky locations within the room.
  Conclusions: Our study shows the potential capabilities of the proposed
model. Due to lack of enough evidence for the examined factors, it is not
possible at this point to gain robust confidence in the final evaluations. More
studies using quantitative, relational, or causal designs are recommended to
inform the proposed model for patient falls.
  Application: Developing a comprehensive fall risk model is a significant step
in understanding and solving the problem of patient falls in hospitals. It can
provide guidance for healthcare decision makers to optimize effective
interventions to reduce risk of falls while promoting safe patient mobility in
the hospital room environment. We can also use it in healthcare technologies
such as assistive robots to provide informed assistance.

improvement in the hierarchical vote collective of transformation-based

HIVE-COTE using CIF is significantly more accurate on the UCR archive than any

tight-binding potential model fitted to density-functional calculations.
Finite-temperature properties are studied in the range from 50 to 1500~K. To
assess the magnitude of nuclear quantum effects in the properties of graphane,
classical molecular dynamics simulations have been also performed. These
quantum effects are significant in structural properties such as interatomic
distances and layer area at finite temperatures. The in-plane compressibility
of graphane is found to be about twice larger than that of graphene, and at low
temperature it is 9\% higher than the classical calculation. The thermal
expansion coefficient resulting from PIMD simulations vanishes in the
zero-temperature limit, in agreement with the third law of Thermodynamics.

show that twisted Conformal Killing Tensors (CKTs) are generically trivial when

variability can be the result of Doppler boosting in the kinked jet whose shape
changes with time (akin to the Vela pulsar jet). The deep X-ray image, composed

moving through the ambient medium at a transonic velocity. We also resolved a
faint 7$'$-long nonthermal collimated structure protruding from the PWN. It is
possibly another instance of a ""misaligned outflow"" (also known as a ""kinetic

tracing the interstellar magnetic field lines. Finally, taking advantage of the

predictive performance of classification models. Popular countermeasures
include oversampling the minority class. Standard methods like SMOTE rely on
finding nearest neighbours and linear interpolations which are problematic in
case of high-dimensional, complex data distributions. Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) have been proposed as an alternative method for generating
artificial minority examples as they can model complex distributions. However,
prior research on GAN-based oversampling does not incorporate recent
advancements from the literature on generating realistic tabular data with
GANs. Previous studies also focus on numerical variables whereas categorical
features are common in many business applications of classification methods
such as credit scoring. The paper propoes an oversampling method based on a
conditional Wasserstein GAN that can effectively model tabular datasets with
numerical and categorical variables and pays special attention to the
down-stream classification task through an auxiliary classifier loss. We
benchmark our method against standard oversampling methods and the imbalanced

constant epsilon_r=16.66 and a loss tangent tan_delta=0.0000343. It consists of
a very compact dielectric disk with a width of 2.035 mm and a tilt angle of 60
degree, resulting in a broadband coupling at a low RF field which has the
potential to survive in the high-power environment. To prevent a sharp
dielectric corner break, a 45 degree chamfer is also added. A microscale vacuum
gap, caused by metallic clamping between the thin coating and the outer thick
copper jacket, is also studied in detail. Through optimizations, more than 99%
of RF power is coupled into the DLA structure, with the maximum electromagnetic
fields located at a DLA structure. Tolerance studies on the geometrical
parameters and mechanical design of the full-assembly structure are also
carried out as a reference for realistic fabrication.

matrix-multiplication accelerators can achieve higher speed and improved power
efficiency. Though analog computing is known to be susceptible to noise and
device imperfections, various analog computing paradigms have been considered
as promising solutions to address the growing computing demand in machine
learning applications, thanks to the robustness of ANNs. This robustness has
been explored in low-precision, fixed-point ANN models, which have proven
successful on compressing ANN model size on digital computers. However, these
promising results and network training algorithms cannot be easily migrated to
analog accelerators. The reason is that digital computers typically carry
intermediate results with higher bit width, though the inputs and weights of
each ANN layers are of low bit width; while the analog intermediate results
have low precision, analogous to digital signals with a reduced quantization
level. Here we report a training method for mixed-signal ANN with two types of
errors in its analog signals, random noise, and deterministic errors
(distortions). The results showed that mixed-signal ANNs trained with our
proposed method can achieve an equivalent classification accuracy with noise

Gavel expresses these policies as optimization problems, making it easy to

link quality variations. We address this challenge by developing RECeiver
ORiented Policies (Recorp), which leverages the stability of IIoT workloads by
combining offline policy synthesis and run-time adaptation. Compared to
schedules that service a single flow in a slot, Recorp policies share slots
among multiple flows by assigning a coordinator and a list of flows that may be
serviced in the same slot. At run-time, the coordinator will execute one of the
flows depending on which flows the coordinator has already received. A salient
feature of Recorp is that it provides predictable performance: a policy meets
the end-to-end reliability and deadline of flows when the link quality exceeds
a user-specified threshold. Experiments show that across IIoT workloads,
policies provided a median increase of 50% to 142% in real-time capacity and a
median decrease of 27% to 70% in worst-case latency when schedules and policies
are configured to meet an end-to-end reliability of 99%.

in distribution over time. The proposed algorithm is unsupervised and learns to

is robust to temporal shifts in data distribution and can be used to produce
highly discriminative event-labeled features for health monitoring.

deconvolution of measured signals after filtering through a known dynamic

the input signal and the state of the intervening system. This is normally
posed as a special least-squares estimation problem with unbiasedness. The
approach has application in signal analysis and in control. Despite the
connection to optimal estimation, the standard algorithms are not necessarily
stable, leading to a number of recent papers which present sufficient
conditions for stability. In this paper we complete these stability results in
two ways in the time-invariant case: for the square case, where the number of
measurements equals the number of unknown inputs, we establish exactly the
location of the algorithm poles; for the non-square case, we show that the best
sufficient conditions are also necessary. We then draw on our previous results
interpreting these algorithms, when stable, as singular Kalman filters to
advocate a direct, guaranteed stable implementation via Kalman filtering. This
has the advantage of clarity and flexibility in addition to stability. En
route, we decipher the existing algorithms in terms of system inversion and
successive singular filtering. The stability results are extended to the

excellent for weakly-dispersive, completely specified wakes (e.g., the

argued that a potential liquid-liquid phase transition (LLPT) ending at a
liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) lies at the core of the anomalous behavior
of water. This transition which has been evidenced in multiple simulation
studies seems to be preempted experimentally by spontaneous crystallization.
Here, in order to expose the connection between the spontaneous crystallization
observed in the supercooled regime in the vicinity of the LLPT, and the density
anomaly, we perform extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations of a model mixture
of core-softened water and methanol. The pure water-like fluid exhibits a LLPT

LLPT but lacks the density anomaly. Our results illustrate the relation between
the vanishing of the density anomaly and an increase in the temperature of the
spontaneous crystallization: once this temperature surpasses the LLCP critical
temperature, no density anomaly is observed. This peculiar feature illustrates
how fine tuning the competitive interactions determine the anomalous behavior

is essential for increasing training efficiency. Moreover, in many real-world
application scenarios like healthcare, distributed learning can also keep the
data local and protect privacy. A popular distributed learning strategy is
federated learning, where there is a central server storing the global model
and a set of local computing nodes updating the model parameters with their
corresponding data. The updated model parameters will be processed and
transmitted to the central server, which leads to heavy communication costs.
Recently, asynchronous decentralized distributed learning has been proposed and
demonstrated to be a more efficient and practical strategy where there is no
central server, so that each computing node only communicates with its
neighbors. Although no raw data will be transmitted across different local
nodes, there is still a risk of information leak during the communication
process for malicious participants to make attacks. In this paper, we present a
differentially private version of asynchronous decentralized parallel SGD
(ADPSGD) framework, or A(DP)$^2$SGD for short, which maintains communication
efficiency of ADPSGD and prevents the inference from malicious participants.
Specifically, R{\'e}nyi differential privacy is used to provide tighter privacy
analysis for our composite Gaussian mechanisms while the convergence rate is
consistent with the non-private version. Theoretical analysis shows
A(DP)$^2$SGD also converges at the optimal $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ rate as
SGD. Empirically, A(DP)$^2$SGD achieves comparable model accuracy as the

coefficients and degree $d \geq 2$, and let $A$ be some large, non-empty,
finite subset of real numbers. We use $E_{s,2}(A)$ to denote the number of
solutions to the system of equations \[ \sum_{i=1}^{s} (\psi(x_i) -
\psi(x_{i+s}) )= \sum_{i=1}^{s} ( x_i - x_{i+s} ) = 0, \] where $x_i \in A$ for
each $1 \leq i \leq 2s$. Our main result shows that \[ E_{s,2}(A) \ll_{d,s}
|A|^{2s -3 + \eta_{s}}, \] where $\eta_3 = 1/2$, and $\eta_{s} = (1/4-
1/7246)\cdot 2^{-s + 4}$ when $s \geq 4$. The only other previously known
result of this flavour is due to Bourgain and Demeter, who showed that when
$\psi(x) = x^2$ and $s=3$, we have \[E_{3,2}(A) \ll_{\epsilon} |A|^{3 + 1/2 +
\epsilon},\] for each $\epsilon > 0$. Thus our main result improves upon the
above estimate, while also generalising it for larger values of $s$ and more
wide-ranging choices of $\psi(x)$.
  The novelty of our estimates is that they only depend on $d$, $s$ and $|A|$,
and are independent of the diameter of $A$. Thus when $A$ is a sparse set, our
results are stronger than the corresponding bounds that are provided by methods
such as decoupling and efficient congruencing. Consequently, our strategy
differs from these two lines of approach, and we employ techniques from
incidence geometry, arithmetic combinatorics and analytic number theory.
Amongst other applications, our estimates lead to stronger discrete restriction
estimates for sparse sequences.

reflecting surface (IRS) systems. Assuming imperfect user location information,
the effective angles from the IRS to the users are estimated, which is then
used to design the transmit beam and IRS beam. Furthermore, closed-form
expressions for the achievable rate are derived. The analytical findings
indicate that the achievable rate can be improved by increasing the number of
base station (BS) antennas or reflecting elements. Specifically, a power gain
of order $N M^2$ is achieved, where $N$ is the antenna number and $M$ is the
number of reflecting elements. Moreover, with a large number of reflecting
elements, the individual signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is
proportional to $M$, while becomes proportional to $M^2$ as non-line-of-sight
(NLOS) paths vanish. Also, it has been shown that high location uncertainty
would significantly degrade the achievable rate. Besides, IRSs should be
deployed at distinct directions (relative to the BS) and be far away from each
other to reduce the interference from multiple IRSs. Finally, an optimal power
allocation scheme has been proposed to improve the system performance.

At temperatures high enough that the magnetic moments fluctuate at high
frequencies, the spin Hall angle, the conversion yield between spin current and
charge current, is independent of temperature. The spin Hall angle starts to
decrease at a certain temperature $T^{*}$ and completely vanishes at a lower
temperature. We argue that the latter corresponds to the spin freezing

of conduction electron spin is randomized by the exchange coupling with the
localized moments. The present experiment \textit{quantitatively} verifies the

also quantified a time scale of fluctuation of local magnetic moments in the

fundamental level, but obtaining analytical or numerical solutions often
remains a challenge. We propose an experimental quantum simulation scheme to
study ground state properties in two-dimensional quantum electrodynamics (2D
QED) using existing quantum technology. The proposal builds on a formulation of
lattice gauge theories as effective spin models in arXiv:2006.14160, which
reduces the number of qubits needed by eliminating redundant degrees of freedom
and by using an efficient truncation scheme for the gauge fields. The latter
endows our proposal with the perspective to take a well-controlled continuum
limit. Our protocols allow in principle scaling up to large lattices and offer
the perspective to connect the lattice simulation to low energy observable
quantities, e.g. the hadron spectrum, in the continuum theory. By including
both dynamical matter and a non-minimal gauge field truncation, we provide the
novel opportunity to observe 2D effects on present-day quantum hardware. More
specifically, we present two Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) based
protocols for the study of magnetic field effects, and for taking an important
first step towards computing the running coupling of QED. For both instances,
we include variational quantum circuits for qubit-based hardware, which we
explicitly apply to trapped ion quantum computers. We simulate the proposed VQE
experiments classically to calculate the required measurement budget under
realistic conditions. While this feasibility analysis is done for trapped ions,
our approach can be easily adapted to other platforms. The techniques presented
here, combined with advancements in quantum hardware pave the way for reaching
beyond the capabilities of classical simulations by extending our framework to
include fermionic potentials or topological terms.

emphasis on the bulge metallicity distribution function and globular clusters.
A key result is the strong correlation (sigma ~ 0.2 dex) between (u-i)o and
[Fe/H] for bulge red clump giants. We utilized this relation to find that
interior bulge fields may be well described by simple closed box enrichment
models, but fields exterior to b ~ -6 degrees seem to require a secondary
metal-poor component. Applying scaled versions of the closed box model to the
outer bulge fields is shown to significantly reduce the strengths of any
additional metal-poor components when compared to Gaussian mixture models.
Additional results include: a confirmation that the u-band splits the sub-giant
branch in M 22 as a function of metallicity, the detection of possible
extra-tidal stars along the orbits of M 22 and FSR 1758, and additional
evidence that NGC 6569 may have a small but discrete He spread, as evidenced by
red clump luminosity variations in the reddest bands. We do not confirm

overidentifying moment restrictions. The empirical likelihood (EL) RD estimator
efficiently incorporates the information from covariate balance and thus has an
asymptotic variance no larger than that of the standard estimator without
covariates. It achieves efficiency gain under weak conditions. We resolve the
indeterminacy raised by Calonico, Cattaneo, Farrell, and Titiunik (2019, Page
448) regarding the asymptotic efficiency gain from incorporating covariates to
RD estimator, as their estimator has the same asymptotic variance as ours. We
then propose a robust corrected EL (RCEL) confidence set which achieves the
fast n^(-1) coverage error decay rate even though the point estimator converges
at a nonparametric rate. In addition, the coverage accuracy of the RCEL
confidence set is automatically robust against slight perturbation to the
covariate balance condition, which may happen in cases such as data
contamination and misspecified ""unaffected"" outcomes used as covariates. We
also show a uniform-in-bandwidth Wilks theorem, which is useful in sensitivity
analysis for the proposed RCEL confidence set in the sense of Armstrong and

application known as CITISEN. The CITISEN provides three functions: speech
enhancement (SE), model adaptation (MA), and background noise conversion (BNC),
allowing CITISEN to be used as a platform for utilizing and evaluating SE
models and flexibly extend the models to address various noise environments and
users. For SE, a pretrained SE model downloaded from the cloud server is used
to effectively reduce noise components from instant or saved recordings
provided by users. For encountering unseen noise or speaker environments, the
MA function is applied to promote CITISEN. A few audio samples recording on a
noisy environment are uploaded and used to adapt the pretrained SE model on the
server. Finally, for BNC, CITISEN first removes the background noises through
an SE model and then mixes the processed speech with new background noise. The
novel BNC function can evaluate SE performance under specific conditions, cover
people's tracks, and provide entertainment. The experimental results confirmed
the effectiveness of SE, MA, and BNC functions. Compared with the noisy speech
signals, the enhanced speech signals achieved about 6\% and 33\% of
improvements, respectively, in terms of short-time objective intelligibility
(STOI) and perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ). With MA, the STOI
and PESQ could be further improved by approximately 6\% and 11\%, respectively.
Finally, the BNC experiment results indicated that the speech signals converted
from noisy and silent backgrounds have a close scene identification accuracy
and similar embeddings in an acoustic scene classification model. Therefore,
the proposed BNC can effectively convert the background noise of a speech
signal and be a data augmentation method when clean speech signals are
unavailable.

field (MF) configuration in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In the case of constant
MF, the synchrotron polarization in the prompt phase of GRBs has been widely
studied. In this paper, we consider the case of the decaying MF. We calculate
the time-averaged and instantaneous synchrotron polarizations in a pulse for
different viewing angles and for the large-scale decaying MF model, which can
explain the so-called Band spectrum. We find that the on-axis time-averaged
polarization degree (PD) in the energy band of 50-500 keV for the decaying
large-scale MF model ($\sim 0.6$ for typical parameters) is higher than that in
the constant MF model ($\sim 0.5$). An interesting result is the instantaneous
PD in the off-axis case will experience a turnover, i.e., the PD will evolve
from a positive value to a negative one. This suggests the polarization angle
(PA) change by an angle of $90^\circ$. Such a result is roughly consistent with
the discovery of the PA evolution within a pulse in some bursts, such as GRB
170114A and GRB 160821A. Our result implies at least a part of bursts (off-axis
bursts) should have the PA evolution in a pulse.

at redshifts well beyond two. Baryonic physics, like stellar and active
galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback in this very active epoch, are expected to have
left a strong imprint on the thermo-dynamic properties of these early galaxy
groups. Therefore, observations of these groups are key to constrain the
relative importance of these physical processes. However, current instruments
are not sensitive enough to detect them easily and characterize their hot gas
content. In this work, we quantify the observing power of the Advanced
Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics (Athena), the future large X-ray
observatory of the European Space Agency (ESA), for discovering and
characterizing early galaxy groups at high redshifts. We used the SImulation of
X-ray TElescopes (SIXTE) simulator to mimic Athena observations, and a
custom-made wavelet-based algorithm to detect galaxy groups and clusters in the
redshift range $0.5 \le z \le 4$. We performed extensive X-ray spectral fitting
in order to characterize their gas temperature and X-ray luminosity. We also
investigate how well Athena will constrain different feedback mechanisms. In
the deep Wide Field Imager (WFI) survey expected to be carried out during part
of Athena's first four years (the nominal mission lifetime) more than 10,000
galaxy groups and clusters at $z\ge 0.5$ will be discovered. We find that
Athena can detect $\sim20$ high-redshift galaxy groups with masses of
$M_{500}\geq$ $5\times 10^{13}$ $M_{\odot}$ and $z\geq2$, and almost half of
them will have a gas temperature determined to a precision of $\Delta T/T \le

efficiently as extended sources by Athena and that a key parameter determining
the total number of such newly discovered sources is the area on the sky

popularity bias which is a well-known phenomenon in recommendation is one
important factor leading to miscalibration in recommendation. Our experimental
results using two real-world datasets show that there is a connection between

of the Dirac cone with a linear dispersion is shown by calculating density of

HOMO (highest occupied molecular orbital) and LUMO (lowest unoccupied molecular

molecular layers. This is a newly found mechanism in addition to the indirect

time-frequency (TF) filters to pass a targeted temporal mode (TM), and to
reject background (noise) photons in the TF detection window? The solution for
coherent TF filtering is known, the quantum pulse gate, whereas the
conventional, more common method is implemented by a sequence of incoherent
spectral filtering and temporal gating operations. To compare these two
methods, we derive a general formalism for two-stage incoherent time frequency
filtering, finding expressions for signal pulse transmission efficiency, and
for the ability to discriminate TMs, which allows the blocking of unwanted

discrimination ability, and find a remarkably concise relation between these

applied to any state of light occupying the input temporal mode, e.g.,
classical coherent-state signals or pulsed single photon states of light. We
point out implications in classical and quantum optical communications. As an

high signal transmission is needed to ensure a useful key generation rate.

make their algorithms transparent to the users they affect? Despite growing
calls for algorithmic transparency, most firms have kept their algorithms
opaque, citing potential gaming by users that may negatively affect the
algorithm's predictive power. We develop an analytical model to compare firm
and user surplus with and without algorithmic transparency in the presence of
strategic users and present novel insights. We identify a broad set of
conditions under which making the algorithm transparent benefits the firm. We
show that, in some cases, even the predictive power of machine learning
algorithms may increase if the firm makes them transparent. By contrast, users
may not always be better off under algorithmic transparency. The results hold
even when the predictive power of the opaque algorithm comes largely from
correlational features and the cost for users to improve on them is close to
zero. Overall, our results show that firms should not view manipulation by
users as bad. Rather, they should use algorithmic transparency as a lever to
motivate users to invest in more desirable features.

manipulations such as poisoning attacks and label flips. By carefully
manipulating a subset of training samples, the attacker forces the learner to
compute an incorrect decision boundary, thereby cause misclassifications.
Considering the increased importance of SVMs in engineering and life-critical
applications, we develop a novel defense algorithm that improves resistance
against such attacks. Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) is a promising
metric that characterizes the outlierness of data samples. In this work, we
introduce a new approximation of LID called K-LID that uses kernel distance in
the LID calculation, which allows LID to be calculated in high dimensional
transformed spaces. We introduce a weighted SVM against such attacks using
K-LID as a distinguishing characteristic that de-emphasizes the effect of
suspicious data samples on the SVM decision boundary. Each sample is weighted
on how likely its K-LID value is from the benign K-LID distribution rather than
the attacked K-LID distribution. We then demonstrate how the proposed defense
can be applied to a distributed SVM framework through a case study on an
SDR-based surveillance system. Experiments with benchmark data sets show that
the proposed defense reduces classification error rates substantially (10% on
average).

string wall appears in two-step symmetry break transition from normal phase to
polar-distorted B phase and turn out to be the descendants of HQVs of polar

the spin orbital coupling is taken into account. This means HQVs are 1D nexus
which connects the spin solitons and the KLS domain walls. This is because the
subgroup $G=\pi_{1}(S_{S}^{1},\tilde{R}_{2})$ of relative homotopy group
describing the spin solitons is isomorphic to the group describing the half

pseudo-random lattices of inseparable and separable spin solitons. These two

scintillation crystals (305 kg) with natural Ca ($^{\rm nat.}$Ca) isotope which

4$\pi$ active shield of a liquid scintillator surrounding the CaF$_2$ crystals.
The internal backgrounds caused by the radioactive impurities within the

pulse shape. We analyzed the data obtained in the Kamioka underground for a
live-time of 130.4\,days to evaluate the feasibility of the low background
measurement with the CANDLES-III detector. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we
estimated the background rate from the radioactive impurities in the CaF$_{2}$
crystals and the rate of high energy $\gamma$-rays caused by the (n, $\gamma$)
reactions induced by environmental neutrons. The expected background rate was
in a good agreement with the measured rate, i.e., approximately 10$^{-3}$
events/keV/yr/(kg of $^{\rm nat.}$Ca), in the 0$\nu\beta\beta$ window. In
conclusion, the background candidates were estimated properly by comparing the
measured energy spectrum with the background simulations. With this measurement
method, we performed the first search for 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay in a low
background condition using a detector with a Ca isotope, in which the Ca
present was not enriched, in a scale of hundreds of kg. The $^{48}$Ca isotope
has a high potential for use in 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay search, and is expected
to be useful for the development of a next-generation detector for highly

non-indigenous marine species to establish in new areas. There is growing
interest within jurisdictions to strengthen biofouling risk-management

collected data to determine the biofouling state of vessel hulls. Machine
learning is well suited to tackle the latter challenge, and here we apply deep
learning to automate the classification of images from in-water inspections to
identify the presence and severity of fouling. We combined several datasets to
obtain over 10,000 images collected from in-water surveys which were annotated
by a group biofouling experts. We compared the annotations from three experts
on a 120-sample subset of these images, and found that they showed 89%
agreement (95% CI: 87-92%). Subsequent labelling of the whole dataset by one of
these experts achieved similar levels of agreement with this group of experts,
which we defined as performing at most 5% worse (p=0.009-0.054). Using these
expert labels, we were able to train a deep learning model that also agreed
similarly with the group of experts (p=0.001-0.014), demonstrating that
automated analysis of biofouling in images is feasible and effective using this
method.

exceptionally fast path at the expense of another, which is thus forced to wait
and waste energy. Our solution, FairFly, addresses the fair planning question
for general autonomous systems, including UAV fleets, subject to complex
missions typical of urban applications. FairFly formalizes each mission in
temporal logic. An offline search finds the fairest paths that satisfy the
missions and can be flown by the UAVs, leading to lighter online control load.
It allows explicit negotiation between UAVs to enable imbalanced path durations

that any sequence of super Ricci flows of the same dimension that is pointed in
an appropriate sense subsequentially converges to a certain type of synthetic
flow, called a metric flow. We will study the geometric and analytic properties
of this limiting flow, as well as the convergence in detail. We will also see
that, under appropriate local curvature bounds, a limit of Ricci flows can be
decomposed into a regular and singular part. The regular part can be endowed
with a canonical structure of a Ricci flow spacetime and we have smooth
convergence on a certain subset of the regular part.

assess the properties of damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) that are
associated with galaxies and their underlying dark matter haloes between 0

higher redshift; a significant fraction of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) resides
in the outskirts of galaxies with stellar mass greater than or equal to
10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$; and the covering fraction of DLAs in the circumgalactic
medium (CGM) is enhanced relative to that of the interstellar medium (ISM) with
increasing halo mass. Moreover, we find that the mean density of the HI in
galaxies increases with increasing stellar mass, while the DLAs in high- and
low-halo-mass systems have higher column densities than those in galaxies with
intermediate halo masses (~ 10$^{12}$ M$_\odot$ at z = 0). These high-impact
CGM DLAs in high-stellar-mass systems tend to be metal-poor, likely tracing
smooth accretion. Overall, our results point to the CGM playing an important

massive information and matching user interests. While many efforts have been
devoted to developing more effective models in various scenarios, the
exploration on the explainability of recommender systems is running behind.
Explanations could help improve user experience and discover system defects. In
this paper, after formally introducing the elements that are related to model
explainability, we propose a novel explainable recommendation model through
improving the transparency of the representation learning process.
Specifically, to overcome the representation entangling problem in traditional
models, we revise traditional graph convolution to discriminate information
from different layers. Also, each representation vector is factorized into
several segments, where each segment relates to one semantic aspect in data.
Different from previous work, in our model, factor discovery and representation
learning are simultaneously conducted, and we are able to handle extra
attribute information and knowledge. In this way, the proposed model can learn
interpretable and meaningful representations for users and items. Unlike
traditional methods that need to make a trade-off between explainability and
effectiveness, the performance of our proposed explainable model is not
negatively affected after considering explainability. Finally, comprehensive
experiments are conducted to validate the performance of our model as well as
explanation faithfulness.

statistical properties of matrix elements $\{O_{\gamma\alpha}\}$ of an

coarse-grained into energy shells of width $\Delta_E$, with which one can
define a block submatrix $\tilde{O}^{(b,a)}$ consisting of elements between
eigenstates in the $a$th and $b$th shells. Each block submatrix is
characterized by constant values of $E_{\gamma\alpha}=(E_\gamma+E_\alpha)/2
\simeq \tilde{E}$ and $\omega_{\gamma\alpha}= (E_\gamma-E_\alpha) \simeq
\omega$ up to $\Delta_E$. We will show that all matrix elements within a block
are statistically equivalent to each other in the non-integrable case. Their
distribution is characterized by $\bar{E}$ and $\omega$, and follows the
prediction of the ETH. In stark contrast, eigenstate-to-eigenstate fluctuations
persist in the integrable case. Consequently, matrix elements
$O_{\gamma\alpha}$ cannot be characterized by the energy parameters
$E_{\gamma\alpha}$ and $\omega_{\gamma\alpha}$ only. Our result explains the

transformation process is necessary to transform it, with overhead cost the
smaller the better, into a functionally equivalent one so that the connectivity
constraints imposed by the QPU are satisfied. While several algorithms have
been proposed for this goal, the overhead costs are often very high, which
degenerates the fidelity of the obtained circuits sharply. One major reason for
this lies in that, due to the high branching factor and vast search space,
almost all these algorithms only search very shallowly and thus, very often,
only (at most) locally optimal solutions can be reached. In this paper, we
propose a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to tackle the circuit

general framework supports implementations aiming to reduce either the size or

conform to a 3D ordered state? Here, using a quasi-1D organic ferroelectric,
TTF-CA, with degenerate polar dimers, we pursue the fate of a spin-soliton

to a 3D ferroelectric order by resistivity, NMR and NQR measurements. We
demonstrate that the soliton matter undergoes neutral spin-spin soliton pairing

former contributes to the magnetism through triplet excitations whereas the
latter carries electrical current. Our results reveal the whole picture of a
soliton matter that condenses into the 3D ordered state.

reliability in computer systems. Logs are a common and major data source for
anomaly detection methods in almost every computer system. They collect a range
of significant events describing the runtime system status. Recent studies have
focused predominantly on one-class deep learning methods on predefined
non-learnable numerical log representations. The main limitation is that these
models are not able to learn log representations describing the semantic
differences between normal and anomaly logs, leading to a poor generalization
of unseen logs. We propose Logsy, a classification-based method to learn log
representations in a way to distinguish between normal data from the system of
interest and anomaly samples from auxiliary log datasets, easily accessible via
the internet. The idea behind such an approach to anomaly detection is that the
auxiliary dataset is sufficiently informative to enhance the representation of
the normal data, yet diverse to regularize against overfitting and improve
generalization. We propose an attention-based encoder model with a new
hyperspherical loss function. This enables learning compact log representations
capturing the intrinsic differences between normal and anomaly logs.
Empirically, we show an average improvement of 0.25 in the F1 score, compared
to the previous methods. To investigate the properties of Logsy, we perform
additional experiments including evaluation of the effect of the auxiliary data
size, the influence of expert knowledge, and the quality of the learned log
representations. The results show that the learned representation boost the
performance of the previous methods such as PCA with a relative improvement of
28.2%.

However, since the modern RNNs, including long-short term memory (LSTM) and

space/computation complexity, compressing them becomes a hot and promising
topic in recent years. Among plenty of compression methods, tensor
decomposition, e.g., tensor train (TT), block term (BT), tensor ring (TR) and
hierarchical Tucker (HT), appears to be the most amazing approach since a very
high compression ratio might be obtained. Nevertheless, none of these tensor
decomposition formats can provide both the space and computation efficiency. In
this paper, we consider to compress RNNs based on a novel Kronecker
CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (KCP) decomposition, which is derived from Kronecker tensor
(KT) decomposition, by proposing two fast algorithms of multiplication between
the input and the tensor-decomposed weight. According to our experiments based

the proposed KCP-RNNs have comparable performance of accuracy with those in

  Connections with the Solar Dynamo","Invited review submitted to Science China: Physics, Mechanics &
  Astronomy",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The meridional circulation of the Sun, which is observed to be poleward at
the surface, should have a return flow at some depth. Since large-scale flows
like the differential rotation and the meridional circulation are driven by
turbulent stresses in the convection zone, these flows are expected to remain
confined within this zone. Current observational (based on helioseismology) and
theoretical (based on dynamo theory) evidences point towards an equatorward
return flow of the meridional circulation at the bottom of the convection zone.
Assuming the mean values of various quantities averaged over turbulence to be
axisymmetric, we study the large-scale flows in solar-like stars on the basis
of a 2D mean field theory. Turbulent stresses in a rotating star can transport
angular momentum, setting up a differential rotation. The meridional
circulation arises from a slight imbalance between two terms which try to drive
it in opposite directions: a thermal wind term (arising out of the higher
efficiency of convective heat transport in the polar regions) and a centrifugal
term (arising out of the differential rotation). To make these terms
comparable, the poles of the Sun should be slightly hotter than the equator. We
discuss the important role played by the meridional circulation in the flux
transport dynamo model. The poloidal field generated by the Babcock--Leighton
process at the surface is advected poleward, whereas the toroidal field
produced at the bottom of the convection zone is advected equatorward. The
fluctuations in the meridional circulation (with coherence time of about 30--40
yr) help in explaining many aspects of the irregularities in the solar cycle.
Finally, we discuss how the Lorentz force of the dynamo-generated magnetic
field can cause periodic variations in the large-scale flows with the solar
cycle.

contact tracing during an outbreak's early stage. However, mathematical models
suggest that epidemic control for SARS-CoV-2 transmission with manual contact
tracing is implausible. To reduce the effort of contact tracing, many digital
contact tracing projects (e.g., PEPP-PT, DP-3T, TCN, BlueTrace, Google/Apple
Exposure Notification, and East/West Coast PACT) are being developed to
supplement manual contact tracing. However, digital contact tracing has drawn
scrutiny from privacy advocates, since governments or other parties may attempt
to use contact tracing protocols for mass surveillance. As a result, many
digital contact tracing projects build privacy-preserving mechanisms to limit
the amount of privacy-sensitive information leaked by the protocol. In this
paper, we examine how these architectures resist certain classes of attacks,
specifically DoS attacks, and present BlindSignedIDs, a privacy-preserving
digital contact tracing mechanism, which are verifiable ephemeral identifiers

showed BlindSignedID can effectively deny bogus EphIDs, mitigating DoS attacks
on the local storage beyond 90% of stored EphIDs. Our example DoS attacks
showed that using 4 attackers can cause the gigabyte level DoS attacks within

analytically investigated in silicene as a function of electron temperature

follow the Bloch-Gr\""{u}neisen power-law $\propto T_e^4$ and $n_s^{-0.5}$, as
in graphene, and for $T_e \lesssim20-30$ K, the power loss is predominantly due
to the intravalley acoustic phonon scattering. On the other hand,
dispersionless low energy intervalley acoustic phonons begin to dominate the
power transfer at temperatures as low as $\sim$$30$ K, and optical phonons
dominate at $T_e \gtrsim200$ K, unlike the graphene. The total power loss
increases with $T_e$ with a value of $\sim$$10^{10}$ eV/s at $300$ K, which is
the same order of magnitude as in graphene. The power loss due to intravalley
acoustic phonons increases with $n_s$ at higher $T_e$, whereas due to the
intervalley acoustic and optical phonons is found to be independent of $n_s$.
Interestingly, the energy relaxation time in silicene is about $4$ times higher
than that in graphene. For this reason, silicene may be superior over graphene
for its applications in bolometers and calorimeters. Power transfer to the
surface optical phonons $P_{\text{SO}}$ is also studied as a function of $T_e$

tasks in a related but different target domain. Traditional domain adaptation
algorithms assume that enough labeled data, which are treated as the prior
knowledge are available in the source domain. However, these algorithms will be
infeasible when only a few labeled data exist in the source domain, and thus
the performance decreases significantly. To address this challenge, we propose
a Domain-invariant Graph Learning (DGL) approach for domain adaptation with
only a few labeled source samples. Firstly, DGL introduces the Nystrom method
to construct a plastic graph that shares similar geometric property as the
target domain. And then, DGL flexibly employs the Nystrom approximation error
to measure the divergence between plastic graph and source graph to formalize
the distribution mismatch from the geometric perspective. Through minimizing
the approximation error, DGL learns a domain-invariant geometric graph to
bridge source and target domains. Finally, we integrate the learned
domain-invariant graph with the semi-supervised learning and further propose an
adaptive semi-supervised model to handle the cross-domain problems. The results
of extensive experiments on popular datasets verify the superiority of DGL,
especially when only a few labeled source samples are available.

Nowadays, a considerable proportion of users visit e-commerce platforms by
mobile devices. Due to the limited screen size of mobile devices, positions of
items have a significant influence on clicks: 1) Higher positions lead to more
clicks for one commodity. 2) The 'pseudo-exposure' issue: Only a few
recommended items are shown at first glance and users need to slide the screen
to browse other items. Therefore, some recommended items ranked behind are not
viewed by users and it is not proper to treat this kind of items as negative
samples. While many works model the online recommendation as contextual bandit
problems, they rarely take the influence of positions into consideration and
thus the estimation of the reward function may be biased. In this paper, we aim
at addressing these two issues to improve the performance of online mobile
recommendation. Our contributions are four-fold. First, since we concern the
reward of a set of recommended items, we model the online recommendation as a
contextual combinatorial bandit problem and define the reward of a recommended
set. Second, we propose a novel contextual combinatorial bandit method called
UBM-LinUCB to address two issues related to positions by adopting the User

regret analysis and prove that our algorithm achieves sublinear regret
independent of the number of items. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on two
real-world datasets by a novel unbiased estimator. An online experiment is also
implemented in Taobao, one of the most popular e-commerce platforms in the

contextual bandit algorithms.

extragalactic point sources in the observing frequencies. In this work, we
investigate the possibility of detecting the power spectrum of the redshifted
21-cm signal by using strong gravitational lensing of the galaxy clusters. This
method has the advantage that it only enhances the \HI signal and not the
diffuse galactic foreground. Based on four simple models of the cluster
potentials we show that the strong lenses at relatively lower redshifts with
more than one dark matter halo significantly enhances the 21-cm signal from the
post reionization era. We discuss the merits and demerits of the method and the
future studies required for further investigations.

the buildup of domains with cooperative dynamics that become increasingly rigid

model for real-world applications. Despite many recent efforts on GANs that
have been contributed, mode collapse and instability of GANs are still open
problems caused by their adversarial optimization difficulties. In this paper,
motivated by the cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm, we propose a
Cooperative Dual Evolution based Generative Adversarial Network (CDE-GAN) to
circumvent these drawbacks. In essence, CDE-GAN incorporates dual evolution
with respect to the generator(s) and discriminators into a unified evolutionary
adversarial framework to conduct effective adversarial multi-objective
optimization. Thus it exploits the complementary properties and injects dual
mutation diversity into training to steadily diversify the estimated density in
capturing multi-modes and improve generative performance. Specifically, CDE-GAN
decomposes the complex adversarial optimization problem into two subproblems
(generation and discrimination), and each subproblem is solved with a separated
subpopulation (E-Generator} and E-Discriminators), evolved by its own
evolutionary algorithm. Additionally, we further propose a Soft Mechanism to
balance the trade-off between E-Generators and E-Discriminators to conduct
steady training for CDE-GAN. Extensive experiments on one synthetic dataset and
three real-world benchmark image datasets demonstrate that the proposed CDE-GAN
achieves a competitive and superior performance in generating good quality and
diverse samples over baselines. The code and more generated results are

aerial images that are often distributed with large scale variations and
arbitrary orientations. However most of existing methods rely on heuristically
defined anchors with different scales, angles and aspect ratios and usually
suffer from severe misalignment between anchor boxes and axis-aligned
convolutional features, which leads to the common inconsistency between the
classification score and localization accuracy. To address this issue, we
propose a Single-shot Alignment Network (S$^2$A-Net) consisting of two modules:
a Feature Alignment Module (FAM) and an Oriented Detection Module (ODM). The
FAM can generate high-quality anchors with an Anchor Refinement Network and
adaptively align the convolutional features according to the anchor boxes with
a novel Alignment Convolution. The ODM first adopts active rotating filters to
encode the orientation information and then produces orientation-sensitive and
orientation-invariant features to alleviate the inconsistency between
classification score and localization accuracy. Besides, we further explore the
approach to detect objects in large-size images, which leads to a better
trade-off between speed and accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance on two commonly used aerial
objects datasets (i.e., DOTA and HRSC2016) while keeping high efficiency. The

dispersal can lead to a sustainable population in a region, provided the
amplitude of environmental fluctuations is below an extinction threshold. We
have identified two types of sustainable populations: high-density and
low-density populations (through a mean-field approximation, valid in the limit
of large dispersal length). Our results show that patches where population is
high, low or extinct, coexist when the population is close to global extinction
(even for homogeneous habitats). The extinction threshold is maximum for
characteristic dispersal distances much larger than the spatial scale of
synchrony of environmental fluctuations. The extinction threshold increases
proportionally to the square root of the dispersal rate and decreases with the
Allee threshold. The low-density population solution can allow understanding
difficulties in recovery after harvesting. This theoretical framework provides
a novel approach to address other factors, such as habitat fragmentation or
harvesting, impacting population resilience to environmental fluctuations.

for the communications between the UAV and the ground user, namely, the
downlink (DL) and the uplink (UL) communications. In particular, the channel
state information (CSI) of the eavesdropping channels is assumed to be
imperfect. We aim to maximize the average worst-case secrecy rate by the robust
joint design of the UAV's trajectory, RIS's passive beamforming, and transmit
power of the legitimate transmitters. It is challenging to solve the Joint
UL/DL optimization problem due to its non-convexity. To this end, we develop an

Specifically, the formulated problem is divided into three sub-problems, and
the successive convex approximation (SCA), S-Procedure, and semidefinite
relaxation (SDR) are applied to tackle these non-convex sub-problems. Numerical
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can considerably improve the

correctly apply capture-recapture methods. Unfortunately, for reasons of
confidentiality access to such data may be limited. To overcome this issue we
apply and extend the hierarchical Poisson-Gamma model proposed by Zhang (2008),
which initially was used to estimate the number of irregular foreigners in
Norway.
  The model is an alternative to the current capture-recapture approach as it
does not require linking multiple sources and is solely based on aggregated
administrative data that include (1) the number of apprehended irregular
foreigners, (2) the number of foreigners who faced criminal charges and (3) the
number of foreigners registered in the central population register. The model
explicitly assumes a relationship between the unauthorized and registered
population, which is motivated by the interconnection between these two groups.
This makes the estimation conditionally dependent on the size of regular
population, provides interpretation with analogy to registered population and
makes the estimated parameter more stable over time.
  In this paper, we modify the original idea to allow for covariates and
flexible count distributions in order to estimate the number of irregular
foreigners in Poland in 2019. We also propose a parametric bootstrap for
estimating standard errors of estimates. Based on the extended model we
conclude that in as of 31.03.2019 and 30.09.2019 around 15,000 and 20,000
foreigners and were residing in Poland without valid permits. This means that
those apprehended by the Polish Border Guard account for around 15-20% of the
total.

batch normalization. The tree traversal is divided into two steps. At first
stage, the width-first search over models is applied for discover the start

run to traverse tree-structured LSTM. Proposed method enables us to explore the

induce a forest, star forest or disjoint union of vertices and edges,
respectively. Hence, every injective colouring is a star colouring and every
star colouring is an acyclic colouring. The corresponding decision problems are
Acyclic Colouring, Star Colouring and Injective Colouring (the last problem is
also known as $L(1,1)$-Labelling). A classical complexity result on Colouring
is a well-known dichotomy for $H$-free graphs (a graph is $H$-free if it does
not contain $H$ as an induced subgraph). In contrast, there is no systematic
study into the computational complexity of Acyclic Colouring, Star Colouring
and Injective Colouring despite numerous algorithmic and structural results
that have appeared over the years. We perform such a study and give almost
complete complexity classifications for Acyclic Colouring, Star Colouring and
Injective Colouring on $H$-free graphs (for each of the problems, we have one
open case). Moreover, we give full complexity classifications if the number of
colours $k$ is fixed, that is, not part of the input. From our study it follows
that for fixed $k$ the three problems behave in the same way, but this is no
longer true if $k$ is part of the input. To obtain several of our results we
prove stronger complexity results that in particular involve the girth of a
graph and the class of line graphs of multigraphs.

and is prone to subjective interpretation of scoring rules with low intra- and
interscorer reliability. Many automatic systems rely on few small-scale
databases for developing models, and generalizability to new datasets is thus
unknown. We investigated a novel deep neural network to assess the
generalizability of several large-scale cohorts.
  Methods: A deep neural network model was developed using 15684
polysomnography studies from five different cohorts. We applied four different
scenarios: 1) impact of varying time-scales in the model; 2) performance of a
single cohort on other cohorts of smaller, greater or equal size relative to
the performance of other cohorts on a single cohort; 3) varying the fraction of
mixed-cohort training data compared to using single-origin data; and 4)
comparing models trained on combinations of data from 2, 3, and 4 cohorts.
  Results: Overall classification accuracy improved with increasing fractions
of training data (0.25$\%$: 0.782 $\pm$ 0.097, 95$\%$ CI [0.777-0.787];
100$\%$: 0.869 $\pm$ 0.064, 95$\%$ CI [0.864-0.872]), and with increasing
number of data sources (2: 0.788 $\pm$ 0.102, 95$\%$ CI [0.787-0.790]; 3: 0.808
$\pm$ 0.092, 95$\%$ CI [0.807-0.810]; 4: 0.821 $\pm$ 0.085, 95$\%$ CI
[0.819-0.823]). Different cohorts show varying levels of generalization to
other cohorts.
  Conclusions: Automatic sleep stage scoring systems based on deep learning
algorithms should consider as much data as possible from as many sources
available to ensure proper generalization. Public datasets for benchmarking
should be made available for future research.

one-third of the cancer cases. Benign skin cancers are not fatal, can be cured
with proper medication. But it is not the same as the malignant skin cancers.
In the case of malignant melanoma, in its peak stage, the maximum life
expectancy is less than or equal to 5 years. But, it can be cured if detected
in early stages. Though there are numerous clinical procedures, the accuracy of
diagnosis falls between 49% to 81% and is time-consuming. So, dermoscopy has
been brought into the picture. It helped in increasing the accuracy of
diagnosis but could not demolish the error-prone behaviour. A quick and less
error-prone solution is needed to diagnose this majorly growing skin cancer.
This project deals with the usage of deep learning in skin lesion
classification. In this project, an automated model for skin lesion
classification using dermoscopic images has been developed with CNN(Convolution
Neural Networks) as a training model. Convolution neural networks are known for
capturing features of an image. So, they are preferred in analyzing medical
images to find the characteristics that drive the model towards success.
Techniques like data augmentation for tackling class imbalance, segmentation
for focusing on the region of interest and 10-fold cross-validation to make the
model robust have been brought into the picture. This project also includes
usage of certain preprocessing techniques like brightening the images using
piece-wise linear transformation function, grayscale conversion of the image,
resize the image. This project throws a set of valuable insights on how the
accuracy of the model hikes with the bringing of new input strategies,
preprocessing techniques. The best accuracy this model could achieve is 0.886.

overlapping adjacent hard-sphere molecules (HSMs). The two HSMs suddenly
acquired the identical new spin in opposite directions, so the two-dimensional

wireless networks by distributing different coded segments of each file in
multiple cache nodes. This paper aims to find a wireless coded caching policy
to minimize the total discounted network cost, which involves both transmission
delay and cache replacement cost, using tools from deep learning. The problem
is known to be challenging due to the unknown, time-variant content popularity
as well as the continuous, high-dimensional action space. We first propose a
clustering based long short-term memory (C-LTSM) approach to predict the number
of content requests using historical request information. This approach
exploits the correlation of the historical request information between
different files through clustering. Based on the predicted results, we then
propose a supervised deep deterministic policy gradient (SDDPG) approach. This
approach, on one hand, can learn the caching policy in continuous action space
by using the actor-critic architecture. On the other hand, it accelerates the
learning process by pre-training the actor network based on the solution of an
approximate problem that minimizes the per-slot cost. Real-world trace-based
numerical results show that the proposed prediction and caching policy using
deep learning outperform the considered existing methods.

quantum field theories should be regularized by sequences of quasi-physical
systems comprising a well defined number of the field's degrees of freedom. In
dependence on this number, each system backreacts autonomously and
self-consistently on the gravitational field. In this approach, the limit which
removes the regularization automatically generates the physically correct

an application, the results are used to elucidate the cosmological constant

further application concerns the thermodynamics of de Sitter space where the

applications, and using only 3D skeleton data to extract discriminative gait
features for person Re-ID is an emerging open topic. Existing methods either
adopt hand-crafted features or learn gait features by traditional supervised
learning paradigms. Unlike previous methods, we for the first time propose a
generic gait encoding approach that can utilize unlabeled skeleton data to
learn gait representations in a self-supervised manner. Specifically, we first
propose to introduce self-supervision by learning to reconstruct input skeleton
sequences in reverse order, which facilitates learning richer high-level
semantics and better gait representations. Second, inspired by the fact that
motion's continuity endows temporally adjacent skeletons with higher
correlations (""locality""), we propose a locality-aware attention mechanism that
encourages learning larger attention weights for temporally adjacent skeletons
when reconstructing current skeleton, so as to learn locality when encoding
gait. Finally, we propose Attention-based Gait Encodings (AGEs), which are
built using context vectors learned by locality-aware attention, as final gait
representations. AGEs are directly utilized to realize effective person Re-ID.
Our approach typically improves existing skeleton-based methods by 10-20%
Rank-1 accuracy, and it achieves comparable or even superior performance to
multi-modal methods with extra RGB or depth information. Our codes are

anti-social and economic restriction discourse more frequently articulates
rights and freedoms, based on ideas of inviolable rights to freedom of movement

activity over public health. Pro-social and economic restriction discourse less
frequently mentions rights and freedoms, instead supporting restrictions as
following state and medical advice and out of deference and respect to medical

largely through established political identity positions. It is suggested that
more attention is paid to discussions of balancing rights and freedoms in COVID

holes that point very close to our line of sight. Their emission is nonthermal
dominated and highly variable across the entire electromagnetic spectrum.
Relativistic magnetic reconnection has been proposed as the driver of particle
acceleration during blazar flares. While recent particle-in-cell simulations
have self-consistently studied the evolution of magnetic reconnection and
particle acceleration therein, the resulting radiation signatures have not been
systematically explored. In particular, the polarization signatures, which
directly reflect the characteristic strongly dynamical magnetic field evolution
during reconnection, have not been carefully investigated. In this paper, we
present a systematic study of radiation and polarization signatures arising
from magnetic reconnection in blazars, based on combined PIC and polarized
radiation transfer simulations with various physical parameters. We identify a
harder-when-brighter trend in the spectral evolution. Moreover,
higher-frequency bands tend to flare earlier than lower-frequency bands in the
synchrotron spectral component. Most importantly, polarization signatures
appear more variable with higher frequencies. We find that the temporal
polarization variations strongly depends on the guide field strength.
Specifically, reconnection with significant guide field component leads to very
high polarization degree that contradict to typical blazar observations, while
large polarization angle rotations are unique signatures of magnetic
reconnection between nearly anti-parallel magnetic field lines. These rotations
are at least $90^o$ and can extend to $>180^o$, and they may rotate in both
directions. These results imply that blazars that have shown large polarization
angle rotations intrinsically have more nearly anti-parallel magnetic field
morphology.

detection using the radial velocity method alone can be very challenging, since
the amplitude of the signals due to magnetic activity of such stars can be
orders of magnitude larger than those induced even by massive planets. We
observed the very young ($\sim$2 Myr) and very active star V830 Tau with the
HARPS-N spectrograph to independently confirm and characterise the previously
reported hot Jupiter V830 Tau b ($K_{\rm b}=68\pm11$ m/s; $m_{\rm b}sini_{\rm

$\sim$1 km/s radial velocity scatter clearly attributable to V830 Tau's
magnetic activity, we analysed radial velocities extracted with different
pipelines and modelled them using several state-of-the-art tools. We devised
injection-recovery simulations to support our results and characterise our
detection limits. The analysis of the radial velocities was aided by using
simultaneous photometric and spectroscopic diagnostics. Despite the high
quality of our HARPS-N data and the diversity of tests we performed, we could
not detect the planet V830 Tau b in our data and confirm its existence. Our
simulations show that a statistically-significant detection of the claimed
planetary Doppler signal is very challenging. Much as it is important to
continue Doppler searches for planets around young stars, utmost care must be
taken in the attempt to overcome the technical difficulties to be faced in
order to achieve their detection and characterisation. This point must be kept
in mind when assessing their occurrence rate, formation mechanisms and
migration pathways, especially without evidence of their existence from

Imitation learning directly learns policy based on data on the behavior of the

However, imitation learning tries to optimize policies based on deep

deep reinforcement learning based imitation learning also poses a crisis of

The electrostatic potential of a spacecraft, VS, is important for
the capabilities of in situ plasma measurements. Rosetta has been found to be
negatively charged during most of the comet mission and even more so in denser
plasmas. Aims. Our goal is to investigate how the negative VS correlates with
electron density and temperature and to understand the physics of the observed
correlation. Methods. We applied full mission comparative statistics of VS,
electron temperature, and electron density to establish VS dependence on cold
and warm plasma density and electron temperature. We also used
Spacecraft-Plasma Interaction System (SPIS) simulations and an analytical
vacuum model to investigate if positively biased elements covering a fraction
of the solar array surface can explain the observed correlations. Results.
Here, the VS was found to depend more on electron density, particularly with
regard to the cold part of the electrons, and less on electron temperature than
was expected for the high flux of thermal (cometary) ionospheric electrons.
This behaviour was reproduced by an analytical model which is consistent with
numerical simulations. Conclusions. Rosetta is negatively driven mainly by
positively biased elements on the borders of the front side of the solar panels
as these can efficiently collect cold plasma electrons. Biased elements
distributed elsewhere on the front side of the panels are less efficient at
collecting electrons apart from locally produced electrons (photoelectrons). To
avoid significant charging, future spacecraft may minimise the area of exposed
bias conductors or use a positive ground power system.

human poses, including bodies, hands and faces, in the wild. Achieving this
level of details is key for a number of applications that require understanding
the interactions of the people with each other or with the environment. The
main challenge is the lack of in-the-wild data with labeled whole-body 3D
poses. In previous work, training data has been annotated or generated for
simpler tasks focusing on bodies, hands or faces separately. In this work, we
propose to take advantage of these datasets to train independent experts for
each part, namely a body, a hand and a face expert, and distill their knowledge
into a single deep network designed for whole-body 2D-3D pose detection. In
practice, given a training image with partial or no annotation, each part
expert detects its subset of keypoints in 2D and 3D and the resulting
estimations are combined to obtain whole-body pseudo ground-truth poses. A
distillation loss encourages the whole-body predictions to mimic the experts'
outputs. Our results show that this approach significantly outperforms the same
whole-body model trained without distillation while staying close to the
performance of the experts. Importantly, DOPE is computationally less demanding
than the ensemble of experts and can achieve real-time performance. Test code

The
branching rate of each particle depends on its rank and is given by a function
$b$ defined on the unit interval. There is also a killing measure $D$ supported
on the unit interval as well. At branching times, a particle is chosen among
all particles to the left of the branching one by sampling its rank according
to $D$. The measure $D$ is allowed to have total mass less than one, which
corresponds to a positive probability of no killing. Between branching times,
particles perform independent Brownian Motions in the real line. This setting
includes several well known models like Branching Brownian Motion (BBM),
$N$-BBM, rank dependent BBM, and many others. We conjecture a scaling limit for
this class of processes and prove such a limit for a related class of

use the behavior of solutions of the limiting equation to prove the asymptotic

technology that can enable green Internet-of-Things deployments. The widespread
acceptance of this paradigm is limited by low Signal-to-Interference-Plus-Noise
Ratio (SINR) of the signal impinging on the receiver antenna due to the strong
direct path interference and unknown ambient signal. The adverse impact of
these two factors can be mitigated by using non-coherent multi-antenna
receivers, which is known to require higher SINR to reach Bit-Error-Rate (BER)
performance of coherent receivers. However, in literature, coherent receivers
for AmBC systems are little-studied because of unknown ambient signal, unknown
location of AmBC tags, and varying channel conditions. In this paper, a
coherent multi-antenna receiver, which does not require a prior information of
the ambient signal, for decoding Binary-Phase-shift-Keying (BPSK) modulated
signal is presented. The performance of the proposed receiver is compared with
the ideal coherent receiver that has a perfect phase information, and also with
the performance of non-coherent receiver, which assumes distributions for
ambient signal and phase offset caused by excess length of the backscatter
path. Comparative simulation results show the designed receiver can achieve the
same BER-performance of the ideal coherent receiver with 1-dB more SINR, which
corresponds to 5-dB or more gain with respect to non-coherent reception of
On-Off-Keying modulated signals. Variation of the detection performance with
the tag location shows that the coverage area is in the close vicinity of the
transmitter and a larger region around the receiver, which is consistent with
the theoretical results.

regions of human speech in digital signals such as audio and video. While VAD
is a necessary first step in many speech processing systems, it poses
challenges when there are high levels of ambient noise during the audio
recording. To improve the performance of VAD in such conditions, several
methods utilizing the visual information extracted from the region surrounding
the mouth/lip region of the speakers' video recording have been proposed. Even
though these provide advantages over audio-only methods, they depend on
faithful extraction of lip/mouth regions. Motivated by these, a new paradigm
for VAD based on the fact that respiration forms the primary source of energy
for speech production is proposed. Specifically, an audio-independent VAD
technique using the respiration pattern extracted from the speakers' video is
developed. The Respiration Pattern is first extracted from the video focusing
on the abdominal-thoracic region of a speaker using an optical flow based
method. Subsequently, voice activity is detected from the respiration pattern
signal using neural sequence-to-sequence prediction models. The efficacy of the
proposed method is demonstrated through experiments on a challenging dataset

map. When the two sensor modalities are significantly different, matching
becomes challenging. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep phase
correlation network (DPCN) to match heterogeneous sensor measurements. In DPCN,
the primary component is a differentiable correlation-based estimator that
back-propagates the pose error to learnable feature extractors, which addresses
the problem that there are no direct common features for supervision. Also, it
eliminates the exhaustive evaluation in some previous methods, improving
efficiency. With the interpretable modeling, the network is light-weighted and
promising for better generalization. We evaluate the system on both the
simulation data and Aero-Ground Dataset which consists of heterogeneous sensor
images and aerial images acquired by satellites or aerial robots. The results
show that our method is able to match the heterogeneous sensor measurements,
outperforming the comparative traditional phase correlation and other

It is essential to design and test mmWave 5G devices under various realistic

the performance. This requires emulating realistic dynamic mmWave channels in a
reproducible manner in laboratories, which is the goal of this paper. In this
contribution, we firstly illustrate the dominant-cluster(s) concept, where the
non-dominant clusters in the mmWave channels are pruned, for mmWave 5G devices
applying massive MIMO beamforming. This demonstrates the importance and
necessity to accurately emulate the mmWave channels at a cluster level rather
than the composite-channel level. Thus, an over-the-air (OTA) emulation
strategy for dynamic mmWave channels is proposed based on the concept of
dominant-cluster(s) in a sectored multiprobe anechoic chamber (SMPAC). The key
design parameters including the probe number and the angular spacing of probes
are investigated through comprehensive simulations. A cost-effective
switchcircuit is also designed for this purpose and validated in the

intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO systems. By
exploiting the low-rank nature of mmWave channels in the angular domains, we
propose a non-iterative Two-stage RIS-aided Channel Estimation (TRICE)
framework, where every stage is formulated as a multidimensional
direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation problem. As a result, our TRICE framework
is very general in the sense that any efficient multidimensional DOA estimation
solution can be readily used in every stage to estimate the associated channel
parameters. Numerical results show that the TRICE framework has a lower
training overhead and a lower computational complexity, as compared to
benchmark solutions.

enable an enclave to attest its identity (i.e., the enclave measurement, which
is the cryptographic hash of its initial code and data) to an enclave. To
verify that the attested identity is trusted, one enclave usually includes the
measurement of the enclave it trusts into its initial data in advance assuming
no trusted third parties are available during runtime to provide this piece of
information. However, when mutual trust between these two enclaves is required,
it is infeasible to simultaneously include into their own initial data the
other's measurements respectively as any change to the initial data will change
their measurements, making the previously included measurements invalid. In
this paper, we propose MAGE, a framework enabling a group of enclaves to
mutually attest each other without trusted third parties. Particularly, we
introduce a technique to instrument these enclaves so that each of them could
derive the others' measurements using information solely from its own initial
data. We also provide a prototype implementation based on Intel SGX SDK, to
facilitate enclave developers to adopt this technique.

instances. They provide a framework for handling uncertainty in databases, as
occurs due to data integration, noisy data, data from unreliable sources or
randomized processes. Most of the existing theory literature investigated
finite, tuple-independent PDBs (TI-PDBs) where the occurrences of tuples are
independent events. Only recently, Grohe and Lindner (PODS '19) introduced
independence assumptions for PDBs beyond the finite domain assumption. In the
finite, a major argument for discussing the theoretical properties of TI-PDBs
is that they can be used to represent any finite PDB via views. This is no
longer the case once the number of tuples is countably infinite. In this paper,
we systematically study the representability of infinite PDBs in terms of
TI-PDBs and the related block-independent disjoint PDBs.
  The central question is which infinite PDBs are representable as first-order
views over tuple-independent PDBs. We give a necessary condition for the
representability of PDBs and provide a sufficient criterion for
representability in terms of the probability distribution of a PDB. With
various examples, we explore the limits of our criteria. We show that
conditioning on first order properties yields no additional power in terms of
expressivity. Finally, we discuss the relation between purely logical and

enabling green communication amidst the continual development of the
Internet-of-things paradigm. Efforts have been put into backscatter signal
detection as the detection performance is limited by the low
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the signal at the receiver.
The low SINR can be improved by adopting a multi-antenna receiver. In this
paper, the optimum multi-antenna receiver that does not impose any constraints
on the types of binary modulation performed by the backscatter device and the
waveform used by the ambient source system is studied. The proposed receiver
owns a simple structure formed by two beamformers. Bit error rate (BER)
performances of the optimum receiver are derived under constant-amplitude
ambient signal and Gaussian-distributed ambient signal. Moreover, to facilitate
the implementation of the optimum receiver, a simplified receiver is proposed
and practical approximations to required beamformers are provided. The derived
optimum receiver avoids the complex direct path interference cancellation and
coherent reception, but exploits the fact that backscatter signal changes the
composite channel impinging at the receiver and the directivity of receiver
antenna array. Comparative simulation results show that the performance of the
optimum receiver achieves the same performance as the coherent receiver even
though it realizes non-coherent reception. The studied receivers provide high
flexibility for implementing simple and low-cost receivers in different AmBC
systems.

assessments by crowds versus experts to understand when and how ratings between
them differ. We gather a dataset of over 4,000 credibility assessments taken
from 2 crowd groups---journalism students and Upwork workers---as well as 2
expert groups---journalists and scientists---on a varied set of 50 news
articles related to climate science, a topic with widespread disconnect between
public opinion and expert consensus. Examining the ratings, we find differences
in performance due to the makeup of the crowd, such as rater demographics and
political leaning, as well as the scope of the tasks that the crowd is assigned
to rate, such as the genre of the article and partisanship of the publication.
Finally, we find differences between expert assessments due to differing expert
criteria that journalism versus science experts use---differences that may
contribute to crowd discrepancies, but that also suggest a way to reduce the
gap by designing crowd tasks tailored to specific expert criteria. From these
findings, we outline future research directions to better design crowd

mutual information that a set of source variables contains about a target
variable into basic pieces, the so called ""atoms of information"". Each atom
describes a distinct way in which the sources may contain information about the
target. In this paper we show, first, that the entire theory of partial
information decomposition can be derived from considerations of elementary
parthood relationships between information contributions. This way of
approaching the problem has the advantage of directly characterizing the atoms
of information, instead of taking an indirect approach via the concept of
redundancy. Secondly, we describe several intriguing links between PID and
formal logic. In particular, we show how to define a measure of PID based on
the information provided by certain statements about source realizations.
Furthermore, we show how the mathematical lattice structure underlying PID
theory can be translated into an isomorphic structure of logical statements
with a particularly simple ordering relation: logical implication. The
conclusion to be drawn from these considerations is that there are three
isomorphic ""worlds"" of partial information decomposition, i.e. three equivalent
ways to mathematically describe the decomposition of the information carried by
a set of sources about a target: the world of parthood relationships, the world
of logical statements, and the world of antichains that was utilized by
Williams and Beer in their original exposition of PID theory. We additionally
show how the parthood perspective provides a systematic way to answer a type of
question that has been much discussed in the PID field: whether a partial
information decomposition can be uniquely determined based on concepts other

spintronics that combines magnetism with optical physics and ultrafast
photonics. The experimental scheme of the field involves the use of femtosecond
laser pulses to trigger ultrafast spin and charge dynamics in bilayers composed
of ferromagnetic (FM) and non-magnetic (NM) thin films where the NM layer
features a strong spin-orbit coupling. The key technological and scientific
challenges of THz spintronic emitters is to increase their intensity and
frequency bandwidth. To achieve this the control of the source of the
radiation, namely the transport of the ultrafast spin current is required.
However, the transfer of a spin current from a FM to a NM layer is a highly
interface-sensitive effect. In this work we study the properties of the spin
current transport through the interface measuring the strength of the THz
emission and compare it to the effective spin mixing conductance, one of the
key concepts in the spin current transport through interfaces. The results show
an enhancement of the spin mixing conductance for interfaces with higher degree
of epitaxy similarly to the improvement of the THz emission. The
proportionality between spin mixing conductance and THz emission can define new
directions in engineering the emission of spintronic THz emitters.

first, the minimum amount of ERRs is determined in a pre-disaster planning

dispatch of pre-planned ERRs and PDA-DERs to minimize the impact of disasters
on customers, i.e., unserved energy for the entire restoration window. Compared
with existing restoration strategies using ERRs, the proposed approach is more
tractable since 1) in the pre-disaster stage, the needed EERs are determined
based on the prediction of energy shortage and disaster-induced damages using
machine learning-based algorithms (i.e., cost-sensitive-RFQRF for prediction of
outage customers, random forest for prediction of outage duration, and CART for
prediction of disaster-induced damages); 2) in the post-disaster stage, the
super-node approximation (SNA) and the convex hull relaxation (CHR) of
distribution networks are introduced to achieve the best trade-off between
computational burden and accuracy. Tests of the proposed approach on IEEE test
feeders demonstrated that a combination of SNA and CHR remarkably reduces the
solution time of the post-disaster restoration model.

components; i.e., no energy passes through the waveguide after the incoming
wave couples into the resonator. The transmission spectral characteristics
resulting from this phenomenon are highly advantageous for signal filtering,
switching, multiplexing, and sensing. In the present study, adopting an
elastic-wave platform, we introduce topological insulator (TI), a remarkable
achievement in condensed matter physics over the past decade, into a classical
waveguide-ring-resonator configuration. Along with basic similarities with
classical systems, a TI system has important differences and advantages, mostly
owing to the spin-momentum locked transmission states at the TI boundaries. As
an example, a two-port TI waveguide resonator can fundamentally eliminate
upstream reflections while completely retaining useful transmission spectral
characteristics, and maximize the energy in the resonator, with possible
applications being novel signal processing, gyro/sensing, lasering, energy
harvesting, and intense wave-matter interactions, using phonons, photons, or
even electrons. The present work further enhances the confidence of using
topological protection for practical device performance and functionalities,

two years several new results have been obtained, adding the classes of plane,
claw-free, and 3-connected tree-width 3 graphs to the list.
  In this paper, we regard a natural extension of Hamiltonian graphs: removing
a Hamiltonian cycle from a cubic graph leaves a perfect matching. Conversely,
removing a perfect matching $M$ from a cubic graph $G$ leaves a disjoint union
of cycles. Contracting these cycles yields a new graph $G_M$. The graph $G$ is
star-like if $G_M$ is a star for some perfect matching $M$, making Hamiltonian
graphs star-like. We extend the technique used to prove that Hamiltonian graphs
satisfy the 3-decomposition conjecture to show that 3-connected star-like
graphs satisfy it as well.

magnetic metamaterial, consisting of a one-dimensional array of split-ring
resonators, in the presence of correlated disorder in the resonant frequencies.
The computation of the average participation ratio (PR) reveals that on
average, the modes for the correlated disorder system are less localized than
in the uncorrelated case. The numerical computation of the mean square
displacement of an initially localized magnetic excitation for the correlated
case shows a substantial departure from the uncorrelated (Anderson-like) case.
A long-time asymptotic fit $\langle n^2\rangle \sim t^\alpha$ reveals that, for
the uncorrelated system $\alpha\sim 0$, while for the correlated case
$\alpha>0$, spanning a whole range of behavior ranging from localization to
super-diffusive behavior. The transmission coefficient of a plane wave across a
single magnetic dimer reveals the existence of well-defined regions in disorder
strength-magnetic coupling space, where unit transmission for some
wavevector(s) is possible. This implies, according to the random dimer model
(RDM) of Dunlap et al., a degree of mobility. A comparison between the
mobilities of the correlated SRR system and the RDM shows that the RDM model
has better mobility at low disorder while our correlated SRR model displays
better mobility at medium and large disorder.

nonconvex and nonsmooth, making the optimization problem quite challenging. We
give a detailed analytical treatment for the case of two masses, arguing that
the optimal parameter configuration approaches the flutter and divergence
boundaries of the stability region simultaneously. Furthermore, we conjecture
that this property holds for any number of masses, which in turn suggests a
simple formula for the maximal load interval for $n$ masses. This conjecture is
strongly supported by extensive computational results, obtained using the
recently developed open-source software package GRANSO (GRadient-based

an appropriate formulation of the nonsmooth stability constraint. We hope that
our work will provide a foundation for new approaches to classical

function (IMF) slope is bottom-heavy, i.e. they contain a larger fraction of
low-mass stars than the Milky Way. However, measurements of the IMF remain
challenging in unresolved galaxies because features in their observed spectra
are sensitive to a number of factors including the stellar age, metallicity,
and elemental abundances, in addition to the IMF. In this paper, we use new
high signal-to-noise IMACS (Magellan) spectra to study the elliptical shell
galaxy NGC 3923 at optical (3700-6600 Angstrom), and near-infrared (7900-8500
Angstrom) wavelengths, as a function of radius. We have undertaken a number of
independent approaches to better understand the uncertainties in our results.
1) We compare two different stellar population model libraries; 2) we undertake
spectral index fitting as well as full spectral fitting; 3) we have performed
simulations for which we a priori know the input IMF, and which closely match
our data; 4) we also investigate the effects of including a two-component,
rather than a single stellar population. We show that our results are sensitive
to the assumptions we make and to the methods we use. In addition, we evaluate
the accuracy and precision of our results based on simulated mock data. We find
some indication (although assumption-dependent) for a bottom-heavy IMF in the
mass-range 0.5-1.0 M_sun, while the IMF in the mass-range 0.08-0.5 M_sun
appears to be Milky-Way like and constant. Including near-infrared data to our
analysis gives consistent results, and improves the precision.

embodied in modern institutions. Although its political institutions proved
both resilient and adaptable, allowing it to incorporate diverse populations,
the Empire suffered from many internal conflicts. Indeed, most emperors died
violently, from assassination, suicide, or in battle. These internal conflicts
produced patterns in the length of time that can be identified by statistical
analysis. In this paper, we study the underlying patterns associated with the
reign of the Roman emperors by using statistical tools of survival data
analysis. We consider all the 175 Roman emperors and propose a new power-law
model with change points to predict the time-to-violent-death of the Roman
emperors. This model encompasses data in the presence of censoring and
long-term survivors, providing more accurate predictions than previous models.
Our results show that power-law distributions can also occur in survival data,

complex networks such as wireless sensors networks and online social networks.
Spectral clustering is one of the most commonly used algorithms for
graph-structured data (networks). However, the conventional spectral clustering
is inherently difficult to work with large-scale networks due to the fact that
it needs computationally expensive matrix manipulations. To deal with large
networks, in this paper, we propose an efficient graph clustering algorithm,
KCoreMotif, specifically for large networks by exploiting k-core decomposition
and motifs. The essential idea behind the proposed clustering algorithm is to
perform the efficient motif-based spectral clustering algorithm on k-core
subgraphs, rather than on the entire graph. More specifically, (1) we first
conduct the k-core decomposition of the large input network; (2) we then
perform the motif-based spectral clustering for the top k-core subgraphs; (3)
we group the remaining vertices in the rest (k-1)-core subgraphs into
previously found clusters; and finally obtain the desired clusters of the large
input network. To evaluate the performance of the proposed graph clustering
algorithm KCoreMotif, we use both the conventional and the motif-based spectral
clustering algorithms as the baselines and compare our algorithm with them for
18 groups of real-world datasets. Comparative results demonstrate that the
proposed graph clustering algorithm is accurate yet efficient for large
networks, which also means that it can be further used to evaluate the
intra-cluster and inter-cluster trusts on large networks.

here that local Lorentz invariance is implemented not by a combination of the
Levi-Civita connection and Cartan's tetrads known as the spin connection, but
by independent Lorentz bosons L_i that gauge the Lorentz group, that couple to
fermions like Yang-Mills fields, and that have their own Yang-Mills-like
action. A nonsingular 4 x 4 hermitian scalar field h is needed to make the
action of the Lorentz bosons invariant under local Lorentz transformations.
Lorentz bosons couple to fermion number and generate a spin-dependent static
potential that violates the weak equivalence principle. If a Higgs mechanism
makes them massive, then the static potential also violates the inverse-square
law. Experiments put upper bounds on the strength of such a potential for
masses m_L < 20 eV. These upper limits imply that Lorentz bosons, if they
exist, are nearly stable and contribute to dark matter.

history, as well as stressful life events during childhood and pregnancy were
evaluated at baseline. Early and late PPD were assessed at 8 weeks and 1 year
postpartum respectively, using DSM-5 criteria. Results: The prevalence of early
PPD was 8.3% (95%CI 7.3-9.3), and late PPD 12.9% (95%CI 11.5-14.2), resulting
in an 8-week cumulative incidence of 8.5% (95%CI 7.4-9.6) and a one-year

a neighborhood area network (NAN) consisting of a shared energy storage (SES)
provider, users with non-dispatchable energy generation, and an electricity
retailer. In a leader-follower Stackelberg game, the SES provider first
maximizes their revenue by setting a price signal and trading energy with the
grid. Then, by following the SES provider's actions, the retailer minimizes
social cost for the users, i.e., the sum of the total users' cost when they
interact with the SES and the total cost for supplying grid energy to the
users. A pricing strategy, which incorporates mechanism design, is proposed to
make the system incentive-compatible by rewarding users who disclose true
energy usage information. A unique Stackelberg equilibrium is achieved where
the SES provider's revenue is maximized and the user-level social cost is
minimized, which also rewards the retailer. A case study with realistic energy
demand and generation data demonstrates 28\%~-~45\% peak demand reduction of
the NAN, depending on the number of participating users, compared to a system
without SES. Simulation results confirm that the retailer can also benefit
financially, in addition to the SES provider and the users.

they are all passive in nature, i.e., simply act as air filters for the nasal

in which the wearable device is equipped with smart sensors and actuators to
both detect the presence of airborne pathogens in real time and take
appropriate action to mitigate the threat. The proposed approach is based on a
closed-loop control system that senses airborne particles of different sizes
close to the mask and then makes intelligent decisions to reduce their
concentrations. This paper presents a specific implementation of this concept
in which the on-board controller determines ambient air quality via a
commercial particulate matter sensor, and if necessary activates a
piezoelectric actuator that generates a mist spray to load these particles,
thus causing them to fall to the ground. The proposed system communicates with
the user via a smart phone application that provides various alerts, including
notification of the need to recharge and/or decontaminate the mask prior to
reuse. The application also enables a user to override the on-board control
system and manually control the mist generator if necessary. Experimental
results from a functional prototype demonstrate significant reduction in
airborne particulate counts near the mask when the active protection system is
enabled.

a violation of the no-slip assumption that have been adopted by the classical
fluid mechanics. To correct this mechanics for the fluid slip, various
approaches have been proposed to determine the slip boundary conditions.
However, these approaches have revealed contradictory results for a variety of
systems, and a debate on the mechanisms and the conditions of the fluid
slip/no-slip past solid surfaces is sustained for a long time. In this paper,
we establish the hybrid continuum-molecular modeling (HCMM) as a general
approach of modeling the fluid slip flow under the influence of excess
fluid-solid molecular interactions. This modeling approach postulates that
fluids flow over solid surfaces with/without slip depending on the difference
between the applied impulse on the fluid and a drag due to the excess
fluid-solid molecular interactions. In the HCMM, the Navier-Stokes equations
are corrected for the excess fluid-solid interactions. Measures of the
fluid-solid interactions are incorporated into the fluid viscosity. We
demonstrate that the correction of the fluid mechanics by the slip boundary
conditions is not an accurate approach, as the fluid-solid interactions would
impact the fluid internally. To show the effectiveness of the proposed HCMM, it
is implemented for water flow in nanotubes. The HCMM is validated by an
extensive comparison with over 90 cases of experiments and molecular dynamics
simulations of different fluid systems. We foresee that the hybrid
continuum-molecular modeling of the fluid slip flow will find many important
implementations in fluid mechanics.

introduces the contributions that we made to address these challenges from
three aspects. 1) Meta-learning model: In the context of representation
learning with e-commerce user behavior data, we propose a meta-learning
framework called the Meta-Profile Network, which extends the ideas of matching
network and relation network for knowledge transfer and fast adaptation; 2)
Encoding strategy: To keep high fidelity of large-scale long-term sequential
behavior data, we propose a time-heatmap encoding strategy that allows the
model to encode data effectively; 3) Deep network architecture: A multi-modal
model combined with multi-task learning architecture is utilized to address the
cross-domain knowledge learning and insufficient label problems. Moreover, we
argue that an industrial model should not only have good performance in terms
of accuracy, but also have better robustness and uncertainty performance under
extreme conditions. We evaluate the performance of our model with extensive

the disease caused by the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus is a significant global
challenge. Many individuals who become infected have pre-existing conditions

risk. COVID-19 patient comorbidities are likely to be informative about
individual risk of severe illness and mortality. Accurately determining how
comorbidities are associated with severe symptoms and mortality would thus
greatly assist in COVID-19 care planning and provision.
  Methods: To assess the interaction of patient comorbidities with COVID-19
severity and mortality we performed a meta-analysis of the published global
literature, and machine learning predictive analysis using an aggregated
COVID-19 global dataset.
  Results: Our meta-analysis identified chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), cardiovascular disease (CVD), type 2
diabetes, malignancy, and hypertension as most significantly associated with
COVID-19 severity in the current published literature. Machine learning
classification using novel aggregated cohort data similarly found COPD, CVD,
CKD, type 2 diabetes, malignancy and hypertension, as well as asthma, as the
most significant features for classifying those deceased versus those who
survived COVID-19. While age and gender were the most significant predictor of
mortality, in terms of symptom-comorbidity combinations, it was observed that
Pneumonia-Hypertension, Pneumonia-Diabetes and Acute Respiratory Distress
Syndrome (ARDS)-Hypertension showed the most significant effects on COVID-19
mortality.
  Conclusions: These results highlight patient cohorts most at risk of COVID-19

century. The disconnect between the wavefunction state vector and what is
observed in experimental apparati has had no shortage of explanations. But all

this letter, I present a novel interpretation called dynamic histories. I show
mathematically how quantum mechanics can be reinterpreted as deterministically
evolving dynamical world lines in a 5D universe. Quantum probabilities can be
then be reinterpreted as stemming from ignorance of the state of our own world
line. Meanwhile, the lack of observed superposition in experimental apparati is
explained in that we only live on a single history with a definite set of
properties. Hence, superposition is not an actual state of a particle but a
model of ignorance as in classical probability theory. This explains nonlocal
effects without superluminal communication. I also discuss how this relates to
5D Kaluza-Klein theory.

  Transformer",,,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","  Text classification has seen an increased use in both academic and industry
settings. Though rule based methods have been fairly successful, supervised
machine learning has been shown to be most successful for most languages, where
most research was done on English. In this article, the success of lexicon
analysis, support vector machines, and extreme gradient boosting for the task
of text classification and sentiment analysis are evaluated in Turkish and a
pretrained transformer based classifier is proposed, outperforming previous
methods for Turkish text classification. In the context of text classification,
all machine learning models proposed in the article are domain-independent and
do not require any task-specific modifications.
