level is a neural network. We identify two different types of dynamical degrees
of freedom: ""trainable"" variables (e.g. bias vector or weight matrix) and
""hidden"" variables (e.g. state vector of neurons). We first consider stochastic
evolution of the trainable variables to argue that near equilibrium their
dynamics is well approximated by Madelung equations (with free energy
representing the phase) and further away from the equilibrium by
Hamilton-Jacobi equations (with free energy representing the Hamilton's
principal function). This shows that the trainable variables can indeed exhibit
classical and quantum behaviors with the state vector of neurons representing
the hidden variables. We then study stochastic evolution of the hidden
variables by considering $D$ non-interacting subsystems with average state
vectors, $\bar{\bf x}^{1}$, ..., $\bar{\bf x}^{D}$ and an overall average state
vector $\bar{\bf x}^{0}$. In the limit when the weight matrix is a permutation
matrix, the dynamics of $\bar{\bf x}^{\mu}$ can be described in terms of
relativistic strings in an emergent $D+1$ dimensional Minkowski space-time. If
the subsystems are minimally interacting, with interactions described by a
metric tensor, then the emergent space-time becomes curved. We argue that the
entropy production in such a system is a local function of the metric tensor
which should be determined by the symmetries of the Onsager tensor. It turns
out that a very simple and highly symmetric Onsager tensor leads to the entropy
production described by the Einstein-Hilbert term. This shows that the learning
dynamics of a neural network can indeed exhibit approximate behaviors described
by both quantum mechanics and general relativity. We also discuss a possibility
that the two descriptions are holographic duals of each other.

Simultaneous Semantic Alignment Network (SSAN) to simultaneously exploit

transfer the correlation knowledge of source categorical prediction
distributions to target domain. Meanwhile, by leveraging target pseudo-labels,
a robust triplet-centroid alignment mechanism is explicitly applied to align

generative adversarial networks (GANs), it remains challenging to effectively
translate an image to a set of diverse images in multiple target domains using
a single pair of generator and discriminator. Existing I2I translation methods
adopt multiple domain-specific content encoders for different domains, where
each domain-specific content encoder is trained with images from the same
domain only. Nevertheless, we argue that the content (domain-invariance)
features should be learned from images among all of the domains. Consequently,
each domain-specific content encoder of existing schemes fails to extract the
domain-invariant features efficiently. To address this issue, we present a
flexible and general SoloGAN model for efficient multimodal I2I translation
among multiple domains with unpaired data. In contrast to existing methods, the
SoloGAN algorithm uses a single projection discriminator with an additional
auxiliary classifier and shares the encoder and generator for all domains.
Consequently, the SoloGAN can be trained effectively with images from all
domains such that the domain-invariance content representation can be
efficiently extracted. Qualitative and quantitative results over a wide range
of datasets against several counterparts and variants of the SoloGAN
demonstrate the merits of the method, especially for challenging I2I
translation datasets, i.e., datasets involving extreme shape variations or need
to keep the complex backgrounds unchanged after translations. Furthermore, we
demonstrate the contribution of each component in SoloGAN by ablation studies.

scheme for communication over the AWGN channel with noisy feedback, claimed to
be superior to all previous schemes in the literature. Deepcode's use of
nonlinear coding (via Deep Learning) has been inspired by known shortcomings
(Y.-H. Kim et al 2007) of linear feedback schemes. In 2014, we presented a
nonlinear feedback coding scheme based on a combination of the classical SK
scheme and modulo-arithmetic, using a small number of elementary operations
without any type of neural network. This Modulo-SK scheme has been omitted from
the performance comparisons made in the Deepcode paper, due to its use of
common randomness (dither), and in a later version since it was incorrectly
interpreted as a variable-length coding scheme. However, the dither in
Modulo-SK was used only for the standard purpose of tractable performance
analysis, and is not required in practice. In this short note, we show that a
fully-deterministic Modulo-SK (without dithering) can outperform Deepcode. For
example, to attain an error probability of 10^(-4) at rate 1/3 Modulo-SK
requires 3dB less feedback SNR than Deepcode. To attain an error probability of
10^(-6) with noiseless feedback, Deepcode requires 150 rounds of communication,
whereas Modulo-SK requires only 15 rounds, even if the feedback is noisy (with
27dB SNR).
  We further address the numerical stability issues of the original SK scheme
reported in the Deepcode paper, and explain how they can be avoided. We augment
this report with an online-available, fully-functional Matlab simulation for
both the classical and Modulo-SK schemes. Finally, note that Modulo-SK is by no
means claimed to be the best possible solution; in particular, using deep
learning in conjunction with modulo-arithmetic might lead to better designs,
and remains a fascinating direction for future research.

upper bounded by a function $f_{\mathrm{c}}$ that is inversely proportional to
the Hilbert space dimension. In fact, even if they share entanglement, the

local filtering, the teleportation fidelity can always be activated, i.e.,
boosted beyond $f_{\mathrm{c}}$. Here, for all dimensions larger than two, we
show that the teleportation power hidden in a subset of entangled two-qudit

separability, and thus their teleportation power is either above the classical

and without the Allee effect. Such a model describes the evolution of a
population under environmental stochastic fluctuations and is in the form of a
stochastic differential equation driven by multiplicative Gaussian noise. With
the help of the associated Fokker-Planck equation, we analyze the population
extinction probability and the probability of reaching a large population size
before reaching a small one. We further study the impact of the harvest rate,
noise intensity, and the Allee effect on population evolution. The analysis and
numerical experiments show that if the noise intensity and harvest rate are
small, the population grows exponentially, and upon reaching the carrying
capacity, the population size fluctuates around it. In the stochastic
logistic-harvest model without the Allee effect, when noise intensity becomes
small (or goes to zero), the stationary probability density becomes more acute
and its maximum point approaches one. However, for large noise intensity and
harvest rate, the population size fluctuates wildly and does not grow
exponentially to the carrying capacity. So as far as biological meanings are
concerned, we must catch at small values of noise intensity and harvest rate.
Finally, we discuss the biological implications of our results.

solve the model equation by discretizing the spatial derivatives using

illustrate a strategy to identify the natural frequencies of a plate using our

M105. PNe were identified on the basis of their bright [OIII]5007 AA emission
and the absence of a broad-band continuum. We compare the PN number density
profile with the galaxy surface-brightness profile decomposed into metallicity
components using published HST photometry in two halo fields. We identify 226
PNe candidates within a limiting magnitude of mlim = 28.1 from our
Subaru-SuprimeCam imaging, covering 67.6 kpc along the major axis of M105 and
the halos of NGC 3384 and NGC 3398. We find an excess of PNe at large radii
compared to the stellar surface brightness profile from broad-band surveys.
This excess is related to a variation in the luminosity-specific PN number
$\alpha$ with radius. The $\alpha$-parameter value of the extended halo is more
than 7 times higher than that of the inner halo. We also measure an increase in
the slope of the PN luminosity function at fainter magnitudes with radius. We
infer that the radial variation of the PN population properties is due to a
diffuse population of metal-poor stars ([M/H] < -1.0) following an exponential
profile, in addition to the M105 halo. The spatial coincidence between the
number density profile of these metal-poor stars and the increase in the
$\alpha$-parameter value with radius establishes the missing link between
metallicity and the post-AGB phases of stellar evolution. We estimate that the
total bolometric luminosity associated with the exponential IGL population is
2.04x10^9 Lsun as a lower limit, corresponding to an IGL fraction of 3.8%. This

many-body orbits in Fock space. A natural simplification of such sums is the
diagonal approximation, where the only terms that are retained are ones in
which each path is paired with a partner that carries the complex conjugate
weight. We identify the regime in which the diagonal approximation holds, and
the nature of the leading corrections to it. We focus on the behaviour of the
spectral form factor (SFF) and of matrix elements of local operators, averaged
over an ensemble of random circuits, making comparisons with the predictions of
random matrix theory (RMT) and the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis (ETH).
We show that properties are dominated at long times by contributions to orbit
sums in which each orbit is paired locally with a conjugate, as in the diagonal
approximation, but that in large systems these contributions consist of many
spatial domains, with distinct local pairings in neighbouring domains. The
existence of these domains is reflected in deviations of the SFF from RMT
predictions, and of matrix element correlations from ETH predictions;
deviations of both kinds diverge with system size. We demonstrate that our
physical picture of orbit-pairing domains has a precise correspondence in the
spectral properties of a transfer matrix that acts in the space direction to
generate the ensemble-averaged SFF. In addition, we find that domains of a
second type control non-Gaussian fluctuations of the SFF. These domains are
separated by walls which are related to the entanglement membrane, known to
characterise the scrambling of quantum information.

vision-based applications including aerial surveillance, search and rescue,
event recognition, urban and rural scene understanding.To the best of our
knowledge, no labeled dataset is available for MOR evaluation in UAV videos.
Therefore, in this paper, we introduce MOR-UAV, a large-scale video dataset for
MOR in aerial videos. We achieve this by labeling axis-aligned bounding boxes
for moving objects which requires less computational resources than producing
pixel-level estimates. We annotate 89,783 moving object instances collected
from 30 UAV videos, consisting of 10,948 frames in various scenarios such as
weather conditions, occlusion, changing flying altitude and multiple camera
views. We assigned the labels for two categories of vehicles (car and heavy

in UAV videos. Since, this is a first attempt for MOR in UAV videos, we present
16 baseline results based on the proposed framework over the MOR-UAV dataset
through quantitative and qualitative experiments. We also analyze the
motion-salient regions in the network through multiple layer visualizations.
The MOR-UAVNet works online at inference as it requires only few past frames.
Moreover, it doesn't require predefined target initialization from user.
Experiments also demonstrate that the MOR-UAV dataset is quite challenging.

Through these privacy frameworks, a number of privacy mechanisms have been
developed in literature. In practice, privacy mechanisms often need be modified
or adjusted to specific applications. Their privacy risks have to be
re-evaluated for different circumstances. Moreover, computing devices only
approximate continuous noises through floating-point computation, which is
discrete in nature. Privacy proofs can thus be complicated and prone to errors.
Such tedious tasks can be burdensome to average data curators. In this paper,
we propose an automatic verification technique for Pufferfish privacy. We use
hidden Markov models to specify and analyze discretized Pufferfish privacy
mechanisms. We show that the Pufferfish verification problem in hidden Markov

heterogeneous Gaussian environments are devised. The first architecture relies
on a cyclic optimization exploiting the Maximum Likelihood Approach in the
original data domain, whereas the second detector is a function of transformed
data which are normalized with respect to their energy and with the unknown
parameters estimated through an Expectation-Maximization-based alternate
procedure. The remaining two architectures are obtained by suitably combining
the estimation procedures and the detector structures previously devised.
Performance analysis, conducted on both simulated and measured data, highlights
that the architecture working in the transformed domain guarantees the constant
false alarm rate property with respect to the interference power variations and
a limited detection loss with respect to the other detectors, whose detection
thresholds nevertheless are very sensitive to the interference power.

recover an underlying reward of an external agent in closed-form analytically.
We further provide an accompanying class of sampling-based variants which do
not depend on a model of the environment. We show how to extend this class of
algorithms to continuous state-spaces via function approximation and how to
estimate a corresponding action-value function, leading to a policy as close as
possible to the policy of the external agent, while optionally satisfying a
list of predefined hard constraints. We evaluate the resulting algorithms
called Inverse Action-value Iteration, Inverse Q-learning and Deep Inverse
Q-learning on the Objectworld benchmark, showing a speedup of up to several
orders of magnitude compared to (Deep) Max-Entropy algorithms. We further apply
Deep Constrained Inverse Q-learning on the task of learning autonomous

transitional pulsar PSR J1023+0038 is ideal and unique for this purpose,
because this is the only millisecond pulsar for which the spin-down rate has
been measured in both accreting and non-accreting states. Here we infer, from

magnetospheric origin of observed $\gamma$-rays in the two states, that PSR
J1023+0038 should emit gravitational waves due to a permanent ellipticity of
the pulsar. The formalism also explains some other main observational aspects
of this source in a self-consistent way. As an example, our formalism naturally
infers the accretion disc penetration into the pulsar magnetosphere, and
explains the observed X-ray pulsations in the accreting state using the
standard and well-accepted scenario. This, in turn, infers the larger pulsar
spin-down power in the accreting state, which, in our formalism, explains the
observed larger $\gamma$-ray emission in this state. Exploring wide ranges of
parameter values of PSR J1023+0038, and not assuming an additional source of
stellar ellipticity in the accreting state, we find the misaligned mass
quadrupole moment of the pulsar in the range of $(0.92-1.88)\times10^{36}$ g

$\mathbf{A} x = b$ typically depend on the condition number of the matrix

reducing that condition number in a computationally inexpensive way. In this
paper, we revisit the decades-old problem of how to best improve $\mathbf{A}$'s
condition number by left or right diagonal rescaling. We make progress on this
problem in several directions.
  First, we provide new bounds for the classic heuristic of scaling
$\mathbf{A}$ by its diagonal values (a.k.a. Jacobi preconditioning). We prove
that this approach reduces $\mathbf{A}$'s condition number to within a
quadratic factor of the best possible scaling. Second, we give a solver for
structured mixed packing and covering semidefinite programs (MPC SDPs) which
computes a constant-factor optimal scaling for $\mathbf{A}$ in
$\widetilde{O}(\text{nnz}(\mathbf{A}) \cdot \text{poly}(\kappa^\star))$ time;
this matches the cost of solving the linear system after scaling up to a
$\widetilde{O}(\text{poly}(\kappa^\star))$ factor. Third, we demonstrate that a
sufficiently general width-independent MPC SDP solver would imply near-optimal
runtimes for the scaling problems we consider, and natural variants concerned

disks. These rings are likely caused by pressure bumps in the gas profile; a
small bump can induce a traffic jam-like pattern in the dust density, while a
large bump may halt radial dust drift entirely. The resulting increase in dust
concentration may trigger planetesimal formation by the streaming instability
(SI), as the SI itself requires some initial concentration. Here we present the
first 3D simulations of planetesimal formation in the presence of a pressure
bump modeled specifically after those observed by ALMA. In particular, we place
a pressure bump at the center of a large 3D shearing box, along with an initial
solid-to-gas ratio of $Z = 0.01$, and we include both particle back-reaction
and particle self-gravity. We consider both mm-sized and cm-sized particles
separately. For simulations with cm-sized particles, we find that even a small
pressure bump leads to the formation of planetesimals via the streaming
instability; a pressure bump does {\it not} need to fully halt radial particle
drift for the SI to become efficient. Furthermore, pure gravitational collapse
via concentration in pressure bumps (such as would occur at sufficiently high
concentrations and without the streaming instability) is not responsible for
planetesimal formation. For mm-sized particles, we find tentative evidence that
planetesimal formation does not occur. This result, if it holds up at higher
resolution and for a broader range of parameters, could put strong constraints
on where in protoplanetary disks planetesimals can form. Ultimately, however,
our results suggest that for cm-sized particles, planetesimal formation in
pressure bumps is an extremely robust process.

determining the extension of the ionized gas, characterizing the occurrence of
AGN-driven outflows, and linking the properties of such outflows with those of
the AGN. We use Adaptive Optics-assisted SINFONI observations to trace ionized
gas in the extended narrow line region using the [OIII]5007 line. We classify a
target as hosting an outflow if its non-parametric velocity of the [OIII] line,
$\mathrm{w_{80}}$, is larger than 600 km/s. We study the presence of extended
emission using dedicated point-spread function (PSF) observations, after
modelling the PSF from the Balmer lines originating from the Broad Line Region.
We detect outflows in all the Type-1 AGN sample based on the $\mathrm{w_{80}}$
value from the integrated spectrum, which is in the range 650-2700 km/s. There
is a clear positive correlation between $\mathrm{w_{80}}$ and the AGN
bolometric luminosity (99% correlation probability), but a weaker correlation
with the black hole mass (80% correlation probability). A comparison of the PSF
and the [OIII] radial profile shows that the [OIII] emission is spatially
resolved for $\sim$35% of the Type-1 sample and the outflows show an extension
up to $\sim$6 kpc. The relation between maximum velocity and the bolometric
luminosity is consistent with model predictions for shocks from an AGN driven
outflow. The escape fraction of the outflowing gas increase with the AGN
luminosity, although for most galaxies, this fraction is less than 10%.

machinery for studying a broad range of condensed matter phenomena. While the
non-relativistic effective description is sufficient for most of the
applications, it is interesting to consider special and general relativistic
extensions of such models. Here, we introduce a framework that allows us to
construct theories of continuous spin variables on a curved spacetime. Our
approach takes advantage of the results of the non-linear field space theory,
which shows how to construct compact phase space models, in particular for the
spherical phase space of spin. Following the methodology corresponding to a
bosonization of spin systems into the spin wave representations, we postulate a
representation having the form of the Klein-Gordon field. This representation
is equivalent to the semi-classical version of the well-known
Holstein-Primakoff transformation. The general-relativistic extension of the
spin wave representation is then performed, leading to the
general-relativistically motivated modifications of the Ising model coupled to
a transversal magnetic field. The advantage of our approach is its off-shell
construction, while the popular methods of coupling fermions to general
relativity usually depend on the form of Einstein field equations with matter.
Furthermore, we show equivalence between the considered spin system and the
Dirac-Born-Infeld type scalar field theory with a specific potential, which is
also an example of k-essence theory. Based on this, the cosmological
consequences of the introduced spin field matter content are preliminarily
investigated.

6.6$ and consists of at least three UV components that are surrounded by
Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission. Previous studies have suggested that it
may host an extreme ionising source. Here, we present deep integral field
spectroscopy of CR7 with VLT/MUSE. We measure extended emission with a similar
halo scale length as typical LAEs at $z\approx5$. CR7's Ly$\alpha$ halo is
clearly elongated along the direction connecting the multiple components,
likely tracing the underlying gas distribution. The Ly$\alpha$ emission
originates almost exclusively from the brightest UV component, but we also
identify a faint kinematically distinct Ly$\alpha$ emitting region nearby a
fainter component. Combined with new near-infrared data, the MUSE data show
that the rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW) is $\approx100$ {\AA}.
This is a factor four higher than the EW measured in low-redshift analogues
with carefully matched Ly$\alpha$ profiles (and thus arguably HI column
density), but this EW can plausibly be explained by star formation. Alternative
scenarios requiring AGN powering are also disfavoured by the narrower and
steeper Ly$\alpha$ spectrum and much smaller IR to UV ratio compared to
obscured AGN in other Ly$\alpha$ blobs. CR7's Ly$\alpha$ emission, while
extremely luminous, resembles the emission in more common LAEs at lower
redshifts very well and is likely powered by a young metal poor starburst.

relations, due to particle-hole symmetry and unitarity of the scattering
matrix. However, experimental data often exhibits deviations from these

mechanism that leads to conductance asymmetries without quasiparticle
poisoning. In particular, we investigate the effects of finite bias and include
the voltage dependence in the tunnel barrier transparency, finding significant
conductance asymmetries for realistic device parameters. It is important to
identify the physical origin of conductance asymmetries: in contrast to other
possible mechanisms such as quasiparticle poisoning, finite-bias effects are
not detrimental to the performance of a topological qubit. To that end we
identify features that can be used to experimentally determine whether
finite-bias effects are the source of conductance asymmetries.

distinct symmetry patterns at zero temperature is one of the foundations of
modern quantum many-body physics. In this paper we demonstrate that the
existence of a 2D topological phase transition between a higher-order
topological insulator (HOTI) and a trivial Mott insulator with the same
symmetry eludes this paradigm. We present a theory of this quantum critical
point (QCP) driven by the fluctuations and percolation of the domain walls
between a HOTI and a trivial Mott insulator region. Due to the spinon zero
modes that decorate the rough corners of the domain walls, the fluctuations of
the phase boundaries trigger a spinon-dipole hopping term with fracton
dynamics. Hence we find the QCP is characterized by a critical dipole liquid
theory with subsystem $U(1)$ symmetry and the breakdown of the area law
entanglement entropy which exhibits a logarithmic enhancement: $L \ln(L)$.
Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we analyze the
dipole stiffness together with structure factor at the QCP which provide strong
evidence of a critical dipole liquid with a Bose surface. These numerical
signatures further support the fracton dynamics of the QCP, and suggest a new
paradigm for 2D quantum criticality proximate to a topological phase.

communication is restricted between neighbors. A line of recent research in
this area focuses on improving both computation and communication complexities.
The methods SSDA and MSDA \cite{scaman2017optimal} have optimal communication
complexity when the objective is smooth and strongly convex, and are simple to
derive. However, they require solving a subproblem at each step. We propose new
algorithms that save computation through using (stochastic) gradients and saves
communications when previous information is sufficiently useful. Our methods
remain relatively simple -- rather than solving a subproblem, they run Katyusha
for a small, fixed number of steps from the latest point. An easy-to-compute,
local rule is used to decide if a worker can skip a round of communication.
Furthermore, our methods provably reduce communication and computation
complexities of SSDA and MSDA. In numerical experiments, our algorithms achieve
significant computation and communication reduction compared with the
state-of-the-art.

find acceptable. Many approval voting situations can be modeled geometrically,
and thus geometric concepts such as the piercing number have a natural
interpretation. In this paper, we explore piercing numbers in the setting where
voter preferences can be modeled by congruent arcs on a circle -- i.e., in
fixed-length circular societies. Given a number of voters and the length of the
voter preference arcs, we give bounds on the possible piercing number of the
society. Further, we explore which piercing numbers are more likely.
Specifically, under the assumption of uniformly distributed voter preference
arcs, we determine the probability distribution of the piercing number of
societies in which the length of the arcs is sufficiently small. We end with
simulations that give estimated probabilities of piercing number for societies
with larger voter preference arcs.

that the surface of P can be reshaped to a homothet of Q by a finite sequence

vertex and sutures the digon closed. One phrasing of this result is that, if Q
can be ""sculpted"" from P by a series of slices with planes, then Q can be
tailored from P. And there is a sense in which tailoring is finer than
sculpting in that P may be tailored to polyhedra that are not achievable by
sculpting P. It is an easy corollary that, if S is the surface of any convex
body, then any convex polyhedron P may be tailored to approximate a homothet of
S as closely as desired. So P can be ""whittled"" to e.g., a sphere S.
  Another main result achieves the same reshaping, but by excising more
complicated shapes we call ""crests,"" still each enclosing one vertex. Reversing
either digon-tailoring or crest-tailoring leads to proofs that any Q inside P
can be enlarged to P by cutting Q and inserting and sealing surface patches.
  One surprising corollary of these results is that, for Q a subset of P, we
can cut-up Q into pieces and paste them non-overlapping onto an isometric
subset of P. This can be viewed as a form of ""unfolding"" Q onto P.

Euclidean measures of fit provide weaker discriminating power. To surmount
these issues, we propose to modify the convex clustering objective so that
feature weights are optimized jointly with the centroids. The resulting problem
becomes biconvex, and as such remains well-behaved statistically and
algorithmically. In particular, we derive a fast algorithm with closed form

analysis implies consistency of the proposed estimator. Biconvex clustering
performs feature selection throughout the clustering task: as the learned
weights change the effective feature representation, pairwise affinities can be
updated adaptively across iterations rather than precomputed within a dubious

showing that our method effectively addresses the challenges of dimensionality
while reducing dependence on carefully tuned heuristics typical of existing
approaches.

can cause a ML model to err. In this work we extend the idea of ""adversarial
perturbations"" to the space of model weights, specifically to inject backdoors
in trained DNNs, which exposes a security risk of using publicly available
trained models. Here, injecting a backdoor refers to obtaining a desired
outcome from the model when a trigger pattern is added to the input, while
retaining the original model predictions on a non-triggered input. From the
perspective of an adversary, we characterize these adversarial perturbations to
be constrained within an $\ell_{\infty}$ norm around the original model
weights. We introduce adversarial perturbations in the model weights using a
composite loss on the predictions of the original model and the desired trigger
through projected gradient descent. We empirically show that these adversarial
weight perturbations exist universally across several computer vision and
natural language processing tasks. Our results show that backdoors can be
successfully injected with a very small average relative change in model weight

gravitational waves (GWs) able to be detected by ground-based interferometric
detectors. The event GW170817 was the first observed in the gravitational and
electromagnetic spectra, showing through this joint analysis a certain
compatibility with the models of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) to explain the
signature of this system. Due to the intense magnetic fields of the neutron
stars, the plasma magnetosphere stays strongly magnetized and the propagation
of the GW through plasma can excite magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes such as
Alfv\'en and magnetosonic waves. The MHD modes carry energy and momentum
through the plasma, suggesting a mechanism to accelerate the matter during the
coalescence of the binaries, explaining some characteristics of the fireball
model of the sGRBs. We present a semianalytical formalism to determine the
energy transferred by the GW-MHD interaction during the inspiral phase of the
stars. Using the inferred physical parameters for GW170817, we show that the
energy in the plasma can reach maximum value $\sim 10^{35}\,{\rm J}$ ($\sim
10^{32}\,{\rm J}$) for the Alfv\'en mode (magnetosonic mode) if the angle
formed between the background magnetic field and the GW propagation direction
is $\theta = \pi / 4$. Particularly, for $\theta = \pi / 2$ only the
magnetosonic mode is in coherence with the GWs. In this case, the excited
energy in the plasma reaches maximum value $\sim 10^{36} {\rm J}$. If the
magnetic field on the surface of the progenitors of the event GW170817 was
$\sim 2\times 10^{9}\,{\rm T}$ then energies comparable to those inferred for

data-structure for this problem preprocesses $I$ into a data-structure such
that the LCS of a set of query strings $Q$ with the strings of $I$ can be
computed faster. Since the problem is NP-hard for arbitrary $k$, we allow an

the approximation version of the problem with an extra input $m$, which is the
length of the regular expression (regex) that describes the input, and the
approximation factor is the logarithm of the number of possibilities in the

numerical ""scores"" to all individuals in the full population such that similar
individuals get similar scores; matching via propensity scores or appropriate
covariates is common, for example. Given such scores, individuals with similar
scores may or may not attain similar outcomes independent of the individuals'
memberships in the subpopulation. The traditional graphical methods for
visualizing inequities are known as ""reliability diagrams"" or ""calibrations
plots,"" which bin the scores into a partition of all possible values, and for
each bin plot both the average outcomes for only individuals in the
subpopulation as well as the average outcomes for all individuals; comparing
the graph for the subpopulation with that for the full population gives some
sense of how the averages for the subpopulation deviate from the averages for
the full population. Unfortunately, real data sets contain only finitely many
observations, limiting the usable resolution of the bins, and so the
conventional methods can obscure important variations due to the binning.
Fortunately, plotting cumulative deviation of the subpopulation from the full
population as proposed in this paper sidesteps the problematic coarse binning.
The cumulative plots encode subpopulation deviation directly as the slopes of
secant lines for the graphs. Slope is easy to perceive even when the constant
offsets of the secant lines are irrelevant. The cumulative approach avoids
binning that smooths over deviations of the subpopulation from the full
population. Such cumulative aggregation furnishes both high-resolution
graphical methods and simple scalar summary statistics (analogous to those of
Kuiper and of Kolmogorov and Smirnov used in statistical significance testing
for comparing probability distributions).

process develops. We frame these problems as resource allocation problems with
fixed budgets, and analyze a suite of potential policies. Due to the complexity

game on the so-called expected network exposure admits a Nash equilibrium. In
both the curing and initialization scenarios, we introduce heuristic policies

Ices were then annealed to higher temperatures to study their thermal

secondary probe of molecular synthesis to better identify the physical and

N2 ices, respectively. Energetic processing of an O2:N2 = 1:1 ice mixture leads
to the formation of ozone along with a series of nitrogen oxides. The electron

tensions. To this end, we modify the CLASS Boltzmann code to create
phenomenological amplitudes, similar to the lensing amplitude parameter $A_L$,
for the Sachs-Wolfe, Doppler, early Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (eISW), and
Polarization contributions to the CMB temperature anisotropy, and then we
include these additional amplitudes in fits to the Planck TT power spectrum. We
find that allowing one of these amplitudes to vary at a time results in little
improvement over $\Lambda$CDM alone suggesting that each of these physical
effects are being correctly accounted for given the current level of precision.
Further, we find that the only pair of phenomenological amplitudes that results
in a significant improvement to the fit to Planck temperature data results from
varying the amplitudes of the Sachs-Wolfe and Doppler effects simultaneously.
However, we show that this model is really just refinding the $\Lambda$CDM +
$A_L$ solution. We test adding our phenomenological amplitudes as well as
$N_{\textrm{eff}}$, $Y_{\textrm{He}}$, and $n_{\textrm{run}}$ to $\Lambda$CDM +
$A_L$ and find that none of these model extensions provide significant
improvement over $\Lambda$CDM + $A_L$ when fitting Planck temperature data.
Finally, we quantify the contributions of both the eISW effect and lensing on
the constraint of the physical matter density from Planck temperature data by
allowing the phenomenological amplitude from each effect to vary. We find that
these effects play a relatively small role (the uncertainty increases by
$3.5\%$ and $16\%$ respectively) suggesting that the overall photon envelope

solution of the 3D compressible Navier-Stokes system at all Mach numbers. We
propose a cell-centered discretization of the governing equations that splits
the fluxes into a fast and a slow scale part, that are treated implicitly and
explicitly, respectively. A novel semi-implicit discretization is proposed for
the kinetic energy as well as the enthalpy fluxes in the energy equation, hence
avoiding any need of iterative solvers. The implicit discretization yields an
elliptic equation on the pressure that can be solved for both ideal gas and
general equation of state (EOS). A nested Newton method is used to solve the
mildly nonlinear system for the pressure in case of nonlinear EOS. High order
in time is granted by implicit-explicit (IMEX) time stepping, whereas a novel
CWENO technique efficiently implemented in a dimension-by-dimension manner is
developed for achieving high order in space for the discretization of explicit
convective and viscous fluxes. A quadrature-free finite volume solver is then
derived for the high order approximation of numerical fluxes. Central schemes
with no dissipation of suitable order of accuracy are finally employed for the
numerical approximation of the implicit terms. Consequently, the CFL-type
stability condition on the maximum admissible time step is based only on the
fluid velocity and not on the sound speed, so that the novel schemes work
uniformly for all Mach numbers. Convergence and robustness of the proposed
method are assessed through a wide set of benchmark problems involving low and
high Mach number regimes, as well as inviscid and viscous flows.

Reed--Solomon (RS) codes. Such an algorithm was initially presented by Wu (IEEE
Trans. IT, Jan. 2012), building on properties of the Berlekamp--Massey (BM)
algorithm. Wu devised a fast polynomial-update algorithm to construct the
error-locator polynomial (ELP) as the solution of a certain linear-feedback
shift register (LFSR) synthesis problem. This results in a conceptually
complicated algorithm, divided into $8$ subtly different cases. Moreover, Wu's
polynomial-update algorithm is not immediately suitable for working with
vectors of evaluations. Therefore, complicated modifications were required in
order to achieve a true ""one-pass"" Chase decoding algorithm, that is, a Chase
decoding algorithm requiring $O(n)$ operations per modified coordinate, where
$n$ is the RS code length.
  The main result of the current paper is a conceptually simple syndrome-based
fast Chase decoding of RS codes. Instead of developing a theory from scratch,
we use the well-established theory of Groebner bases for modules over
$\mathbb{F}_q[X]$ (where $\mathbb{F}_q$ is the finite field of $q$ elements,
for $q$ a prime power). The basic observation is that instead of Wu's LFSR
synthesis problem, it is much simpler to consider ""the right"" minimization
problem over a module. The solution to this minimization problem is a simple
polynomial-update algorithm that avoids syndrome updates and works seamlessly
with vectors of evaluations. As a result, we obtain a conceptually simple
algorithm for one-pass Chase decoding of RS codes. Our algorithm is general
enough to work with any algorithm that finds a Groebner basis for the solution
module of the key equation as the initial algorithm (including the Euclidean
algorithm), and it is not tied only to the BM algorithm.

scattering feature is detected with very high statistical significance at a
centroid energy of $E_{\rm cyc}=90.32_{-0.28}^{+0.32}$ keV, for the reference
continuum and line models, HIGHECUT and GABS respectively. Detection is very
robust with respect to different continuum models. The line energy is
significantly higher than what suggested from previous observations, which
provided very marginal evidence for the line. This establishes a new record for

forecasting. Specifically, we propose 1) a novel 4D higher-order recurrent

decomposition to capture higher-order space-time correlations, and 3) to
incorporate prior physic knowledge that is provided from domain experts by
informing the learning in latent space. The advantage of our proposed method is
clear: constrained by physical laws, it simultaneously learns good
representations for frame dependencies (both short-term and long-term
high-level dependency) and inter-hierarchical relations within each time frame.
Experiments on geospatial data collected from the GoM demonstrate that
PITT-ConvLSTM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in forecasting the

compressive sensing (CS). We formulate the reconstruction as a nonconvex
problem that can be decomposed into two subproblems. They can be solved either
separately via the standard approach or jointly via the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM). Compared to previous CS-based approaches that
only apply sparse regularization on the spin density $\boldsymbol X_0$ and the
relaxation rate $\boldsymbol R_2^*$, our formulation enforces additional sparse
priors on the $T_2^*$-weighted images at multiple echoes to improve the
reconstruction performance. We performed convergence analysis of the proposed
algorithm, evaluated its performance on in vivo data, and studied the effects
of different sampling schemes. Experimental results showed that the proposed
joint-recovery approach generally outperforms the state-of-the-art method,
especially in the low-sampling rate regime, making it a preferred choice to
perform fast 3D $T_2^*$ mapping in practice. The framework adopted in this work
can be easily extended to other problems arising from MR or other imaging
modalities with non-linearly coupled variables.

However, neural synthesis methods still struggle to reproduce large scale

first introduce a simple multi-resolution framework that efficiently accounts
for long-range dependency. Then, we show that additional statistical
constraints further improve the reproduction of textures with strong
regularity. This can be achieved by constraining both the Gram matrices of a
neural network and the power spectrum of the image. Alternatively one may
constrain only the autocorrelation of the features of the network and drop the
Gram matrices constraints. In an experimental part, the proposed methods are
then extensively tested and compared to alternative approaches, both in an
unsupervised way and through a user study. Experiments show the interest of the
multi-scale scheme for high resolution textures and the interest of combining
it with additional constraints for regular textures.

regulating musical continuity and closure. Converging measures have established
the psychological reality of tonality as a cognitive schema raising distinct
expectancy for both adults and children. However, while tonal expectations were
associated with emotion in adults, little is known about the tonality emotional
effects in children. Here we examine whether children associate levels of tonal
closure with emotional valence, whether such associations are age dependent,
and how they interact with other musical dimensions. 52 children, aged 7, 11,
listened to chord progressions implying closure followed by a probe tone.
Probes could realize closure (tonic note), violate it mildly (unstable diatonic
note) or extremely (out of key note). Three timbres (piano, guitar, woodwinds)
and three pitch heights were used for each closure level. Stimuli were
described to participants as exchanges between two children (chords, probe).
Participants chose one of two emojis, suggesting positive or negative emotions,
as representing the 2nd child response. A significant effect of tonal closure
was found, with no interactions with age, instrument, or pitch height. Results
suggest that tonality, a non referential cognitive schema, affects children

musical dimensions.

the data source before raw data from privacy-sensitive and performance-critical
applications is transferred to a cloud data center. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)
are one class of applications that are reported to benefit from collaboratively
computing between the edge and the cloud. A DNN is partitioned such that
specific layers of the DNN are deployed onto the edge and the cloud to meet
performance and privacy objectives. However, there is limited understanding of:
(a) whether and how evolving operational conditions (increased CPU and memory
utilization at the edge or reduced data transfer rates between the edge and the
cloud) affect the performance of already deployed DNNs, and (b) whether a new
partition configuration is required to maximize performance. A DNN that adapts
to changing operational conditions is referred to as an 'adaptive DNN'. This
paper investigates whether there is a case for adaptive DNNs in edge computing
by considering three questions: (i) Are DNNs sensitive to operational
conditions? (ii) How sensitive are DNNs to operational conditions? (iii) Do
individual or a combination of operational conditions equally affect DNNs? (iv)
Is DNN partitioning sensitive to hardware architectures on the cloud/edge? The
exploration is carried out in the context of 8 pre-trained DNN models and the
results presented are from analyzing nearly 8 million data points. The results
highlight that network conditions affects DNN performance more than CPU or
memory related operational conditions. Repartitioning is noted to provide a
performance gain in a number of cases, but a specific trend was not noted in
relation to its correlation to the underlying hardware architecture.
Nonetheless, the need for adaptive DNNs is confirmed.

this paper, we use mimicked Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies at $z=5.7$ to identify
protoclusters in the MultiDark galaxies, which are populated by applying three
different semi-analytic models to the 1 $Gpc h^{-1}$ MultiDark Planck2
simulation. To compare with observational results, we extend the criterion 1 (a
Ly$\alpha$ luminosity limited sample), to criterion 2 (a match to the observed
mean galaxy number density). To further statistically study the finding
efficiency of this method, we enlarge the identified protocluster sample
(criterion 3) to about 3500 at $z=5.7$ and study their final mass distribution.
The number of overdense regions and their selection probability depends on the
semi-analytic models and strongly on the three selection criteria (partly by
design). The protoclusters identified with criterion 1 are associated with a
typical final cluster mass of $2.82\pm0.92 \times 10^{15} M_\odot$ which is in
agreement with the prediction (within $\pm 1 \sigma$) of an observed massive
protocluster at $z=5.7$. Identifying more protoclusters allows us to
investigate the efficiency of this method, which is more suitable for
identifying the most massive clusters: completeness ($\mathbb{C}$) drops
rapidly with decreasing halo mass. We further find that it is hard to have a
high purity ($\mathbb{P}$) and completeness simultaneously.

non-communicative cooperative game (such as a mutual search) are called
""Schelling points."" It is noteworthy, therefore, that when developing his
eponymous units, Planck called them ""natural"" because they ""remain meaningful

apply Planck's suggestion in the context of Schelling points in SETI with a
""Planck Frequency Comb,"" constructed by multiplying the Planck energy by
integer powers of the fine structure constant. This comb includes a small
number of frequencies in regions of the electromagnetic spectrum where laser
and radio SETI typically operates. Searches might proceed and individual teeth
in the comb, or at many teeth at once, across the electromagnetic spectrum.
Indeed, the latter strategy can be additionally justified by the transmitter's
desire to signal at many frequencies at once, to improve the chances that the
receiver will guess one of them correctly. There are many arbitrary and
anthropocentric choices in this comb's construction, and indeed one can
construct several different frequency combs with only minor and arbitrary
modifications. This suggests that it may be fruitful to search for signals
arriving in frequency combs of arbitrary spacing. And even though the
frequencies suggested here are only debatably ""better"" than others proposed,
the addition of the Planck Frequency Comb to the list of ""magic frequencies""
can only help searches for extraterrestrial beacons.

significant challenge to visual understanding. One common solution is to
directly model certain intrinsic structures, e.g., using landmarks. However, it
then becomes non-trivial to build effective deep models, especially when the
underlying non-Euclidean grid is irregular and coarse. Recent deep models using
graph convolutions provide an appropriate framework to handle such
non-Euclidean data, but many of them, particularly those based on global graph
Laplacians, lack expressiveness to capture local features required for
representation of signals lying on the non-Euclidean grid. The current paper
introduces a new type of graph convolution with learnable low-rank local
filters, which is provably more expressive than previous spectral graph
convolution methods. The model also provides a unified framework for both
spectral and spatial graph convolutions. To improve model robustness,
regularization by local graph Laplacians is introduced. The representation
stability against input graph data perturbation is theoretically proved, making
use of the graph filter locality and the local graph regularization.
Experiments on spherical mesh data, real-world facial expression
recognition/skeleton-based action recognition data, and data with simulated

have assumed that: (i) either the gravitational constant, G, is a function of
distance (scale): G = G(r), or, (ii) the gravitational-to-inertial mass ratio,
mg/mi, is a function of distance (scale): f(r). We have used a linear
approximation of each function, from which two new parameters appeared that
have to be determined: G1, the first-order coefficient of gravitational
coupling, and C1, the first-order coefficient of gravitational-to-inertial mass
ratio. In the current part of this research, we have generated simplified
theoretical rotation curves for some hypothetical galaxies by varying the
parameters. We have concluded that our model gives a qualitatively and
quantitatively acceptable behavior of the galactic rotation curves for some
values of these parameters. The values of the 1st-order coefficients that give
quantitatively acceptable description of galactic rotation curves are: G1
between around 10^-31 to 10^-30 m^2 s^-2 kg^-1; and, C1 between 10^-21 to
10^-20 m^-1. Furthermore, our model implies the existence of a critical
distance at which the MOND effects become significant rather than a critical
acceleration. In fact, Milgrom's MOND converges with our model if the critical
acceleration is not a constant but a linear function of the galactic baryonic
mass.

Majorana boundary modes of the Kitaev honeycomb model. We argue that for the
time-reversal invariant case the residual low-temperature entropy is the
primary thermodynamic signature of these Majorana edge modes, and verify using
large-scale Monte Carlo simulations that this residual entropy is present in
the full Kitaev model. When time-reversal symmetry is broken, the Majorana edge
modes are potentially observable in more direct thermodynamic measurements such
as the specific heat, though only at temperatures well below the bulk gap. %
Second, we study the energetics, and the corresponding thermodynamic
signatures, of the flux excitations in the Kitaev model. Specifically, we study
the flux interactions on both cylinder and torus geometries numerically, and
quantify their impact on the thermodynamics of the Kitaev spin liquid by using
a polynomial fit for the average flux energy as a function of flux density and
extrapolating it to the thermodynamic limit. By comparing this model to Monte

can struggle with issues of robustness, failing catastrophically when the

this by adding worst-case adversarial noise to the dynamics and constructing
the noise distribution as the solution to a zero-sum minimax game. However,
existing work on learning solutions to the Robust RL formulation has primarily
focused on training a single RL agent against a single adversary. In this work,
we demonstrate that using a single adversary does not consistently yield
robustness to dynamics variations under standard parametrizations of the
adversary; the resulting policy is highly exploitable by new adversaries. We
propose a population-based augmentation to the Robust RL formulation in which
we randomly initialize a population of adversaries and sample from the
population uniformly during training. We empirically validate across robotics
benchmarks that the use of an adversarial population results in a more robust
policy that also improves out-of-distribution generalization. Finally, we
demonstrate that this approach provides comparable robustness and
generalization as domain randomization on these benchmarks while avoiding a
ubiquitous domain randomization failure mode.

invariance is related to boundary conditions on the surface defects located at

associated with each arc. Here we consider an additional parameter associated
with each arc, a measure such as the time required to select the arc. MPTs are
often used as models of tasks. Each vertex represents a process and an arc
descending from a vertex represents selection of an outcome of the process. A
source vertex represents processing that begins when a stimulus is presented
and a terminal vertex represents making a response. Responses are partitioned
into classes. An experimental factor selectively influences a vertex if
changing the level of the factor changes parameter values on arcs descending
from that vertex and on no others. Earlier work shows that if each of two
experimental factors selectively influences a different vertex in an arbitrary
MPT it is equivalent for the factors to one of two relatively simple MPTs.
Which of the two applies depends on whether the two selectively influenced
vertices are ordered by the factors or not. A special case, the Standard Binary
Tree for Ordered Processes, arises if the vertices are so ordered and the
factor selectively influencing the first vertex changes parameter values on
only two arcs descending from that vertex. Here we derive necessary and
sufficient conditions for the probability and measure associated with a
particular response class to be accounted for by this special case. Parameter
values are not unique and we give admissible transformations for transforming
one set of parameter values to another. When an experiment with two factors is
conducted, the number of observations and parameters to be estimated depend on
the number of levels of each factor; we provide degrees of freedom.

lattice based cryptography, allowing one to establish cryptography on the
hardness of well-studied computational problems. However, schemes based on LWE
are often impractical, so Ring LWE was introduced as a form of `structured'
LWE, trading off a hard to quantify loss of security for an increase in
efficiency by working over a well chosen ring. Another popular variant, Module
LWE, generalizes this exchange by implementing a module structure over a ring.
In this work, we introduce a novel variant of LWE over cyclic algebras (CLWE)
to replicate the addition of the ring structure taking LWE to Ring LWE by
adding cyclic structure to Module LWE. The proposed construction is both more
efficient than Module LWE and conjecturally more secure than Ring LWE, the best
of both worlds. We show that the security reductions expected for an LWE
problem hold, namely a reduction from certain structured lattice problems to
the hardness of the decision variant of the CLWE problem. As a contribution of
theoretic interest, we view CLWE as the first variant of Ring LWE which
supports non-commutative multiplication operations. This ring structure
compares favorably with Module LWE, and naturally allows a larger message space

measurement is made of the measured voltage vs. base temperature for a fixed
evaporation rate, direct extraction of the material's $C_p$ can be made,
leaving only the sample radius of curvature as an input parameter. The method
is applied to extract $F_E$ from a previously published voltage vs. laser pulse

using the published voltage vs. base-temperature sweep of CdTe permits
extraction of a specific heat ($11.27 \pm 2.54~\mathrm{J~K^{-1}mol^{-1}}$ at
$23.1~\mathrm{K}$) in good agreement with the literature

gets extended by a factor of more than 30 times as compared to what is
suggested by the classical picture by William F. Wells, for 50% relative

lifetimes of the small droplets further increases and goes up to around 150
times for 90% relative humidity, implying more than two meters advection range
of the respiratory droplets within one second. Employing Lagrangian statistics,
we demonstrate that the turbulent humid respiratory puff engulfs the small

implying that they can be transported much further during the respiratory

fourth-generation synchrotron light sources has necessitated improvisations in
the experimental configuration and the subsequent data analysis. One such
possibly unavoidable improvisation that is envisioned in this paper is a
photon-counting area detector whose face is tilted away from the perpendicular
to the Bragg-diffracted beam during acquisition of the coherent diffraction
signal. We describe a likely circumstance in which one would require such a
detector configuration, along with experimental precedent at third generation
synchrotrons. Using physically accurate diffraction simulations from synthetic
scatterers in the presence of such tilted detectors, we analyze the general
nature of the observed signal distortion qualitatively and quantitatively, and
provide a prescription to correct for it during image reconstruction. Our
simulations and reconstructions are based on an adaptation of the known theory
of BCDI sampling geometry as well as recently developed projection-based
methods of wavefield propagation. Such configurational modifications and their
numerical remedies are potentially valuable in realizing unconventional
coherent diffraction measurement geometries and eventually paving the way for
the integration of BCDI into new materials characterization experiments at

a recent landmark study reveals that several deep reconstruction networks are
unstable for computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Specifically, three kinds of instabilities were reported: (1) strong image
artefacts from tiny perturbations, (2) small features missing in a deeply
reconstructed image, and (3) decreased imaging performance with increased input
data. On the other hand, compressed sensing (CS) inspired reconstruction
methods do not suffer from these instabilities because of their built-in kernel
awareness. For deep reconstruction to realize its full potential and become a
mainstream approach for tomographic imaging, it is thus critically important to
meet this challenge by stabilizing deep reconstruction networks. Here we
propose an Analytic Compressed Iterative Deep (ACID) framework to address this
challenge. ACID synergizes a deep reconstruction network trained on big data,
kernel awareness from CS-inspired processing, and iterative refinement to
minimize the data residual relative to real measurement. Our study demonstrates
that the deep reconstruction using ACID is accurate and stable, and sheds light
on the converging mechanism of the ACID iteration under a Bounded Relative
Error Norm (BREN) condition. In particular, the study shows that ACID-based
reconstruction is resilient against adversarial attacks, superior to classic
sparsity-regularized reconstruction alone, and eliminates the three kinds of
instabilities. We anticipate that this integrative data-driven approach will
help promote development and translation of deep tomographic image
reconstruction networks into clinical applications.

Malware classification is the task of determining to which family a new
malicious variant belongs. Variants of the same malware family show similar
behavioral patterns. Thus, classifying newly discovered malicious programs and
applications helps assess the risks they pose. Moreover, malware classification
facilitates determining which of the newly discovered variants should undergo
manual analysis by a security expert, in order to determine whether they belong
to a new family (e.g., one whose members exploit a zero-day vulnerability) or
are simply the result of a concept drift within a known malicious family. This

tools for malware classification. In this work, we present DAEMON - a novel
dataset-agnostic malware classifier. A key property of DAEMON is that the type
of features it uses and the manner in which they are mined facilitate
understanding the distinctive behavior of malware families, making its
classification decisions explainable. We've optimized DAEMON using a
large-scale dataset of x86 binaries, belonging to a mix of several malware

it, without any algorithmic change, feature re-engineering or parameter tuning,

of numerous malware families. DAEMON obtained highly accurate classification

interaction between overshooting convection and the large-scale poloidal fields
residing in radiative zones. We have run a suite of 3D Boussinesq numerical
calculations in a spherical shell that consists of a convection zone with an
underlying stable region that initially compactly contains a dipole field. By
varying the strength of the convective driving, we find that, in the less
turbulent regime, convection acts as turbulent diffusion that removes the field
faster than solely molecular diffusion would do. However, in the more turbulent
regime, turbulent pumping becomes more efficient and partially counteracts
turbulent diffusion, leading to a local accumulation of the field below the
overshoot region. These simulations suggest that dipole fields might be
confined in underlying stable regions by highly turbulent convective motions at
stellar parameters. The confinement is of large-scale field in an average sense
and we show that it is reasonably modeled by mean-field ideas. Our findings are
particularly interesting for certain models of the Sun, which require a
large-scale, poloidal magnetic field to be confined in the solar radiative zone
in order to explain simultaneously the uniform rotation of the latter and the
thinness of the solar tachocline.

many-body description differs qualitatively depending on whether the system is
of closed-(sub)shell or open-(sub)shell nature. Here, we extend the discussion
to the more general framework of Finite-Temperature HFB (FTHFB) which deals
with statistical density operators, instead of pure many-body states. We
scrutinize in detail the zero-temperature and zero-pairing limits of such a

systems, we find that the FTHFB formulism reduces to the (zero-temperature)
Hartree-Fock formulism, i.e. we recover the textbook solution. For open-shell
systems, however, the resulting description depends on the order in which both
limits are taken: if the zero-temperature limit is performed first, the FTHFB
density operator demotes to a pure state which is a linear combination of a
finite number of Slater determinants, i.e. the case of arXiv:2006.02871. If the
zero-pairing limit is performed first, the FTHFB density operator remains a
mixture of a finite number of Slater determinants with non-zero entropy, even

segmentation and show that self-consistency can be a powerful source of
self-supervision to greatly improve the performance of a data-driven model with
access to only a small amount of labeled data. Self-consistency uses the simple
observation that the results of semantic segmentation for a specific image
should not change under transformations like horizontal flipping (i.e., the
results should only be flipped). In other words, the output of a model should
be consistent under equivariant transformations. The self-supervisory signal of
self-consistency is particularly helpful during active learning since the model
is prone to overfitting when there is only a small amount of labeled training
data. In our proposed active learning framework, we iteratively extract small
image patches that need to be labeled, by selecting image patches that have
high uncertainty (high entropy) under equivariant transformations. We enforce
pixel-wise self-consistency between the outputs of segmentation network for
each image and its transformation (horizontally flipped) to utilize the rich
self-supervisory information and reduce the uncertainty of the network. In this
way, we are able to find the image patches over which the current model
struggles the most to classify. By iteratively training over these difficult
image patches, our experiments show that our active learning approach reaches
$\sim96\%$ of the top performance of a model trained on all data, by using only
$12\%$ of the total data on benchmark semantic segmentation datasets (e.g.,
CamVid and Cityscapes).

case of a conjecture of Baste, F\""urst, Henning, Mohr and Rautenbach (2019) on
regular graphs. More generally, we prove that every graph with $n$ vertices and
$m$ edges and maximum degree at most $3$ has a maximal matching of size at most
$\frac{4n-m}{6}+ \frac{1}{2}$. These bounds are attained by the graph
$K_{3,3}$, but asymptotically there may still be some room for improvement.
Moreover, the claimed maximal matchings can be found efficiently. As a
corollary, we have a $\left(\frac{25}{18} + O \left( \frac{1}{n}\right)\right)
$-approximation algorithm for minimum maximal matching in connected cubic
graphs.

opportunities. After a cancer diagnosis, staging provides essential information
about the extent of disease in the body and the expected response to a
particular treatment. The leading importance of classifying cancer patients at
the early stage into high or low-risk groups has led many research teams, both
from the biomedical and bioinformatics field, to study the application of Deep
Learning (DL) methods. The ability of DL to detect critical features from
complex datasets is a significant achievement in early diagnosis and cell
cancer progression. In this paper, we focus the attention on osteosarcoma.
Osteosarcoma is one of the primary malignant bone tumors which usually afflicts
people in adolescence. Our contribution to the classification of osteosarcoma
cells is made as follows: a DL approach is applied to discriminate human
Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) from osteosarcoma cells and to classify the
different cell populations under investigation. Glass slides of differ-ent cell
populations were cultured including MSCs, differentiated in healthy bone cells
(osteoblasts) and osteosarcoma cells, both single cell populations or mixed.
Images of such samples of isolated cells (single-type of mixed) are recorded
with traditional optical microscopy. DL is then applied to identify and
classify single cells. Proper data augmentation techniques and cross-fold
validation are used to appreciate the capabilities of a convolutional neural
network to address the cell detection and classification problem. Based on the
results obtained on individual cells, and to the versatility and scalability of
our DL approach, the next step will be its application to discriminate and
classify healthy or cancer tissues to advance digital pathology.

acoustic wave equations can be used to describe the anisotropic nature of the
earth. To solve a frequency-domain wave equation, we often need to invert the
impedance matrix. This results in a dramatic increase in computational cost as
the model size increases. It is even a bigger challenge for anisotropic media,
where the impedance matrix is far more complex. To address this issue, we use
the emerging paradigm of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to obtain
wavefield solutions for an acoustic wave equation for transversely isotropic
(TI) media with a vertical axis of symmetry (VTI). PINNs utilize the concept of
automatic differentiation to calculate its partial derivatives. Thus, we use
the wave equation as a loss function to train a neural network to provide
functional solutions to form of the acoustic VTI wave equation. Instead of
predicting the pressure wavefields directly, we solve for the scattered
pressure wavefields to avoid dealing with the point source singularity. We use
the spatial coordinates as input data to the network, which outputs the real
and imaginary parts of the scattered wavefields and auxiliary function. After
training a deep neural network (NN), we can evaluate the wavefield at any point
in space instantly using this trained NN. We demonstrate these features on a
simple anomaly model and a layered model. Additional tests on a modified 3D
Overthrust model and a model with irregular topography also show the
effectiveness of the proposed method.

the $\alpha+\alpha$ and spin-aligned $t+t$ systems are attractive at
intermediate distances. The Pauli blocking between identical-nucleon pairs is
responsible for the cluster-cluster repulsion and becomes dominant in the
shallow binding limit. We demonstrate that two $d$-clusters could be bound if
the $NN$ force has nonzero range and is strong enough to form a deeply bound
$d$-cluster, or if the $NN$ force has both even-parity and odd-parity

relatively unexplored volume outside the local Universe, where galaxies will be
largely spatially unresolved and probe a range of X-ray luminosities that
overlap with the low luminosity and/or highly obscured AGN population. We use

that the eROSITA 4-year survey, will detect $\gtrsim$ 15 000 galaxies (3

alternative, we develop an incremental RL technique that simultaneously reduces
building energy consumption without sacrificing overall comfort. We compare the
performance of our incremental RL controller to that of a static RL controller

predictor that generalizes on all environments. Popular approaches in this
field use the hypothesis that such a predictor shall be an \textit{invariant
predictor} that captures the mechanism that remains constant across
environments. While these approaches have been experimentally successful in
various case studies, there is still much room for the theoretical validation
of this hypothesis. This paper presents a new set of theoretical conditions
necessary for an invariant predictor to achieve the OOD optimality. Our theory
not only applies to non-linear cases, but also generalizes the necessary
condition used in \citet{rojas2018invariant}. We also derive Inter Gradient
Alignment algorithm from our theory and demonstrate its competitiveness on
MNIST-derived benchmark datasets as well as on two of the three

In experimental

However, few studies have been conducted to determine why framing or priming
specific words can alter people's behaviour. Here, we show that the behaviour
of participants in a game-theoretical experiment is driven mainly by social
norms, and that participants' adherence to different social norms is influenced
by the exposure to economic terminology. To explore how these
terminology-driven changes impact behavior at the system level, we use
established frameworks for modeling collective cooperative behaviour. We find
that economic terminology induces a behavioural difference which is larger than
that caused by financial incentives in the magnitude usually employed in
experiments and simulation. These findings place an increased responsibility on
scientists and science communicators, as scientific terminology is increasingly

  chemotaxis models with singular sensitivity in any dimensional setting",,,,,"math.AP math.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, it has been drawn a lot of attention to the question of
whether logistic kinetics is sufficient to enforce the global existence of
classical solutions or to prevent finite-time blow-up in various chemotaxis
models. However, for several important chemotaxis models, only in the space two
dimensional setting, it has been shown that logistic kinetics is sufficient to
enforce the global existence of classical solutions (see [15] and [34]). The
current paper is to give a confirmed answer to the above question for the
following parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with singular sensitivity and
logistic source in any space dimensional setting, \begin{equation}
\begin{cases} u_t=\Delta u-\chi\nabla\cdot (\frac{u}{v} \nabla
v)+u(a(x,t)-b(x,t) u),\quad x\in \Omega\cr 0=\Delta v-\mu v+\nu u,\quad x\in
\Omega \quad \cr \frac{\partial u}{\partial n}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial
n}=0,\quad x\in\partial\Omega, \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\Omega \subset
\mathbb{R}^n$ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$, $\chi$
is the singular chemotaxis sensitivity coefficient, $a(x,t)$ and $b(x,t)$ are
positive smooth functions, and $\mu,\nu$ are positive constants. We prove that,
for any given nonnegative initial data $0\not\equiv u_0\in C^0(\bar \Omega)$,
(0.1) has a unique globally defined classical solution
$(u(t,x;u_0),v(t,x;u_0))$ with $u(0,x;u_0)=u_0(x)$, which shows that, in any
space dimensional setting, logistic kinetics is sufficient to enforce the
global existence of classical solutions and hence prevents the occurrence of
finite-time blow-up even for arbitrarily large $\chi$. In addition, the
solutions are shown to be uniformly bounded under the conditions
$a_{\inf}>\frac{\mu \chi^2}{4}$ when $\chi \leq 2$ and $a_{\inf}>\mu (\chi-1)$
when $\chi>2$.

M_\odot$), where lBHs and hBHs are below and above the pair-instability mass
gap ($50-130 M_\odot$), respectively. Pop. III BH-BHs can be categorized into
three subpopulations: BH-BHs without hBHs (hBH0s: $m_{\rm tot} \lesssim 100
M_\odot$), with one hBH (hBH1s: $m_{\rm tot} \sim 130-260 M_\odot$), and with
two hBHs (hBH2s: $m_{\rm tot} \sim 270-400 M_\odot$), where $m_{\rm tot}$ is
the total mass of a BH-BH. Their merger rate densities at the current universe
are $\sim 0.1$ yr$^{-1}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ for hBH0s, and $\sim 0.01$ yr$^{-1}$
Gpc$^{-3}$ for the sum of hBH1s and hBH2s, provided that the mass density of
Pop. III stars is $\sim 10^{13} M_\odot$ Gpc$^{-3}$. These rates are modestly
insensitive to initial conditions and single star models. The hBH1 and hBH2
mergers can dominate BH-BHs with hBHs discovered in near future. They have low
effective spins $\lesssim 0.2$ in the current universe. The number ratio of the
hBH2s to the hBH1s is high, $\gtrsim 0.1$. We also find BHs in the mass gap (up
to $\sim 85 M_\odot$) merge. These merger rates can be reduced to nearly zero
if Pop. III binaries are always wide ($\gtrsim 100 R_\odot$), and if Pop. III
stars always enter into chemically homogeneous evolution. The presence of close
Pop. III binaries ($\sim 10 R_\odot$) are crucial for avoiding the worst
scenario.

shear strain at constant packing fraction and at constant pressure,
""polydispersity"" strain (in which we change the particle size distribution) at
constant packing fraction and at constant pressure, and isotropic compression.
For each deformation, we show that there are two classes of changes in the
interparticle contact networks: jump changes and point changes. Jump changes
occur when a contact network becomes mechanically unstable, particles
""rearrange"", and the potential energy (when the strain is applied at constant
packing fraction) or enthalpy (when the strain is applied at constant pressure)
and all derivatives are discontinuous. During point changes, a single contact
is either added to or removed from the contact network. For repulsive linear
spring interactions, second- and higher-order derivatives of the potential
energy/enthalpy are discontinuous at a point change, while for Hertzian
interactions, third- and higher-order derivatives of the potential
energy/enthalpy are discontinuous. We illustrate the importance of point
changes by studying the transition from a hexagonal crystal to a disordered
crystal induced by applying polydispersity strain. During this transition, the
system only undergoes point changes, with no jump changes. We emphasize that
one must understand point changes, as well as jump changes, to predict the

has gained an increasing interest. The patterns that deep networks have learned
from a training dataset can be grasped by observing the feature variation among

to increase the classification probability for the target class irrespective of
the internal characteristics of deep networks. This often leads to unclear
explanations that deviate from real-world data distributions. To address this

statistics learned from a training dataset. Especially, we gradually construct
an explanation by iterating over masking and composition steps. The masking
step aims to select an important feature from the input data to be classified
as a target class. Meanwhile, the composition step aims to optimize the
previously selected feature by ensuring that its output score is close to the
logit space of the training data that are classified as the target class.

interpretations on various classification datasets and verify that such

during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to check for a pulse. However,
pausing CPR during a pulseless rhythm can worsen patient outcome. Our objective
is to design an ECG-based algorithm that predicts pulse status during
uninterrupted CPR and evaluate its performance. Methods: We evaluated 383
patients being treated for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest using defibrillator
data. We collected paired and immediately adjacent ECG segments having an
organized rhythm. Segments were collected during the 10s period of ongoing CPR
prior to a pulse check, and 5s segments without CPR during the pulse check. ECG
segments with or without a pulse were identified by the audio annotation of a
paramedic's pulse check findings and recorded blood pressures. We developed an
algorithm to predict the clinical pulse status based on the wavelet transform
of the bandpass-filtered ECG, applying principle component analysis. We then
trained a linear discriminant model using 3 principle component modes. Model
performance was evaluated on test group segments with and without CPR using
receiver operating curves and according to the initial arrest rhythm. Results:
There were 230 patients (540 pulse checks) in the training set and 153 patients
(372 pulse checks) in the test set. Overall 38% (351/912) of checks had a
spontaneous pulse. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUCs) for predicting pulse status with and without CPR on test data were 0.84
and 0.89, respectively. Conclusion: A novel ECG-based algorithm demonstrates
potential to improve resuscitation by predicting presence of a spontaneous
pulse without pausing CPR. Significance: Our algorithm predicts pulse status
during uninterrupted CPR, allowing for CPR to proceed unimpeded by pauses to
check for a pulse and potentially improving resuscitation performance.

Numerical simulations show that the radial coupling strength $k$ between the

In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end GAN architecture that can generate

hierarchical structure that simultaneously generates a low-resolution version
of the image and a randomly selected sub-volume of the high-resolution image.
The hierarchical design has two advantages: First, the memory demand for
training on high-resolution images is amortized among sub-volumes. Furthermore,
anchoring the high-resolution sub-volumes to a single low-resolution image
ensures anatomical consistency between sub-volumes. During inference, our model
can directly generate full high-resolution images. We also incorporate an
encoder with a similar hierarchical structure into the model to extract
features from the images. Experiments on 3D thorax CT and brain MRI demonstrate
that our approach outperforms state of the art in image generation. We also
demonstrate clinical applications of the proposed model in data augmentation

to original images can fool deep learning models. However, the current
adversarial perturbations are usually shown in the form of noises, and thus
have no practical meaning. Image watermark is a technique widely used for
copyright protection. We can regard image watermark as a king of meaningful
noises and adding it to the original image will not affect people's
understanding of the image content, and will not arouse people's suspicion.
Therefore, it will be interesting to generate adversarial examples using
watermarks. In this paper, we propose a novel watermark perturbation for
adversarial examples (Adv-watermark) which combines image watermarking
techniques and adversarial example algorithms. Adding a meaningful watermark to
the clean images can attack the DNN models. Specifically, we propose a novel
optimization algorithm, which is called Basin Hopping Evolution (BHE), to
generate adversarial watermarks in the black-box attack mode. Thanks to the
BHE, Adv-watermark only requires a few queries from the threat models to finish
the attacks. A series of experiments conducted on ImageNet and CASIA-WebFace
datasets show that the proposed method can efficiently generate adversarial
examples, and outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods. Moreover,
Adv-watermark is more robust against image transformation defense methods.

Here we present numerical simulations of frictionless, purely repulsive spheres

vertical load. We show that for sufficiently small strain amplitudes, cyclic
shear gives rise to homogeneous crystallization at a volume fraction $\phi =
0.646 \pm 0.001$. This result indicates that neither friction nor gravity is
essential for homogeneous crystallization in driven granular media.

mass and friction distributions of unknown objects, and performing robust
sliding actions by using the learned models. The proposed method is executed in
two consecutive phases. In the exploration phase, a table-top object is poked
by a robot from different angles. The observed motions of the object are
compared against simulated motions with various hypothesized mass and friction
models. The simulation-to-reality gap is then differentiated with respect to
the unknown mass and friction parameters, and the analytically computed
gradient is used to optimize those parameters. Since it is difficult to
disentangle the mass from the friction coefficients in low-data and
quasi-static motion regimes, our approach retains a set of locally optimal
pairs of mass and friction models. A probability distribution on the models is
computed based on the relative accuracy of each pair of models. In the
exploitation phase, a probabilistic planner is used to select a goal
configuration and waypoints that are stable with a high confidence. The
proposed technique is evaluated on real objects and using a real manipulator.
The results show that this technique can not only identify accurately mass and
friction coefficients of non-uniform heterogeneous objects, but can also be
used to successfully slide an unknown object to the edge of a table and pick it
up from there, without any human assistance or feedback.

objective is to find an infinite trajectory that satisfies an optimal selection
from a set of soft specifications expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL)
while nevertheless satisfying a hard specification expressed in LTL. Our
previous work considered a similar problem in which linear dynamic logic for
finite traces (LDLf), rather than LTL, was used to express the soft
constraints. In that work, LDLf was used to impose constraints on finite
prefixes of the infinite trajectory. By using LTL, one is able not only to
impose constraints on the finite prefixes of the trajectory, but also to set
`soft' goals across the entirety of the infinite trajectory. Our algorithm
first constructs a product automaton, on which the planning problem is reduced
to computing a lasso with minimum cost. Among all such lassos, it is desirable
to compute a shortest one. Though we prove that computing such a shortest lasso
is computationally hard, we also introduce an efficient greedy approach to
synthesize short lassos nonetheless. We present two case studies describing an
implementation of this approach, and report results of our experiment comparing

present a modification of the original protocol for walker population control
of Booth et al. JCP 131, 054106 (2009) in order to achieve equilibration at a
pre-defined average walker number and to avoid walker number overshoots. The
dynamics of the walker population is described by a noisy damped harmonic
oscillator and controlled by two parameters responsible for damping and
forcing, respectively, for which reasonable values are suggested. We further
introduce a population growth witness that can be used to detect annihilation
plateaus related to overcoming the FCIQMC sign problem. Features of the new
population control procedure such as precise walker number control and fast
equilibration are demonstrated. The standard error of the shift estimator for
the ground state energy as well as the population control bias are found to be
unaffected by the population control procedure or its parameters. The improved
control of the walker number, and thereby memory consumption, is a desirable
feature required for automating FCIQMC calculations and requires minimal

Learning an SR model with conventional pixel-wise loss usually is easily

environments is attracting much attention due to the time-evolving nature of
many real-world networks. The main and common objective of Dynamic Network
Embedding (DNE) is to efficiently update node embeddings while preserving
network topology at each time step. The idea of most existing DNE methods is to
capture the topological changes at or around the most affected nodes (instead
of all nodes) and accordingly update node embeddings. Unfortunately, this kind
of approximation, although can improve efficiency, cannot effectively preserve
the global topology of a dynamic network at each time step, due to not
considering the inactive sub-networks that receive accumulated topological
changes propagated via the high-order proximity. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a novel node selecting strategy to diversely select the representative
nodes over a network, which is coordinated with a new incremental learning
paradigm of Skip-Gram based embedding approach. The extensive experiments show

computation with $n$ threads in a tournament fashion. By such a standard
parallelizing method, we can solve the MCM problem in $O(n^2 \log n)$ steps
with $n$ threads. In our approach, we solve the MCM problem on GPU in a
pipeline fashion, i.e., we use GPU cores for supporting pipeline-stages so that
many elements of the solution table are partially computed in parallel at one
time. Our implementation determines one output value per one computational step
with $n$ threads in a pipeline fashion and constructs the solution table
totally in $O(n^2)$ steps with $n$ threads.

to train the model under the supervision of feature maps from the ground truth.
Four key technical contributions are made in the paper. First, pairs of hazy

obtain high-quality feature maps. Second, the basic GAN formulation is modified
by introducing perception loss, style loss, and feature regularization loss to
generate better results. Third, multi-scale images are applied as the input to
enhance the performance of discriminator. Finally, a hazy remote sensing

the ties between joint actions. The problem was circumvented by revising the

efficiently accommodate spatio-temporal dependencies on a large scale. Finally,
training a RL model to jointly control traffic lights in a large transportation

the first and second regimes are both governed, in terms of vibration

iterative methods to solve such problems; however, they cannot achieve
satisfactory results in both quality and computational speed. Other studies
formulate scheduling problems as a graph coloring problem (GCP) or its
extensions, but these formulations are limited to certain types of scheduling
problems. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to formulate a general
type of the PPS problem with resource allocation and process planning
integrated towards a typical objective, minimizing the makespan. The PPS
problem is formulated into an undirected weighted conflicting graph, where
nodes represent operations and their resources; edges represent constraints,
and weight factors are guidelines for the node selection at each time slot.
Then, the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem can be solved to find
the best set of operations with their desired resources for each discrete time
slot. This proposed approach solves the PPS problem directly with minimum
iterations. We establish that the proposed approach always returns a feasible
optimum or near-optimum solution to the PPS problem. The different weight
configurations of the proposed approach for solving the PPS problem are tested
on a real-world PPS example and further designated test instances to evaluate
the scalability, accuracy, and robustness.

  of the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem",,,,,"cs.DS math.CO math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, which considers a graph
with weights assigned to nodes and seeks to discover the ""heaviest"" independent
set, that is, a set of nodes with maximum total weight so that no two nodes in
the set are connected by an edge. The MWIS problem arises in many application
domains, including the resource-constrained scheduling, error-correcting
coding, complex system analysis and optimization, and communication networks.
Since solving the MWIS problem is the core function for finding the optimum
solution of our novel graph-based formulation of the resource-constrained
Process Planning and Scheduling (PPS) problem, it is essential to have
""good-performance"" algorithms to solve the MWIS problem. In this paper, we
propose a Novel Hybrid Heuristic Algorithm (NHHA) framework in a
divide-and-conquer structure that yields optimum feasible solutions to the MWIS
problem. The NHHA framework is optimized to minimize the recurrence. Using the
NHHA framework, we also solve the All Maximal Independent Sets Listing (AMISL)
problem, which can be seen as the subproblem of the MWIS problem. Moreover,
building composed MWIS algorithms that utilizing fast approximation algorithms
with the NHHA framework is an effective way to improve the accuracy of
approximation MWIS algorithms (e.g., GWMIN and GWMIN2 (Sakai et al., 2003)).
Eight algorithms for the MWIS problem, the exact MWIS algorithm, the AMISL
algorithm, two approximation algorithms from the literature, and four composed
algorithms, are applied and tested for solving the graph-based formulation of
the resource-constrained PPS problem to evaluate the scalability, accuracy, and
robustness.

lines and surface normals using spherical mean-shift clustering, leveraging the
weak Manhattan World assumption. Then translation is computed from point and

optimization strategy. The proposed method outperforms the state of the art on
common SLAM benchmarks such as ICL-NUIM and TUM RGB-D.

of minority class accurately. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown
some potentials to tackle class imbalance problems due to their capability of
reproducing data distributions given ample training data samples. However, the
scarce samples of one or more classes still pose a great challenge for GANs to
learn accurate distributions for the minority classes. In this work, we propose
an Annealing Genetic GAN (AGGAN) method, which aims to reproduce the
distributions closest to the ones of the minority classes using only limited
data samples. Our AGGAN renovates the training of GANs as an evolutionary
process that incorporates the mechanism of simulated annealing. In particular,
the generator uses different training strategies to generate multiple offspring
and retain the best. Then, we use the Metropolis criterion in the simulated
annealing to decide whether we should update the best offspring for the
generator. As the Metropolis criterion allows a certain chance to accept the
worse solutions, it enables our AGGAN steering away from the local optimum.
According to both theoretical analysis and experimental studies on multiple
imbalanced image datasets, we prove that the proposed training strategy can
enable our AGGAN to reproduce the distributions of minority classes from scarce
samples and provide an effective and robust solution for the class imbalance

devise a Trie-based translation model to make a data increment. In this phase,
a Bag-of-Core-Words trick is conducted, which increased the data increment's

component (NLVC). We found that the $\rm H_2$ line is detected in 17 sources
($\sim 50 \%$ detection rate), and [OI] is detected in all sources but one. The
NLV components of the $\rm H_2$ and [OI] emission are kinematically linked,
with a strong correlation between the peak velocities and the full widths at
half maximum of the two lines. Assuming Keplerian broadening, we found that the
[OI] NVLC originates from a disk region between 0.05 and 20 au and that of $\rm
H_2$ in a region from 2 and 20 au. We did not find any clear correlation
between v$\rm_p$ of the $\rm H_2$ and [OI] NVLC and the outer disk inclination.
This result is in line with previous studies. Our results suggest that
molecular and neutral atomic emission in disk winds originate from regions that
might overlap, and that the survival of molecular winds in disks strongly
depends on the gas exposure to the radiation from the central star. Our results
demonstrate the potential of wide-band high-resolution spectroscopy in linking
tracers of different manifestations of the same phenomenon.

the gate voltage dependence of the quartet critical current oscillations

Landau-Zener tunneling and many levels in the quantum dot. Our theory provides
a simple ``Floquet level and population'' mechanism for inversion tuned by the

proposed for symmetric tridiagonal matrices based on ScaLAPACK and a parallel
structured matrix multiplication algorithm, called PSMMA. Computing the
eigenvectors via matrix-matrix multiplications is the most computationally
expensive part of the divide-and-conquer algorithm, and one of the matrices
involved in such multiplications is a rank-structured Cauchy-like matrix. By
exploiting this particular property, PSMMA constructs the local matrices by
using generators of Cauchy-like matrices without any communication, and further
reduces the computation costs by using a structured low-rank approximation
algorithm. Thus, both the communication and computation costs are reduced.
Experimental results show that both PSMMA and PSDC are highly scalable and
scale to 4096 processes at least. PSDC has better scalability than PHDC that
was proposed in [J. Comput. Appl. Math. 344 (2018) 512--520] and only scaled to
300 processes for the same matrices. Comparing with \texttt{PDSTEDC} in
ScaLAPACK, PSDC is always faster and achieves $1.4$x--$1.6$x speedup for some
matrices with few deflations. PSDC is also comparable with ELPA, with PSDC
being faster than ELPA when using few processes and a little slower when using
many processes.

stress of polymeric flows with memory. We make no assumptions regarding the
functional form of the constitutive relations, except that they should be
expressible in differential form as a function of the local stress- and
strain-rate tensors. In particular, we use a Gaussian Process regression to
infer the constitutive relations from stress trajectories generated from
small-scale (fixed strain-rate) microscopic polymer simulations. For
simplicity, a Hookean dumbbell representation is used as a microscopic model,
but the method itself can be generalized to incorporate more realistic
descriptions. The learned constitutive relation is then used to perform
macroscopic flow simulations, allowing us to update the stress distribution in
the fluid in a manner that accounts for the microscopic polymer dynamics. The
results using the learned constitutive relation are in excellent agreement with
full Multi-Scale Simulations, which directly couple micro/macro degrees of
freedom, as well as the exact analytical solution given by the Maxwell
constitutive relation. We are able to fully capture the history dependence of
the flow, as well as the elastic effects in the fluid. We expect the proposed
learning/simulation approach to be used not only to study the dynamics of
entangled polymer flows, but also for the complex dynamics of other Soft Matter
systems, which possess a similar hierarchy of length- and time-scales.

is characterized by lesions in the central nervous system. Typically, magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) is used for tracking disease progression. Automatic
image processing methods can be used to segment lesions and derive quantitative
lesion parameters. So far, methods have focused on lesion segmentation for
individual MRI scans. However, for monitoring disease progression,
\textit{lesion activity} in terms of new and enlarging lesions between two time
points is a crucial biomarker. For this problem, several classic methods have
been proposed, e.g., using difference volumes. Despite their success for
single-volume lesion segmentation, deep learning approaches are still rare for
lesion activity segmentation. In this work, convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) are studied for lesion activity segmentation from two time points. For
this task, CNNs are designed and evaluated that combine the information from
two points in different ways. In particular, two-path architectures with
attention-guided interactions are proposed that enable effective information
exchange between the two time point's processing paths. It is demonstrated that
deep learning-based methods outperform classic approaches and it is shown that
attention-guided interactions significantly improve performance. Furthermore,
the attention modules produce plausible attention maps that have a masking
effect that suppresses old, irrelevant lesions. A lesion-wise false positive
rate of 26.4% is achieved at a true positive rate of 74.2%, which is not
significantly different from the interrater performance.

which limits the scalability and the performance of wireless networks. Such a
problem is especially crucial in mobile ad hoc networks, dense networks,
networks of vehicles and drones, sensor networks. In other words, this problem
occurs in any scenario with frequent changes in topology or interference level
on one side and with strong requirements on delay, reliability, power
consumption, or capacity on the other side. If the control information changes
partially, it may be worth sending only differential updates instead of
messages containing full information to reduce overhead. However, such an
approach needs accurate tuning of dissemination parameters, since it is
necessary to guarantee information relevance in error-prone wireless networks.
In the paper, we provide a deep study of two approaches for generating
differential updates - namely, incremental and cumulative - and compare their
efficiency. We show that the incremental approach allows significantly reducing
the amount of generated control information compared to the cumulative one,
while providing the same level of information relevance. We develop an
analytical model for the incremental approach and propose an algorithm which
allows tuning its parameters, depending on the number of nodes in the network,
their mobility, and wireless channel quality. Using the developed analytical
model, we show that the incremental approach is very useful for static dense
network deployments and networks with low and medium mobility, since it allows
us to significantly reduce the amount of control information compared to the

correlation function of the stellar orbital plane orientations as a function of
their initial angular separation and diversity in orbital parameters
(semi-major axis, eccentricity). As expected, the larger the spread in initial
orientations and orbital parameters, the more efficient the dilution of a given
set of co-eval stars, with a characteristic timescale set up by the coherence
time of the background potential fluctuations. A Markovian prescription which
matches numerical simulations allows us to efficiently probe the underlying
kinematic properties of the unresolved nucleus when requesting consistency with
a given dilution efficiency, imposed by the observed stellar disc within the
one arcsecond of Sgr A*. As a proof of concept, we compute maps of constant
dilution times as a function of the semi major axis cusp index and fraction of
intermediate mass black holes in the old background stellar cluster. This
computation suggests that vector resonant relaxation should prove useful in

The previous study based on H\alpha line observations of the solar flares
during March 05, 2014 by Xu et al. (2017) revealed uniform and continuous
rotation of the magnetic fan-spine. Preliminary analysis of the flare time
profiles revealed quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) with similar properties in
hard X-rays, H\alpha, and microwaves. In this work, we address which process
the observed periodicities are related to: periodic acceleration of electrons
or plasma heating? QPPs are analysed in the H\alpha emission from the centre of
the fan (inner ribbon R1), a circular ribbon (R2), a remote source (R3), and an
elongated ribbon (R4) located between R2 and R3. The methods of correlation,
Fourier, wavelet, and empirical mode decomposition are used. QPPs in H\alpha
emission are compared with those in microwave and X-ray emission. We found
multi-wavelength QPPs with periods around 150 s, 125 s, and 190 s. The 150-s
period is seen to co-exist in H\alpha, hard X-rays, and microwave emissions,
that allowed us to connect it with flare kernels R1 and R2. These kernels
spatially coincide with the site of the primary flare energy release. The 125-s
period is found in the H\alpha emission of the elongated ribbon R4 and the
microwave emission at 5.7 GHz during the decay phase. The 190-s period is
present in the emission during all flare phases in the H\alpha emission of both
the remote source R3 and the elongated ribbon R4, in soft X-rays, and
microwaves at 4--8 GHz. We connected the dominant 150-s QPPs with the slipping
reconnection mechanism occurring in the fan. We suggested that the period of
125 s in the elongated ribbon can be caused by a kink oscillation of the outer
spine connecting the primary reconnection site with the remote footpoint. The
period of 190 s is associated with the 3-min sunspot oscillations.

grasping force. We utilize the port-Hamiltonian structure of standard

port-Hamiltonian system into one with a constant mass-inertia matrix. We then
achieve impedance grasping control via a \emph{virtual spring} with a variable

dissipation term in the impedance grasping controller, which is needed to
obtain a smoother non-contact to contact transition. Simulations and

the number of hard collisions, provides information on the energy loss of
partons traversing the QGP. The measurement allows to test with high precision
the predictions of theoretical model calculations. In addition, the decay of
the $\pi^{0}$ and $\eta$ mesons are the dominant backgrounds for all direct

meson production is key to learning about the temperature and space-time
evolution of the QGP. In the ALICE experiment neutral mesons can be detected
via their decay into two photons. The latter can be reconstructed using the two

excellent momentum resolution of the conversion photons down to very low

traversing the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) which is formed in heavy-ion collisions
at the LHC. In proton--proton (pp) collisions, neutral mesons allow us to test
with high precision the predictions of perturbative QCD and other model
calculations, and also serve as a reference for pA and AA collisions. In pA
collisions, cold nuclear matter effects are studied. In the ALICE experiment,
which is dedicated to the study of the QGP, neutral mesons can be detected via
their decay to two photons. The latter can be reconstructed using the two
calorimeters EMCal and PHOS or via conversions in the detector material.
Combining state-of-the-art reconstruction techniques with the large data sample
delivered by the LHC in Run 2 gives us the opportunity to enhance the precision
of our measurements. In these proceedings, an overview of neutral meson
production in pp, p--Pb and Pb--Pb collisions at LHC energies, as measured with

mechanical oscillations because these modes have maximum response to stimuli.
However, a deeper understanding of mechanical motion could be obtained by also
looking at modal responses at frequencies in between resonances. A common way
to do this is to force a mechanical object into oscillations and study its
off-resonance behaviour. In this paper, we present visualisation of the modal
response shapes for a mechanical drum driven off resonance. By using the
frequency modal analysis, we describe these shapes as a superposition of
resonance modes. We find that the spatial distribution of the oscillating
component of the driving force affects the modal weight or participation.
Moreover, we are able to infer the asymmetry of the drum by studying the
dependence of the resonance modes shapes on the frequency of the driving force.
Our results highlight that dynamic responses of any mechanical system are
mixtures of their resonance modes with various modal weights, further giving
credence to the universality of this phenomenon.

benefits, Multi-task Learning (MTL) has long been researched in various domains

MTL benefits from the positive transfer of information from multiple tasks, in
a real environment, tasks inevitably have a conflict between them during the
learning phase, called negative transfer. The negative transfer hampers
function from achieving the optimality and degrades the performance. To solve
the problem of the task conflict, previous works only suggested partial
solutions that are not fundamental, but ad-hoc. A common approach is using a
weighted sum of losses. The weights are adjusted to induce positive transfer.
Paradoxically, this kind of solution acknowledges the problem of negative
transfer and cannot remove it unless the weight of the task is set to zero.
Therefore, these previous methods had limited success. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach that can drive positive transfer and suppress
negative transfer by leveraging class-wise weights in the learning process. The
weights act as an arbitrator of the fundamental unit of information to
determine its positive or negative status to the main task.

matter physics giving rise to many interesting phenomena, and fostering the
development of new quantum technologies. In this thesis we study the quantum
dynamics that take place in low dimensional topological systems, specifically
1D and 2D lattices that are instances of topological insulators. First, we
study the dynamics of doublons, bound states of two fermions that appear in
systems with strong Hubbard-like interactions. We also include the effect of
periodic drivings and investigate how the interplay between interaction and
driving produces novel phenomena. Prominent among these are the disappearance
of topological edge states in the SSH-Hubbard model, the sublattice confinement
of doublons in certain 2D lattices, and the long-range transfer of doublons
between the edges of any finite lattice. Then, we apply our insights about
topological insulators to a rather different setup: quantum emitters coupled to
the photonic analogue of the SSH model. In this setup we compute the dynamics
of the emitters, regarding the photonic SSH model as a collective structured
bath. We find that the topological nature of the bath reflects itself in the
photon bound states and the effective dipolar interactions between the
emitters. Also, the topology of the bath affects the single-photon scattering
properties. Finally, we peek into the possibility of using these kind of setups

spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry, remains one of the long-standing
questions in high-energy physics. The difficulty of this task stems from the
limitations of current analytical and numerical techniques to address
non-perturbative phenomena in non-Abelian gauge theories. In this work, we show
how similar phenomena emerge in simpler models, and how these can be further
investigated using state-of-the-art cold-atom quantum simulators. More
specifically, we introduce the rotor Jackiw-Rebbi model, a (1+1)-dimensional
quantum field theory where interactions between Dirac fermions are mediated by
quantum rotors. Starting from a mixture of ultracold atoms in an optical
lattice, we show how this quantum field theory emerges in the long-wavelength
limit. For a wide and experimentally-relevant parameter regime, the Dirac
fermions acquire a dynamical mass via the spontaneous breakdown of chiral
symmetry. Moreover, we study the effect of both quantum and thermal
fluctuations, which lead to the phenomenon of chiral symmetry restoration.
Finally, we uncover a confinement-deconfinement quantum phase transition, where
meson-like fermions fractionalise into quark-like quasi-particles bound to
topological solitons of the rotor field. The proliferation of these solitons at
finite chemical potentials again serves to restore the chiral symmetry,
yielding a clear analogy with the quark-gluon plasma in quantum chromodynamics,
where this symmetry coexists with the deconfined fractional charges. Our
results show how the interplay between these phenomena could be analyse in
realistic atomic experiments.

fitting a robust covariance matrix to the data. Its regularization ensures that
the covariance matrix is well-conditioned in any dimension. The MRCD assumes
that the non-outlying observations are roughly elliptically distributed, but
many datasets are not of that form. Moreover, the computation time of MRCD
increases substantially when the number of variables goes up, and nowadays
datasets with many variables are common. The proposed Kernel Minimum
Regularized Covariance Determinant (KMRCD) estimator addresses both issues. It
is not restricted to elliptical data because it implicitly computes the MRCD
estimates in a kernel induced feature space. A fast algorithm is constructed
that starts from kernel-based initial estimates and exploits the kernel trick
to speed up the subsequent computations. Based on the KMRCD estimates, a rule
is proposed to flag outliers. The KMRCD algorithm performs well in simulations,

correlation energy correction. The corrections can be readily extracted from
electron correlation calculations of clusters with almost no additional effort.
Benchmark calculations show that the improved CIM approach can recover more
than 99.97% of the conventional correlation energy. By combining the CIM
approach with the domain based local pair natural orbital (DLPNO) local
correlation approach, we have provided accurate binding energies at the
CIM-DLPNO-CCSD(T) level for a test set consisting of eight weakly bound
complexes ranging in size from 200 to 1027 atoms. With these results as the
reference data, the accuracy and applicability of other electron correlation
methods and a few density functional methods for large systems have been
assessed.

that the total weight of all edges between $S$ and $V \setminus S$ is
minimized. Karger's longstanding $O(m \log^3 n)$ time randomized algorithm for
this problem was very recently improved in two independent works to $O(m \log^2

efficient algorithms in the cut-query and in the streaming models of

Historically, Music Information Retrieval researchers have focused primarily on
score-informed source separation, but more recent approaches explore
lyrics-informed source separation. However, because of the lack of multitrack
datasets with time-aligned lyrics, models use weak conditioning with
non-aligned lyrics. In this paper, we present a multimodal multitrack dataset
with lyrics aligned in time at the word level with phonetic information as well
as explore strong conditioning using the aligned phonemes. Our model follows a
U-Net architecture and takes as input both the magnitude spectrogram of a
musical mixture and a matrix with aligned phonetic information. The phoneme
matrix is embedded to obtain the parameters that control Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) layers. These layers condition the U-Net feature maps to
adapt the separation process to the presence of different phonemes via affine
transformations. We show that phoneme conditioning can be successfully applied
to improve singing voice source separation.

the translational, as well as rotational mean square displacements, have a
distinctive three-step growth for fixed values of self-propulsion force, and
steadily increase with self-propulsion, irrespective of the nature of the
crowder. On the other hand, in the absence of crowders, the rotational dynamics
of the Janus probe is independent of self-propulsion force. On replacing the
repulsive polymers with sticky ones, translational and rotational mean square
displacements of the Janus probe show a sharp drop. Since different faces of a
Janus particle interact differently with the environment, we show that the
direction of self-propulsion also affects its dynamics. The ratio of long-time
translational and rotational diffusivities of the self-propelled probe with a
fixed self-propulsion, when plotted against the area fraction of the crowders,
passes through a minima and at higher area fraction merges to its value in the
absence of the crowder. This points towards the decoupling of translational and
rotational dynamics of the self-propelled probe at intermediate area fraction
of the crowders. However, such translational-rotational decoupling is absent

or electroencephalography data, high accuracy of the coregistration of sources
and sensors is mandatory. Usually, the source space is derived from magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI). In most cases, however, no quality assessment is
reported for sensor-to-MRI coregistrations. If any, typically root mean squares
(RMS) of point residuals are provided. It has been shown, however, that RMS of
residuals do not correlate with coregistration errors. We suggest using target
registration error (TRE) as criterion for the quality of sensor-to-MRI
coregistrations. TRE measures the effect of uncertainty in coregistrations at
all points of interest. In total, 5544 data sets with sensor-to-head and 128
head-to-MRI coregistrations, from a single MEG laboratory, were analyzed. An
adaptive Metropolis algorithm was used to estimate the optimal coregistration
and to sample the coregistration parameters (rotation and translation). We
found an average TRE between 1.3 and 2.3mm at the head surface. Further, we
observed a mean absolute difference in coregistration parameters between the
Metropolis and iterative closest point algorithm of (1.9 $\pm$ 1.5){\deg} and
(1.1 $\pm$ 0.9)mm. A paired sample t-test indicated a significant improvement
in goal function minimization by using the Metropolis algorithm. The sampled
parameters allowed computation of TRE on the entire grid of the MRI volume.
Hence, we recommend the Metropolis algorithm for head-to-MRI coregistrations.

stars and to determine their Ti isotopic abundances, to compare the TiO
isotopologues spectra computed using line lists by different authors.
  We fit theoretical synthetic spectra to the observed stellar molecular bands

determine Ti isotopic ratios in their atmospheres.
  We demonstrate the accuracy of the ExoMol {\sc Toto} line list for
differentisotopologues of TiO and the possibility of determining accurate Ti
isotope abundances in a numberof spectral ranges. The 7580--7594 \AA\ spectral
range seems particularly useful, with two atomic linesof Fe I and molecular
band heads of $^{50}Ti$O, $^{49}Ti$O, $^{48}Ti$O, $^{47}Ti$O clearly observable

7.9 :6.2 for GJ 15A and 7.4 : 4.2 : 76.6 : 5.8 : 6.0 for GJ 15B with accuracy
of order $\pm$ 0.2. [Ti] = 0.040 and 0.199 within accuracy $\pm$ 0.10 were also

high correlation ($0.86$) with actual transfer learning rankings, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods by a large margin ($10\%$) on the Taskonomy benchmark.

the mass range of the halos, $\Delta m_{t}$, for which the intrinsic spin
alignments with the minor tidal principal directions become as strong as that
with the intermediate principal directions. Then, utilizing the halo samples
from the DEUS simulations performed separately for the WMAP7 $\Lambda$CDM,
phantom DE and quintessence models, we investigate if and how the three
different dark energy models differ in $\Delta m_{t}$. It is shown that the
differences in $\Delta m_{t}$ among the three dark energy models are
significant enough to discriminate the models from one another and robust
against the variations of the smoothing scale of the tidal field and redshift.
Noting that a narrower spin transition zone is more powerful as a probe of dark
energy, we also show that the spin transition zones become narrower at higher
redshifts, in the filamentary environments and for the case that the tidal
fields are smoothed on the smaller scales. Our result is consistent with the
scenario that $\Delta m_{t}$ is mainly determined by how fast the nonlinear
evolution of the tidal field proceeds, which in turn sensitively depends on the

\ x$, then $map \ f : List \ A \rightarrow List \ B$ and $map \ g$ are also
extensionally equal. This suggests that preservation of extensional equality
could be a useful principle in verified generic programming. We explore this
possibility with a minimalist approach: we deal with (the lack of) extensional
equality in Martin-L\""of's intensional type theories without extending the
theories or using full-fledged setoids. Perhaps surprisingly, this minimal
approach turns out to be extremely useful. It allows one to derive simple
generic proofs of monadic laws but also verified, generic results in dynamical
systems and control theory. In turn, these results avoid tedious code
duplication and ad-hoc proofs. Thus, our work is a contribution towards
pragmatic, verified generic programming.

problems in science. In quantum mechanics, this question manifests itself in
the quantum marginal problem, which asks whether there is a global pure quantum
state for some given marginals. This problem arises in many contexts, ranging
from quantum chemistry to entanglement theory and quantum error correcting
codes. In this paper, we prove a correspondence of the marginal problem to the
separability problem. Based on this, we describe a sequence of semidefinite
programs which can decide whether some given marginals are compatible with some
pure global quantum state. As an application, we prove that the existence of
multiparticle absolutely maximally entangled states for a given dimension is
equivalent to the separability of an explicitly given two-party quantum state.
Finally, we show that the existence of quantum codes with given parameters can
also be interpreted as a marginal problem, hence, our complete hierarchy can
also be used.

analysis of complex-valued univariate or multivariate data. The new procedure
stems from a search on how to solve ambiguity problems in this analysis, such
as aliasing because of too coarsely sampled data, or collisions in projected
data, which may be solved by a translation of the sampling locations.
  In Section 2 both dilation and translation are first presented for the
classical one-dimensional exponential analysis. In the subsequent Sections 3--7
the paradigm is extended to more functions, among which the trigonometric
functions cosine, sine, the hyperbolic cosine and sine functions, the Chebyshev
and spread polynomials, the sinc, gamma and Gaussian function, and several
multivariate versions of all of the above.
  Each of these function classes needs a tailored approach, making optimal use
of the properties of the base function used in the considered sparse
interpolation problem. With each of the extensions a structured linear matrix
pencil is associated, immediately leading to a computational scheme for the
spectral analysis, involving a generalized eigenvalue problem and several
structured linear systems.
  In Section 8 we illustrate the new methods in several examples: fixed width
Gaussian distribution fitting, sparse cardinal sine or sinc interpolation, and
lacunary or supersparse Chebyshev polynomial interpolation.

is of paramount importance. Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are among the few
astrophysical sources capable of achieving the required energy to contribute to
such neutrino flux through p$\gamma$ interactions. In this work, ANTARES data
have been used to search for upward going muon neutrinos in spatial and
temporal coincidence with 784 GRBs occurred from 2007 to 2017. For each GRB,
the expected neutrino flux has been calculated in the framework of the internal
shock model and the impact of the lack of knowledge on the majority of source
redshifts and on other intrinsic parameters of the emission mechanism has been
quantified. It is found that the model parameters that set the radial distance
where shock collisions occur have the largest impact on neutrino flux
expectations. In particular, the bulk Lorentz factor of the source ejecta and
the minimum variability timescale are found to contribute significantly to the
GRB-neutrino flux uncertainty. For the selected sources, ANTARES data have been
analysed, by maximising the discovery probability of the stacking sample
through an extended maximum-likelihood strategy. Since no neutrino event passed
the quality cuts set by the optimisation procedure, 90\% confidence level upper
limits (with their uncertainty) on the total expected diffuse neutrino flux
have been derived, according to the model. The GRB contribution to the observed
diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux around 100 TeV is constrained to be less
than 10\%.

accurately. However, temporal-discriminative features can hardly be extracted

paper proposes a novel Video-based Temporal-Discriminative Learning (VTDL)
framework in self-supervised manner. Without labelled data for network
pretraining, temporal triplet is generated for each anchor video by using
segment of the same or different time interval so as to enhance the capacity
for temporal feature representation. Measuring temporal information by time
derivative, Temporal Consistent Augmentation (TCA) is designed to ensure that
the time derivative (in any order) of the augmented positive is invariant
except for a scaling constant. Finally, temporal-discriminative features are
learnt by minimizing the distance between each anchor and its augmented
positive, while the distance between each anchor and its augmented negative as
well as other videos saved in the memory bank is maximized to enrich the
representation diversity. In the downstream action recognition task, the
proposed method significantly outperforms existing related works. Surprisingly,
the proposed self-supervised approach is better than fully-supervised methods
on UCF101 and HMDB51 when a small-scale video dataset (with only thousands of

factor in many devices that are based on application of high electric fields
near their component surfaces. Understanding of processes that lead to
breakdown events may help mitigating their appearance and suggest ways for
improving operational efficiency of power-consuming devices. Stability of
surface performance at a given value of the electric field is affected by the
conditioning state, i.e. how long the surface was exposed to this field. Hence,
optimization of the surface conditioning procedure can significantly speed up
the preparatory steps for high-voltage applications. In this article, we use
pulsed dc systems to optimize the surface conditioning procedure of copper
electrodes, focusing on the effects of voltage recovery after breakdowns,
variable repetition rates as well as long waiting times between pulsing runs.
Despite the differences in the experimental scales, ranging from $10^{-4}$ s
between pulses, up to pulsing breaks of $10^5$ s, the experiments show that the
longer the idle time between the pulses, the more probable it is that the next
pulse produces a breakdown. We also notice that secondary breakdowns, i.e.
those which correlate with the previous ones, take place mainly during the
voltage recovery stage. We link these events with deposition of residual atoms
from vacuum on the electrode surfaces. Minimizing the number of pauses during
the voltage recovery stage reduces power losses due to secondary breakdown
events improving efficiency of the surface conditioning.

maximum order of a bramble in an undirected graph $G$ equals one plus the
treewidth of $G$. However, as shown by Grohe and Marx, brambles of high order

in $\Omega(n^{2\delta})$ for any fixed $\delta \in (0,\frac{1}{2}]$. On the

contained in at most two elements of the bramble (thus the bramble is of size
linear in its order). Second, we provide a tight upper bound for the lower

$G$ of treewidth at least $k$ contains a bramble of order

As usual, the declarative semantics can be expressed as a fixed point which,

of standard SLD resolution and coSLD resolution. We prove that the operational

diagnostic and predictor, but progress has been limited by ambiguities in its
definition; different conceptual boundaries of the climate system give rise to
different internal production rates. Three viable options are described,
estimated and investigated here, two of which -- the material and the total
radiative (here 'planetary') entropy production rates -- are well-established
and a third which has only recently been considered but appears very promising.
This new option is labelled the 'transfer' entropy production rate and includes
all irreversible processes that transfer heat within the climate, radiative and
material, but not those involved in the exchange of radiation with space.
Estimates in three model climates put the material rate in the range $27$-$48$
mW/m$^2$K, the transfer rate $67$-$76$ mW/m$^2$K, and the planetary rate
$1279$-$1312$ mW/m$^2$K.
  The climate-relevance of each rate is probed by calculating their responses
to climate changes in a simple radiative-convective model. An increased
greenhouse effect causes a significant increase in the material and transfer
entropy production rates but has no direct impact on the planetary rate. When
the same surface temperature increase is forced by changing the albedo instead,
the material and transfer entropy production rates increase less dramatically
and the planetary rate also registers an increase. This is pertinent to solar
radiation management as it demonstrates the difficulty of reversing greenhouse
gas-mediated climate changes by albedo alterations. It is argued that the
transfer perspective has particular significance in the climate system and
warrants increased prominence.

laser pulses with high-density plasmas can lead to the generation of strong
quasistatic magnetic fields via absorption of the photon angular momentum (so
called inverse Faraday effect). To achieve the magnetic field strength of
several Giga Gauss laser intensities $\simeq 10^{24}$W/cm$^2$ are required
which brings the interaction to the border between the classical and the
quantum regimes. We improve the classical modeling of the laser interaction
with overcritical plasma in the ""hole boring"" regime by using a modified
radiation friction force accounting for quantum recoil and spectral cut-off at
high energies. The results of analytical calculations and three-dimensional
particle-in-cell simulations show that, in foreseeable scenarios, the quantum
effects may lead to a decrease of the conversion rate of laser radiation into
high-energy photons by a factor 2-3. The magnetic field amplitude is suppressed
accordingly, and the magnetic field energy - by more than one order in
magnitude. This quantum suppression is shown to reach a maximum at a certain
value of intensity, and does not grow with the further increase of intensities.
The non monotonic behavior of the quantum suppression factor results from the
joint effect of the longitudinal plasma acceleration and the radiation reaction
force. The predicted features could serve as a suitable diagnostic for
radiation friction theories.

  in Sept. 2021",,,,"cs.LO","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In control theory, to solve a finite-horizon sequential decision problem
(SDP) commonly means to find a list of decision rules that result in an optimal
expected total reward (or cost) when taking a given number of decision steps.
SDPs are routinely solved using Bellman's backward induction. Textbook authors
(e.g. Bertsekas or Puterman) typically give more or less formal proofs to show
that the backward induction algorithm is correct as solution method for
deterministic and stochastic SDPs.
  Botta, Jansson and Ionescu propose a generic framework for finite horizon,
monadic SDPs together with a monadic version of backward induction for solving
such SDPs. In monadic SDPs, the monad captures a generic notion of uncertainty,
while a generic measure function aggregates rewards.
  In the present paper we define a notion of correctness for monadic SDPs and
identify three conditions that allow us to prove a correctness result for
monadic backward induction that is comparable to textbook correctness proofs
for ordinary backward induction. The conditions that we impose are fairly
general and can be cast in category-theoretical terms using the notion of
Eilenberg-Moore-algebra. They hold in familiar settings like those of
deterministic or stochastic SDPs but we also give examples in which they fail.
Our results show that backward induction can safely be employed for a broader
class of SDPs than usually treated in textbooks. However, they also rule out
certain instances that were considered admissible in the context of Botta et
al.'s generic framework.
  Our development is formalised in Idris as an extension of the Botta et al.
framework and the sources are available as supplementary material.

recombination front. We calculate light curves for Type IIP SNe interacting
with a CSM disk viewed from the polar direction, and examine the effects of the
disk density and opening angle on their bolometric light curves. This work
embeds the shock interaction model of Moriya, et al. (2013) within the Type IIP
SN model of Kasen & Woosley (2009), for taking into account the effects of the

after explosion (Phase 1), $\sim 10 - \sim 100$ days (Phase 2) and days after

cannot account for overluminous Type IIP SNe. We find that the luminosity ratio

GeoTree, which holds a collection of geohashes (string encodings of GPS

that returns a set of geohashes surrounding a given geohash in the GeoTree,
representing the approximate $k$-nearest neighbours of that geohash.
Furthermore, the GeoTree data structure retains $O\left(n\right)$ memory

focused on price comparison with historical neighbouring sales, demonstrating
an enhanced performance. The results show that this data structure allows for
the development of a real-time property price index, and can be scaled to

in order to constrain the physical parameters of the source. Methods. We
performed timing and spectral analysis of Chandra and XMM-Newton observations.
We used spectral models which assume the emission is from an accreting black
hole system. We fit the data with a multicolor disk (MCD) combined with a
powerlaw (PL) or a thermal Comptonization (NTHCOMP) component, and compared
those fits with a slim disk model. Results. The lightcurves of the source do
not show significant variability. From the hardness ratios (3-10 keV/0.3-3 keV
flux) we infer that the source is not spectrally variable. We found that the
photon index is tightly, positively correlated with the unabsorbed 0.3-10 keV
flux and the hydrogen column density. Furthermore, the temperature emissivity
profile indicates a deviation from the standard sub-Eddington thin disk model.
The source shows an inverse correlation between luminosity and inner disk
temperature in all fitted models. Conclusions. Our analysis favors the source
to be in an ultraluminous soft state. The positive correlations between the
photon index and the flux, and between the photon index and the hydrogen column
density may suggest the source is accreting at high Eddington ratios and might
indicate the presence of a wind. The inverse luminosity relation with the inner
disk temperature for all spectral models may indicate that the emission is
geometrically beamed by an optically thick outflow.

Born-Markov-secular master equation breaks down. Interestingly, the present
description of the dynamics is robust and it remains accurate even if some of

wavenumbers between 3 and 15 have been observed on the Sun with a dispersion
relation close to that of classical sectoral Rossby waves. The observed
vorticity eigenfunctions are symmetric in latitude, peak at the equator, switch
sign near $20^\circ$-$30^\circ$, and decrease at higher latitudes. We search
for an explanation that takes into account solar latitudinal differential
rotation. In the equatorial $\beta$ plane, we study the propagation of linear
Rossby waves (phase speed $c <0$) in a parabolic zonal shear flow, $U = -
\overline{U}\ \xi^2<0$, where $\overline{U} = 244$ m/s and $\xi$ is the sine of
latitude. In the inviscid case, the eigenvalue spectrum is real and continuous
and the velocity stream functions are singular at the critical latitudes where
$U = c$. We add eddy viscosity in the problem to account for wave attenuation.
In the viscous case, the stream functions are solution of a fourth-order
modified Orr-Sommerfeld equation. Eigenvalues are complex and discrete. For
reasonable values of the eddy viscosity corresponding to supergranular scales
and above (Reynolds number $100 \le Re \le 700$), all modes are stable. At
fixed longitudinal wavenumber, the least damped mode is a symmetric mode with a
real frequency close to that of the classical Rossby mode, which we call the R
mode. For $Re \approx 300$, the attenuation and the real part of the
eigenfunction is in qualitative agreement with the observations (unlike the
imaginary part of the eigenfunction, which has a larger amplitude in the model.
Conclusion: Each longitudinal wavenumber is associated with a latitudinally
symmetric R mode trapped at low latitudes by solar differential rotation. In
the viscous model, R modes transport significant angular momentum from the

sensors. Soft sensing is one of the significant applications of data-driven
methods in the condition monitoring of plants. While hard sensors can be easily
used in various plants, soft sensors are confined to the specific plant they
are designed for and cannot be used in a new plant or even used in some new
working conditions in the same plant. In this paper, a solution is proposed for
this underlying obstacle in data-driven condition monitoring systems.
Data-driven methods suffer from the fact that the distribution of the data by
which the models are constructed may not be the same as the distribution of the
data to which the model will be applied. This ultimately leads to the decline
of models accuracy. We proposed a new transfer learning (TL) based regression
method, called Domain Adversarial Neural Network Regression (DANN-R), and
employed it for designing transferable soft sensors. We used data collected
from the SCADA system of an industrial power plant to comprehensively
investigate the functionality of the proposed method. The result reveals that
the proposed transferable soft sensor can successfully adapt to new plants.

spectrum for 6G communication systems. The visible light spectrum which is a
part of the optical spectrum, can be used to provide communication and
illumination simultaneously. Visible light communication (VLC) systems have
been widely researched, however, little work has focused on the area of
multiple access. This chapter studies wavelength division multiple access
(WDMA) techniques in VLC systems to support multiple users. In addition, the
optimization of resource allocation is considered in this chapter by developing
a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model that can be used to maximize
the signal to noise and interference ratio (SINR) while supporting multiple
users. The optimized resource allocation results in the best assignment of
access points (APs) and wavelengths to users. Different indoor environments
such as office, data center and aircraft cabins are evaluated in this chapter.
A laser diode (LD) with four wavelengths (red, green, yellow and blue) is used
to provide high bandwidth for communication and white light for illumination.
Also, an angle diversity receiver (ADR) is utilized to receive signals and
reduce noise and interference by exploiting the spatial domain.

constraints in two-dimensional, non-holomorphic CFTs, making use of two main
mathematical results. First, we prove a theorem constraining the behavior near
the cusp of integral, vector-valued modular functions. Second, we explicitly
construct non-factorizable, non-holomorphic cuspidal functions satisfying

bootstrap-type bounds on OPE data of both rational and irrational CFTs,
including some powerful bounds for theories with conformal manifolds, as well
as insights into questions of spectral determinacy. We prove that in rational
CFT, the spectrum of operator twists $t\geq {c \over 12}$ is uniquely

similar to the stellar initial mass function (IMF), except for an offset
towards larger masses. This has led to the idea that there is a one-to-one
relation between cores and stars, such that the whole stellar mass reservoir is
contained in a gravitationally-bound prestellar core, as postulated by the
core-collapse model, and assumed in recent theoretical models of the stellar
IMF. We test the validity of this assumption by comparing the final mass of
stars with the mass of their progenitor cores in a high-resolution
star-formation simulation that generates a realistic IMF under physical
conditions characteristic of observed molecular clouds. Using a definition of
bound cores similar to previous works we obtain a CMF that converges with
increasing numerical resolution. We find that the CMF and the IMF are closely
related in a statistical sense only; for any individual star there is only a
weak correlation between the progenitor core mass and the final stellar mass.
In particular, for high mass stars only a small fraction of the final stellar
mass comes from the progenitor core, and even for low mass stars the fraction
is highly variable, with a median fraction of only about 50%. We conclude that
the core-collapse scenario and related models for the origin of the IMF are
incomplete. We also show that competitive accretion is not a viable
alternative.

surrounded by a layer of insulating material of thickness of size
$\varepsilon>0$, and whose conductivity is also proportional to $\varepsilon$.
This corresponds to the case of a small amount of insulating material, with

triggering mechanism for the onset of substorm and current disruption
initiation in the near-Earth magnetotail. Yet the stability of the kinetic
ballooning mode (KBM) in a global and realistic magnetotail configuration has
not been well examined. In this paper, stability of the KBM is evaluated for
the two-dimensional Voigt equilibrium of the near-Earth magnetotail based on an
analytical kinetic theory of ballooning instability in the framework of kinetic
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, where the kinetic effects such as the finite
gyroradius effect, wave-particle resonances, particle drifts motions are
included usually through kinetic closures. The growth rate of the KBM strongly
depends on the magnetic field line stiffening factor $S$, which is in turn
determined by the effects of the trapped electrons, the finite ion gyroradius,
and the magnetic drift motion of charged particles. The KBM is unstable in a
finite intermediate range of equatorial $\beta_{eq}$ and only marginally
unstable at higher $\beta_{eq}$ regime for higher $T_e/T_i$ values. The finite
ion gyroradius and the trapped electron fraction enhance the stiffening factor
that tends to stabilize the KBM in the magnetotail far away from Earth. On the
other hand, the current sheet thinning destabilizes KBM in the lower
$\beta_{eq}$ regime and stabilizes KBM in the higher $\beta_{eq}$ regime.

signal from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) to explore astrophysical models
which are inconsistent with the data. These upper limits are achieved using 298
h of carefully excised data over four observing seasons. To explore these upper
limits in the context of reionisation astrophysics, we use 21CMMC. We then
connect the disfavoured regions of parameter space to existing observational
constraints on reionisation such as high-$z$ galaxy ultra-violet (UV)
luminosity functions, background UV photoionisation rate, intergalactic medium
(IGM) neutral fraction, the electron scattering optical depth and the soft-band
X-ray emissivity. We find the vast majority of models disfavoured by the MWA
limits are already inconsistent with existing observational constraints. These
inconsistent models arise from two classes of models: (i) `cold' reionisation
and (ii) pure matter density fluctuations (i.e. no reionisation). However, a
small subsample of models are consistent implying the existing MWA limits
provide unique information in disfavouring models of reionisation, albeit
extremely weakly. We also provide the first limits on the soft-band X-ray
emissivity from galaxies at high redshifts, finding $1\sigma$ lower limits of
$\epsilon_{{\rm X},0.5-2~{\rm keV}}\gtrsim10^{34.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$.
Finally, we recover 95 per cent disfavoured limits on the IGM spin temperature
of $\bar{T}_{\rm S}\lesssim$ 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.8, 2.1, 2.4 K at $z=6.5, 6.8,

a slow and complicated manner called roaming, that is due to a mechanism
independent of the mechanisms for molecular and radical dissociation. While in
most molecules the conventional molecular mechanism dominates roaming,
acetaldehyde stands out by predominantly dissociating to products
characteristic for roaming. This work contributes to the discussion of the
prominence of roaming in (restricted) acetaldehyde from a dynamical systems
perspective. We find two mechanisms consisting of invariant phase space
structures that may lead to identical molecular products. One of them is a slow
passage via the flat region that fits the term frustrated dissociation used to
describe roaming and is similar to the roaming mechanism in formaldehyde. The
other mechanism is fast and avoids the flat region altogether. Trajectory

values of the excitation frequency. The authors also calculate the return time
of two successive EEs, defined as inter-event intervals, that follow

energy of the Lienard oscillator is estimated to explain the mechanism for the
development of EEs. Next, the authors confirmed the emergence of EEs in a
parametrically excited microelectromechanical system. In this model, EEs occur
due to the appearance of stick-slip bifurcation near the discontinuous boundary

real-world engineering models, like macro and micromechanical oscillators, the

approximate simulator of real-time quantum field dynamics at finite
temperatures. We consider $N$ classical field configurations dubbed as replicas
which interact with each other via the $\tau$-derivative terms and evolve with
the classical equation of motion. The partition function of replicas is found
to be proportional to that of quantum field in the imaginary time formalism. As
the replica index $\tau$ can be regarded as the imaginary time index, the
replica evolution is technically the same as the molecular dynamics part of the
hybrid Monte-Carlo sampling and the replica configurations should reproduce the
correct quantum equilibrium distribution after the long-time evolution. At the
same time, evolution of the replica-index average of field variables is
described by the classical equation of motion when the fluctuations are small.
In order to examine the real-time propagation properties of replicas, we first
discuss replica evolution in quantum mechanics. Statistical averages of
observables are precisely obtained by the initial condition average of replica
evolution, and the time evolution of the unequal-time correlation function,
$\langle x(t) x(t')\rangle$, in a harmonic oscillator is also described well by
the replica evolution in the range $T/\omega > 0.5$. Next, we examine the
statistical and dynamical properties of the $\phi^4$ theory in the 4+1
dimensional spacetime, which contains three spatial, one replica index or the
imaginary time, and one real-time. We note that the Rayleigh-Jeans divergence
can be removed in replica evolution with $N \geq 2$ when the mass counterterm
is taken into account. We also find that the thermal mass obtained from the
unequal-time correlation function at zero momentum grows as a function of the
coupling as in the perturbative estimate in the small coupling region.

currently of great importance in image processing for remote sensing
applications. However, it is a challenging task due to two main reasons.
Firstly, the label information is difficult to acquire due to high annotation
costs. Secondly, the speckle effect embedded in the PolSAR imaging process
remarkably degrades the segmentation performance. To address these two issues,
we present a contextual PolSAR image semantic segmentation method in this
paper.With a newly defined channelwise consistent feature set as input, the
three-dimensional discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) technique is employed to
extract discriminative multi-scale features that are robust to speckle noise.
Then Markov random field (MRF) is further applied to enforce label smoothness
spatially during segmentation. By simultaneously utilizing 3D-DWT features and
MRF priors for the first time, contextual information is fully integrated
during the segmentation to ensure accurate and smooth segmentation. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive
experiments on three real benchmark PolSAR image data sets. Experimental
results indicate that the proposed method achieves promising segmentation
accuracy and preferable spatial consistency using a minimal number of labeled
pixels.
