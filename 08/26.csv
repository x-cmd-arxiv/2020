endeavor in the field of quantum optics and quantum information processing.
Here we propose a novel hybrid optoelectromechanical platform that integrates a
cavity system with a hybrid electromechanical probe for QND photon counting.
Building upon a mechanical-mode-mediated nonperturbative electro-optical
dispersive coupling, our protocol performs the QND photon counting measurement
by means of the current-voltage characteristics of the probe. In particular, we
show that the peak voltage shift of the differential conductance is linearly
dependent on the photon occupation number, thus providing a sensitive measure
of the photon number, especially in the strong optomechanical coupling regime.
Given that our proposed hybrid system is compatible with state-of-the-art
experimental techniques, we discuss its implementations and anticipate
applications in quantum optics and polariton physics.

a factor $\mathcal{O}(10^2)-\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, depending on the redshift bin,

consistent with forthcoming spectroscopic and photometric galaxy surveys like
the Euclid satellite and the Square Kilometre Array (phase 1), we show: that
given a single redshift bin, spectroscopic surveys outperform photometric
surveys; and that -- due to shot-noise and redshift bin width balance -- bins
at redshifts $z\sim1$ bring higher cumulative SNR than bins at lower redshifts
$z \sim 0.5$. Our results for the largest cumulative SNR $\sim 15$ suggest that
the harmonic-space bispectrum is detectable within narrow ($\Delta z \sim
0.01$) spectroscopic redshift bins even when including only mildly non-linear

whose central galaxy population shows high star formation compared to lower-z

YJ-, H- bands spectroscopic data have been analyzed, together with deep
archival HST photometric data in F105W, F140W, and F160W bands, Chandra X-ray,
radio JVLA data at 1-2 GHz, and ALMA band-6 observations. In the central region
of the cluster (~70x70 kpc^2), 2 systems of interacting galaxies have been
identified and studied (Complex A and B), with a total of 7 confirmed cluster
members. These galaxies show perturbed morphologies and 3 of them show signs of
AGN activity. In particular, 2 type-1 AGN with typical broad lines have been
found at the center of each complex (both of them X-ray obscured and highly
accreting; Eddington ratio ~0.5), while a type-2 AGN has been discovered in
Complex A. The AGN at the center of Complex B is also detected in X-ray while
the other 2 are spatially related to radio emission. The 3 AGN provide one of
the closest AGN triple at z>1 revealed so far with a minimum(maximum) projected
distance of ~10(40) kpc. The observation of high star formation, merger
signatures and nuclear activity in the core of XDCP0044 suggests that all these
processes are key ingredients in shaping the nascent BCG. According to our

study of flow and heat transfer through a curved duct has attracted
considerable attention to the researchers. In this paper, a comprehensive
numerical study is presented for the fully developed two-dimensional flow of
viscous incompressible fluid through a curved square duct for various
curvatures. The spectral method is used as a basic tool to solve the system of
nonlinear partial differential equations. Numerical calculations are carried
out over a wide range of the Dean number, $0<D_n\le 5000$, for curvature ratio
$\delta =0.001$, $0.1$, and $0.5$. A temperature difference is applied across
the horizontal walls for the Grashof number $Gr = 1000$, where the bottom wall
is heated while cooling from the ceiling, the outer and inner walls being
thermally insulated. First, the bifurcation structure of steady solutions is
investigated. As a result, two branches of steady solutions consisting of two-
to eight-vortex solutions are obtained for $\delta =0.001$ and $0.1$ while
three branches for $\delta =0.5$. Then we performed time evolution calculation
to investigate unsteady flow characteristics, and it is found that the unsteady
flow undergoes through various flow instabilities, if $D_n$ is increased. Flow
transitions are well determined by obtaining phase space of the time evolution
results. Typical contours of streamlines and isotherms are obtained at several
values of $D_n$ and it is found that the unsteady flow consists of
two-to-eight-vortex solutions. The present study demonstrates the role of
secondary vortices on convective heat transfer and it is found that convective
heat transfer is significantly enhanced by the secondary flow and as the number
of secondary vortices increases, that occurs for the chaotic solution, heat
transfer is boosted substantially.

series rather than Taylor series known from differential calculus, and also
works in cases where the Taylor expansion fails. For a function of number
operators, such an expansion is automatically normal ordered. Applied to the
Holstein-Primakoff representation of spins, the scheme yields an exact series
expansion with a finite number of terms and, in addition, allows for a
systematic expansion of the spin operators that respects the spin commutation
relations within a truncated part of the full Hilbert space. Furthermore, the
Newton series expansion strongly facilitates the calculation of expectation
values with respect to coherent states. As a third example, we show that
factorial moments and factorial cumulants arising in the context of photon or
electron counting are a natural consequence of Newton series expansions.
Finally, we elucidate the connection between normal ordering, Taylor and Newton
series by determining a corresponding integral transformation, which is related
to the Mellin transform.

utilize their local datasets to collaboratively train a global model with the
help of a remote parameter server (PS). The PS has access to the global model
and shares it with the devices for local training, and the devices return the
result of their local updates to the PS to update the global model. This
framework requires downlink transmission from the PS to the devices and uplink
transmission from the devices to the PS. The goal of this study is to
investigate the impact of the bandwidth-limited shared wireless medium in both
the downlink and uplink on the performance of FL with a focus on the downlink.
To this end, the downlink and uplink channels are modeled as fading broadcast
and multiple access channels, respectively, both with limited bandwidth. For
downlink transmission, we first introduce a digital approach, where a
quantization technique is employed at the PS to broadcast the global model
update at a common rate such that all the devices can decode it. Next, we
propose analog downlink transmission, where the global model is broadcast by
the PS in an uncoded manner. We consider analog transmission over the uplink in
both cases. We further analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed analog
approach assuming that the uplink transmission is error-free. Numerical
experiments show that the analog downlink approach provides significant
improvement over the digital one, despite a significantly lower transmit power
at the PS. The experimental results corroborate the convergence results, and
show that a smaller number of local iterations should be used when the data
distribution is more biased, and also when the devices have a better estimate

both the slow and fast particles perform independent particle quantum walks
when the interaction between them is weak. However, stronger inter-particle
interactions result in quantum walks by the repulsively bound pair formed
between the two particles. For different initial states when the walkers are on
different sites initially, the quantum walk performed by the slow particle is
almost independent of that of the fast particle, which exhibits reflected and
transmitted components across the particle with large hopping strength for weak
interactions. Beyond a critical value of the interaction strength, the wave
function of the fast particle ceases to penetrate through the slow particle
signalling a spatial phase separation. However, when the two particles are
initially at the two opposite edges of the lattice, then the interaction
facilitates the complete reflection of both of them from each other. We analyze
the above mentioned features by examining various physical quantities such as
the on-site density evolution, two-particle correlation functions and

Hausdorff dimension of the invariant set of an iterated function system or IFS.
In this paper, we extend this approach to incorporate high order approximation
methods. We again rely on the fact that we can associate to the IFS a
parametrized family of positive, linear, Perron-Frobenius operators $L_s$, an
idea known in varying degrees of generality for many years. Although $L_s$ is
not compact in the setting we consider, it possesses a strictly positive $C^m$
eigenfunction $v_s$ with eigenvalue $R(L_s)$ for arbitrary $m$ and all other
points $z$ in the spectrum of $L_s$ satisfy $|z| \le b$ for some constant $b <
R(L_s)$. Under appropriate assumptions on the IFS, the Hausdorff dimension of
the invariant set of the IFS is the value $s=s_*$ for which $R(L_s) =1$. This
eigenvalue problem is then approximated by a collocation method at the extended
Chebyshev points of each subinterval using continuous piecewise polynomials of
arbitrary degree $r$. Using an extension of the Perron theory of positive
matrices to matrices that map a cone $K$ to its interior and explicit a priori
bounds on the derivatives of the strictly positive eigenfunction $v_s$, we give
rigorous upper and lower bounds for the Hausdorff dimension $s_*$, and these
bounds converge rapidly to $s_*$ as the mesh size decreases and/or the
polynomial degree increases.

specially in the case of complex spectra. Here we study the spectra of directed
networks using the recently introduced ratios between nearest- and

accordance with undirected random networks. Furthermore, by calculating the
average spacing ratio as a function of the average degree, we show that the

and energetic lives, and many of them inevitably explode as a supernova and
become a neutron star or black hole. In turn, the formation, evolution and
explosive deaths of massive stars impact the surrounding interstellar medium
and shape the evolution of their host galaxies. Yet the chemical and dynamical
evolution of a massive star, including the chemical yield of the ultimate
supernova and the remnant mass of the compact object, strongly depend on the
interior physics of the progenitor star. We currently lack empirically
calibrated prescriptions for various physical processes at work within massive
stars, but this is now being remedied by asteroseismology. The study of stellar
structure and evolution using stellar oscillations - asteroseismology - has
undergone a revolution in the last two decades thanks to high-precision time
series photometry from space telescopes. In particular, the long-term light
curves provided by the MOST, CoRoT, BRITE, Kepler/K2 and TESS missions provided
invaluable data sets in terms of photometric precision, duration and frequency
resolution to successfully apply asteroseismology to massive stars and probe
their interior physics. The observation and subsequent modelling of stellar
pulsations in massive stars has revealed key missing ingredients in stellar
structure and evolution models of these stars. Thus asteroseismology has opened
a new window into calibrating stellar physics within a highly degenerate part
of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. In this review, I provide a historical
overview of the progress made using ground-based and early space missions, and
discuss more recent advances and breakthroughs in our understanding of massive

case of squarefree, smooth moduli this improves upon previous work of Nunes, in
which $196/261 = 0.75096...$ was replaced by $25/36 = 0.69\bar{4}$. This also
establishes a level of distribution for a positive density set of moduli that
improves upon a result of Hooley. We show more generally that one can break the
$X^{3/4}$-barrier for a density 1 set of $X^{\eta}$-smooth moduli $q$ (without

In this work, we discuss how an extensive set of strictly local dynamical
symmetries can exist in an interacting many-body quantum system. These strictly
local dynamical symmetries lead to spontaneous breaking of continuous
time-translation symmetry, i.e. the formation of extremely robust and
persistent oscillations when an infinitesimal time-dependent perturbation is
applied to an arbitrary initial (stationary) state. Observables which do not
overlap with the local (dynamical) symmetry operators can relax, losing memory
of their initial conditions. The remaining observables enter highly robust
non-equilibrium limit cycles, signaling the emergence of a non-trivial
\emph{quantum many-body attractor}. We provide an explicit recipe for
constructing Hamiltonians featuring local dynamical symmetries. As an example,
we introduce the XYZ spin-lace model, which is a model of a quasi-1D quantum
magnet.

goal of neuroscience. In many situatons, the relative phase difference,
together with coherence patterns, have been employed to infer the direction of
the information flow. However, it has been recently shown in local field
potential data from monkeys the existence of a synchronized regime in which
unidirectionally coupled areas can present both positive and negative phase
differences. During the counterintuitive regime, called anticipated
synchronization (AS), the phase difference does not reflect the causality. Here
we investigate coherence and causality at the alpha frequency band (10 Hz)
between pairs of electroencephalogram (EEG) electrodes in humans during a
GO/NO-GO task. We show that human EEG signals can exhibit anticipated
synchronization, which is characterized by a unidirectional influence from an
electrode A to an electrode B, but the electrode B leads the electrode A in
time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first verification of AS in EEG
signals and in the human brain. The usual delayed synchronization (DS) regime
is also present between many pairs. DS is characterized by a unidirectional
influence from an electrode A to an electrode B and a positive phase difference
between A and B which indicates that the electrode A leads the electrode B in
time. Moreover, we show that EEG signals exhibit diversity in phase relations:
the pairs of electrodes can present in-phase, anti-phase, or out-of-phase
synchronization with a similar distribution of positive and negative phase
differences.

wealthier white residents. Finally, there are considerable discrepancies in
terms of departure and return times by race and wealth, with strong social
cohesion among evacuees from advantaged neighborhoods in their destination

evacuations, providing policy recommendations for residents, decision makers,

distribution models for the Milky Way's dark matter (DM) halo which are

analysis. By using broad priors on the individual galactic components, we
derive conservative estimates for the astrophysical factors entering the
interpretation of direct and indirect DM searches. While the resulting DM
density profiles are in good agreement with previous studies, implying
$\rho_\odot \approx 10^{-2} \, M_\odot / \mathrm{pc}^3$, the presence of
baryonic disc leads to significant differences in the local DM velocity
distribution in comparison with the standard halo model. For direct detection,
this implies roughly 30% stronger cross-section limits at DM masses near
detectors maximum sensitivity and up to an order of magnitude weaker limits at
the lower end of the mass range. Furthermore, by performing Monte-Carlo
simulations for the upcoming DARWIN and DarkSide-20k experiments, we
demonstrate that upon successful detection of heavy DM with coupling just below
the current limits, the carefully constructed axisymmetric models can eliminate
bias and reduce uncertainties by more then 50% in the reconstructed DM coupling
and mass, but also help in a more reliable determination of the scattering
operator. Furthermore, the velocity anisotropies induced by the baryonic disc
can lead to significantly larger annual modulation amplitude and sizable
differences in the directional distribution of the expected DM-induced events.
For indirect searches, we provide the differential $J$-factors and compute
several moments of the relative velocity distribution that are needed for
predicting the rate of velocity-dependent annihilations. However, we find that
accurate predictions are still hindered by large uncertainties regarding the DM

the recent decades, is receiving wide attention due to its very significant
adverse effects on climate. Whether global warming will continue even in the
future, is a question that is most important to investigate. In this regard,
the so-called general circulation models (GCMs) have attempted to project the
future climate, and nearly all of them exhibit alarming rates of global
temperature rise in the future.
  Although global warming in the current time frame is undeniable, it is
important to assess the validity of the future predictions of the GCMs. In this
article, we attempt such a study using our recently-developed Bayesian multiple
testing paradigm for model selection in inverse regression problems. The model
we assume for the global temperature time series is based on Gaussian process
emulation of the black box scenario, realistically treating the dynamic
evolution of the time series as unknown.
  We apply our ideas to datasets available from the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) website. The best GCM models selected by our method under
different assumptions on future climate change scenarios do not convincingly
support the present global warming pattern when only the future predictions are
considered known. Using our Gaussian process idea, we also forecast the future
temperature time series given the current one. Interestingly, our results do
not support drastic future global warming predicted by almost all the GCM
models.

the high channel dimension and the lack of Uplink-Downlink (UL-DL) channel
reciprocity in FDD mode. In particular, the difficulty arises in channel
covariance acquisition for both UL and DL transmissions and in common training
of DL channels in a multi-user setup. To overcome these challenges, we develop
a unified framework consisting of three steps: (1) a covariance estimation
method to efficiently estimate the UL covariance from noisy, orthogonal UL
pilots; (2) a UL-DL covariance transformation method that obtains the DL
covariance from the estimated UL covariance in the previous step; (3) a
multi-user common DL channel training with limited DL pilot dimension method,
which enables the BS to estimate effective user DL channels and use them for
interference-free DL beamforming and data transmission. We provide extensive

corollaries. For example, non-detection up to forecast sensitivities would tell
us that PBHs larger than a fraction of a solar mass can constitute no more than
a negligible fraction of dark matter. Moreover, non-detection will also rule
out the scenario that PBHs generated by primordial overdensities could be the
progenitors of super-massive black holes (SMBHs), of topical interest as there
are only a few widely accepted proposals for the formation of SMBHs, an even
more pressing question after the detection of active galactic nuclei over a
billion solar masses at redshifts $z \geq 7$. Finally, non-detection sets the
strongest bounds on the amplitude of small scale inflationary fluctuations for
over 6 decades.

bias-aware learner to map inputs to a semantic embedding space for generalized
zero-shot learning. During training, the model learns to regress to real-valued
class prototypes in the embedding space with temperature scaling, while a
margin-based bidirectional entropy term regularizes seen and unseen
probabilities. Relying on a real-valued semantic embedding space provides a
versatile approach, as the model can operate on different types of semantic
information for both seen and unseen classes. Experiments are carried out on
four benchmarks for generalized zero-shot learning and demonstrate the benefits
of the proposed bias-aware classifier, both as a stand-alone method or in
combination with generated features.

strong CP problem and that may also address the cosmological matter-antimatter
asymmetry. Axion-photon conversion is possible in the presence of the strong
magnetic fields, and the photon so produced will have energy equal to the axion
mass. Here we report new limits on axionic dark matter obtained from radio
spectra of the Galactic Center magnetar PSR J1745-2900. The magnetar has a
magnetic field of $1.6\times10^{14}$ G that interacts with a dark matter
density $2\times10^5$ to $2\times10^9$ times greater than the local dark matter
encountered by terrestrial haloscopes, depending on the Galactic dark matter
profile. No significant spectral features are detected across 62% of the axion
mass range 4.1-165.6 $\mu$eV (1-40 GHz). The interpretation of flux limits into
limits on the two-photon coupling strength $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$ depends on the
magnetospheric conversion model and on the dark matter density at the Galactic
Center. For a standard dark matter profile, we exclude axion models with
$g_{a\gamma\gamma}> $ 6-34 $\times 10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ with 95% confidence

A*, these limits reduce to $g_{a\gamma\gamma} > $ 6-34 $ \times10^{-14}$
GeV$^{-1}$, which exclude some theoretical models for masses $> 33$ $\mu$eV.
Limits may be improved by modeling stimulated axion conversion, by ray-tracing
conversion pathways in the magnetar magnetosphere, and by obtaining deeper
broad-band observations of the magnetar.

and crystalline igneous rock can enhance permeability by reactivation and shear
dilation of existing fractures. The process is characterized by interaction
between fluid flow, deformation, and the fractured structure of the formation.
The flow is highly affected by the fracture network, which in turn is deformed
because of hydromechanical stress changes caused by the fluid injection. This
process-structure interaction is decisive for the outcome of hydraulic
stimulation, and, in analysis of governing mechanisms, physics-based modeling
has potential to complement field and experimental data. Here, we show how
recently developed simulation technology is a valuable tool to understand
governing mechanisms of hydromechanical coupled processes and the reactivation

the faults, including dilation because of slip. Key elements are high aspect

to a scalable approach that obtains teams within reasonable time over very
large networks. Further, for one task our algorithms TFC-R and TFC-N generate
multiple teams from the communities which is show-cased as a case-study in the

the task is considered as writing a research paper and the words of the title

possible authors for the given paper, who have the required skills and having
least communication cost. In the process, we build a much larger bench-mark

worst-case estimate of the privacy loss over all individuals and all possible

approach is overly conservative, especially for ""typical"" data points which
incur little privacy loss by participation in most of the analyses. In this
work, we give a method for tighter privacy loss accounting based on the value
of a personalized privacy loss estimate for each individual in each analysis.
To implement the accounting method we design a filter for R\'enyi differential
privacy. A filter is a tool that ensures that the privacy parameter of a
composed sequence of algorithms with adaptively-chosen privacy parameters does
not exceed a pre-specified budget. Our filter is simpler and tighter than the
known filter for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy by Rogers et al. We
apply our results to the analysis of noisy gradient descent and show that
personalized accounting can be practical, easy to implement, and can only make

In this paper, we give an explicit proof that the so-called pretty good
measurement, or square-root measurement, is optimal for the PBT protocol with
independent copies of maximally entangled states as the port state. We then
show that the very same measurement remains optimal even when the port state is
optimized to yield the best possible PBT protocol. Hence, there is one
particular pretty good measurement achieving the optimal performance in both
cases. The following well-known facts are key ingredients in the proofs of
these results: (i) the natural symmetries of PBT, leading to a description in
terms of representation-theoretic data; (ii) the operational equivalence of PBT
with certain state discrimination problems, which allows us to employ duality
of the associated semidefinite programs. Along the way, we rederive the
representation-theoretic formulas for the performance of PBT protocols proved

protoplanetary disks (PPDs), from driving the collisions and the diffusion of
dust grains, to the concentration of pebbles in giant vortices, thus,
facilitating planetesimal formation. The Vertical Shear Instability (VSI) is a
hydrodynamic mechanism, operating in PPDs if the local rate of thermal
relaxation is high enough. Previous studies of the VSI have, however, relied on
the assumption of constant cooling rates, or neglected the finite coupling time
between the gas particles and the dust grains. Here, we present the results of
hydrodynamic simulations of PPDs with the PLUTO code that include a more
realistic thermal relaxation prescription, which enables us to study the VSI in
the optically thick and optically thin parts of the disk under consideration of
the thermal dust-gas coupling. We show the VSI to cause turbulence even in the
optically thick inner regions of PPDs in our two- and three-dimensional
simulations. The collisional decoupling of dust and gas particles in the upper
atmosphere and the correspondingly inefficient thermal relaxation rates lead to
the damping of the VSI turbulence. Long-lived anticyclonic vortices form in our
three-dimensional simulation. These structures emerge from the turbulence in
the VSI-active layer, persist over hundreds of orbits and extend vertically
over the whole extent of the turbulent region. We conclude that the VSI leads
to turbulence and the formation of long-lived dust traps within $\pm$3 pressure
scale heights distance from the disk midplane

this work, analytical expressions have been derived to specify ER and EV for
N-bin dust schemes based on the model calculated dust mixing ratio. Numerical

the atmospheric radiation and their interaction. The results have revealed some
interesting features of the dust distribution parameters such as the seasonal

minimal set of training examples and progressively chooses informative samples

component of an active learning system is a mechanism to estimate model
uncertainty, which is then used to pick uncertain, informative samples. We
study different mechanisms to capture and quantify this uncertainty when
working with deep networks, based on the variance or entropy across explicit or

the robust zero-energy topological boundary modes manifest through a large
boundary impedance, when the circuit is tuned to the resonance frequency. The
simplicity of our circuit constructions is based on the fact that the existence
of the boundary modes relies only on the Clifford algebra of the corresponding
Hermitian matrices entering the Hamiltonian and not on their particular
representation. This in turn enables us to implement a wide class of
topological models through rather simple topolectric circuits with nodes
consisting of only two subnodes. We anchor these outcomes from the numerical
computation of the on-resonance impedance in circuit realizations of
first-order ($m=1$), such as Chern and quantum spin Hall insulators, and
second- ($m=2$) and third- ($m=3$) order topological insulators in different
dimensions, featuring sharp localization on boundaries of codimensionality
$d_c=m$. Finally, we subscribe to the \emph{stacked topolectric circuit}
construction to engineer three-dimensional Weyl, nodal-loop, quadrupolar Dirac
and Weyl semimetals, respectively displaying surface and hinge localized
impedance.

around Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (UDGs), we simulate globular cluster populations
hosted by UDGs formed through tidal heating. Specifically, globular cluster
(GC) formation is modeled as occurring in regions of dense star formation.
Because star-formation-rate-densities are higher at high redshift, dwarf
galaxies in massive galaxy clusters, which formed most of their stars at high
redshift, form a large fraction of their stars in globular clusters. Given that
UDGs formed through environmental processes are more likely to be accreted at
high redshift, these systems have more GCs than non-UDGs. In particular, our
model predicts that massive UDGs have twice the GC mass of non-UDGs of similar
stellar mass, in rough agreement with observations. Although this effect is
somewhat diminished by GC disruption, we find that the relationship between GC
mass fraction and cluster-centric distance, and the relationship between GC
mass fraction and galaxy half-light radius are remarkably similar to
observations. Among our model objects, both UDGs and non-UDGs present a
correlation between halo mass and GC mass, although UDGs have lower dynamical
masses at a given GC mass. Furthermore, because of the effectiveness of GC
disruption, we predict that GCs around UDGs should have a more top heavy mass
function than GCs around non-UDGs. This analysis suggests that dwarfs with
older stellar populations, such as UDGs, should have higher globular cluster
mass fractions than objects with young stellar populations, such as isolated
dwarfs.

fully half our faint radio sample, indicating a source density of one AGN
arcmin$^{-2}$, with a similar number of radio-undetected AGN identified via

radio emission consistent with being powered predominantly by star formation.
Nevertheless, we find AGN radio signatures in our sample: $\sim12\%$ with radio
excess indicating radio-loud activity and $\sim16\%$ of radio-quiet AGN
candidates with flat or inverted radio spectra. The latter is a lower limit,

close to unity. The updated model can be instrumental in searching for
short-period binaries with compact-object secondaries in large data sets of

Renyi entropy is the sum of two terms: (a) Renyi entropy of this effective

determine the self consistent equation for this effective potential within a

observed the frequency of the jet spectral break, which corresponds to the most
compact region in the jet where particle acceleration begins (higher
frequencies indicate closer to the black hole), evolve from the IR band into
the radio band (decreasing by $\approx$3 orders of magnitude) in less than a
day. During one observational epoch, we found evidence of the jet spectral
break evolving in frequency through the radio band. Estimating the magnetic

of the high-energy jet emission was not consistent with radiative cooling;
instead the particle acceleration region seems to be moving away from the black
hole on approximately dynamical timescales. This result suggests that the
compact jet quenching is not caused by local changes to the particle
acceleration, rather we are observing the acceleration region of the jet
travelling away from the black hole with the jet flow. Spectral analysis of the

a complete microscopic derivation for finite temperature and constant

intraband and interband contributions that are defined by the involved
quasiparticle spectral functions. On the other hand, we distinguish symmetric

intraband contributions generalize the formula of standard Boltzmann transport
theory, which is valid only in the clean limit (small $\Gamma$), whereas the
interband contributions capture interband coherence effects beyond independent
quasiparticles. We show that the symmetric interband contribution is a
correction only present for finite $\Gamma$ and is controlled by the quantum

surface roughness. Scatterometers operating at moderate and high incidence

electromagnetic (EM) wavelengths. The integrated surface roughness is generally
expressed as the lowpass mean square slope (LPMSS). Tilting modification of the
local incidence angle for the specular facets located on slanted background
surfaces is an important factor in relating the LPMSS and microwave specular
returns. For very high wind condition, it is necessary to consider the
modification of relative permittivity by air in foam and whitecaps produced by
wave breaking. This paper describes the application of these considerations to
monostatic and bistatic microwave specular returns from the ocean surface.
Measurements from Ku band altimeters and L band reflectometers are used for

context of structural systems since the latest survey by Dion et al. in 2003.
We systematically consider all the papers that cite this survey as well as the
seminal work in this field that took place on and after the publication of the
later survey, are published in peer-reviewed venues and in English. Structural
systems theory deals with parametric systems where parameters might be unknown
and, therefore, addresses the study of systems properties that depend only on
the system's structure (or topology) described by the inter-dependencies
between state variables. Remarkably, structural systems properties hold
generically (i.e., almost always) under the assumption that parameters are
independent. Therefore, it constitutes an approach to assess necessary
conditions that systems should satisfy. In recent years, structural systems
theory was applied to design systems that attain such properties, as well as to
endure resilient/security and privacy properties. Furthermore, structural
systems theory enables the formulation of such topics as combinatorial
optimization problems, which allow us to understand their computational
complexity and find algorithms that are efficiently deployed in the context of
large-scale systems. In particular, we present an overview of how structural
systems theory has been used in the context of linear time-invariant systems,
as well as other dynamical models, for which a brief description of the
different problem statements and solutions approaches are presented. Next, we
describe recent variants of structural systems theory, as well as different

increasingly available with the deployment of numerous small satellites and
drones. However, analyzing such imagery data to extract flood extent poses
unique challenges due to the rich noise and shadows, obstacles (e.g., tree
canopies, clouds), and spectral confusion between pixel classes (flood, dry)
due to spatial heterogeneity. Existing machine learning techniques often focus
on spectral and spatial features from raster images without fully incorporating
the geographic terrain within classification models. In contrast, we recently
proposed a novel machine learning model called geographical hidden Markov tree
that integrates spectral features of pixels and topographic constraints from
Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data (i.e., water flow directions) in a holistic
manner. This paper evaluates the model through case studies on high-resolution
aerial imagery from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
National Geodetic Survey together with DEM. Three scenes are selected in
heavily vegetated floodplains near the cities of Grimesland and Kinston in

black holes (SMBHs) are rapidly accumulating as optical surveys improve. These
detections may provide constraints on SMBH demographics, stellar dynamics, and
stellar evolution in galaxies. To maximize this scientific impact, we require a
better understanding of how astrophysical parameters interact with survey
selection effects in setting the properties of detected flares. We develop a
framework for modeling the distributions of optical TDF detections in surveys
across attributes of the host galaxies and the flares themselves. This model
folds in effects of the stellar disruption rate in each galaxy, the flare
luminosity and temperature distributions, the effects of obscuration and
reddening by dust in the host galaxy, and survey selection criteria. We
directly apply this model to the sample of TDFs detected by the Zwicky
Transient Facility and find that the overall flare detection rate is in line
with simple theoretical expectation. The model can also reproduce the
distribution of total stellar mass and redshift of the host galaxies, but fails
to match all details of the detected flares, such as their luminosity and
temperature distributions. We also find that dust obscuration likely plays an
important role in suppressing the TDF detection rate in star-forming galaxies.
While we do not find that the unusual preference of TDFs to have hosts in
post-starburst galaxies in the ""green valley"" can be entirely explained by
selection effects, our model can help to quantify the true rate enhancement in
those galaxies.

understanding the violent processes responsible for their acceleration is
identifying which classes of astrophysical objects (active galactic nuclei or
starburst galaxies, for example) correlate to their arrival directions. While
source clustering is limited by deflections in the Galactic magnetic field, at
the highest energies the scattering angles are sufficiently low to retain
correlation with source catalogues. While there have been several studies
attempting to identify source catalogue correlations with data from the Pierre
Auger Observatory and the Telescope Array, the significance above an isotropic
background has not yet reached the threshold for discovery. It has been known
for several decades that a full-sky UHECR observatory would provide a
substantial increase in sensitivity to the anisotropic component of UHECRs.

fluorescence detection in the Earth's atmosphere from orbit. In this white

Experiments are complimented by shock-resolved viscous simulations of triple

lowered, and as the Mach number and Reynolds number are increased, the forward
jet approaches the Mach stem, forms a vortex, deforms the shock front and in
some cases bifurcates the Mach stem. Experiments show Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities in the vortex cause large-scale convective mixing behind the Mach
stem at low isentropic exponents ($\gamma \le 1.15$). The limits of Mach stem
bifurcation (triple Mach-White reflection) in inviscid simulations are plotted

exponent of $\gamma \approx 1.3$ is found beyond which bifurcation does not

social media before it is medically defined, formally documented or

vaguely defined in medical literature. Objectives: The objective of this study
is to construct a data analysis pipeline to understand emerging illness using
social media data, and to apply the pipeline to understand key attributes of
BII. Methods: We conducted a pipeline of social media data analysis using
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and topic modeling. We extracted mentions
related to signs/symptoms, diseases/disorders and medical procedures using the
Clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES) from social
media data. We mapped the mentions to standard medical concepts. We summarized
mapped concepts to topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). Finally, we
applied this pipeline to understand BII from several BII-dedicated social media
sites. Results: Our pipeline identified topics related to toxicity, cancer and
mental health issues that are highly associated with BII. Our pipeline also
shows that cancers, autoimmune disorders and mental health problems are
emerging concerns associated with breast implants based on social media
discussions. The pipeline also identified mentions such as rupture, infection,
pain and fatigue as common self-reported issues among the public, as well as
toxicity from silicone implants. Conclusions: Our study could inspire future
work studying the suggested symptoms and factors of BII. Our study provides the
first analysis and derived knowledge of BII from social media using NLP

better understand similar emerging illnesses.

inclination i > 60{\deg}) Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) have posed an
important challenge to current models of solar system formation (Levison et al.
2008; Nesvorn\'y 2015). These remarkable minor planets necessitate the presence
of a distant reservoir of strongly-out-of-plane TNOs, which itself requires
some dynamical production mechanism (Gladman et al. 2009; Gomes et al. 2015;
Batygin and Brown 2016). A notable recent addition to the census of high-i
minor bodies in the solar system is the retrograde asteroid 514107
Ka'epaoka'awela, which currently occupies a 1:-1 mean motion resonance with
Jupiter at i = 163{\deg} (Wiegert et al. 2017). In this work, we delineate a
direct connection between retrograde Jupiter Trojans and high-i Centaurs.
First, we back-propagate a large sample of clones of Ka'epaoka'awela for 100 Ma
numerically, and demonstrate that long-term stable clones tend to decrease
their inclination steadily until it concentrates between 90{\deg} and
135{\deg}, while their eccentricity and semi-major axis increase, placing many
of them firmly into the trans-Neptunian domain. Importantly, the clones show
significant overlap with the synthetic high-i Centaurs generated in Planet 9
studies (Batygin et al. 2019), and hint at the existence of a relatively
prominent, steady-state population of minor bodies occupying polar
trans-Saturnian orbits. Second, through direct numerical forward-modeling, we
delineate the dynamical pathway through which conventional members of the
Kuiper Belt's scattered disk population can become retrograde Jovian Trojan
resonators in presence of Planet 9.

  Submitted in a different format and nearly identical content to MDPI Entropy",,"10.3390/e22111324",,"eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In optical communications, four-dimensional (4D) modulation formats encode
information onto the quadrature components of two arbitrary orthogonal states
of polarisation of the optical field. These formats have recently regained
attention due their potential power efficiency, nonlinearity tolerance, and
ultimately to their still unexplored shaping gains. As in the fibre-optic
channel the shaping gain is closely related to the nonlinearity tolerance of a
given modulation format, predicting the effect of nonlinearity is key to
effectively optimise the transmitted constellation. Many analytical models
available in the optical communication literature allow, within a first-order
perturbation framework, the computation of the average power of the nonlinear
interference (NLI) accumulated in coherent fibre-optic transmission systems.
However, all current models only operate under the assumption of a transmitted
polarisation-multiplexed, two-dimensional (PM-2D) modulation format. PM-2D
formats represent a limited subset of the possible dual-polarisation 4D
formats, namely, only those where data transmitted on each polarisation channel
are mutually independent and identically distributed. This document presents a
step-by-step mathematical derivation of the extension of existing NLI models to
the class of arbitrary dual-polarisation 4D modulation formats. In particular,
the methodology adopted follows the one of the popular enhanced Gaussian noise
model, albeit dropping most assumptions on the geometry and statistic of the
transmitted 4D modulation format. The resulting expressions show that, whilst
in the PM-2D case the NLI power depends only on different statistical
high-order moments of each polarisation component, for a general 4D
constellation also several others cross-polarisation correlations need to be
taken into account.

$n$ grows as a sufficiently large polynomial in $L$, and the number of i.i.d.
samples from the manifolds is polynomial in $L$, randomly-initialized gradient

the context of a practically-motivated model problem: the depth acts as a
fitting resource, with larger depths corresponding to smoother networks that
can more readily separate the class manifolds, and the width acts as a
statistical resource, enabling concentration of the randomly-initialized

each sample has a mean and a variance, it propagates the mean and the variance
throughout the network to deliver outputs with second order statistics. In this
framework, both the input and the output could be interpreted as Gaussians. To
do so, we derive differentiable analytic solutions, or reasonable
approximations, to propagate across commonly used NN layers. To train the
network, we define a differentiable loss based on the KL-divergence between the
predicted Gaussian and a Gaussian around the ground truth action borders, and
use standard back-propagation. Importantly, the variances propagation in VANp
does not require any additional parameters, and during testing, does not
require any additional computations either. In action localization, the means
and the variances of the input are computed at pooling operations, that are
typically used to bring arbitrarily long videos to a vector with fixed
dimensions. Second, we propose two alternative formulations that augment the
first (respectively, the last) layer of a regression network with additional
parameters so as to take in the input (respectively, predict in the output)
both means and variances. Results in the action localization problem show that
the incorporation of second order statistics improves over the baseline
network, and that VANp surpasses the accuracy of virtually all other two-stage
networks without involving any additional parameters.

conjecture a close-knit structure between the three quantities that emerges in
states excited above the vacuum, including both local and global quantum
quenches. This structure intimately depends on the chaoticity of the theory
i.e. there exist distinct sets of equivalences for integrable and chaotic
theories. For rational conformal field theories (RCFT), we find all quantities
to compute the quantum dimension of the primary operator inserted. In contrast,
we find the correlation measures to grow (logarithmically) without bound in all
$c > 1$ conformal field theories with a finite twist gap. In comparing the
calculations in the two classes of theories, we are able to identify the
dynamical mechanism for the breakdown of the quasi-particle picture in 2D

our general lessons apply to quantum systems considerably distinct from
conformal field theories, such as integrable and chaotic spin chains,
suggesting a universality of entanglement dynamics in non-equilibrium systems.

theory of covering spaces within a more general framework of lifting spaces
(i.e., Hurewicz fibrations with unique path-lifting property). Among other,
Spanier proved that for every space $X$ there exists a universal lifting space,
which however need not be simply connected, unless the base space $X$ is
semi-locally simply connected. The question on what exactly is the fundamental
group of the universal space was left unanswered.
  The main source of lifting spaces are inverse limits of covering spaces over
$X$, or more generally, over some inverse system of spaces converging to $X$.
Every metric space $X$ can be obtained as a limit of an inverse system of
polyhedra, and so inverse limits of covering spaces over the system yield
lifting spaces over $X$. They are related to the geometry (in particular the
fundamental group) of $X$ in a similar way as the covering spaces over
polyhedra are related to the fundamental group of their base. Thus lifting
spaces appear as a natural replacement for the concept of covering spaces over
base spaces with bad local properties.
  In this paper we develop a general theory of lifting spaces and prove that
they are preserved by products, inverse limits and other important
constructions. We show that maps from $X$ to polyhedra give rise to coverings
over $X$ and use that to prove that for a connected, locally path connected and
paracompact $X$, the fundamental group of the above-mentioned Spanier's
universal space is precisely the intersection of all Spanier groups associated
to open covers of $X$, and that the later coincides with the shape kernel of
$X$. Furthermore, we examine in more detail lifting spaces over $X$ that arise
as inverse limits of coverings over some approximations of $X$.

non-spatial features observed at each pixel, the problem of surface
segmentation aims to classify pixels into contiguous classes based on both
non-spatial features and surface topology. The problem has important
applications in hydrology, planetary science, and biochemistry but is uniquely
challenging for several reasons. First, the spatial extent of class segments
follows surface contours in the topological space, regardless of their spatial
shapes and directions. Second, the topological structure exists in multiple
spatial scales based on different surface resolutions. Existing widely
successful deep learning models for image segmentation are often not applicable
due to their reliance on convolution and pooling operations to learn regular
structural patterns on a grid. In contrast, we propose to represent surface
topological structure by a contour tree skeleton, which is a polytree capturing
the evolution of surface contours at different elevation levels. We further
design a graph neural network based on the contour tree hierarchy to model
surface topological structure at different spatial scales. Experimental
evaluations based on real-world hydrological datasets show that our model
outperforms several baseline methods in classification accuracy.

$\phi$ the coupling in the form $\sim R^2\phi$ is assumed. Several interesting
results follow from our consideration. Maximal possible star mass with given
EoS increases due to the contribution of coupling term. We discovered the
possibility to increase maximal frequency of the rotation in comparison with
General Relativity. As a consequence the lower bound on mass of the fast
rotating stars decreases. For frequency $f=700$ Hz neutron stars with masses
$\sim M_\odot$ can exist for some choice of parameters (in General Relativity
for same EoS this limit is around $1.2 M_{\odot}$). Another feature of our

as the ones studied by medium baseline reactor experiments, or matter effect
modified oscillations such as those manifesting in long-baseline neutrino beams

today, a fully resolved MO measurement ($\geq$5$\sigma$) is most likely to

standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter cosmological model, that has been
constrained with unprecedented accuracy. However, with the increase of the
experimental sensitivity a few statistically significant tensions between
different independent cosmological datasets emerged. While these tensions can
be in portion the result of systematic errors, the persistence after several
years of accurate analysis strongly hints at cracks in the standard
cosmological scenario and the need for new physics. In this Letter of Interest
we will focus on the $4.4\sigma$ tension between the Planck estimate of the
Hubble constant $H_0$ and the SH0ES collaboration measurements. After showing
the $H_0$ evaluations made from different teams using different methods and
geometric calibrations, we will list a few interesting new physics models that
could solve this tension and discuss how the next decade experiments will be
crucial.

importance for cosmology since it could not only confirm the paradigm of

Universe scenarios. The recent observations, while broadly consistent with a
spatially flat standard $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model, are
showing tensions that still allow (and, in some cases, even suggest) a few
percent deviations from a flat universe. In particular, the Planck Cosmic
Microwave Background power spectra, assuming the nominal likelihood, prefer a
closed universe at more than 99\% confidence level. While new physics could be
in action, this anomaly may be the result of an unresolved systematic error or
just a statistical fluctuation. However, since a positive curvature allows a
larger age of the Universe, an accurate determination of the age of the oldest
objects provides a smoking gun in confirming or falsifying the current flat
$\Lambda$CDM model.

our understanding of their initial conditions, better constraints on turbulence
can result in windfalls in Galactic archaeology, star cluster dynamics and star
formation. Observationally, constraining the spectral index of turbulent gas
usually involves computing spectra from velocity maps. Here we suggest that
information on the spectral index might be directly inferred from column
density maps (possibly obtained by dust emission/absorption) through deep
learning. We generate mock density maps from a large set of adaptive mesh
refinement turbulent gas simulations using the hydro-simulation code RAMSES. We
train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on the resulting images to predict
the turbulence index, optimize hyper-parameters in validation and test on a
holdout set. Our adopted CNN model achieves a mean squared error of 0.024 in
its predictions on our holdout set, over underlying spectral indexes ranging
from 3 to 4.5. We also perform robustness tests by applying our model to
altered holdout set images, and to images obtained by running simulations at
different resolutions. This preliminary result on simulated density maps
encourages further developments on real data, where observational biases and
other issues need to be taken into account.

observing an unexpected enhancement of the $e^+-e^-$ pair production signal in

the creation of a protophobic vector boson ($X$) with a mass around 17 MeV

result is that $X$ production is dominated by direct transitions induced by
$E1^X$ and $L1^X$ (transverse and longitudinal electric dipoles) and $C1^X$
(charge dipole) without going through any nuclear resonance (i.e.
Bremsstrahlung radiation) with a smooth energy dependence that occurs for all

of supporting large-scale labeled data. Our work in this paper focuses on two
key aspects of this problem: the lack of domain-specific training or benchmark
datasets, and adapting face embeddings learned on web images to long-form
content, specifically movies. First, we present a dataset of over 169,000 face
tracks curated from 240 Hollywood movies with weak labels on whether a pair of
face tracks belong to the same or a different character. We propose an offline
algorithm based on nearest-neighbor search in the embedding space to mine
hard-examples from these tracks. We then investigate triplet-loss and multiview
correlation-based methods for adapting face embeddings to hard-examples. Our
experimental results highlight the usefulness of weakly labeled data for
domain-specific feature adaptation. Overall, we find that multiview
correlation-based adaptation yields more discriminative and robust face
embeddings. Its performance on downstream face verification and clustering
tasks is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art results in this domain. We
also present the SAIL-Movie Character Benchmark corpus developed to augment
existing benchmarks. It consists of racially diverse actors and provides
face-quality labels for subsequent error analysis. We hope that the large-scale
datasets developed in this work can further advance automatic character
labeling in videos. All resources are available freely at

structural requirements: locality, i.e. available measurements and

feedback, i.e. only differences of measurements are available to the

transfer function, state-space realization, or resulting closed-loop mapping.
We demonstrate that the relative feedback requirement can be written as a
convex constraint on the controller and (in special cases) on the resulting
closed-loop, and we characterize the allowable structures of relative feedback
controllers. We prove that sparse closed-loop design is a convex relaxation of
structured controller state-space design, even in the continuous time IIR
setting. This formalizes and extends results of the recently developed System
Level Synthesis framework. We take a first step toward quantifying the
performance gap associated with this convex relaxation by constructing a class
of examples (based on relative feedback requirements) for which the difference
in performance, measured by an H2 norm, is infinite. The results presented are
used to contrast several issues of structural constraints in distributed
control design that remain as open problems.

combinatorial setting for nearly a century. One application of flip paths to
Euclidean distance geometry and Moebius geometry is a recent, simple,
constructive proof by Connelly and Gortler of the Koebe-Andreev-Thurston circle
packing theorem that relies on the existence of a flip path between any two
triangulation graphs. More generally, length and other structural quantities on
minimum (length) flip paths are metrics on the space of triangulations. In the
geometric setting, finding a minimum flip path between two triangulations is
NP-complete. However, for two lattice triangulations, used to model electron
spin systems, Eppstein and Caputo et al. gave algorithms running in
$O\left(n^2\right)$ time, where $n$ is the number of points in the point-set.
Their algorithms apply to constrained flip paths that ensure a set of
\emph{constraint} edges are present in every triangulation along the path. We
reformulate the problem and provide an algorithm that runs in
$O\left(n^{\frac{3}{2}}\right)$ time. In fact, for a large, natural class of
inputs, the bound is tight, i.e., our algorithm runs in time linear in the
length of this output flip path. Our results rely on structural elucidation of
minimum flip paths. Specifically, for any two lattice triangulations, we use
Farey sequences to construct a partially-ordered sets of flips, called a
minimum flip \emph{plan}, whose linear-orderings are minimum flip paths between
them. To prove this, we characterize a minimum flip plan that starts from an
equilateral lattice triangulation - i.e., a lattice triangulation whose edges
are all unit-length - and \emph{forces a point-pair to become an edge}. To the
best of our knowledge, our results are the first to exploit Farey sequences for
elucidating the structure of flip paths between lattice triangulations.

Matrix-Vector-Multiplications (MVMs) efficiently, are used to realize DNNs on
hardware. However, crossbar non-idealities have always been devalued since they
cause errors in performing MVMs, leading to computational accuracy losses in
DNNs. Several software-based defenses have been proposed to make DNNs
adversarially robust. However, no previous work has demonstrated the advantage
conferred by the crossbar non-idealities in unleashing adversarial robustness.
We show that the intrinsic hardware non-idealities yield adversarial robustness
to the mapped DNNs without any additional optimization. We evaluate the
adversarial resilience of state-of-the-art DNNs (VGG8 & VGG16 networks) using
benchmark datasets (CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 & Tiny Imagenet) across various
crossbar sizes. We find that crossbar non-idealities unleash significantly
greater adversarial robustness (>10-20%) in crossbar-mapped DNNs than baseline
software DNNs. We further assess the performance of our approach with other
state-of-the-art efficiency-driven adversarial defenses and find that our
approach performs significantly well in terms of reducing adversarial loss.

  Posting of this manuscript on the arXiv was coordinated with S. Ghandi et al",,"10.3847/1538-3881/abb46b",,"astro-ph.EP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Observations to characterize planets larger than Earth but smaller than
Neptune have led to largely inconclusive interpretations at low spectral
resolution due to hazes or clouds that obscure molecular features in their
spectra. However, here we show that high-resolution spectroscopy (R $\sim$
25,000 to 100,000) enables one to probe the regions in these atmospheres above
the clouds where the cores of the strongest spectral lines are formed. We
present models of transmission spectra for a suite of GJ1214b-like planets with
thick photochemical hazes covering 1 - 5 $\mu$m at a range of resolutions
relevant to current and future ground-based spectrographs. Furthermore, we
compare the utility of the cross-correlation function that is typically used
with a more formal likelihood-based approach, finding that only the likelihood
based method is sensitive to the presence of haze opacity. We calculate the
signal-to-noise of these spectra, including telluric contamination, required to
robustly detect a host of molecules such as CO, CO$_{2}$, H$_{2}$O, and
CH$_{4}$, and photochemical products like HCN, as a function of wavelength
range and spectral resolution. Spectra in M band require the lowest S/N$_{res}$
to detect multiple molecules simultaneously. CH$_{4}$ is only observable for
the coolest models ($T_{\rm{eff}} =$ 412 K) and only in the L band. We
quantitatively assess how these requirements compare to what is achievable with
current and future instruments, demonstrating that characterization of small
cool worlds with ground-based high resolution spectroscopy is well within
reach.

investigate the potential effect defense techniques have on the geometry of the
likelihood landscape - likelihood of the input images under the trained model.
We first propose a way to visualize the likelihood landscape leveraging an
energy-based model interpretation of discriminative classifiers. Then we
introduce a measure to quantify the flatness of the likelihood landscape. We
observe that a subset of adversarial defense techniques results in a similar
effect of flattening the likelihood landscape. We further explore directly
regularizing towards a flat landscape for adversarial robustness.

to 1836 resulted in the enslavement of an estimated 121,000 people who were
then transported to coastal ports via complex trade networks and loaded onto
slave ships destined for the Americas. Historians have a good record of where
these people went across the Atlantic, but little is known about where
individuals were from or enslaved \textit{within} Africa. In this work, we
develop a novel two-step statistical approach to describe the enslavement of
people given documented violent conflict, the transport of enslaved peoples
from their location of capture to their port of departure, and---given an
enslaved individual's location of departure---that person's probability of
origin. We combine spatial prediction of conflict density via Kriging with a
Markov decision process characterising intra-African transportation. The
results of this model can be visualised using an interactive web application,
plotting estimated conditional probabilities of historical migrations during
the African diaspora. These results help trace the uncertain origins of people
enslaved in this region of Africa during this time period: using the two-step
statistical methodology developed here provides a probabilistic answer to this
question.

$\emph{Coh}^T(X)$ has an explicit combinatorial description as sheaves whose
restriction to each $\mathbb{A}^n$ corresponding to a maximal cone is
determined by an $n$-dimensional generalized skew shape. The (non-additive)
categories $\emph{Coh}^{\alpha}(X), \emph{Coh}^T(X)$ are treated via the
formalism of proto-exact/proto-abelian categories developed by
Dyckerhoff-Kapranov.
  The Hall algebras $H^{\alpha}_X, H^{T}_X$ are graded and connected, and so
enveloping algebras $H^{\alpha}_X \simeq U(\mathfrak{n}^{\alpha}_X)$, $H^{T}_X
\simeq U(\mathfrak{n}^{T}_X)$, where the Lie algebras $\mathfrak{n}^{\alpha}_X,
\mathfrak{n}^{T}_X$ are spanned by the indecomposable coherent sheaves in their
respective categories.
  We explicitly work out several examples, and in some cases are able to relate
$\mathfrak{n}^T_X$ to known Lie algebras. In particular, when $X =
\mathbb{P}^1$, $\mathfrak{n}^T_X$ is isomorphic to a non-standard Borel in
$\mathfrak{gl}_2 [t,t^{-1}]$. When $X$ is the second infinitesimal neighborhood
of the origin inside $\mathbb{A}^2$, $\mathfrak{n}^T_X$ is isomorphic to a
subalgebra of $\mathfrak{gl}_2[t]$. We also consider the case $X=\mathbb{P}^2$,
where we give a basis for $\mathfrak{n}^T_X$ by describing all indecomposable

corrupted language labels. We describe how we uncovered problematic signals

where Twitter switched on or off different kinds of language identification
algorithms, and where data formats may have changed. We then show how we create
a statistic for identifying and removing words with pathological time series.
While our resulting process for removing `bad' time series from ensembles of
time series is particular, the approach leading to its construction may be
generalizeable.

evolving flow---and particularly, its response to disturbances---using
measurements from available sensors. Building from previous work by Darakananda
et al.~(Phys Rev Fluids 2018), we further develop an ensemble Kalman filter
(EnKF) framework for aerodynamic flows based on an ensemble of
randomly-perturbed inviscid vortex models of flow about an infinitely-thin
plate. In the forecast step, vortex elements in each ensemble member are
advected by the flow and new elements are released from each edge of the plate;
the elements are aggregated to maintain an efficient representation. The vortex
elements and leading edge constraint are corrected in the analysis step by
assimilating the surface pressure differences across the plate measured from
the truth system. We show that the overall framework can be physically
interpreted as a series of adjustments to the position and shape of an
elliptical region of uncertainty associated with each vortex element. In this
work, we compare the previously-used stochastic EnKF with the ensemble
transform Kalman filter (ETKF), which uses a deterministic analysis step. We
examine the response of the flat plate at $20^\circ$ in two perturbed flows,
with truth data obtained from high-fidelity simulation at Reynolds number 500.
In the first case, we apply a sequence of large-amplitude pulses near the
leading edge of the plate to mimic flow actuation. In the second, we place the
plate in a vortex street wake behind a cylinder. In both cases, we show that
the vortex-based framework accurately estimates the pressure distribution and
normal force, with no {\em a priori} knowledge of the perturbations. We show
that the ETKF is consistently more robust than the stochastic EnKF. Finally, we
examine the mapping from measurements to state update in the analysis step

  and Measures",,,,,"cs.CR cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Social platforms are heavily used by individuals to share their thoughts and
personal information. However, due to regret over time about posting
inappropriate social content, embarrassment, or even life or relationship
changes, some past posts might also pose serious privacy concerns for them. To
cope with these privacy concerns, social platforms offer deletion mechanisms
that allow users to remove their contents. Quite naturally, these deletion
mechanisms are really useful for removing past posts as and when needed.
However, these same mechanisms also leave the users potentially vulnerable to
attacks by adversaries who specifically seek the users' damaging content and
exploit the act of deletion as a strong signal for identifying such content.
Unfortunately, today user experiences and contextual expectations regarding
such attacks on deletion privacy and deletion privacy in general are not well
understood.
  To that end, in this paper, we conduct a user survey-based exploration
involving 191 participants to unpack their prior deletion experiences, their
expectations of deletion privacy, and how effective they find the current
deletion mechanisms. We find that more than 80% of the users have deleted at
least a social media post, and users self-reported that, on average, around 35%
of their deletions happened after a week of posting. While the participants
identified the irrelevancy (due to time passing) as the main reason for content
removal, most of them believed that deletions indicate that the deleted content
includes some damaging information to the owner. Importantly, the participants
are significantly more concerned about their deletions being noticed by
large-scale data collectors (e.g., the government) than individuals from their

dynamical systems as coins whose classical limit can range from being
integrable to chaotic. It is shown that a Loschmidt echo like fidelity plays a
central role and when the coin is chaotic this is approximately the
characteristic function of a classical random walker. Thus the classical
binomial distribution arises as a limit of the quantum walk and the walker
exhibits diffusive growth before eventually becoming ballistic. The coin-walker
entanglement growth is shown to be logarithmic in time as in the case of
many-body localization and coupled kicked rotors, and saturates to a value that
depends on the relative coin and walker space dimensions. In a coin dominated
scenario, the chaos can thermalize the quantum walk to typical random states
such that the entanglement saturates at the Haar averaged Page value, unlike in
a walker dominated case when atypical states seem to be produced.

Goode Solar Telescope (GST) at the Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO). CYRA
focuses on the study of the near-infrared solar spectrum between 1 and 5
microns, a under explored region which is not only a fertile ground for
photospheric magnetic diagnostics, but also allows a unique window into the
chromosphere lying atop the photosphere. CYRA is the first ever fully cryogenic
spectrograph in any solar observatory with its two predecessors, on the
McMath-Pierce and Mees Telescopes, being based on warm optics except for the
detectors and order sorting filters. CYRA is used to probe magnetic fields in
various solar features and the quiet photosphere. CYRA measurements will allow
new and better 3D extrapolations of the solar magnetic field and will provide
more accurate boundary conditions for solar activity models. Superior spectral
resolution of 150,000 and better allows enhanced observations of the
chromosphere in the carbon monoxide (CO) spectral bands and will yield a better
understanding of energy transport in the solar atmosphere. CYRA is divided into
two optical sub-systems: The Fore-Optics Module and the Spectrograph. The
Spectrograph is the heart of the instrument and contains the IR detector,
grating, slits, filters, and imaging optics all in a cryogenically cooled Dewar
(cryostat). The detector a 2048 by 2048 pixel HAWAII 2 array produced by
Teledyne Scientific & Imaging, LLC. The interior of the cryostat and the
readout electronics are maintained at 90 Kelvin by helium refrigerant based
cryo-coolers, while the IR array is cooled to 30 Kelvin. The Fore-Optics Module

terminated by brightening. This system showed negative superhumps,
semi-periodic variations having periods slightly shorter than the orbital
period, and super-orbital signals, both of which are believed to originate from
a precessing, tilted accretion disk. We have re-examined its Kepler light curve
extending over 1500 d. In accordance with a cycle of the IW And-type light
variation, the frequency of negative superhumps showed a reproducible
variation: a rapid drop during the brightening and a gradual increase during
the standstill. They are interpreted as the drastic change in the radial mass
distribution and the expansion of the tilted disk, which is not expected from
the existing models for IW And stars. The constancy in flux amplitudes of
negative superhumps confirms that their light source is the bright spot
sweeping across the surface of the tilted disk. The frequencies of negative
superhumps and super-orbital signals varied in unison on long timescales,
suggesting their common origin: the tilted disk. Orbital signals at the
brightening were dominated by the irradiation of the secondary star and varied
with the orientation of the tilted disk; the amplitude was maximized at the
minimum of super-orbital signals and the light maximum shifted to early orbital
phases as the super-orbital phase advances. This is the first direct evidence
that the disk was tilted out of the binary orbital plane and retrogradely
precessing. The tilt angle of the disk inferred from semi-amplitudes of
super-orbital signals was lower than 3 degrees. The diversity in light curves
of negative superhumps supports this and suggests that a part of the gas stream
overflows the disk edge. This study thus offers rich information about the
tilted disk in CVs.

the broad Balmer emission lines appear or disappear within a few years. We use
the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey to
identify five CL-AGNs. The 2-D photometric and kinematic maps reveal common
features as well as some unusual properties of CL-AGN hosts as compared to the
AGN hosts in general. All MaNGA CL-AGNs reside in the star-forming main
sequence, similar to MaNGA non-changing-look AGNs (NCL-AGNs). The $80\% \pm
16\%$ of our CL-AGNs do possess pseudo-bulge features, and follow the overall
NCL-AGNs $M_{BH}-\sigma_{*}$ relationship. The kinematic measurements indicate
that they have similar distributions in the plane of angular momentum versus
galaxy ellipticity. MaNGA CL-AGNs however show a higher, but not statistically
significant ($20\% \pm 16\%$) fraction of counter-rotating features compared to
that ($1.84\% \pm 0.61\%$) in general star-formation population. In addition,
MaNGA CL-AGNs favor more face-on (axis ratio $>$ 0.7) than that of Type I
NCL-AGNs. These results suggest that host galaxies could play a role in the
CL-AGN phenomenon.

The objective of this paper is to compare the coverage performance between
centralized and decentralized approaches. To this end, a near-optimal
centralized coverage control method is developed under energy depletion and
repletion constraints. The optimal coverage formation corresponds to the
locations of agents where the coverage performance is maximized. The optimal
charging formation corresponds to the locations of agents with one agent fixed
at the charging station and the remaining agents maximizing the coverage
performance. We control the behavior of this cooperative multi-agent system by
switching between the optimal coverage formation and the optimal charging
formation. Finally, the optimal dwell times at coverage locations, charging
time, and agent trajectories are determined so as to maximize coverage over a
given time interval. In particular, our controller guarantees that at any time
there is at most one agent leaving the team for energy repletion.

about the energy necessary to make nuclear systems more neutron-rich. While its
slope parameter L at the saturation density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter has been
relatively well constrained by recent astrophysical observations and
terrestrial nuclear experiments, its curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$ characterizing
the $E_{sym}(\rho)$ around $2\rho_0$ remains largely unconstrained. Over 520
calculations for $E_{sym}(\rho)$ using various nuclear theories and
interactions in the literature have predicted several significantly different
$K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ correlations. Purpose: If a unique $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$
correlation of $E_{sym}(\rho)$ can be firmly established, it will enable us to
progressively better constrain the high-density behavior of $E_{sym}(\rho)$
using the available constraints on its slope parameter L. We investigate if and
by how much the different $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ correlations may affect neutron star
observables. Method: A meta-model of nuclear Equation of States (EOSs) with
three representative $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ correlation functions is used to generate
multiple EOSs for neutron stars. We then examine effects of the
$K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ correlation on the crust-core transition density and pressure
as well as the radius and tidal deformation of canonical neutron stars.
Results:The $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ correlation affects significantly both the
crust-core transition density and pressure. It also has strong imprints on the
radius and tidal deformability of canonical neutron stars especially at small L
values. The available data from LIGO/VIRGO and NICER set some useful limits for
the slope L but can not distinguish the three representative $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$
correlations considered.

significantly from that of the first observation period (Epoch1). A
significantly brightness-dependent BWB chromatism emerges in the total data of

tractable resolvent. We show that the proposed schemes are equipped with a.s.
convergence guarantees, linear (strongly monotone A) and O(1/k) (monotone A)
rates of convergence while achieving optimal oracle complexity bounds. The rate
statements in monotone regimes appear to be amongst the first and rely on
leveraging the Fitzpatrick gap function for monotone inclusions. Furthermore,
the schemes rely on weaker moment requirements on noise and allow for weakening
unbiasedness requirements on oracles in strongly monotone regimes. Preliminary
numerics on a class of two-stage stochastic variational inequality problems
reflect these findings and show that the variance-reduced schemes outperform
stochastic approximation schemes and sample-average approximation approaches.
The benefits of attaining deterministic rates of convergence become even more

demonstrated the effective bandgap engineering of C3N by cutting it into
hydrogen passivated C3NNRs and stacking them into bilayer heterostructures. It
was found that armchair (AC) C3NNRs with three types of edge structures are all
semiconductors, while only zigzag (ZZ) C3NNRs with edges composed of both C and
N atoms (ZZ-CN/CN) are semiconductors. The bandgaps of all semiconducting
C3NNRs are larger than that of C3N nanosheet. More interestingly, AC-C3NNRs
with CN/CN edges (AC-CN/CN) possess direct bandgap while ZZ-CN/CN have indirect
bandgap. Compared with the monolayer C3NNR, the bandgaps of bilayer C3NNRs can
be greatly modulated via different stacking orders and edge structures, varying
from 0.43 eV for ZZ-CN/CN with AB'-stacking to 0.04 eV for AC-CN/CN with
AA-stacking. Particularly, transition from direct to indirect bandgap was
observed in the bilayer AC-CN/CN heterostructure with AA'-stacking, and the
indirect-to-direct transition was found in the bilayer ZZ-CN/CN with

In this paper, we investigate the deployment of an unmanned aerial vehicle

clustering, channel assignment, and resource allocation sub-problems. We
propose a solution methodology that obtains user clustering and channel
assignment based on the optimal resource allocations for a given UAV location.
To this end, we derive closed-form optimal power and time allocations and show
it delivers optimal max-min fair throughput by consuming less energy and time
than geometric programming. Based on optimal resource allocation, the optimal
coverage probability is also provided in closed-form, which takes channel
estimation errors, hardware impairments, and primary network interference into
account. The optimal coverage probabilities are used by the proposed max-min
fair user clustering and channel assignment approaches. The results show that
the proposed method achieves 100% accuracy in more than five orders of

  In this paper we describe our design of an SPV protocol that leverages

PPG cells from real and fake videos and feed these to a state-of-the-art

mobile devices while maintaining the privacy of users. Current work in FL,
however, makes the unrealistic assumption that the users have ground-truth
labels on their devices, while also assuming that the server has neither data
nor labels. In this work, we consider the more realistic scenario where the
users have only unlabeled data, while the server has some labeled data, and
where the amount of labeled data is smaller than the amount of unlabeled data.
We call this learning problem semi-supervised federated learning (SSFL). For
SSFL, we demonstrate that a critical issue that affects the test accuracy is
the large gradient diversity of the models from different users. Based on this,
we investigate several design choices. First, we find that the so-called
consistency regularization loss (CRL), which is widely used in semi-supervised
learning, performs reasonably well but has large gradient diversity. Second, we
find that Batch Normalization (BN) increases gradient diversity. Replacing BN
with the recently-proposed Group Normalization (GN) can reduce gradient
diversity and improve test accuracy. Third, we show that CRL combined with GN
still has a large gradient diversity when the number of users is large. Based
on these results, we propose a novel grouping-based model averaging method to
replace the FedAvg averaging method. Overall, our grouping-based averaging,
combined with GN and CRL, achieves better test accuracy than not just a
contemporary paper on SSFL in the same settings (>10\%), but also four

In this paper we provide general formulas valid for free scalar fields in

expressions are fully determined in terms of correlators of the fields, making
them amenable to lattice calculations. We apply this to the case of a
$(1+1)$-dimensional chiral scalar, whose reflected entropy we compute for two
intervals as a function of the cross-ratio, comparing it with previous
holographic and free-fermion results. For both types of free theories we find
that reflected entropy satisfies the conjectural monotonicity property $R(A,BC)
\geq R(A,B)$. Then, we move to $(2+1)$ dimensions and evaluate it for square
regions for free scalars, fermions and holography, determining the very-far and
very-close regimes and comparing them with their mutual information
counterparts. In all cases considered, both for $(1+1)$- and

superluminous supernova (SLSN) PTF10hgi, and the most active repeating fast
radio burst FRB121102. This study has its root in the hypothesized FRB-SLSN
connection that states that magnetars born in SLSN can power FRBs. The wideband
spectrum (0.6--15 GHz) of PTF10hgi presented here, provides strong evidence for
the magnetar wind nebular origin of the radio emission. The same spectrum also
enables us to make robust estimates of the radius and the magnetic field of the
radio emitting region and demonstrates that the nebula is powered by the
rotational energy of the magnetar. This spectrum is then compared with that of
FRB121102 which we extend down to 400 MHz using archival data. The newly added
measurements put very tight constraint on the emission models of the compact
persistent source associated with FRB121102. We find that while both sources
can be powered by the rotational energy of the underlying magnetar, the average
energy injection rate is much higher in FRB121102. Hence, we hypothesise that,
if PTF10hgi is indeed emitting fast radio bursts, those will be much weaker
energetically than those from FRB121102.

Adversarial Self Mining (PASM), to improve the recognition accuracy in facial
expression recognition. Unlike previous works focusing on designing specific
architectures or loss functions to solve this problem, PASM boosts the network
capability by simulating human learning processes: providing updated learning
materials and guidance from more capable teachers. Specifically, to generate
new learning materials, PASM leverages a point adversarial attack method and a
trained teacher network to locate the most informative position related to the
target task, generating harder learning samples to refine the network. The
searched position is highly adaptive since it considers both the statistical
information of each sample and the teacher network capability. Other than being
provided new learning materials, the student network also receives guidance
from the teacher network. After the student network finishes training, the
student network changes its role and acts as a teacher, generating new learning
materials and providing stronger guidance to train a better student network.
The adaptive learning materials generation and teacher/student update can be
conducted more than one time, improving the network capability iteratively.
Extensive experimental results validate the efficacy of our method over the
existing state of the arts for facial expression recognition.

is consistent with the HI 21cm absorption redshift, while the strength and
velocity spread of the absorption against J0229+0053 suggest that it too arises
from gas in the AGN environment: both absorbers are thus likely to be

the typical luminosities of AGNs against which HI 21cm searches have hitherto

is well-reproduced by the shock heating of circumstellar matter for the $42

curve shape depends on the various model parameters, such as CSM structure and
composition. We also discuss (1) other possible energy sources and their
constraints, (2) origin of observed high-energy radiation, and (3) how our
result depends on the radiative transfer codes. Based on our successful model

relationships between nanoscaled features and physical properties. Grain
boundary strengthening through grain size reduction offers some interesting
possibilities but is limited by thermal stability issues. Zener pinning by
stable nanoscaled particles or grain boundary segregation are well-known
strategies for stabilizing grain boundaries. In this study, the Al-Ca system
has been selected to investigate the way segregation affects the combination of
mechanical strength and electrical resistivity. For this purpose, an Al-Ca
composite material was severely deformed by high-pressure torsion to achieve a
nanoscaled structure with a mean grain size of only 25 nm. X-ray diffraction,
transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography data revealed that
the fcc Ca phase was dissolved for large levels of plastic deformation leading
mainly to Ca segregations along crystalline defects. The resulting
microhardness of about 300 HV is much higher than predictions based on Hall and
Petch Law and is attributed to limited grain boundary mediated plasticity due
to Ca segregation. The electrical resistivity is also much higher than that
expected for nanostructured Al. The main contribution comes from Ca
segregations that lead to a fraction of electrons reflected or trapped by grain
boundaries twice larger than in pure Al. The two-phase state was investigated
by in-situ and ex-situ microscopy after annealing at 200{\textdegree}C for 30
min, where precipitation of nanoscaled Al4Ca particles occurred and the mean
grain size reached 35 nm. Annealing also significantly decreased electrical
resistivity, but it remained much higher than that of nanostructured pure Al,
due to Al/Al4Ca interfaces that reflect or trap more than 85% of electrons.

We provide a first automatic solution for the integration of such tabular data

data should be analyzed and the challenge of automatic multidimensional schema
generation should be addressed. Hence, we propose a typology of tabular data
and discuss our idea of an automatic solution.

anomalies especially in the early 20th century warming (ETCW) period, using
principal component analysis (PCA) and reverse arrangement trend analysis. ETCW
is significant in all other continents except for Oceania. Warming in South
America is significant from the ETCW onwards, but significant recent warming
started in North America and Europe only around 1990.
  The zonal and seasonal PC2s are both correlated with AMO index, but zonal PC3
is related to Southern oscillation index (SOI) and seasonal PC3 best correlated
with wintertime El Nino (NINO34 DJF index). In the southern hemisphere, the
recent warming starts first closest to the equator in the 1950s and latest in
the southernmost zone in the late 1970s. In the two lowest northern zones
(EQ-N24, N24-N44) the warming is significant since the ETCW, and increased
warming starts in 1970s, but in two northernmost zones (N44-N64, N64-N90) the
cooling after the ETCW delays the start of recent warming until around 1990.
All seasons of the northern hemisphere but no season in the southern hemisphere
depict a significant ETCW.
  All the three PCA have almost common PC1 component for the analyzes
1910-2017, i.e., gradual increase of temperature until 1940s, period of
declining towards the end of 1950s, a flat phase until the second half of 1970s
and steep rise after that. However, the continental PC1 explains only 75.2 % of
the variation of the data, while zonal and seasonal PC1s explain 81.7 % and
87.6 % of the corresponding data, respectively.

accurate detection of Kikuchi bands arising from primary electron beam
excitation energies of 4 keV to 28 keV, with the optimal contrast occurring in

substantially improved via a sparse sampling mode, resulting from the
acquisition of a reduced number of pixels on the detector. Standard inpainting
algorithms are implemented to effectively estimate the information in the
skipped regions in the acquired diffraction pattern. For EBSD mapping, a speed
as high as 5988 scan points per second is demonstrated, with a tolerable
fraction of indexed points and accuracy. The collective capabilities spanning
from high angular resolution EBSD pattern to high speed pattern acquisition are
achieved on the same detector, facilitating simultaneous detection modalities
that enable a multitude of advanced EBSD applications, including lattice strain
mapping, structural refinement, low-dose characterization, 3D-EBSD and dynamic

While the device physics of SHJ solar cells have been studied extensively in

device properties macroscopically have yet to be fully understood. We report
the study of atomic scale current percolation at state-of-the-art a-Si:H/c-Si
heterojunction solar cells under ambient operating conditions, revealing the
profound complexity of electronic SHJ interface processes. Using conduction
atomic force microscopy (cAFM), it is shown that the macroscopic
current-voltage characteristics of SHJ solar cells is governed by the average
of local nanometer-sized percolation pathways associated with bandtail states
of the doped a-Si:H selective contact leading to above bandgap open circuit
voltages ($V_{\mbox{OC}}$) as high as 1.2 V ($V_{\mbox{OC}}>e
E_{\mbox{gap}}^{\mbox{Si}}$). This is not in violation of photovoltaic device
physics but a consequence of the nature of nanometer-scale charge percolation
pathways which originate from trap-assisted tunneling causing dark leakage
current. We show that the broad distribution of local photovoltage is a direct
consequence of randomly trapped charges at a-Si:H dangling bond defects which
lead to strong local potential fluctuations and induce random telegraph noise
of the dark current.

derive the alternating direction method of multipliers based algorithms for the
related problems constrained with the low TT- and low ML rank. Rank constraints
are implemented through the Schatten-p (Sp) norm, p e {0, 1/2, 2/3, 1}, of
unfolded matrices. We provide the proofs of global convergence towards a
stationary point for both algorithms. Rank adjusted 3D OCT image tensors are
finally approximated through tensor train- and Tucker alternating least squares
decompositions. We comparatively validate the low TT- and low ML rank methods
on twenty-two 3D OCT images with the JPEG2000 and 3D SPIHT compression methods,
as well as with no compression 2D bilateral filtering (BF), 2D median filtering
(MF), and enhanced low-rank plus sparse matrix decomposition (ELRpSD) methods.
For the CR<10, the low Sp TT rank method with pe{0, 1/2, 2/3} yields either
highest or comparable signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and comparable or better
contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), mean segmentation errors (SEs) of retina layers
and expert-based image quality score (EIQS) than original image and image
compression methods. It compares favorably in terms of CNR, fairly in terms of
SE and EIQS with the no image compression methods. Thus, for CR<10 the low S2/3
TT rank approximation can be considered a good choice for visual inspection
based diagnostics. For 2<CR<60, the low S1 ML rank method compares favorably in
terms of SE with image compression methods and with 2D BF and ELRpSD. It is
slightly inferior to 2D MF. Thus, for 2<CR<60, the low S1 ML rank approximation
can be considered a good choice for segmentation based diagnostics either
on-site or in the remote mode of operation.

node representation learning. One key factor of GNN's success is the
\emph{smoothness} property on node representations. Despite this, most GNN
models are fragile to the perturbations on graph inputs and could learn
unreliable node representations. In this paper, we study how to learn node
representations against perturbations in GNN. Specifically, we consider that a
node representation should remain stable under slight perturbations on the
input, and node representations from different structures should be
identifiable, which two are termed as the \emph{stability} and
\emph{identifiability} on node representations, respectively. To this end, we
propose a novel model called Stability-Identifiability GNN Against
Perturbations (SIGNNAP) that learns reliable node representations in an
unsupervised manner. SIGNNAP formalizes the \emph{stability} and
\emph{identifiability} by a contrastive objective and preserves the
\emph{smoothness} with existing GNN backbones. The proposed method is a generic
framework that can be equipped with many other backbone models (e.g. GCN,
GraphSage and GAT). Extensive experiments on six benchmarks under both
transductive and inductive learning setups of node classification demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method. Codes and data are available

self-consistently using the NEQ-EI polarization and found to vanish in the
long-wavelength limit. This property makes the exciton superfluid stable up to
relatively high densities. Numerical results for the MoS$_{2}$ monolayers

theoretical modeling of the rate and distortion. As such, the trellis departure
point can be adaptively adjusted, and unnecessarily visited branches are
accordingly pruned, leading to the shrink of total trellis stages and
simplification of transition branches. Extensive experimental results on the
VVC test model show that the proposed scheme is effective in reducing the
encoding complexity by 11% and 5% with all intra and random access
configurations, respectively, at the cost of only 0.11% and 0.05% BD-Rate

achieved under all intra and random access configurations. Due to the excellent
performance, the VVC test model has adopted one implementation of the proposed

correct, every variant that can be generated must satisfy some constraints. To
ensure that all such variants will be correct (e.g. well-typed) there are only
two ways: either to check the variants of interest individually or to come up
with a complex product-line analysis algorithm, specific to every constraint.
In this paper, we address a generalization of this problem: we propose a
mechanism that allows to check whether a constraint holds simultaneously for
all variants which might be generated. The contribution of this paper is a
function that assumes constraints that shall be fulfilled by all variants and
generates (""lifts"") out of them constraints for the product-line. These lifted
constraints can then be checked directly on a model product-line, thus
simultaneously be verified for all variants. The lifting is formulated in a
very general manner, which allows to make use of generic algorithms like SMT
solving or theorem proving in a modular way. We show how to verify lifted
constraints using SMT solving by automatically translating model product-lines
and constraints. The scalability of the approach is demonstrated with an
industrial case study, in which we apply our lifting to a domain specific
modeling language of the manufacturing domain.

In previous researches, many image enhancement methods have been proposed, but
few methods can deal with these problems simultaneously. In this paper, to
solve these problems simultaneously, we propose a low light image enhancement
method that can combined with supervised learning and previous HSV (Hue,
Saturation, Value) or Retinex model based image enhancement methods. First, we
analyse the relationship between the HSV color space and the Retinex theory,
and show that the V channel (V channel in HSV color space, equals the maximum
channel in RGB color space) of the enhanced image can well represent the
contrast and brightness enhancement process. Then, a data-driven conditional
re-enhancement network (denoted as CRENet) is proposed. The network takes low
light images as input and the enhanced V channel as condition, then it can
re-enhance the contrast and brightness of the low light image and at the same
time reduce noise and color distortion. It should be noted that during the
training process, any paired images with different exposure time can be used
for training, and there is no need to carefully select the supervised images
which will save a lot. In addition, it takes less than 20 ms to process a color
image with the resolution 400*600 on a 2080Ti GPU. Finally, some comparative
experiments are implemented to prove the effectiveness of the method. The
results show that the method proposed in this paper can significantly improve
the quality of the enhanced image, and by combining with other image contrast
enhancement methods, the final enhancement result can even be better than the
reference image in contrast and brightness. (Code will be available at

Compton scattering (DVCS), the coherent and incoherent ones, have been
separated by the CLAS collaboration at JLab, using a $^4$He target. The
incoherent channel, which can provide a tomographic view of the bound proton
and shed light on its elusive parton structure, is thoroughly analyzed here in
Impulse Approximation (IA). A convolution formula for the cross sections in
terms of those for the bound proton is derived. Novel scattering amplitudes for
a bound moving nucleon have been obtained and used. A state-of-the-art nuclear
spectral function, based on the AV18 potential, exact in the two-body part,
with the recoiling system in its ground state, and modelled in the remaining
contribution, with the recoiling system in an excited state, has been used.
Different parametrizations of the generalized parton distributions of the
struck proton have been tested. A good overall agreement with the data for the
beam spin asymmetry (BSA) is obtained. It is found that the predicted
conventional nuclear effects are relevant in DVCS and in the competing
Bethe-Heitler mechanism, but they cancel each other to a large extent in their
ratio, to which the measured asymmetry is proportional. Besides, the calculated
ratio of the BSA of the bound proton to that of the free one does not describe
that estimated by the experimental collaboration. This points to possible
interesting effects beyond the IA analysis presented here. It is therefore
clearly demonstrated that the comparison of the results of a conventional
realistic approach, as the one presented here, with future precise data, has

diffraction data using new ultra-high-pressure techniques to measure the
magnetic structure of Mott-insulating 2D honeycomb antiferromagnet FePS$_3$ at
pressures up to 183 kbar and temperatures down to 80 K. These data are
complemented by high-pressure magnetometry and reverse Monte Carlo modeling of
the spin configurations. As pressure is applied, the previously-measured
ambient-pressure magnetic order switches from an antiferromagnetic to a
ferromagnetic interplanar interaction, and from 2D-like to 3D-like character.
The overall antiferromagnetic structure within the $ab$ planes, ferromagnetic
chains antiferromagnetically coupled, is preserved, but the magnetic
propagation vector is altered from $(0\:1\:\frac{1}{2})$ to $(0\:1\:0)$, a
halving of the magnetic unit cell size. At higher pressures, coincident with
the second structural transition and the insulator-metal transition in this
compound, we observe a suppression of this long-range-order and emergence of a
form of magnetic short-range order which survives above room temperature.
Reverse Monte Carlo fitting suggests this phase to be a short-ranged version of
the original ambient pressure structure - with a return to antiferromagnetic
interplanar correlations. The persistence of magnetism well into the HP-II
metallic state is an observation in seeming contradiction with previous x-ray
spectroscopy results which suggest a spin-crossover transition.

First, features from different dimensions are parallelly extracted and fused
together in our multi-dimension fusion architecture. These features are then
used to generate dynamic filters, which extract subpixel information from
micro-lens images and also implicitly consider the disparity information.
Finally, more high-frequency details learned in the residual branch are added

Experimental results show that the proposed method uses fewer parameters but
achieves better performances than other state-of-the-art methods in various

scenes through identifying semantic objects and capturing their relations, this
paper presents a novel semantic graph based approach for place recognition.
First, we propose a novel semantic graph representation for the point cloud
scenes by reserving the semantic and topological information of the raw point
cloud. Thus, place recognition is modeled as a graph matching problem. Then we
design a fast and effective graph similarity network to compute the similarity.

magnetospheres. If the magnetic axis is misaligned with the star rotation axis,
the current sheet is an oscillatory structure filling an equatorial wedge
determined by the inclination angle, known as the striped wind. Relativistic
reconnection could lead to significant dissipation of magnetic energy and
particle acceleration although the efficiency of this process is debated in
this context. In this study, we aim at reconciling global models of pulsar wind
dynamics and reconnection in the stripes within the same numerical framework,
in order to shed new light on dissipation and particle acceleration in pulsar
winds. To this end, we perform large three-dimensional particle-in-cell
simulations of a split-monopole magnetosphere, from the stellar surface up to
fifty light-cylinder radii away from the pulsar. Plasmoid-dominated
reconnection efficiently fragments the current sheet into a dynamical network
of interacting flux ropes separated by secondary current sheets which consume
the field efficiently at all radii, even past the fast magnetosonic point. Our
results suggest there is a universal dissipation radius solely determined by
the reconnection rate in the sheet, lying well upstream the termination shock
radius in isolated pair producing pulsars. The wind bulk Lorentz factor is much
less relativistic than previously thought. In the comoving frame, the wind is
composed of hot pairs trapped within flux ropes with a hard broad power-law
spectrum, whose maximum energy is limited by the magnetization of the wind at
launch. We conclude that the striped wind is most likely fully dissipated when
it enters the pulsar wind nebula. The predicted wind particle spectrum after
dissipation is reminiscent of the Crab Nebula radio-emitting electrons.

edge states that can drastically reduce dissipation and are useful for the
next-generation electronics. However, the nonvolatile control of topological
edge state is still a challenge. In this paper, based on first-principles
calculations, the switchable topological states are found in the van der Waals
(vdW) heterostructures consisting of two dimensional (2D) Bi(111) bilayer (BL)
and {\alpha}-In2Se3 by reversing the electric polarization of the ferroelectric
{\alpha}-In2Se3. The topological switching results from the different charge
transfer associated with the two opposite polarization states of
{\alpha}-In2Se3. This new topological switching mechanism has the unique
advantages of being fully electrical as well as nonvolatile. Our finding
provides an unprecedented approach to realize ferroelectric control of
topological states in 2D materials, which will have great potential for
applications in topological nanoscale electronics.

is a challenging problem due to the inherent depth and scale ambiguity from a
single view. Addressing this ambiguity requires to aggregate various cues over
the entire image, such as body sizes, scene layouts, and inter-person
relationships. However, most previous methods adopt a top-down scheme that
first performs 2D pose detection and then regresses the 3D pose and scale for
each detected person individually, ignoring global contextual cues. In this
paper, we propose a novel system that first regresses a set of 2.5D
representations of body parts and then reconstructs the 3D absolute poses based
on these 2.5D representations with a depth-aware part association algorithm.
Such a single-shot bottom-up scheme allows the system to better learn and
reason about the inter-person depth relationship, improving both 3D and 2D pose
estimation. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves the
state-of-the-art performance on the CMU Panoptic and MuPoTS-3D datasets and is

  Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"q-bio.NC cs.CV cs.LG cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The human brain uses selective attention to filter perceptual input so that
only the components that are useful for behaviour are processed using its
limited computational resources. We focus on one particular form of visual
attention known as feature-based attention, which is concerned with identifying
features of the visual input that are important for the current task regardless
of their spatial location. Visual feature-based attention has been proposed to
improve the efficiency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) by reducing the
dimensionality of state representations and guiding learning towards relevant
features. Despite achieving human level performance in complex perceptual-motor
tasks, Deep RL algorithms have been consistently criticised for their poor
efficiency and lack of flexibility. Visual feature-based attention therefore
represents one option for addressing these criticisms. Nevertheless, it is
still an open question how the brain is able to learn which features to attend
to during RL. To help answer this question we propose a novel algorithm, termed
Selective Particle Attention (SPA), which imbues a Deep RL agent with the
ability to perform selective feature-based attention. SPA learns which
combinations of features to attend to based on their bottom-up saliency and how
accurately they predict future reward. We evaluate SPA on a multiple choice
task and a 2D video game that both involve raw pixel input and dynamic changes
to the task structure. We show various benefits of SPA over approaches that
naively attend to either all or random subsets of features. Our results
demonstrate (1) how visual feature-based attention in Deep RL models can
improve their learning efficiency and ability to deal with sudden changes in
task structure and (2) that particle filters may represent a viable
computational account of how visual feature-based attention occurs in the
brain.

caused by active magnetic regions transiting visible stellar disk as the star

thousands of young and active stars. However, there is still a lack of
information about rotation periods of older and less active stars, like the
Sun. The irregular temporal profiles of light curves caused by the decay times
of active regions, which are comparable to or even shorter than stellar
rotation periods, combine with the random emergence of active regions to make
period determination for such stars very difficult. We tested the performance
of the new method for the determination of stellar rotation periods against
stars with previously determined rotation periods. The method is based on
calculating the gradient of the power spectrum (GPS) and identifying the
position of the inflection point (i.e. point with the highest gradient). The
GPS method is specifically aimed at determining rotation periods of low
activity stars like the Sun. We applied the GPS method to 1047 Sun-like stars
observed by the Kepler telescope. We show that the GPS method returns precise
values of stellar rotation periods. Furthermore, it allows us to constrain the
ratio between facular and spot areas of active regions at the moment of their
emergence. We show that relative facular area decreases with stellar rotation
rate. Our results suggest that the GPS method can be successfully applied to
retrieve periods of stars with both regular and non-regular light curves.

upper mantle. The parameterization is based on the Hill (1948) orthotropic

validated by comparison with results of the analytical solution and of the
SO-VPSC model for simple shear and axial compression of a homogeneous

texture-induced viscous anisotropy on the reactivation of mantle shear zones in
continental plates highlights unexpected couplings between localized
deformation controlled by variations in the orientation and intensity of the
olivine texture in the mantle and the mechanical behavior of the

mechanism that blends action, object, and action outcome representations into a
latent space, where local regions are formed to host forward model learning.
The agent uses intrinsic motivation to select the forward model with the
highest learning progress to adopt at a given exploration step. This parallels
how infants learn, as high learning progress indicates that the learning
problem is neither too easy nor too difficult in the selected region. The
proposed approach is validated with a simulated robot in a table-top
environment. The simulation scene comprises a robot and various objects, where
the robot interacts with one of them each time using a set of parameterized
actions and learns the outcomes of these interactions. With the proposed
approach, the robot organizes its curriculum of learning as in existing
intrinsic motivation approaches and outperforms them in learning speed.
Moreover, the learning regime demonstrates features that partially match infant
development; in particular, the proposed system learns to predict the outcomes
of different skills in a staged manner.

can bring meaningful impacts in both economic and ecological aspects. However,
the enormous spatial scale and the variety of geological features across
regions has made it a grand challenge with limited solutions based on manual
human monitoring efforts. Although deep learning based algorithms have
demonstrated potential in forming an automated approach in recent years, the
labelling efforts needed for covering different features in different regions
largely constrain its effectiveness in large-scale problems. In this paper, we
propose a novel domain adaptive oil palm tree detection method, i.e., a
Multi-level Attention Domain Adaptation Network (MADAN) to reap cross-regional
oil palm tree counting and detection. MADAN consists of 4 procedures: First, we
adopted a batch-instance normalization network (BIN) based feature extractor
for improving the generalization ability of the model, integrating batch
normalization and instance normalization. Second, we embedded a multi-level
attention mechanism (MLA) into our architecture for enhancing the
transferability, including a feature level attention and an entropy level
attention. Then we designed a minimum entropy regularization (MER) to increase
the confidence of the classifier predictions through assigning the entropy
level attention value to the entropy penalty. Finally, we employed a sliding
window-based prediction and an IOU based post-processing approach to attain the
final detection results. We conducted comprehensive ablation experiments using
three different satellite images of large-scale oil palm plantation area with
six transfer tasks. MADAN improves the detection accuracy by 14.98% in terms of
average F1-score compared with the Baseline method (without DA), and performs
3.55%-14.49% better than existing domain adaptation methods.

our wavelet analysis Cross Wavelet Transform (XWT) and Wavelet Transform
Coherence (WTC) methods were performed. Causal relationships between datasets
were further examined by Convergence Cross Mapping (CCM) method. In results of
our analysis we found followings; 1) The C class X-Ray flare numbers increased
about 16 % during the solar cycle 24 compared to cycle 23, while all other data
sets decreased; the MCMESI decreased about 16 % and the number of M and X class
flares decreased about 32 %. 2) All the X-Ray solar flare classes show
remarkable positive correlation with the MCMESI. While the correlation between
the MCMESI and C class flares comes from the general solar cycle trend, it
mainly results from the fluctuations in the data in case of the X class flares.
3) In general, all class flare numbers and the MCMESI show similar periodic
behavior. 4) The 546 days periodicity detected in the MCMESI may not be of
solar origin or at least the solar flares are not the source of this
periodicity. 5) C and M Class solar flares have a stronger causative effect on
the MCMESI compared to X class solar flares. However the only bidirectional
causal relationship is obtained between the MCMESI and C class flare numbers.

between transmission, storage and sectoral integration as balancing options,
building a bridge between energy system models and detailed power flow studies
becomes increasingly important, but is computationally challenging.
  W compare approximations for two nonlinear phenomena, power flow and
transmission losses, in linear capacity expansion problems that co-optimise
investments in generation, storage and transmission infrastructure. We evaluate
different flow representations discussing differences in investment decisions,
nodal prices, the deviation of optimised flows and losses from simulated AC
power flows, and the computational performance. By using the open European
power system model PyPSA-Eur we obtain detailed and reproducible results aiming
at facilitating the selection of a suitable power flow model.
  Given the differences in complexity, the optimal choice depends on the
application, the user's available computational resources, and the level of
spatial detail considered. Although the commonly used transport model can
already identify key features of a cost-efficient system while being
computationally performant, deficiencies under high loading conditions arise
due to the lack of a physical grid representation. Moreover, disregarding
transmission losses overestimates optimal grid expansion by 20%. Adding a
convex relaxation of quadratic losses with two or three tangents to the
linearised power flow equations and accounting for changing line impedances as
the network is reinforced suffices to represent power flows and losses
adequately in design studies. We show that the obtained investment and dispatch
decisions are then sufficiently physical to be used in more detailed nonlinear
simulations of AC power flow in order to better assess their technical
feasibility.

classically solve on coarse levels while the neural network corrects
interpolated solutions on fine ones, thus avoiding the increasingly expensive
computations that would have to be performed there. This results in a reduction
in computation time through DNN-MG's highly compact neural network. The

allows one to use DNN-MG trained on one mesh domain also on different ones. We
demonstrate the efficacy of DNN-MG for variations of the 2D laminar flow around
an obstacle. For these, our method significantly improves the solutions as well

of AGB envelopes on spectral energy distributions (SEDs), mass estimates, and
subsequent mass-loss rate (MLR) estimates. We also estimate the error made on

3D Monte-Carlo-based radiative-transfer code RADMC-3D to simulate emission from
dusty envelopes with different geometries (but fixed spatial extension). We
compare these predictions with each other, and with the SED of the AGB star EP
Aqr that we use as a benchmark since its envelope is disc-like and known to
harbour spiral arms, as seen in CO. The SEDs involving the most massive
envelopes are those for which the different geometries have the largest impact,
primarily on the silicate features at 10 and 18 um. These different shapes
originate from large differences in optical depths. Massive spirals and discs
appear akin to black bodies. Optically thick edge-on spirals and discs (with
dust masses of 1e-4 and 1e-5 Msun) exhibit black-body SEDs that appear cooler
than those from face-on structures and spheres of the same mass, while
optically thick face-on distributions appear as warmer emission. We find that
our more realistic models, combined spherical and spiral distributions, are 0.1
to 0.5 times less massive than spheres with similar SEDs. More extreme, less
realistic scenarios give that spirals and discs are 0.01 to 0.05 times less
massive than corresponding spheres. This means that adopting the wrong geometry
for an AGB circumstellar envelope may result in a MLR that is incorrect by as
much as 1 to 2 orders of magnitude when derived from SED fitting.

inversion of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ through changes in the $^{209}$Bi nuclear quadrupole
interaction, and the corresponding tensor of the local electric field gradient
was found to follow, surprisingly, the direction of the external magnetic field
if the sample is rotated. This manifests a hidden property of the charge
carriers in the bulk of this topological insulator, which is explored here with
another material, Bi$_2$Te$_3$. It is found that two electric field gradients
appear to be present at $^{209}$Bi, one rests with the lattice, as usual, while
a second follows the external field if it is rotated with respect to the
crystal axes. These electronic degrees of freedom correspond to an effective
rotation of $j$-electrons, and their level life time is believed to be
responsible for a new quadrupolar relaxation that should lead to other special
properties including the electronic specific heat.

  In this paper we consider the interesting special case of multiparameter

multiparameter clustering. In particular, we consider the multiparameter
persistence modules of the zero-dimensional homology of filtered topological
spaces when they are finitely generated. Under certain assumptions, we
characterize such modules and study their decompositions. In particular we
identify a natural class of representations that decompose and can be extended

restrictions, there are still infinitely many classes of indecomposables in
this set.

the orientation of the binary on the sky, which is not currently possible. We
suggest a method to determine the elusive binary orientation and hence predict
the GW polarisation, using km-scale optical intensity interferometry. The most
promising candidate is CD-30$^{\circ}$ 11223, consisting of a hot helium

binary orientation. The resolution needed is far beyond any current instrument,
but not beyond current technology. We consider scenarios where an array of
telescopes with km-scale baselines and/or the Very Large Telescope (VLT) and
Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) are equipped with recently-developed kilo-pixel

runs of numerical weather prediction models with different initial conditions

underdispersive and also biased, so some kind of post-processing is needed to
account for these deficiencies. One of the most popular state of the art
statistical post-processing techniques is the ensemble model output statistics
(EMOS), which provides a full predictive distribution of the studied weather
quantity. We propose a novel EMOS model for calibrating wind speed ensemble
forecasts, where the predictive distribution is a generalized extreme value
(GEV) distribution left truncated at zero (TGEV). The truncation corrects the
disadvantage of the GEV distribution based EMOS models of occasionally
predicting negative wind speed values, without affecting its favorable
properties. The new model is tested on four data sets of wind speed ensemble
forecasts provided by three different ensemble prediction systems, covering
various geographical domains and time periods. The forecast skill of the TGEV
EMOS model is compared with the predictive performance of the truncated normal,
log-normal and GEV methods and the raw and climatological forecasts as well.
The results verify the advantageous properties of the novel TGEV EMOS approach.

collisions (HICs), and can affect obviously many observables at the final
state, such as the multifragmentation and the collective flow. Usually, it
cannot be measured directly in experiments but might be inferred from
observables at the final state. Artificial intelligence has had great success
in learning complex representations of data, which enables novel modeling and
data processing approaches in physical sciences. In this article, we employ two
of commonly used algorithms in the field of artificial intelligence, the
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine
(LightGBM), to improve the accuracy of determining impact parameter by
analyzing the proton spectra in transverse momentum and rapidity on the
event-by-event basis. Au+Au collisions with the impact parameter of
0$\leq$$b$$\leq$10 fm at intermediate energies ($E_{\rm lab}$=$0.2$-$1.0$

dynamics (UrQMD) model to generate the proton spectra data. It is found that
the average difference between the true impact parameter and the estimated one
can be smaller than 0.1 fm. The LightGBM algorithm shows an improved
performance with respect to the CNN on the task in this work. By using the
LightGBM's visualization algorithm, one can obtain the important feature map of
the distribution of transverse momentum and rapidity, which may be helpful in
inferring the impact parameter or centrality in heavy-ion experiments.

results. First, we prove that, under the same assumptions, \cite[Theorem
1.2]{Zhu} is true when $1\leq p< \infty$. Also, we show that \cite[Theorem

\cite[Theorem 1.3]{Zhu} still holds true when the assumption $f$ being a
harmonic quasiregular mapping is replaced by the weaker one $f$ being a
harmonic elliptic mapping.

invariant mechanics poses the challenge of understanding the physical
consequences of a ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded symmetry. In this
paper it is shown that non-trivial physics can be detected in the multiparticle
sector of a theory, being induced by the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times{\mathbb
Z}_2$-graded parastatistics obeyed by the particles. The toy model of the
${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric/ ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded
oscillator is used. In this set-up the one-particle energy levels and their
degenerations are the same for both supersymmetric and ${\mathbb
Z}_2\times{\mathbb Z}_2$-graded versions. Nevertheless, in the multiparticle
sector, a measurement of an observable operator on suitable states can
discriminate whether the system under consideration is composed by ordinary
bosons/fermions or by ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded particles.
Therefore, ${\mathbb Z}_2\times {\mathbb Z}_2$-graded mechanics has
experimentally testable consequences. Furthermore, the ${\mathbb Z}_2\times
{\mathbb Z}_2$-grading constrains the observables to obey a superselection
rule. As a technical tool, the multiparticle sector is encoded in the coproduct
of a Hopf algebra defined on a Universal Enveloping Algebra of a graded Lie
superalgebra with a braided tensor product.

(post-AGB) and post-red giant branch (post-RGB) binaries are not understood. We
suspect that the missing ingredients to explain them probably lie in the
continuous interaction of the central binary with its circumstellar
environment. Aims: We aim at studying the circumbinary material in these
complex systems by investigating the connection between the innermost and
large-scale structures. Methods: We perform high-angular resolution
observations in the near-infrared continuum of HD101584, which has a complex
structure as seen at millimeter wavelengths with a disk-like morphology and a
bipolar outflow due to an episode of strong binary interaction. To account for
the complexity of the target we first perform an image reconstruction and use
this result to fit a geometrical model to extract the morphological and thermal
features of the environment. Results: The image reveals an unexpected
double-ring structure. We interpret the inner ring to be produced by emission
from dust located in the plane of the disk and the outer ring to be produced by
emission from dust that is located 1.6[D/1kpc] au above the disk plane. The
inner ring diameter (3.94[D/1kpc] au), and temperature (T=1540$\pm$10K) are
compatible with the dust sublimation front of the disk. The origin of the
out-of-plane ring (with a diameter of 7.39[D/1kpc] au and a temperature of
1014$\pm10$K) could be due to episodic ejection or a dust condensation front in
the outflow. Conclusion: The observed outer ring is possibly linked with the
blue-shifted side of the large scale outflow seen by ALMA and is tracing its
launching location to the central star. Such observations give morphological
constraints on the ejection mechanism. Additional observations are needed to
constrain the origin of the out-of-plane structure.

learns a shared model across decentralized clients. It can alleviate privacy
concerns of personal re-identification, an important computer vision task. In
this work, we implement federated learning to person re-identification
(FedReID) and optimize its performance affected by statistical heterogeneity in
the real-world scenario. We first construct a new benchmark to investigate the
performance of FedReID. This benchmark consists of (1) nine datasets with
different volumes sourced from different domains to simulate the heterogeneous
situation in reality, (2) two federated scenarios, and (3) an enhanced
federated algorithm for FedReID. The benchmark analysis shows that the
client-edge-cloud architecture, represented by the federated-by-dataset
scenario, has better performance than client-server architecture in FedReID. It
also reveals the bottlenecks of FedReID under the real-world scenario,
including poor performance of large datasets caused by unbalanced weights in
model aggregation and challenges in convergence. Then we propose two
optimization methods: (1) To address the unbalanced weight problem, we propose
a new method to dynamically change the weights according to the scale of model
changes in clients in each training round; (2) To facilitate convergence, we
adopt knowledge distillation to refine the server model with knowledge
generated from client models on a public dataset. Experiment results
demonstrate that our strategies can achieve much better convergence with
superior performance on all datasets. We believe that our work will inspire the
community to further explore the implementation of federated learning on more

identical interest stochastic dynamic game) problems with large or countably
infinite number of decision makers, and characterize existence and structural
properties for (globally) optimal policies. We consider both static and dynamic
non-convex team problems where the cost function and dynamics satisfy an
exchangeability condition. To arrive at existence and structural results on
optimal policies, we first introduce a topology on control policies, which
involves various relaxations given the decentralized information structure.
This is then utilized to arrive at a de Finetti type representation theorem for
exchangeable policies. This leads to a representation theorem for policies
which admit an infinite exchangeability condition. For a general setup of
stochastic team problems with $N$ decision makers, under exchangeability of
observations of decision makers and the cost function, we show that without
loss of global optimality, the search for optimal policies can be restricted to
those that are $N$-exchangeable. Then, by extending $N$-exchangeable policies
to infinitely-exchangeable ones, establishing a convergence argument for the
induced costs, and using the presented de Finetti type theorem, we establish
the existence of an optimal decentralized policy for static and dynamic teams
with countably infinite number of decision makers, which turns out to be
symmetric (i.e., identical) and randomized. In particular, unlike prior work,
convexity of the cost in policies is not assumed. Finally, we show near
optimality of symmetric independently randomized policies for finite
$N$-decision maker team problems and thus establish approximation results for
$N$-decision maker weakly coupled stochastic teams.

supports a very rich family of complex solitary patterns. Some of these
patterns are also found in the quasi-continuum rendition, but the more
intriguing ones, like interlaced pairs of solitary waves, or waves which may
reverse their direction either spontaneously or due a collision, are an
intrinsic feature of the discrete realm.

the applicability of these models to real-world clinical practice. Considering
that datasets are an essential part of model building and evaluation, a deeper
understanding of the current landscape is needed. This paper presents an
overview of the currently public available COVID-19 chest X-ray datasets. Each
dataset is briefly described and potential strength, limitations and
interactions between datasets are identified. In particular, some key
properties of current datasets that could be potential sources of bias,
impairing models trained on them are pointed out. These descriptions are useful
for model building on those datasets, to choose the best dataset according the

dexterous hands. Improving the dexterity of robot hands, increases the
controller complexity and thus requires to use the concept of postural
synergies. Inspired from postural synergies, this research proposes a new
framework called kernelized synergies that focuses on the re-usability of the
same subspace for precision grasping and dexterous manipulation. In this work,
the computed subspace of postural synergies; parameterized by probabilistic
movement primitives, is treated with kernel to preserve its grasping and
manipulation characteristics and allows its reuse for new objects. The grasp
stability of the proposed framework is assessed with a force closure quality
index. For performance evaluation, the proposed framework is tested on two
different simulated robot hand models using the Syngrasp toolbox and
experimentally, four complex grasping and manipulation tasks are performed and
reported. The results confirm the hand agnostic approach of the proposed
framework and its generalization to distinct objects irrespective of their

reactions is notoriously difficult, even in the simplest cases. In contrast to
normal diffusion, reaction kinetics cannot be incorporated into evolution
equations modeling subdiffusion by merely adding reaction terms to the
equations describing spatial movement. A series of previous works derived
fractional reaction-diffusion equations for the spatiotemporal evolution of
particles undergoing subdiffusion in one space dimension with linear reactions
between a finite number of discrete states. In this paper, we first give a
short and elementary proof of these previous results. We then show how this
argument gives the evolution equations for more general cases, including
subdiffusion following any fractional Fokker-Planck equation in an arbitrary
$d$-dimensional spatial domain with time-dependent reactions between infinitely
many discrete states. In contrast to previous works which employed a variety of
technical mathematical methods, our analysis reveals that the evolution
equations follow from (i) the probabilistic independence of the stochastic
spatial and discrete processes describing a single particle and (ii) the
linearity of the integro-differential operators describing spatial movement. We
also apply our results to systems combining reactions with superdiffusion.

inclinations. For the oblique impact of a Leidenfrost drop, which has a vapor
layer under its bottom surface to prevent its direct contact with the
superheated substrate, the drop can nearly frictionlessly slide along the
substrate accompanied by the spreading and the retracting. To individually
study these processes, we experimentally observe ethanol drops impact on
superheated inclined substrates using high-speed imaging from two different
views synchronously. We first study the dynamic Leidenfrost temperature, which
mainly depends on the normal Weber number ${We}_\perp $. Then the substrate
temperature is set to be high enough to study the Leidenfrost drop behaviors.
During the spreading process, drops always keep uniform. And the maximum
spreading factor $D_m/D_0$ follows a power-law dependence on the large normal
Weber number ${We}_\perp $ as $D_m/D_0 = \sqrt{We_\perp /12+2}$ for $We_\perp
\geq 30$. During the retracting process, drops with low impact velocities
become non-uniform due to the gravity effect. For the sliding process, the
residence time of all studied drops is nearly a constant, which is not affected
by the inclination and $We$ number. The frictionless vapor layer results in the
dimensionless sliding distance $L/D_0$ follows a power-law dependence on the
parallel Weber number $We_\parallel$ as $L/D_0 \propto We_\parallel^{1/2}$.
Without direct contact with the substrate, the behaviors of drops can be
separately determined by ${We}_\perp $ and $We_\parallel$. When the impact
velocity is too high, the drop fragments into many tiny droplets, which is
called the splashing phenomenon. The critical splashing criterion is found to
be $We_\perp ^*\simeq$ 120 or $K_\perp = We_\perp Re_\perp^{1/2} \simeq$ 5300

two additional novel computational units. First, we employ a feature
interaction technique by introducing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture
the way in which multiple agents interact with one another. The GNN is able to
model complex hierarchical interactions, improve the discriminative feature
learning for MOT association, and provide socially-aware context for trajectory
forecasting. Second, we use a diversity sampling function to improve the
quality and diversity of our forecasted trajectories. The learned sampling
function is trained to efficiently extract a variety of outcomes from a

malicious attackers. This practical experience report presents TZ4Fabric, an
extension of Hyperledger Fabric to leverage Arm TrustZone for the secure
execution of smart contracts. Our design minimizes the trusted computing base
executed by avoiding the execution of a whole Hyperledger Fabric node inside
the TEE, which continues to run in untrusted environment. Instead, we restrict
it to the execution of only the smart contract. The TZ4Fabric prototype
exploits the open-source OP-TEE framework, as it supports deployments on cheap
low-end devices (e.g., Raspberry Pis). Our experimental results highlight the
performance trade-off due to the additional security guarantees provided by Arm
TrustZone. TZ4Fabric will be released as open-source.

  Generative Adversarial Network",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As a widely deployed security scheme, text-based CAPTCHAs have become more
and more difficult to resist machine learning-based attacks. So far, many
researchers have conducted attacking research on text-based CAPTCHAs deployed
by different companies (such as Microsoft, Amazon, and Apple) and achieved
certain results.However, most of these attacks have some shortcomings, such as
poor portability of attack methods, requiring a series of data preprocessing
steps, and relying on large amounts of labeled CAPTCHAs. In this paper, we
propose an efficient and simple end-to-end attack method based on
cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks. Compared with previous
studies, our method greatly reduces the cost of data labeling. In addition,
this method has high portability. It can attack common text-based CAPTCHA
schemes only by modifying a few configuration parameters, which makes the
attack easier. Firstly, we train CAPTCHA synthesizers based on the cycle-GAN to
generate some fake samples. Basic recognizers based on the convolutional
recurrent neural network are trained with the fake data. Subsequently, an
active transfer learning method is employed to optimize the basic recognizer
utilizing tiny amounts of labeled real-world CAPTCHA samples. Our approach
efficiently cracked the CAPTCHA schemes deployed by 10 popular websites,
indicating that our attack is likely very general. Additionally, we analyzed
the current most popular anti-recognition mechanisms. The results show that the
combination of more anti-recognition mechanisms can improve the security of
CAPTCHA, but the improvement is limited. Conversely, generating more complex
CAPTCHAs may cost more resources and reduce the availability of CAPTCHAs.

BERT and its derivatives dominate most of the existing evaluation benchmarks,

capturing context-sensitive semantic nuances. However, there is still little
knowledge about their capabilities and potential limitations in encoding and
recovering word senses. In this article, we provide an in-depth quantitative
and qualitative analysis of the celebrated BERT model with respect to lexical
ambiguity. One of the main conclusions of our analysis is that BERT can
accurately capture high-level sense distinctions, even when a limited number of
examples is available for each word sense. Our analysis also reveals that in
some cases language models come close to solving coarse-grained noun
disambiguation under ideal conditions in terms of availability of training data

coarse-grained setting. We also perform an in-depth comparison of the two main
language model based WSD strategies, i.e., fine-tuning and feature extraction,
finding that the latter approach is more robust with respect to sense bias and
it can better exploit limited available training data. In fact, the simple
feature extraction strategy of averaging contextualized embeddings proves
robust even using only three training sentences per word sense, with minimal
improvements obtained by increasing the size of this training data.

problem. With the so-called scenario-based approach, all relevant test

particularly challenging scenarios from real driving data (\RDDwo) and assesses
their difficulty using a novel metric. Starting from the highD data, scenarios
are extracted using a hierarchical clustering approach and then assigned to one
of nine pre-defined functional scenarios using rule-based classification. The
special feature of the subsequent evaluation of the concrete scenarios is that
it is independent of the performance of the test vehicle and therefore valid
for all AVs. Previous evaluation metrics are often based on the criticality of
the scenario, which is, however, dependent on the behavior of the test vehicle
and is therefore only conditionally suitable for finding ""good"" test cases in
advance. The results show that with this new approach a reduced number of
particularly challenging test scenarios can be derived.

generally, it is the threshold field for both static and dynamic electric

positive energy attributes; within an atom they also support inter-state energy

Nonlinearity-induced chaos forms the basis for the probabilistic nature of
photon creation. Answers to physical problems at atomic and lower scales
continuously evolve because chaotic-like electron movements change their
configurations on a time scale of 10 zs. Within atoms, frequency mixing that
creates an optical frequency field occurs in the nonlinear region surrounding
the nucleus. On a probabilistic basis a ring of vacuum charge can be induced
that forms into an equivalent waveguide that confines the energy as it travels

low-latency applications for future Internet of Things (IoT)-based network
systems. Together with the increasing scholarly attention on task offloading,
the problem of edge servers' resource allocation has been widely studied. Most
of previous works focus on a single edge server (ES) serving multiple terminal
entities (TEs), which restricts their access to sufficient resources. In this
paper, we consider a MEC resource transaction market with multiple ESs and
multiple TEs, which are interdependent and mutually influence each other.
However, this many-to-many interaction requires resolving several problems,
including task allocation, TEs' selection on ESs and conflicting interests of
both parties. Game theory can be used as an effective tool to realize the
interests of two or more conflicting individuals in the trading market.
Therefore, we propose a bilateral game framework among multiple ESs and
multiple TEs by modeling the task outsourcing problem as two noncooperative
games: the supplier and customer side games. In the first game, the supply
function bidding mechanism is employed to model the ESs' profit maximization
problem. The ESs submit their bids to the scheduler, where the computing
service price is computed and sent to the TEs. While in the second game, TEs
determine the optimal demand profiles according to ESs' bids to maximize their
payoff. The existence and uniqueness of the Nash equilibrium in the
aforementioned games are proved. A distributed task outsourcing algorithm
(DTOA) is designed to determine the equilibrium. Simulation results have
demonstrated the superior performance of DTOA in increasing the ESs' profit and
TEs' payoff, as well as flattening the peak and off-peak load.

the atmosphere for eventual burial and long-term storage in the planetary
interior. This process is thought to provide an essential negative feedback to
the carbonate-silicate cycle (carbon cycle) to maintain clement climates on
Earth and potentially similar temperate exoplanets. We implement thermodynamics
to determine weathering rates as a function of surface lithology (rock type).
These rates provide upper limits that allow estimating the maximum rate of
weathering in regulating climate. This modeling shows that the weathering of
mineral assemblages in a given rock, rather than individual minerals, is
crucial to determine weathering rates at planetary surfaces. By implementing a
fluid-transport controlled approach, we further mimic chemical kinetics and
thermodynamics to determine weathering rates for three types of rocks inspired
by the lithologies of Earth's continental and oceanic crust, and its upper
mantle. We find that thermodynamic weathering rates of a continental crust-like
lithology are about one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of a
lithology characteristic of the oceanic crust. We show that when the CO$_2$
partial pressure decreases or surface temperature increases, thermodynamics
rather than kinetics exerts a strong control on weathering. The kinetically-
and thermodynamically-limited regimes of weathering depend on lithology,
whereas, the supply-limited weathering is independent of lithology. Our results
imply that the temperature-sensitivity of thermodynamically-limited silicate
weathering may instigate a positive feedback to the carbon cycle, in which the
weathering rate decreases as the surface temperature increases.

application. Conventional spectral imaging approaches have intrinsic
limitations on spatial and spectral resolutions due to the physical components

a novel multi-spectral imaging modality that enables higher spatial and
spectral resolutions. In the developed computational imaging modality, we
exploit a diffractive lens, such as a photon sieve, for both dispersing and
focusing the optical field, and achieve measurement diversity by changing the
focusing behavior of this lens. Because the focal length of a diffractive lens
is wavelength-dependent, each measurement is a superposition of differently
blurred spectral components. To reconstruct the individual spectral images from
these superimposed and blurred measurements, model-based fast reconstruction
algorithms are developed with deep and analytical priors using alternating
minimization and unrolling. Finally, the effectiveness and performance of the
developed technique is illustrated for an application in astrophysical imaging
under various observation scenarios in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) regime.
The results demonstrate that the technique provides not only
diffraction-limited high spatial resolution, as enabled by diffractive lenses,
but also the capability of resolving close-by spectral sources that would not
otherwise be possible with the existing techniques. This work enables high
resolution multi-spectral imaging with low cost designs for a variety of

Many energy functions arising from interesting applications in isotropic

  Here, we show that if an isotropic function $W$ on $\operatorname{GL}^+(n)$

already rank-one convex under strongly reduced regularity assumptions. In
particular, this generalization makes (local) ellipticity criteria accessible

directly applicable to so-called conformally invariant energy functions. We

multiple road use modalities, and require the manual curation of many
implementation plans. A recent alternative to these approaches are deep
reinforcement learning algorithms, in which an agent learns how to take the
most appropriate action for a given state of the system. This is guided by
neural networks approximating a reward function that provides feedback to the
agent regarding the performance of the actions taken, making it sensitive to
the specific reward function chosen. Several authors have surveyed the reward
functions used in the literature, but attributing outcome differences to reward
function choice across works is problematic as there are many uncontrolled
differences, as well as different outcome metrics. This paper compares the
performance of agents using different reward functions in a simulation of a
junction in Greater Manchester, UK, across various demand profiles, subject to
real world constraints: realistic sensor inputs, controllers, calibrated
demand, intergreen times and stage sequencing. The reward metrics considered
are based on the time spent stopped, lost time, change in lost time, average
speed, queue length, junction throughput and variations of these magnitudes.
The performance of these reward functions is compared in terms of total waiting
time. We find that speed maximisation resulted in the lowest average waiting
times across all demand levels, displaying significantly better performance
than other rewards previously introduced in the literature.

subscheme of affine $n$-space. The notion of motivic oscillation index of $f$
at $Z$ was initiated by Cluckers (2008) and Cluckers-Musta\c{t}\v{a}-Nguyen
(2019). In this paper we elaborate on this notion and raise several questions.
The first one is stability under base field extension; this question is linked
to a deep understanding of the density of non-archimedean local fields over
which Igusa's local zeta functions of $f$ has a pole with given real part. The
second one is around Igusa's conjecture for exponential sums with bounds in
terms of the motivic oscillation index. Thirdly, we wonder if the above
questions only depend on the analytic isomorphism class of singularities. By
using various techniques as the GAGA theorem, resolution of singularities and
model theory, we can answer the third question up to a base field extension.
Next, by using a transfer principle between non-archimedean local fields of
characteristic zero and positive characteristic, we can link all three
questions with a conjecture on weights of $\ell$-adic cohomology groups of
Artin-Schreier sheaves associated to jet polynomials. This way, we can answer
all questions positively if $f$ is a polynomial of Thom-Sebastiani type with
non-rational singularities. As a consequence, we prove Igusa's conjecture for
arbitrary polynomials in three variables and polynomials with singularities of
$ADE$ type. In an appendix, we answer affirmatively a recent question of
Cluckers-Musta\c{t}\v{a}-Nguyen (2019) on poles of twisted Igusa's local zeta

human. For instance, an ad could appear below the page fold, where a user never
scrolls. Yet, an ad is essentially ineffective if it is not at least somewhat
viewable. Ad viewability - which refers to the pixel percentage-in-view and the
exposure duration of an online display ad - has recently garnered great
interest among digital advertisers and publishers. However, we know very little
about the impact of ad viewability on advertising effectiveness. We work to
close this gap by analyzing a large-scale observational data set with more than
350,000 ad impressions similar to the data sets that are typically available to
digital advertisers and publishers. This analysis reveals that longer exposure
durations (>10 seconds) and 100% visible pixels do not appear to be optimal in
generating view-throughs. The highest view-through rates seem to be generated
with relatively lower pixel/second-combinations of 50%/1, 50%/5, 75%/1, and
75%/5. However, this analysis does not account for user behavior that may be
correlated with or even drive ad viewability and may therefore result in
endogeneity issues. Consequently, we manipulated ad viewability in a randomized
online experiment for a major European news website, finding the highest ad
recognition rates among relatively higher pixel/second-combinations of 75%/10,
100%/5 and 100%/10. Everything below 75\% or 5 seconds performs worse. Yet, we
find that it may be sufficient to have either a long exposure duration or high
pixel percentage-in-view to reach high advertising effectiveness. Our results
provide guidance to advertisers enabling them to establish target viewability
rates more appropriately and to publishers who wish to differentiate their
viewability products.

depth as independent information and design separate networks for feature
extraction from each. Such schemes can easily be constrained by a limited
amount of training data or over-reliance on an elaborately designed training
process. Inspired by the observation that RGB and depth modalities actually
present certain commonality in distinguishing salient objects, a novel joint
learning and densely cooperative fusion (JL-DCF) architecture is designed to
learn from both RGB and depth inputs through a shared network backbone, known
as the Siamese architecture. In this paper, we propose two effective
components: joint learning (JL), and densely cooperative fusion (DCF). The JL
module provides robust saliency feature learning by exploiting cross-modal
commonality via a Siamese network, while the DCF module is introduced for
complementary feature discovery. Comprehensive experiments using five popular
metrics show that the designed framework yields a robust RGB-D saliency
detector with good generalization. As a result, JL-DCF significantly advances
the state-of-the-art models by an average of ~2.0% (max F-measure) across seven
challenging datasets. In addition, we show that JL-DCF is readily applicable to
other related multi-modal detection tasks, including RGB-T (thermal infrared)
SOD and video SOD, achieving comparable or even better performance against
state-of-the-art methods. We also link JL-DCF to the RGB-D semantic
segmentation field, showing its capability of outperforming several semantic
segmentation models on the task of RGB-D SOD. These facts further confirm that
the proposed framework could offer a potential solution for various

user behavior for internal purposes and for their business customers (e.g.,

Data science researchers design algorithms, models, and approaches to improve
prediction. Prediction is also improved with larger and richer data. Beyond
improving algorithms and data, platforms can stealthily achieve better
prediction accuracy by pushing users' behaviors towards their predicted values,
using behavior modification techniques, thereby demonstrating more certain
predictions. Such apparent ""improved"" prediction can result from employing
reinforcement learning algorithms that combine prediction and behavior
modification. This strategy is absent from the machine learning and statistics
literature. Investigating its properties requires integrating causal with
predictive notation. To this end, we incorporate Pearl's causal do(.) operator
into the predictive vocabulary. We then decompose the expected prediction error
given behavior modification, and identify the components impacting predictive
power. Our derivation elucidates implications of such behavior modification to
data scientists, platforms, their customers, and the humans whose behavior is
manipulated. Behavior modification can make users' behavior more predictable
and even more homogeneous; yet this apparent predictability might not
generalize when business customers use predictions in practice. Outcomes pushed
towards their predictions can be at odds with customers' intentions, and

communities and public health, WTNs are vulnerable to cyber attacks. Effective
detection of attacks can defend WTNs against discharging contaminated water,
denying access, destroying equipment, and causing public fear. While there are
extensive studies in WTNs attack detection, they only exploit the data
characteristics partially to detect cyber attacks. After preliminary exploring
the sensing data of WTNs, we find that integrating spatio-temporal knowledge,
representation learning, and detection algorithms can improve attack detection
accuracy. To this end, we propose a structured anomaly detection framework to
defend WTNs by modeling the spatio-temporal characteristics of cyber attacks in
WTNs. In particular, we propose a spatio-temporal representation framework
specially tailored to cyber attacks after separating the sensing data of WTNs
into a sequence of time segments. This framework has two key components. The
first component is a temporal embedding module to preserve temporal patterns
within a time segment by projecting the time segment of a sensor into a
temporal embedding vector. We then construct Spatio-Temporal Graphs (STGs),
where a node is a sensor and an attribute is the temporal embedding vector of
the sensor, to describe the state of the WTNs. The second component is a
spatial embedding module, which learns the final fused embedding of the WTNs
from STGs. In addition, we devise an improved one class-SVM model that utilizes
a new designed pairwise kernel to detect cyber attacks. The devised pairwise
kernel augments the distance between normal and attack patterns in the fused
embedding space. Finally, we conducted extensive experimental evaluations with
real-world data to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

  State-of-the-Art","40 pages",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Graphs have been widely used to represent complex data in many applications.
Efficient and effective analysis of graphs is important for graph-based
applications. However, most graph analysis tasks are combinatorial optimization
(CO) problems, which are NP-hard. Recent studies have focused a lot on the
potential of using machine learning (ML) to solve graph-based CO problems. Most
recent methods follow the two-stage framework. The first stage is graph
representation learning, which embeds the graphs into low-dimension vectors.
The second stage uses ML to solve the CO problems using the embeddings of the
graphs learned in the first stage. The works for the first stage can be
classified into two categories, graph embedding (GE) methods and end-to-end
(E2E) learning methods. For GE methods, learning graph embedding has its own
objective, which may not rely on the CO problems to be solved. The CO problems
are solved by independent downstream tasks. For E2E learning methods, the
learning of graph embeddings does not have its own objective and is an
intermediate step of the learning procedure of solving the CO problems. The
works for the second stage can also be classified into two categories,
non-autoregressive methods and autoregressive methods. Non-autoregressive
methods predict a solution for a CO problem in one shot. A non-autoregressive
method predicts a matrix that denotes the probability of each node/edge being a
part of a solution of the CO problem. The solution can be computed from the
matrix. Autoregressive methods iteratively extend a partial solution step by
step. At each step, an autoregressive method predicts a node/edge conditioned
to current partial solution, which is used to its extension. In this survey, we
provide a thorough overview of recent studies of the graph learning-based CO
methods. The survey ends with several remarks on future research directions.

coffee shops, which have become intrinsic to our everyday lives. However,
serving an excellent cup of coffee is not a trivial feat as a coffee blend
typically comprises rich aromas, indulgent and unique flavours and a lingering
aftertaste. Our work addresses this by proposing a computational model which
recommends optimal coffee beans resulting from the user's preferences.
Specifically, given a set of coffee bean properties (objective features), we
apply different supervised learning techniques to predict coffee qualities
(subjective features). We then consider an unsupervised learning method to
analyse the relationship between coffee beans in the subjective feature space.
Evaluated on a real coffee beans dataset based on digitised reviews, our
results illustrate that the proposed computational model gives up to 92.7
percent recommendation accuracy for coffee beans prediction. From this, we
propose how this computational model can be deployed on a service robot to
reliably predict customers' coffee bean preferences, starting from the user
inputting their coffee preferences to the robot recommending the coffee beans
that best meet the user's likings.

challenging problem in machine learning. The problem exists in applications
where only a subset of sensors are deployed at certain spots or partial
responses are collected in field surveys. Existing research mostly focuses on
addressing incomplete or missing data, e.g., data cleaning and imputation,
classification models that allow for missing feature values or model missing
features as hidden variables in the EM algorithm. These methods, however,
assume that incomplete feature observations only happen on a small subset of
samples, and thus cannot solve problems where the vast majority of samples have
missing feature observations. To address this issue, we recently proposed a new
approach that incorporates physics-aware structural constraint into the model
representation. Our approach assumes that a spatial contextual feature is
observed for all sample locations and establishes spatial structural constraint
from the underlying spatial contextual feature map. We design efficient
algorithms for model parameter learning and class inference. This paper extends
our recent approach by allowing feature values of samples in each class to
follow a multi-modal distribution. We propose learning algorithms for the
extended model with multi-modal distribution. Evaluations on real-world
hydrological applications show that our approach significantly outperforms
baseline methods in classification accuracy, and the multi-modal extension is
more robust than our early single-modal version especially when feature
distribution in training samples is multi-modal. Computational experiments show
that the proposed solution is computationally efficient on large datasets.

bus capacity, a maximum student walking distance to a pickup point, and a
maximum commute time for each student. This is a special case of the Vehicle
Routing Problem (VRP) with a common destination. We propose a decomposition
approach for solving this problem based on the existing notion of a
shareability network, which has been used recently in the context of dynamic
ridepooling problems. Moreover, we come up with a simplified formulation for
solving the SSRP by introducing the connection between the SSRP and the
weighted set covering problem (WSCP). To scale this method to large-scale
problem instances, we propose i) a node compression method for the shareability
network based decomposition approach, and ii) heuristic-based edge pruning
techniques that perform well in practice. We show that the compressed problem
leads to an Integer Linear Program (ILP) of reduced dimensionality that can be
solved efficiently using off-the-shelf ILP solvers. Numerical experiments on
the synthetic Boston Public School (BPS) instances are conducted to evaluate
the performance of our approach. Meanwhile, our proposed SSRP formulation
