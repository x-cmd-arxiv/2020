industry to develop novel congestion control methods. LearningCC is presented
in this letter, in which the congestion control problem is solved by reinforce
learning approach. Instead of adjusting the congestion window with fixed
policy, there are serval options for an endpoint to choose. To predict the best
option is a hard task. Each option is mapped as an arm of a bandit machine. The
endpoint can learn to determine the optimal choice through trial and error
method. Experiments are performed on ns3 platform to verify the effectiveness
of LearningCC by comparing with other benchmark algorithms. Results indicate it
can achieve lower transmission delay than loss based algorithms. Especially, we
found LearningCC makes significant improvement in link suffering from random
loss.

distinguished from noise transients in a detector network through Bayesian
model selection by exploiting the coherence of the signal across the network.
We present a Bayesian framework for calculating the posterior probability that
a signal is of astrophysical origin, agnostic to the specific search strategy,
pipeline or search domain with which a candidate is identified. We apply this
framework under \textit{identical} assumptions to all events reported in the
LIGO-Virgo GWTC-1 catalog, GW190412 and numerous event candidates reported by
independent search pipelines by other authors. With the exception of GW170818,
we find that all GWTC-1 candidates, and GW190412, have odds overwhelmingly in
favour of the astrophysical hypothesis, including GW170729, which was assigned
significantly different astrophysical probabilities by the different search
pipelines used in GWTC-1. GW170818 is de-facto a single detector trigger, and
is therefore of no surprise that it is disfavoured as being produced by an
astrophysical source in our framework. We find \textit{three} additional event
candidates, GW170121, GW170425 and GW170727, that have significant support for
the astrophysical hypothesis, with a probability that the signal is of
astrophysical origin of 0.53, 0.74 and 0.64 respectively. We carry out a
hierarchical population study which includes these three events in addition to
those reported in GWTC-1, finding that the main astrophysical results are
unaffected.

(and as part of them lake ice) is therefore considered an Essential Climate
Variable (ECV) of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Following the
need for an integrated multi-temporal monitoring of lake ice in Switzerland,
MeteoSwiss in the framework of GCOS Switzerland supported this 2-year project
to explore not only the use of satellite images but also the possibilities of
Webcams and in-situ measurements. The aim of this project is to monitor some
target lakes and detect the extent of ice and especially the ice-on/off dates,
with focus on the integration of various input data and processing methods. The
target lakes are: St. Moritz, Silvaplana, Sils, Sihl, Greifen and Aegeri,
whereby only the first four were mainly frozen during the observation period
and thus processed. The observation period was mainly the winter 2016-17.
During the project, various approaches were developed, implemented, tested and
compared. Firstly, low spatial resolution (250 - 1000 m) but high temporal
resolution (1 day) satellite images from the optical sensors MODIS and VIIRS
were used. Secondly, and as a pilot project, the use of existing public Webcams
was investigated for (a) validation of results from satellite data, and (b)
independent estimation of lake ice, especially for small lakes like St. Moritz,
that could not be possibly monitored in the satellite images. Thirdly, in-situ
measurements were made in order to characterize the development of the
temperature profiles and partly pressure before freezing and under the
ice-cover until melting. This report presents the results of the project work.

preexisting static maps and are error-prone in dynamic environments.
Furthermore, for safety reasons, they often rely on hand-crafted safety
guidelines, which makes the system less flexible and slow. Visual based
navigation and high level semantics bear the potential to enhance the safety of
path planing by creating links the agent can reason about for a more flexible

navigation system which learns navigation behavior based solely on visual
observations to cope with highly dynamic environments. Therefore, we develop a

shown to be of great interest to describe the characteristics of a social

links are undirected, such as friendship links (Facebook) or professional links

former studies have missed much of the information contained in the directed

We additionally provide the values of the formerly introduced directed and

restricting the search to a family of simple models, that we call Minimally
Complex Models (MCMs). These are spin models, with interactions of arbitrary
order, that are composed of independent components of minimal complexity
(Beretta et al., 2018). They tend to be simple in information theoretic terms,
which means that they are well-fitted to specific types of data, and are
therefore easy to falsify. We show that Bayesian model selection restricted to
these models is computationally feasible and has many other advantages. First,
their evidence, which trades off goodness-of-fit against model complexity, can
be computed easily without any parameter fitting. This allows selecting the
best MCM among all, even though the number of models is astronomically large.
Furthermore, MCMs can be inferred and sampled from without any computational
effort. Finally, model selection among MCMs is invariant with respect to
changes in the representation of the data. MCMs portray the structure of
dependencies among variables in a simple way, as illustrated in several
examples, and thus provide robust predictions on dependencies in the data. MCMs
contain interactions of any order between variables, and thus may reveal the
presence of interactions of order higher than pairwise.

confining potential of the double quantum wells results in a gap opening which
is absent in the symmetric system where it can only be induced by an applied

coupling which is a consequence of the asymmetry of the confining potential.
The electron-like and hole-like states are mainly confined in different quantum

hybridization gap at a finite in-plane wavevector. We show that both the ratio
of the widths of the two quantum wells and the mole fraction of the

recently by the authors [1-3], the RVM framework can be derived as an effective
gravitational field theory stemming from underlying microscopic (critical)
string theory models with gravitational anomalies, involving condensation of
primordial gravitational waves. Although believed to be a classical scalar
field description, not representing a fully fledged quantum field, nonetheless
we show here that the vacuumon potential satisfies certain Swampland criteria
for the relevant regime of parameters and field range. We link the criteria to
the Gibbons-Hawking entropy that has been argued to characterise the RVM during
the de Sitter phase. These results imply that the vacuumon may, after all,
admit under certain conditions, a r\^ole as a quantum field during the
inflationary (almost de Sitter) phase of the running vacuum. The conventional
slow-roll interpretation of this field, however, fails just because it
satisfies the Swampland criteria. The RVM effective theory derived from the
low-energy effective action of string theory does, however, successfully
describe inflation thanks to the $\sim H^4$ terms induced by the gravitational
anomalous condensates. In addition, the stringy version of the RVM involves the
Kalb-Ramond (KR) axion field, which, in contrast to the vacuumon, does
perfectly satisfy the slow-roll condition. We conclude that the vacuumon
description is not fully equivalent to the stringy formulation of the RVM.

superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). Such an effect is also
shown to modify the Heisenberg equation of motion of the boson field operator
in the two-mode approximation, where a hysteretic contribution that could
affect the dynamics for accelerated or overlapping barriers is identified. By
studying the energy landscape as a function of order and control parameters, we
determine the diagram with the location of the dc and ac Josephson regimes,
along with the critical points that are shown to depend on the junctions
position. We analyze the dc to ac Josephson transition for adiabatic barrier
trajectories that lead to a final uniform velocity, or which perform symmetric
velocity paths. We show that such symmetric trajectories may induce, when
reaching the critical point, highly hysteretic oscillating return paths within
the dc regime, similar to the underdamped hysteresis loops arising from the
action of a resistive flow in the ac regime. We also consider nonequilibrium
initial conditions resulting from a finite phase difference on either side of
the junctions, along with the critical features of such a parameter. An
excellent agreement between the Gross-Pitaevskii simulations and the two-mode

to the spectral theorem by using the terms of the matrix initially extracted.
The diagonal terms of the rotated matrix, that is, the impedances $Z_{\chi_1}$

model representation of the anisotropic element can be used to analyse
anisotropic FSSs rotated by a generic azimuth angle. The methodology provides a
compact description of generic FSS elements with only five parameters: the
lumped parameters of the LC network $L_{\chi_1}$, $C_{\chi_1}$, $L_{\chi_2}$,
$C_{\chi_2}$ and the rotation angle $\varphi^{rot}$. The circuit model can take
into account the presence of dielectric substrates close to the FSS or a

variation of the well-known expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, called the
stochastic EM algorithm (SEM), is developed. It is shown that the SEM algorithm
avoids calculation of complicated expectations, which is a major advantage of
the SEM algorithm over the EM algorithm. The proposed procedure also allows the
objective function to be split into two simpler functions, one corresponding to
the parameters associated with the cure rate and the other corresponding to the
parameters associated with the progression times. The advantage of this
approach is that each simple function, with lower parameter dimension, can be
maximized independently. An extensive Monte Carlo simulation study is carried
out to compare the performances of the SEM and EM algorithms. Finally, a breast

demonstrated their efficiency in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification.
These methods can automatically learn spectral-spatial discriminative features
within local patches. However, for each pixel in an HSI, it is not only related
to its nearby pixels but also has connections to pixels far away from itself.
Therefore, to incorporate the long-range contextual information, a deep fully
convolutional network (FCN) with an efficient non-local module, named ENL-FCN,
is proposed for HSI classification. In the proposed framework, a deep FCN
considers an entire HSI as input and extracts spectral-spatial information in a
local receptive field. The efficient non-local module is embedded in the
network as a learning unit to capture the long-range contextual information.
Different from the traditional non-local neural networks, the long-range
contextual information is extracted in a specially designed criss-cross path
for computation efficiency. Furthermore, by using a recurrent operation, each
pixel's response is aggregated from all pixels of HSI. The benefits of our
proposed ENL-FCN are threefold: 1) the long-range contextual information is
incorporated effectively, 2) the efficient module can be freely embedded in a
deep neural network in a plug-and-play fashion, and 3) it has much fewer
learning parameters and requires less computational resources. The experiments
conducted on three popular HSI datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art classification performance with lower computational
cost in comparison with several leading deep neural networks for HSI.

language. However, it is still unclear to what extent neural LID models
generalize to speech samples with different acoustic conditions due to domain
shift. In this paper, we present a set of experiments to investigate the impact
of domain mismatch on the performance of neural LID systems for a subset of six
Slavic languages across two domains (read speech and radio broadcast) and
examine two low-level signal descriptors (spectral and cepstral features) for
this task. Our experiments show that (1) out-of-domain speech samples severely
hinder the performance of neural LID models, and (2) while both spectral and
cepstral features show comparable performance within-domain, spectral features
show more robustness under domain mismatch. Moreover, we apply unsupervised
domain adaptation to minimize the discrepancy between the two domains in our
study. We achieve relative accuracy improvements that range from 9% to 77%
depending on the diversity of acoustic conditions in the source domain.

The unknown calibration parameters can be estimated from real data by
conducting physical experiments. This paper presents an approach to optimally
design such a physical experiment. The problem of optimally designing physical
experiment, using a computer model, is similar to the problem of finding
optimal design for fitting nonlinear models. However, the problem is more
challenging than the existing work on nonlinear optimal design because of the
possibility of model discrepancy, that is, the computer model may not be an
accurate representation of the true underlying model. Therefore, we propose an
optimal design approach that is robust to potential model discrepancies. We
show that our designs are better than the commonly used physical experimental
designs that do not make use of the information contained in the computer model
and other nonlinear optimal designs that ignore potential model discrepancies.
We illustrate our approach using a toy example and a real example from

transportation applications, such as being surrogate safety measures for
traffic safety research and corner case data for automated vehicle testing.
However, there are several key challenges for near-crash detection. First,
extracting near-crashes from original data sources requires significant
computing, communication, and storage resources. Also, existing methods lack
efficiency and transferability, which bottlenecks prospective large-scale
applications. To this end, this paper leverages the power of edge computing to
address these challenges by processing the video streams from existing dashcams
onboard in a real-time manner. We design a multi-thread system architecture
that operates on edge devices and model the bounding boxes generated by object
detection and tracking in linear complexity. The method is insensitive to
camera parameters and backward compatible with different vehicles. The edge
computing system has been evaluated with recorded videos and real-world tests
on two cars and four buses for over ten thousand hours. It filters out
irrelevant videos in real-time thereby saving labor cost, processing time,
network bandwidth, and data storage. It collects not only event videos but also
other valuable data such as road user type, event location, time to collision,
vehicle trajectory, vehicle speed, brake switch, and throttle. The experiments
demonstrate the promising performance of the system regarding efficiency,
accuracy, reliability, and transferability. It is among the first efforts in
applying edge computing for real-time traffic video analytics and is expected
to benefit multiple sub-fields in smart transportation research and
applications.

proposed method uses a multi-step, second-order temporal discretization with a

algorithm is linear at each time level, and decouples the evolution equations
from the velocity filter step. Since the indicator function chosen in this
model is mathematically based on approximation theory, the proposed numerical
algorithm can be analyzed robustly, i.e the stability and convergence of the
method is provable. A series of numerical tests are carried out to verify the
theoretical convergence rates, and to compare the algorithm with direct
numerical simulation and the usual Leray-$\alpha$ model of the flow problem.

In 1949, he introduced his instant form to exclude time-like oscillations. He
also introduced the light-cone coordinate system for Lorentz boosts. Also in
1949, he stated the Lie algebra of the inhomogeneous Lorentz group can serve as
the uncertainty relations in the Lorentz-covariant world. It is possible to
integrate these three papers to produce the harmonic oscillator wave function
which can be Lorentz-transformed. In addition, Dirac, in 1963, considered two
coupled oscillators to derive the Lie algebra for the generators of the
$O(3,\,2)$ de Sitter group, which has ten generators. It is proven possible to
contract this group to the inhomogeneous Lorentz group with ten generators,

how to compute the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the cumulative

biochemically quantitative technologies targeting digital histopathology.
Conventional histopathology relies on chemical stains that alter tissue color.
This approach is qualitative, often making histopathologic examination
subjective and difficult to quantify. MIRSI addresses these challenges through
quantitative and repeatable imaging that leverages native molecular contrast.
Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) imaging, the best-known MIRSI technology, has
two challenges that have hindered its widespread adoption: data collection
speed and spatial resolution. Recent technological breakthroughs, such as
photothermal MIRSI, provide an order of magnitude improvement in spatial
resolution. However, this comes at the cost of acquisition speed, which is
impractical for clinical tissue samples. This paper introduces an adaptive
compressive sampling technique to reduce hyperspectral data acquisition time by
an order of magnitude by leveraging spectral and spatial sparsity. This method
identifies the most informative spatial and spectral features, integrates a
fast tensor completion algorithm to reconstruct megapixel-scale images, and
demonstrates speed advantages over FTIR imaging while providing spatial
resolutions comparable to new photothermal approaches.

landscape and dramatically disrupted the Vehicle for Hire (VFH) market that
used to be dominated by taxicabs for many years. Since first being introduced
by Uber in 2009, ridesourcing companies have rapidly penetrated the market.
This paper aims to investigate temporal and spatial patterns in taxi and TNC
usage based on data at the taxi zone level in New York City. Specifically, we
fit suitable time series models to estimate the temporal patterns. Next, we
filter out the temporal effects and investigate spatial dependence in the
residuals using global and local Moran's I statistics. We discuss the
relationship between the spatial correlations and the demographic and land use
effects at the taxi zone level. Estimating and removing these effects via a
multiple linear regression (MLR) model and recomputing the Moran's I statistics
on the resulting residuals enables us to investigate spatial dependence after
accounting for these effects. Our analysis indicates interesting patterns in
spatial correlations between taxi zones in NYC and over time, indicating that
predictive modeling of ridesourcing usage must incorporate both temporal and
spatial dependence.

further derive the two-component analytical solutions of the static EL
equations for a polydomain 180-degree domain structure in a multiaxial

thickness and boundary conditions at its surfaces allows to select the domain
states corresponding to the minimal energy. The single-domain state is ground
for zero polarization derivative at the surfaces, while the poly-domain states
minimize the system energy for zero polarization at the surfaces.
Counterintuitively, the energy of the polydomain states split into two levels 0

obtained from both types of Borel representations in general differ as well,
and the apparently conflicting behavior of the FOPT and CIPT spectral function
moment series at intermediate orders, which has been subject to many studies in
the past literature, can be understood quantitatively using concrete Borel
function models. The difference between the CIPT and FOPT Borel sums, which we
call the ""asymptotic separation"", can be computed analytically for any Borel
function model and is proportional to inverse exponential terms in the strong
coupling. Even though moments can be designed where the asymptotic separation
is strongly suppressed, it is as a matter of principle unavoidable. If the
Borel function of the Euclidean Adler function has a sizeable gluon condensate
renormalon cut, the asymptotic separation can explain the observed disparity of
the CIPT and FOPT spectral function moments at the 5-loop level. The existence
of the asymptotic separation implies that the power corrections in the operator
product expansion for the spectral function moments in the CIPT expansion
approach do not have the commonly assumed analytic standard form.

String theory, a potentially unifying framework that encompasses quantum

introducing a fictitious external field that breaks chiral symmetry, we further
observe an intriguing transition in the spectrum, characterized by spectral

  Approach: A custom-designed impact testing rig was used to deliver 0.9 J and
1.4 J impact energies to bovine articular cartilage. A total of 55 (n=28
healthy, n=27 mildly degenerate) cartilage-on-bone samples were imaged before,
immediately after, and 3 hours after impact. PS-OCT images were analysed to
assess changes relating to surface irregularity, optical attenuation, and
birefringence.
  Results: Mildly degenerate cartilage exhibits a significant change in
birefringence following 1.4 J impact energies compared to healthy samples which
is believed to be attributable to degenerate cartilage being unable to fully
utilise the fluid phase to distribute and dampen the energy. After rehydration,
the polarisation-sensitive images appear to `optically-recover' reducing the
reliability of birefringence as an absolute metric. Surface irregularity and
optical attenuation encode diagnostically relevant information and may serve as

rooted in the well known Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach, we overcome
the notorious problem of slow mixing by a new idea for generating a random
sample from among the independent sets. A key tool that enables the result is a
solution to a novel sampling task that we call Subset Sampling. In its basic
form, a stationary sample is given from the (exponentially large) state space
of a Markov chain, as input, and we want to transform it into another
stationary sample that is conditioned on falling into a given subset, which is
still exponentially large. In general, Subset Sampling can be both harder and
easier than stationary sampling from a Markov chain. It can be harder, due to
the conditioning on a subset, which may have more complex structure than the
original state space. But it may also be easier, since a stationary sample is
already given, which, in a sense, already encompasses ""most of the hardness"" of
such sampling tasks, being already in the stationary distribution, which is
hard to reach in a slowly mixing chain. We show that it is possible to
efficiently balance the two sides: we can capitalize on already having a
stationary sample from the original space, so that the complexity of confining
it to a subset is mitigated. We prove that an efficient approximation is
possible for the considered sampling task, and then it is applied recursively

analyzing quasi-experimental settings, such as difference-in-differences (DiD).
A key feature of our framework is that each unit has an idiosyncratic treatment
probability that is unknown to the researcher and may be related to the
potential outcomes. We derive formulas for the bias of common estimators
(including DiD), and provide conditions under which they are unbiased for an
intrepretable causal estimand (e.g., analogs to the ATE or ATT). We further
show that when the finite population is large, conventional standard errors are
valid but typically conservative estimates of the variance of the estimator
over the randomization distribution. An interesting feature of our framework is
that conventional standard errors tend to become more conservative when
treatment probabilities vary across units. This conservativeness helps to
(partially) mitigate the undercoverage of confidence intervals when the
estimator is biased. Thus, for example, confidence intervals for the DiD
estimator can have correct coverage for the average treatment effect on the
treated even if the parallel trends assumption does not hold exactly. We show
that these dynamics can be important in simulations calibrated to real
labor-market data. Our results also have implications for the appropriate level
to cluster standard errors, and for the analysis of linear covariate adjustment

in order to facilitate efficient transmission and storage. This introduces an
unavoidable tension between the allocated bit-budget (rate) and the
faithfulness of the resulting image to the original one (distortion). An
additional complicating consideration is the effect of the compression on
recognition performance by given classifiers (accuracy). This work aims to
explore this rate-distortion-accuracy tradeoff. As a case study, we focus on
the design of the quantization tables in the JPEG compression standard. We
offer a novel optimal tuning of these tables via continuous optimization,
leveraging a differential implementation of both the JPEG encoder-decoder and
an entropy estimator. This enables us to offer a unified framework that

self-attention networks (SAN), have achieved state-of-art performance. But an
expressive corpus with rich prosody is still challenging to model as 1)
prosodic aspects, which span across different sentential granularities and
mainly determine acoustic expressiveness, are difficult to quantize and label
and 2) the current seq2seq framework extracts prosodic information solely from
a text encoder, which is easily collapsed to an averaged expression for
expressive contents. In this paper, we propose a context extractor, which is
built upon SAN-based text encoder, to sufficiently exploit the sentential
context over an expressive corpus for seq2seq-based TTS. Our context extractor
first collects prosodic-related sentential context information from different
SAN layers and then aggregates them to learn a comprehensive sentence
representation to enhance the expressiveness of the final generated speech.
Specifically, we investigate two methods of context aggregation: 1) direct
aggregation which directly concatenates the outputs of different SAN layers,
and 2) weighted aggregation which uses multi-head attention to automatically
learn contributions for different SAN layers. Experiments on two expressive
corpora show that our approach can produce more natural speech with much richer
prosodic variations, and weighted aggregation is more superior in modeling
expressivity.

divergence due to the collinear and soft modes residing in disparate phase
spaces. The idea of an effective theory is applied to a system of collinear
modes with large rapidity and soft modes with small rapidity. The
large-rapidity (collinear) modes are integrated out to obtain the effective
theory for the small-rapidity (soft) modes. The full SCET with the collinear
and soft modes should be matched onto the soft theory at the rapidity boundary,
and the matching procedure becomes exactly the zero-bin subtraction. The
large-rapidity region is out of reach for the soft mode, which results in the
rapidity divergence. The rapidity divergence in the collinear sector comes from
the zero-bin subtraction, which ensures the cancellation of the rapidity
divergences from the soft and collinear sectors. In order to treat the rapidity
divergence, we construct the rapidity regulators consistently for all the
modes. They are generalized by assigning independent rapidity scales for
different collinear directions. The soft regulator incorporates the correct
directional dependence when the innate collinear directions are not
back-to-back, which is discussed in the $N$-jet operator. As an application, we
consider the Sudakov form factor for the back-to-back collinear current and the
soft-collinear current, where the soft rapidity regulator for a soft quark is
developed. We extend the analysis to the boosted heavy quark sector and exploit
the delicacy with the presence of the heavy quark mass. We present the resummed
results of large logarithms in the form factors for various currents with the

suggests that the RIS-assisted wireless channel can be approximated by a Rician
distribution. Analytical expressions are derived for the shape factor and the
scale factor of the distribution. For the case of continuous phase shifts, the
distribution depends on the number of elements of the RIS and the observing
direction of the receiver. For the case of continuous phase shifts, the

AVTacotron2 converts a sequence of phonemes representing the sentence to

are used to generate the corresponding video of the talking face. The second

and light-weight transformation, and (2) across blocks using block-wise
scaling, which allows for shallower and narrower DeLighT blocks near the input
and wider and deeper DeLighT blocks near the output. Overall, DeLighT networks
are 2.5 to 4 times deeper than standard transformer models and yet have fewer
parameters and operations. Experiments on benchmark machine translation and
language modeling tasks show that DeLighT matches or improves the performance
of baseline Transformers with 2 to 3 times fewer parameters on average. Our

differences expressed as subtle changes in neuronal arborization rather than
easy to assay features such as cell count. The need to analyze morphology,
growth, and intracellular transport has motivated the development of
increasingly sophisticated microscopes and image analysis techniques. Due to
its high-contrast, high-specificity output, many assays rely on confocal
fluorescence microscopy, genetic methods, or antibody staining techniques.
These approaches often limit the ability to measure quantitatively dynamic
activity such as intracellular transport and growth. In this work, we describe
a method for label-free live-cell cell imaging with antibody staining
specificity by estimating the associated fluorescent signals via quantitative
phase imaging and deep convolutional neural networks. This computationally
inferred fluorescence image is then used to generate a semantic segmentation
map, annotating subcellular compartments of live unlabeled neural cultures.
These synthetic fluorescence maps were further applied to study the time-lapse
development of hippocampal neurons, highlighting the relationships between the
cellular dry mass production and the dynamic transport activity within the
nucleus and neurites. Our implementation provides a high-throughput strategy to
analyze neural network arborization dynamically, with high specificity and

distributed patterns of activity across neurons. An important figure of merit
of population codes is how much information about the original stimulus can be
decoded from them. Fisher information is widely used to quantify coding
precision and specify optimal codes, because of its relationship to mean
squared error (MSE) under certain assumptions. When neural firing is sparse,
however, optimizing Fisher information can result in codes that are highly
sub-optimal in terms of MSE. We find that this discrepancy arises from the
non-local component of error not accounted for by the Fisher information. Using
this insight, we construct optimal population codes by directly minimizing the
MSE. We study the scaling properties of MSE with coding parameters, focusing on
the tuning curve width. We find that the optimal tuning curve width for coding
no longer scales as the inverse population size, and the quadratic scaling of
precision with system size predicted by Fisher information alone no longer
holds. However, superlinearity is still preserved with only a logarithmic
slowdown. We derive analogous results for networks storing the memory of a
stimulus through continuous attractor dynamics, and show that similar scaling
properties optimize memory and representation.

examined the energetics of focusing wave groups in deep and intermediate depth
water and found that breaking and non-breaking regimes were clearly separated
by the normalised energy flux, $B$, near the crest tip. Furthermore, the
transition of $B$ through a generic breaking threshold value $B_\mathrm{th}
\approx 0.85$ was found to precede visible breaking onset by up to one fifth of
a wave period. This remarkable generic threshold for breaking inception has
since been validated numerically for 2D and 3D domains and for shallow and
shoaling water waves; however, there is presently no theoretical explanation

  Astrophysical Journal",,,,"astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Alfv\'en waves are responsible for the transfer of magnetic energy in the
magnetized plasma. They are involved in heating solar atmosphere and driving
solar wind through various nonlinear processes. Since the magnetic field
configurations directly affect the nonlinearity of Alfv\'en waves, it is
important to investigate how they relate to the solar atmosphere and wind
structure through the nonlinear propagation of Alfv\'en waves. In this study,
we carried out the one-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to realize
the above relation. The results show that when the nonlinearity of Alfv\'en
waves in the chromosphere exceeds a critical value, the dynamics of the solar
chromosphere (e.g., spicule) and the mass loss rate of solar wind tend to be
independent of the energy input from the photosphere. In a situation where the
Alfv\'en waves are highly nonlinear, the strong shear torsional flow generated
in the chromosphere ``fractures'' the magnetic flux tube. This corresponds to
the formation of chromospheric intermediate shocks, which limit the
transmission of the Poynting flux into the corona by Alfv\'en waves and also
inhibits the propagation of chromospheric slow shock.

estimation and mapping in real-time for robotics applications. We utilize
spatial GP regression to model the environment. This tool enables us to recover
surfaces including those in sparsely scanned areas and obtain uniform samples
with uncertainty. Those properties facilitate robust data association and map
updating in our scan-to-map registration scheme, especially when working with
sparse range data. Compared with previous GP-SLAM, this work overcomes the
prohibitive computational complexity of GP and redesigns the registration
strategy to meet the accuracy requirements in 3D scenarios. For large-scale
tasks, a two-thread framework is employed to suppress the drift further. Aerial
and ground-based experiments demonstrate that our method allows robust odometry
and precise mapping in real-time. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art
lidar SLAM systems in our tests with light-weight sensors.

overall query complexity of interactively learning binary classifiers. The
\textit{positivity comparison oracle} is used to provide feedback on which is
more likely to be positive given a pair of data points. Because it is
impossible to infer accurate labels using this oracle alone \textit{without
knowing the classification threshold}, existing methods still rely on the
traditional \textit{explicit labeling oracle}, which directly answers the label
given a data point. Existing methods conduct sorting on all data points and use
explicit labeling oracle to find the classification threshold. The current
methods, however, have two drawbacks: (1) they needs unnecessary sorting for
label inference; (2) quick sort is naively adapted to noisy feedback and
negatively affects practical performance. In order to avoid this inefficiency
and acquire information of the classification threshold, we propose a new
pairwise comparison oracle concerning uncertainties. This oracle receives two
data points as input and answers which one has higher uncertainty. We then
propose an efficient adaptive labeling algorithm using the proposed oracle and
the positivity comparison oracle. In addition, we also address the situation
where the labeling budget is insufficient compared to the dataset size, which
can be dealt with by plugging the proposed algorithm into an active learning
algorithm. Furthermore, we confirm the feasibility of the proposed oracle and
the performance of the proposed algorithm theoretically and empirically.

approximation theory whose applicability is not restricted to Laplace

fast, high-order accurate evaluation of layer potentials near and on the source
layer. GIGAQBX is based on the FMM, but unlike a conventional FMM, which is
designed to evaluate potentials at point-shaped targets, GIGAQBX evaluates
local expansions of potentials at ball-shaped targets. Although the accuracy
(or the acceleration error, i.e., error due to the approximation of the
potential by the fast algorithm) of the conventional FMM is well understood,
the acceleration error of FMM-based algorithms applied to the evaluation of
local expansions has not been as well studied. The main contribution of this
paper is a proof of a set of hypotheses first demonstrated numerically in the
paper ""A Fast Algorithm for Quadrature by Expansion in Three Dimensions,"" which
pertain to the accuracy of FMM approximation of local expansions of Laplace
potentials in three dimensions. These hypotheses are also essential to the
three-dimensional error bound for GIGAQBX, which was previously stated
conditionally on their truth and can now be stated unconditionally.

individuals lead to moving fronts that invade into vacant regions, are
routinely studied using partial differential equation (PDE) models based upon
the classical Fisher--KPP model. While the Fisher--KPP model and extensions
have been successfully used to model a range of invasive phenomena, including
ecological and cellular invasion, an often--overlooked limitation of the
Fisher--KPP model is that it cannot be used to model biological recession where
the spatial extent of the population decreases with time. In this work we study
the \textit{Fisher--Stefan} model, which is a generalisation of the Fisher--KPP
model obtained by reformulating the Fisher--KPP model as a moving boundary
problem. The nondimensional Fisher--Stefan model involves just one single
parameter, $\kappa$, which relates the shape of the density front at the moving
boundary to the speed of the associated travelling wave, $c$. Using numerical
simulation, phase plane and perturbation analysis, we construct approximate
solutions of the Fisher--Stefan model for both slowly invading and slowly
receding travelling waves, as well as for rapidly receding travelling waves.
These approximations allow us to determine the relationship between $c$ and
$\kappa$ so that commonly--reported experimental estimates of $c$ can be used
to provide estimates of the unknown parameter $\kappa$. Interestingly, when we
reinterpret the Fisher--KPP model as a moving boundary problem, many
disregarded features of the classical Fisher--KPP phase plane take on a new
interpretation since travelling waves solutions with $c < 2$ are not normally
considered. This means that our analysis of the Fisher--Stefan model has both
practical value and an inherent mathematical value.

Identification (ADI) using intonation patterns and acoustic representations.
Recent approaches to language and dialect identification use linguistic-aware
deep architectures that are able to capture phonetic differences amongst
languages and dialects. Specifically, in ADI tasks, different combinations of
linguistic features and acoustic representations have been successful with deep
learning models. The approach presented in this article uses intonation
patterns and hybrid residual and bidirectional LSTM networks to learn acoustic
embeddings with no additional linguistic information. Results of the
experiments show that intonation patterns for Arabic dialects provide
sufficient information to achieve state-of-the-art results on the VarDial 17
ADI dataset, outperforming single-feature systems. The pipeline presented is
robust to data sparsity, in contrast to other deep learning approaches that
require large quantities of data. We conjecture on the importance of sufficient
information as a criterion for optimality in a deep learning ADI task, and more
generally, its application to acoustic modeling problems. Small intonation
patterns, when sufficient in an information-theoretic sense, allow deep
learning architectures to learn more accurate speech representations.

Unfortunately, there are some tensions between different datasets, especially
the most precise ones, which have not been resolved so far. Additional
independent constraints on the data are therefore of interest. We consider a
parametrization-free method of analytic extrapolation proposed recently, which
is based on a mixed phase and modulus extremal problem and combines rigorous
upper and lower bounds with numerical simulations to account for the
statistical distributions of the input and output values. Spacelike data on the
form factor and measurements of the modulus in the region $(0.65-0.71)$ GeV are
used as input. In previous works, the formalism was applied for extrapolating
the form factor to low energies. In the present work, we use it as a stringent
and model-independent test of consistency with analyticity and unitarity for
the high-statistics data around the $\rho$ resonance. The study reveals some
inconsistencies, in particular below the $\rho$ peak the BABAR data are
slightly higher than the band of extrapolated values, while above the $\rho$
peak all the data are situated at the lower edge of the band. The implications

  Processing",,"10.1109/TASLP.2021.3071662",,"eess.AS","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In recent years, there has been a great deal of research in developing
end-to-end speech recognition models, which enable simplifying the traditional
pipeline and achieving promising results. Despite their remarkable performance
improvements, end-to-end models typically require expensive computational cost
to show successful performance. To reduce this computational burden, knowledge
distillation (KD), which is a popular model compression method, has been used
to transfer knowledge from a deep and complex model (teacher) to a shallower
and simpler model (student). Previous KD approaches have commonly designed the
architecture of the student model by reducing the width per layer or the number
of layers of the teacher model. This structural reduction scheme might limit
the flexibility of model selection since the student model structure should be
similar to that of the given teacher. To cope with this limitation, we propose
a new KD method for end-to-end speech recognition, namely TutorNet, that can
transfer knowledge across different types of neural networks at the hidden
representation-level as well as the output-level. For concrete realizations, we
firstly apply representation-level knowledge distillation (RKD) during the
initialization step, and then apply the softmax-level knowledge distillation
(SKD) combined with the original task learning. When the student is trained
with RKD, we make use of frame weighting that points out the frames to which
the teacher model pays more attention. Through a number of experiments on
LibriSpeech dataset, it is verified that the proposed method not only distills
the knowledge between networks with different topologies but also significantly
contributes to improving the word error rate (WER) performance of the distilled
student. Interestingly, TutorNet allows the student model to surpass its
teacher's performance in some particular cases.

basis for the fifth-generation new radio (5G-NR) waveform developments.
However, effective signal processing tools are needed for enhancing the OFDM
spectrum in various advanced transmission scenarios. In earlier work, we have
shown that fast-convolution (FC) processing is a very flexible and efficient
tool for filtered-OFDM signal generation and receiver-side subband filtering,
e.g., for the mixed-numerology scenarios of the 5G-NR. FC filtering
approximates linear convolution through effective fast Fourier transform
(FFT)-based circular convolutions using partly overlapping processing blocks.
However, with the continuous overlap-and-save and overlap-and-add processing
models with fixed block-size and fixed overlap, the FC-processing blocks cannot
be aligned with all OFDM symbols of a transmission frame. Furthermore, 5G-NR
numerology does not allow to use transform lengths shorter than 128 because
this would lead to non-integer cyclic prefix (CP) lengths. In this article, we
present new FC-processing schemes which solve the mentioned limitations. These
schemes are based on dynamically adjusting the overlap periods and
extrapolating the CP samples, which make it possible to align the FC blocks
with each OFDM symbol, even in case of variable CP lengths. This reduces
complexity and latency, e.g., in mini-slot transmissions and, as an example,
allows to use 16-point transforms in case of a 12-subcarrier-wide subband
allocation, greatly reducing the implementation complexity. On the receiver
side, the proposed scheme makes it possible to effectively combine cascaded
inverse and forward FFT units in FC-filtered OFDM processing. Transform
decomposition is used to simplify these computations. Very extensive set of
numerical results is also provided, in terms of radio-link performance and
associated processing complexity.

game where the dynamic of estimation error is non-affine with respect to filter
gain and measurement noise. A nonquadratic Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI)

bounded noise, which is extremely difficult to solve due to its non-affine and
nonlinear properties. Next, a reinforcement learning algorithm based on

gain of reinforcement filter, where measurement noise is fixed to tackle
non-affine property and increase the convexity of Hamiltonian. Two examples

deuterium (D) within the nanostructure of an ultra-high strength steel with
high resistance to hydrogen embrittlement. Cold drawn, severely deformed
pearlitic steel wires (Fe-0.98C-0.31Mn-0.20Si-0.20Cr-0.01Cu-0.006P-0.007S wt.%,
{\epsilon}=3.1) contains cementite decomposed during the pre-deformation of the
alloy and ferrite. We find H and D within the decomposed cementite, and at some
interfaces with the surrounding ferrite. To ascertain the origin of the H/D
signal obtained in APT, we explored a series of experimental workflows
including cryogenic specimen preparation and cryogenic-vacuum transfer from the
preparation into a state-of-the-art atom probe. Our study points to the
critical role of the preparation, i.e. the possible saturation of H-trapping
sites during electrochemical polishing, how these can be alleviated by the use
of an outgassing treatment, cryogenic preparation and transfer prior to
charging. Accommodation of large amounts of H in the under-stoichiometric
carbide likely explains the resistance of pearlite against hydrogen
embrittlement.

malignant phenotype could be restricted to the early diagnosis of sub-types of
malignancies with the increased risk of existing therapy failure and high

understanding of malignant regulatory signatures is considered in this
contribution. Analyses from this perspective of experimental and clinical
observations revealed the pivotal role of human stem cell-associated retroviral
sequences (SCARS) in the origin and pathophysiology of clinically-lethal
malignancies. SCARS represent evolutionary- and biologically-related family of
genomic regulatory sequences, the principal physiological function of which is
to create and maintain the stemness phenotype during human preimplantation
embryogenesis. SCARS expression must be silenced during cellular
differentiation and SCARS activity remains silent in most
terminally-differentiated human cells performing specialized functions in the
human body. De-repression and sustained activation of SCARS result in
differentiation-defective phenotypes, tissue- and organ-specific clinical
manifestations of which are diagnosed as pathological conditions defined by a
consensus of pathomorphological, molecular, and genetic examinations as the
malignant growth. Contemporary evidence are presented that high-fidelity
molecular signals of continuing activities of SCARS in association with genomic
regulatory networks of thousands functionally-active enhancers triggering
engagements of down-stream genetic loci may serve as both reliable diagnostic
tools and druggable molecular targets readily amenable for diagnosis and
efficient therapeutic management of clinically-lethal malignancies.

indirect detection of dark matter with gamma rays due to their proximity, high
dark matter content and absence of non-thermal emission processes. Recently,
the Dark Energy Survey (DES) revealed the existence of new ultra-faint dwarf
spheroidal galaxies in the southern-hemisphere sky, therefore ideally located

gamma-ray emission using H.E.S.S. observations carried out recently towards
Reticulum II, Tucana II, Tucana III, Tucana IV and Grus II satellites. No
significant very-high-energy gamma-ray excess is found from the observations on
any individual object nor in the combined analysis of all the datasets. Using
the most recent modeling of the dark matter distribution in the dwarf galaxy
halo, we compute for the first time on DES satellites individual and combined
constraints from Cherenkov telescope observations on the annihilation cross
section of dark matter particles in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive
Particles. The combined 95% C.L. observed upper limits reach $\langle \sigma v

\times 10^{-26}$ cm$^3$s$^{-1}$ in the $\gamma\gamma$ channels for a dark
matter mass of 1.5 TeV. The H.E.S.S. constraints well complement the results
from Fermi-LAT, HAWC, MAGIC and VERITAS and are currently the most stringent in
the $\gamma\gamma$ channels in the multi-GeV/multi-TeV mass range.

interaction forces. However, free-floating objects do not have a fixed base to
absorb the reaction forces caused by the interactions. Consequently, if the
interaction forces are too high, objects can gain momentum and move away after
contact. This paper proposes an approach based on direct force control for
compliant manipulation of free-floating objects. The objective of the
controller is to minimize the interaction forces while maintaining the contact.
The proposed approach achieves this by maintaining small constant force along
the motion direction and an apparent reduction of manipulator inertia along
remaining Degrees of Freedom (DOF). Simulation results emphasize the importance
of relative inertia of the robotic manipulator with respect to the
free-floating object. The experiments were performed with KUKA LWR4+
manipulator arm and a two-dimensional micro-gravity emulator (object floating
on an air bed), which was developed in-house. It was verified that the proposed
control law is capable of controlling the interaction forces and aligning the
tools without pushing the object away. We conclude that direct force control
works better with a free-floating object than implicit force control
algorithms, such as impedance control.

implemented within a simulated swarm of 50 agents with varying proportions of

In this paper, we defend against adversarial attacks using neural architecture

weight-free operations, Gabor filters and convolutions. The resulting
anti-bandit NAS (ABanditNAS) incorporates a new operation evaluation measure
and search process based on the lower and upper confidence bounds (LCB and

we use UCB to abandon arms for search efficiency and LCB for a fair competition

other NAS methods, while achieving an $8.73\%$ improvement over prior arts on
CIFAR-10 under PGD-$7$.

such notions as projective and proper morphisms, finiteness of the cohomology,
vector and projective bundles, cohomology base change, semicontinuity theorems,
relative duality, Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity, flattening, Hilbert and Quot

particular, there is some overlap with a recent preprint by Moosavian and Zhou.
However, many techniques and constructions are presented here for the first
time, notably, a first development of Grothendieck relative duality for proper
morphisms of superschemes, the construction of the Hilbert superscheme in a
more general situation than the one already known (which in particular allows
one to treat the case of sub-superschemes of supergrassmannians), and a
rigorous construction of the Picard superscheme for a locally superprojective
morphism of noetherian superschemes with geometrically integral fibres.
Moreover, some of the proofs given here are new as well, even when restricted
to ordinary schemes. In a final section we construct a period map from an open
substack of the moduli of proper and smooth supercurves to the moduli stack of
principally polarized abelian superchemes.

interference should be taken into account to avoid biased estimates of the
treatment effect, but it can also be leveraged to save resources and provide
the intervention to a lower percentage of the population where the treatment is
more effective and where the effect can spill over to other susceptible
individuals. In fact, different people might respond differently not only to
the treatment received but also to the treatment received by their network

can help policy-makers in the scale-up phase of the intervention, it can guide
the design of targeting strategies with the ultimate goal of making the

propose a novel Deep Complementary Joint Model (DeepRS) for complex scene

augmentation data diversity. We take a pixel-wise discriminator to extract
alignment confidence maps which highlight aligned regions in weakly supervised

The outputs from segmentation model are utilized to implement deep-based region

for the mode-energies $E_k$, we study the dynamical fluctuations, computing the
moduli of the the energy-changes $|E_k(t)-E_k(0)|$. The main result is that
they follow Tsallis distributions, which relax to distributions close to
Maxwell-Boltzmann ones; indications are also given that the system remains
correlated. The relaxation time $\tau$ depends on specific energy
$\varepsilon$, and for the curve $\tau$ vs, $\varepsilon$ one has two results.
First, there exists an energy threshold $\varepsilon_0$, above which the curve
has the form $$
  \tau \cdot \varepsilon \simeq h\ , $$ where, unexpectedly, Planck's constant
$h$ shows up. In terms of the standard deviation $\Delta E$ of a mode-energy
(for which one has $\Delta E=\varepsilon$), denoting by $\Delta t$ the
relaxation time $\tau$, the relation reads $\Delta t \cdot \Delta E \simeq h$,
which reminds of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation. Moreover, the threshold
corresponds to zero-point energy. Indeed, the quantum value of the latter is
$h\nu/2$ ( where $\nu$ is the characterisic infrared frequency of the system),
while we find $\varepsilon \simeq h\nu/4$, so that one only has a discrepancy
of a factor 2. So it seems that lack of full chaoticity manifests itself, in

linguistic representation is learned together with the visual representation in

  Wheel",,,,,"cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We study the network localization problem, i.e., the problem of determining
node positions of a wireless sensor network modeled as a unit disk graph. In an
arbitrarily deployed network, positions of all nodes of the network may not be
uniquely determined. It is known that even if the network corresponds to a
unique solution, no polynomial-time algorithm can solve this problem in the
worst case, unless RP = NP. So we are interested in algorithms that efficiently
localize the network partially. A widely used technique that can efficiently
localize a uniquely localizable portion of the network is trilateration:
starting from three anchors (nodes with known positions), nodes having at least
three localized neighbors are sequentially localized. However, the performance
of trilateration can substantially differ for different choices of the initial
three anchors. In this paper, we propose a distributed localization scheme with
a theoretical characterization of nodes that are guaranteed to be localized. In
particular, our proposed distributed algorithm starts localization from a
strongly interior node and provided that the subgraph induced by the strongly
interior nodes is connected, it localizes all nodes of the network except some
boundary nodes and isolated weakly interior nodes.

analyses for KIC 04851217 and KIC 10686876. These systems are detached
eclipsing binaries hosting a pulsating component of delta Scuti type and have
been observed with the unprecedented accuracy of the Kepler space telescope.
Using ground based spectroscopic observations, the spectral types of the
primary components of the systems were estimated as A6V and A5V for KIC
04851217 and KIC 10686876, respectively, with an uncertainty of one subclass.
The present spectral classification together with literature radial velocities
curves were used to model the light curves of the systems and, therefore, to
calculate the absolute parameters of their components with higher certainty.
The photometric data were analysed using standard eclipsing binary modeling
techniques, while their residuals were further analysed using Fourier
transformation techniques in order to extract the pulsation frequencies of
their host delta Scuti stars. The oscillation modes of the independent
frequencies were identified using theoretical models of delta Scuti stars. The
distances of the systems were calculated using the relation between the
luminosity and the pulsation period for delta Scuti stars. The physical and the
oscillation properties of the pulsating components of these systems are
discussed and compared with others of the same type. Moreover, using all the
currently known cases of delta Scuti stars in detached binaries, updated
correlations between orbital and dominant pulsation periods and between log g
and pulsation periods were derived. It was found that the proximity of the
companion plays significant role to the evolution of the pulsational
frequencies.

structure of social networks. Applying a community detection algorithm results
in a division of a network into communities that is often used to inspect and

interpretation step of community structure is a crucial step in typical social

virtually all modern community detection methods are non-deterministic and
based on randomization and approximated results. This needs to be explicitly
taken into consideration when reasoning about community membership of
individual nodes. To do so, we propose a metric of community membership
consistency, that provides node-level insights in how reliable the placement of
that node into a community really is. In addition, it enables us to distinguish
the community core members of a community. The usefulness of the proposed
metrics is demonstrated on corporate board interlock networks, in which
weighted links represent shared senior level directors between firms. Results
suggest that the community structure of global business groups is centered
around persistent communities consisting of core countries tied by geographical
and cultural proximity. In addition, we identify fringe countries that appear
to associate with a number of different global business communities.

column density maps for the different species and used them to compute
abundance maps. The results of our observations were compared with Nautilus
astrochemical models. We detected continuum emission in a ring that extends
from 0.6 to 2.0 arcsec, peaking at 0.97 and with a strong azimuthal asymmetry.
The molecules observed show different spatial distributions, and the peaks of
the distributions are not correlated with the binding energy. Using H2CO and SO
lines, we derived a mean disk temperature of 39 K. We derived a gas-to-dust
ratio that ranges from 10 to 40. The comparison with Nautilus models favors a

with parameters that correspond to each of the parameters of GmFace in order to
transform the problem of GmFace parameter solving into a network optimization
problem of GmNet. The face modeling process can be described by the following
steps: (1) GmNet initialization; (2) feeding GmNet with face image(s); (3)
training GmNet until convergence; (4) drawing out the parameters of GmNet (as

has been fruitful for many areas of vision science. But this approach has
inherent limitations and may not be sufficient to explain at the most
fundamental level why and how we see. Energy is a prime mover in the evolution
and operation of all biological systems, including vision, and early
researchers in physiological optics and experimental psychology regarded vision
as an energy-driven process. Yet to date there has been little attempt to
analyze the fundamentals of vision in energetic terms. This paper is a
provisional attempt to sketch an account of the early stages of vision as an
energy-driven process. On this account, vision is a form of biological work in
which energy from the environment is absorbed and processed by neurobiological
systems in order to guide behaviour. Evidence from the evolution and
neurobiology of vision is presented in support of this approach. I conclude
that treating vision as an energy-driven process can contribute to our
understanding of its fundamental nature and operation.

extensive research for many years. With the diffusion of Deep Neural Networks,
Variational Autoencoders have gained lots of attention since they provide an
explicit model of the data distribution based on an encoder/decoder
architecture which is able to both generate images and encode them in a
low-dimensional subspace. However, the latent space is not easily interpretable
and the generation capabilities show some limitations since images typically
look blurry and lack details. In this paper, we propose the Introspective
Variational Classifier (IntroVAC), a model that learns interpretable latent
subspaces by exploiting information from an additional label and provides
improved image quality thanks to an adversarial training strategy.We show that
IntroVAC is able to learn meaningful directions in the latent space enabling
fine-grained manipulation of image attributes. We validate our approach on the

confirm the anisotropy of the dynamo tensor acting in accretion disks, allowing
to relate both the resistivity and mean-field dynamo to the disk turbulence.
Our new model recovers previous simulations applying a purely radial initial

evaluate the in-plane stress in situ directly, without knowing any material
constants. This method only requires measuring the speed of two angled shear
waves. It is based on a formula which is exact for incompressible solids, such
as soft gels or tissues, and is approximately true for compressible ""hard""

by either learning social spatial interactions represented by the positions of
a group of pedestrians, while ignoring their temporal coherence (\textit{i.e.}
dependencies between different long trajectories), or by understanding the
complicated scene layout (\textit{e.g.} scene segmentation) to ensure safe
navigation. However, unlike previous work that isolated the spatial
interaction, temporal coherence, and scene layout, this paper designs a new
mechanism, \textit{i.e.}, Dynamic and Static Context-aware Motion Predictor
(DSCMP), to integrates these rich information into the long-short-term-memory

interactions between agents by learning both their spatial positions and
temporal coherence, as well as understanding the contextual scene layout.(2)
Different from previous LSTM models that predict motions by propagating hidden
features frame by frame, limiting the capacity to learn correlations between
long trajectories, we carefully design a differentiable queue mechanism in
DSCMP, which is able to explicitly memorize and learn the correlations between
long trajectories. (3) DSCMP captures the context of scene by inferring latent
variable, which enables multimodal predictions with meaningful semantic scene
layout. Extensive experiments show that DSCMP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by large margins, such as 9.05\% and 7.62\% relative improvements on

  Our approach builds on the following key insight: every graph with large
pathwidth has large treewidth or contains a subdivision of a large complete
binary tree. Specifically, we show that every graph with pathwidth at least
$th+2$ has treewidth at least $t$ or contains a subdivision of a complete
binary tree of height $h+1$. The bound $th+2$ is best possible up to a
multiplicative constant. This result was motivated by, and implies (with
$c=2$), the following conjecture of Kawarabayashi and Rossman (SODA'18): there
exists a universal constant $c$ such that every graph with pathwidth
$\Omega(k^c)$ has treewidth at least $k$ or contains a subdivision of a
complete binary tree of height $k$.
  Our main technical algorithm takes a graph $G$ and some (not necessarily
optimal) tree decomposition of $G$ of width $t'$ in the input, and it computes
in polynomial time an integer $h$, a certificate that $G$ has pathwidth at
least $h$, and a path decomposition of $G$ of width at most $(t'+1)h+1$. The
certificate is closely related to (and implies) the existence of a subdivision
of a complete binary tree of height $h$. The approximation algorithm for
pathwidth is then obtained by combining this algorithm with the approximation
algorithm of Feige, Hajiaghayi, and Lee (STOC'05) for treewidth.

misinformation, particularly in digital information environments, and major
social media platforms recently publicized some of the countermeasures they are

misinformation and disinformation being produced, and the theoretical and
technological paradigm used to counter it. I argue that this approach is based
on a conception of misinformation as epistemic pollution that can only justify
a limited and potentially inadequate response , and that some of the measures
undertaken in practice outrun this. In fact, social networks manage ecological
and architectural conditions that influence discourse on their platforms in
ways that should motivate reconsideration of the justifications that ground
epistemic interventions to combat misinformation, and the types of intervention
that they warrant. The editorial role of platforms should not be framed solely
as the management of epistemic pollution, but instead as managing the epistemic
environment in which narratives and social epistemic processes take place.
There is an element of inevitable epistemic paternalism involved in this, and
exploration of the independent constraints on its justifiability can help
determine proper limits of its exercise in practice.

magnetic noise that is correlated between spatially separated ground-based

detecting correlated magnetic noise and separating it from a true SGWB signal.
A commonly discussed method for addressing correlated magnetic noise is
coherent subtraction in the raw data using Wiener filtering. The method
proposed here uses a parameterized model of the magnetometer-to-strain coupling
functions, along with measurements from local magnetometers, to estimate the
contribution of correlated noise to the traditional SGWB detection statistic.
We then use Bayesian model selection to distinguish between models that include
correlated magnetic noise and those with a SGWB. Realistic simulations are used
to show that this method prevents a false SGWB detection due to correlated
magnetic noise. We also demonstrate that it can be used for a detection of a
SGWB in the presence of strong correlated magnetic noise, albeit with reduced
significance compared to the case with no correlated noise. Finally, we discuss
the advantages of using a global three-detector network for both identifying
and characterizing correlated magnetic noise.

which more accurate information regarding server queue lengths degrades
performance due to herding and detrimental incast effects. Indeed, both in

both researchers and system designers resort to more straightforward solutions,

incorporating the existence of other dispatchers into the decision-making

the asymptotic measure and since the two measures are different, we focus on
the asymptotic measure and prove new lower bounds on the asymptotic competitive
ratio. The existing lower bounds prior to this work were much smaller than $3$

  We significantly improve the best known lower bounds on the asymptotic

important producers of F and they can set a plateau in F abundance below
[Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, though its existence for [Fe/H]<-1 has yet to be confimed by
extensive observations of halo stars. In order to reproduce the F abundance
increase in the discs at late times, instead, a contribution from lower mass
stars - single asymptotic giant branch stars and/or novae - is required. The
dichotomy between the thick and thin discs is more evident in the [F/O] vs.

time is introduced, basing on a holistic hamiltonian analysis of the minimal
action for the string. This leads to a structurally new form of the action
which is, however, equivalent to the known results since, under appropriate
limits, it interpolates between the minimal action (Nambu Goto type) where the
string metric is taken to be that induced by the embedding and the Polyakov
type of action where the world sheet metric components are independent fields.
The equivalence among different actions is established by a detailed study of
symmetries using constraint analysis. Various vexing issues in the existing
literature are clarified. The interpolating action mooted here is shown to
reveal the geometry of the string and may be useful in analyzing
nonrelativistic string coupled with curved background.

jointly carried by the activation permutations of the reflecting patterns and
the phases of the transmitted signals, leading to that DRM can work without any
channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter, RIS or receiver. In other
words, DRM can release the intricate and resource-consuming channel estimation

  Separation",,,,,"eess.AS cs.LG cs.SD","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Monaural Singing Voice Separation (MSVS) is a challenging task and has been
studied for decades. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are the current
state-of-the-art methods for MSVS. However, the existing DNNs are often
designed manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. In addition, the
network architectures are usually pre-defined, and not adapted to the training
data. To address these issues, we introduce a Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
method to the structure design of DNNs for MSVS. Specifically, we propose a new
multi-resolution Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework for MSVS namely
Multi-Resolution Pooling CNN (MRP-CNN), which uses various-size pooling
operators to extract multi-resolution features. Based on the NAS, we then
develop an evolving framework namely Evolving MRP-CNN (E-MRP-CNN), by
automatically searching the effective MRP-CNN structures using genetic
algorithms, optimized in terms of a single-objective considering only
separation performance, or multi-objective considering both the separation
performance and the model complexity. The multi-objective E-MRP-CNN gives a set
of Pareto-optimal solutions, each providing a trade-off between separation
performance and model complexity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on
the MIR-1K and DSD100 datasets are used to demonstrate the advantages of the
proposed framework over several recent baselines.

image, a transmission map, rain streaks, and atmosphere light. While advanced
models are proposed for image restoration (i.e., background image generation),
they regard rain streaks with the same properties as background rather than
transmission medium. As vapors (i.e., rain streaks accumulation or fog-like
rain) are conveyed in the transmission map to model the veiling effect, the
fusion of rain streaks and vapors do not naturally reflect the rain image
formation. In this work, we reformulate rain streaks as transmission medium
together with vapors to model rain imaging. We propose an encoder-decoder CNN
named as SNet to learn the transmission map of rain streaks. As rain streaks
appear with various shapes and directions, we use ShuffleNet units within SNet
to capture their anisotropic representations. As vapors are brought by rain
streaks, we propose a VNet containing spatial pyramid pooling (SSP) to predict
the transmission map of vapors in multi-scales based on that of rain streaks.
Meanwhile, we use an encoder CNN named ANet to estimate atmosphere light. The
SNet, VNet, and ANet are jointly trained to predict transmission maps and
atmosphere light for rain image restoration. Extensive experiments on the
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed visual model
to predict rain streaks and vapors. The proposed deraining method performs
favorably against state-of-the-art deraining approaches.

semimetals in $d = d_L + d_Q$ spatial dimensions that disperse linearly in
$d_L$ dimensions, and quadratically in the remaining $d_Q$ dimensions. When
subject to strong interactions, these systems are susceptible to
semimetal-insulator transitions concurrent with spontaneous symmetry breaking.
Such quantum critical points are described by effective field theories of
anisotropic nodal fermions coupled to dynamical order parameter fields. We
analyze the universal scaling in the physically relevant spatial dimensions,
generalizing to a large number $N_f$ of fermion flavors for analytic control.
Landau damping by gapless fermionic excitations gives rise to non-analytic
self-energy corrections to the bosonic order-parameter propagator that dominate
the long-wavelength behavior. We show that perturbative momentum shell RG leads
to non-universal, cutoff dependent results, as it does not correctly account
for this non-analytic structure. In turn, using a completely general soft
cutoff formulation, we demonstrate that the correct IR scaling of the dressed
bosonic propagator can be deduced by enforcing that results are independent of
the cutoff scheme. Using this soft cutoff approach, we compute the exact
critical exponents for anisotropic semi-Dirac fermions $(d_L=1$, $d_Q=1)$ to
leading order in $1/N_f$, and to all loop orders. Applying the same method to
relativistic Dirac fermions, we reproduce the critical exponents obtained by

recognition (FER) datasets due to subjective annotating process and different
collecting conditions. Recent works resort to adversarial mechanisms that learn
domain-invariant features to mitigate domain shift. However, most of these
works focus on holistic feature adaptation, and they ignore local features that
are more transferable across different datasets. Moreover, local features carry
more detailed and discriminative content for expression recognition, and thus
integrating local features may enable fine-grained adaptation. In this work, we
propose a novel Adversarial Graph Representation Adaptation (AGRA) framework
that unifies graph representation propagation with adversarial learning for
cross-domain holistic-local feature co-adaptation. To achieve this, we first
build a graph to correlate holistic and local regions within each domain and
another graph to correlate these regions across different domains. Then, we
learn the per-class statistical distribution of each domain and extract
holistic-local features from the input image to initialize the corresponding
graph nodes. Finally, we introduce two stacked graph convolution networks to
propagate holistic-local feature within each domain to explore their
interaction and across different domains for holistic-local feature
co-adaptation. In this way, the AGRA framework can adaptively learn
fine-grained domain-invariant features and thus facilitate cross-domain
expression recognition. We conduct extensive and fair experiments on several
popular benchmarks and show that the proposed AGRA framework achieves superior
performance over previous state-of-the-art methods.

real world distribution of assets return is usually asymmetric and
heavy-tailed, which is far from being a Gaussian distribution. The asymmetry
and the heavy-tailedness are characterized by the third and fourth central

technology in terms of transferable information density and information
security. For applications using physical layer security or mode division
multiplexing, the complex transmission matrix must be known. To measure the
transmission matrix, the individual modes of the multimode fiber are excited
sequentially at the input and a mode decomposition is performed at the output.
Mode decomposition is usually performed using digital holography, which
requires the provision of a reference wave and leads to high efforts. To
overcome these drawbacks, a neural network is proposed, which performs mode
decomposition with intensity-only camera recordings of the multimode fiber
facet. Due to the high computational complexity of the problem, this approach
was usually limited to a number of 6 modes. In this work, it could be shown for
the first time that by using a DenseNet with 121 layers it is possible to break
through the hurdle of 6 modes. The advancement is demonstrated by a mode
decomposition with 10 modes experimentally. The training process is based on
synthetic data. The proposed method is quantitatively compared to the
conventional approach with digital holography. In addition, it is shown that
the network can perform mode decomposition on a 55-mode fiber, which also
supports modes unknown to the neural network. The smart detection using a
DenseNet opens new ways for the application of multimode fibers in optical

interesting neutron star binaries, e.g., millisecond pulsars, intermediate-mass
binary pulsars, etc. It has been suggested that oxygen-neon white dwarfs (ONe
WDs) can increase their mass to the Chandrasekhar limit by multiple He-shell
flashes, leading to AIC events. However, the properties of He-shell flashes on
the surface of ONe WDs are still not well understood. In this article, we aim
to study He-shell flashes on the surface of ONe WDs in a systematic approach.
We investigated the long-term evolution of ONe WDs accreting He-rich material
with various constant mass-accretion rates by time-dependent calculations with
the stellar evolution code Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics
(MESA), in which the initial ONe WD masses range from 1.1 to 1.35 M . We found
that the mass-retention efficiency increases with the ONe WD mass and the
mass-accretion rate, whereas both the nova cycle duration and the ignition mass
decrease with the ONe WD mass and the mass-accretion rate. We also present the
nuclear products in different accretion scenarios. The results presented in
this article can be used in the future binary population synthesis studies of
AIC events.

hybrid improper ferroelectricity (HIF) provides a new pathway to couple
octahedral rotations, ferroelectricity, and magnetism in complex materials. To
enable technological applications, a HIF with a small coercive field is
desirable. We successfully grow Sr3Sn2O7 single crystals, and discover that
they exhibit the smallest electric coercive field at room temperature among all
known HIFs. Furthermore, we demonstate that a small external stress can
repeatedly erase and re-generate ferroelastic domains. In addition, using
in-plane piezo-response force microscopy, we characterize abundant charged and
neutral domain walls. The observed small electrical and mechanical coercive
field values are in accordance with the results of our first-principles
calculations on Sr3Sn2O7, which show low energy barriers for both 90{\deg} and
180{\deg} polarization switching compared to those in other experimentally
demonstrated HIFs. Our findings represent an advance towards the possible

access to low cost satellite imagery. The price for satellite images depends on
the sensor quality and revisit rate. This work proposes to bridge the gap
between image quality and the price by improving the image quality via
super-resolution (SR). Recently, a number of deep SR techniques have been
proposed to enhance satellite images. However, none of these methods utilize
the region-level context information, giving equal importance to each region in
the image. This, along with the fact that most state-of-the-art SR methods are
complex and cumbersome deep models, the time taken to process very large
satellite images can be impractically high. We, propose to handle this
challenge by designing an SR framework that analyzes the regional information
content on each patch of the low-resolution image and judiciously chooses to
use more computationally complex deep models to super-resolve more
structure-rich regions on the image, while using less resource-intensive
non-deep methods on non-salient regions. Through extensive experiments on a
large satellite image, we show substantial decrease in inference time while
achieving similar performance to that of existing deep SR methods over several
evaluation measures like PSNR, MSE and SSIM.

roAp stars, we collected 2.45 hr of high-resolution data of the well studied
roAp star $\alpha$ Cir in a previously unused instrument configuration. We
extracted radial velocity measurements using different rare earth elements, and
the core of H$_\alpha$, via the cross correlation method. We performed the same
analysis with a set of $\alpha$ Cir data collected with the High Accuracy
Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectrograph to provide a benchmark for
our SALT HRS test. We measured significant radial velocity variations in the
HRS data and show that our results are in excellent agreement between the two
data sets, with similar signal-to-noise ratio detections of the principal
pulsation mode. With the HRS data, we report the detection of a second mode,
showing the instrument is capable of detecting multiple and low-amplitude
signals in a short observing window. We concluded that SALT HRS is well-suited
for characterising pulsations in Ap stars, opening a new science window for the

for classes of theories or (by using general arguments) universally for all
theories. Few are exact and inviolable. I present a new set of methods and
sufficient conditions for deriving exact, rigorous, and sharp bounds on all
coefficients of hydrodynamic dispersion relations, including diffusivity and
the speed of sound. These general techniques combine analytic properties of
hydrodynamics and the theory of univalent (complex holomorphic and injective)
functions. Particular attention is devoted to bounds relating transport to
quantum chaos, which can be established through pole-skipping in theories with
holographic duals. Examples of such bounds are shown along with holographic
theories that can demonstrate the validity of the conditions involved. I also
discuss potential applications of univalence methods to bounds without relation
to chaos, such as for example the conformal bound on the speed of sound.

using various articulatory acquisition techniques (e.g. ultrasound tongue
imaging, lip video). Real-time MRI (rtMRI) of the vocal tract has not been used
before for this purpose. The advantage of MRI is that it has a high `relative'
spatial resolution: it can capture not only lingual, labial and jaw motion, but
also the velum and the pharyngeal region, which is typically not possible with
other techniques. In the current paper, we train various DNNs (fully connected,
convolutional and recurrent neural networks) for articulatory-to-speech
conversion, using rtMRI as input, in a speaker-specific way. We use two male
and two female speakers of the USC-TIMIT articulatory database, each of them
uttering 460 sentences. We evaluate the results with objective (Normalized MSE
and MCD) and subjective measures (perceptual test) and show that CNN-LSTM
networks are preferred which take multiple images as input, and achieve MCD
scores between 2.8-4.5 dB. In the experiments, we find that the predictions of
speaker `m1' are significantly weaker than other speakers. We show that this is
caused by the fact that 74% of the recordings of speaker `m1' are out of sync.

efficient remote memory reclaiming technique on remote peers, based on two
optimizations: (1) an activity-based victim selection scheme to allow the
least-active-chunk of data to be selected for serving the eviction requests and
(2) a migration protocol to move the least-active-chunk of data to
less-memory-pressured remote node. As a result, Valet can effectively reduce
the performance impact and migration overhead on local nodes. Our extensive
experiments on both NoSQL systems and Machine Learning (ML) workloads show that
Valet outperforms existing representative remote paging systems with up to 226X
throughput improvement and up to 98% latency decrease over conventional OS swap

numerical simulations have shown that these winds can take either the
traditional `hourglass' symmetry about the mid-plane, or a `slanted' symmetry
dominated by a mid-plane toroidal field of a single sign. The formation of this
slanted symmetry state has not previously been explained. We use radially local
1D vertical shearing box simulations to assess the importance of large-scale
MRI channel modes in influencing the formation and morphologies of these wind
solutions. We consider only Ohmic resistivity and explore the effect of
different magnetisations, with the mid-plane $\beta$ parameter ranging from
$10^5$ to $10^2$. We find that our magnetic winds go through three stages of
development: cyclic, transitive and steady, with the steady wind taking a
slanted symmetry profile similar to those observed in local and global
simulations. We show that the cycles are driven by periodic excitation of the
$n=2$ or $3$ MRI channel mode coupled with advective eviction, and that the
transition to the steady wind is caused by a much more slowly growing $n=1$
mode altering the wind structure. Saturation is achieved through a combination
of advective damping from the strong wind, and suppression of the instability
due to a strong toroidal field. A higher disc magnetisation leads to a greater
tendency towards, and more rapid settling into the slanted symmetry steady
wind, which may have important implications for mass and flux transport
processes in protoplanetary discs.

reverse mathematics of combinatorial principles.
  We also demonstrate how this framework leads to a new kind of analysis of the
logical strength of mathematical problems that refines both that of reverse
mathematics and that of computability-theoretic notions such as Weihrauch
reducibility, allowing for a kind of fine-structural comparison between
$\Pi^1_2$ principles that has both computability-theoretic and proof-theoretic
aspects, and can help us distinguish between these, for example by showing that
a certain use of a principle in a proof is ""purely proof-theoretic"", as opposed
to relying on its computability-theoretic strength.
  We give examples of this analysis to a number of principles at the level of
$\mathsf{B}\Sigma^0_2$, uncovering new differences between their logical
strengths.

sub-bands of the Non Subsample Shearlet Transform (NSST) and non-Gaussian
models are used for marginal modeling of the coefficients. Six different
schemes are proposed for modeling NSST coefficients based on the four types of
neighboring defined; moreover, Kullback Leibler Divergence(KLD) close form is
calculated in different situations for the two Gaussian Copula and non Gaussian
functions in order to investigate the similarities in the proposed retrieval
framework. The Jeffery divergence (JD) criterion, which is a symmetrical
version of KLD, is used for investigating similarities in the proposed
framework. We have implemented our experiments on four texture image retrieval
benchmark datasets, the results of which show the superiority of the proposed
framework over the existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the
retrieval time of the proposed framework is also analyzed in the two steps of
feature extraction and similarity matching, which also shows that the proposed

intersection to the pressure field and hydraulic resistance for given inlet and
outlet pressure values. In this analysis, the impact of intersecting length,
intersecting angle and fracture aperture on the fluid flow was studied. For
this purpose, two models with different topologies were established. The
Hele-Shaw simulation results for hydraulic resistance, pressure and velocity
agreed well with results obtained by solving the full Navier-Stokes equations
(NSE). The results indicated an approximately linear relationship between
intersection length and hydraulic resistance. Specifically, an increase in the
intersection length increases the flow rate and as a result, the pressure along
the intersection length decreases. The error associated with employing the
Hele-Shaw approximation in comparison with NSE is less than 2%. All
Investigations were performed in the Reynolds Number range of 1-10.

software engineering in the last decade. Many approaches have indeed been
proposed, which leverage test suites as a weak, but affordable, approximation
to program specifications. Although the literature regularly sets new records
on the number of benchmark bugs that can be fixed, several studies increasingly
raise concerns about the limitations and biases of state-of-the-art approaches.
For example, the correctness of generated patches has been questioned in a
number of studies, while other researchers pointed out that evaluation schemes
may be misleading with respect to the processing of fault localization results.
Nevertheless, there is little work addressing the efficiency of patch
generation, with regard to the practicality of program repair. In this paper,
we fill this gap in the literature, by providing an extensive review on the
efficiency of test suite based program repair. Our objective is to assess the
number of generated patch candidates, since this information is correlated to
(1) the strategy to traverse the search space efficiently in order to select
sensical repair attempts, (2) the strategy to minimize the test effort for
identifying a plausible patch, (3) as well as the strategy to prioritize the
generation of a correct patch. To that end, we perform a large-scale empirical
study on the efficiency, in terms of quantity of generated patch candidates of
the 16 open-source repair tools for Java programs. The experiments are
carefully conducted under the same fault localization configurations to limit
biases.

of 3648 triplets (probe, mate, nonmate) of 95 subjects, which differ by
synthetically inpainting a chosen facial characteristic like the nose, eyebrows
or mouth creating an inpainted nonmate. An explainable face matcher is tasked
with generating a network attention map which best explains which regions in a
probe image match with a mated image, and not with an inpainted nonmate for
each triplet. This provides ground truth for quantifying what image regions
contribute to face matching. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive benchmark
on this dataset comparing five state of the art methods for network attention
in face recognition on three facial matchers. This benchmark includes two new

Sampling for Explanation (DISE) which outperform the state of the art by a wide

energy differences between the low-energy excitations correctly, and eliminates
spurious charge transfer states that TDDFT with (semi)local approximations is
known to produce. Our study provides accurate reference results and highlights
the potential of the $GW$+BSE approach for the simulation of larger pigment

inconsistent choices of the source/target datasets and feature extractors. In
this work, we first analyze the performance effect caused by these inconsistent

published domain adaptation algorithms. We ensure that all these algorithms
adopt the same source datasets and feature extractors for fair CD-FER

adversarial learning to learn holistic domain-invariant features to mitigate
domain shifts. However, these algorithms ignore local features, which are more
transferable across different datasets and carry more detailed content for
fine-grained adaptation. To address these issues, we integrate graph
representation propagation with adversarial learning for cross-domain
holistic-local feature co-adaptation by developing a novel adversarial graph
representation adaptation (AGRA) framework. Specifically, it first builds two
graphs to correlate holistic and local regions within each domain and across
different domains, respectively. Then, it extracts holistic-local features from
the input image and uses learnable per-class statistical distributions to
initialize the corresponding graph nodes. Finally, two stacked graph
convolution networks (GCNs) are adopted to propagate holistic-local features
within each domain to explore their interaction and across different domains
for holistic-local feature co-adaptation. We conduct extensive and fair
evaluations on several popular benchmarks and show that the proposed AGRA

leads to an arithmetic effort that grows exponentially in the number of
parameters. This renders the multigrid method, which has a well understood
convergence theory, infeasible. A parameter-dependent representation, e.g., a
low-rank tensor format, can avoid this exponential dependence, but in these it
is unknown how to calculate the inverse directly within the representation. The
combination of these representations with the multigrid method requires a
parameter-dependent version of the classical multigrid theory and a
parameter-dependent representation of the linear system, the smoother, the
prolongation and the restriction. A derived parameter-dependent version of the
smoothing property, fulfilled by parameter-dependent versions of the Richardson
and Jacobi methods, together with the approximation property prove the
convergence of the multigrid method for arbitrary parameter-dependent
representations. For a model problem low-rank tensor formats represent the
parameter-dependent linear system, prolongation and restriction. The smoother,
a damped Jacobi method, is directly approximated in the low-rank tensor format
by using exponential sums. Proving the smoothing property for this
approximation guarantees the convergence of the parameter-dependent method.
Numerical experiments for the parameter-dependent model problem, with bounded
parameter value range, indicate a grid size independent convergence rate.

multi-fluids can be obtained from an action principle involving the explicit
use of lower dimensional matter spaces. More traditional strategies for
incorporating dissipation-like the famous Mueller-Israel-Stewart model-are
based on expansions away from equilibrium defined, in part, by the laws of
thermodynamics. The goal here is to build a formalism to facilitate comparison
of the action-based results with those based on the traditional approach. The
first step of the process is to use the action-based approach itself to
construct self-consistent notions of equilibrium. Next, first-order deviations
are developed directly on the matter spaces, which motivates the latter as the
natural arena for the underlying thermodynamics. Finally, we identify the
dissipation terms of the action-based model with first-order ""thermodynamical""
fluxes, on which the traditional models are built. The description is developed
in a general setting so that the formalism can be used to describe multi-fluid
systems, for which causal and stable models are not yet available. As an
illustration of the approach, a simple application of a single viscous fluid is
considered and, even though the expansion is halted at first order, we sketch
how a causal response can be implemented through Cattaneo-type equations.

  Approach for Autonomous Driving Validation","17 pages, 15 figures",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous driving systems validation remains one of the biggest challenges
car manufacturers must tackle in order to provide safe driverless cars. The
high complexity stems from several factors: the multiplicity of vehicles,
embedded systems, use cases, and the very high required level of reliability
for the driving system to be at least as safe as a human driver. In order to
circumvent these issues, large scale simulations reproducing this huge variety
of physical conditions are intensively used to test driverless cars. Therefore,
the validation step produces a massive amount of data, including many
time-indexed ones, to be processed. In this context, building a structure in
the feature space is mandatory to interpret the various scenarios. In this
work, we propose a new co-clustering approach adapted to high-dimensional time
series analysis, that extends the standard model-based co-clustering. The
FunCLBM model extends the recently proposed Functional Latent Block Model and
allows to create a dependency structure between row and column clusters. This
structured partition acts as a feature selection method, that provides several
clustering views of a dataset, while discriminating irrelevant features. In
this workflow, times series are projected onto a common interpolated
low-dimensional frequency space, which allows to optimize the projection basis.
In addition, FunCLBM refines the definition of each latent block by performing
block-wise dimension reduction and feature selection. We propose a SEM-Gibbs
algorithm to infer this model, as well as a dedicated criterion to select the
optimal nested partition. Experiments on both simulated and real-case Renault
datasets shows the effectiveness of the proposed tools and the adequacy to our
use case.

Numerically, a discrete linear chain composed of active Brownian particles is
considered, analytically, a continuous linear semiflexible polymer with active
velocities changing diffusively. The force-free nature of active monomers is
accounted for - no Stokeslet fluid flow induced by active forces - and higher
order hydrodynamic multipole moments are neglected. The nonequilibrium
character of the active process implies a dependence of the stationary-state
properties on HI via the polymer relaxation times. In particular, at moderate
activities, HI lead to a substantial shrinkage of flexible and semiflexible
polymers to an extent far beyond shrinkage of comparable free-draining
polymers; even flexible HI-polymers shrink, while active free-draining polymers
swell monotonically. Large activities imply a reswelling, however, to a less
extent than for non-HI polymers, caused by the shorter polymer relaxation times
due to hydrodynamic interactions. The polymer mean square displacement is
enhanced, and an activity-determined ballistic regime appears. Over a wide
range of time scales, flexible active polymers exhibit a hydrodynamically
governed subdiffusive regime, with an exponent significantly smaller than that
of the Rouse and Zimm models of passive polymers. Compared to simulations, the
approximate analytical approach predicts a weaker hydrodynamic effect.

compression is accelerated for fixed optical intensity by using phase-squeezed

statistics of the modulating light, while the diagonal part of the sample
density matrix reduces to a Poissonian distribution regardless of the type of

efforts in this area have made it clear that the efficiency of the retrieval
will be impacted significantly by the amount of the storage space allowed at

utilizing only a subset of the constraints in the relaxed entropic LP in a
systematic manner. Though the new upper bound and lower bound do not lead to a
more precise approximate characterization in general, they are significantly

investigated applying the quasi-linear approach for small P\'eclet numbers and
the spectral $\tau$ approach for large P\'eclet numbers. Compressibility of a
fluid flow reduces the turbulent diffusivity of the mean temperature field
similarly to that for particle number density and magnetic field. However,
expressions for the turbulent diffusion coefficient for the mean temperature
field in a compressible turbulence are different from those for the mean
particle number density and the mean magnetic field. Combined effect of
compressibility and inhomogeneity of turbulence causes an increase of the mean
temperature in the regions with more intense velocity fluctuations due to a
turbulent pumping. Formally, this effect is similar to a phenomenon of
compressible turbophoresis found previously [J. Plasma Phys. {\bf 84},
735840502 (2018)] for non-inertial particles or gaseous admixtures. Gradient of
the mean fluid pressure results in an additional turbulent pumping of the mean

particles and gaseous admixtures. Compressibility of a fluid flow also causes a
turbulent cooling of the surrounding fluid due to an additional sink term in
the equation for the mean temperature field. There is no analog of this effect

even in the presence of moderate resistivity. For that reason, it is often
invoked as the most relevant constraint to the dynamical evolution of plasmas
in complex systems, such as solar and stellar dynamos, photospheric flux
emergence, solar eruptions, and relaxation processes in laboratory plasmas.
However, such studies often indirectly imply that relative magnetic helicity in
a given spatial domain can be algebraically split into the helicity
contributions of the composing subvolumes, i.e., that it is an additive
quantity. A limited number of very specific applications have shown that this
is not the case. Progress in understanding the non-additivity of relative
magnetic helicity requires removal of restrictive assumptions in favour of a
general formalism that can be used both in theoretical investigations as well
as in numerical applications. We derive the analytical gauge-invariant
expression for the partition of relative magnetic helicity between contiguous
finite-volumes, without any assumptions on either the shape of the volumes and
interface, or the employed gauge. The non-additivity of relative magnetic
helicity in finite volumes is proven in the most general, gauge-invariant
formalism, and verified numerically. More restrictive assumptions are adopted
to derive known specific approximations, yielding a unified view of the
additivity issue. As an example, the case of a flux rope embedded in a
potential field shows that the non-additivity term in the partition equation
is, in general, non-negligible. The relative helicity partition formula can be
applied to numerical simulations to precisely quantify the effect of
non-additivity on global helicity budgets of complex physical processes.

be discussed up to order $Q^0$ with leading-order contribution starting at

pseudoscalar, vector and axial-vector current operators. Differences between
vector and axial-vector currents calculated via transfer-matrix inversion and
unitary transformation techniques are discussed. The importance of consistent
regularization is an additional point which is emphasized: lack of consistent
regularization of axial-vector current operators is shown to lead to a
violation of the chiral symmetry in the chiral limit at order $Q$. For this
reason, a hybrid approach at order $Q$, discussed in various publications, is
non-applicable. To respect the chiral symmetry the same regularization
procedure needs to be used in the construction of nuclear forces and current
operators. Although full expressions of consistently regularized current
operators are not yet available an isoscalar part of the electromagnetic charge
operator up to order $Q$ has a very simple form and can be easily regularized
in a consistent way. As an application, we review our recent high accuracy
calculation of the deuteron charge form factor with a quantified error

the precise description of the chemical potential $\mu$ and the attractive
interaction $a$. Then we apply the finite dimensional reduction method to

concentrated points and the Lagrange multiplier. Finally, we also prove the
nonexistence of multi-peak solutions for the Schr\""odinger-Newton system, which
is markedly different from the corresponding Schr\""odinger equation. The
nonlocal term results in this difference.

different degenerate rates along different directions at the critical point of
$P(x)$ and some complicated estimates involved by the nonlocal term. To our

covers the first leading orders to the well-known Heisenberg-Euler (HE) type in
a particular gauge of pure magnetic field. Prior to the problem of collision we
obtain dyonic solution for the considered NED theory in a conformally flat
spacetime which has both electric and magnetic fields with constant invariants.
Our sole finding is that null currents inevitably arise in the process of
collision of plane waves in the HE type NED theory.

The {\sc List $k$-Colouring} problem is to decide whether a graph $G=(V,E)$

$c$ such that $c(u)\in L(u)$ for every $u\in V$. Let $P_t$ be the path on $t$

We generalize their result to List $k$-Colouring for every $k\geq 1$. Our

functions on an open set of a plane or finite-dimensional Euclidean space is
one of the main objects of potential theory and its applications to the complex
analysis. For a class $H$ of functions on $O$, a measure $\omega$ on $O$ is a
balayage of a measure $\delta$ on $O$ with respect to this class $H$ if $\int_O
h\, d \delta\leq \int_O h\, d\omega$ for each $h\in H$. In our previous works
we used this concept to study envelopes relative to classes of subharmonic and
harmonic functions and apply them to describe zero sets of holomorphic
functions on $O$ with growth restrictions near the boundary of $O$. In this
article, we consider the complex plane $\mathbb C$ as $O$, and instead of the
classes of all (sub)harmonic functions on $\mathbb C$, we use only the classes
of harmonic polynomials of degree at most $p$, often together with the
logarithmic functions-kernels $z\mapsto \ln |w-z|$, $w\in \mathbb C$. Our
research has show that this case has both many similarities and features
compared to previous situations. The following issues are considered: the
sensitivity of balayage of measures to polar sets; the duality between balayage
of measures and their logarithmic potentials, together with a complete internal
description of such potentials; extension/prolongation of balayage with respect
to polynomials and logarithmic kernels to balayage with respect to subharmonic
functions of finite order $p$. The planned applications of these results to the
theory of entire and meromorphic functions of finite order are not discussed
here and will be presented later.

hole forms a remnant with finite temperature, finite mass, and zero local heat
capacity in the last stages of evolution, which can be regarded as an
elementary particle. Meanwhile, it undergoes one second-order phase transition
and two Hawking-Page-type phase transitions. The Gross-Perry-Yaffe phase
transition occurs for both large black hole configuration and small black hole
configuration. For $\beta_0<0$, the Gross-Perry-Yaffe phase transition occurs
only for large black hole configuration, and the temperature and heat capacity
of black hole remnant is finite, whereas its mass is zero. This indicates the
remnant is metastable and would be in the Hawking-Page-type phase transition
forever. Specifically, according to the viewpoint of corpuscular gravity, the
remnant can be interpreted as an additional metastable tiny black hole
configuration, which never appears in the original case and the positive

on an integral representation of the Lagrangian function that uses the first
integral of the equation of motion while the second one relies on a
generalization of the well known Noether's theorem and constructs the
Lagrangian directly from the equation of motion. As an application of the
integral representation of the Lagrangian function we first provide some useful
remarks for the Lagrangian of the modified Emden-type equation and then obtain
results for Lagrangian functions of (i) cubic-quintic Duffing oscillator, (ii)
Li\'{e}nard-type oscillator and (iii) Mathews-Lakshmanan oscillator. As with
the modified Emden-type equation these oscillators were found to be
characterized by nonstandard Lagrangians except that one could also assign a
standard Lagrangian to the Duffing oscillator. We used the second approach to
find indirect analytic (Lagrangian) representation for three velocity-dependent
equations for (iv) Abraham-Lorentz oscillator, (v) Lorentz oscillator and (vi)
Van der Pol oscillator. For each of the dynamical systems from (i)-(vi) we
calculated the result for Jacobi integral and thereby provided a method to

a feedback to stochastic switching of the ensemble's devices between on- and
off- states. A simplified continuous-time model showed that carefully tuned
nonlinear feedback results in a fast (super-) relaxation of the ensemble energy
consumption. Since both state information and control signals are discrete, the
actual TCL devices operation is space-time quantized, and this must be
considered for realistic TCL ensemble modelling. Here, assuming that states are
characterized by indoor temperature (quantifying comfort) and air conditioner
regime (on, off), we construct a discrete model based on the probabilistic
description of state transitions. We demonstrate that super-relaxation holds in
such a more realistic setting, and that while it is stable against randomness
in the stochastic matrix of the quantized model, it remains sensitive to the
time discretization scheme. Aiming to achieve a balance between
super-relaxation and customer's comfort, we analyze the dependence of
super-relaxation on details of the space-time quantization, and provide a
simple analytical criterion to avoid undesirable oscillations in consumption.

ramping up the testing numbers. While the RT-PCR kits are available in
sufficient quantity in several countries, others are facing challenges with
limited availability of testing kits and processing centers in remote areas.
This has motivated researchers to find alternate methods of testing which are
reliable, easily accessible and faster. Chest X-Ray is one of the modalities
that is gaining acceptance as a screening modality. Towards this direction, the
paper has two primary contributions. Firstly, we present the COVID-19
Multi-Task Network which is an automated end-to-end network for COVID-19
screening. The proposed network not only predicts whether the CXR has COVID-19
features present or not, it also performs semantic segmentation of the regions
of interest to make the model explainable. Secondly, with the help of medical
professionals, we manually annotate the lung regions of 9000 frontal chest
radiographs taken from ChestXray-14, CheXpert and a consolidated COVID-19
dataset. Further, 200 chest radiographs pertaining to COVID-19 patients are
also annotated for semantic segmentation. This database will be released to the

range of modern technologies. Direct nanoscale measurement of the

limited by a lack of suitable experimental techniques and data analysis tools.
Scanning electron diffraction has emerged as a powerful tool for obtaining
two-dimensional maps of strain components perpendicular to the incident
electron beam direction. Extension of this method to recover the full
three-dimensional strain tensor field has been restricted though by the absence
of a formal framework for tensor tomography using such data. Here, we show that
it is possible to reconstruct the full non-symmetric strain tensor field as the
solution to an ill-posed tensor tomography inverse problem. We then demonstrate
the properties of this tomography problem both analytically and
computationally, highlighting why incorporating precession to perform scanning
precession electron diffraction may be important. We establish a general
framework for non-symmetric tensor tomography and demonstrate computationally
its applicability for achieving strain tomography with scanning precession
electron diffraction data.

the input ground motion on structural responses is an important step in
implementing a performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) framework. Among
various sources of uncertainty, the variability in the input ground motions,
a.k.a. record-to-record, greatly affects the assessment results. The objective
of this paper is to quantify the uncertainty in structural response with hybrid
uncertainty sources. In this paper, multiple matrix completion methods are
proposed and applied on a case study structure. The matrix completion method is
a means to estimate the analyses results for the entire set of input parameters
by conducting analysis for only a small subset of analyses. The main
algorithmic contributions of our proposed method are twofold. First, we develop
a sampling technique for choosing a subset of representative simulations, which
allows improving the accuracy of the estimated response. An unsupervised
machine learning technique is used for this purpose. Next, the proposed matrix
completion method for uncertainty quantification is further refined by
incorporating a regression model that is trained on the available partial
simulations. The regression model improves the initial sampling as it provides
a rough estimation of the structural responses. Finally, the proposed algorithm
is applied to a multi-degree-of-freedom system, and the structural responses
(i.e., displacements and base shear) are estimated. Results show that the
proposed algorithm can effectively estimate the response from a full set of
nonlinear simulations by conducting analyses only on a small portion of the
set.

Page et al. (2014). They found that the preferences of the rich correlated

did not, except via a linkage with rich people's preferences. Their analysis
applied the tools of classical statistical inference, in particular logistic
regression. In this paper we analyze the Gilens dataset using the complementary
tools of Random Forest classifiers (RFs), from Machine Learning. We present two
primary findings, concerning respectively prediction and inference: (i) Holdout
test sets can be predicted with approximately 70% balanced accuracy by models
that consult only the preferences of rich people and a small number of powerful
interest groups, as well as policy area labels. These results include
retrodiction, where models trained on pre-1997 cases predicted ""future""
(post-1997) cases. The 20% gain in accuracy over baseline (chance), in this
detailed but noisy dataset, indicates the high importance of a few wealthy
players in U.S. policy outcomes, and aligns with a body of research indicating
that the U.S. government has significant plutocratic tendencies. (ii) The
feature selection methods of RF models identify especially salient subsets of
interest groups (economic players). These can be used to further investigate
the dynamics of governmental policy making, and also offer an example of the
potential value of RF feature selection methods for inference on datasets such

environmental data are some of the main tasks of geospatial statisticians.
These routine tasks are accomplished using multivariate geospatial models and
the cokriging technique. The latter requires the evaluation of the expensive
Gaussian log-likelihood function, which has impeded the adoption of
multivariate geospatial models for large multivariate spatial datasets.
However, this large-scale cokriging challenge provides a fertile ground for
supercomputing implementations for the geospatial statistics community as it is
paramount to scale computational capability to match the growth in
environmental data coming from the widespread use of different data collection
technologies. In this paper, we develop and deploy large-scale multivariate
spatial modeling and inference on parallel hardware architectures. To tackle
the increasing complexity in matrix operations and the massive concurrency in
parallel systems, we leverage low-rank matrix approximation techniques with
task-based programming models and schedule the asynchronous computational tasks
using a dynamic runtime system. The proposed framework provides both the dense
and the approximated computations of the Gaussian log-likelihood function. It
demonstrates accuracy robustness and performance scalability on a variety of
computer systems. Using both synthetic and real datasets, the low-rank matrix
approximation shows better performance compared to exact computation, while
preserving the application requirements in both parameter estimation and
prediction accuracy. We also propose a novel algorithm to assess the prediction
accuracy after the online parameter estimation. The algorithm quantifies
prediction performance and provides a benchmark for measuring the efficiency
and accuracy of several approximation techniques in multivariate spatial
modeling.
