the Higgs boson couplings with electroweak gauge bosons, $HVV$ and $HHVV\
(V=W^\pm,Z)$, as well as the trilinear Higgs self-coupling $HHH$. At very high
energies both single and double Higgs productions rely on the vector-boson
fusion (VBF) topology. The outgoing remnant particles have a strong tendency to
stay in the very forward region, leading to the configuration of the ""inclusive
process"" and making it difficult to isolate $ZZ$ fusion events from the $WW$
fusion. In the single Higgs channel, we perform a maximum likelihood analysis
on $HWW$ and $HZZ$ couplings using two categories: the inclusive Higgs
production and the 1-muon exclusive signal. In the double Higgs channel, we
consider the inclusive production and study the interplay of the trilinear
$HHH$ and the quartic $VVHH$ couplings, by utilizing kinematic information in
the invariant mass spectrum. We find that at a centre-of-mass energy of 10 TeV
(30 TeV) with an integrated luminosity of 10 ab$^{-1}$ (90 ab$^{-1}$), one may
reach a 95\% confidence level sensitivity of 0.073\% (0.023\%) for $WWH$
coupling, 0.61\% (0.21\%) for $ZZH$ coupling, 0.62\% (0.20\%) for $WWHH$
coupling, and 5.6\% (2.0\%) for $HHH$ coupling. For dim-6 operators
contributing to the processes, these sensitivities could probe the new physics

simultaneously optimizing a supervised segmentation and an unsupervised style

transition-to-turbulent regime diffusion flames. Flame-height measurements are
obtained by means of numerical and experimental studies in which three high
definition cameras were employed to take frontal, lateral and 45{\deg} angled
images simultaneously. The images were analysed using an image-processing
algorithm to determine the flame-height through indirect measurement. To locate
an overall chemical-flame-length, numerical simulations were conducted with the
unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes technique. The eddy-dissipation model
was also implemented to calculate chemical reaction rate. The experiments show
that this proposed correlation has an adjustment variation of luminous
flame-height for the laminar regime of 16.9%, which indicates that, without the
use of the intermittent buoyant flame-height correlation, it globally best
represents the flame-height in this regime. For the laminar and
transition-to-turbulence regime the adjustment variations are 5.54% compared to
the most accepted flame-height correlations, thus providing an acceptably good
fitting. The numerical results show that the proposed range for the
chemical-flame-length is located between the luminous and flickering flame zone
compared to the experimental flame images. These results agree with the
chemical length zone reported in the literature. Therefore, the correlation can
be used for laminar and transition-to-turbulent combustion regimes.

for various non-standard cosmologies including coupled dark energy, $f(R)$
gravity and combinations of $f(R)$ gravity with massive neutrinos as well as
for the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We first numerically determine the
field cluster mass functions at various redshifts in the range of $0\le z\le 1$
for each cosmology. Then, we compare the analytic formula developed in previous
works with the numerically obtained field cluster mass functions by adjusting
its drifting coefficient, $\beta$, at each redshift. It is found that the
analytic formula with the best-fit coefficient provides a good match to the
numerical results at all redshifts for all of the cosmologies. The empirically
determined redshift evolution of the drifting coefficient, $\beta(z)$, turns
out to significantly differ among different cosmologies. It is also shown that
even without using any prior information on the background cosmology the
drifting coefficient, $\beta(z)$, can discriminate with high statistical
significance the degenerate non-standard cosmologies not only from the
$\Lambda$CDM but also from one another. It is concluded that the evolution of
the departure from the Einstein-de Sitter state and spherically symmetric
collapse processes quantified by $\beta(z)$ is a powerful probe of gravity and
dark sector physics.

axion or hidden photon, leverage potential interactions with electromagnetic
fields, whereby the dark matter (of unknown mass) on rare occasion converts
into a single photon. Current dark matter searches operating at microwave
frequencies use a resonant cavity to coherently accumulate the field sourced by
the dark matter and a near standard quantum limited (SQL) linear amplifier to
read out the cavity signal. To further increase sensitivity to the dark matter
signal, sub-SQL detection techniques are required. Here we report the
development of a novel microwave photon counting technique and a new exclusion
limit on hidden photon dark matter. We operate a superconducting qubit to make
repeated quantum non-demolition measurements of cavity photons and apply a
hidden Markov model analysis to reduce the noise to 15.7 dB below the quantum
limit, with overall detector performance limited by a residual background of
real photons. With the present device, we perform a hidden photon search and
constrain the kinetic mixing angle to $\epsilon \leq 1.68 \times 10^{-15}$ in a
band around 6.011 GHz (24.86 $\mu$eV) with an integration time of 8.33 s. This
demonstrated noise reduction technique enables future dark matter searches to

describe a general model-free RL method for no-regret learning based on
repeated reconsideration of past behavior. We propose a model-free RL
algorithm, the AdvantageRegret-Matching Actor-Critic (ARMAC): rather than
saving past state-action data, ARMAC saves a buffer of past policies, replaying
through them to reconstruct hindsight assessments of past behavior. These
retrospective value estimates are used to predict conditional advantages which,
combined with regret matching, produces a new policy. In particular, ARMAC
learns from sampled trajectories in a centralized training setting, without
requiring the application of importance sampling commonly used in Monte Carlo
counterfactual regret (CFR) minimization; hence, it does not suffer from
excessive variance in large environments. In the single-agent setting, ARMAC
shows an interesting form of exploration by keeping past policies intact. In
the multiagent setting, ARMAC in self-play approaches Nash equilibria on some
partially-observable zero-sum benchmarks. We provide exploitability estimates

Points (IXPs), in which agents choose which facilities to join. Joining the
same facility as other agents you communicate with has benefits, but different
facilities have different costs for each agent. Thus, the players wish to join
the same facilities as their ""friends"", but this is balanced by them not
wanting to pay the cost of joining a facility. We first show that the Price of
Stability ($PoS$) of this game is at most 2, and more generally there always
exists an $\alpha$-approximate equilibrium with cost at most $\frac{2}{\alpha}$
of optimum. We then focus on how better stable solutions can be formed. If we
allow agents to pay their neighbors to prevent them from deviating (i.e., a
player $i$ voluntarily pays another player $j$ so that $j$ joins the same
facility), then we provide a payment scheme which stabilizes the solution with
minimum social cost $s^*$, i.e. PoS is 1. In our main technical result, we
consider how much a central coordinator would have to pay the players in order
to form good stable solutions. Let $\Delta$ denote the total amount of payments
needed to be paid to the players in order to stabilize $s^*$, i.e., these are
payments that a player would lose if they changed their strategy from the one
in $s^*$. We prove that there is a tradeoff between $\Delta$ and the Price of
Stability: $\frac{\Delta}{cost(s^*)} \le 1 - \frac{2}{5} PoS$. Thus when there
are no good stable solutions, only a small amount of extra payment is needed to
stabilize $s^*$; and when good stable solutions already exist (i.e., $PoS$ is
small), then we should be happy with those solutions instead. Finally, we
consider the computational complexity of finding the optimum solution $s^*$,
and design a polynomial time $O(\log n)$ approximation algorithm for this

strongly on the knowledge of the true sparsity parameter $s$. In this paper, we
present a novel fast procedure for estimation in the high dimensional linear

recovery and optimization we achieve both optimal statistical accuracy and fast
convergence. The main advantage of our procedure is that it is fully adaptive,
making it more practical than state of the art IHT methods. Our procedure
achieves optimal statistical accuracy faster than, for instance, classical
algorithms for the Lasso. Moreover, we establish sharp optimal results for both
estimation and support recovery. As a consequence, we present a new iterative
hard thresholding algorithm for high dimensional linear regression that is
scaled minimax optimal (achieves the estimation error of the oracle that knows
the sparsity pattern if possible), fast and adaptive.

or equivalently certifying a lower bound on its chromatic number. We give
formal evidence of average-case computational hardness for this problem in
sparse random regular graphs, showing optimality of a simple spectral
certificate. This evidence takes the form of a computationally-quiet planting:
we construct a distribution of d-regular graphs that has significantly smaller
chromatic number than a typical regular graph drawn uniformly at random, while
providing evidence that these two distributions are indistinguishable by a
large class of algorithms. We generalize our results to the more general
problem of certifying an upper bound on the maximum k-cut.
  This quiet planting is achieved by minimizing the effect of the planted
structure (e.g. colorings or cuts) on the graph spectrum. Specifically, the
planted structure corresponds exactly to eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix.
This avoids the pushout effect of random matrix theory, and delays the point at
which the planting becomes visible in the spectrum or local statistics. To
illustrate this further, we give similar results for a Gaussian analogue of
this problem: a quiet version of the spiked model, where we plant an eigenspace
rather than adding a generic low-rank perturbation.
  Our evidence for computational hardness of distinguishing two distributions
is based on three different heuristics: stability of belief propagation, the
local statistics hierarchy, and the low-degree likelihood ratio. Of independent
interest, our results include general-purpose bounds on the low-degree
likelihood ratio for multi-spiked matrix models, and an improved low-degree

  Learning",,,,,"cs.DC cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Pollux improves scheduling performance in deep learning (DL) clusters by
adaptively co-optimizing inter-dependent factors both at the per-job level and
at the cluster-wide level. Most existing schedulers expect users to specify the
number of resources for each job, often leading to inefficient resource use.
Some recent schedulers choose job resources for users, but do so without
awareness of how DL training can be re-optimized to better utilize the provided
resources.
  Pollux simultaneously considers both aspects. By monitoring the status of
each job during training, Pollux models how their goodput (a novel metric we
introduce that combines system throughput with statistical efficiency) would
change by adding or removing resources. Leveraging these information, Pollux
dynamically (re-)assigns resources to improve cluster-wide goodput, while
respecting fairness and continually optimizing each DL job to better utilize
those resources.
  In experiments with real DL jobs and with trace-driven simulations, Pollux
reduces average job completion times by 37-50% relative to state-of-the-art DL
schedulers, even when they are provided with ideal resource and training
configurations for every job. Pollux promotes fairness among DL jobs competing
for resources based on a more meaningful measure of useful job progress, and
reveals a new opportunity for reducing DL cost in cloud environments. Pollux is
implemented and publicly available as part of an open-source project at

dependence of halo properties and environment on neutrinos, finding these
quantities to be impacted by neutrino masses at the same level as assembly
bias. We find that the effect of neutrinos on spin and shape can be largely
attributed to the change in the cold dark matter $\sigma_8$ in neutrinos
simulations, which is not the case for concentration.

range of disciplines, e.g. astrophysics, geophysics, biology, mechanical
engineering and biomedical engineering. As a reliable way in practice,
especially for turbulent flows, regional flow information such as velocity and
its statistics, can be measured experimentally. Due to the poor fidelity or
other technical limitations, some information may not be resolved in a region
of interest. On the other hand, detailed flow features are described by the
governing equations, e.g. the Navier-Stokes equations for viscous fluid, and
can be resolved numerically, which is heavily dependent on the capability of
either computing resources or modelling. Alternatively, we address this problem
by employing the physics-informed deep learning, and treat the governing
equations as a parameterised constraint to recover the missing flow dynamics.
We demonstrate that with limited data, no matter from experiment or others, the
flow dynamics in the region where the required data is missing or not measured,
can be reconstructed with the parameterised governing equations. Meanwhile, a
richer dataset, with spatial distribution of the control parameter (e.g. eddy
viscosity of turbulence modellings), can be obtained. The method provided in
this paper may shed light on data-driven scale-adaptive turbulent structure
recovering and understanding of complex fluid physics, and can be extended to
other parameterised governing systems beyond fluid mechanics.

a Mesh Parameter map, which can jointly describe the 3D body mesh on the pixel
level. Through a body-center-guided sampling process, the body mesh parameters
of all people in the image are easily extracted from the Mesh Parameter map.
Equipped with such a fine-grained representation, our one-stage framework is
free of the complex multi-stage process and more robust to occlusion. Compared

Experiments on crowded/occluded datasets demonstrate the robustness under

roles in the study of quantum chaos and holographic duality because they help
characterize the structure of time-evolving Heisenberg operators. It is
particularly important to understand how these microscopically defined measures
of complexity are related to notions of complexity defined in terms of a dual
holographic geometry, such as complexity-volume (CV) duality. Here we study
partially entangled thermal states in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and
their dual description in terms of operators inserted in the interior of a
black hole in Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity. We compare a microscopic
definition of complexity in the SYK model known as K-complexity to calculations
using CV duality in JT gravity and find that both quantities show an
exponential-to-linear growth behavior. We also calculate the growth of operator
size under time evolution and find connections between size and complexity.
While the notion of operator size saturates at the scrambling time, our study
suggests that complexity, which is well defined in both quantum systems and
gravity theories, can serve as a useful measure of operator evolution at both
early and late times.

our understanding and predictive capabilities of the magnetosphere-ionosphere

concern, with the development of an advanced Conductance Model for Extreme

values. CMEE has been developed using nonlinear regression over a year's worth
of one-minute resolution output from assimilative maps, specifically including
times of extreme driving of the solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere system. The
model also includes provisions to enhance the conductance in the aurora using
additional adjustments to refine the auroral oval. CMEE has been incorporated
within the Ridley Ionosphere Model (RIM) of the Space Weather Modeling
Framework (SWMF) for usage in space weather simulations. This paper compares
performance of CMEE against the existing conductance model in RIM, through a
validation process for six space weather events. The performance analysis
indicates overall improvement in the ionospheric feedback to ground-based space

are reported. The spectra show nebular characteristics, revealing emission from
the progenitor star's metal-rich core and providing clues to the kinematics and
physical conditions of the explosion. The nebular spectra are dominated by
emission lines of [O I] $\lambda\lambda6300, 6364$ and [Ca II]
$\lambda\lambda7292, 7324$. Other notable, albeit weaker, emission lines
include Mg I] $\lambda4571$, [Fe II] $\lambda7155$, O I $\lambda7774$, Ca II
triplet, and a broad, boxy feature at the location of H$\alpha$. Unlike in
other stripped-envelope SNe, the [O I] doublet is clearly resolved due to the
presence of strong narrow components. The doublet shows an unprecedented
emission line profile consisting of at least three components for each [O
I]$\lambda6300, 6364$ line: a broad component (width $\sim2000$ km s$^{-1}$),
and a pair of narrow blue and red components (width $\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$)
mirrored against the rest velocity. The narrow component appears also in other
lines, and is conspicuous in [O I]. This indicates the presence of multiple
distinct kinematic components of material at low and high velocities. The
low-velocity components are likely to be produced by a dense, slow-moving
emitting region near the center, while the broad components are emitted over a
larger volume. These observations suggest an asymmetric explosion, supporting
the idea of two-component ejecta that influence the resulting late-time spectra
and light curves. SN 2016gkg thus presents striking evidence for significant
asymmetry in a standard-energy SN explosion. The presence of material at low
velocity, which is not predicted in 1D simulations, emphasizes the importance
of multi-dimensional explosion modeling of SNe.

manifested upon breaking time-reversal symmetry, where we measure energy gaps

factors $\nu=1,2,3$, respectively, consistent with flavour symmetry breaking in
the Hofstadter's butterfly spectrum of MATBG. Moreover, our concurrent

cooling are present. Simulations show that in steady state, thermal advection
from the hot phase balances radiative cooling. However, many features are
puzzling. For instance, hot gas entrainment appears to be numerically converged
despite the scale-free, fractal structure of such fronts being unresolved.
Additionally, the hot gas heat flux has a characteristic velocity $v_{\rm in}
\approx c_{\rm s,cold} (t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm sc,cold})^{-1/4}$ whose strength
and scaling are not intuitive. We revisit these issues in 1D and 3D
hydrodynamic simulations. We find that over-cooling only happens if numerical
diffusion dominates thermal transport; convergence is still possible even when
the Field length is unresolved. A deeper physical understanding of radiative
fronts can be obtained by exploiting parallels between mixing layers and
turbulent combustion, which has well-developed theory and abundant experimental
data. A key parameter is the Damk\""ohler number ${\rm Da} = \tau_{\rm
turb}/t_{\rm cool}$, the ratio of the outer eddy turnover time to the cooling
time. Once ${\rm Da} > 1$, the front fragments into a multiphase medium. Just
as for scalar mixing, the eddy turnover time sets the mixing rate, independent
of small scale diffusion. For this reason, thermal conduction often has limited
impact. We show that $v_{\rm in}$ and the effective emissivity can be
understood in detail by adapting combustion theory scalings. Mean density and
temperature profiles can also be reproduced remarkably well by mixing length
theory. These results have implications for the structure and survival of cold
gas in many settings, and resolution requirements for large scale galaxy
simulations.

to the formation of a hot central cavity. Inflowing gas is primarily cool,
rotational support dominates over turbulence and thermal pressure, and star

powers a bright accretion flare, and the theoretical modeling of such tidal
disruption events (TDEs) can provide a direct means of inferring SMBH
properties from observations. Previously it has been shown that TDEs with
$\beta = r_{\rm t}/r_{\rm p} = 1$, where $r_{\rm t}$ is the tidal disruption
radius and $r_{\rm p}$ is the pericenter distance of the star, form an in-plane
caustic, or ``pancake,'' where the tidally disrupted debris is compressed into
a one-dimensional line within the orbital plane of the star. Here we show that
this result applies generally to all TDEs for which the star is fully
disrupted, i.e., that satisfy $\beta \gtrsim 1$. We show that the location of
this caustic is always outside of the tidal disruption radius of the star and
the compression of the gas near the caustic is at most mildly supersonic, which
results in an adiabatic increase in the gas density above the tidal density of
the black hole. As such, this in-plane pancake revitalizes the influence of
self-gravity even for large $\beta$, in agreement with recent simulations. This
finding suggests that for all TDEs in which the star is fully disrupted,
self-gravity is revived post-pericenter, keeps the stream of debris narrowly
confined in its transverse directions, and renders the debris prone to
gravitational instability.

luminosity of SN Ia would not evolve with redshift. Recently, our age dating of
stellar populations in early-type host galaxies (ETGs) from high-quality
spectra has shown that this key assumption is most likely in error. It has been
argued though that the age-Hubble residual (HR) correlation from ETGs is not
confirmed from two independent age datasets measured from multi-band optical
photometry of host galaxies of all morphological types. Here we show, however,
that one of them is based on highly uncertain and inappropriate
luminosity-weighted ages derived, in many cases, under serious template
mismatch. The other dataset employs more reliable mass-weighted ages, but the
statistical analysis involved is affected by regression dilution bias, severely
underestimating both the slope and significance of the age-HR correlation.
Remarkably, when we apply regression analysis with a standard posterior
sampling method to this dataset comprising a large sample ($N=102$) of host
galaxies, very significant ($> 99.99 \%$) correlation is obtained between the
global population age and HR with the slope ($-0.047 \pm 0.011$~mag/Gyr) highly
consistent with our previous spectroscopic result from ETGs. For the local age
of the environment around the site of SN, a similarly significant ($> 99.96
\%$) correlation is obtained with a steeper slope ($-0.057 \pm 0.016$ mag/Gyr).
Therefore, the SN luminosity evolution is strongly supported by the age dating

which reconstruction is a convex problem but where the solution is also a
solution to the full nonlinear problem, a limit that bounds the effectiveness
of reconstruction. The linearized reconstruction results in similar cross
correlation coefficients with the linear input field as our full nonlinear
algorithm. The linearized reconstruction also produces similar cross
correlation coefficients to those of reconstruction attempts on cosmological
N-body simulations, which suggests that existing reconstruction algorithms are
extracting most of the accessible information. Our approach helps explain why
reconstruction algorithms accurately reproduce the initial conditions up to
some characteristic wavenumber, at which point there is a quick transition to
almost no correlation. This transition is set by the number of constraints on
reconstruction (the number of galaxies in the survey) and not by where shot
noise surpasses the clustering signal, as is traditionally thought. We further
show that on linear scales a mode can be reconstructed with precision well
below the shot noise expectation if the galaxy Lagrangian displacements can be
sufficiently constrained. We provide idealized examples of nonlinear
reconstruction where shot noise can be outperformed.

develop a knowledge gaps index -- a composite index to support the decision
makers across the Wikimedia movement by providing: a framework to encourage
structured and targeted brainstorming discussions; data on the state of the
knowledge gaps across the Wikimedia projects that can inform decision making
and assist with measuring the long term impact of large scale initiatives in
the Movement.
  After its first release in July 2020, the Research team has developed the
second complete draft of a taxonomy of knowledge gaps for the Wikimedia
projects, as the first step towards building the knowledge gap index. We
studied more than 250 references by scholars, researchers, practitioners,
community members and affiliates -- exposing evidence of knowledge gaps in
readership, contributorship, and content of Wikimedia projects. We elaborated
the findings and compiled the taxonomy of knowledge gaps in this paper, where
we describe, group and classify knowledge gaps into a structured framework. The
taxonomy that you will learn more about in the rest of this work will serve as
a basis to operationalize and quantify knowledge equity, one of the two 2030

high-dimensional multivariate data analysis. In this paper,we propose a novel
approach that builds upon tensor factorization tools. Any multivariate density
can be represented by its characteristic function, via the Fourier transform.
If the sought density is compactly supported, then its characteristic function
can be approximated, within controllable error, by a finite tensor of leading
Fourier coefficients, whose size de-pends on the smoothness of the underlying
density. This tensor can be naturally estimated from observed realizations of
the random vector of interest, via sample averaging. In order to circumvent the
curse of dimensionality, we introduce a low-rank model of this characteristic
tensor, which significantly improves the density estimate especially for
high-dimensional data and/or in the sample-starved regime. By virtue of
uniqueness of low-rank tensor decomposition, under certain conditions, our
method enables learning the true data-generating distribution. We demonstrate
the very promising performance of the proposed method using several measured
datasets.

thought to be the loudest gravitational wave (GW) siren, yet no confirmed BSBH
is known in the GW-dominated regime. While periodic quasars have been proposed
as BSBH candidates, the physical origin of the periodicity has been largely
uncertain. Here we report discovery of a periodicity (P=1607$\pm$7 days) at
99.95% significance (with a global p-value of ~$10^{-3}$ accounting for the
look elsewhere effect) in the optical light curves of a redshift 1.53 quasar,
SDSS J025214.67-002813.7. Combining archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey data with
new, sensitive imaging from the Dark Energy Survey, the total ~20-yr time
baseline spans ~4.6 cycles of the observed 4.4-yr (restframe 1.7-yr)
periodicity. The light curves are best fit by a bursty model predicted by
hydrodynamic simulations of circumbinary accretion disks. The periodicity is
likely caused by accretion rate modulation by a milli-parsec BSBH emitting GWs,
dynamically coupled to the circumbinary accretion disk. A bursty hydrodynamic
variability model is statistically preferred over a smooth, sinusoidal model
expected from relativistic Doppler boost, a kinematic effect proposed for
PG1302-102. Furthermore, the frequency dependence of the variability amplitudes
disfavors Doppler boost, lending independent support to the circumbinary
accretion variability hypothesis. Given our detection rate of one BSBH
candidate from circumbinary accretion variability out of 625 quasars, it
suggests that future large, sensitive synoptic surveys such as the Vera C.
Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time may be able to detect
hundreds to thousands of candidate BSBHs from circumbinary accretion with

heated or accelerated at the shock - with thermal synchrotron photons. We
estimate the properties of these neutrino burst FRB counterparts and find that
a fraction ~1e-8-1e-5 of the flare energy (or ~1e-4-0.1 of the radio isotropic

diverse origins. Their expected mass and spin distributions depend on the
specifics of the formation mechanisms. When a physically motivated prior
distribution is used in a Bayesian inference, the parameters estimated from the
gravitational-wave data can change significantly, potentially affecting the
physical interpretation of certain gravitational-wave events and their
implications on theoretical models. As a case study we analyze primordial black
holes, which might be formed in the early universe and could comprise at least
a fraction of the dark matter. If accretion is not efficient during their
cosmic history, primordial black holes are expected to be almost non-spinning.
If accretion is efficient, massive binaries tend to be symmetrical and highly
spinning. We show that incorporating these priors can significantly change the
inferred mass ratio and effective spin of some binary black hole events,
especially those identified as high-mass, asymmetrical, or spinning by a
standard analysis using agnostic priors. For several events, the Bayes factors
are only mildly affected by the new priors, implying that it is hard to
distinguish whether merger events detected so far are of primordial or
astrophysical origin. In particular, if binaries identified by LIGO/Virgo as
strongly asymmetrical (including GW190412) are of primordial origin, their mass
ratio inferred from the data can be closer to unity. For GW190412, the latter
property is strongly affected by the inclusion of higher harmonics in the

has attracted significant attention in recent years. The complexity of the task
arises from the commonly-adopted definition of an abnormal event, that is, a
rarely occurring event that typically depends on the surrounding context.
Following the standard formulation of abnormal event detection as outlier
detection, we propose a background-agnostic framework that learns from training
videos containing only normal events. Our framework is composed of an object
detector, a set of appearance and motion auto-encoders, and a set of
classifiers. Since our framework only looks at object detections, it can be
applied to different scenes, provided that normal events are defined
identically across scenes and that the single main factor of variation is the
background. To overcome the lack of abnormal data during training, we propose
an adversarial learning strategy for the auto-encoders. We create a
scene-agnostic set of out-of-domain pseudo-abnormal examples, which are
correctly reconstructed by the auto-encoders before applying gradient ascent on
the pseudo-abnormal examples. We further utilize the pseudo-abnormal examples
to serve as abnormal examples when training appearance-based and motion-based
binary classifiers to discriminate between normal and abnormal latent features
and reconstructions. We compare our framework with the state-of-the-art methods
on four benchmark data sets, using various evaluation metrics. Compared to
existing methods, the empirical results indicate that our approach achieves
favorable performance on all data sets. In addition, we provide region-based

sample has a unique 20-year long multi-color ($griz$) light curve enabled by
combining DES-SN Y6 observations with archival SDSS-S82 data. The deep imaging
allows us to search for periodic light curves in less luminous quasars (down to
$r{\sim}$23.5 mag) powered by less massive black holes (with masses
$\gtrsim10^{8.5}M_{\odot}$) at high redshift for the first time. We find five
candidates with significant (at $>$99.74% single-frequency significance in at
least two bands with a global p-value of
$\sim$7$\times10^{-4}$--3$\times10^{-3}$ accounting for the look-elsewhere
effect) periodicity with observed periods of $\sim$3--5 years (i.e., 1--2 years
in rest frame) having $\sim$4--6 cycles spanned by the observations. If all
five candidates are periodically variable quasars, this translates into a
detection rate of ${\sim}0.8^{+0.5}_{-0.3}$% or ${\sim}1.1^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$
quasar per deg$^2$. Our detection rate is 4--80 times larger than those found
by previous searches using shallower surveys over larger areas. This
discrepancy is likely caused by differences in the quasar populations probed
and the survey data qualities. We discuss implications on the future direct
detection of low-frequency gravitational waves. Continued photometric
monitoring will further assess the robustness and characteristics of these
candidate periodic quasars to determine their physical origins.

that are in some way unusual and do not fit the general patterns present in the
dataset. Numerous algorithms use discretization of numerical data in their
detection processes. This study investigates the effect of the discretization
method on the unsupervised detection of each of the six anomaly types
acknowledged in a recent typology of data anomalies. To this end, experiments
are conducted with various datasets and SECODA, a general-purpose algorithm for
unsupervised non-parametric anomaly detection in datasets with numerical and
categorical attributes. This algorithm employs discretization of continuous
attributes, exponentially increasing weights and discretization cut points, and
a pruning heuristic to detect anomalies with an optimal number of iterations.
The results demonstrate that standard SECODA can detect all six types, but that
different discretization methods favor the discovery of certain anomaly types.
The main findings also hold for other detection techniques using
discretization.

on energy-efficient on-board communication systems. In this context, the
integration of Reconfigurable Smart Surfaces (RSS) into aerial platforms is
envisioned as a key enabler of energy-efficient and cost-effective deployments
of aerial platforms. Indeed, RSS consist of low-cost reflectors capable of
smartly directing signals in a nearly passive way. We investigate in this paper
the link budget of RSS-assisted communications under the two discussed RSS
reflection paradigms in the literature, namely the specular and the scattering
reflection paradigm types. Specifically, we analyze the characteristics of
RSS-equipped aerial platforms and compare their communication performance with
that of RSS-assisted terrestrial networks, using standardized channel models.
In addition, we derive the optimal aerial platforms placements under both
reflection paradigms. The obtained results provide important insights for the
design of RSS-assisted communications. For instance, given that a HAPS has a
large RSS surface, it provides superior link budget performance in most studied
scenarios. In contrast, the limited RSS area on UAVs and the large propagation
loss in LEO satellite communications make them unfavorable candidates for
supporting terrestrial users. Finally, the optimal location of the RSS-equipped

key issue in order e.g. to inform health-care decisions on emergency
management. The compartmental and spatial models so far proposed use parametric
descriptions of the contact rate, often assuming a time-invariant effect of the
lockdown. In this paper we show that these assumptions may lead to erroneous
evaluations on the ongoing pandemic. Thus, we develop a new class of
nonparametric compartmental models able to describe how the impact of the
lockdown varies in time. Exploiting regularization theory, hospitalized data
are mapped into an infinite-dimensional space, hence obtaining a function which
takes into account also how social distancing measures and people's growing
awareness of infection's risk evolves as time progresses. This permits to
reconstruct a continuous-time profile of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number with a
resolution never reached before. When applied to data collected in Lombardy,
the most affected Italian region, our model illustrates how people behaviour
changed during the restrictions and its importance to contain the epidemic.
Results also indicate that, at the end of the lockdown, around 12% of people in
Lombardy and 5% in Italy was affected by SARS-CoV-2. Then, we discuss how the
situation evolved after the end of the lockdown showing that the reproduction
number is dangerously increasing in the last weeks due to holiday relax
especially in the younger population and increased migrants arrival, reaching
values larger than one on August 1, 2020. Since several countries still observe
a growing epidemic, including Italy, and all could be subject to a second wave
after the summer, the proposed reproduction number tracking methodology can be
of great help to health care authorities to prevent another SARS-CoV-2
diffusion or to assess the impact of lockdown restrictions to contain the

applications for classifying fashion apparel features from image data are

and enhance the consumer experience. Many notable schemes have been proposed to
classify fashion items, however, the majority of which focused upon classifying
basic-level categories, such as T-shirts, pants, skirts, shoes, bags, and so
forth. In contrast to most prior efforts, this paper aims to enable an in-depth
classification of fashion item attributes within the same category. Beginning
with a single dress, we seek to classify the type of dress hem, the hem length,
and the sleeve length. The proposed scheme is comprised of three major stages:
(a) localization of a target item from an input image using semantic
segmentation, (b) detection of human key points (e.g., point of shoulder) using
a pre-trained CNN and a bounding box, and (c) three phases to classify the
attributes using a combination of algorithmic approaches and deep neural
networks. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is
highly effective, with all categories having average precision of above 93.02%,
and outperforms existing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based schemes.

dynamic MR images are used to determine motion phases for PET reconstruction
and estimate phase-to-phase nonrigid motion fields able to capture complex

binning and motion fields are used for PET reconstruction to generate
motion-corrected PET images. The proposed method was evaluated on in vivo data
with irregular motion patterns. MR reconstructions accurately captured motion,
outperforming state-of-the-art dynamic MR reconstruction techniques. Evaluation
of PET reconstructions demonstrated the benefits of the proposed method over
standard methods in terms of motion artifact reduction. The proposed method can

matters worse, traditional observational methods such as in-person reporting is
dangerous because observers may risk infection. A better solution is to observe
activities through network cameras; this approach is scalable and observers can
stay in safe locations. This research team has created methods that can
discover thousands of network cameras worldwide, retrieve data from the
cameras, analyze the data, and report the sizes of crowds as different
countries issued and lifted restrictions (also called ''lockdown''). We
discover 11,140 network cameras that provide real-time data and we present the
results across 15 countries. We collect data from these cameras beginning April
2020 at approximately 0.5TB per week. After analyzing 10,424,459 images from

reveals that the residents in some countries exhibited more activity (judged by
numbers of people and vehicles) after the restrictions were lifted. In other
countries, the amounts of activities showed no obvious changes during the
restrictions and after the restrictions were lifted. The data further reveals
whether people stay ''social distancing'', at least 6 feet apart. This study
discerns whether social distancing is being followed in several types of

dissipation theorem, built with quasi-particle energies obtained from
perturbative COHSEX on top of Hartree-Fock (BSE@COHSEX@HF) yield very accurate
results for diatomic molecules close to their equilibrium distance. When
self-consistent COHSEX quasi-particle energies and orbitals are used to build

while BCSK-d has lower complexity, these schemes present a useful design

magnetosphere-ionosphere system. They can also accelerate particles
contributing to shock acceleration. However, it is still unclear how exactly
they form. Recent particle-in-cell simulations point out the important role of
electric field and Hall current in the formation process. To further examine
this, we use data from the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission to apply
case studies on two small (1000-2000 km) foreshock transient events that just
started to form. In event 1 where MMS were in a tetrahedral formation, we show
that the current density configuration, which determined the magnetic field
profile, was mainly driven by Hall currents generated by demagnetized foreshock
ions. The resulting time variation of the magnetic field induced electric field
that drove cold plasma moving outward with magnetic field lines. In event 2
where MMS were in a string-of-pearls formation, we analyze the evolution of
field and plasma parameters. We show that the magnetic flux and mass flux were
transported outward from the core resulting in the steepening of the boundary.
The steepened boundary, which trapped more foreshock ions and caused stronger
demagnetization of foreshock ions, nonlinearly further enhanced the Hall
current. Based on our observations, we propose a physical formation process
that the positive feedback of foreshock ions on the varying magnetic field
caused by the foreshock ion Hall current enables an instability and the growth
of the structure.

  This paper studies trace reconstruction in the \emph{smoothed analysis}

unresolved populations of numerous low-luminosity X-ray binary systems that
trace stellar mass distribution of the Milky Way. Many dedicated studies
carried out over the last decade suggest that a dominant contributor to GDXE is
a population of accreting white dwarfs (WDs). The question arises about
relative contribution of different subclasses of accreting WD population,
namely non-magnetic WD binaries, magnetic intermediate polars (IPs) and polars,
in different regions of the Galaxy: the Galactic center, bulge, and ridge.
Recent low-energy (E$<10$ keV) studies indicate that non-magnetic WD binaries,
in particular quiescent dwarf novae, provide a major contribution to the
diffuse hard X-ray emission of the Galactic bulge. From the other side,
previous high energy (E$>10$ keV) X-ray measurements of the bulge and ridge
imply a dominant population of magnetic CVs, in particular intermediate polars.
In this work we use side aperture of the NuSTAR to probe the diffuse continuum
of the inner $\sim1-3^{\circ}$ of the Galactic bulge, which allows us to
constrain possible mixture of soft and hard populations components of the
spectrum. We found that GDXE spectrum is well-described by a single-temperature
thermal plasma with $kT \approx 8$ keV, which supports that the bulge is
dominated by quiescent dwarf novae with no evidence of a significant
intermediate polar population in the hard X-ray band. We also compare this
result with previous NuSTAR measurements of the inner 10 pc and inner 100 pc of
the Galactic center.

translationally-invariant lattices with flat dispersion bands. The compact
breathers appear in such systems even in the linear approximation. If the
interactions are nonlinear, but comply with the flat-band symmetry, the compact
breather solutions exist, but can lose their stability for certain parameter
values. As benchmark nonlinear potentials, we use the $\beta$-FPU
(Fermi-Pasta-Ulam) and vibro-impact models. Loss of stability is numerically
observed to occur through either pitchfork or Hopf bifurcations. The loss of
stability can occur through two qualitatively different mechanisms -- through
internal instability in the basic lattice elements, or through interaction of
the compact breather with the linear passband of the lattice. The former
scenario is more typical for high-amplitude breathers, and the latter -- for
low amplitudes. For the high-amplitude case, insights into the nature of
compact-mode loss-of-stability are obtained by resorting to the limit of a
piecewise-linear system, where interactions are represented by conservative
impacts. This issue calls for detailed introspection into integrability of
piecewise-linear (impacting) systems and their relation to the smooth system.
An idea for a sensor based on the studied mechanisms is suggested.

two planets transiting a G-type star with $V$ = 6.9 in the Ursa Major Moving
Group ($\sim$400 Myr). With a precise age constraint from cluster membership,
TOI-1726 provides a great opportunity to test various obliquity excitation
scenarios that operate on different timescales. By modeling the
Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, we derived a sky-projected obliquity of
$-1^{+35}_{-32}~^{\circ}$. This result rules out a polar/retrograde orbit; and
is consistent with an aligned orbit for planet c. Considering the previously
reported, similarly prograde RM measurement of planet b and the transiting
nature of both planets, TOI-1726 tentatively conforms to the overall picture
that compact multi-transiting planetary systems tend to have coplanar, likely
aligned orbits. TOI-1726 is also a great atmospheric target for understanding
differential atmospheric loss of sub-Neptune planets (planet b 2.2 $R_\oplus$
and c 2.7 $R_\oplus$ both likely underwent photoevaporation). The coplanar
geometry points to a dynamically cold history of the system that simplifies any
future modeling of atmospheric escape.

market, we assume a non-additive distortion pricing functional and the
principle of equal priority of payments in default. Under these assumptions, we
derive a canonical allocation of premium and margin, with properties that merit
the name the natural allocation. The natural allocation gives non-negative
margins to all independent lines for default-free insurance but can exhibit
negative margins for low-risk lines under limited liability. We introduce novel
conditional expectation measures of relative risk within a portfolio and use
them to derive simple, intuitively appealing expressions for risk margins and
capital allocations. We give a unique capital allocation consistent with our

Network-Assisted Approach (NAA), which contains effective local detection and

analytics, which has witnessed a variety of application areas such as finance,
manufacturing, biology, healthcare. To select a prespecified-size principal
submatrix from a covariance matrix to maximize its largest eigenvalue for the
better interpretability purpose, SPCA advances the conventional PCA with both
feature selection and dimensionality reduction. This paper proposes two exact
mixed-integer SDPs (MISDPs) by exploiting the spectral decomposition of the
covariance matrix and the properties of the largest eigenvalues. We then
analyze the theoretical optimality gaps of their continuous relaxation values
and prove that they are stronger than that of the state-of-art one. We further
show that the continuous relaxations of two MISDPs can be recast as saddle
point problems without involving semi-definite cones, and thus can be
effectively solved by first-order methods such as the subgradient method. Since
off-the-shelf solvers, in general, have difficulty in solving MISDPs, we
approximate SPCA with arbitrary accuracy by a mixed-integer linear program
(MILP) of a similar size as MISDPs. To be more scalable, we also analyze greedy
and local search algorithms, prove their first-known approximation ratios, and
show that the approximation ratios are tight. Our numerical study demonstrates
that the continuous relaxation values of the proposed MISDPs are quite close to
optimality, the proposed MILP model can solve small and medium-size instances
to optimality, and the approximation algorithms work very well for all the
instances. Finally, we extend the analyses to Rank-one Sparse SVD (R1-SSVD)

The combined SN and quasar sample is consistent with the isotropy hypothesis.
The distribution of the dataset might impact the preferred direction from the

fully hydrogenated system is metallic, while in the low-coverage limit the
spectrum of single-layer MoS$_2$ includes spin-polarized partially filled
localized mid-gap states. These states arise from s-orbitals of H atoms which
make a tilted bond with the surface S atoms. The calculated absorption spectrum
of the system reveals standard excitonic peaks, which correspond to the bound
valence-band hole and conduction-band electron, as well as excitonic peaks that
involve the mid-gap charges. As in the case of pristine single-layer MoS$_2$,
binding energies of the excitons of the hydrogenated system are found to be
relatively large (few tens of meV), making their experimental detection facile
and suggesting hydrogenation as a knob for tuning the optical properties of
single-layer MoS$_2$. Importantly, we find hydrogenation to suppress visible
light photoluminescence, in agreement with experimental observations. As an
aside, we contrast the effects of hydrogen coverage to that of the next two

problem of low accuracy of single-shot networks. Our method, termed with
SSS-Net, detects targets based on the location of the object's center and the
distances between the center and the points on the silhouette sampling with
non-uniform angle intervals, thereby achieving abalanced sampling of lines in
mask generation. In addition, we propose a non-uniform polar template IoU based
on the contour template in polar coordinates. Experiments on both the Airbus

the popular idea of pretraining word vectors (a.k.a. word embedding) with a
large corpus from a general domain such as Wikipedia, we used a relatively
small collection of relevant tweets (i.e. random and sarcasm tweets in Hindi

environment, it is essential to have high accuracy position information. This
requires a mapping and localisation system that can adapt to changes over time.
A localisation approach based on a single-survey map will not be suitable for
long-term operation as it does not incorporate variations in the environment.
In this paper, we present new algorithms to maintain a featured-based map. A
map maintenance pipeline is proposed that can continuously update a map with
the most relevant features taking advantage of the changes in the surroundings.
Our pipeline detects and removes transient features based on their geometrical
relationships with the vehicle's pose. Newly identified features became part of
a new feature map and are assessed by the pipeline as candidates for the
localisation map. By purging out-of-date features and adding newly detected
features, we continually update the prior map to more accurately represent the
most recent environment. We have validated our approach using the USyd Campus
Dataset, which includes more than 18 months of data. The results presented
demonstrate that our maintenance pipeline produces a resilient map which can
provide sustained localisation performance over time.

considerable attention in many real-world applications such as link sign
prediction, node classification and node recommendation. The challenge lies in
how to adequately encode the complex topological information of the networks.
Recent studies mainly focus on preserving the first-order network topology
which indicates the closeness relationships of nodes. However, these methods
generally fail to capture the high-order topology which indicates the local
structures of nodes and serves as an essential characteristic of the network
topology. In addition, for the first-order topology, the additional value of
non-existent links is largely ignored. In this paper, we propose to learn more
representative node embeddings by simultaneously capturing the first-order and
high-order topology in signed directed networks. In particular, we reformulate
the representation learning problem on signed directed networks from a
variational auto-encoding perspective and further develop a decoupled
variational embedding (DVE) method. DVE leverages a specially designed
auto-encoder structure to capture both the first-order and high-order topology
of signed directed networks, and thus learns more representative node
embedding. Extensive experiments are conducted on three widely used real-world
datasets. Comprehensive results on both link sign prediction and node
recommendation task demonstrate the effectiveness of DVE. Qualitative results
and analysis are also given to provide a better understanding of DVE.

provided new opportunities to apply related methodologies to automated driving.
However, there are still challenges to achieve automated driving maneuvers in
dynamically changing environments. Supervised learning algorithms such as
imitation learning can generalize to new environments by training on a large
amount of labeled data, however, it can be often impractical or
cost-prohibitive to obtain sufficient data for each new environment. Although
reinforcement learning methods can mitigate this data-dependency issue by
training the agent in a trial-and-error way, they still need to re-train
policies from scratch when adapting to new environments. In this paper, we thus
propose a meta reinforcement learning (MRL) method to improve the agent's
generalization capabilities to make automated lane-changing maneuvers at
different traffic environments, which are formulated as different traffic
congestion levels. Specifically, we train the model at light to moderate
traffic densities and test it at a new heavy traffic density condition. We use
both collision rate and success rate to quantify the safety and effectiveness
of the proposed model. A benchmark model is developed based on a pretraining
method, which uses the same network structure and training tasks as our
proposed model for fair comparison. The simulation results shows that the
proposed method achieves an overall success rate up to 20% higher than the
benchmark model when it is generalized to the new environment of heavy traffic
density. The collision rate is also reduced by up to 18% than the benchmark
model. Finally, the proposed model shows more stable and efficient
generalization capabilities adapting to the new environment, and it can achieve
100% successful rate and 0% collision rate with only a few steps of gradient

work we develop two new methods for constructing adversarial perturbations,
both of which are motivated by minimizing human ability to detect changes
between the perturbed and source image. The first of these, the Edge-Aware
method, reduces the magnitude of perturbations permitted in smooth regions of
an image where changes are more easily detected. Our second method, the

captures human ability to distinguish differences in colors, thus reducing the

implemented simultaneously, resulting in image perturbations which account for
both human color perception and sensitivity to changes in homogeneous regions.
Because Edge-Aware and Color-Aware modifications exist for many image
perturbations techniques, we also focus on computation to demonstrate their
potential for use within more complex perturbation schemes. We empirically
demonstrate that the Color-Aware and Edge-Aware perturbations we consider

note. For construction of the nuisance models, we separately consider the use
of high dimensional sparse parametric models and general machine learning
methods. By deriving certain moment equations to calibrate the first order bias
of the nuisance models, we preserve a model double robustness property on high
dimensional ultra-sparse nuisance models. We also discuss and compare the
underlying assumption of our method with debiased LASSO (Van deGeer et al.,
2014). To implement the machine learning proposal, we design a full model
refitting procedure that allows the use of any blackbox conditional mean
estimation method in our framework. Under the machine learning setting, our
method is rate doubly robust in a similar sense as Chernozhukov et al. (2018a).

have been devoted to addressing this problem and achieved great progress, yet
counting the number of ground objects from remote sensing images is barely
studied. In this paper, we are interested in counting dense objects from remote
sensing images. Compared with object counting in a natural scene, this task is
challenging in the following factors: large scale variation, complex cluttered
background, and orientation arbitrariness. More importantly, the scarcity of
data severely limits the development of research in this field. To address
these issues, we first construct a large-scale object counting dataset with
remote sensing images, which contains four important geographic objects:
buildings, crowded ships in harbors, large-vehicles and small-vehicles in
parking lots. We then benchmark the dataset by designing a novel neural network
that can generate a density map of an input image. The proposed network
consists of three parts namely attention module, scale pyramid module and
deformable convolution module to attack the aforementioned challenging factors.
Extensive experiments are performed on the proposed dataset and one crowd

the superiority and effectiveness of our method compared with state-of-the-art

remains the best regularization, (iii) K-fold cross-validation is the best
practice and (iv) the $L_2$ is preferred to the $\bar \epsilon$-insensitive
in-sample loss. The forecasting gains of nonlinear techniques are associated

due to its application as an intuitive communication tool. However, previous
studies have shown low classification performance, therefore its use in
real-life is not feasible. In addition, no suitable method to analyze it has
been found. Recently, deep learning algorithms have been applied to this
paradigm. However, due to the small amount of data, the increase in
classification performance is limited. To tackle these issues, in this study,
we proposed an end-to-end framework using Siamese neural network encoder, which
learns the discriminant features by considering the distance between classes.
The imagined words (e.g., arriba (up), abajo (down), derecha (right), izquierda
(left), adelante (forward), and atr\'as (backward)) were classified using the
raw electroencephalography (EEG) signals. We obtained a 6-class classification
accuracy of 31.40% for imagined speech, which significantly outperformed other
methods. This was possible because the Siamese neural network, which increases
the distance between dissimilar samples while decreasing the distance between
similar samples, was used. In this regard, our method can learn discriminant
features from a small dataset. The proposed framework would help to increase
the classification performance of imagined speech for a small amount of data

localization of the FRB provided by ASKAP reveals that the burst originated in
the outskirts of a highly star-forming spiral in a galaxy pair at redshift
$z=0.2340(1)$. Radio observations show no evidence for a compact persistent
radio source associated with the FRB 191001 above a flux density of $15 \mu$Jy.

as an image-plane transient in a single 10 s snapshot with a flux density of
19.3 mJy in the low-time-resolution visibilities obtained simultaneously with

slowly varying radio emissions 8 hr before and 1 hr after the burst. We found
no variable radio emission on timescales ranging from 1 ms to 1.4 hr. We report
our upper limits and briefly review FRB progenitor theories in the literature

how the non-Hermitian skin effect enhances the robustness of the topological

studying the nonreciprocal quantum dynamics, which may stimulate more dynamical

to 6 different semantic categories. We classified 6 categories and 72 exemplars
according to visual stimuli using EEG signals. In order to achieve a high

and momentum rates, correlate with the luminosity of the active galactic
nucleus (AGN). This is well explained by the wind-driven outflow model, where a
fraction of the AGN luminosity drives the outflow. However, significant
departures from these correlations have been observed in a number of galaxies.
This may happen because AGN luminosity varies on a much shorter timescale
($\sim 10^4-10^5$~yr) than outflow properties do ($\sim 10^6$~yr). We
investigate the effect of AGN luminosity variations on outflow properties using
1D numerical simulations. This effect can explain the very weak outflow in PDS
456: if its nucleus is currently much brighter than the long-term average
luminosity, the outflow has not had time to react to this luminosity change.
Conversely, the outflow in Mrk 231 is consistent with being driven by an almost
continuous AGN, while IRAS F11119+3257 represents an intermediate case between
the two. Considering a population of AGN, we find that very low momentum
loading factors $\dot{p}_{\rm out} < L_{\rm AGN}/c$ should be seen in a
significant fraction of objects - up to $15\%$ depending on the properties of
AGN variability and galaxy gas fraction. The predicted distribution of loading
factors is consistent with the available observational data. We discuss how
this model might help constrain the duty cycles of AGN during the period of
outflow inflation, implications for multiphase and spatially distinct outflows,
and suggest ways of improving AGN prescriptions in numerical simulations.

of a user from items in their browsing history and later to recommend items to
the user from the same catalog. The users' behavior consists of two parts: the
sequence of items that they viewed without intervention (the organic part) and
the sequences of items recommended to them and their outcome (the bandit part).
In this paper, we propose Bayesian Latent Organic Bandit model (BLOB), a
probabilistic approach to combine the 'or-ganic' and 'bandit' signals in order
to improve the estimation of recommendation quality. The bandit signal is
valuable as it gives direct feedback of recommendation performance, but the
signal quality is very uneven, as it is highly concentrated on the
recommendations deemed optimal by the past version of the recom-mender system.
In contrast, the organic signal is typically strong and covers most items, but
is not always relevant to the recommendation task. In order to leverage the
organic signal to e ciently learn the bandit signal in a Bayesian model we
identify three fundamental types of distances, namely action-history,
action-action and history-history distances. We implement a scalable
approximation of the full model using variational auto-encoders and the local
re-paramerization trick. We show using extensive simulation studies that our
method out-performs or matches the value of both state-of-the-art organic-based
recommendation algorithms, and of bandit-based methods (both value and
policy-based) both in organic and bandit-rich environments.

self-similarity (NSS) property, when designing energy functionals. One such
contribution is nonlocal structure tensor total variation (NLSTV), which lies
at the core of this study. This paper is concerned with boosting the NLSTV
regularization term through the use of directional priors. More specifically,
NLSTV is leveraged so that, at each image point, it gains more sensitivity in
the direction that is presumed to have the minimum local variation. The actual
difficulty here is capturing this directional information from the corrupted
image. In this regard, we propose a method that employs anisotropic Gaussian
kernels to estimate directional features to be later used by our proposed
model. The experiments validate that our entire two-stage framework achieves
better results than the NLSTV model and two other competing local models, in
terms of visual and quantitative evaluation.

technologies called wireless charging-discharging lanes (WCDLs). As such, EVs
could provide better services to the grid, especially for balancing the
supply-demand, while bringing convenience for EV users, because no cables and
EV stops are needed. To enable this EV--WCDL energy exchange, a novel
decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) trading mechanism is proposed, in which EVs
directly negotiate with a WCDL to reach consensus on the energy price and
amounts to be traded. Those energy price and amounts are solutions of an
optimization problem aiming at optimizing private cost functions of EVs and
WCDL. The negotiation process between EVs and WCDL is secured by a
privacy-preserving consensus mechanism. Further, to assure successful trading
with desired energy price and amounts, an analytical and systematic method is
proposed to select cost function parameters by EVs and WCDL in a fully
decentralized manner. Simulations are then carried out to validate developed
theoretical results, which confirm the effectiveness and scalability of the

of applications from optical communications to astronomical calibration.
Despite of their significant merits, low energy efficiency and the lack of

to real-world applications. Here, by introducing active lasing medium into the
soliton microcomb, for the first time, we experimentally achieve the chiral
soliton with agile on-off switch and tunable dual-comb generation in a packaged
microresonator. It is found that such a microresonator enables a soliton
slingshot effect, the rapid soliton formation arising from the extra energy
accumulation induced by inter-modal couplings. Moreover, tuning the erbium gain
can generate versatile multi-soliton states, and extend the soliton operation
window to a remarkable range over 18 GHz detuning. Finally, the gain-assisted
chirality of counterpropagating soliton is demonstrated, which enables an
unprecedented fast on-off switching of soliton microcombs. The non-trivial

miniature optical frequency combs and brings the fast tunable soliton tools

we propose two methods. One is a new data augmentation method designed for the

part' of Plato's Theaetetus (147d-148b). The subject of this 'mathematical
part' is the irrationality, one of the most important topics in early Greek
mathematics. As of huge interest for mathematicians, historians of mathematics
as well as of philosophy, there had been an avalanche of studies about it. In
our work, we revisit this question, for we think something is missing: a global
analysis of Plato's text, from these three points of view simultaneously:
history, mathematics and philosophy. It is what we have undertook through a new
translation, a new interpretation of the mathematical lesson about irrational
magnitudes and a novel interpretation of the whole passage from these three
points of view. Our guideline is considering Plato's writings seriously, not as
some playful work. This simple rule is indeed surprisingly constraining, but it
allows us to get a rare direct glance inside pre-Euclidean mathematics, in
contradiction with the 'Main Standard Interpretation' prevailing in history of
mathematics as well as in history of philosophy. This study had been divided in
two parts for editorial reasons. In the present article, we propose an analysis
of the first part of this 'mathematical part', Theodorus' lesson. In the second
article (Brisson-Ofman (to appear)), we present the sequel of the lesson and a
philosophical interpretation of the 'mathematical part' within the framework of
the entire dialogue. Both articles form a whole. They are both aimed to an
audience without any particular mathematical background, and require only
elementary mathematical knowledge, essentially of high school-level. Some more
delicate points are nevertheless developed in the Appendices.

cyber-physical systems. Modularity reduces complexity and increases reuse of
behavior. In this paper we pose and answer the following question: how can we
identify independent `modules' within the structure of reactive control
architectures? To this end, we propose a graph-structured control architecture
we call a decision structure, and show how it generalises some reactive control
architectures which are popular in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and robotics,
specifically Teleo-Reactive programs (TRs), Decision Trees (DTs), Behavior
Trees (BTs) and Generalised Behavior Trees ($k$-BTs). Inspired by the
definition of a module in graph theory, we define modules in decision
structures and show how each decision structure possesses a canonical
decomposition into its modules. We can naturally characterise each of the BTs,
$k$-BTs, DTs and TRs by properties of their module decomposition. This allows
us to recognise which decision structures are equivalent to each of these
architectures in quadratic time. Our proposed concept of modules extends to
formal verification, under any verification scheme capable of verifying a
decision structure. Namely, we prove that a modification to a module within a
decision structure has no greater flow-on effects than a modification to an
individual action within that structure. This enables verification on modules
to be done locally and hierarchically, where structures can be verified and
then repeatedly locally modified, with modules replaced by modules while
preserving correctness. To illustrate the findings, we present an example of a
solar-powered drone controlled by a decision structure. We use a Linear
Temporal Logic-based verification scheme to verify the correctness of this
structure, and then show how one can modify modules while preserving its
correctness.

intersubband coupling to the external electric field. These findings confirm

Classical T Tauri stars (cTTs) are pre-main sequence stars
surrounded by an accretion disk. They host a strong magnetic field, and both
magnetospheric accretion and ejection processes develop as the young magnetic
star interacts with its disk. Studying this interaction is a major goal toward
understanding the properties of young stars and their evolution. Aims. The goal
of this study is to investigate the accretion process in the young stellar
system HQ Tau, an intermediate-mass T Tauri star (1.9 M$_{\odot}$). Methods.
The time variability of the system is investigated both photometrically, using
Kepler-K2 and complementary light curves, and from a high-resolution
spectropolarimetric time series obtained with ESPaDOnS at CFHT. Results. The
quasi-sinusoidal Kepler-K2 light curve exhibits a period of 2.424 d, which we
ascribe to the rotational period of the star. The radial velocity of the system
shows the same periodicity, as expected from the modulation of the photospheric
line profiles by surface spots. A similar period is found in the red wing of
several emission lines (e.g., HI, CaII, NaI), due to the appearance of inverse
P Cygni components, indicative of accretion funnel flows. Signatures of
outflows are also seen in the line profiles, some being periodic, others
transient. The polarimetric analysis indicates a complex, moderately strong
magnetic field which is possibly sufficient to truncate the inner disk close to
the corotation radius, r$_{cor}$ $\sim$3.5 R$_{\star}$. Additionally, we report
HQ Tau to be a spectroscopic binary candidate whose orbit remains to be
determined. Conclusions. The results of this study expand upon those previously
reported for low-mass T Tauri stars, as they indicate that the magnetospheric
accretion process may still operate in intermediate-mass pre-main sequence
stars, such as HQ Tau.

the AA regions of the moir\'e unit cell and exhibits phase windings of integer

reproducible mobility data in the alloys of the Fe-Ga system with a strong
composition dependence of the diffusion coefficients. Tracer- (59Fe) and
inter-diffusion are simultaneously measured in three couples Fe/Fe-16Ga,
Fe/Fe-24Ga and Fe-16Ga/Fe-24Ga at 1143 K. The results obtained for the couples
with different end-members are in an excellent agreement with each other for
the overlapping composition intervals. The influence of the molar volume on the
measured tracer- (59Fe) and inter-diffusion coefficients is evaluated. Using
thermodynamic calculations, the Ga tracer diffusion coefficient and the vacancy
wind factor are determined via the Darken-Manning relation for the composition
range of 0-24 at.% Ga. The results confirm the reliability of the
tracer-interdiffusion couple technique for producing highly accurate diffusion
data, in the present case for optimizing the mobility description of the bcc

is very useful for several data analysis problems, such as for deciding on the

have to limit expressiveness of the language because, in general, it is
undecidable whether a given program is correct regarding types. Another concern
that was not addressed so far is that, for logic programming languages such as
Prolog, it is impossible to distinguish between intended and unintended failure

  In this paper, we elaborate on and discuss the aforementioned issues. As an
alternative, we present a static type analysis which is based on plspec.
Instead of ensuring full type-safety, we aim to statically identify type errors

off the Earth's linear gravitational potential. The quantum time delays are
obtained by subtracting the classical returning time (CRT) from the Wigner
time, the dwell time and the redefined Larmor time respectively. Different from
the conventional definition, our Larmor time is defined by aligning the
magnetic field along the neutron propagation direction, and this definition
does give reasonable results for motions through a free region and a square
barrier. It is worth noting that in the zero magnetic field limit, the Larmor
time coincides well with the CRT, which is due to the special shape of linear
barrier, and may have some relevance to the weak equivalence principle. It is
also found that the classical forbidden region plays an essential role for the
dwell time $\tau_{_\mathrm{DW}}$ to match with the CRT, and the difference
between the dwell and the phase times, \ie, the self-interference time delay,
is barrier shape sensitive and clearly shows the peculiarity of the linear
barrier. All the time delays are on the order of sub-millisecond and exhibit
oscillating behaviors, signaling the self-interference of the scattering
neutron, and the oscillations become evident only when the de Broglie
wavelength $\lambda_k=2\pi/k$ is comparable to the characteristic length
$L_c=[2m^2g/\hbar^2]^{-1/3}$. If the time delay measurement is experimentally
realizable, it can probe the quantum nature for particle scattering off the

clinical terminologies in Electronic Health Records (EHRs), which is a
fundamental and crucial step for clinical research. To train a high-performance
model for CNER, it usually requires a large number of EHRs with high-quality
labels. However, labeling EHRs, especially Chinese EHRs, is time-consuming and
expensive. One effective solution to this is active learning, where a model
asks labelers to annotate data which the model is uncertain of. Conventional
active learning assumes a single labeler that always replies noiseless answers
to queried labels. However, in real settings, multiple labelers provide diverse
quality of annotation with varied costs and labelers with low overall
annotation quality can still assign correct labels for some specific instances.
In this paper, we propose a Cost-Quality Adaptive Active Learning (CQAAL)
approach for CNER in Chinese EHRs, which maintains a balance between the
annotation quality, labeling costs, and the informativeness of selected
instances. Specifically, CQAAL selects cost-effective instance-labeler pairs to
achieve better annotation quality with lower costs in an adaptive manner.
Computational results on the CCKS-2017 Task 2 benchmark dataset demonstrate the
superiority and effectiveness of the proposed CQAAL.

this issue by using a novel RI representation by imposing a probability

mainly sensitive to the line-of-sight velocity at the latter atmospheric

Fabry-P\'{e}rot interferometry via double-$\Lambda$ CPT of laser-cooled
$^{87}$Rb atoms. Due to the constructive interference of temporal spinwaves,
the transmission spectrum appears as a comb of equidistant peaks in frequency
domain and thus the central Ramsey fringe can be easily identified. From the
optical Bloch equations for our five-level double-$\Lambda$ system, the
transmission spectrum is analytically explained by the Fabry-P\'{e}rot
interferometry of temporal spinwaves. Due to small amplitude difference between
the two Land\'{e} factors, each peak splits into two when the external magnetic
field is not too weak. This peak splitting can be employed to measure an
unknown magnetic field without involving magneto-sensitive transitions.

channel is seen to be crucial in generating large quark branches in the $M(R)$

core at moderately low NS masses, $\sim 1M_{\odot}$, and provides the required
repulsion to preserve the star stability up to $\sim2.1M_{\odot}$. Furthermore,
we show that both the heaviest NS mass generated, $M_{\text{max}}$, and its

$R_{\text{max}}$ as the coupling increases. This behavior imprints a
considerable deviation from the purely hadronic matter equation of state in the

highly dispersive and degenerate valence bands, which lead to a maximum power
factor, 3.8 mWm-1K-2 at 300K. As Sb-5p has a small contribution to the bandgap
formation, the substitution of Bi on the Sb site does not cause significant
change to the electronic structure. Although the Seebeck coefficient increases
by Bi due to slight changes in the bandgap, electrical conductivity, and hence,
the power factor reduces to ~3 mW m-1K-2 at 300K (50% Bi). On the other side,
lattice thermal conductivity drops effectively to 5 from 20 W/m K as Bi
introduces a significant contribution in the acoustic phonon region and
intensify phonon scattering. Thus, ZT value is improved through
Bi-substitution, reaching 1.1 (50% Bi) at 1200 K from 0.45 (pure TaSbRu) only.

coupled to a reservoir, and predicts a linear decay in time. Although it arises
at relatively short times, the Fermi regime does not take hold in the earliest
stages of the quantum dynamics. The standard criterion in the literature for
the onset time of the Fermi regime is $t_F\sim1/\Delta\omega$, with
$\Delta\omega$ the frequency interval around the resonant transition frequency
$\omega_0$ of the system, over which the coupling to the reservoir does not
vary appreciably. In this work, this criterion is shown to be inappropriate in
general for broadband reservoirs, where the reservoir coupling spectrum takes
the form $R\left(\omega\right)\propto\omega^\eta$, and for which it is found
that for $\eta>1$, the onset time of the Fermi regime is given by
$t_F\propto\left(\omega_{\mathrm{X}}/\omega_0\right)^{\eta-1}\times1/\omega_0$
where $\omega_{\mathrm{X}}$ is the high-frequency cutoff of the reservoir.
Therefore, the onset of the Fermi regime can take place at times orders of
magnitude larger than those predicted by the standard criterion. This
phenomenon is shown to be related to the excitation of the off-resonant
frequencies of the reservoir at short times. For broadband reservoirs with
$\eta\leq1$, and for narrowband reservoirs, it is shown that the standard
criterion is correct. Our findings revisit the conditions of applicability of
Fermi's golden rule and improve our understanding of the dynamics of unstable

are well-suited to deal with low dimensional data distributions. However, they

passing motif; features of nodes are passed around their neighbors, aggregated
and transformed to produce better nodes' representations. Nevertheless, these
methods seldom use node transition probabilities, a measure that has been found
useful in exploring graphs. Furthermore, when the transition probabilities are
used, their transition direction is often improperly considered in the feature
aggregation step, resulting in an inefficient weighting scheme. In addition,
although a great number of GCNN models with increasing level of complexity have
been introduced, the GCNNs often suffer from over-fitting when being trained on
small graphs. Another issue of the GCNNs is over-smoothing, which tends to make
nodes' representations indistinguishable. This work presents a new method to
improve the message passing process based on node transition probabilities by
properly considering the transition direction, leading to a better weighting
scheme in nodes' features aggregation compared to the existing counterpart.
Moreover, we propose a novel regularization method termed DropNode to address
the over-fitting and over-smoothing issues simultaneously. DropNode randomly
discards part of a graph, thus it creates multiple deformed versions of the
graph, leading to data augmentation regularization effect. Additionally,
DropNode lessens the connectivity of the graph, mitigating the effect of
over-smoothing in deep GCNNs. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets

proposed methods in comparison with the state of the art.

Gravities (HSGRAs) and their underlining algebraic structures. We give a
concise review of HSGRAs followed by three chapters with original results. The
first chapter is dedicated to the study of the vacuum one-loop correction of
holographic HSGRAs in Anti-de Sitter space. We show that there is a remarkable
agreement between the $F$-energy of HSGRAs in the bulk and the predictions
coming from the dual CFTs in integer dimensions. We extend this result to
continuous dimension and show that vacuum one-loop corrections in HSGRA
reproduce the $F$-energy of the Wilson-Fisher CFT in $4-\epsilon$ dimension.
The second part of the thesis explores the quantum properties of Chiral Higher
Spin Gravity - a closed subsector of any other HSGRA in four dimensions. We
show that Chiral Theory is UV-finite at one-loop. Moreover, there is an
interesting relation between one-loop amplitudes in Chiral HSGRA and the
self-dual subsector of QCD. The last part of the thesis is devoted to algebraic
structures of HSGRAs. As an application, we construct a formal bosonic HSGRA in
$AdS_5$ in two different ways: by deforming the Joseph relations and by
deforming the quasi-conformal realization.

by using DFT, DFPT, and semi-classical Boltzmann transport theory. Our elastic
and phonons calculations show that the compound has good structural stability.
The electronic structure calculation discloses that it is an indirect bandgap
(0.63 eV by mBJ+SOC) semiconductor. Light band hole effective mass leads to
higher electrical conductivity along x-axis than that of along z-axis. On the
other side, the weak phonon scattering leads to high lattice thermal
conductivity ~10.5 W m-1K-1 at 300 K. Although the power factor (PF) is very
high along the x-axis (above 10 mW m-1K-2 at 300 K), such large kl dramatically
reduces ZT. The maximum values of in-plane and cross-plane ZT are ~1 (n-type),
0.8 (p-type) and 0.6 (n-type), (0.2 p-type) at 700 K, respectively. The present
study has revealed that this compound has strong potential in eco-friendly TE

of 0.5--10\,keV X-ray data collected in August 2016, the on-pulse and off-pulse

However, DRF performance is still not satisfying due to trade-offs between
fairness and performance regarding resource utilization. To address this

searches are approaching the neutrino floor, there has been a resurgence of
interest in detectors with sensitivity to nuclear recoil directions. A
large-scale directional detector is attractive in that it would have
sensitivity below the neutrino floor, be capable of unambiguously establishing
the galactic origin of a purported dark matter signal, and could serve a dual
purpose as a neutrino observatory. We present the first detailed analysis of a
1000 m$^3$-scale detector capable of measuring a directional nuclear recoil
signal at low energies. We propose a modular and multi-site observatory
consisting of time projection chambers (TPCs) filled with helium and SF$_6$ at
atmospheric pressure. Depending on the TPC readout technology, 10-20 helium
recoils above 6 keVr or only 3-4 recoils above 20 keVr would suffice to
distinguish a 10 GeV WIMP signal from the solar neutrino background.
High-resolution charge readout also enables powerful electron background
rejection capabilities well below 10 keV. We detail background and site
requirements at the 1000 m$^3$-scale, and identify materials that require
improved radiopurity. The final experiment, which we name CYGNUS-1000, will be
able to observe 10-40 neutrinos from the Sun, depending on the final energy
threshold. With the same exposure, the sensitivity to spin independent cross
sections will extend into presently unexplored sub-10 GeV parameter space. For
spin dependent interactions, already a 10 m$^3$-scale experiment could compete
with upcoming generation-two detectors, but CYGNUS-1000 would improve upon this
considerably. Larger volumes would bring sensitivity to neutrinos from an even
wider range of sources, including galactic supernovae, nuclear reactors, and
geological processes.

when combined with automorphy lifting results pioneered by Wiles in the number

method to access modularity of mod $p$ Galois representations in both reducible

actual representation, rather than just its semisimplification, arises from
reduction of the geometric representation attached to a cuspidal automorphic

application, we get a version of Serre's modularity conjecture for reducible,
odd representations $\bar{\rho}: \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})

applications ranging from condensed matter to string theory. The conformal
bootstrap studies conformal field theories using mathematical consistency
conditions and has seen great progress over the last decade. In this thesis we
present an implementation of analytic bootstrap methods for perturbative
conformal field theories in dimensions greater than two, which we achieve by
combining large spin perturbation theory with the Lorentzian inversion formula.
In the presence of a small expansion parameter, not necessarily the coupling
constant, we develop this into a systematic framework, applicable to a wide
range of theories. The first two chapters provide the necessary background and
a review of the analytic bootstrap. This is followed by a chapter which
describes the method in detail, taking the form of a practical guide to large
spin perturbation theory by means of a step-by-step implementation. The second
part of the thesis presents several explicit implementations of the framework,
taking examples from a number of well-studied conformal field theories. We show
how many literature results can be reproduced from a purely bootstrap
perspective and how a variety of new results can be derived.

Analysing dermatoscopic images plays an important role in the early detection
of MM and other pigmented skin lesions. Among different computer-based methods,
deep learning-based approaches and in particular convolutional neural networks
have shown excellent classification and segmentation performances for
dermatoscopic skin lesion images. These models can be trained end-to-end
without requiring any hand-crafted features. However, the effect of using
lesion segmentation information on classification performance has remained an
open question. In this study, we explicitly investigated the impact of using
skin lesion segmentation masks on the performance of dermatoscopic image
classification. To do this, first, we developed a baseline classifier as the
reference model without using any segmentation masks. Then, we used either
manually or automatically created segmentation masks in both training and test
phases in different scenarios and investigated the classification performances.
Evaluated on the ISIC 2017 challenge dataset which contained two binary
classification tasks (i.e. MM vs. all and seborrheic keratosis (SK) vs. all)
and based on the derived area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
scores, we observed four main outcomes. Our results show that 1) using
segmentation masks did not significantly improve the MM classification
performance in any scenario, 2) in one of the scenarios (using segmentation
masks for dilated cropping), SK classification performance was significantly
improved, 3) removing all background information by the segmentation masks
significantly degraded the overall classification performance, and 4) in case
of using the appropriate scenario (using segmentation for dilated cropping),
there is no significant difference of using manually or automatically created
segmentation masks.

capture the complexity of underwater fish habitats. To address this limitation,
we present DeepFish as a benchmark suite with a large-scale dataset to train

approximately 40 thousand images collected underwater from 20 \green{habitats

contained only classification labels. Thus, we collected point-level and
segmentation labels to have a more comprehensive fish analysis benchmark. These
labels enable models to learn to automatically monitor fish count, identify
their locations, and estimate their sizes. Our experiments provide an in-depth
analysis of the dataset characteristics, and the performance evaluation of
several state-of-the-art approaches based on our benchmark. Although models
pre-trained on ImageNet have successfully performed on this benchmark, there is
still room for improvement. Therefore, this benchmark serves as a testbed to
motivate further development in this challenging domain of underwater computer

the data are zero outside the observation interval. If we assume otherwise, the
threshold SNR is lowered significantly, but the price paid is unacceptable
bias. Among all known unbiased estimators, the maximum-likelihood estimator
(MLE) has the lowest threshold, but is computationally the most expensive. We
propose a new algorithm that carries out, when needed, (i) zero-padding, and
(ii) removal and re-estimation. These added steps result in a threshold SNR
that is lower than that of the MLE for the examples considered herein, viz.,
noisy signals containing sinusoids with random parameters and up to five
components. The maximum improvement in threshold was 10 dB for the two-sinusoid
case. The bias of the estimates is also either equal to or lower than MLE's.
Unlike the MLE, the proposed method is very much computationally feasible.

to control over magnetic order. A key prediction of this theory is that the
demagnetization efficiency is determined by the availability of unoccupied

of empty 3d minority states, exactly as predicted by the OISTR effect. We

theoretically and experimentally that the proposed concept can create a strong

the infrared wavelengths, which gives rise to optical features of significantly
enhanced emissivity at the broad infrared wavelengths of 1.4-14 um as well as
effectively suppressed emissivity in the visible region. The electrically
driven metamaterial devices are optically and thermally stable at temperature
up to ~800 K with electro-optical conversion efficiency reaching ~30%. We

epidemiological barriers consisting in stopping symptomatic people are likely

a scheme for containing an outbreak in a city that consists in adding an extra
firewall block between the outbreak and the rest of the city. We implement a
coupled compartment model with stochastic noise to simulate a localized
outbreak that is partially isolated and analyze its evolution with and without
firewall for different plausible model parameters. We explore how further
improvements could be achieved if the epidemic evolution would trigger policy
changes for the flux and/or lock-down in the different blocks. Our results show

from the warm molecular layer, with the line intensity peaking at increasing
disk heights, $z$, for increasing radial distances, $r$. Molecular emission is
vertically stratified, with CO observed at larger disk heights (aperture
$z/r\sim0.41-0.45$) compared to both CS and H$_2$CO, which are nearly cospatial
($z/r\sim0.21-0.28$). In the outer midplane, the line emission decreases due to
molecular freeze-out onto dust grains (freeze-out layer) by a factor of >100

which is possibly due to H$_2$CO formation on icy grains, followed by a
nonthermal release into the gas phase. The inferred [CH$_3$OH]/[H$_2$CO]

short duration radio flashes similar to fast radio bursts (FRBs). No emission

al. [New J. Phys. 22 023020, Feb 2020] using the PBE functional suggest that
elemental sulfur does not adopt the simple-cubic (SC) $Pm\bar{3}m$ phase at
high pressures, in disagreement with previous works on this system [Phys. Rev.
Lett. 83, 3049, Oct 1999]. We carry out an extensive set of calculations using
a variety of different XC-functionals, pseudopotentials and the all-electron
code ELK, and we are now able to show that even though under LDA and PW91 a
high-pressure simple-cubic phase does indeed become favourable at the static
lattice level, when zero-point energies (ZPEs) are included, the transition to
the simple-cubic phase is suppressed in every case, owing to the larger ZPE of
the SC phase. We reproduce these findings with pseudopotentials that explicitly
include deep core and semicore states, and show that even at these high
pressures, only the $n=3$ valence shell contributes to bonding in sulfur. We
further show that the $Pm\bar{3}m$ phase becomes even more unfavourable at
finite temperatures. We finally investigate whether anharmonic corrections to
the zero-point energies could make the $Pm\bar{3}m$ phase favourable, and find
that these corrections are several orders of magnitude smaller than the ZPEs
and are thus negligable. These results therefore confirm the original findings
of Whaley-Baldwin et. al.; that the high pressure transition sequence of sulfur
is $R\bar{3}m \rightarrow$ BCC, with no intervening SC phase.

(MCMC) calls for a joint celebration by MCMC practitioners and theoreticians.
For practitioners, it circumvents the thorny issue of deciding the burn-in
period or when to terminate an MCMC sampling process, and opens the door for
safe parallel implementation. For theoreticians, it provides a powerful tool to
establish elegant and easily estimable bounds on the exact error of an MCMC
approximation at any finite number of iterates. A serendipitous observation
about the bias-correcting term leads us to introduce naturally available
control variates into the L-lag coupling estimators. In turn, this extension
enhances the coupled gains of L-lag coupling, because it results in more
efficient unbiased estimators, as well as a better bound on the total variation
error of MCMC iterations, albeit the gains diminish as L increases.
Specifically, the new upper bound is theoretically guaranteed to never exceed
the one given previously. We also argue that L-lag coupling represents a
coupling for the future, breaking from the coupling-from-the-past type of
perfect sampling, by reducing the generally unachievable requirement of being
perfect to one of being unbiased, a worthwhile trade-off for ease of
implementation in most practical situations. The theoretical analysis is
supported by numerical experiments that show tighter bounds and a gain in
efficiency when control variates are introduced.

comparing results from a quantum master equation (QME) involving rates from
second-order perturbative treatment with respect to the excitonic coupling with
non-perturbative results from ``Hierarchical Equations of Motion'' (HEOM). By
formulating generic Liouville-space expressions for the rates, we can choose to
evaluate them either via HEOM propagations or by applying cumulant expansion.
The coupling of electronic transitions to bath modes is modeled either as
overdamped oscillators for description of thermal bath components or as
underdamped oscillators to account for intramolecular vibrations. Cases of
initial nonequilibrium and equilibrium vibrations are discussed. In case of
HEOM initial equilibration enters via a polaron transformation. Pointing out
the differences between the nonequilibrium and equilibrium approach in the
context of the projection operator formalism, we identify a further
description, where the transfer dynamics is driven only by fluctuations without
involvement of dissipation. Despite this approximation, also this approach can
yield meaningful results in certain parameter regimes. While for the chosen
model HEOM has no technical advantage for evaluation of the rate expressions
compared to cumulant expansion, there are situations where only evaluation with
HEOM is applicable. For instance, a separation of reference and interaction
Hamiltonian via a polaron transformation to account for the interplay between
Coulomb coupling and vibrational oscillations of the bath at the level of a
second-order treatment can be adjusted for a treatment with HEOM.

the boundary of the disk, the spatial volume of the disk, the cosmological
constant and the matter Hamiltonian. In this paper we specialize to first-order
metric variations from pure AdS to the conical defect spacetime, and the bulk
first law is derived following a coordinate based approach. The AdS/CFT
dictionary connects the area of the boundary of the disk to the differential
entropy in CFT$_2$, and assuming the `complexity=volume' conjecture, the volume
of the disk is considered to be dual to the complexity of a cutoff CFT. On the
CFT side we explicitly compute the differential entropy and holographic
complexity for the vacuum state and the excited state dual to conical AdS using
the kinematic space formalism. As a result, the boundary dual of the bulk first
law relates the first-order variations of differential entropy and complexity
to the variation of the scaling dimension of the excited state, which
corresponds to the matter Hamiltonian variation in the bulk. We also include
the variation of the central charge with associated chemical potential in the
boundary first law. Finally, we comment on the boundary dual of the first law
for the Wheeler-deWitt patch of AdS, and we propose an extension of our CFT

of metastable stages. These are macroscopically distinguishable and appear
stationary, except for the sudden and rapid changes, called quakes, which
induce the transitions from one stage to the next. This phenomenology is well
known in physics as ""physical aging"", but from the vantage point of RD the
evolution of a class of systems of physical, biological and cultural origin is
rooted in a hierarchically structured configuration space and can therefore be
analyzed by similar statistical tools. This colloquium paper strives to present
in a coherent fashion methods and ideas that have gradually evolved over time.
To this end, it first describes the differences and similarities between RD and
two widespread paradigms of complex dynamics, Self Organized Criticality and
Continuous Time Random Walks. It then outlines the Poissonian nature of records
events in white noise time series, and connects it to the statistics of quakes
in metastable hierarchical systems, arguing that the relaxation effects of
quakes can generally be described by power laws unrelated to criticality.
Several different applications of RD have been developed over the years. Some
of these are described, showinghe basic RD hypothesis, the log time homogeneity
of quake dynamics, can be empirically verified in a given context. The
discussion summarizes the paper and briefly mentions applications not discussed
in detail. Finally, the outlook points to possible improvements and to new
areas of research where RG could be of use.

(SOMDAGMM) supplemented with well-preserved input space topology for more
accurate network intrusion detection. The deep autoencoding Gaussian mixture
model comprises a compression network and an estimation network which is able
to perform unsupervised joint training. However, the code generated by the
autoencoder is inept at preserving the topology of the input space, which is
rooted in the bottleneck of the adopted deep structure. A self-organizing map
has been introduced to construct SOMDAGMM for addressing this issue. The
superiority of the proposed SOM-DAGMM is empirically demonstrated with
extensive experiments conducted upon two datasets. Experimental results show
that SOM-DAGMM outperforms state-of-the-art DAGMM on all tests, and achieves up
to 15.58% improvement in F1 score and with better stability.

trajectories, especially while traversing uneven terrain. The proposed
trajectory optimization framework is capable of generating dynamically stable

defined with contact locations, base motion or both, making the algorithm
suitable for multiple scenarios (e.g., presence of moving obstacles). The
planner uses a simplified momentum-based task space model for the robot
dynamics, allowing computation times that are fast enough for online
replanning.This fast planning capabilitiy also enables the quadruped to
accommodate for drift and environmental changes. The algorithm is tested on
simulation and a real robot across multiple scenarios, which includes uneven
terrain, stairs and moving obstacles. The results show that the planner is
capable of generating stable trajectories in the real robot even when a box of

has been quite unstable. We have predicted that in the case that a fraction of
the population above a certain threshold returns to the public space, the
negative tendency of the epidemic curve will revert. Such predictions were
based on modeling the reactivation of economic activity after lockdown by means
of an epidemiological model on a contact network of Mexico City derived from
mobile device co-localization. We evaluated the epidemic dynamics considering
the tally of active and recovered cases documented in the mexican government's
open database. Scenarios were modeled in which different percentages of the
population are reintegrated to the public space by scanning values ranging from
5% up to 50%. Null models were built by using data from the Jornada Nacional de
Sana Distancia (the Mexican model of elective lockdown) in which there was a
mobility reduction of 75% and no mandatory mobility restrictions. We found that
a new peak of cases in the epidemic curve was very likely for scenarios in
which more than 5% of the population rejoined the public space; The return of
more than 50% of the population synchronously will unleash a peak of a
magnitude similar to the one that was predicted with no mitigation strategies.
By evaluating the tendencies of the epidemic dynamics, the number of new cases
registered, new cases hospitalized, and new deaths, we consider that under this
scenario, reactivation following only elective measures may not be optimal.
Given the need to reactivate economic activities, we suggest to consider
alternative measures that allow to diminish the contacts among people returning
to the public space. We evaluated that by ""encapsulating"" reactivated workers
may allow a reactivation of a larger fraction of the population without
compromising the desired tendency in the epidemic curve.

four different tool overhang lengths with varying cutting speed and the depth
of cut. We then examine the resulting signals and tag them as either chatter or
chatter-free. The tagged signals are then used to train a classifier. The
classification methods include the most common algorithms: Support Vector

the most informative when training a classifier and testing on data from the

accuracy drops significantly when training and testing on two different
configurations with different structural eigenfrequencies. Thus, we conclude
that while these traditional features can be highly tuned to a certain process,
their transfer learning ability is limited. We also compare our results against
two other methods with rising popularity in the literature: Wavelet Packet

development that allows agents to learn in sparse settings by altering memories
to show them as successful even though they may not be. While, empirically, HER

a tool for providing data reliability and durability under the constant threat
of device failures. In such systems, an $[n, k]$ code over a finite field
$\mathbb{F}_q$ encodes $k$ message symbols into $n$ codeword symbols from
$\mathbb{F}_q$ which are then stored on $n$ different nodes in the system.
Recent work has shown that significant savings in storage space can be obtained
by tuning $n$ and $k$ to variations in device failure rates. Such a tuning
necessitates code conversion: the process of converting already encoded data
under an initial $[n^I, k^I]$ code to its equivalent under a final $[n^F, k^F]$
code. The default approach to conversion is to reencode data, which places
significant burden on system resources. Convertible codes are a recently
proposed class of codes for enabling resource-efficient conversions. Existing
work on convertible codes has focused on minimizing access cost, i.e., the
number of code symbols accessed during conversion. Bandwidth, which corresponds
to the amount of data read and transferred, is another important resource to
optimize.
  In this paper, we initiate the study on the fundamental limits on bandwidth
used during code conversion and present constructions for bandwidth-optimal
convertible codes. First, we model the code conversion problem using network
information flow graphs with variable capacity edges. Second, focusing on MDS
codes and an important parameter regime called the merge regime, we derive
tight lower bounds on the bandwidth cost of conversion. The derived bounds show
that bandwidth cost can be significantly reduced even in regimes where access
cost cannot be reduced as compared to the default approach. Third, we present a
new construction for MDS convertible codes which matches the proposed lower

offers one approach to guide a large swarm using a few shepherding agents

problems, the impact of noise on shepherding is not a well-studied problem. We
study two forms of noise. First, we evaluate noise in the sensorial information
received by the shepherd about the location of sheep. Second, we evaluate noise
in the ability of the sheepdog to influence sheep due to disturbance forces
occurring during actuation. We study both types of noise in this paper, and
investigate the performance of Str\""{o}mbom's approach under these actuation
and perception noises. To ensure that the parameterisation of the algorithm
creates a stable performance, we need to run a large number of simulations,
while increasing the number of random episodes until stability is achieved. We
then systematically study the impact of sensorial and actuation noise on
performance. Str\""{o}mbom's approach is found to be more sensitive to actuation
noise than perception noise. This implies that it is more important for the
shepherding agent to influence the sheep more accurately by reducing actuation
noise than attempting to reduce noise in its sensors. Moreover, different
levels of noise required different parameterisation for the shepherding agent,
where the threshold needed by an agent to decide whether or not to collect
astray sheep is different for different noise levels.

a method that, given only sparse 2D supervision at training time, can, at test

establishing meaningful dense correspondences between object instances. It also

method to efficiently learn the parameters of resonant interactions for quantum
computers consisting of frequency-tunable superconducting qubits. Such
interactions include, for example, those to other qubits, resonators, two-level

improved swap spectroscopy calibration and consists of an offline data
collection algorithm, followed by an online Bayesian learning algorithm. The
purpose of the offline algorithm is to detect and roughly estimate resonant
interactions from a state of zero knowledge. It produces a square-root
reduction in the number of measurements. The online algorithm subsequently
refines the estimate of the parameters to comparable accuracy as traditional
swap spectroscopy calibration, but in constant time. We perform an experiment
implementing our technique with a superconducting qubit. By combining both
algorithms, we observe a reduction of the calibration time by one order of
magnitude. We believe the method investigated will improve present medium-scale

Finally, the two algorithms presented here can be readily adopted by
communities working on different physical implementations of quantum computing

perfectly captured by a simple model of Rabi oscillations of an ensemble of

relativity in the low frequency regime. The central concept of the detection of
GWs with PTA lies in measuring the time of arrival difference of the pulsar
signal due to the passing of GWs i.e. the pulses get red-shifted. In this paper
we provide a complete derivation of the redshift computation for all six
possible polarizations of GW which arise due to the modifcations to general

the critical point, where the GW source lies directly behind the pulsar. From
our mathematical discussion we conclude that the redshift has to be split
differently into polarization part (pattern functions) and interference part,
to avoid discontinuities and singularities in the pattern functions. This
choice of pattern functions agrees with the formula one uses for
interferometers with a single detector arm. Finally, we provide a general
expression which can in principle be used for pulsars and GW of any frequency

dose reduction, metal artifacts removal, tissue quantification and material
discrimination. The x-ray energy spectrum is divided into several bins, each
energy-bin-specific projection has a low signal-noise-ratio (SNR) than the
current-integrating counterpart, which makes image reconstruction a unique
challenge. Traditional wisdom is to use prior knowledge based iterative
methods. However, this kind of methods demands a great computational cost.
Inspired by deep learning, here we first develop a deep learning based
reconstruction method; i.e., U-net with L_p^p-norm, Total variation, Residual
learning, and Anisotropic adaption (ULTRA). Specifically, we emphasize the
Various Multi-scale Feature Fusion and Multichannel Filtering Enhancement with
a denser connection encoding architecture for residual learning and feature
fusion. To address the image deblurring problem associated with the
$L_2^2$-loss, we propose a general $L_p^p$-loss, $p>0$ Furthermore, the images
from different energy bins share similar structures of the same object, the
regularization characterizing correlations of different energy bins is
incorporated into the $L_p^p$-loss function, which helps unify the deep
learning based methods with traditional compressed sensing based methods.
Finally, the anisotropically weighted total variation is employed to
characterize the sparsity in the spatial-spectral domain to regularize the
proposed network. In particular, we validate our ULTRA networks on three
large-scale spectral CT datasets, and obtain excellent results relative to the

lamped-capacitance thermal circuit network model that is effective for speeding
up the thermal design optimization of an electronic circuit board layout with
transient heating chips. As electronic devices have become smaller and more
complex, the importance of thermal design optimization to ensure heat
dissipation performance has increased. However, such thermal design
optimization is difficult because it is necessary to consider various
trade-offs associated with packaging and transient temperature changes of
heat-generating components. This study aims to improve the performance of
thermal design optimization by artificial intelligence. BO using a Gaussian
process was combined with the lamped-capacitance thermal circuit network model,
and its performance was verified by case studies. As a result, BO successfully
found the ideal circuit board layout as well as particle swarm optimization
(PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA) could. The CPU time for BO was 1/5 and 1/4 of
that for PSO and GA, respectively. In addition, BO found a non-intuitive
optimal solution in approximately 7 minutes from 10 million layout patterns. It
was estimated that this was 1/1000 of the CPU time required for analyzing all
layout patterns.

investigate how network structure differs across sub-populations based on
students' sex, ethnicity, and the socio-economic-status (SES) of the high
school they attended. Results show the structure of the STEM co-enrolment
network differs across these sub-populations, and also changes over time. We
find that, while female students were more likely to have been enrolled in life
science standards, they were less well represented in physics, calculus, and
vocational (e.g., agriculture, practical technology) standards. Our results
also show that the enrolment patterns of the Maori and Pacific Islands
sub-populations had higher levels of entropy, an observation that may be
explained by fewer enrolments in key science and mathematics standards. Through
further investigation of this disparity, we find that ethnic group differences
in entropy are moderated by high school SES, such that the difference in
entropy between Maori and Pacific Islands students, and European and Asian
students is even greater. We discuss these findings in the context of the New

applications in knowledge discovery and prediction. Learning a Bayesian network
(BN) from data can be cast as an optimization problem using the well-known
score-and-search approach. However, selecting a single model (i.e., the best
scoring BN) can be misleading or may not achieve the best possible accuracy. An
alternative to committing to a single model is to perform some form of Bayesian
or frequentist model averaging, where the space of possible BNs is sampled or
enumerated in some fashion. Unfortunately, existing approaches for model
averaging either severely restrict the structure of the Bayesian network or
have only been shown to scale to networks with fewer than 30 random variables.
In this paper, we propose a novel approach to model averaging inspired by
performance guarantees in approximation algorithms. Our approach has two
primary advantages. First, our approach only considers credible models in that
they are optimal or near-optimal in score. Second, our approach is more
efficient and scales to significantly larger Bayesian networks than existing
approaches.

strings loops, a number of key parameters have to be assumed. These include the
typical number of cusps per period of string oscillation and the typical values
of the sharpness parameters of left and right moving waves on the string,
evaluated at the cusp event. Both of these are important, as the power stored
in the gravitational waves emitted from the loops of string is proportional to
the number of cusps per period, and inversely proportional to the product of
the sharpness parameters associated with the left and right moving modes on the
string. In suitable units both of these quantities are usually thought to be of
order unity. In order to try and place these parameters on a more robust
footing, we analyse in detail a large number of randomly chosen loops of string
that can have high harmonics associated with them, such as one might expect to
form by chopping off an infinite string in the early universe. This allows us
to analyse tens of thousands of loops and obtain detailed statistics on these
crucial parameters. While we find in general the sharpness parameters are
indeed close to unity, as assumed in previous work (with occasional exceptions
where they can become $O(10^{-2})$), the cusp number per period scales directly
with the number of harmonics on the loop and can be significantly larger than
unity. This opens up the possibility of larger signals than would have
otherwise been expected, potentially leading to tighter bounds on the
dimensionless cosmic string tension $G\mu$.

other non-linear controllers, stability analysis for these controllers is
complex and needs parametric models of the systems. Consequently, the
applicability of these controllers may diminish in industry. The well-known Hb
method is one of the solutions of this significant problem. Nevertheless,
assessing the Hb condition in the frequency-domain is complex, particularly for
high dimensional plants. Furthermore, it cannot assess UBIBS stability of reset
control systems in the case of reseting to non-zero values. In this paper, the
aforementioned problems have been solved for the first and second order reset
elements and a frequency-domain approach for assessing stability of reset
control systems is developed. Finally, some practical examples are presented to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach to use the frequency
response measurement directly to assess the stability.

resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. Our model consists of two coupled terms. The
first term decomposes the correlation matrices into a sparse set of
representative subnetworks that define a network manifold. These subnetworks
are modeled as rank-one outer-products which correspond to the elemental
patterns of co-activation across the brain; the subnetworks are combined via
patient-specific non-negative coefficients. The second term is a linear
regression model that uses the patient-specific coefficients to predict a
measure of clinical severity. We validate our framework on two separate
datasets in a ten fold cross validation setting. The first is a cohort of
fifty-eight patients diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The second
dataset consists of sixty three patients from a publicly available ASD
database. Our method outperforms standard semi-supervised frameworks, which
employ conventional graph theoretic and statistical representation learning
techniques to relate the rs-fMRI correlations to behavior. In contrast, our
joint network optimization framework exploits the structure of the rs-fMRI
correlation matrices to simultaneously capture group level effects and patient
heterogeneity. Finally, we demonstrate that our proposed framework robustly
identifies clinically relevant networks characteristic of ASD.

  biophysics","Typos corrected",,"10.3390/e23020172",,"physics.gen-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Electrodynamics is usually written with a polarization vector field to
describe the response of matter to electric fields, or more specifically, to
describe changes in distribution of charge as an electric field is changed.
This approach does not allow unique specification of a polarization field from
measurements of electric and magnetic fields. Many polarization fields produce
the same electric and magnetic fields, because only the divergence of the
polarization enters Maxwell's first equation, relating charge and electric
field. The curl of any function can be added to a polarization field without
changing the electric field at all. The divergence of the curl is always zero.
Models of structures that produce polarization cannot be uniquely determined
from electrical measurements for the same reason. Models must describe charge
distribution not just distribution of polarization to be unique. I propose a
different paradigm to describe field dependent charge, i.e., to describe the
phenomena of polarization. I propose an operational definition of polarization
that has worked well in biophysics where a field dependent, time dependent
polarization provides the gating current that makes neuronal sodium and
potassium channels respond to voltage. The operational definition has been
applied successfully to experiments for nearly fifty years. Estimates of
polarization have been computed from simulations, models, and theories using
this definition and they fit experimental data quite well. I propose that the
same operational definition be used to define polarization charge in
experiments, models, computations, theories, and simulations of other systems.
Charge movement needs to be computed from a combination of electrodynamics and
mechanics because 'everything interacts with everything else'. The classical
polarization field need not enter into that treatment at all.

alone. The geometric structure of the spacetime identified exhibits a locally
degenerate description in terms of an inherent ambiguity in the apparent matter
field content, in a manner consistent with the Einstein field equation of
general relativity while also incorporating an intrinsic indeterminacy that is
characteristic of quantum phenomena. Here the quantum properties of all
non-gravitational fields arise from this composition of spacetime, rather than
via a postulated set of rules applied in spacetime to be extended and applied
to the gravitational field or spacetime itself. The contrast with several other
approaches to quantum gravity and the manner in which this framework can
