covering inductive logic programming (ILP) algorithms (e.g., FOIL) apply
hill-climbing search using heuristics from information theory. A major issue
with this class of algorithms is getting stuck in a local optimum. In our new
approach, however, the data-dependent hill-climbing search is replaced with a
model-dependent search where a globally optimal SVM model is trained first,
then the algorithm looks into support vectors as the most influential data
points in the model, and induces a clause that would cover the support vector
and points that are most similar to that support vector. Instead of defining a
fixed hypothesis search space, our algorithm makes use of SHAP, an
example-specific interpreter in explainable AI, to determine a relevant set of
features. This approach yields an algorithm that captures SVM model's
underlying logic and outperforms %GG: the FOIL algorithm --> other ILP

characterized by instabilities and multiple bifurcations. GBK models consist of
interconnected masses that can slide on a rough surface under friction. All
masses are connected to a plate, which slowly provides energy to the system.
The system displays long periods of quiescence, interrupted by fast, dynamic
events (avalanches) of energy relaxation. During these events, clusters of
blocks slide abruptly, simulating seismic slip and earthquake rupture. Here we
propose a theory for preventing GBK avalanches, control its dynamics and incite
slow-slip. We exploit the dependence of friction on pressure and use it as a
backdoor for altering the dynamics of the system. We use the mathematical
Theory of Control and, for the first time, we succeed in (a) stabilizing and
restricting chaos in GBK models, (b) guaranteeing slow frictional dissipation
and (c) tuning the GBK system toward desirable global asymptotic equilibria of
lower energy. Our control approach is robust and does not require exact
knowledge of the frictional behavior of the system. Finally, GBK models are
known to present Self-Organized Critical (SOC) behavior. Therefore, the
presented methodology shows an additional example of SOC Control (SOCC). Given
that the dynamics of GBK models show many analogies with earthquakes, we expect
to inspire earthquake mitigation strategies regarding anthropogenic and/or
natural seismicity. In a wider perspective, our control approach could be used
for improving understanding of cascade failures in complex systems in
geophysics, access hidden characteristics and improve their predictability by
controlling their spatio-temporal behavior in real-time.

cosine-distance virtual adversarial training (CD-VAT). In comparison to many
existing SSL techniques, the unlabelled data does not have to come from the
same set of classes (here speakers) as the labelled data. The effectiveness of
CD-VAT is shown on the 2750+ hour VoxCeleb data set, where on a speaker

paper, we propose a two-stage detection method for massive MIMO systems with
one-bit ADCs. In the first stage, we propose several linear receivers based on
the Bussgang decomposition, that show significant performance gain over
existing linear receivers. Next, we reformulate the maximum-likelihood (ML)

detection problem, we propose a model-driven deep neural network-based
(DNN-based) receiver, whose performance is comparable with an existing support
vector machine-based receiver, albeit with a much lower computational
complexity. A nearest-neighbor search method is then proposed for the second
stage to refine the first stage solution. Unlike existing search methods that
typically perform the search over a large candidate set, the proposed search
method generates a limited number of most likely candidates and thus limits the
search complexity. Numerical results confirm the low complexity, efficiency,

study how strategic servers impact the system performance. We consider a
discrete-time process in which, heterogeneous types of customers and servers
arrive. Each customer joins their type's queue, while servers might join a
different type's queue depending on the prices posted by the system operator
and an inconvenience cost. Then the system operator, constrained by a
compatibility graph, decides the matching. The objective is to design an
optimal control (pricing and matching scheme) to maximize the profit minus the
expected waiting times. We develop a general framework that enables us to
analyze a broad range of strategic behaviors. In particular, we encode servers'
behavior in a properly defined \emph{cost function} that can be tailored to
various settings. Using this general cost function, we introduce a novel
probabilistic fluid problem. The probabilistic fluid model provides an upper
bound on the achievable net profit. We then study the system under a large
market regime in which the arrival rates are scaled by $\eta$ and present a
probabilistic two-price policy and a max-weight matching policy which results
in a net profit-loss of at most $O(\eta^{1/3})$. In addition, under a broad
class of customer pricing policies, we show that any matching policy has net
profit-loss of at least $\Omega(\eta^{1/3})$. To show generality of our
framework, we present multiple extensions to our model and analysis. We
conclude the discussion by presenting numerical simulations comparing different
cost models and analyzing performance of the proposed pricing and matching
policies.

regularized illumination optimization and deep noise suppression. In
particular, a hybrid regularized variational model, which combines L0-norm
gradient sparsity prior with structure-aware regularization, is presented to
refine the coarse illumination map originally estimated using Max-RGB. The
adaptive gamma correction method is then introduced to adjust the refined
illumination map. Based on the assumption of Retinex theory, a guided
filter-based detail boosting method is introduced to optimize the reflection
map. The adjusted illumination and optimized reflection maps are finally
combined to generate the enhanced maritime images. To suppress the effect of
unwanted noise on imaging performance, a deep learning-based blind denoising
framework is further introduced to promote the visual quality of enhanced
image. In particular, this framework is composed of two sub-networks, i.e.,
E-Net and D-Net adopted for noise level estimation and non-blind noise
reduction, respectively. The main benefit of our image enhancement method is
that it takes full advantage of the regularized illumination optimization and
deep blind denoising. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on both
synthetic and realistic maritime images to compare our proposed method with
several state-of-the-art imaging methods. Experimental results have illustrated
its superior performance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative

the time-horizon goes to infinity becomes natural. Assuming that the controlled
dynamics under consideration are stabilizable towards a stationary solution,
the following natural question arises: Do time averages of optimal controls and
trajectories converge to the stationary optimal controls and states as the
time-horizon goes to infinity? This question is very closely related to the
so-called turnpike property that shows that, often times, the optimal
trajectory joining two points that are far apart, consists in, departing from
the point of origin, rapidly getting close to the steady-state (the turnpike)
to stay there most of the time, to quit it only very close to the final
destination and time. In the present paper we deal with heat equations with
non-zero exterior conditions (Dirichlet and nonlocal Robin) associated with the
fractional Laplace operator $(-\Delta)^s$ ($0<s<1$). We prove the turnpike
property for the nonlocal Robin optimal control problem and the exponential
turnpike property for both Dirichlet and nonlocal Robin optimal control
problems.

non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) of the gene expression data matrix and
survival regression with Cox proportional hazards model. In this work, Cox
proportional hazards regression is integrated with NMF by imposing survival

partial log likelihood for events such as death or relapse. Simulation results
on synthetic data demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method, when
compared to other algorithms, in finding survival associated gene clusters. In
addition, using human cancer gene expression data, the proposed technique can
unravel critical clusters of cancer genes. The discovered gene clusters reflect

enhance the resilience of active distribution networks. However, the large

distribution service restoration (DDSR) strategies. This paper proposes a
scalable distributed optimization method based on the alternating direction
method of multipliers (ADMM) for non-convex mixed-integer optimization problems
and applies to develop the DDSR framework. The non-convex ADMM method consists
of relax-drive-polish phases, 1) relaxing binary variables and applying the
convex ADMM as a warm start; 2) driving the solutions toward Boolean values
through a proximal operator; 3) fixing the obtained binary variables to polish
continuous variables for a high-quality solution. Then, an autonomous
clustering strategy together with consensus ADMM is developed to realize the
distributed cluster-based framework of restoration. The nonconvex ADMM-based
DDSR can determine DER scheduling and switch status for reconfiguration and
load pickup in a distributed manner, energizing the out-of-service area from
local faults or total blackouts in large-scale distribution networks. The
effectiveness and scalability of the proposed DDSR framework are demonstrated

sufficient discriminative features spreading over all skeleton joints, so that
the distributed redundant representation reduces the sensitivity of the action

activation degrees of skeleton joints of each GCN stream are measured by the
class activation maps (CAM), and only the information from the unactivated
joints will be passed to the next stream, by which rich features over all
active joints are obtained. Thus, the proposed method is termed richly

RA-GCN achieves comparable performance on the standard NTU RGB+D 60 and 120

most research on robot lifting, ""feasibility"" is usually presumed to exist a
priori. This paper proposes a three-step method for a humanoid robot to reason
about the feasibility of lifting a heavy box with physical properties that are
unknown to the robot. Since feasibility of lifting is directly related to the
physical properties of the box, we first discretize a range for the unknown
values of parameters describing these properties and tabulate all valid optimal
quasi-static lifting trajectories generated by simulations over all
combinations of indices. Second, a physical-interaction-based algorithm is
introduced to identify the robust gripping position and physical parameters
corresponding to the box. During this process, the stability and safety of the
robot are ensured. On the basis of the above two steps, a third step of mapping
operation is carried out to best match the estimated parameters to the indices
in the table. The matched indices are then queried to determine whether a valid
trajectory exists. If so, the lifting motion is feasible; otherwise, the robot
decides that the task is beyond its capability. Our method efficiently
evaluates the feasibility of a lifting task through simple interactions between
the robot and the box, while simultaneously obtaining the desired safe and
stable trajectory. We successfully demonstrated the proposed method using a NAO

calculate the viscous dissipation near the contact line. Following the approach
compatible with the capillary-viscous force balance, we establish the evolution
equation for describing the temporal evolution of the contact line during

by the present experimental observations, our analysis deems efficient to
capture the phenomenon during the late-stage of spreading for which the effect
of line tension becomes dominant. An increment in the viscoelastic parameter of
the fluid increases the viscous dissipation effect at the contact line. It is
seen that the higher dissipation effect leads to an enhancement in the wetting
time of the drop on the spherical substrate. Also, we have shown that the
elastic nature of fluid leads to an increment in the dynamic contact angle at
any temporal instant as compared to its Newtonian counterpart. Finally, we
unveil that the phenomenon of increasing contact angle results in the time

viscoelasticity of the fluid. This article will fill a gap still affecting the

  http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~xdwang/projects/CLD/",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unsupervised feature learning has made great strides with contrastive
learning based on instance discrimination and invariant mapping, as benchmarked
on curated class-balanced datasets. However, natural data could be highly
correlated and long-tail distributed. Natural between-instance similarity
conflicts with the presumed instance distinction, causing unstable training and
poor performance.
  Our idea is to discover and integrate between-instance similarity into
contrastive learning, not directly by instance grouping, but by cross-level
discrimination (CLD) between instances and local instance groups. While
invariant mapping of each instance is imposed by attraction within its
augmented views, between-instance similarity could emerge from common repulsion
against instance groups.
  Our batch-wise and cross-view comparisons also greatly improve the
positive/negative sample ratio of contrastive learning and achieve better
invariant mapping. To effect both grouping and discrimination objectives, we
impose them on features separately derived from a shared representation. In
addition, we propose normalized projection heads and unsupervised
hyper-parameter tuning for the first time.
  Our extensive experimentation demonstrates that CLD is a lean and powerful
add-on to existing methods such as NPID, MoCo, InfoMin, and BYOL on highly
correlated, long-tail, or balanced datasets. It not only achieves new
state-of-the-art on self-supervision, semi-supervision, and transfer learning
benchmarks, but also beats MoCo v2 and SimCLR on every reported performance
attained with a much larger compute. CLD effectively brings unsupervised
learning closer to natural data and real-world applications. Our code is

encounters with the major planets. Since the dynamics of this asteroid is
predictable only on short time intervals, and not only close and/or multiple
close encounters with major planets, but also the presence of at least one
unstable resonance can lead to chaotic motion of test particles, we studied
their resonant dynamics. The dynamical evolution of the test particles expects
possible scenario for resonant motion. We conjecture that the reasons of chaos
are the overlap of stable secular resonances and unstable mean motions
resonances and close and/or multiple close encounters with the major planets.
The estimate of the stability of orbits in which the particles in simulations
moved was carried out by analyzing the behavior of the parameter MEGNO (Mean
Exponential Growth factor of Nearby Orbits). The larger part of the identified
resonances is stable. We found a peculiar behavior for this stream. Here, we
show that the orbits of some ejected particles are strongly affected by the
Lidov-Kozai mechanism that protects them from close encounters with Jupiter.
Lack of close encounters with Jupiter leads to a rather smooth growth in the
parameter MEGNO and the behavior imply the stable motion of simulation
particles of the Quadrantids meteoroid stream.

bcc and hcp HEA superconductors and discuss the simple material design. The
concept of HEA is extended to materials possessing multiple crystallographic
sites; thus, we also introduce multi-site HEA superconductors with the
CsCl-type, {\alpha}-Mn-type, A15, NaCl-type, {\sigma}-phase and layered
structures and discuss the materials research on multi-site HEA

analysis of current and future wide-field optical surveys. However, the galaxy
models used as the basis for these simulations are typically limited to simple
parametric light profiles, or use a fairly limited amount of available
space-based data. In this work, we propose a methodology based on Deep
Generative Models to create complex models of galaxy morphologies that may meet
the image simulation needs of upcoming surveys. We address the technical
challenges associated with learning this morphology model from noisy and
PSF-convolved images by building a hybrid Deep Learning/physical Bayesian
hierarchical model for observed images, explicitly accounting for the Point
Spread Function and noise properties. The generative model is further made
conditional on physical galaxy parameters, to allow for sampling new light
profiles from specific galaxy populations. We demonstrate our ability to train
and sample from such a model on galaxy postage stamps from the HST/ACS COSMOS
survey, and validate the quality of the model using a range of second- and
higher-order morphology statistics. Using this set of statistics, we
demonstrate significantly more realistic morphologies using these deep
generative models compared to conventional parametric models. To help make
these generative models practical tools for the community, we introduce
GalSim-Hub, a community-driven repository of generative models, and a framework
for incorporating generative models within the GalSim image simulation

the Pretrained Autoencoder module (PAM). Specifically, GCM and GAM separately
train a dual in-painting network using data from the domain $X$ for gaze
correction and data from the domain $Y$ for gaze animation. Additionally, a
Synthesis-As-Training method is proposed when training GAM to encourage the
features encoded from the eye region to be correlated with the angle
information, resulting in a gaze animation which can be achieved by
interpolation in the latent space. To further preserve the identity
information~(e.g., eye shape, iris color), we propose the PAM with an
Autoencoder, which is based on Self-Supervised mirror learning where the
bottleneck features are angle-invariant and which works as an extra input to
the dual in-painting models. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness

effective viscosity of a Stokes fluid with a suspension of small rigid
particles at low density. His formal derivation relied on two implicit
assumptions: (i) there is a scale separation between the size of the particles
and the observation scale; and (ii) at first order, dilute particles do not
interact with one another. In mathematical terms, the first assumption amounts
to the validity of a homogenization result defining the effective viscosity
tensor, which is now well understood. Next, the second assumption allowed
Einstein to approximate this effective viscosity at low density by considering
particles as being isolated. The rigorous justification is, in fact, quite
subtle as the effective viscosity is a nonlinear nonlocal function of the
ensemble of particles and as hydrodynamic interactions have borderline
integrability. In the present memoir, we establish Einstein's effective
viscosity formula in the most general setting. In addition, we pursue the
low-density expansion to arbitrary order in form of a cluster expansion, where
the summation of hydrodynamic interactions crucially requires suitable
renormalizations. In particular, we justify a celebrated result by Batchelor
and Green on the second-order correction and we explicitly describe all
higher-order renormalizations for the first time. In some specific settings, we
further address the summability of the whole cluster expansion. Our approach
relies on a combination of combinatorial arguments, variational analysis,
elliptic regularity, probability theory, and diagrammatic integration methods.

systems that are visible to gravitational-wave observatories. Given that no
ultra-compact BNS systems have been discovered in pulsar radio surveys, we
place a 95\% confidence upper limit of $\sim$850 and $\sim$1100 ultra-compact
neutron star--white dwarf and double neutron star (DNS) systems that are
beaming towards the Earth, respectively. We show that among all of the current
radio pulsar surveys, the ones at the Arecibo radio telescope have the best
chance of detecting an ultra-compact BNS system. We also show that adopting a
survey integration time of $t_{\rm int} \sim 1$~min will maximize the
signal-to-noise ratio, and thus, the probability of detecting an ultra-compact
BNS system. Similarly, we use the sample of nine observed DNS systems to derive
a Galactic DNS merger rate of $\mathcal{R}_{\rm MW} =
37^{+24}_{-11}$~Myr$^{-1}$, where the errors represent 90\% confidence
intervals. Extrapolating this rate to the observable volume for LIGO, we derive
a merger detection rate of $\mathcal{R} = 1.9^{+1.2}_{-0.6} \times \left(D_{\rm
r}/100 \ \rm Mpc \right)^3 \rm yr^{-1}$, where $D_{\rm r}$ is the range
distance for LIGO. This rate is consistent with that derived using the DNS
mergers observed by LIGO. Finally, we measure the sense of rotation of the
older millisecond pulsar, pulsar A, in the DNS J0737--3039 system and find that
it rotates prograde with respect to its orbit. This is the first direct
measurement of the sense of rotation of a pulsar and a direct confirmation of
the rotating lighthouse model for pulsars. This result confirms that the spin
angular momentum vector is closely aligned with the orbital angular momentum,

unified formalism for this analysis is provided by a symmetry-preserving
Schwinger-Dyson equations treatment of a vector$\times$vector contact
interaction model which encodes several well-established features of quantum
chromodynamics to mimic the latter as closely as possible. Deconfinement and
chiral symmetry restoration are triggered above a critical value of $N_f$ at

interactions, thus ensuring that a smaller value of $N_f$ is sufficient to
restore chiral symmetry at higher temperatures. We also observe the well-known
phenomenon of magnetic catalysis for a strong enough magnetic field. However,
we note that if the effective coupling strength of the model decreases as a
function of magnetic field, it can trigger inverse magnetic catalysis in a
certain window of this functional dependence. Our model allows for the
simultaneous onset of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking and confinement for

modality discrepancy and insufficient cross-modal samples. Most existing works
focus on discriminative feature transformation, metric learning and cross-modal
face synthesis. However, the fact that cross-modal faces are always coupled by
domain (modality) and identity information has received little attention.
Therefore, how to learn and utilize the domain-private feature and
domain-agnostic feature for modality adaptive face recognition is the focus of
this work. Specifically, this paper proposes a Feature Aggregation Network
(FAN), which includes disentangled representation module (DRM), feature fusion
module (FFM) and adaptive penalty metric (APM) learning session. First, in DRM,
two subnetworks, i.e. domain-private network and domain-agnostic network are
specially designed for learning modality features and identity features,
respectively. Second, in FFM, the identity features are fused with domain
features to achieve cross-modal bi-directional identity feature transformation,
which, to a large extent, further disentangles the modality information and
identity information. Third, considering that the distribution imbalance
between easy and hard pairs exists in cross-modal datasets, which increases the
risk of model bias, the identity preserving guided metric learning with
adaptive hard pairs penalization is proposed in our FAN. The proposed APM also
guarantees the cross-modality intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation. Extensive experiments on benchmark cross-modal face datasets show
that our FAN outperforms SOTA methods.

SS~Cyg, VW~Hyi and SS~Aur) observed in the quiescence and outburst states. In

with up to two thermal Comptonization components (compTT or compTB models in

this framework the two seed photon components are coming presumably from the

phonons from standard group-theoretical method in isotropic materials would
break down in anisotropic layered materials (ALMs) due to birefringence and
linear dichroism effects. The two effects result in depth-dependent
polarization and intensity of incident laser and scattered signal inside ALMs
and thus make a challenge to predict ARPR intensity at any laser incidence
direction. Herein, taking in-plane anisotropic black phosphorus as a prototype,
we developed a so-called birefringence-linear-dichroism (BLD) model to
quantitatively understand its ARPR intensity at both normal and oblique laser
incidences by the same set of real Raman tensors for certain laser excitation.
No fitting parameter is needed, once the birefringence and linear dichroism
effects are considered with the complex refractive indexes. An approach was
proposed to experimentally determine real Raman tensor and complex refractive
indexes, respectively, from the relative Raman intensity along its principle
axes and incident-angle resolved reflectivity by Fresnel$'$s law. The results
suggest that the previously reported ARPR intensity of ultrathin ALM flakes
deposited on a multilayered substrate at normal laser incidence can be also
understood based on the BLD model by considering the depth-dependent
polarization and intensity of incident laser and scattered Raman signal induced
by both birefringence and linear dichroism effects within ALM flakes and the
interference effects in the multilayered structures, which are dependent on the
excitation wavelength, thickness of ALM flakes and dielectric layers of the
substrate. This work can be generally applicable to any opaque anisotropic
crystals, offering a promising route to predict and manipulate the polarized
behaviors of related phonons.

measurement of the effective weak mixing angle
$\sin^2\theta_{\text{eff}}^{\ell}$ at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The
PDF-induced uncertainty is large in the proton-proton collisions at the LHC due
to the dilution effect. The measurement of the Drell-Yan forward-backward
asymmetry ($A_{FB}$) at the LHC can be used to reduce the PDF uncertainty in
the $\sin^2\theta_{\text{eff}}^{\ell}$ measurement. However, when including the
full mass range of lepton pairs in the $A_{FB}$ data analysis, the correlation
between the PDF updating procedure and the $\sin^2\theta_{\text{eff}}^{\ell}$
extraction leads to a sizable bias in the obtained
$\sin^2\theta_{\text{eff}}^{\ell}$ value. From our studies, we find that the
bias can be significantly reduced by removing Drell-Yan events with invariant
mass around the $Z$ pole region, while most of the sensitivity in reducing the
PDF uncertainty remains. Furthermore, the lepton charge asymmetry in the $W$
boson events as a function of the rapidity of the charged leptons,
$A_\pm(\eta_\ell)$, is known to be another observable which can be used to
reduce the PDF uncertainty in the $\sin^2\theta_{\text{eff}}^{\ell}$
measurement. The constraint from $A_\pm(\eta_\ell)$ is complementary to that
from the $A_{FB}$, thus no bias affects the $\sin^2\theta_{\text{eff}}^{\ell}$
extraction. The studies are performed using the Error PDF Updating Method
Package ({\sc ePump}), which is based on the Hessian updating methods. In this

monitored so that they do not cause secondary infections, and all infected
persons are reported, respectively. We consider three special scenarios: (1)
perfect monitoring and perfect tracking of contacts of a reported case, (2)
perfect reporting of cases and perfect monitoring of tracked reported cases and
(3) perfect reporting and perfect tracking of contacts of reported cases.
Furthermore, we gave a lower bound on the proportion of contacts to be traced
to ensure that the effective reproduction, ${\mathcal{R}_c}$, is below one and
describe ${\mathcal{R}_c}$ in terms of observable quantities such as the
proportion of reported and traced cases. Model simulations using the COVID-19

Health Outcomes. MLHO implements iterative sequential representation mining,
and feature and model selection, for predicting the patient-level risk of
hospitalization, ICU admission, need for mechanical ventilation, and death. It
bases this prediction on data from patients' past medical records (before their
COVID-19 infection). MLHO's architecture enables a parallel and
outcome-oriented model calibration, in which different statistical learning
algorithms and vectors of features are simultaneously tested to improve the
prediction of health outcomes. Using clinical and demographic data from a large
cohort of over 13,000 COVID-19-positive patients, we modeled the four adverse
outcomes utilizing about 600 features representing patients' pre-COVID health
records and demographics. The mean AUC ROC for mortality prediction was 0.91,
while the prediction performance ranged between 0.80 and 0.81 for the ICU,
hospitalization, and ventilation. We broadly describe the clusters of features
that were utilized in modeling and their relative influence for predicting each
outcome. Our results demonstrated that while demographic variables (namely age)
are important predictors of adverse outcomes after a COVID-19 infection, the
incorporation of the past clinical records are vital for a reliable prediction
model. As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds around the world, adaptable and
interpretable machine learning frameworks (like MLHO) are crucial to improve
our readiness for confronting the potential future waves of COVID-19, as well
as other novel infectious diseases that may emerge.

-) symmetric cavity magnomechanical system. There is magnetic dipole
interaction between the cavity and photon-magnon, and there is also
magnetostrictive interaction which is induced by the phononmagnon coupling in
this system. By introducing blue-detuned driving microwave field to the system,
the bipartite entanglement of the system with PT -symmetry is significantly
enhanced versus the case in the conventional cavity magnomechanical systems
(loss-loss systems). Moreover, the one-way quantum steering between
magnon-phonon and photon-phonon modes can be obtained in the unbroken-PT
-symmetric regime. The boundary of stability is demonstrated and this show that
the steady-state solutions are more stable in the gain and loss systems. This
work opens up a route to explore the characteristics of quantum entanglement
and steering in magnomechanical systems, which might have potential
applications in quantum state engineering and quantum information.

  Decomposable Graphical Model",,,"10.1109/TSP.2021.3077302",,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A quickest change detection problem is considered in a sensor network with
observations whose statistical dependency structure across the sensors before
and after the change is described by a decomposable graphical model (DGM).
Distributed computation methods for this problem are proposed that are capable
of producing the optimum centralized test statistic. The DGM leads to the
proper way to collect nodes into local groups equivalent to cliques in the
graph, such that a clique statistic which summarizes all the clique sensor data
can be computed within each clique. The clique statistics are transmitted to a
decision maker to produce the optimum centralized test statistic. In order to
further improve communication efficiency, an ordered transmission approach is
proposed where transmissions of the clique statistics to the fusion center are
ordered and then adaptively halted when sufficient information is accumulated.
This procedure is always guaranteed to provide the optimal change detection
performance, despite not transmitting all the statistics from all the cliques.
A lower bound on the average number of transmissions saved by ordered
transmissions is provided and for the case where the change seldom occurs the
lower bound approaches approximately half the number of cliques provided a well
behaved distance measure between the distributions of the sensor observations
before and after the change is sufficiently large. We also extend the approach
to the case when the graph structure is different under each hypothesis.
Numerical results show significant savings using the ordered transmission
approach and validate the theoretical findings.

enormous data sources in the filed of system identification. Often, it is
essential to understand internal working mechanisms of unknown systems (e.g.
biological networks) in addition to input-output relationships. For this
purpose, various feature selection techniques have been developed. For example,
sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) was proposed to learn major features from a
dictionary of basis functions, which makes identified models interpretable.
Reweighted L1-regularization algorithms are often applied in SBL to solve
optimization problems. However, they are expensive in both computation and
memory aspects, thus not suitable for large-scale problems. This paper proposes
an adaptive support driven Bayesian reweighted (ASDBR) algorithm for sparse
signal recovery. A restart strategy based on shrinkage-thresholding is
developed to conduct adaptive support estimate, which can effectively reduce
computation burden and memory demands. Moreover, ASDBR accurately extracts
major features and excludes redundant information from large datasets.

Then the resulting weights are applied to Monte Carlo sampl\ es from an actual

the model with spiking neurons displays a threshold of stimulus amplitude for
the activity to gain access to the prefrontal cortex, reminiscent of the
ignition phenomenon associated with conscious perception. These two examples
illustrate how connectomics may inform theory leading to discoveries.
Computational modeling raises open questions for future empirical research, in
a back-and-forth collaboration of experimentalists and theorists.

and a bandpass frequency-selective surface. These two layers are separated by
an air layer. Each layer has an embedded bias network that provides the bias
voltage to the diodes through metallic via. This configuration can avoid
undesirable effects associated with the additional biasing wire. When the
diodes are in off-state, the structure is in FSR mode and exhibits a
transmission window at 4.28GHz with only 0.69dB insertion loss (IL) within the
absorption bands. While diodes are in on-state and the structure switches to
absorber mode, it achieves perfect absorption with absorptivity of over 90%
ranging from 2.8 to 5.2 GHz. An equivalent circuit model (ECM) is developed to
analyse the physical mechanism of the structure. A prototype of the proposed
architecture is fabricated and measured, where reasonable agreements between
simulations and measurements are observed, verifying the effectiveness of this

For flexibility in grid generation we would like to consider coarsening factors

We study the use of different Galerkin and non-Galerkin coarse-level operators.
We use red-black smoothers with a relaxation parameter $\omega$. Using local
Fourier analysis we choose $\omega$ and the coarse-level operators to optimize
the overall multigrid convergence rate. Motivated by the use of red-black
smoothers in one dimension that can result in a direct solver for the standard

distinguish the different enantiomers of chiral structures. It has been applied
to natural materials (e.g. molecules) as well as to artificial materials (e.g.
nanophotonic structures). However, especially for chiral molecules the signal
level is very low and increasing the signal-to-noise ratio is of paramount
importance to either shorten the necessary measurement time or to lower the
minimum detectable molecule concentration. As one solution to this problem, we
propose here to use quantum states of light in CD sensing to reduce the noise
below the shot noise limit that is encountered when using coherent states of
light. Through a multi-parameter estimation approach, we identify the ultimate
quantum limit to precision of CD sensing, allowing for general schemes
including additional ancillary modes. We show that the ultimate quantum limit
can be achieved by various optimal schemes. It includes not only Fock state
input in direct sensing configuration but also twin-beam input in
ancilla-assisted sensing configuration, for both of which photon number
resolving detection needs to be performed as the optimal measurement setting.
These optimal schemes offer a significant quantum enhancement even in the
presence of additional system loss. The optimality of a practical scheme using
a twin-beam state in direct sensing configuration is also investigated in
details as a nearly optimal scheme for CD sensing when the actual CD signal is
very small. Alternative schemes involving single-photon sources and detectors
are also proposed. This work paves the way for further investigations of

MAE or MSE loss with empirically slow convergence. It is well-known that
normalization can facilitate fast convergence. Therefore, we explore
normalization in the design of loss functions for IQA. Specifically, we first
normalize the predicted quality scores and the corresponding subjective quality
scores. Then, the loss is defined based on the norm of the differences between
these normalized values. The resulting ""Norm-in-Norm'' loss encourages the IQA
model to make linear predictions with respect to subjective quality scores.
After training, the least squares regression is applied to determine the linear
mapping from the predicted quality to the subjective quality. It is shown that
the new loss is closely connected with two common IQA performance criteria
(PLCC and RMSE). Through theoretical analysis, it is proved that the embedded
normalization makes the gradients of the loss function more stable and more
predictable, which is conducive to the faster convergence of the IQA model.
Furthermore, to experimentally verify the effectiveness of the proposed loss,
it is applied to solve a challenging problem: quality assessment of in-the-wild
images. Experiments on two relevant datasets (KonIQ-10k and CLIVE) show that,
compared to MAE or MSE loss, the new loss enables the IQA model to converge
about 10 times faster and the final model achieves better performance. The
proposed model also achieves state-of-the-art prediction performance on this
challenging problem. For reproducible scientific research, our code is publicly

accelerate computation of aggregates using samples, for which confidence

practice fall into two categories: techniques that are tight but not correct,
i.e., they yield tight intervals but only offer asymptotic guarantees, making
them unreliable, or techniques that are correct but not tight, i.e., they offer
rigorous guarantees, but are overly conservative, leading to confidence
intervals that are too loose to be useful. In this paper, we develop a CI
technique that is both correct and tighter than traditional approaches.
Starting from conservative CIs, we identify two issues they often face:
pessimistic mass allocation (PMA) and phantom outlier sensitivity (PHOS). By
developing a novel range-trimming technique for eliminating PHOS and pairing it
with known CI techniques without PMA, we develop a technique for computing CIs
with strong guarantees that requires fewer samples for the same width. We
implement our techniques underneath a sampling-optimized in-memory column store

  Positive partial transposition (PPT) states are an important class of states
in quantum information. We show a method to calculate bounds for entangling
capacity, the amount of entanglement that can be produced by a quantum
operation, in terms of negativity, a measure of entanglement. The bounds of
entangling capacity are found to be associated with how non-PPT (PPT
preserving) an operation is. A length that quantifies both entangling
capacity/entanglement and PPT-ness of an operation or state can be defined,
establishing a geometry characterized by PPT-ness. The distance derived from
the length bounds the relative entangling capability, endowing the geometry
with more physical significance.
  For a system composed of permutationally symmetric Gaussian modes, by
identifying the boundary of valid states and making necessary change of
variables, the existence and exact value of the supremum of logarithmic
negativity (and negativity likewise) between any two blocks can be shown
analytically. Involving only the total number of interchangeable modes and the
sizes of respective blocks, this result is general and easy to be applied for

second-order DARTS. In this paper, we formulate a single level alternative and
a relaxed architecture search (RARTS) method that utilizes the whole dataset in
architecture learning via both data and network splitting, without involving
mixed second derivatives of the corresponding loss functions like DARTS. In our
formulation of network splitting, two networks with different but related
weights cooperate in search of a shared architecture. The advantage of RARTS
over DARTS is justified by a convergence theorem and an analytically solvable
model. Moreover, RARTS outperforms DARTS and its variants in accuracy and
search efficiency, as shown in adequate experimental results. For the task of
searching topological architecture, i.e., the edges and the operations, RARTS
obtains a higher accuracy and 60\% reduction of computational cost than
second-order DARTS on CIFAR-10. RARTS continues to out-perform DARTS upon
transfer to ImageNet and is on par with recent variants of DARTS even though
our innovation is purely on the training algorithm without modifying search
space. For the task of searching width, i.e., the number of channels in
convolutional layers, RARTS also outperforms the traditional network pruning
benchmarks. Further experiments on the public architecture search benchmark
like NATS-Bench also support the preeminence of RARTS.

algorithms to date. Compared to a collection of state-of-the-art static
multicore algorithms, we obtain an average speedup of 12.4x (2.36x average
speedup over the fastest existing implementation for each graph). Using
ConnectIt, we are able to compute connectivity on the largest
publicly-available graph (with over 3.5 billion vertices and 128 billion edges)
in under 10 seconds using a 72-core machine, providing a 3.1x speedup over the

selecting the best variants in ConnectIt for different situations, we provide a

techniques in ConnectIt can be used to speed up two important graph

and present the first rigorous proof of convergence of ResNets with trained
weights and biases towards a Hamiltonian dynamics driven flow. Our constructive
proof reveals several remarkable properties of ResNets and their GP

warping kernels. Minimizers of $L_2$ regularized ResNets satisfy a discrete
least action principle implying the near preservation of the norm of weights

representation is generally sparse. The kernel regularization strategy provides
a provably robust alternative to Dropout for ANNs. We introduce a functional
generalization of GPs leading to error estimates for ResNets. We identify the

environmental perception. Many lane detection models have been proposed,
solving lane detection under challenging conditions, including intersection
merging and splitting, curves, boundaries, occlusions and combinations of scene
types. Nevertheless, lane detection will remain an open problem for some time
to come. The ability to cope well with those challenging scenes impacts greatly
the applications of lane detection on advanced driver assistance systems
(ADASs). In this paper, a spatio-temporal network with double Convolutional
Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRUs) is proposed to address lane detection in
challenging scenes. Both of ConvGRUs have the same structures, but different
locations and functions in our network. One is used to extract the information
of the most likely low-level features of lane markings. The extracted features
are input into the next layer of the end-to-end network after concatenating
them with the outputs of some blocks. The other one takes some continuous
frames as its input to process the spatio-temporal driving information.
Extensive experiments on the large-scale TuSimple lane marking challenge
dataset and Unsupervised LLAMAS dataset demonstrate that the proposed model can
effectively detect lanes in the challenging driving scenes. Our model can
outperform the state-of-the-art lane detection models.

simultaneously concerned the vehicle dispatching, circulating, fleet sizing,
and patron queueing. As a constrained variational problem, it remains not fully
solved for decades. With technical prowess in graphic analysis, the author
unveiled the closed-form solution for the optimal dispatch rates (with key
variables undetermined though), but only suggested the lower and upper bounds
of the optimal fleet size. Additionally, such a graphic analysis method lacks
high efficiency in computing specific scheduling problems, which are often of a
large scale (e.g., hundreds of bus lines). In light of this, the paper proposes
a novel mathematical solution approach that first relaxes the original problem
to an unconstrained one, and then attacks it using calculus of variations. The
corresponding Euler-Lagrange equation yields the closed-form solution of the
optimal dispatching rates, to which Hurdle's results are a special case. Thanks
to the proposed approach, the optimal fleet size can also be solved. This paper
completes the work of Hurdle (1973) by formalizing a solution method and
generalizing the results. Based on that, we further make two extensions to the
scheduling problem of general bus lines with multiple origins and destinations
and that of mixed-size or modular buses. Closed-form results are also obtained
with new insights. Among others, we find that the solutions for shuttle/feeder
lines are a special case to our results of general bus lines. Numerical
examples are also provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of
the proposed approach.

minimize perturbation of the 2D morphology, a nonthermal oxidation using O2

defect-induced Raman peak, drastic quenching of photoluminescence (PL) signals
and sub-nm protrusions in atomic force microscopy images. As the reaction
proceeded from the uppermost layer to the buried layers, PL and optical second
harmonic generation signals showed characteristic modulations revealing a
layer-by-layer conversion. The plasma-generated 2D oxides, confirmed as MoO3 by
x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, were found to be amorphous but extremely flat
with a surface roughness of 0.18 nm, comparable to that of 1L MoS2. The rate of
oxidation quantified by Raman spectroscopy decreased very rapidly for buried
sulfide layers due to protection by the surface 2D oxides, exhibiting a

spectroscopy of artificially stacked multilayers, we directly proved that

of the Mo oxide layer at the interface demonstrates that O2 diffuses
efficiently through the van der Waals (vdW) gap but not MoO3, which would
otherwise sublime. The fact that TOs are several times larger than TEs
indicates that oxidation is greatly enhanced when MoS2 is in direct contact

that the vdW-bonded interfaces are essentially open to mass transport and can

this can impact device performance. However, it is difficult to account for the
distribution of interface inhomogeneity as most techniques average over the
spot-area of the analytical tool, or the entire device measured for electrical
I-V measurements. Commonly used models to extract Schottky barrier heights
(SBH) neglect or fail to account for such inhomogeneities, which can lead to
the extraction of incorrect SBH and Richardson constants. Here, we show that a
gaussian modified thermionic emission model gives the best fit to experimental
I-V-T data of van der Waals Au/p-MoS2 interfaces and allow the deconvolution of
the SBH of the defective regions from the pristine region. By the inclusion of
a gaussian distributed SBH in the macroscopic I-V-T analysis, we demonstrate
that interface inhomogeneities due to defects are deconvoluted and well
correlated to the impact on the device behavior across a wide temperature range
from room temperature of 300 K down to 120 K. We verified the gaussian
thermionic model across two different types of p-MoS2 (geological and
synthetic), and finally compared the macroscopic SBH with the results of a
nanoscopic technique, ballistic hole emission microscopy (BHEM). The results
obtained using BHEM were consistent with the pristine Au/p-MoS2 SBH extracted
from the gaussian modified thermionic emission model over hundreds of
nanometers. Our findings show that the inclusion of Schottky barrier
inhomogeneities in the analysis of I-V-T data is important to elucidate the
impact of defects (e.g. grain boundaries, metallic impurities, etc.) and hence
their influence on device behavior. We also find that the Richardson constant,
a material specific constant typically treated as merely a fitting constant, is
an important parameter to check for the validity of the transport model.

problem via solving a multi-objective minimization problem under the path

problem is very challenging since it is highly non-convex. Almost all existing
works deal with such a problem using relaxation techniques to transform it to
be a convex optimization problem. However, we provide a novel solution
framework based on the classic alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) approach for solving this problem. Our proposed algorithm is simple and
easy to be implemented. Each step of our algorithm consists of either finding
the maximal root of a single-cubic equation which is guaranteed to have at
least one positive solution or solving a one-dimensional convex subproblem in a
fixed interval. Under some mild assumptions, we prove that any limiting point
of the generated sequence under our proposed algorithm is a stationary point.
Extensive numerical simulations are performed to demonstrate the advantages of
our algorithm compared with various baselines.

collective vibrational mode of excitation. A charge-exchange analog, however,
has been poorly studied in comparison with the spin (magnetic) dipole resonance
(SDR). Purpose: I investigate the role of deformation on the charge-exchange
dipole excitations and explore the generic features as an isovector mode of
excitation. Methods: The nuclear energy-density functional method is employed
for calculating the response functions based on the
Skyrme--Kohn--Sham--Bogoliubov method and the proton-neuton
quasiparticle-random-phase approximation. Results: The deformation splitting
into $K=0$ and $K=\pm 1$ components occurs in the charge-changing channels and
is proportional to the magnitude of deformation as is well known for the GDR.
For the SDR, however, a simple assertion based on geometry of a nucleus cannot
be applied for explaining the vibrational frequencies of each $K$-component. A
qualitative argument on the strength distributions for each component is given
based on the non-energy-weighted sum rules taking nuclear deformation into
account. The concentration of the electric dipole strengths in low energy and
below the giant resonance is found in neutron-rich unstable nuclei.
Conclusions: The deformation splitting occurs generically for the
charge-exchange dipole excitions as in the neutral channel. The analog pygmy
dipole resonance can emerge in deformed neutron-rich nuclei as well as in
spherical systems.

pull-out. This can be attributed to the high maneuverability promoted by
lift-generating vortical structures over the wing. Wind-tunnel experiments on
life-sized models together with high fidelity simulations on idealized models,
which are based on taxidermy falcons in different configurations, show that
deploying the hand-wing in a pull-out creates extra vortex-lift, similar to
that of combat aircraft with delta wings. The aerodynamic forces and the
position of aerodynamic center were calculated from Large Eddy Simulations of
the flow around the model. This allowed for an analysis of the longitudinal
static stability in a pull-out, confirming that the falcon is flying unstably

Currently, the training process effectively provides a point-estimate of the

This may result in a potential over-fitting which may yield sub-optimal results
at inference phase, especially for small-size datasets, frequently present in
the medical imaging domain. We introduce a fully Bayesian framework for
unsupervised DL-based deformable image registration. Our method provides a
principled way to characterize the true posterior distribution, thus, avoiding

conduct the posterior sampling, which is both theoretically well-founded and
computationally efficient. We demonstrated the added-value of our Basyesian

of HabEx and LUVOIR to prevent a false negative answer to this question, in
which we do not detect O$_2$ or O$_3$ on any planet even if all exoEarths are
Earth-like. Our approach is to assign O$_2$ and O$_3$ values drawn from Earth's
history to a distribution of detectable exoEarths and determine whether O$_2$
and O$_3$ would be detectable using the Planetary Spectrum Generator. We find
that if exoEarths tend to be Earth-like, we expect to detect O$_3$ with a
LUVOIR-sized instrument. We also find that LUVOIR is unlikely to have a false
negative scenario in the context of searching for Earth-like life on its
targeted exoEarths. Because of that, if LUVOIR does not detect O$_2$ or O$_3$

convolutions is embedded into the LSTM structure. Through this, the temporal
information is preserved between and within windows. Since the hyper-parameters
of models require careful tuning, we also propose an automated prediction
framework based on the Bayesian optimization with hyperband optimizer, which
allows for efficient optimization of the network architecture. Finally, we show
the superiority of our proposed ECLSTM approach over the state-of-the-art
approaches on several widely used benchmark data sets for RUL Estimation.

features and temporal features to independent modules, and then associate
information from both dimensions. However, features from spatial and temporal
dimensions influence mutually, separated extractions isolate such dependencies,
and might lead to inaccurate results. In this paper, we incorporate the
perspective of information diffusion to model spatial features and temporal
features synchronously. Intuitively, vertices not only diffuse information to
the neighborhood but also to the subsequent state along with the temporal
dimension. Therefore, we can model such heterogeneous spatial-temporal
structures as a homogeneous process of diffusion. On this basis, we propose an
Iterative Spatial-Temporal Diffusion Graph Convolutional Network (ISTD-GCN) to
extract spatial and temporal features synchronously, thus dependencies between
both dimensions can be better modeled. Experiments on two traffic datasets
illustrate that our ISTD-GCN outperforms 10 baselines in traffic speed

the difference in the number of free parameters between the two nested models

structural equation models and random effects models, however, it is often

the regularity conditions of Wilks' theorem may be violated using three

slowed down by the presence of the distractor word. Various properties of the
distractor modulate this slow down, for example naming times are shorter with
frequent vs. infrequent distractors. Building on this line of research, the
present study investigates in more detail the impact of distractor and target
word properties on picture naming times. We report the results of several
Bayesian meta-analyses, based on 35 datasets. The aim of the first analysis was
to obtain an estimation of the size of the distractor frequency effect, and of
its precision, in typical picture-word interference experiments where this
variable is not manipulated. The analysis shows that a one-unit increase in log
frequency results in response times to the pictures decreasing by about 4ms
(95% Credible Interval: [-6, -2]). With the second and third analyses, we show
that after accounting for the effect of frequency, two variables known to
influence processing times in visual word processing tasks also influence
picture naming times: distractor length and orthographic neighborhood. Finally,
we found that distractor word frequency and target word frequency interact; the
effect of distractor frequency decreases as the frequency of the target word
increases. We discuss the theoretical and methodological implications of these
findings, as well as the importance of obtaining high-precision estimates of
experimental effects.

are briefly reviewed, before considering the posterior distribution for a

marginalising out the unknown cluster centres, and is different to the
likelihood associated with mixture models. The calculation is equivalent to
that used to obtain the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), but is exact,
without a Laplace approximation. The result includes a sum of squares term, and

renormalization is as large as 250 meV for MoS2 with model screening
corresponding to SiO2. Within the G0W0 approximation, we also find that the
inclusion of the effective screening induces a direct band gap, in contrast to
the unscreened monolayer. We also find that the dielectric screening induces an
enhancement of the carrier effective masses by as much as 27% for holes, shifts

moduli space of their geometric realizations in Euclidean spaces, using a
limiting procedure reminiscent of Floer homology. Given a labeled graph $G$ on
$n$ vertices and $d \geq 1$, $W_{G, d} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d \times n}$
denotes the space of nondegenerate realizations of $G$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$.The
set $W_{G, d}$ might not be connected, even when it is nonempty, and we refer
to its connected components as rigid isotopy classes of $G$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
We study the topology of these rigid isotopy classes. First, regarding the
connectivity of $W_{G, d}$, we generalize a result of Maehara that $W_{G, d}$
is nonempty for $d \geq n$ to show that $W_{G, d}$ is $k$-connected for $d \geq
n + k + 1$, and so $W_{G, \infty}$ is always contractible. While $\pi_k(W_{G,
d}) = 0$ for $G$, $k$ fixed and $d$ large enough, we also prove that, in spite
of this, when $d\to \infty$ the structure of the nonvanishing homology of
$W_{G, d}$ exhibits a stabilization phenomenon: it consists of $(n-1)$ equally
spaced clusters whose shape does not depend on $d$, for $d$ large enough. This
leads to the definition of a family of graph invariants, capturing this
structure. For instance, the sum of the Betti numbers of $W_{G,d}$ does not
depend on $d$, for $d$ large enough; we call this number the Floer number of
the graph $G$. Finally, we give asymptotic estimates on the number of rigid
isotopy classes of $\mathbb{R}^d$--geometric graphs on $n$ vertices for $d$
fixed and $n$ tending to infinity. When $d=1$ we show that asymptotically as
$n\to \infty$ each isomorphism class corresponds to a constant number of rigid
isotopy classes, on average. For $d>1$ we prove a similar statement at the
logarithmic scale.

loop antenna is shown to be efficiently harvested into bulk modes of the

within the medium have a well-resolved spatial-temporal separation owing to the

illustrate the computational advantages of the proposed approach.

measurements. First, we establish a resource theoretical framework to address
the coherence of measurement and show that any statistical distance can be
adopted to define a coherence monotone of measurement. For instance, the
relative entropy fulfills all the required properties as a proper monotone. We
specifically introduce a coherence monotone of measurement in terms of
off-diagonal elements of Positive-Operator-Valued Measure (POVM) components.
This quantification provides a lower bound on the robustness of
measurement-coherence that has an operational meaning as the maximal advantage
over all incoherent measurements in state discrimination tasks. Finally, we
propose an experimental scheme to assess our quantification of
measurement-coherence and demonstrate it by performing an experiment using a
single qubit on IBM Q processor.

the generation of the open-circuit voltage that is much larger than the
bandgap, making it rather attractive in solar cells. However, the magnitude of
the PGE photocurrent is usually small, which severely hampers its practical
application. Here we propose a mechanism to largely enhance the PGE
photocurrent by mechanical strain based on the quantum transport simulations
for the two-dimensional nickel-phosphorene-nickel photodetector. Broadband PGE
photocurrent governed by the Cs noncentrosymmetry is generated at zero bias
under the illumination of linearly polarized light. The photocurrent depends
linearly on the device asymmetry, while nonlinearly on the optical absorption.
By applying the appropriate mechanical tension stress on the phosphorene, the
photocurrent can be substantially enhanced by up to 3 orders of magnitude,
which is primarily ascribed to the largely increased device asymmetry. The
change in the optical absorption in some cases can also play a critical role in
tuning the photocurrent due to the nonlinear dependence. Moreover, the
photocurrent can even be further enhanced by the mechanical bending, mainly
owing to the considerably enhanced device asymmetry. Our results reveal the
dependence of the PGE photocurrent on the device asymmetry and absorption in
transport process through a device, and also explore the potentials of the PGE
in the self-powered low-dimensional flexible optoelectronics.

these problems, evolutionary algorithms have been extensively used due to their
effectiveness and minimum design effort. However, for dynamic problems, extra
mechanisms are required on top of standard evolutionary algorithms. Among them,
diversity mechanisms have proven to be competitive in handling dynamism, and
recently, the use of neural networks have become popular for this purpose.
Considering the complexity of using neural networks in the process compared to
simple diversity mechanisms, we investigate whether they are competitive and
the possibility of integrating them to improve the results. However, for a fair
comparison, we need to consider the same time budget for each algorithm. Thus,
instead of the usual number of fitness evaluations as the measure for the
available time between changes, we use wall clock timing. The results show the
significance of the improvement when integrating the neural network and
diversity mechanisms depends on the type and the frequency of changes.
Moreover, we observe that for differential evolution, having a proper diversity

came the concept of cloud computing, where to some extent, the issue of massive

however, this has introduced further challenges among which, latency and energy

intelligence came the concept of the Fog. The availability of massive numbers
of storage and computational devices at the edge of the network, where some are
owned and deployed by the end-users themselves but most by service operators.
This means that cloud services are pushed further out from the core towards the
edge of the network, hence reduced latency is achieved. Fog nodes are massively
distributed in the network, some benefit from wired connections, and others are
connected via wireless links. The question of where to allocate services
remains an important task and requires extensive attention. This chapter
introduces and evaluates cloud fog architectures in 6G networks paying special

robots. Here the concept of programming by demonstration or imitation learning
is used for trajectory planning of manipulators mounted on small spacecraft.
For greater autonomy in future space missions and minimal human intervention
through ground control, a robot arm having 7-Degrees of Freedom (DoF) is
envisaged for carrying out multiple tasks like debris removal, on-orbit
servicing and assembly. Since actual hardware implementation of microgravity
environment is extremely expensive, the demonstration data for trajectory
learning is generated using a model predictive controller (MPC) in a physics
based simulator. The data is then encoded compactly by Probabilistic Movement
Primitives (ProMPs). This offline trajectory learning allows faster
reproductions and also avoids any computationally expensive optimizations after
deployment in a space environment. It is shown that the probabilistic
distribution can be used to generate trajectories to previously unseen
situations by conditioning the distribution. The motion of the robot (or
manipulator) arm induces reaction forces on the spacecraft hub and hence its
attitude changes prompting the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS)
to take large corrective action that drains energy out of the system. By having
a robot arm with redundant DoF helps in finding several possible trajectories
from the same start to the same target. This allows the ProMP trajectory
generator to sample out the trajectory which is obstacle free as well as having
minimal attitudinal disturbances thereby reducing the load on ADCS.

on techniques appropriate for compact (Jupiter sized) planets. Here we point
out that protoplanets born through Gravitational Instability (GI) may remain in
an initial pre-collapse phase for as long as the first $ 10^5-10^7$ years after
formation. These objects are hundreds of times larger than Jupiter and their
atmospheres are too cold ($T\sim$ tens of K) to emit in the NIR or H$\alpha$
via accretion shocks. However, it is possible that their dust emission can be
detected with ALMA, even around Class I and II protoplanetary discs. In this
paper we produce synthetic observations of these protoplanets. We find that
making a detection in a disc at 140 parsecs would require a few hundred minutes
of ALMA band 6 observation time. Protoplanets with masses of 3-5 $M_J$ have the
highest chance of being detected; less massive objects require unreasonably
long observation times (1000 minutes) while more massive ones collapse into
giant planets before $10^5$ years. We propose that high resolution surveys of
young ($10^5-10^6$ years), massive and face on discs offer the best chance for
observing protoplanets. Such a detection would help to place constraints on the
protoplanet mass spectrum, explain the turnover in the occurrence frequency of
gas giants with system metallicity and constrain the prevalence of GI as a

against GI as a common planet formation mechanism.

towards the possible role of new physics (NP) in $b \to c \tau \bar{\nu}$ and
$b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ decay channels. This in turn indicates that the same class
of NP as appeared in $b \to c \tau \bar{\nu}$, might also show up in other tree
level processes involving $b \to u \tau \bar{\nu}$ transition. Since these
charged current transitions are doubly Cabibbo suppressed, the NP contributions
could be significant enough leading to sizeable effects in some of the
observables. In this paper, we study the implications of the vector leptoquark
$U_1(3,1,2/3)$, which is one of the few scenarios that can simultaneously
explain the LFU violation signals both in the charged-current as well as
neutral-current sectors, on the semileptonic decays $B \to (\pi, \rho,
\omega)\tau \bar{\nu}$ and $B_s \to (K, K^*) \tau \bar{\nu}$. In particular, we
pay our attention to the branching fraction, lepton flavor non-universality
(LNU) observable, forward-backward asymmetry and the polarization asymmetry
parameters of these modes. We find substantial deviations in the branching
fractions as well as LNU observables of these decay modes due to the $U_1$
contributions, which can be probed by the currently running experiments LHCb
and Belle-II.

when applied on distance estimation for complex projection models such as in
fisheye and omnidirectional cameras. This paper introduces a novel multi-task
learning strategy to improve self-supervised monocular distance estimation on
fisheye and pinhole camera images. Our contribution to this work is threefold:
Firstly, we introduce a novel distance estimation network architecture using a
self-attention based encoder coupled with robust semantic feature guidance to
the decoder that can be trained in a one-stage fashion. Secondly, we integrate
a generalized robust loss function, which improves performance significantly
while removing the need for hyperparameter tuning with the reprojection loss.
Finally, we reduce the artifacts caused by dynamic objects violating static
world assumptions using a semantic masking strategy. We significantly improve
upon the RMSE of previous work on fisheye by 25% reduction in RMSE. As there is
little work on fisheye cameras, we evaluated the proposed method on KITTI using
a pinhole model. We achieved state-of-the-art performance among self-supervised
methods without requiring an external scale estimation.

range of applications. Because of the complex background, and high density,
most of the existing methods fail to accurately extract a road network that

introduce a new model to apply structured domain adaption for synthetic image

generative adversarial networks to minimize the difference between the source

and the discriminator attempts to distinguish them. We also propose a feature
pyramid network that improves the performance of the proposed model by
extracting effective features from all the layers of the network for describing
different scales objects. Indeed, a novel scale-wise architecture is introduced
to learn from the multi-level feature maps and improve the semantics of the
features. For optimization, the model is trained by a joint reconstruction loss
function, which minimizes the difference between the fake images and the real

the parametric representation introduced in earlier literature, which maps the

non-universal parameters. We focus on the quartic cumulant of the baryon
number, or baryon number susceptibility~$\chi_4^B$, which can be accessed
experimentally via net-proton fluctuation kurtosis measurements. It was
originally predicted, through universality arguments based on the {\em leading}
singular contribution, that $\chi_4^B$ and net-proton kurtosis should show a
specific non-monotonic behavior due to the critical point. In particular, when
following the freeze-out curve on the phase diagram by decreasing beam energy,
the kurtosis is expected to dip, and then peak, when the beam energy scan
passes close to the critical point. We study the effects of the non-universal
and thus far unknown parameters of the Ising-to-QCD mapping on the behavior
of~$\chi_4^B$. We find that, while the peak remains a solid feature, the
presence of the critical point does not necessarily cause a dip in $\chi_4^B$

recognition by backing off to shorter units or characters to construct words

often multiple segmentation variants are possible. Yet, many systems are
trained using only the most likely segmentation. Recent research suggests that
sampling subword segmentations during training acts as a regularizer for neural
machine translation and speech recognition models, leading to performance
improvements. In this work, we conduct a principled investigation on the
regularizing effect of the subword segmentation sampling method for a streaming

truly represented the dispersion of values in a historical compilation of two
cosmological parameters: the amplitude of mass fluctuations ($\sigma_8$) and
Hubble's constant ($H_0$) parameters in the standard cosmological model. For
this analysis, a chi-squared test was executed on a compiled list of past
measurements. It was found through analysis of the chi-squared ($\chi^2$)
values of the data that for $\sigma_8$ (60 data points measured between 1993
and 2019 and $\chi^2$ between 182.4 and 189.0) the associated probability Q is
extremely low, with $Q = 1.6 \times 10^{-15}$ for the weighted average and $Q =
8.8 \times 10^{-15}$ for the best linear fit of the data. This was also the
case for the $\chi^2$ values of $H_0$ (163 data points measured between 1976
and 2019 and $\chi^2$ between 480.1 and 575.7), where $Q = 1.8 \times 10^{-33}$
for the linear fit of the data and $Q = 1.0 \times 10^{-47}$ for the weighted
average of the data. The general conclusion was that the statistical error bars
associated with the observed parameter measurements have been underestimated or
the systematic errors were not properly taken into account in at least 20\% of
the measurements. The~fact that the underestimation of error bars for $H_0$ is

many-body. Here we perform molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations of an equimolar
mixture that is weakly polydisperse and additive. For the first time we study
the structural relaxation of this mixture in the supercooled-liquid regime.
From the simulations we determine the time- and temperature-dependent
scattering functions for a large range of wave vectors, as well as the
mean-square displacements of both particle species. We perform a detailed
analysis of the dynamics by comparing the MD results with the
first-principles-based idealized mode-coupling theory (MCT). To this end, we
employ two approaches: fits to the asymptotic predictions of the theory, and
fit-parameter-free binary MCT calculations based on static-structure-factor
input from the simulations. We find that many-body interactions of the Voronoi
mixture do not lead to strong qualitative differences relative to similar
analyses carried out for simple liquids with pair-wise interactions. For
instance, the fits give an exponent parameter $\lambda \approx 0.746$
comparable to typical values found for simple liquids, the wavevector
dependence of the Kohlrausch relaxation time is in good agreement with
literature results for polydisperse hard spheres, and the MCT calculations
based on static input overestimate the critical temperature, albeit only by a
factor of about 1.2. This overestimation appears to be weak relative to other
well-studied supercooled-liquid models such as the binary Kob--Andersen
Lennard-Jones mixture. Overall, the agreement between MCT and simulation
suggests that it is possible to predict several microscopic dynamic properties
with qualitative, and in some cases near-quantitative, accuracy based solely on
static two-point structural correlations, even though the system itself is
inherently governed by many-body interactions.

intermediate representation that has the benefits of increasing both the
interpretability and the accuracy of networks' decisions. Nonetheless, these

hence not directly suitable for motion forecasting. In this paper, we introduce
a novel monocular camera-only holistic end-to-end trajectory planning network
with a Bird-Eye-View (BEV) intermediate representation that comes in the form
of binary Occupancy Grid Maps (OGMs). To ease the prediction of OGMs in BEV
from camera images, we introduce a novel scheme where the OGMs are first
predicted as semantic masks in camera view and then warped in BEV using the
homography between the two planes. The key element allowing this transformation
to be applied to 3D objects such as vehicles, consists in predicting solely
their footprint in camera-view, hence respecting the flat world hypothesis
implied by the homography.

interacting with a helium-rich CSM. The majority of the SNe Ibn reported

hosts. Aims: We present the discovery and study of SN 2020bqj (ZTF20aalrqbu), a
SN Ibn with a long-duration peak plateau lasting 40 days and hosted by a faint
low-mass galaxy. We aim to explain its peculiar properties using an extensive
data set. Methods: We compare the evolution of SN 2020bqj with SNe Ibn from the
literature. We fit the bolometric and multi-band lightcurves with different
powering mechanism models. Results: The risetime, peak magnitude and spectral
features of SN 2020bqj are consistent with those of most SNe Ibn, but the SN is
a clear outlier based on its bright, long-lasting peak plateau and low host
mass. We show through modeling that the lightcurve can be powered predominantly
by shock heating from the interaction of the SN ejecta and a dense CSM. The
peculiar Type Ibn SN 2011hw is a close analog to SN 2020bqj, suggesting a
similar progenitor and CSM scenario. In this scenario a very massive progenitor
star in the transitional phase between a luminous blue variable and a compact
Wolf-Rayet star undergoes core-collapse, embedded in a dense helium-rich CSM
with an elevated opacity compared to normal SNe Ibn, due to the presence of
residual hydrogen. This scenario is consistent with the observed properties of
SN 2020bqj and the modeling results. Conclusions: SN 2020bqj is a compelling
example of a transitional SN Ibn/IIn based on not only its spectral features,
but also its lightcurve, host galaxy properties and the inferred progenitor
properties. The strong similarity with SN 2011hw suggests this subclass may be
the result of a progenitor in a stellar evolution phase that is distinct from
those of progenitors of regular SNe Ibn.

environments such as intensive care unit (ICU), real-time model serving is
equally if not more important than accuracy, because in ICU patient care is
simultaneously more urgent and more expensive. Clinical decisions and their
timeliness, therefore, directly affect both the patient outcome and the cost of
care. To make timely decisions, we argue the underlying serving system must be
latency-aware. To compound the challenge, health analytic applications often
require a combination of models instead of a single model, to better specialize
individual models for different targets, multi-modal data, different prediction
windows, and potentially personalized predictions. To address these challenges,
we propose HOLMES-an online model ensemble serving framework for healthcare
applications. HOLMES dynamically identifies the best performing set of models
to ensemble for highest accuracy, while also satisfying sub-second latency
constraints on end-to-end prediction. We demonstrate that HOLMES is able to
navigate the accuracy/latency tradeoff efficiently, compose the ensemble, and
serve the model ensemble pipeline, scaling to simultaneously streaming data
from 100 patients, each producing waveform data at 250~Hz. HOLMES outperforms
the conventional offline batch-processed inference for the same clinical task
in terms of accuracy and latency (by order of magnitude). HOLMES is tested on
risk prediction task on pediatric cardio ICU data with above 95% prediction
accuracy and sub-second latency on 64-bed simulation.

compact object is presented. The equations of time-dependent of fluid including
the Coriolis force along with the centrifugal and pressure gradient forces are
derived. In this research, it is assumed that angular momentum transport is due
to viscous turbulence and the {\alpha}-prescription is used for the kinematic
coefficient of viscosity. Moreover, the general relativistic effects are
neglected. In order to solve the equations, we have used a self-similar
solution. The solutions show that the behaviour of the physical quantities in a
dynamical ADAF is different from that for a steady accretion flow. Our results
indicate that the physical quantities are dependent of rotation parameter which
is defined as the ratio of the intrinsic angular velocity of the central body
to the angular velocity of disc. Also, the effect of rotation parameter on
these quantities is different for co and counter-rotating flows. The solution
shows that by increasing the rotation parameter a, inflow-outflow region
approaches the central object for co-rotating flow and moves outward for
counter-rotating flow. We find that when flow is fully advection dominated (f !
1), the entire gas has positive Bernoulli function. Also, we suggest that the
Bernoulli function becomes more positive when the effect of rotation on the
structure of disc decreases.

correlates with the luminosity as well as with other galactic disc properties.
A derived posterior probability distribution of $\rho_0 r_0$ shows that the
null hypothesis of constancy is rejected at a very high confidence level. These
results leave little room for the claimed universality of dark matter surface
density. Since MOND has strong prediction on the surface density

MOND predictions are violated by data. To strengthen the previous result, we
compared our results to another prediction of MOND (Milgrom 2005), the
existence of a maximum Newtonian dark matter acceleration in the halo. Also in
this case, MOND predictions are in contradiction with data. The dark matter
Newtonian acceleration correlates with all the previously presented galactic
disc properties, and data are distributed outside the bound predicted by

artifacts increased with fiducial size. For CT imaging, maximum contrast (2722

$0$ we flip it to state 1 with probability $p$ or we keep it in state $0$ with
probability $1-p$. If the site is in state $1$ we flip it to state 0 with
probability $1-p$ or we keep it in state $1$ with probability $p$. Even when
state 1 has a selective advantage (i.e. $p>1/2$) the Markov chain is quite
unlikely to approach the most fit allele (i.e. all 1's). In fact, randomness
(i.e. which site is picked for a possible mutation) and selection (i.e. the
value of $p$) balance each other out so that the number of $1$'s in the genome
converges to a Gaussian distribution centered around $Np$.

in which the presence of noise can deteriorate the image quality. To overcome
this limitation, in this paper a improved two-stage fuzzy filter is proposed
for filtering salt and pepper noise from the images. In the first-stage, the
pixels in the image are categorized as good or noisy based on adaptive
thresholding using type-2 fuzzy logic with exclusively two different membership
functions in the filter window. In the second-stage, the noisy pixels are
denoised using modified ordinary fuzzy logic in the respective filter window.
The proposed filter is validated on standard images with various noise levels.
The proposed filter removes the noise and preserves useful image
characteristics, i.e., edges and corners at higher noise level. The performance
of the proposed filter is compared with the various state-of-the-art methods in
terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio and computation time. To show the
effectiveness of filter statistical tests, i.e., Friedman test and
Bonferroni-Dunn (BD) test are also carried out which clearly ascertain that the
proposed filter outperforms in comparison of various filtering approaches.

generation of highly realistic images, raising concerns about their misuse for

increasingly challenging due to the significant reduction of underlying
artifacts and specific patterns. The absence of such traces can hinder
detection algorithms from identifying GAN-images and transferring knowledge to
identify other types of GAN-images as well. In this work, we present the
Transferable GAN-images Detection framework T-GD, a robust transferable
framework for an effective detection of GAN-images. T-GD is composed of a
teacher and a student model that can iteratively teach and evaluate each other
to improve the detection performance. First, we train the teacher model on the
source dataset and use it as a starting point for learning the target dataset.
To train the student model, we inject noise by mixing up the source and target
datasets, while constraining the weight variation to preserve the starting
point. Our approach is a self-training method, but distinguishes itself from
prior approaches by focusing on improving the transferability of GAN-image
detection. T-GD achieves high performance on the source dataset by overcoming
catastrophic forgetting and effectively detecting state-of-the-art GAN-images
with only a small volume of data without any metadata information.

CBF approaches are myopic in the sense that they solve an optimization problem
at each time step rather than over a long time horizon. This approach may allow
a system to get too close to the unsafe set where the optimization problem can

relaxation variables into the optimization problem; however, this compromises
convergence to the desired equilibrium point. To address these challenges, we
develop an approximate optimal approach to the safety-critical control problem
in which the cost of violating safety constraints is directly embedded within
the value function. We show that our method is capable of guaranteeing both

experience (QoE) for users without incurring more resources. This work revisits
an important yet often overlooked piece of the puzzle: what should the QoE
abstraction be? A QoE abstraction is a representation of application quality
that describes how decisions affect QoE. The conventional wisdom has relied on
developing hand-crafted quality metrics (e.g., video rebuffering events, web
page loading time) that are specialized to each application, content, and
setting. We argue that in many cases, it maybe fundamentally hard to capture a
user's perception of quality using a list of handcrafted metrics, and that
expanding the metric list may lead to unnecessary complexity in the QoE model
without a commensurate gain. Instead, we advocate for a new approach based on a
new QoE abstraction called visual rendering. Rather than a list of metrics, we
model the process of quality perception as a user watching a continuous ""video""
(visual rendering) of all the pixels on their screen. The key advantage of
visual rendering is that it captures the full experience of a user with the
same abstraction for all applications. This new abstraction opens new
opportunities (e.g., the possibility of end-to-end deep learning models that
infer QoE directly from a visual rendering) but it also gives rise to new
research challenges (e.g., how to emulate the effect on visual rendering of an
application decision). This paper makes the case for visual rendering as a
unifying abstraction for Internet QoE and outlines a new research agenda to
unleash its opportunities.

layered structure for composing these policies. Leveraging these insights, we

quantum information processing for measuring field quadrature values. In this
paper we explore the possibility of operating a conjugate homodyne detection
system in ""photon counting"" mode to implement discrete-variable (DV) quantum
key distribution (QKD) protocols. A conjugate homodyne detection system, which
consists of a beam splitter followed by two optical homodyne detectors, can
simultaneously measure a pair of conjugate quadratures X and P of the incoming
quantum state. In classical electrodynamics, X^2 + P^2 is proportional to the
energy (the photon number) of the input light. In quantum optics, X and P do
not commute and thus the above photon-number measurement is intrinsically
noisy. This suggests that a blind application of the standard security proof
could result pessimistic QKD performance. We overcome this obstacle by taking
advantage of two special features of the proposed detection scheme. First, the
fundamental detection noise associated with vacuum fluctuation cannot be
manipulated by an external adversary. Second, the ability to reconstruct the
photon number statistics at the receiver's end can place additional constraints
on possible attacks from the adversary. As an example, we study the security of
the BB84 QKD using conjugate homodyne detection and evaluate its performance
through numerical simulations. This study may open the door to a new family of
QKD protocols, in complementary to the well-established DV-QKD based on single
photon detection and CV-QKD based on coherent detection.

Liu and Mei (J. Funct. Anal. 2020) observed that the situation improves
remarkably for singular integrals with a symmetry assumption, so that a

condition for symmetrised paraproducts, and requiring in addition only the
usual replacement of uniform bounds by $R$-bounds in the case of general

local minimum during training. To address this, we consider knowledge
distillation, in which the existing DNNs are jointly trained with an auxiliary

receiver DNNs to additionally exploit lossless gradients, which is useful in
avoiding a poor local minimum. For the same number of feedback bits, our

= (C \cup S, E)$ and a positive weight for each client $c \in C$. The algorithm
must assign each client $c \in C$ to an adjacent server $s \in S$. The load of
a server is then the weighted sum of all the clients assigned to it, and the
goal is to compute an assignment that minimizes some function of the server
loads, typically either the maximum server load (i.e., the
$\ell_{\infty}$-norm) or the $\ell_p$-norm of the server loads.
  We study load balancing in the distributed setting. There are two existing
results in the CONGEST model. Czygrinow et al. [DISC 2012] showed a
2-approximation for unweighted clients with round-complexity $O(\Delta^5)$,
where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the input graph. Halld\'orsson et al.
[SPAA 2015] showed an $O(\log{n}/\log\log{n})$-approximation for unweighted
clients and $O(\log^2\!{n}/\log\log{n})$-approximation for weighted clients
with round-complexity polylog$(n)$.
  In this paper, we show the first distributed algorithms to compute an
$O(1)$-approximation to the load balancing problem in polylog$(n)$ rounds. In
the CONGEST model, we give an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm in polylog$(n)$
rounds for unweighted clients. For weighted clients, the approximation ratio is
$O(\log{n})$. In the less constrained LOCAL model, we give an
$O(1)$-approximation algorithm for weighted clients in polylog$(n)$ rounds.
  Our approach also has implications for the standard sequential setting in
which we obtain the first $O(1)$-approximation for this problem that runs in
near-linear time. A 2-approximation is already known, but it requires solving a
linear program and is hence much slower. Finally, we note that all of our
results simultaneously approximate all $\ell_p$-norms, including the
$\ell_{\infty}$-norm.

decrease in the dynamic aperture and/or energy acceptance. In this paper, to
increase these two quantities, a multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA) is

to a manually obtained solution this approach yields very good results.
However, it requires a long computation time. As a second approach, a surrogate

provide the evidence that mass transport within the drop can be described by a
purely diffusive process for some range of parameters for which the
buoyancy-driven convection is negligible. We are then able to extract from
these experiments the collective diffusion coefficient of the dispersion
$D(\varphi)$ over a wide concentration range $\varphi=0.24$-$0.5$, i.e. from
the liquid dispersed state to the solid glass regime, with a high accuracy. The

execution into a sequence of views, each with a designated leader process. The
key to guaranteeing liveness in these protocols is to ensure that all correct

reach a decision. We propose a simple view synchronizer abstraction that
encapsulates the corresponding functionality for Byzantine consensus protocols,
thus simplifying their design. We present a formal specification of a view
synchronizer and its implementation under partial synchrony, which runs in
bounded space despite tolerating message loss during asynchronous periods. We
show that our synchronizer specification is strong enough to guarantee liveness
for single-shot versions of several well-known Byzantine consensus protocols,
including HotStuff, Tendermint, PBFT and SBFT. We furthermore give precise
latency bounds for these protocols when using our synchronizer. By factoring
out the functionality of view synchronization we are able to specify and
analyze the protocols in a uniform framework, which allows comparing them and

recovery processes, for which hydrocarbon components are vaporized under high
temperatures, move downstream in the gas phase and condense back to the liquid
phase. To reduce the computational cost, it is standard practice to reduce the
number of (pseudo-)components used in thermal reservoir simulation. Depending
on the number and type of hydrocarbon pseudo-components retained in the
simulations, we may not be able to capture the correct displacement due to
large errors in the lumped phase behavior (flash) computations. We address that
problem through a multi-level method: we use data obtained from a short
simulation using the most detailed fluid description available, and leverage
that information to guide a delumping process. We use temperature as a proxy
variable for composition, and select reference temperatures. We extract the
corresponding reference compositions from the detailed run and use them to
extend the lumped pseudo-components to an approximate detailed composition. We
test our method using six heavy oil samples, and under two different recovery
processes: hot nitrogen injection and in-situ combustion (air injection and
exothermic oxidation reactions). The average error on the liquid mole fraction
is reduced by 4-12 times (depending on the oil samples) compared to the flash
using pseudo-components, and the maximum error by 6-48 times. We illustrate
that the method is amenable to manually adding more information about the
physics of some oil samples. We also discuss how to efficiently pick the
reference temperatures. For uniformly sampled temperatures (between a minimum
and maximum temperature), we conduct a sensitivity study which led us to use
six temperatures. We ran both local (Pattern Search, PS) and global (Particle
Swarm Optimization, PSO) gradient-free optimization methods.

Pulsations
are formulated for stellar radius and temperature using spherical harmonic
functions with different values of l,m. The characteristics of the microlensing
light curves from NRP stars are investigated in relation to different pulsation
modes. For the microlensing of NRP stars, the light curve is not a simple
multiplication of the magnification curve and the intrinsic luminosity curve of
the source star, unless the effect of finite source size can be ignored. Three
main conclusions can be drawn from the simulated light curves. First, for modes
with $m\neq0$ and when the viewing inclination is more nearly pole-on, the
stellar luminosity towards the observer changes little with pulsation phase. In
this case, high-magnification microlensing events are chromatic and can reveal
the variability of these source stars. Second, some combinations of pulsation
modes produce nearly degenerate luminosity curves (e.g., (l,m)=(3,0), (5,0)).
The resulting microlensing light curves are also degenerate, unless the lens
crosses the projected source. Finally, for modes involving m=1, the stellar
brightness centre does not coincide with the coordinate centre, and the
projected source brightness centre moves in the sky with pulsation phase. As a
result of this time-dependent displacement in the brightness centroid, the time
of the magnification peak coincides with the closest approach of the lens to
the brightness centre as opposed to the source coordinate centre. Binary
microlensing of NRP stars and in caustic-crossing features are chromatic.

We present a large-scale empirical study to understand developers' SV
discussions and how these discussions are being supported by Q&A sites. Method:
We first curate 71,329 SV posts from two large Q&A sites, namely Stack Overflow
(SO) and Security StackExchange (SSE). We then use topic modeling to uncover
the topics of SV-related discussions and analyze the popularity, difficulty,
and level of expertise for each topic. We also perform a qualitative analysis
to identify the types of solutions to SV-related questions. Results: We
identify 13 main SV discussion topics on Q&A sites. Many topics do not follow
the distributions and trends in expert-based security sources such as Common
Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).
We also discover that SV discussions attract more experts to answer than many
other domains, but some difficult SV topics (e.g., Vulnerability Scanning
Tools) still receive quite limited support from experts. Moreover, we identify
seven key types of answers given to SV questions on Q&A sites, in which SO
often provides code and instructions, while SSE usually gives experience-based
advice and explanations. Conclusion: Our findings provide support for

fixed $q \in (0, 1)$, we study a Gaussian analytic function (GAF) and its zero
set which defines a point process on ${\mathbb{A}}_q$ called the zero point
process of the GAF. The GAF is defined by the i.i.d.~Gaussian Laurent series
such that the covariance kernel parameterized by $r >0$ is identified with the
weighted Szeg\H{o} kernel of ${\mathbb{A}}_q$ with the weight parameter $r$
studied by Mccullough and Shen. The GAF and the zero point process are
rotationally invariant and have a symmetry associated with the $q$-inversion of
coordinate $z \leftrightarrow q/z$ and the parameter change $r \leftrightarrow
q^2/r$. When $r=q$ they are invariant under conformal transformations which
preserve ${\mathbb{A}}_q$. Conditioning the GAF by adding zeros, new GAFs are
induced such that the covariance kernels are also given by the weighted
Szeg\H{o} kernel of Mccullough and Shen but the weight parameter $r$ is changed
depending on the added zeros.
  We also prove that the zero point process of the GAF provides a
permanental-determinantal point process (PDPP) in which each correlation
function is expressed by a permanent multiplied by a determinant. Dependence on
$r$ of the unfolded 2-correlation function of the PDPP is studied. If we take
the limit $q \to 0$, a simpler but still non-trivial PDPP is obtained on the
unit disk ${\mathbb{D}}$. We observe that the limit PDPP indexed by $r \in (0,
\infty)$ can be regarded as an interpolation between the determinantal point
process (DPP) on ${\mathbb{D}}$ studied by Peres and Vir\'ag ($r \to 0$) and
that DPP of Peres and Vir\'ag with a deterministic zero added at the origin ($r
\to \infty$).

  Bidirectional Modeling","11 pages, 5 figures, Neurocomputing",,,,"cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN) is a natural and general
representation of data in recommender systems. Combining HIN and recommender
systems can not only help model user behaviors but also make the recommendation
results explainable by aligning the users/items with various types of entities
in the network. Over the past few years, path-based reasoning models have shown
great capacity in HIN-based recommendation. The basic idea of these models is
to explore HIN with predefined path schemes. Despite their effectiveness, these
models are often confronted with the following limitations: (1) Most prior
path-based reasoning models only consider the influence of the predecessors on
the subsequent nodes when modeling the sequences, and ignore the reciprocity
between the nodes in a path; (2) The weights of nodes in the same path instance
are usually assumed to be constant, whereas varied weights of nodes can bring
more flexibility and lead to expressive modeling; (3) User-item interactions
are noisy, but they are often indiscriminately exploited. To overcome the
aforementioned issues, in this paper, we propose a novel path-based reasoning
approach for recommendation over HIN. Concretely, we use a bidirectional LSTM
to enable the two-way modeling of paths and capture the reciprocity between
nodes. Then an attention mechanism is employed to learn the dynamical influence
of nodes in different contexts. Finally, the adversarial regularization terms
are imposed on the loss function of the model to mitigate the effects of noise
and enhance HIN-based recommendation. Extensive experiments conducted on three
public datasets show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.
The case study further demonstrates the feasibility of our model on the
explainable recommendation task.

difference and small azimuthal angle difference, often referred to as the
``ridge signal'', is a phenomenon widely observed in high multiplicity
proton-proton, proton-ion and deutron-ion collisions, which is not yet fully
understood. In heavy-ion collisions, the hydrodynamic expansion of the
Quark-Gluon Plasma is one of the possible explanations of the origin of the
ridge signal. Measurements in the $e^+e^-$ collision system, without the
complexities introduced by hadron structure in the initial state, can serve as
a complementary probe to examine the formation of a ridge signal. The first
measurement of two-particle angular correlation functions in high multiplicity
$e^+e^-$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=10.52$ GeV is reported. The hadronic $e^+e^-$
annihilation data collected by the Belle detector at KEKB are used in this
study. Two-particle angular correlation functions are measured over the full
azimuth and large pseudorapidity intervals which are defined by either the
electron beam axis or the event thrust as a function of charged particle
multiplicity. The measurement in the event thrust analysis, with mostly
outgoing quark pairs determining the reference axis, is sensitive to the region
of additional soft gluon emissions. No significant ridge signal is observed
with either coordinates analyses. Near side jet correlations appear to be
absent in the thrust axis analysis. The measurements are compared to
predictions from various event generators and expected to provide new
constraints to the phenomenological models in the low energy regime.

to deal with the inherent ambiguity of natural language. Previous research
usually requires either the user to describe all the characteristics of the

work, we propose a novel unsupervised approach, based on image-to-image
translation, that alters the attributes of a given image through a command-like

state-of-the-art approaches, our model does not require a human-annotated

but only those that have to be modified. Our proposed model disentangles the
image content from the visual attributes, and it learns to modify the latter
using the textual description, before generating a new image from the content
and the modified attribute representation. Because text might be inherently
ambiguous (blond hair may refer to different shadows of blond, e.g. golden,
icy, sandy), our method generates multiple stochastic versions of the same
translation. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves promising
performances on two large-scale public datasets: CelebA and CUB. We believe our

also find that the liquid-gas phase transition in these porous materials is of
second order nature near capillary critical temperature, which is shown to
represent a true critical temperature, i.e. independent of the degree of
disorder and the nature of solid matrix, discrete or continuous. The critical

of gravity play important roles. In particular, huge gauge redundancies of a
gravitational theory at the nonperturbative level, which are much larger than
the standard diffeomorphism and relate even spaces with different topologies,
allow us to take different descriptions of a system. While the physical
conclusions are the same in any description, the same physics may manifest
itself in vastly different forms in descriptions based on different gauge
choices.
  In this paper, we explore the relation between two such descriptions, which
we refer to as the global gauge and unitary gauge constructions. The former is
based on the global spacetime of general relativity, in which understanding
unitarity requires the inclusion of subtle nonperturbative effects of gravity.
The latter is based on a distant view of the black hole, in which unitarity is
manifest but the existence of interior spacetime is obscured. These two
descriptions are complementary. In this paper, we initiate the study of
learning aspects of one construction through the analysis of the other.
  We find that the existence of near empty interior spacetime manifest in the
global gauge construction is related to the maximally chaotic, fast scrambling,
and universal dynamics of the horizon in the unitary gauge construction. We use
the complementarity of the gauge choices to understand the ensemble nature of
the gravitational path integral in global spacetime in terms of coarse graining
and thermality in a single unitary theory that does not involve any ensemble
nature at the fundamental level. We also discuss how the interior degrees of
freedom are related with those in the exterior in the two constructions. This
relation emerges most naturally as entanglement wedge reconstruction and the
effective theory of the interior in the respective constructions.

pairs, ~30% in the cold classical population between $a_\text{hel}$~39 and ~48
AU. Observationally, these binaries generally have components of similar size
and colour. Previous work has shown that gravitational collapse of a pebble
cloud is an efficient mechanism for producing such systems. Since the discovery
of the bi-lobate nature of Arrokoth there is also interest in gravitational
collapse as a way to form contact binaries.
  Aims. Our aim was to investigate formation of binary systems via
gravitational collapse, considering a wider range of binary masses than
previous studies. We analysed in detail the properties of the bound systems
that are formed and compared them to observations.
  Methods. We performed N-body simulations of gravitational collapse of a
pebble cloud using the REBOUND package, with an integrator designed for
rotating reference frames and robust collision detection. We conducted a deep
search for gravitationally bound particles at the end of the gravitational
collapse phase and tested their stability. For all systems produced, not just
the most massive binaries, we investigated the population characteristics of
their mass and orbital parameters. Gravitational collapse can create binary
systems analogous to Arrokoth and collisions in a collapsing cloud should be
gentle enough to preserve a bi-lobed structure.
  Results. Gravitational collapse is an efficient producer of bound
planetesimal systems. On average ~1.5 bound systems were produced per cloud in

found that gravitational collapse produces massive bodies with small satellites

knocked out from $^2$H and $^{12}$C via the $A(e,e'\vec p\,)$ reaction. We have
studied the dependence of $\vec P$ on two kinematic variables: the missing
momentum $p_{\rm miss}$ and the ""off-coplanarity"" angle $\phi_{pq}$ between the
scattering and reaction planes. For the full 360$\degree$ range in $\phi_{pq}$,
both the normal ($P_y$) and, for the first time, the transverse ($P_x$)
components of the induced polarization were measured with respect to the
coordinate system associated with the scattering plane. $P_x$ vanishes in
coplanar kinematics, however in non-coplanar kinematics, it is on the same
scale as $P_y$.
  We find that the dependence on $\phi_{pq}$ is sine-like for $P_x$ and
cosine-like for $P_y$. For carbon, the magnitude of the induced polarization is
especially large when protons are knocked out from the $p_{3/2}$ shell at very
small $p_{\rm miss}$. For the deuteron, the induced polarization is near zero
at small $|p_{\rm miss}|$, and its magnitude increases with $|p_{\rm miss}|$.
For both nuclei such behavior is reproduced qualitatively by theoretical
results, driven largely by the spin-orbit part of the final-state interactions.
However, for both nuclei, sizeable discrepancies exist between experiment and
theory.

the Green Bank Northern Celestial Cap (GBNCC) Pulsar Survey conducted with the
Green Bank Telescope at 350 MHz. FRB 20200125A was detected at a Galactic
latitude of 58.43 degrees with a dispersion measure of 179 pc cm$^{-3}$, while
electron density models predict a maximum Galactic contribution of 25 pc
cm$^{-3}$ along this line of sight. Moreover, no apparent Galactic foreground
sources of ionized gas that could account for the excess DM are visible in
multi-wavelength surveys of this region. This argues that the source is
extragalactic. The maximum redshift for the host galaxy is $z_{max}=0.17$,
corresponding to a maximum comoving distance of approximately 750 Mpc. The
measured peak flux density for FRB 20200125A is 0.37 Jy, and we measure a pulse
width of 3.7 ms, consistent with the distribution of FRB widths observed at
higher frequencies. Based on this detection and assuming an Euclidean flux
density distribution of FRBs, we calculate an all-sky rate at 350 MHz of
$3.4^{+15.4}_{-3.3} \times 10^3$ FRBs sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a peak flux
density of 0.42 Jy for an unscattered pulse having an intrinsic width of 5 ms,
consistent with rates reported at higher frequencies. Given the recent
improvements in our single-pulse search pipeline, we also revisit the GBNCC
survey sensitivity to various burst properties. Finally, we find no evidence of
interstellar scattering in FRB 20200125A, adding to the growing evidence that
some FRBs have circumburst environments where free-free absorption and
scattering are not significant.

models the exhaled breath as a cloud which is emitted through the room

accounting for partial absorption and reflection at each side of the room. The
paper first derives a closed form expression of the temporal-spatial virus

air sampler and a bio-sensor to detect the viral existence of a specific virus.
We, therefore, assess the detection capabilities of the proposed system via
evaluating the viral miss-detection probability as a function of the sampling
volume and the detection time-instance at the receiver side. Our numerical
simulations verify the validity of the analytical results, and illustrate the
ability of the proposed system to detect viruses in indoor environments. The
results further characterize the impacts of several system parameters on the

Canonical projections of unit spheres are special generic. In suitable cases,
it is easy to construct special generic maps on manifolds represented as
connected sums of products of spheres for example. It is an interesting fact
that these maps restrict the topologies and the differentiable structures
admitting them strictly in various cases. For example, exotic spheres, which
are not diffeomorphic to standard spheres, admit no special generic map into
some Euclidean spaces in considerable cases.
  In general, it is difficult to find (families of) manifolds admitting no such

where key objects are products of cohomology classes of the manifolds. We can
see that manifolds such as closed symplectic manifolds and real projective

reproducibility in MR image reconstruction in the context of a challenge.
Participants had to recreate the results of ""Advances in sensitivity encoding
with arbitrary k-space trajectories"" by Pruessmann et al.
  Methods: The task of the challenge was to reconstruct radially acquired
multi-coil k-space data (brain/heart) following the method in the original
paper, reproducing its key figures. Results were compared to consolidated
reference implementations created after the challenge, accounting for the two
most common programming languages used in the submissions (Matlab/Python).
  Results: Visually, differences between submissions were small. Pixel-wise
differences originated from image orientation, assumed field-of-view or
resolution. The reference implementations were in good agreement, both visually
and in terms of image similarity metrics.
  Discussion and Conclusion: While the description level of the published
algorithm enabled participants to reproduce CG-SENSE in general, details of the
implementation varied, e.g., density compensation or Tikhonov regularization.
Implicit assumptions about the data lead to further differences, emphasizing
the importance of sufficient meta-data accompanying open data sets. Defining
reproducibility quantitatively turned out to be non-trivial for this image
reconstruction challenge, in the absence of ground-truth results. Typical
similarity measures like NMSE of SSIM were misled by image intensity scaling
and outlier pixels. Thus, to facilitate reproducibility, researchers are
encouraged to publish code and data alongside the original paper. Future
methodological papers on MR image reconstruction might benefit from the
consolidated reference implementations of CG-SENSE presented here, as a
benchmark for methods comparison.

It is
essentially inefficient infrastructure use which results in increased vehicle

businesses. Addressing this issue is therefore of paramount interest due to the
perceived dual benefit. Many technologies were and are being developed. These
include adaptive traffic signals, dedicated lanes, etc. This paper presents a
simple platooning algorithm that maintains relatively small distances
(pre-specified time gap) between consecutive vehicles to enhance mobility,
increase transportation capacity and ultimately reduce travel costs. Several
dynamic and kinematic constraints governing the motion of vehicles are also
accounted for. These include acceleration, velocity, and distance constraints.
This developed logic was tested on highways that traverse the downtown area of
Los Angeles. Depending on the market penetration rate of connected automated
vehicles versus non-connected automated vehicles, a reduction in travel time,
delay and fuel consumed across the city can be observed. Vehicles are expected
to reach their destination in less travel time, delay and consumed fuel. The

  Learning with Multi-blockchain Framework",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The emerging Federated Edge Learning (FEL) technique has drawn considerable
attention, which not only ensures good machine learning performance but also
solves ""data island"" problems caused by data privacy concerns. However,
large-scale FEL still faces following crucial challenges: (i) there lacks a
secure and communication-efficient model training scheme for FEL; (2) there is
no scalable and flexible FEL framework for updating local models and global
model sharing (trading) management. To bridge the gaps, we first propose a
blockchain-empowered secure FEL system with a hierarchical blockchain framework
consisting of a main chain and subchains. This framework can achieve scalable
and flexible decentralized FEL by individually manage local model updates or
model sharing records for performance isolation. A Proof-of-Verifying consensus
scheme is then designed to remove low-quality model updates and manage
qualified model updates in a decentralized and secure manner, thereby achieving
secure FEL. To improve communication efficiency of the blockchain-empowered
FEL, a gradient compression scheme is designed to generate sparse but important
gradients to reduce communication overhead without compromising accuracy, and
also further strengthen privacy preservation of training data. The security
analysis and numerical results indicate that the proposed schemes can achieve
secure, scalable, and communication-efficient decentralized FEL.

wireless communications including 5G and especially 6G. It consists of a large
2D array of (semi-)passive scattering elements that control the electromagnetic
properties of radio-frequency waves so that the reflected signals add
coherently at the intended receiver or destructively to reduce co-channel
interference. The promised gains of IRS-assisted communications depend on the
accuracy of the channel state information. In this paper, we address the
receiver design for an IRS-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
communication system via a tensor modeling approach aiming at the channel
estimation problem using supervised (pilot-assisted) methods. Considering a
structured time-domain pattern of pilots and IRS phase shifts, we present two
channel estimation methods that rely on a parallel factor (PARAFAC) tensor
modeling of the received signals. The first one has a closed-form solution
based on a Khatri-Rao factorization of the cascaded MIMO channel, by solving
rank-1 matrix approximation problems, while the second one is an iterative
alternating estimation scheme. The common feature of both methods is the
decoupling of the estimates of the involved MIMO channel matrices (base
station-IRS and IRS-user terminal), which provides performance enhancements in
comparison to competing methods that are based on unstructured LS estimates of
the cascaded channel. Design recommendations for both methods that guide the
choice of the system parameters are discussed. Numerical results show the
effectiveness of the proposed receivers, highlight the involved trade-offs, and
corroborate their superior performance compared to competing LS-based
solutions.

Markov decision processes (MDP) with uncountable (continuous) state and action
spaces. While there are algorithms that, for special classes of such MDP,
provide a sequence of approximations converging to the true value in the limit,
our aim is to obtain an algorithm with guarantees on the precision of the
approximation. As this problem is undecidable in general, assumptions on the
MDP are necessary. Our main contribution is to identify sufficient assumptions
that are as weak as possible, thus approaching the ""boundary"" of which systems

our assumptions is necessary for algorithms based on processing finitely many

  We present two solution variants. The first one provides converging lower
bounds under weaker assumptions than typical ones from previous works concerned
with guarantees. The second one then utilizes stronger assumptions to
additionally provide converging upper bounds. Altogether, we obtain an anytime
algorithm, i.e. yielding a sequence of approximants with known and iteratively
improving precision, converging to the true value in the limit. Besides, due to
the generality of our assumptions, our algorithms are very general templates,
readily allowing for various heuristics from literature in contrast to, e.g., a

which degenerates their feature backbones in revealing semantic information.
However, given an image, we tend to pay more attention to those regions which
are semantically salient even in the case that these regions are perceptually

problem into two sequential tasks: 1) we propose a lightweight, weakly

from multiple sources (USA FACTS, Southeast Texas Regional Advisory Council
COVID 19 report, TMC daily news, and New York Times county level mortality
reporting). Our model, risk stratified SIR HCD uses separate variables to model
the dynamics of local contact (e.g., work from home) and high contact (e.g.,
work on site) subpopulations while sharing parameters to control their
respective $R_0(t)$ over time. Results: We evaluated our models forecasting
performance in Harris County, TX (the most populated county in the Greater
Houston area) during the Phase I and Phase II reopening. Not only did our model
outperform other competing models, it also supports counterfactual analysis to
simulate the impact of future policies in a local setting, which is unique
among existing approaches. Discussion: Local mortality and hospitalization are
significantly impacted by quarantine and reopening policies. No existing model
has directly accounted for the effect of these policies on local trends in
infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in an explicit and explainable manner.
Our work is an attempt to close this important technical gap to support
decision making. Conclusion: Despite several limitations, we think it is a
timely effort to rethink about how to best model the dynamics of pandemics
under the influence of reopening policies.

  the Impact of Institutions",,,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting the impact of research institutions is an important tool for
decision makers, such as resource allocation for funding bodies. Despite
significant effort of adopting quantitative indicators to measure the impact of
research institutions, little is known that how the impact of institutions
evolves in time. Previous researches have focused on using the historical
relevance scores of different institutions to predict potential future impact
for these institutions. In this paper, we explore the factors that can drive
the changes of the impact of institutions, finding that the impact of an
institution, as measured by the number of the accepted papers of the
institution, more is determined by the authors' influence of the institution.
Geographic location of institution feature and state GDP can drive the changes
of the impact of institutions. Identifying these features allows us to
formulate a predictive model that integrates the effects of individual ability,
location of institution, and state GDP. The model unveils the underlying
factors driving the future impact of institutions, which can be used to
accurately predict the future impact of institutions.

society. The complexity of research topics in social science makes it the
amalgamation of multiple disciplines, such as economics, political science, and
sociology, etc. For centuries, scientists have conducted many studies to
understand the mechanisms of the society. However, due to the limitations of
traditional research methods, there exist many critical social issues to be
explored. To solve those issues, computational social science emerges due to
the rapid advancements of computation technologies and the profound studies on
social science. With the aids of the advanced research techniques, various
kinds of data from diverse areas can be acquired nowadays, and they can help us
look into social problems with a new eye. As a result, utilizing various data
to reveal issues derived from computational social science area has attracted
more and more attentions. In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we
present a survey on data-driven computational social science for the first time
which primarily focuses on reviewing application domains involving human
dynamics. The state-of-the-art research on human dynamics is reviewed from
three aspects: individuals, relationships, and collectives. Specifically, the
research methodologies used to address research challenges in aforementioned
application domains are summarized. In addition, some important open challenges
with respect to both emerging research topics and research methods are
discussed.

they support e-commerce applications and different research communities.
Recommender systems have a large number of applications in many fields
including economic, education, and scientific research. Different empirical
studies have shown that recommender systems are more effective and reliable
than keyword-based search engines for extracting useful knowledge from massive
amounts of data. The problem of recommending similar scientific articles in
scientific community is called scientific paper recommendation. Scientific
paper recommendation aims to recommend new articles or classical articles that
match researchers' interests. It has become an attractive area of study since
the number of scholarly papers increases exponentially. In this survey, we
first introduce the importance and advantages of paper recommender systems.
Second, we review the recommendation algorithms and methods, such as
Content-Based methods, Collaborative Filtering methods, Graph-Based methods and
Hybrid methods. Then, we introduce the evaluation methods of different
recommender systems. Finally, we summarize open issues in the paper recommender
systems, including cold start, sparsity, scalability, privacy, serendipity and
unified scholarly data standards. The purpose of this survey is to provide
comprehensive reviews on scholarly paper recommendation.

services is limited to empirical studies that lack real-time spatial contexts.
To fill this gap, we took a novel real-time geospatial analysis approach. With
source data on ride-hailing trips in Chicago, Illinois, we computed real-time
transit-equivalent trips for all 7,949,902 ride-hailing trips in June 2019; the
sheer size of our sample is incomparable to the samples studied in existing
literature. An existing Multinomial Nested Logit Model was used to determine
the probability of a ride-hailer selecting a transit alternative to serve the
specific O-D pair, P(Transit|CTA). We find that 31% of ride-hailing trips are
replaceable, whereas 61% of trips are not replaceable. The remaining 8% lie
within a buffer zone. We measured the robustness of this probability using a
parametric sensitivity analysis and performed a two-tailed t-test. Our results
indicate that of the four sensitivity parameters, the probability was most
sensitive to the total travel time of a transit trip. The main contribution of
our research is our thorough approach and fine-tuned series of real-time
spatiotemporal analyses that investigate the replaceability of ride-hailing
trips for public transit. The results and discussion intend to provide
perspective derived from real trips and we anticipate that this paper will
demonstrate the research benefits associated with the recording and release of
ride-hailing data.

  Electric Vehicles","Paper submitted to Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.MA cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper develops and investigates the impacts of multi-objective Nash
optimum (user equilibrium) traffic assignment on a large-scale network for
battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and internal combustion engine vehicles
(ICEVs) in a microscopic traffic simulation environment. Eco-routing is a
technique that finds the most energy efficient route. ICEV and BEV energy
consumption patterns are significantly different with regard to their
sensitivity to driving cycles. Unlike ICEVs, BEVs are more energy efficient on
low-speed arterial trips compared to highway trips. Different energy
consumption patterns require different eco-routing strategies for ICEVs and
BEVs. This study found that eco-routing could reduce energy consumption for
BEVs but also significantly increases their average travel time. The simulation
study found that multi-objective routing could reduce the energy consumption of
BEVs by 13.5, 14.2, 12.9, and 10.7 percent, as well as the fuel consumption of
ICEVs by 0.1, 4.3, 3.4, and 10.6 percent for ""not congested"", ""slightly
congested"", ""moderately congested"", and ""highly congested"" conditions,
respectively. The study also found that multi-objective user equilibrium
routing reduced the average vehicle travel time by up to 10.1% compared to the
standard user equilibrium traffic assignment for the highly congested
conditions, producing a solution closer to the system optimum traffic
assignment. The results indicate that the multi-objective eco-routing can
effectively reduce fuel/energy consumption with minimum impacts on travel times
for both BEVs and ICEVs.
