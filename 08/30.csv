We unexpectedly find that the long-time diffusion constant describing cell

end-users lack appropriate behaviour , i.e., reluctance or lack of
understanding to adopt security practices, compromising health-critical data

mHealth providers should ensure security training of end-users (e.g., threat

for security vs usability). The study provides empirical evidence and a set of

enlarged lymph node (LN), GTV$_{LN}$ also includes smaller ones if associated
with high positron emission tomography signals and/or any metastasis signs in
CT. This is a daunting task. In this work, we propose a unified LN appearance
and inter-LN relationship learning framework to detect the true GTV$_{LN}$.
This is motivated by the prior clinical knowledge that LNs form a connected
lymphatic system, and the spread of cancer cells among LNs often follows
certain pathways. Specifically, we first utilize a 3D convolutional neural
network with ROI-pooling to extract the GTV$_{LN}$'s instance-wise appearance
features. Next, we introduce a graph neural network to further model the
inter-LN relationships where the global LN-tumor spatial priors are included in
the learning process. This leads to an end-to-end trainable network to detect
by classifying GTV$_{LN}$. We operate our model on a set of GTV$_{LN}$
candidates generated by a preliminary 1st-stage method, which has a sensitivity
of $>85\%$ at the cost of high false positive (FP) ($>15$ FPs per patient). We
validate our approach on a radiotherapy dataset with 142 paired PET/RTCT scans

biological systems. A RS pairs a set of entities with a set of reactions over
them. Entities can be used to enable or inhibit each reaction, and are produced
by reactions. Entities can also be provided by an external context. RS
semantics is defined in terms of an (unlabelled) rewrite system: given the
current set of entities, a rewrite step consists of the application of all and
only the enabled reactions. In this paper we define, for the first time, a
labelled transition system for RSs in the structural operational semantics
(SOS) style. This is achieved by distilling a signature whose operators
directly correspond to the ingredients of RSs and by defining some simple SOS
inference rules for any such operator to define the behaviour of the RS in a
compositional way. The rich information recorded in the labels allows us to
define an assertion language to tailor behavioural equivalences on some
specific properties or entities. The SOS approach is suited to drive additional
enhancements of RSs along features such as quantitative measurements of
entities and communication between RSs. The SOS rules have been also exploited
to design a prototype implementation in logic programming.

twenty-two ensembles on a $24^3\times 48$ lattice to percent level in
statistical accuracy. The finite-volume effects for these ensemble are at the
sub-percent level. From these measurements we produce easy-to-use
parameterizations to help tune simulations with this action. The lattice
spacing is fixed using a mass-independent procedure, by matching observables in
the chiral limit. We also provide a parameterization for the chiral
extrapolation which is universal and should hold for all discretizations of
$N_f=2$ QCD.

transferring semantic label maps to photo-realistic images. Existing methods
lack effective semantic constraints to preserve the semantic information and
ignore the structural correlations in both spatial and channel dimensions,
leading to unsatisfactory blurry and artifact-prone results. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel Dual Attention GAN (DAGAN) to synthesize
photo-realistic and semantically-consistent images with fine details from the
input layouts without imposing extra training overhead or modifying the network
architectures of existing methods. We also propose two novel modules, i.e.,
position-wise Spatial Attention Module (SAM) and scale-wise Channel Attention
Module (CAM), to capture semantic structure attention in spatial and channel
dimensions, respectively. Specifically, SAM selectively correlates the pixels
at each position by a spatial attention map, leading to pixels with the same
semantic label being related to each other regardless of their spatial
distances. Meanwhile, CAM selectively emphasizes the scale-wise features at
each channel by a channel attention map, which integrates associated features
among all channel maps regardless of their scales. We finally sum the outputs
of SAM and CAM to further improve feature representation. Extensive experiments
on four challenging datasets show that DAGAN achieves remarkably better results
than state-of-the-art methods, while using fewer model parameters. The source

false vacuum energy density is the remnant from a primeval inflationary stage.
The zero temperature scalar field potential is here described by an even power
series up to order six which depends on 3 free parameters: the mass of the
scalar field ($m$), the dimensionless ($\lambda$) specifying the standard
self-interaction term, and a free cutoff mass scale ($M$) quantifying all
possible deviations from the degenerate false vacuum state. The current
$\Lambda$CDM model is a consequence of the very long decay time of the false
vacuum which although finite is much greater than the current age of the
Universe. This result remains valid for arbitrary combinations of the $m/M$
ratio which can analytically be determined in the thin-wall approximation and
numerically calculated outside this limit. Unlike many claims in the literature
the vacuum dominance may be temporary. The finiteness of the decay time
suggests that the ultimate stage of the observed Universe in such a scenario
will not be driven by a de Sitter type cosmology.

other types of events, often obey heavy-tailed distributions, and their impacts
on collective dynamics on networks such as contagion processes have been
intensively studied. The literature supports that such heavy-tailed
distributions are present for inter-event times associated with both individual
nodes and individual edges in networks. However, the simultaneous presence of
heavy-tailed distributions of inter-event times for nodes and edges is a
non-trivial phenomenon, and its origin has been elusive. In the present study,
we propose a generative model and its variants to explain this phenomenon. We
assume that each node independently transits between a high-activity and
low-activity state according to a continuous-time two-state Markov process and
that, for the main model, events on an edge occur at a high rate if and only if
both end nodes of the edge are in the high-activity state. In other words, two
nodes interact frequently only when both nodes prefer to interact with others.
The model produces distributions of inter-event times for both individual nodes
and edges that resemble heavy-tailed distributions across some scales. It also
produces positive correlation in consecutive inter-event times, which is
another stylized observation for empirical data of human activity. We expect
that our modeling framework provides a useful benchmark for investigating
dynamics on temporal networks driven by non-Poissonian event sequences.

multiple transitions, giving more diverse diffusion phases with respect to

coverage trajectory, the vehicle has to return to the charging station for a

algorithm enables the vehicle to retreat back to the charging station based on
the remaining energy which is monitored throughout the coverage process. This
is followed by an advance trajectory that takes the vehicle to a near by
unexplored waypoint to restart the coverage process, instead of taking it back

severe losses because it can be bounded for any alternative.
  A necessary condition for drastic power loss to occur is that the Hermitian
of the reduced-form covariance matrix has eigenvalues of opposite signs. These

set since they assume that the selected action is a deterministic function of
firing rate of neurons, which is continuous. In this paper, we propose a new
STDP-based learning rule for spiking neuron networks which contains feedback
modulation. We show that the STDP-based learning rule can be used to solve
reinforcement learning tasks with discrete action set at a speed similar to
standard reinforcement learning algorithms when applied to the CartPole and
LunarLander tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that the agent is unable to solve
these tasks if feedback modulation is omitted from the learning rule. We
conclude that feedback modulation allows better credit assignment when only the
units contributing to the executed action and TD error participate in learning.

aerosol chemical deposition reactors have gathered attention for their
promising applications. Densification of these pristine films provides an
important way to manipulate the mechanical, electronic, and optical properties.
To elucidate the underlying microstructural level restructuring, which is
ultimately responsible for the change in properties, we perform large scale
vector-based mesoscopic distinct element method simulations in conjunction with
electron microscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry characterization of pristine
and densified films by drop-cast volatile liquid processing. Matching the
microscopy observations, pristine CNT films with finite thickness are modeled
as self-assembled CNT networks comprising entangled dendritic bundles with
branches extending down to individual CNTs. Simulations of the film under
uniaxial compression uncover an ultra-soft densification regime extending to a
~75% strain, which is likely accessible with the surface tensional forces
arising from liquid surface tension during the evaporation. When removing the
loads, the pre-compressed samples evolve into homogeneously densified films
with thickness values depending on both the pre-compression level and the
sample microstructure. The significant reduction in thickness, confirmed by our
spectroscopic ellipsometry, is attributed to the underlying structural changes
occurring at the 100 nm scale, including the zipping of the thinnest dendritic
branches.

small flat octupolar molecules at the low-concentration limit, aiming towards
nonlinear-optical (NLO) applications at room temperatures. The octupoles
interact with external electric poling fields and intermolecular interactions
are neglected. Simple statistical-mechanics models are used to analyze the
orientational order in the very weak poling limit, sufficient for retrieving
the NLO signals owing to the high sensitivity of NLO detectors and measurement
chains. Two scenarios are discussed. Firstly, the octupolar poling field is
imparted by a system of point charges; the setup is subject to cell-related
constraints imposed by mechanical strength and dielectric breakdown limit. The
very weak octupolar order of benchmarking TATB molecules is shown to emerge at
Helium temperatures. The second scenario addresses the dipoling of octupolar
molecules with a small admixture of electric dipolar component. It requires a
strong field regime to become effective at Nitrogen temperature range. An
estimation of the nonlinear susceptibility coefficient matrix for both
scenarios is done in the high-temperature (weak interaction) limit formalism.
We argue that moderate modifications of the system like, e.g., an increase of
the size of the octupole, accompanied by dipole-assisted octupoling, can
increase the poling temperature above Nitrogen temperatures.

extract quantitative high-level information describing the micro-environment of
glomeruli in consecutive whole slide images (WSIs) processed with different
staining modalities of patients with chronic kidney rejection after kidney
transplantation. Methods: This four-step framework consists of: 1) approximate
rigid registration, 2) cell and anatomical structure segmentation 3) fusion of
information from different stainings using a newly developed registration
algorithm 4) feature extraction. Results: Each step of the framework is
validated independently both quantitatively and qualitatively by pathologists.
An illustration of the different types of features that can be extracted is
presented. Conclusion: The proposed generic framework allows for the analysis
of the micro-environment surrounding large structures that can be segmented
(either manually or automatically). It is independent of the segmentation
approach and is therefore applicable to a variety of biomedical research
questions. Significance: Chronic tissue remodelling processes after kidney
transplantation can result in interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy (IFTA)

in the same spatial context, information from different consecutive WSIs and
help researchers understand the complex underlying mechanisms leading to IFTA

with robust magnetism and ultra-low damping has opened new avenues for
exploration. Specifically, thin-films of vanadium tetracyanoethylene (V[TCNE]x)
can be patterned into the multiple, connected structures needed for hybrid

anisotropy, and the recovery of a magnetic resonance linewidth at 5 K that is
comparable to room-temperature values (roughly 2 G at 9.4 GHz). We can account
for these variations of the V[TCNE]x linewidth within the context of scattering
from very dilute paramagnetic impurities, and anticipate additional linewidth
narrowing as the temperature is further reduced.

is important to deal with the recovery of the system after these situations.
This paper deals with the problem of recovering a manufacturing system, modeled
as a Discrete Event System (DES) using the Supervisory Control Theory (SCT),
when the control structure, called supervisor, desynchronizes from the physical
plant. The desynchronization may be seen as plant and supervisor being in
uncorresponding states. The recovery of the system may be attained if there is
a word, the synchronizing word, that regardless the state of each one of them,
brings the system and supervisor back to a known state. The concepts of
synchronizing automata are used to do so. In this paper we show under what
conditions a set of synchronizing plants and specifications leads to a
synchronizing supervisor obtained by the Supervisory Control Theory. The
problem is extended to cope with multiple supervisors, proposing a local
recovery when possible. We also present a simple way to model problems,
composed of machines and buffers, as synchronizing automata such that it is
always possible do restore synchronization between the control (supervisor) and
the plant.

inferential issues when the model output and observational data are
high-dimensional dependent data such as large time series due to the difficulty
in building an emulator and the non-identifiability between effects from input

a new calibration framework based on a deep neural network (DNN) with
long-short term memory layers that directly emulates the inverse relationship

discrepancy on input parameter inference. We also formulate a new way to
construct interval predictions for DNN using quantile regression to quantify
the uncertainty in input parameter estimates. Through a simulation study and

direction measurement provides a two-dimensional constraint, it has been widely
accepted that at least two non-parallel reference directions should be

attitude completely. This paper uncovers an intriguing fact that the attitude
can actually be estimated by using multiple measurements of a single, fixed
reference direction, provided that the angular velocity and the direction
measurements are resolved in appropriate frames, respectively. More
specifically, after recognizing that the attitude uncertainties propagated over
the left-trivialized stochastic kinematics are distinct from those over the
right-trivialized one, stochastic attitude observability with single direction

tail radiation for a compact, static, spherically symmetric weak-field (i.e.
low density) mass distribution that is well off the line-of-sight (LOS) between
a source and an observer, and that is coupled to the radiation only
gravitationally. For such perturbers, there are four distinct epochs in the
observed radiation: the light-cone piece; the subsequent early-time tail --
ending at the first time that a signal moving at the speed of light could
travel from the source to a point in the perturber thence to the observer; the
subsequent middle-time tail; and the late-time tail, beginning at the last time
that a signal could make such a journey. For massless scalar and vector (eg.
electromagnetic radiation), we revisit the previously studied early and
late-time tail, and perform the first full examination of the middle-time tail.
Studying shorter wavelengths and generic perturbers well off the LOS, we find
that the late-time tail carries a small fraction of the energy received by the
observer; however, the total middle-time tail contains much more energy. We
also note that whereas the middle-time tail appears to the observer to emanate
from the perturber -- as one might expect for radiation ""scattered"" from the
gravitational perturbation -- the late-time tail appears to come back from the
source. We speculate on the potential utility of this middle-time tail for
detecting or probing a wide variety of perturbations to the spacetime geometry
including dark matter candidates and dark matter halos.

if every non-invertible element factors into irreducibles. We begin by
determining when $\mathbb{N}_0[\alpha]$ is atomic, and we give an explicit
description of its set of irreducibles. An atomic monoid is a finite
factorization monoid (FFM) if every element has only finitely many
factorizations (up to order and associates), and it is a bounded factorization
monoid (BFM) if for every element there is a bound for the number of
irreducibles (counting repetitions) in each of its factorizations. We show
that, for the monoid $\mathbb{N}_0[\alpha]$, the property of being a BFM and
the property of being an FFM are equivalent to the ascending chain condition on
principal ideals (ACCP). Finally, we give various characterizations for
$\mathbb{N}_0[\alpha]$ to be a unique factorization monoid (UFM), two of them

packing density. For higher dimensions, we use a bound from probability theory
to estimate the error probability for some well-known lattices. Our
investigations suggest that for uniform distributions, the error probability
becomes large with the dimension of the lattice, for lattices with good packing
densities. We also consider the case where $\mathbf{X}$ is obtained by adding
Gaussian noise to a randomly chosen lattice point. In this case, the error

well as many more types of networked interactions between elements. When the
relative abundances of types can be measured well, we further observe
heavy-tailed categorical distributions for type frequencies. For the comparison
of type frequency distributions of two systems or a system with itself at
different time points in time -- a facet of allotaxonometry -- a great range of
probability divergences are available. Here, we introduce and explore
`probability-turbulence divergence', a tunable, straightforward, and
interpretable instrument for comparing normalizable categorical frequency
distributions. We model probability-turbulence divergence (PTD) after
rank-turbulence divergence (RTD). While probability-turbulence divergence is
more limited in application than rank-turbulence divergence, it is more
sensitive to changes in type frequency. We build allotaxonographs to display
probability turbulence, incorporating a way to visually accommodate zero
probabilities for `exclusive types' which are types that appear in only one
system. We explore comparisons of example distributions taken from literature,
social media, and ecology. We show how probability-turbulence divergence either
explicitly or functionally generalizes many existing kinds of distances and
measures, including, as special cases, $L^{(p)}$ norms, the S{\o}rensen-Dice
coefficient (the $F_1$ statistic), and the Hellinger distance. We discuss
similarities with the generalized entropies of R{\'e}nyi and Tsallis, and the

as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem, with each incoming lane
representing an independent variable; b) dynamic vehicle selection: build a
directed graph with result of the optimization, and reserve only some of the
vehicle nodes to coordinate by applying a subset extraction algorithm; c)
synchronous velocity profile planning: bridge the gap between current speed and
optimal velocity in a synchronous manner. The problem size is essentially
bounded by number of lanes instead of vehicles. Thus the optimization process
is realtime with guaranteed solution quality. Simulation has verified
efficiency and real-time performance of the scheme.

in the energy market, either for speculation or hedging. However, it is hard to
price, especially the one with the arithmetic average price. The traditional
trading procedure is either too restrictive by assuming the distribution of the
underlying asset or less rigorous by using the approximation. It is attractive
to infer the Asian option price with few assumptions of the underlying asset
distribution and adopt to the historical data with a nonparametric method. In
this paper, we present a novel approach to price the Asian option from an
imprecise statistical aspect. Nonparametric Predictive Inference (NPI) is
applied to infer the average value of the future underlying asset price, which
attempts to make the prediction reflecting more uncertainty because of the
limited information. A rational pairwise trading criterion is also proposed in
this paper for the Asian options comparison, as a risk measure. The NPI method
for the Asian option is illustrated in several examples by using the simulation

conditions for the equilibrium point together with conditions for limit cycles
using the delay $\tau$ as bifurcation parameter are obtained. Under the
assumptions that the use of observers, estimators or extra laboratory
measurements are avoided to prevent the rise of computational or monetary
costs, for the purpose of control, we will only consider the measurement of the
biomass. A simple controller that can be employed is the proportional action
controller $u(t)=k_px(t)$, which is shown to fail to stabilize the obtained
model under the proposed analysis. Another suitable choice is the use of a
delayed controller $u(t)=k_rx(t-h)$ which successfully stabilizes the model

blindly increasing the depth of the network, we are committed to mining image
features and learning the inter-scale correlation between different upsampling

which achieves great performance with fewer parameters and less execution time.
MDCN consists of multi-scale dense cross blocks (MDCBs), hierarchical feature
distillation block (HFDB), and dynamic reconstruction block (DRB). Among them,
MDCB aims to detect multi-scale features and maximize the use of image features
flow at different scales, HFDB focuses on adaptively recalibrate channel-wise
feature responses to achieve feature distillation, and DRB attempts to
reconstruct SR images with different upsampling factors in a single model. It
is worth noting that all these modules can run independently. It means that
these modules can be selectively plugged into any CNN model to improve model
performance. Extensive experiments show that MDCN achieves competitive results
in SISR, especially in the reconstruction task with multiple upsampling

statistically significant difference in the distribution of the scaling

electric current density, and current helicity. The flaring HARPs tend to show
higher values of the scaling exponent compared to those of the flare-quiet

MPR has been previously established, most of the previous studies only focus on
the measurement at room temperature. The MPR has not been well studied for
measurements of bulk and coating materials at high temperatures, which are
increasingly important for a multitude of applications, such as materials used
in the concentrating solar power (CSP) plants and the nuclear reactors. MPR is
a non-contact technique that utilizes the intrinsic thermal emission from the
specimens for thermometry, which is favorable for measurements at high
temperatures in harsh environment. The authors designed and utilized a sample
holder suitable for high temperature measurement up to 973 K with good
temperature uniformity within the sample. The high-temperature MPR setup was
validated by measuring bulk materials with known thermal conductivity. The
setup and technique were then extended to the measurement of black
solar-absorbing coatings of 10 to 50 {\mu}m thick on various substrates by
modulating the frequency of the laser heating beam and the thermal penetration
depth. The studies showed that thermal conductivities of typical
solar-absorbing coatings are 0.4 ~ 0.8 W m-1 K-1, indicating a possibly large
temperature drop within the coating under high solar irradiation flux, such as

for narrowband Gaussian signals is proposed. Rather than taking the direct
Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach for joint estimation of all the unknown model
parameters, which leads to a multi-dimensional optimization problem with no
closed-form solution, we revisit Paulraj and Kailath's (P-K's) classical
approach in exploiting the special (Toeplitz) structure of the observations'
covariance. However, we offer a substantial improvement over P-K's ordinary
Least Squares (LS) estimates by using asymptotic approximations in order to
obtain simple, non-iterative, (quasi-)linear Optimally-Weighted LS (OWLS)
estimates of the sensors gains and phases offsets with asymptotically optimal
weighting, based only on the empirical covariance matrix of the measurements.
Moreover, we prove that our resulting estimates are also asymptotically optimal
w.r.t. the raw data, and can therefore be deemed equivalent to the ML Estimates
(MLE), which are otherwise obtained by joint ML estimation of all the unknown
model parameters. After deriving computationally convenient expressions of the
respective Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds, we also show that our estimates offer
improved performance when applied to non-Gaussian signals (and/or noise) as
quasi-MLE in a similar setting. The optimal performance of our estimates is
demonstrated in simulation experiments, with a considerable improvement
(reaching an order of magnitude and more) in the resulting mean squared errors
w.r.t. P-K's ordinary LS estimates. We also demonstrate the improved accuracy
in a multiple-sources directions-of-arrivals estimation task.

triggering in face-on spiral galaxies using a volume-limited sample with $0.02
< z < 0.055$, $M_r < 19.5$, and $\sigma > 70 \rm ms s^{-1}$ selected from SDSS
Data Release 7. To separate their possible entangled effects, we divide the
sample into bar and non-bar sample, and each sample is further divided into
three environment cases of isolated galaxies, interacting galaxies with a pair,
and cluster galaxies. The isolated case is used as a control sample. For these
six cases, we measure AGN fractions at a fixed central star formation rate and
central velocity dispersion, $\sigma$. We demonstrate that the internal process
of the bar-induced gas inflow is more efficient in AGN triggering than the
external mechanism of the galaxy interactions in groups and cluster outskirts.
The significant effects of bar instability and galaxy environments are found in
galaxies with a relatively less massive bulge. We conclude that from the
perspective of AGN-galaxy co-evolution, a massive black hole is one of the key
drivers of spiral galaxy evolution. If it is not met, a bar instability helps
the evolution, and in the absence of bars, galaxy interactions/mergers become
important. In other words, in the presence of a massive central engine, the
role of the two gas inflow mechanisms is reduced or almost disappears. We also
find that bars in massive galaxies are very decisive in increasing AGN
fractions when the host galaxies are inside clusters.

driven (Floquet) systems under high-frequency drives. In closed systems, it
dictates that their stroboscopic dynamics under a time-periodic Hamiltonian is
well captured by the FM expansion, which gives a static effective Hamiltonian.
On the other hand, in dissipative systems driven by a time-periodic
Liouvillian, it remains an important and nontrivial problem whether the FM
expansion gives a static Liouvillian describing continuous-time Markovian
dynamics, which we refer to as the Liouvillianity of the FM expansion. We
answer this question for generic systems with local interactions. We find that,
while noninteracting systems can either break or preserve Liouvillianity of the
FM expansion, generic few-body and many-body interacting systems break it under
any finite drive, which is essentially caused by propagation of interactions
via higher order terms of the FM expansion. Liouvillianity breaking implies
that Markovian dissipative Floquet systems in the high-frequency regimes do not
have static (Markovian) counterparts, giving a signature of emergent
non-Markovianity. Our theory provides a useful insight for questing unique
phenomena in dissipative Floquet systems.

extensively investigated to improve the response to rotation. However, the
highly resultant dimensionality in the eigenstate space causing from the

great response at EPs requires strict implementation conditions. To solve this
problem, a new non-Hermitian structure was proposed that realizes an
exceptional surface (EP surface) constructed of numerous EPs embedded in a
high-dimensional parameter space. With respect to the isolated EPs,
non-Hermitian EP surface provides additional degrees of freedom to permit the
undesired perturbations (such as fabrication errors) shifts along the EP
surface which corresponds to the robustness. On the other hand, the rotation
will force the system away from these EPs obtaining a sensitivity enhancement
of three orders of magnitude, compared to the traditional Sagnac effect

flexible model-dependent optical depth method to study EBL by fitting the
emission spectra of TeV BL Lacs objects via a one-zone leptonic synchrotron
self-Compton model (SSC). We have little information about electron energy
distributions (EEDs) in the jet, which is critically important to build
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in SSC scenario. Based on the current
particle acceleration models, we use two types of EEDs, i,e., a power-law
log-parabola (PLLP) EED and a broken power-law (BPL) EED to fit the observed
spectra. We obtain that the upper limits of EBL density are around about 30 n W
m$^{-2}$ sr$^{-1}$, which are similar to the published measurement.
Furthermore, we propose an unprecedented method to test radiation mechanisms
involved in TeV objects by simply comparing the reduced EBL density with the
limit obtained by galaxy counts, and demonstrate that for some BL Lacs, at

the discriminator to learn meaningful feature representations which are often

bosons are shown. A duality to the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with isospin is
exhibited, provided that the isovector pseudoscalar mean field is constrained
to a plane in isospin space. This enables us to find the phase diagram as a
function of temperature, chemical potential and isospin chemical potential as
well as twisted kinks. A bare mass term acts quite differently when added to
this model as compared to other chiral variants of the Gross-Neveu model.

building prediction models which ensure fairness at the most individual level.
Rather than globally considering equity over the entire population, the idea is
to imagine what any individual would look like with a variation of a given
attribute of interest, such as a different gender or race for instance.
Existing approaches rely on Variational Auto-encoding of individuals, using
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) penalization to limit the statistical dependence
of inferred representations with their corresponding sensitive attributes. This
enables the simulation of counterfactual samples used for training the target
fair model, the goal being to produce similar outcomes for every alternate
version of any individual. In this work, we propose to rely on an adversarial
neural learning approach, that enables more powerful inference than with MMD
penalties, and is particularly better fitted for the continuous setting, where
values of sensitive attributes cannot be exhaustively enumerated. Experiments
show significant improvements in term of counterfactual fairness for both the

an approximate way of decomposing the discretized BUX into components of each

using the three-body model with core excitation

constructed by the particle-rotor model and the reaction part is described by

an alternative approach for decomposing discretized BUXs into components in

about the causal interpretation of classical statistical estimands. In

subdistribution hazards, are fundamentally hard to be interpret causally.
Estimands on the risk scale, such as contrasts of cumulative incidence

significant role in interpreting and analyzing the nonstationary signal
constituted of various modes. However, it is difficult for most previous
methods to handle signal modes with closely-spaced or spectrally-overlapped
instantaneous frequencies (IFs) especially in adverse environments. To address
this issue, we propose an enhanced TFR and mode decomposition (ETFR-MD) method,
which is particularly adapted to represent and decompose multi-mode signals
with close or crossing IFs under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.
The emphasis of the proposed ETFR-MD is placed on accurate IF and instantaneous
amplitude (IA) extraction of each signal mode based on short-time Fourier
transform (STFT). First, we design an initial IF estimation method specifically
for the cases involving crossing IFs. Further, a low-complexity mode
enhancement scheme is proposed so that enhanced IFs better fit underlying IF
laws. Finally, the IA extraction from signal's STFT coefficients combined with
the enhanced IFs enables us to reconstruct each signal mode. In addition, we
derive mathematical expressions that reveal optimal window lengths and
separation interference of our method. The proposed ETFR-MD is compatible with
previous related methods, thus can be regarded as a step toward a more general
time-frequency representation and decomposition method. Experimental results
confirm the superior performance of the ETFR-MD when compared to a
state-of-the-art benchmark.

The downsides to this approach are that it does not give worst-case privacy
guarantees, and that finding optimal sanitisation protocols can be
computationally prohibitive. We tackle these problems by using differential
privacy metrics, and by considering local protocols which operate on one entry
at a time. We show that under both the Local Differential Privacy and Local
Information Privacy leakage metrics, one can efficiently obtain optimal
protocols. Furthermore, Local Information Privacy is both more closely aligned
to the privacy requirements of the Privacy Funnel scenario, and more
efficiently computable. We also consider the scenario where each user has
multiple attributes, for which we define Side-channel Resistant Local
Information Privacy, and we give efficient methods to find protocols satisfying
this criterion while still offering good utility. Finally, we introduce
Conditional Reporting, an explicit LIP protocol that can be used when the
optimal protocol is infeasible to compute, and we test this protocol on
real-world and synthetic data. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data

The selection process involves estimating the red-sequence redshifts, assessing
the purity of the sample, and estimating the underlying redshift distributions
of redshift bins. After performing the selection, we mitigate the impact of
survey properties on the observed number density of galaxies by assigning
photometric weights to the galaxies. We measure the angular two-point

pre-existing non-spherically symmetric circumstellar medium (CSM) in their
light curves, spectral line profiles, and polarization signatures. To better
understand the connection with binary stars and to aid in the interpretation of
observations, we perform two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations
where an expanding spherical SN ejecta initialized with realistic density and
velocity profiles collide with various aspherical CSM distributions. We
consider CSM in the form of a circumstellar disk, colliding wind shells in
binary stars with different orientations and distances from the SN progenitor,
and bipolar lobes representing a scaled down version of the Homunculus nebula
of $\eta$~Car. We study how our simulations map onto observables, including
approximate light curves, indicative spectral line profiles at late times, and
estimates of polarization signature. We find that the SN--CSM collision layer
is composed of normal and oblique shocks, reflected waves, and other
hydrodynamical phenomena that lead to acceleration and shear instabilities. As
a result, the total shock heating power fluctuates in time, although the
emerging light curve might be smooth if the shock interaction region is deeply
embedded in the SN envelope. SNe with circumstellar disks or bipolar lobes
exhibit late-time spectral line profiles symmetric with respect to the rest
velocity and relatively high polarization. In contrast, SNe with colliding wind
shells naturally lead to line profiles with asymmetric and time-evolving blue
and red wings and low polarization. Given the high frequency of binaries among
massive stars, interaction of SN ejecta with a pre-existing colliding wind
shell must occur and the observed signatures could be used to characterize the
binary companion.

known beneficial properties of the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method.
Furthermore, many studies have demonstrated the superconvergence property
(order of $2k+1$ in the negative norm) of the semi-discrete DG method. One can
take advantage of this superconvergence property by post-processing techniques
to enhance the accuracy of the DG solution. A popular class of post-processing
techniques to raise the convergence rate from order $k+1$ to order $2k+1$ in
the $L^2$ norm is the Smoothness-Increasing Accuracy-Conserving (SIAC)
filtering. In addition to enhancing the accuracy, the SIAC filtering also
increases the inter-element smoothness of the DG solution. The SIAC filtering
was introduced for the DG method of the linear hyperbolic equation by Cockburn
et al. in 2003. Since then, there are many generalizations of the SIAC
filtering have been proposed. However, the development of SIAC filtering has
never gone beyond the framework of using spline functions (mostly B-splines) to
construct the filter function. In this paper, we first investigate the general
basis function (beyond the spline functions) that can be used to construct the
SIAC filter. The studies of the general basis function relax the SIAC filter
structure and provide more specific properties, such as extra smoothness, etc.
Secondly, we study the basis functions' distribution and propose a new SIAC
filter called compact SIAC filter that significantly reduces the original SIAC
filter's support size while preserving (or even improving) its ability to
enhance the accuracy of the DG solution. We show that the proofs of the new
SIAC filters' ability to extract the superconvergence and provide numerical
results to confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the new finding's

nonlinearity, linear damping, and nonlinear damping, is studied. To begin with,
the authors examine the dynamics of an AO. Due to this symmetric nature, the
system has two neutrally stable elliptic equilibrium points in positive and
negative potential-wells. Hence, the unforced system can exhibit both
single-well and double-well periodic oscillations depending on the initial
conditions. Next, the authors include nonlinear damping into the system. Then,
the symmetry of the system is broken instantly and the stability of the two
elliptic points is altered to result in stable focus and unstable focus in the
positive and negative potential-wells, respectively. Consequently, the system
is dual-natured and is either non-dissipative or dissipative, depending on
location in the phase space. Furthermore, when one includes a periodic external
forcing with suitable parameter values into the nonlinearly damped AO system
and starts to increase the damping strength, the symmetry of the system is not
broken right away, but it occurs after the damping reaches a threshold value.
As a result, the system undergoes a transition from double-well chaotic
oscillations to single-well chaos mediated through extreme events (EEs).
Furthermore, it is found that the large-amplitude oscillations developed in the
system are completely eliminated if one incorporates linear damping into the
system. The numerically calculated results are in good agreement with the
theoretically obtained results on the basis of Melnikov's function. Further, it
is demonstrated that when one includes linear damping into the system, this
system has a dissipative nature throughout the entire phase space of the
system. This is believed to be the key to the elimination of EEs.

similarity is a crucial step towards a clearer picture of human action
perception from a learning and developmental perspective. In the present work,
we investigate to which extent a computational model based on kinematics can
determine action similarity and how its performance relates to human similarity
judgments of the same actions. To this aim, twelve participants perform an
action similarity task, and their performances are compared to that of a
computational model solving the same task. The chosen model has its roots in
developmental robotics and performs action classification based on learned
kinematic primitives. The comparative experiment results show that both the
model and human participants can reliably identify whether two actions are the
same or not. However, the model produces more false hits and has a greater
selection bias than human participants. A possible reason for this is the
particular sensitivity of the model towards kinematic primitives of the
presented actions. In a second experiment, human participants' performance on
an action identification task indicated that they relied solely on kinematic
information rather than on action semantics. The results show that both the
model and human performance are highly accurate in an action similarity task
based on kinematic-level features, which can provide an essential basis for
classifying human actions.

determined by the total gravitational potential of the universe, the scalar
field $\phi=1/G$ in the Jordan-Brans-Dicke (JBD) theory is introduced as
evolving with the inverse square of the scale factor. Since the gravitational
potential is related to the field $\phi$ resulting from Mach's principle and
depends on time due to the expansion of space, the temporal evolution of the
field should be in accord with the evolution of time and space intervals in the
metric tensor. For the same reason, the time dependence of the field makes
these comoving intervals relative for different points on the time axis. Thus,
it is shown that introduction of the cosmic gravitational potential as a time
dependent scalar field proportional to $1/a^2$ may resolve the flatness, the
horizon and the late-time accelerating expansion problems of the standard model
of cosmology. The luminosity distance vs redshift data of Type Ia supernovae is
in agreement with this approach.

academic interest, because these superstorms can cause catastrophic impact on
the modern civilisation due to our increasing dependency on technological

considered as a benchmark of observational history owing to its magnetic
disturbance and equatorial extent of the auroral oval. So far, several recent
auroral reports at that time have been published but those reports are mainly
derived from the Northern Hemisphere. In this study, we analyse datable auroral
reports from South America and its vicinity, assess the auroral extent using
philological and astrometric approaches, identify the auroral visibility at -
17.3{\deg} magnetic latitude and further poleward and reconstruct the
equatorial boundary of the auroral oval to be 25.1{\deg} +/- 0.5{\deg} in
invariant latitude. Interestingly, brighter and more colourful auroral displays
were reported in the South American sector than in the Northern Hemisphere.
This north-south asymmetry is presumably associated with variations of their
magnetic longitude and the weaker magnetic field over South America compared to
the magnetic conjugate point and the increased amount of magnetospheric
electron precipitation into the upper atmosphere. These results attest that the
magnitude of the Carrington storm indicates that its extent falls within the
range of other superstorms, such as those that occurred in May 1921 and
February 1872, in terms of the equatorial boundary of the auroral oval.

obtained without modified commutation relations. While existing models
introduce modified phase space volumes for the canonical degrees of freedom, we
introduce new degrees of freedom for the background geometry. The phase space
is therefore enlarged but remains Euclidean. The spatial background is treated
as a genuinely quantum object, with an associated state vector, and the model
naturally gives rise to the extended generalised uncertainty principle (EGUP).
Importantly, this approach solves (or rather, evades) well known problems
associated with modified commutators, including violation of the equivalence
principle, the `soccer ball' problem for multiparticle states, and the velocity
dependence of the minimum length. However, it implies two radical conclusions.
The first is that space must be quantised on a different scale to matter and
the second is that the fundamental quanta of geometry are fermions. We explain
how, in the context of the model, these do not contradict established results
including the no go theorems for multiple quantisation constants, which still
hold for species of material particles, and the spin-$2$ nature of gravitons.

Casimir-Polder interaction (RCPI). It is well known that, for a linearly
accelerated system coupled with a massless scalar field, we get a thermal
response when the local inertial approximation is valid. On the contrary, the
non-thermality arises in the presence of the centripetal acceleration. We use
the quantum master equation formalism to calculate the second-order energy
shift of the entangled states in the presence of two kinds of fields. They are
the massive free scalar field and the electromagnetic vector field. For both
cases, we observe the non-thermal behavior. A unique retarded response is also
noticed in comparison to the free massless case, which can be observed via the

ground of the valley Hall effect (VHE) in two-dimensional materials? The
original VHE emerges in samples with ballistic transport of electrons due to
the anomalous velocity terms resulting from the Berry phase effect. In
disordered samples though, alternative mechanisms associated with electron
scattering off impurities have been suggested: (i) asymmetric electron
scattering, called skew scattering, and (ii) a shift of the electron wave
packet in real space, called a side jump. It has been claimed that the side
jump not only contributes to the VHE but fully offsets the anomalous terms
regardless of the drag force for fundamental reasons and, thus, the side-jump
together with skew scattering become the dominant mechanisms. However, this
claim is based on equilibrium theories without any external valley-selective
optical pumping, which makes the results fundamentally interesting but
incomplete and impracticable. We develop in this paper a microscopic theory of
the photoinduced VHE using the Keldysh nonequilibrium diagrammatic technique
and find that the asymmetric skew scattering mechanism is dominant in the
vicinity of the interband absorption edge. This allows us to explain the
operation of optical transistors based on the VHE.

Performance predictors are a type of regression models which can assist to
accomplish the search, while without exerting much computational resource.
Despite various performance predictors have been designed, they employ the same
training protocol to build the regression models: 1) sampling a set of DNNs
with performance as the training dataset, 2) training the model with the mean
square error criterion, and 3) predicting the performance of DNNs newly

constituting the training protocol are not well though-out through intuitive
and illustrative examples. Furthermore, we propose a new training protocol to
address these issues, consisting of designing a pairwise ranking indicator to
construct the training target, proposing to use the logistic regression to fit
the training samples, and developing a differential method to building the
training instances. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed training
protocol, four widely used regression models in the field of machine learning
have been chosen to perform the comparisons on two benchmark datasets. The
experimental results of all the comparisons demonstrate that the proposed

considers multiple ENs that cache sensing data under the coordination of the

coverage, which can be uploaded to the cloud via fronthaul and then be
delivered to other ENs beyond the communication range. However, sensing data
are usually transient with time whereas frequent cache updates could lead to
considerable energy consumption at sensors and fronthaul traffic loads.
Therefore, we adopt age of information to evaluate data freshness and
investigate intelligent caching policies to preserve data freshness while
reducing cache update costs. Specifically, we model the cache update problem as
a cooperative multi-agent Markov decision process with the goal of minimizing
the long-term average weighted cost. To efficiently handle the exponentially
large number of actions, we devise a novel reinforcement learning approach,
which is a discrete multi-agent variant of soft actor-critic (SAC).
Furthermore, we generalize the proposed approach into a decentralized control,
where each EN can make decisions based on local observations only. Simulation

the galaxy distribution from the same density fields in a manner consistent
with ray-tracing, the galaxy-convergence cross-power spectrum measured from the

simulation to forecast the quality of galaxy-shear cross-correlation

attention among researchers. Existing dominant methods solve this problem by
relying on short-term information and dense serial-wise detection on each
individual frames or clips. Despite their effectiveness, these methods showed
inadequate use of long-term information and are prone to inefficiency. In this
paper, we propose for the first time, an efficient framework that generates
action tube proposals from video streams with a single forward pass in a
sparse-to-dense manner. There are two key characteristics in this framework:
(1) Both long-term and short-term sampled information are explicitly utilized
in our spatiotemporal network, (2) A new dynamic feature sampling module (DTS)
is designed to effectively approximate the tube output while keeping the system
tractable. We evaluate the efficacy of our model on the UCF101-24, JHMDB-21 and
UCFSports benchmark datasets, achieving promising results that are competitive
to state-of-the-art methods. The proposed sparse-to-dense strategy rendered our
framework about 7.6 times more efficient than the nearest competitor.

cosmology in F(R) gravity, where the starting point is a suitable ansatz of
observable quantity (like spectral index or tensor to scalar ratio) rather than
a priori form of Hubble parameter. In inflationary scenario, the slow roll
conditions are assumed to hold true, and thus the observational indices have
general expressions in terms of the slow-roll parameters, as for example the
tensor to scalar ratio in F(R) inflation can be expressed as $r =
48\epsilon_F^2$ with $\epsilon_F = -\frac{1}{H_F^2}\frac{dH_F}{dt_F}$ and
$H_F$, $t_F$ are the Hubble parameter, cosmic time respectively. However, in
the bouncing cosmology (say in F(R) gravity theory), the slow-roll conditions
are not satisfied, in general, and thus the observable quantities do not have
any general expressions that will hold true irrespective of the form of F(R).
Thus, in order to apply the bottom-up reconstruction procedure in F(R) bouncing
model, we use the conformal correspondence between F(R) and scalar-tensor model
where the conformal factor in the present context is chosen in a way such that
it leads to an inflationary scenario in the scalar-tensor frame. Due to the
reason that the scalar and tensor perturbations remain invariant under
conformal transformation, the observable viability of the scalar-tensor
inflationary model confirms the viability of the conformally connected F(R)
bouncing model. Motivated by these arguments, here we construct a viable
non-singular bounce in F(R) gravity directly from the observable indices of the
corresponding scalar-tensor inflationary model.

extract dimensional and roughness parameters with accuracy and repeatability.
In a first step, multiple measures of the trench including the average depth,
the volume of recast material, the average longitudinal profile roughness, the
inner trench width and the volume removal rate are studied. This allows for
delineation of ablation regimes and associated characteristics allowing to
determine the impact of fluence and repetition rate on laser milling. In a
second step, additional factors of debris formation and material redeposition
that come into play during laser milling are further elucidated. These results
are utilized for processing large-area (up to few mm2) with milling depths up
to 200 {\mu}m to enable the fabrication of cavities with low surface roughness
at high removal rates of up to 6.9 {\mu}m3 {\mu}s-1. Finally, laser processing

problem of space and astrophysical plasmas, e.g., solar wind and Earth's

turbulent-cascade of macroscopic energy to kinetic-scales where
collisionless-plasma-processes dissipate the energy. Space observations and
numerical simulations show the formation of kinetic scale current sheets in
turbulent plasmas. Instabilities in these CS can provide collisionless
dissipation and influence the turbulence. Spatial gradients of physical
quantities and non-Maxwellian velocity distribution functions provide the
free-energy-sources for CS plasma instabilities. To determine the
free-energy-sources provided by the spatial gradients of plasma density and
electron/ion bulk velocities in CS formed in collisionless turbulent plasmas
with an external magnetic field $\mathbf{B}_0$, we carried out two-dimensional
PIC-hybrid simulations and interpret the results within the limitations of the
simulation model.
  We found that ion-scale CS in a collisionless turbulent plasma are formed
primarily by electron shear flows, i.e., electron bulk velocity inside CS is
much larger than ion bulk velocity while the density variations through the CS
are relatively small ($<$ 10\%). The electron-bulk-velocity and, thus, the
current density inside the sheets are directed mainly parallel to
$\mathbf{B}_0$. The shear in the perpendicular electron- and
ion-bulk-velocities generates parallel electron- and ion-flow-vorticities.
Inside CS, parallel electron-flow-vorticity exceeds the parallel
ion-flow-vorticity, changes sign around the CS centers and peaks near the CS
edges. An ion temperature anisotropy develops near CS during the CS formation.
It has positive correlation with the parallel ion- and
electron-flow-vorticities. Theoretical estimates support the simulation
results.

before the rise of DL, traditional machine learning requires relatively few

success is due to the publicity of the large number of existing annotation

An efficient DR technique is to devise different pricing schemes that encourage
customers to reduce or shift the electric load. In this paper, we consider a
market model for DR using Block Rate Pricing (BRP) of two blocks. We use a
utility maximization approach in a competitive market. We show that when
customers are price taking and the utility cost function is quadratic the
resulting system achieves an equilibrium. Moreover, the equilibrium is unique

effort. A central requirement appearing in relativistic quantum mechanics,
namely local commutativity, is analyzed in detail and possible justifications
are given and discussed. The complexity of the implications of wave function
reduction in connection with Minkowski space-time are illustrated by a quantum
mechanical measurement procedure which was proposed by Aharonov and Albert.
This procedure and its relativistic implications are explicitly analyzed and
discussed in terms of state evolution. This analysis shows that the usual
notion of state evolution fails in relativistic quantum theory. Two possible
solutions of this problem are given. In particular, it is shown that also a
theory with a distinguished foliation of space-time into space-like leafs -
accounting for nonlocality - makes the right predictions for the
Aharonov-Albert experiment. We will repeatedly encounter that an analysis of
the wave-function alone does not suffice to answer the question of relativistic
compatibility of the theory, but that the actual events in space time, which

compared the calculated centroid energies of the giant resonances with

obtain good agreement between the calculated ECEN of isovector giant dipole

find the expression for the transverse momentum distribution of the gluon
radiation of the heavy quark propagating in the quark gluon plasma in the
framework of the Moliere theory, taking into account the BDMPSZ radiation in
the harmonic oscillator (HO) approximation, and the Coulomb logarithms
described by the additional logarithmic terms in the effective potential. We
show that these Coulomb logarithms significantly influence the HO distribution,
derived in the BDMPSZ works, especially for the small transverse momenta,
filling the dead cone, and reducing the dead cone suppression of the heavy
quark radiation (dead cone effect). In addition we study the effect of the
phase space constraints on the heavy quark energy loss, and argue that taking
into account of both the phase space constraints and of the Coulomb gluons
reduces the dependence of the heavy quark energy loss on its mas in the HO
approximation.

activities and in the animal world. Here we incorporate this factor into the
evolutionary game to see what impact it could have on the cooperation outcome.
The probabilistic strategy adoption between two players is then not only
determined by their payoffs, but also by their hierarchy difference -- players
in the high rank are more likely to reproduce their strategies than the peers
in the low rank. Through simulating the evolution of Prisoners' dilemma game
with three hierarchical distributions, we find that the levels of cooperation
are enhanced in all cases, and the enhancement is optimal in the uniform case.
The enhancement is due to the fact that the presence of hierarchy facilitates
the formation of cooperation clusters with high-rank players acting as the
nucleation cores. This mechanism remains valid on Barab\'asi-Albert scale-free
networks, in particular the cooperation enhancement is maximal when the hubs
are of higher social ranks. We also study a two-hierarchy model, where similar
cooperation promotion is revealed and some theoretical analyses are provided.
Our finding may partially explain why the social hierarchy is so ubiquitous on
this planet.

Ising model of ferromagnetism to Kitaev's one-dimensional p-wave
superconductor, which has its application in fault-tolerant topological quantum
computing. Mapping Pauli's spin operators of transverse Ising chain to spinless
fermionic creation and annihilation operators by Inverse Jordan-Wigner
transformation leads to a Hamiltonian form closely related to Kitaev Chain,
which exhibits topological phase transition where phases are characterized by
different topological invariant that changes discontinuously at the transition
point. Kitaev Chain supports two Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in the non-trivial
topological phase, while none is in the trivial phase. The doubly degenerate
ground state of the transverse Ising in ferromagnetic phase corresponds to
non-local free fermion degree made from MZMs. The quasi-particle excitations of
Ising chain, viz., domain wall formation in the ferromagnetic phase and
spin-flip in paramagnetic phase maps to Bogoliubon excitations. The mapping
suggests that a non-local order parameter can be defined for Kitaev Chain to
work with the usual paradigm of Landau's theory.

barriers and enhancers to stochastic transport. This topological segmentation
is closely related to the theory of Lagrangian coherent structures and is based
on a recently introduced quantity, the diffusion barrier strength (DBS). The
DBS is defined similar to the finite-time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE), but
incorporates diffusion during flow integration. Height ridges of the DBS
indicate stochastic transport barriers and enhancers, i.e. material surfaces
that are minimally or maximally diffusive. To apply these concepts to
real-world data, we represent uncertainty in a flow by a stochastic
differential equation that consists of a deterministic and a stochastic
component modeled by a Gaussian. With this formulation we identify barriers and
enhancers to stochastic transport, without performing expensive Monte Carlo
simulation and with a computational complexity comparable to FTLE. In addition,
we propose a complementary visualization to convey the absolute scale of
uncertainties in the Lagrangian frame of reference. This enables us to study
uncertainty in real-world datasets, for example due to small deviations, data
reduction, or estimated from multiple ensemble runs.

specific reactions to the virus, even if they are invisible without specialized
equipment. Our experience shows that the EMEE signal is very sensitive to weak
