various quantitative MRI applications, such as MR Fingerprinting and MR-STAT.
This work uses a new EPG-Bloch model for accurate simulation of transient-state
gradient-spoiled MR sequences, and proposes a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) as
a fast surrogate of the EPG-Bloch model for computing large-scale MR signals
and derivatives. The computational efficiency of the RNN model is demonstrated
by comparing with other existing models, showing one to three orders of
acceleration comparing to the latest GPU-accelerated open-source EPG package.
By using numerical and in-vivo brain data, two use cases, namely MRF dictionary
generation and optimal experimental design, are also provided. Results show
that the RNN surrogate model can be efficiently used for computing large-scale
dictionaries of transient-states signals and derivatives within tens of
seconds, resulting in several orders of magnitude acceleration with respect to
state-of-the-art implementations. The practical application of transient-states
quantitative techniques can therefore be substantially facilitated.

Analysis of the literature has elucidated the costs and benefits of, as well as

  to the final published version except for minor formatting improvements and
  corrected typos",,,,"gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main goal of this thesis is to quantize the Einstein-Hilbert action
extended by the quadratic curvature terms within the canonical quantization
approach, thus formulating quantum geometrodynamics of the higher derivative
theories. The motivation is to provide an alternative to the standard canonical
quantization based on the Einstein-Hilbert action alone, because the latter
does not generate the quadratic curvature terms in the semiclassical limit. A
particular formulation of a semiclassical approximation scheme is employed
which ensures that the effects of the quadratic curvature terms become
perturbative in the semiclassical limit. This leaves the classical General
Relativity intact, while naturally giving rise to its first semiclassical
corrections. Another topic of interest is a classical theory where the
quadratic Ricci scalar and the Einstein-Hilbert term are absent from the
action, which then enjoys the symmetry with respect to the conformal
transformation of fields (local Weyl rescaling). We pay a special attention to
this case, since it provides a natural setting for the absence of the notion of
a physical length scale. Certain useful model-independent tools are also
constructed in this thesis. Firstly, dimensionless coordinates and the
unimodular decomposition of the metric are used to expose the only conformally
variant degree of freedom, making the geometrical origin of the physical length
scale apparent. With such an approach several earlier results become much more
transparent. Secondly, using unimodular-conformal variables a model-independent
generator of conformal field transformations is constructed in terms of which a
reformulation of the definition of conformal invariance is given. Thirdly, it
is argued that a canonical quantization scheme makes more sense to be based on
the quantization of generators of relevant transformations, than on first class
constraints.

appears in various applications ranging from spintronics to neuroscience. When
the network is forced by an external signal common to all its elements, there
are shown to be two potential (gradient) functions: One for amplitudes and one
for phases. But the phase potential disappears when the forcing is removed. The
phase potential describes the distribution of in-phase/anti-phase oscillations
in the network, as well as resonances in the form of phase locking. A valley in
a potential surface corresponds to memory that may be accessed by associative
recall. The two potentials derived here exhibit two different forms of memory:
structural memory (time domain memory) that is sustained in the free problem,
and evoked memory (frequency domain memory) that is sustained by the phase
potential, only appearing when the system is illuminated by common external
forcing. The common forcing organizes the network into those elements that are
locked to forcing frequencies and other elements that may form secluded
sub-networks. The secluded networks may perform independent operations such as
pattern recognition and logic computations. Various control methods for shaping
the network's outputs are demonstrated.

the efficacy of our approach with simulated examples including navigation in

pomeron-pomeron-$f_{1}$ tensorial couplings labeled by $(l,S) = (2,2)$ and
$(4,4)$ are derived. We adjust the model parameters (coupling constants, cutoff
constant) to the WA102 experimental data taking into account absorption
effects. Both the $(l,S) = (2,2)$ and $(4,4)$ couplings separately allow one to
describe the WA102 differential distributions. We compare these predictions
with those of the Sakai-Sugimoto model, where the pomeron-pomeron-$f_{1}$
couplings are determined by the mixed axial-gravitational anomaly of QCD. We
derive an approximate relation between the pomeron-pomeron-$f_{1}$ coupling
constants of this approach and the $(l,S) = (2,2)$ and $(4,4)$ couplings. Then
we present our predictions for the energies available at the RHIC and LHC. The
total cross sections and several differential distributions are presented.
Analysis of the distributions in the azimuthal angle $\phi_{pp}$ between the
transverse momenta of the outgoing protons may be used to disentangle $f_{1}$-
and $\eta$-type resonances contributing to the same final channel. We find for
the $f_{1}(1285)$ a total cross section $\sim 38$ $\mu$b for $\sqrt{s} = 13$
TeV and a rapidity cut on the $f_{1}$ of $|{\rm y_{M}}| < 2.5$. We predict a
much larger cross section for production of $f_{1}(1285)$ than for production
of $f_{2}(1270)$ in the $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ decay channel for the

targeted. One is the mapping of the distribution of neutral atomic carbon, and
the carbon monoxide (CO) molecule in higher energy states, in large parts of
the Milky Way, and in selected external galaxies. Such studies would advance
our understanding of molecular hydrogen present in the interstellar medium, but
partly missed by existing observations; and characterize Galaxy-wide molecular
cloud excitation conditions, through multi-level CO observations. Stars form in
interstellar clouds of molecular gas and dust, and these observations would
allow research into the formation and destruction processes of such molecular
clouds and the life cycle of galaxies. As the second goal, the observatory
would add a new location to the global Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) network,
which lacks a station in the Himalayan longitudes. This addition would enhance
the quality of the images synthesized by the EHT, support observations in
higher sub-millimeter wave bands, sharpening its resolving ability, improve its

ranging from data science to chemistry to materials science. However, a
possible obstacle to realizing that speedup is the Barren Plateau (BP)
phenomenon, whereby the gradient vanishes exponentially in the system size $n$
for certain QNN architectures. The question of whether high-order derivative
information such as the Hessian could help escape a BP was recently posed in
the literature. Here we show that the elements of the Hessian are exponentially
suppressed in a BP, so estimating the Hessian in this situation would require a
precision that scales exponentially with $n$. Hence, Hessian-based approaches
do not circumvent the exponential scaling associated with BPs. We also show the
exponential suppression of higher order derivatives. Hence, BPs will impact
optimization strategies that go beyond (first-order) gradient descent. In
deriving our results, we prove novel, general formulas that can be used to
analytically evaluate any high-order partial derivative on quantum hardware.
These formulas will likely have independent interest and use for training
quantum neural networks (outside of the context of BPs).

brightest (V~ 10) nova-like cataclysmic variables. This unique system is
surrounded by a bright emission nebula, likely to be the remnant of a recent
nova eruption. Embedded within this nebula is a prominent bow-shock, where the
system's accretion disc wind runs into its own nova shell. In order to
establish its fundamental properties, we present the first comprehensive
multi-wavelength study of the system. Long-term photometry reveals
quasi-periodic, super-orbital variations with a characteristic time-scale of
10-16 days and typical amplitude of ~1 mag. High-cadence photometry from TESS
reveals for the first time both the orbital period and a ""negative superhump""
period. The latter is usually interpreted as the signature of a tilted
accretion disc. We propose a recently developed disc instability model as a
plausible explanation for the photometric behaviour. In our spectroscopic data,
we clearly detect anti-phased absorption and emission line components. Their
radial velocities suggest a high mass ratio, which in turn implies an unusually
low white dwarf mass. We also constrain the wind mass-loss rate of the system
from the spatially resolved [O iii] emission produced in the bow-shock; this
can be used to test and calibrate accretion disc wind models. We suggest a
possible association between V341 Ara and a ""guest star"" mentioned in Chinese
historical records in AD1240. If this marks the date of the system's nova
eruption, V341 Ara would be the oldest recovered nova of its class and an
excellent laboratory for testing nova theory.

Due to the manual nature of this process, it is time-consuming to learn,

run A/B tests for multiple advertisers in parallel, we explore the possibility
of collaboratively learning ad creative refinement via A/B tests of multiple

phenomenon known as spectral evolution. In particular, some stars enter the
cooling sequence with helium atmospheres (type DO) but eventually develop
hydrogen atmospheres (type DA), most likely through the upward diffusion of
residual hydrogen. Our empirical knowledge of this process remains scarce: the
fractions of white dwarfs that are born helium-rich and that experience the
DO-to-DA transformation are poorly constrained. We tackle this issue by
performing a detailed model-atmosphere investigation of 1806 hot ($T_{\rm eff}
\ge 30,000$ K) white dwarfs observed spectroscopically by the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey. We first introduce our new generations of model atmospheres and
theoretical cooling tracks, both appropriate for hot white dwarfs. We then
present our spectroscopic analysis, from which we determine the atmospheric and
stellar parameters of our sample objects. We find that $\sim$24% of white
dwarfs begin their degenerate life as DO stars, among which $\sim$2/3 later
become DA stars. We also infer that the DO-to-DA transition occurs at
substantially different temperatures ($75,000 \ {\rm K} > T_{\rm eff} > 30,000$
K) for different objects, implying a broad range of hydrogen content within the
DO population. Furthermore, we identify 127 hybrid white dwarfs, including 31
showing evidence of chemical stratification, and we discuss how these stars fit
in our understanding of the spectral evolution. Finally, we uncover significant
problems in the spectroscopic mass scale of very hot ($T_{\rm eff} > 60,000$ K)

approximates the $n$-qubit parity function to within error $\varepsilon$ on

sublogarithmic depth could approximate parity regardless of size.
  $\bullet$ We introduce a class of ""mostly classical"" QAC circuits, including
a major component of our circuit from the above upper bound, and prove a tight
lower bound on the size of low-depth, mostly classical QAC circuits that

correspondence between variational symmetries and conservation laws arising
from Noether's theorem, which has a well-known generalization to
non-variational PDEs, where infinitesimal symmetries are replaced by
adjoint-symmetries, and variational symmetries are replaced by multipliers
(adjoint-symmetries satisfying a certain Euler-Lagrange condition). Several
main results are obtained. Symmetries are shown to have three different linear
actions on the linear space of adjoint-symmetries. These linear actions are
used to construct bilinear adjoint-symmetry brackets, one of which is a
pull-back of the symmetry commutator bracket and has the properties of a Lie
bracket. The brackets do not use or require the existence of any local
variational structure (Hamiltonian or Lagrangian) and thus apply to general PDE
systems. One of the symmetry actions is shown to encode a pre-sympletic

symplectic 2-form and Poisson bracket for evolution systems. The generalized
KdV equation in potential form is used to illustrate all of the results.

proposed approach to a previous social scientific study, showing it enables
richer inference than the significance-vs.-insignificance approach taken by the
original study. The accompanying R package makes my approach easy to implement.

different infall episodes, and we explore several physical parameters, such as
radial gas flows, variable efficiency of star formation, different times for
the maximum infall onto the disc, different distributions of the total surface
mass density of the thick disc and enriched gas infall. Our best model suggests
that radial gas flows and variable efficiency of star formation should be
acting together with the inside-out mechanism for the thin disc formation. The
timescale for maximum infall onto the thin disc, which determines the gap
between the formation of the two discs, should be $t_{max}\simeq 3.25$ Gyr. The
thick disc should have an exponential, small scale length density profile and
gas infall on the inner thin disc should be enriched. We compute also the

integrated ordering strategy to the blood inventory management system in

ordering strategy reduces the inventory level by 40% and decreases the ordering
frequency by 60%, with low incidence of shortages and wastage due to

radial basis function (RBF) is utilized to interpolate the implicit design
field. The triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) lattice is employed to
demonstrate the proposed method. Compared with conventional
homogenization-based topology optimization, the proposed method can effectively
resolve the stress-constrained lattice design; for example, sharp corners are
removed from the initial design after optimization. Several two- and
three-dimensional lattice design examples are presented to solve the compliance
and stress-constrained problems, for which GPU-based computing is adopted to
accelerate the finite element analysis. The proposed PIMM method is flexible

and drugs. However, little is known about SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary

immune response via APOBEC and ADAR gene editing gives rise to near 65\% of

elderly may be at high risk from COVID-19 because of their overreacting to the
viral infection. Moreover, we uncover that populations of Oceania and Africa
react significantly more intensively to SARS-CoV-2 infection than those of

However, it is unclear whether the two-level systems that dominate mechanical
and dielectric losses are the same; the former relies on phonon-TLS coupling,
with an elastic field coupling constant, $\gamma$, while the latter depends on
a TLS dipole moment, $p_0$, which couples to the electromagnetic field.
Mechanical and dielectric loss measurements as well as structural
characterization were performed on amorphous silicon thin films grown by
electron beam deposition with a range of growth parameters. Samples grown at
425 $^{\circ}$C show a large reduction of mechanical loss (34 times) and a far
smaller reduction of dielectric loss (2.3 times) compared to those grown at
room temperature. Additionally, mechanical loss shows lower loss per unit
volume for thicker films, while dielectric loss shows lower loss per unit
volume for thinner films. Analysis of these results indicate that mechanical
loss correlates with atomic density, while dielectric loss correlates with
dangling bond density, suggesting a different origin for these two energy
dissipation processes in amorphous silicon.

networks, where the external control inputs are injected to only some nodes,
namely the leaders. For such systems, one measure of controllability is the
dimension of strong structurally controllable subspace, which is equal to the
smallest possible rank of controllability matrix under admissible (positive)
coupling weights. In this paper, we compare two tight lower bounds on the
dimension of strong structurally controllable subspace: one based on the
distances of followers to leaders, and the other based on the graph coloring
process known as zero forcing. We show that the distance-based lower bound is
usually better than the zero-forcing-based bound when the leaders do not
constitute a zero-forcing set. On the other hand, we also show that any set of
leaders that can be shown to achieve complete SSC via the distance-based bound
is necessarily a zero-forcing set. These results indicate that while the
zero-forcing based approach may be preferable when the focus is only on
verifying complete SSC, the distance-based approach is usually more informative
when partial SSC is also of interest. Furthermore, we also present a novel
bound based on the combination of these two approaches, which is always at
least as good as, and in some cases strictly greater than, the maximum of the
two bounds. We support our analysis with numerical results for various graphs

with the ambiguity of discretisation schemes defining stochastic differential
equations. In this paper, we solve the issue of these ""inflationary stochastic
anomalies"" by using the Stratonovich discretisation satisfying general
covariance, and identifying that the quantum nature of the fluctuating fields
entails the existence of a preferred frame defining independent stochastic
noises. Moreover, we derive physically equivalent It\^o-Langevin equations that
are manifestly covariant and well suited for numerical computations. These
equations are formulated in the general context of multifield inflation with
curved field space, taking into account the coupling to gravity as well as the
full phase space in the Hamiltonian language, but this resolution is also
relevant in simpler single-field setups. We also develop a path-integral
derivation of these equations, which solves conceptual issues of the heuristic
approach made at the level of the classical equations of motion, and allows in
principle to compute corrections to the stochastic formalism. Using the
Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we integrate out small-scale fluctuations, derive

intersection of the data sets $\cap_{i=1}^M \mathcal{p}_i$ without leaking any

specific communication protocol where one of the parties, called the leader
party, initiates the MP-PSI protocol by sending queries to the remaining
parties which are called client parties. The client parties are not allowed to
communicate with each other. We propose an information-theoretic scheme that
privately calculates the intersection $\cap_{i=1}^M \mathcal{p}_i$ with a

Surveys
now detect this phenomenon for one fifth of main-sequence stars, across various
spectral types and ages. The excesses are interpreted as populations of small,
hot dust grains very close to their stars, which must originate from comets or
asteroids. However, the presence of such grains in copious amounts is
mysterious, since they should rapidly sublimate or be blown out of the system.
Here we investigate a potential mechanism to generate excesses: dust migrating
inwards under radiation forces sublimates near the star, releasing modest
quantities of gas which then traps subsequent grains. This mechanism requires
neither specialised system architectures nor high dust supply rates, and could
operate across diverse stellar types and ages. The model naturally reproduces
many features of inferred dust populations, in particular their location,
preference for small grains, steep size distribution, and dust location scaling
with stellar luminosity. For Sun-like stars the mechanism can produce 2.2
micron excesses that are an order of magnitude larger than those at 8.5 micron,
as required by observations. However, for A-type stars the simulated
near-infrared excesses were only twice those in the mid infrared; grains would
have to be 5-10 times smaller than those trapped in our model to be able to
explain observed near-infrared excesses around A stars. Further progress with
any hot dust explanation for A stars requires a means for grains to become very
hot without either rapidly sublimating or being blown out of the system.

Such a measure is justified whenever we aim to quantify the similarity of the

similarity of handwritten characters. Perhaps the most natural such notion is
the (discrete) Fr\'echet distance under translation. Unfortunately, the
algorithmic literature on this problem yields a very pessimistic view: On
polygonal curves with $n$ vertices, the fastest algorithm runs in time
$O(n^{4.667})$ and cannot be improved below $n^{4-o(1)}$ unless the Strong
Exponential Time Hypothesis fails. Can we still obtain an implementation that
is efficient on realistic datasets?
  Spurred by the surprising performance of recent implementations for the
Fr\'echet distance, we perform algorithm engineering for the Fr\'echet distance
under translation. Our solution combines fast, but inexact tools from
continuous optimization (specifically, branch-and-bound algorithms for global
Lipschitz optimization) with exact, but expensive algorithms from computational
geometry (specifically, problem-specific algorithms based on an arrangement
construction). We combine these two ingredients to obtain an exact decision
algorithm for the Fr\'echet distance under translation. For the related task of
computing the distance value up to a desired precision, we engineer and compare
different methods. On a benchmark set involving handwritten characters and
route trajectories, our implementation answers a typical query for either task

Capturing how the turbulent flow meanders amongst unstable states (simple

efficient representation offers the best hope of doing this, despite the
inherent difficulty in identifying these states. Here, we make a significant
step towards this goal by demonstrating that deep convolutional autoencoders
can identify low-dimensional representations of two-dimensional turbulence
which are closely associated with the simple invariant solutions characterizing
the turbulent attractor. To establish this, we develop latent Fourier analysis
that decomposes the flow embedding into a set of orthogonal latent Fourier
modes which decode into physically meaningful patterns resembling simple
invariant solutions. The utility of this approach is highlighted by analysing
turbulent Kolmogorov flow (flow on a 2D torus forced at large scale) at $Re=40$
where, in between intermittent bursts, the flow resides in the neighbourhood of
an unstable state and is very low dimensional. Projections onto individual
latent Fourier wavenumbers reveal the simple invariant solutions organising
both the quiescent and bursting dynamics in a systematic way inaccessible to
previous approaches.

temperatures than canonical horizontal branch stars. They are believed to be
formed when a red giant suffers an extreme mass-loss episode. Binary
interaction is suggested to be the main formation channel, but the high
fraction of apparently single hot subdwarfs (up to 30%) has prompted single
star formation scenarios to be proposed. If such formation scenarios without
interaction were possible, that would also imply the existence of hot subdwarfs
in wide binaries that have undergone no interaction. We probe the existence of
these systems by analysing light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS) for all known hot subdwarfs with a main sequence wide binary
companion, and by searching for common proper motion pairs to spectroscopically
confirmed hot subdwarfs. We find that (i) the companions in composite hot
subdwarfs show short rotation periods when compared to field main sequence
stars. They display a triangular-shaped distribution with a peak around 2.5
days, similar to what is observed for young open clusters. This observed
distribution of rotation rates for the companions in known wide hot subdwarf
binaries provides evidence of previous interaction causing spin-up. We also
report (ii) a shortage of hot subdwarfs with candidate common proper motion
companions, considering the frequency of such systems among progenitors. We
identify only 16 candidates after probing 2938 hot subdwarfs with good
astrometry. Out of those, at least six seem to be hierarchical triple systems,
in which the hot subdwarf is part of an inner binary. These results suggest
that binary interaction is always required for the formation of hot subdwarfs.

(measured from the UV continuum excess) of protoplanetary discs and their
masses inferred from observations of the sub-mm continuum. While viscous
evolution models predict such a correlation, the predicted values are in
tension with data obtained from the Lupus and Upper Scorpius star forming
regions; for example, they underpredict the scatter in accretion rates,
particularly in older regions. Here we argue that since the sub-mm observations
trace the discs' dust, by explicitly modelling the dust grain growth,
evolution, and emission, we can better understand the correlation. We show that
for turbulent viscosities with $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-3}$, the depletion of dust
from the disc due to radial drift means we can reproduce the range of masses
and accretion rates seen in the Lupus and Upper Sco datasets. One consequence
of this model is that the upper locus of accretion rates at a given dust mass
does not evolve with the age of the region. Moreover, we find that internal
photoevaporation is necessary to produce the lowest accretion rates observed.
In order to replicate the correct dust masses at the time of disc dispersal, we
favour relatively low photoevaporation rates $\lesssim
10^{-9}~M_{\odot}~\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ for most sources but cannot discriminate
between EUV or X-ray driven winds. A limited number of sources, particularly in
Lupus, are shown to have higher masses than predicted by our models which may
be evidence for variations in the properties of the dust or dust trapping
induced in substructures.

theory is conjectured to describe the symmetric product orbifold CFT. We
consider the string on different Euclidean backgrounds such as thermal
$\text{AdS}_3$, the BTZ black hole, conical defects and wormhole geometries. In
simple examples we compute the full string partition function. We find it to be
independent of the precise bulk geometry, but only dependent on the geometry of
the conformal boundary. For example, the string partition function on thermal
$\text{AdS}_3$ and the conical defect with a torus boundary is shown to agree,
thus giving evidence for the equivalence of the tensionless string on these
different background geometries. We also find that thermal $\text{AdS}_3$ and
the BTZ black hole are dual descriptions and the vacuum of the BTZ black hole
is mapped to a single long string winding many times asymptotically around
thermal $\text{AdS}_3$. Thus the system yields a concrete example of the
string-black hole transition. Consequently, reproducing the boundary partition
function does not require a sum over bulk geometries, but rather agrees with
the string partition function on any bulk geometry with the appropriate
boundary. We argue that the same mechanism can lead to a resolution of the

different galaxy formation models, each with and without magnetic fields, and
include additional spatial refinement in the CGM to improve its resolution. The
central galaxy's star formation rate and stellar mass are not strongly affected
by the presence of magnetic fields, but the galaxy is more disc-dominated and
its central black hole is more massive when $B>0$. The physical properties of
the CGM change significantly. With magnetic fields, the circumgalactic gas
flows are slower, the atomic hydrogen-dominated extended discs around the
galaxy are more massive and the densities in the inner CGM are therefore
higher, the temperatures in the outer CGM are higher, and the pressure in the
halo is higher and smoother. The total gas fraction and metal mass fraction in
the halo are also higher when magnetic fields are included, because less gas
escapes the halo. Additionally, we find that the CGM properties depend on
azimuthal angle and that magnetic fields reduce the scatter in radial velocity,
whilst enhancing the scatter in metallicity at fixed azimuthal angle. The
metals are thus less well-mixed throughout the halo, resulting in more
metal-poor halo gas. These results together show that magnetic fields in the
CGM change the flow of gas in galaxy haloes, making it more difficult for
metal-rich outflows to mix with the metal-poor CGM and to escape the halo, and
therefore should be included in simulations of galaxy formation.

jet opening angle corrected energetics of the prompt emission episode are

in sub-GeV energy range. The X-ray afterglow light curves of these bursts do
not show any shallow decay behaviour such as a plateau, however, a few cases
exhibit flares and multiple breaks instead of a single power-law decay. For a

requiring high efficiencies implies that either the mass of these black holes

reduced or nonexistent generalization ability. We experimentally verify these

follows a Gaussian distribution centered around -1.9 with a standard deviation
of 0.6 and is on average flatter than the integrated emission, which has a
spectral index of -2.81 $\pm$ 0.02. The waiting times between the GPs are
accurately described by a Poissonian distribution, suggesting that the time of
occurrence of a GP is independent from the times of occurrence of other GPs. 76

where inflaton is identified as a non-compact axion-like field, sub-leading
non-perturbative effects can superimpose steep cliffs connected by smooth
plateaus onto the underlying axion potential. In the presence of coupling to
Abelian gauge fields, the motion of axion on the cliff-like region(s) of its
potential triggers a localized production of one helicity state of gauge fields
due to the temporary fast-roll of axion around such a feature. In this setup,
primordial fluctuations sourced by vector fields exhibit a localized peak in
momentum space corresponding to modes that exit the horizon when the axion
velocity is maximal. As an application of this general mechanism, we present an
example of axion inflation which both matches Planck observations at CMB scales
and generates a population of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH} \simeq 10^{-13}
M_{\odot}$) that can account for all dark matter. In this scenario, the
enhanced scalar fluctuations that leads to PBHs also generate an observable
SGWB of induced origin at LISA scales. The amplitude and shape of the resulting
GW signal inherits specific properties (such as non-Gaussianity and its shape)
of its scalar sources that may allow us to distinguish this mechanism from
other inflationary scenarios and astrophysical backgrounds. This GW signal
together with an observation of PBH distribution at the corresponding scales
can thus provide a window to the inflationary dynamics on scales much smaller
than those probed by Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Large Scale

transmission. The message passing algorithm (MPA) is employed to detect the
transmitted signals, which suffers from high complexity. This paper proposes
three low-complexity algorithms for the first time to the SM-SCMA. The first
algorithm is referred to as successive user detection (SUD), while the second
algorithm is the modified version of SUD, namely modified SUD (MSUD). Then, for
the first time, the tree-search of the SM-SCMA is constructed. Based on that
tree-search, another variant of the sphere decoder (SD) is proposed for the
SM-SCMA, referred to as fixed-complexity SD (FCSD). SUD provides a benchmark
for decoding complexity at the expense of bit-error-rate (BER) performance.
Further, MSUD slightly increases the complexity of SUD with a significant
improvement in BER performance. Finally, FCSD provides a near-optimum BER with
a considerable reduction of the complexity compared to the MPA decoder and also
supports parallel hardware implementation. The proposed algorithms provide
flexible design choices for practical implementation based on system design
demands. The complexity analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations of the BER are
provided for the proposed algorithms.

recent years. These events have severely impacted power systems ranging from
long outage times to major equipment (e.g., substations, transmission lines,
power plants, and distribution system) destruction. Distribution system
failures and outages are major contributors to power supply interruptions.
Network reconfiguration and movable energy resources (MERs) can play a vital
role in supplying loads during and after contingencies. This paper proposes a
two-stage strategy to determine the minimum sizes of MERs with network
reconfiguration for distribution service restoration and supplying local and
isolated loads. Sequential Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the
outages of distribution system components. After a contingency, the first stage
determines the network reconfiguration based on the spanning tree search
algorithm. In the second stage, if some system loads cannot be fed by network
reconfiguration, MERs are deployed and the optimal routes to reach isolated
areas are determined based on the DSPA. The traveling time obtained from the
DSPA is incorporated with the proposed sequential Monte Carlo simulation-based
approach to determine the sizes of MERs. The proposed method is applied on
several distribution systems including the IEEE-13 and IEEE-123 node test
feeders. The results show that network reconfiguration can reduce the required
sizes of MERs to supply isolated areas.

Seeking clarification from the user to classify user intents not only helps

called a Poisson receiver, that is characterized by a success probability
function of a tagged packet subject to a Poisson offered load. We show that
various coded slotted ALOHA (CSA) systems are Poisson receivers. Moreover,
Poisson receivers have two elegant closure properties: (i) Poisson receivers
with packet routing are still Poisson receivers, and (ii) Poisson receivers
with packet coding are still Poisson receivers. These two closure properties
enable us to use smaller Poisson receivers as building blocks for analyzing a
larger Poisson receiver. As such, we can analyze complicated systems that are
not possible by the classical tree evaluation method. In particular, for CSA
systems with both spatial diversity and temporal diversity, we can use the
framework of Poisson receivers to compute the exact (asymptotic) throughput. We
demonstrate that our framework can be used to provide differentiated services
between ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) traffic and enhanced
mobile broadband (eMBB) traffic. By conducting extensive simulations, we also
verify that our theoretical results match extremely well with the simulation

presence of stringent task-server compatibility constraints. Consider a system
with $N$ identical single-server queues and $M(N)$ task types, where each
server is able to process only a small subset of possible task types. Each
arriving task selects $d\geq 2$ random servers compatible to its type, and
joins the shortest queue among them. The compatibility constraint is naturally
captured by a fixed bipartite graph $G_N$ between the servers and the task
types. When $G_N$ is complete bipartite, the meanfield approximation is proven
to be accurate. However, such dense compatibility graphs are infeasible due to
their overwhelming implementation cost and prohibitive storage capacity
requirement at the servers. Our goal in this paper is to characterize the class
of sparse compatibility graphs for which the meanfield approximation remains
valid.
  To achieve this, first, we introduce a novel graph expansion-based notion,
called proportional sparsity, and establish that systems with proportionally
sparse compatibility graphs match the performance of a fully flexible system,
asymptotically in the large-system limit. Furthermore, for any $c(N)$
satisfying $$\frac{Nc(N)}{M(N)\ln(N)}\to \infty\quad \text{and}\quad c(N)\to
\infty,$$ as $N\to\infty$, we show that proportionally sparse random
compatibility graphs can be designed, so that the degree of each server is at
most $c(N)$. This reduces the server-degree almost by a factor $N/\ln(N)$,
compared to the complete bipartite compatibility graph, while maintaining the
same asymptotic performance. Extensive simulation experiments are conducted to
corroborate the theoretical results.

which is the ratio of outward viscous flux of angular momentum from the inner

""accretion"" disc, where the central boundary condition is zero-torque, is
represented by $f=0$. A ""decretion"" disc, where the radial velocity at the
inner boundary is zero, is represented by $f\rightarrow\infty$. For $f > 0$ a
torque is applied to the disc at the inner boundary, which feeds both angular
momentum and energy into the disc. This can arise, for example, in the case of
a circumbinary disc where resonances transfer energy and angular momentum from
the binary to the disc orbits, or where the disc is around a rotating magnetic
star which can allow the disc orbits to be accelerated outwards at the
magnetospheric radius. We present steady-state solutions to the disc structure
as a function of $f$, and for arbitrary kinematic viscosity $\nu$. For
time-dependent discs, we solve the equations using a Green's function approach
for the specific case of $\nu \propto R$ and provide an example numerical
solution to the equations for the case of $\nu \propto R^{3/2}$. We find that
for values of $f\lesssim 0.1$ the disc solutions closely resemble ""accretion""
discs. For values of $f \gtrsim 10$ the solutions initially resemble

their full potential due to their exces-sive laser power consumption. Prior
works that attempt to improve laser power efficiency in PNoCs do not consider

symmetries enforce deconfinement of the fundamental quark. When the adjoint
quark has a small mass, $m\ll g_\mathrm{YM}$, the theory confines and the
non-invertible symmetries are softly broken. We use them to compute
analytically the $k$-string tension for $N\leq 5$. Our results suggest that the
$k$-string tension, $T_k$, is $T_k\sim |m| \sin(\pi k /N)$ for all $N$. We also
consider the dynamics of adjoint QCD deformed by symmetric quartic fermion
interactions. These operators are not generated by the RG flow due to the
non-invertible symmetries, thus violating the ordinary notion of naturalness.
We conjecture partial confinement for the deformed theory by these four-fermion

topological phases at zero and large mass, we find that a massless particle

with an emergent supersymmetry at nonzero mass. We also study the possible

we are able to do exhaustively for small values of $N$. The paper contains

La1.6-xNd0.4SrxCuO4 (Nd-LSCO), has been of significant and sustained interest,
in large part because it displays the full complexity of the phase diagram for
canonical hole-doped, high Tc superconductivity, while also displaying
relatively low superconducting critical temperatures. The low superconducting
Tc's imply that experimentally accessible magnetic fields can suppress the
superconductivity to zero temperature. In particular, this has enabled various
transport and thermodynamic studies of the T = 0 ground state in Nd-LSCO, free
of superconductivity, across the critical doping p* = 0.23 where the pseudogap
phase ends. The strong dependence of its superconducting properties on its
crystal symmetry has itself motivated careful studies of the Nd-LSCO structural
phase diagram. This paper provides a systematic study and summary of the
materials preparation and characterization of both single crystal and
polycrystalline samples of Nd-LSCO. Single-phase polycrystalline samples with x
spanning the range from 0.01 to 0.40 have been synthesized, and large single
crystals of Nd-LSCO for select x across the region (0.07, 0.12, 0.17, 0.19,
0.225, 0.24, and 0.26) were grown by the optical floating zone method.
Systematic neutron and X-ray diffraction studies on these samples were
performed at both low and room temperatures, 10 K and 300 K, respectively.
These studies allowed us to follow the various structural phase transitions and
propose an updated structural phase diagram for Nd-LSCO. In particular, we
found that the low-temperature tetragonal (LTT) phase ends at a critical doping
pLTT = 0.255(5), clearly separated from p*.

muscle co-contraction and feedback gains during early adaptation. We previously
proposed that internal model uncertainty drives these changes, whereby the
sensorimotor system reacts to the change in dynamics by up regulating stiffness
and feedback gains to reduce the effect of model errors. However, these
feedback gain increases have also been suggested to represent part of the
adaptation mechanism. Here, we investigate this by examining changes in
visuomotor feedback gains during gradual or abrupt force field adaptation.
Participants grasped a robotic manipulandum and reached while a curl force
field was introduced gradually or abruptly. Abrupt introduction of dynamics
elicited large initial increases in kinematic error, muscle co-contraction and
visuomotor feedback gains, while gradual introduction showed little initial
change in these measures despite evidence of adaptation. After adaptation had
plateaued,there was a change in the co-contraction and visuomotor feedback
gains relative to null field movements, but no differences (apart from the
final muscle activation pattern) between the abrupt and gradual introduction of
dynamics. This suggests that the initial increase in feedback gains is not part
of the adaptation process, but instead an automatic reactive response to
internal model uncertainty. In contrast, the final level of feedback gains is a
predictive tuning of the feedback gains to the external dynamics as part of the
internal model adaptation. Together, the reactive and predictive feedback gains
explain the wide variety of previous experimental results of feedback changes
during adaptation.

Myocardium feature tracking (FT) can directly estimate cardiac motion from cine
MRI, which requires no special scanning procedure. However, current deep
learning-based FT methods may result in unrealistic myocardium shapes since the
learning is solely guided by image intensities without considering anatomy. On
the other hand, motion estimation through learning is challenging because
ground-truth motion fields are almost impossible to obtain. In this study, we
propose a novel Anatomy-Aware Tracker (AATracker) for cardiac motion estimation
that preserves anatomy by weak supervision. A convolutional variational
autoencoder (VAE) is trained to encapsulate realistic myocardium shapes. A
baseline dense motion tracker is trained to approximate the motion fields and
then refined to estimate anatomy-aware motion fields under the weak supervision
from the VAE. We evaluate the proposed method on long-axis cardiac cine MRI,
which has more complex myocardium appearances and motions than short-axis.
Compared with other methods, AATracker significantly improves the tracking
performance and provides visually more realistic tracking results,
demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed weakly-supervision scheme in

Repeated compression and relaxation is the origin of much of the plasma
dynamics and intermittency in the near-earth environment. An observable
manifestation of compression is the thinning of the plasma sheet resulting in
magnetic reconnection when the solar wind mass, energy, and momentum floods
into the magnetosphere culminating in the spectacular auroral display. This
phenomenon is rich in physics at all scale sizes, which are causally
interconnected. This poses a formidable challenge in accurately modeling the
physics. The large-scale processes are fluid-like and are reasonably well
captured in the global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models, but those in the
smaller scales responsible for dissipation and relaxation that feed back to the
larger scale dynamics are often in the kinetic regime. The self-consistent
generation of the small-scale processes and their feedback to the global plasma
dynamics remains to be fully explored. Plasma compression can lead to the
generation of electromagnetic fields that distort the particle orbits and
introduce new features beyond the purview of the MHD framework, such as
ambipolar electric fields, unequal plasma drifts and currents among species,
strong spatial and velocity gradients in gyroscale layers separating plasmas of
different characteristics, \textit{etc.} These boundary layers are regions of

better tracking performance when compared with Gaussian attitude filters and

filter design is the selection of error criteria. The conventional design of
nonlinear attitude filters has a trade-off between fast adaptation and
robustness. In this work, a new functional approach based on fuzzy rules for
on-line continuous tuning of the nonlinear attitude filter adaptation gain is
proposed. The input and output membership functions are optimally tuned using
artificial bee colony optimization algorithm taking into account both attitude
error and rate of change of attitude error. The proposed approach results of
high adaptation gain at large error and small adaptation gain at small error.
Thereby, the proposed approach allows fast convergence properties with high
measures of robustness. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed
approach offers robust and high convergence capabilities against large error in

transport equation (PBE). However, solving the PBE for a general space-time
dependent problem remains a challenging task due to the high dimensionality of
the integro-differential equation. In this work, we present a direct solution
to the space-time dependent PBE with a linearized collision matrix using an
eigendecomposition method. We show that there exists a generalized Fourier type
relation that links heat flux to the local temperature, and this constitutive
relation defines a thermal conductivity that depends on both time and space.
Combining this approach with ab initio calculations of phonon properties, we
demonstrate that the space-time dependent thermal conductivity gives rise to an
oscillatory response in temperature in a transient grating geometry in high
thermal conductivity materials. The present solution method allows us to extend
the reach of our computational capability for heat conduction to space-time
dependent nondiffusive transport regimes. This capability will not only enable
a more accurate interpretation of thermal measurements that observe nonlocal
thermal transport but also enhance our physical understanding of nonlocal
thermal transport in high thermal conductivity materials that are promising

for the origin of Type Ib and Ic supernovae (SNe). Here, we follow a heuristic
approach by examining the fate of helium stars in the mass range 4 to 12Msun,
which presumably form in interacting binaries. The helium stars are evolved
using stellar wind mass loss rates that agree with observations, and which
reproduce the observed luminosity range of galactic WR stars, leading to
stellar masses at core collapse in the range 3-5.5Msun. We then explode these
models adopting an explosion energy proportional to the ejecta mass, roughly
consistent with theoretical predictions. We impose a fixed 56Ni mass and strong
mixing. The SN radiation from 3 to 100d is computed self-consistently starting
from the input stellar models using the time-dependent non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium radiative-transfer code CMFGEN. By design, our fiducial models
yield similar light curves, with a rise time of ~20d and a peak luminosity of
~10^42.2erg/s, in line with representative SNe Ibc. The less massive
progenitors retain a He-rich envelope and reproduce the color, line widths, and
line strengths of a representative sample of SNe Ib, while stellar winds remove
most of the helium in more massive progenitors, whose spectra match typical SNe
Ic in detail. The transition between the predicted Ib-like and Ic-like spectra
is continuous, but it is sharp, such that the resulting models essentially form
a dichotomy. Further models computed with varying explosion energy, 56Ni mass,
and long-term power injection from the remnant show that a moderate variation
of these parameters can reproduce much of the diversity of SNe Ibc. We conclude
that stars stripped by a binary companion can account for the vast majority of
ordinary SNe Ib and Ic, and that stellar wind mass loss is the key to remove
the helium envelope in SN Ic progenitors. [abridged]

commutes with arbitrary intersection of ideals, or equivalently if for any
element $f\in S$, there is a unique smallest ideal of $R$ whose extension to

analyze whether the completion map is Ohm-Rush. We show that the answer is
typically `yes' in dimension one, but `no' in higher dimension, and in any case
it coincides with the content map having good algebraic properties. We then
analyze the question of when the Ohm-Rush property globalizes in faithfully
flat modules and algebras over a 1-dimensional Noetherian domain, culminating
both in a positive result and a counterexample. Finally, we introduce a notion
that we show is strictly between the Ohm-Rush property and the weak content

cross-shelf SSH transition from positive values near coastline to low values
between 200m and 2km and back to positive offshore from the 2km isobath.
Zonally-paired cyclonic and anticyclonic structures are embedded in this
transition, causing the cLCSs to deform into chevrons. An transport barrier is
identified close to the 200m isobath confirmed by limited inshore movement of
drogued buoys and indicated by an along slope maxima of climatological strength
of attraction (cp). We show that the persistent cyclonic and anticyclonic

coincide with large shelves and with stagnant synthetic trajectories. We show
that cLCSs depict trajectories initiated at the location of Chevron spill (Nov.

basal coupling mediates flagellar coordination remains unclear. Here, we
examine the role of basal coupling in the synchronization of the model

sufficient to achieve inphase, antiphase, and bistable synchrony, even in the

reached by modulating the activity level of the individual flagella or the
strength of the basal coupling. We observe a slip mode when allowing for
differential flagellar activity, just as in experiments with live cells. We
introduce a dimensionless ratio of flagellar activity to basal coupling that is
predictive of the mode of synchrony. This ratio allows us to query biological

Moreover, mass effects as observed for brain tumors may displace tissue,
creating larger deformations over time than what is observed in a healthy
brain. Deep learning models have successfully been applied to image
registration to offer dramatic speed up and to use surrogate information (e.g.,
segmentations) during training. However, existing approaches focus on learning
registration models using images from healthy patients. They are therefore not
designed for the registration of images with strong pathologies for example in
the context of brain tumors, and traumatic brain injuries. In this work, we
explore a deep learning approach to register images with brain tumors to an

atlas, while simultaneously predicting the transformation to atlas space. Using
separate decoders, the network disentangles the tumor mass effect from the

while satisfying hard safety constraints at all times. Implementing an optimal
control solution is limited by the computational cost required to derive it in

rely on simple linear dynamics, simple objective functions, and ignoring noise.
The recently proposed Control Barrier Function (CBF) method may be used for
safety-critical control at the expense of sub-optimal performance. In this
paper, we develop a real-time control framework that combines optimal
trajectories generated through optimal control with the computationally
efficient CBF method providing safety guarantees. We use Hamiltonian analysis
to obtain a tractable optimal solution for a linear or linearized system, then
employ High Order CBFs (HOCBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) to
account for constraints with arbitrary relative degrees and to track the
optimal state, respectively. We further show how to deal with noise in
arbitrary relative degree systems. The proposed framework is then applied to
the optimal traffic merging problem for Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs)
where the objective is to jointly minimize the travel time and energy
consumption of each CAV subject to speed, acceleration, and speed-dependent
safety constraints. In addition, when considering more complex objective
functions, nonlinear dynamics and passenger comfort requirements for which
analytical optimal control solutions are unavailable, we adapt the HOCBF method
to such problems. Simulation examples are included to compare the performance
of the proposed framework to optimal solutions (when available) and to a

The level structures of neutron-rich 93,94,95Sr were studied via the

States were identified by gating on the excitation energy and, if possible, the

two shapes. For the d(96Sr,t)95Sr reaction the agreement with the shell model
is less good. The configuration of the ground state of 96Sr is already more

Type Ia supernovae presented by Zheng et al. (2018) to examine maximum-light
correlations in a four-dimensional (4-D) parameter space: $B$-band absolute
magnitude, $M_B$, \ion{Si}{2}~$\lambda6355$ velocity, \vsi, and \ion{Si}{2}
pseudo-equivalent widths pEW(\ion{Si}{2}~$\lambda6355$) and
pEW(\ion{Si}{2}~$\lambda5972$). It is shown using Gaussian mixture models
(GMMs) that the original four groups in the Branch diagram are well-defined and
robust in this parameterization. We find three continuous groups that describe
the behavior of our sample in [$M_B$, \vsi] space. Extending the GMM into the
full 4-D space yields a grouping system that only slightly alters group
definitions in the [$M_B$, \vsi] projection, showing that most of the
clustering information in [$M_B$, \vsi] is already contained in the 2-D GMM
groupings. However, the full 4-D space does divide group membership for faster
objects between core-normal and broad-line objects in the Branch diagram. A
significant correlation between $M_B$ and pEW(\ion{Si}{2}~$\lambda5972$) is
found, which implies that Branch group membership can be well-constrained by
spectroscopic quantities alone. In general, we find that higher-dimensional
GMMs reduce the uncertainty of group membership for objects between the
originally defined Branch groups. We also find that the broad-line Branch group
becomes nearly distinct with the inclusion of \vsi, indicating that this
subclass of SNe Ia may be somehow different from the other groups.

of people sing simultaneously in polyphonic harmony. The most commonly
practiced setting for choir ensembles consists of four parts; Soprano, Alto,
Tenor and Bass (SATB), each with its own range of fundamental frequencies
(F$0$s). The task of source separation for this choral setting entails
separating the SATB mixture into the constituent parts. Source separation for
musical mixtures is well studied and many deep learning based methodologies
have been proposed for the same. However, most of the research has been focused
on a typical case which consists in separating vocal, percussion and bass
sources from a mixture, each of which has a distinct spectral structure. In
contrast, the simultaneous and harmonic nature of ensemble singing leads to
high structural similarity and overlap between the spectral components of the
sources in a choral mixture, making source separation for choirs a harder task
than the typical case. This, along with the lack of an appropriate consolidated
dataset has led to a dearth of research in the field so far. In this paper we
first assess how well some of the recently developed methodologies for musical
source separation perform for the case of SATB choirs. We then propose a novel
domain-specific adaptation for conditioning the recently proposed U-Net
architecture for musical source separation using the fundamental frequency
contour of each of the singing groups and demonstrate that our proposed
approach surpasses results from domain-agnostic architectures.

After transforming a particle system into a spin system, in the large density

losses in an alternative device geometry, namely, the merged-element transmon
(mergemon). To this end, we replace the large external shunt capacitor of a
traditional transmon with the intrinsic capacitance of a Josephson junction

qubit-state dependent shift in the low power regime. The device also
demonstrates the single- and multi-photon transitions that represent a weakly

explained well with master-equation simulations. A participation ratio analysis
identifies the dielectric loss of the a-Si tunnel barrier and its interfaces as
the dominant source for qubit relaxation. We expect the mergemon to achieve

the conditional density function. We provide two examples of machine learning

achieve computational efficiency we propose a case-control sampling

map from the coefficient space of polynomials to the root space, focussing on
the quadratic and cubic cases. The geometry describes and explains notable
features of the illustrations, and motivates a geometric-minded recasting of
fundamental results in the Diophantine approximation of the complex plane. The
images provide a case-study in the symbiosis of illustration and research, and
an entry-point to geometry and number theory for a wider audience. The paper is
written to provide an accessible introduction to the study of homogeneous
geometry and Diophantine approximation.
  We investigate the homogeneous geometry of root and coefficient spaces under
the natural $\operatorname{PSL}(2;\mathbb{C})$ action, especially in degrees 2
and 3. We rediscover the quadratic and cubic root formulas as isometries, and
determine when the map sending certain families of polynomials to their complex
roots (our starscape images) are embeddings.
  We consider complex Diophantine approximation by quadratic irrationals, in
terms of hyperbolic distance and the discriminant as a measure of arithmetic
height. We recover the quadratic case of results of Bugeaud and Evertse, and
give some geometric explanation for the dichotomy they discovered (Bugeaud, Y.
and Evertse, J.-H., Approximation of complex algebraic numbers by algebraic
numbers of bounded degree, Ann. Sc. Norm. Super. Pisa Cl. Sci. (5) 8 (2009),
no. 2, 333-368). Our statements go a little further in distinguishing
approximability in terms of whether the target or approximations lie on
rational geodesics.
  The paper comes with accompanying software, and finishes with a wide variety
of open problems.

by the complementary benefits of the dc-based matching and ac-based
grid-forming controls as well as ideas from direct angle control and nonlinear

approach allows one to draw qualitative conclusions about the sign or relative
importance of the various contributions to the flux, the nonlinear simulations
quantitatively determine the size of the turbulent flux and check the extent to
which the quasilinear conclusions hold. Although the bulk of the nonlinear

However, traditional feature selection methods are only capable of processing

processing needs. These needs require a new category of data processing
algorithms called privacy-preserving feature selection, which protects users'
data by not revealing any part of the data neither in the intermediate
processing nor in the final results. This is vital for the datasets which
contain individuals' data, such as medical datasets. Therefore, it is rational
to either modify the existing algorithms or propose new ones to not only
introduce the capability of being applied to distributed datasets, but also act
responsibly in handling users' data by protecting their privacy. In this paper,
we will review three privacy-preserving feature selection methods and provide
suggestions to improve their performance when any gap is identified. We will

between quark-antiquark and quark-quark interaction channels has significance
on the phase structure when the mean-field approximation is employed, and the
baryon number density gives a tight constraint on the weighting factor of

the color superconducting phase transition is of the second-order and takes

adaptation strategies such as residual learning can help improve the overall

the stability issue in media with strong contrasts in medium properties. We
develop a stable and accurate hybrid eikonal solver for 2D and 3D transversely
isotropic media with a tilted symmetry axis (TTI, or tilted transversely
isotropic media). Our new eikonal solver combines the traveltime field
factorization technique, the third-order Lax-Friedrichs update scheme, and a
new method for computing the base traveltime field. The solver has the
following three advantages. First, there is no need to assign exact traveltime
values in the near-source region, and the computed traveltime field near the
source location is accurate even for TTI media with strong anisotropy. Second,
the computed traveltime field is high-order accurate in space. Third, the
solver is numerically stable for 2D and 3D TTI media with strong anisotropy,
complex structures, and strong contrasts in medium properties. We verify the
stability and accuracy of our hybrid eikonal solver using several 2D and 3D TTI

Adversarial attack is a recently revived domain which is shown to be effective
in breaking deep neural network-based classifiers, specifically, by forcing
them to change their posterior distribution by only perturbing the input
samples by a very small amount. Although, significant progress in this realm
has been made in the computer vision domain, advances within speaker
recognition is still limited. The present expository paper considers several
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks to a deep speaker recognition system,
employing strong defense methods as countermeasures, and reporting on several
ablation studies to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the problem. The
experiments show that the speaker recognition systems are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, and the strongest attacks can reduce the accuracy of the
system from 94% to even 0%. The study also compares the performances of the
employed defense methods in detail, and finds adversarial training based on
Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) to be the best defense method in our setting.

cluster richness, while the fraction of cluster galaxies that are
radio-luminous ($L_{1.4~\mathrm{GHz}}\geq10^{25}$~W~Hz$^{-1}$) does not
correlate with richness at a statistically significant level. Compared to that
calculated at $0 < z < 0.6$, the cluster radio-active fraction at $0 < z < 1.5$
increases by a factor of $10$. This fraction is also dependent on the radio
luminosity. Clusters at higher redshift are much more likely to host a radio
source of luminosity $L_{1.4~\mathrm{GHz}}\gtrsim10^{26}$~W~Hz$^{-1}$ than are
lower redshift clusters. We compare the fraction of radio-luminous cluster
galaxies to the fraction measured in a field environment. For $0.7<z<1.5$, we

""internal band gap"" between the principal band edges. The significance of this
electronic configuration is that it might be unstable towards the formation of
states inside the internal band gap when the formation of such states costs
less energy than the energy gained by transferring carriers from the conduction
band to these lower energy acceptor states, changing the original (false) metal
to an insulator.

spectroscopic properties of twisted bilayers of WSe2 and MoSe2 in the
H-stacking configuration using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Our
experiments reveal that the moir\'e potential in these bilayers at small angles
is unexpectedly large, reaching values of above 300 meV for the valence band
and 150 meV for the conduction band - an order of magnitude larger than
theoretical estimates based on interlayer coupling alone. We further
demonstrate that the moir\'e potential is a non-monotonic function of moir\'e
wavelength, reaching a maximum at around a 13nm moir\'e period. This
non-monotonicity coincides with a drastic change in the structure of the
moir\'e pattern from a continuous variation of stacking order at small moir\'e
wavelengths to a one-dimensional soliton dominated structure at large moir\'e
wavelengths. We show that the in-plane structure of the moir\'e pattern is
captured well by a continuous mechanical relaxation model, and find that the
moir\'e structure and internal strain rather than the interlayer coupling is
the dominant factor in determining the moir\'e potential. Our results
demonstrate the potential of using precision moir\'e structures to create
deeply trapped carriers or excitations for quantum electronics and

(tracks) such as drum, bass, string and guitar, and can make a song more
expressive and contagious by arranging together with its melody. Previous works
usually generate multiple tracks separately and the music notes from different
tracks not explicitly depend on each other, which hurts the harmony modeling.
To improve harmony, in this paper, we propose a novel MUlti-track MIDI
representation (MuMIDI), which enables simultaneous multi-track generation in a
single sequence and explicitly models the dependency of the notes from
different tracks. While this greatly improves harmony, unfortunately, it
enlarges the sequence length and brings the new challenge of long-term music
modeling. We further introduce two new techniques to address this challenge: 1)
We model multiple note attributes (e.g., pitch, duration, velocity) of a
musical note in one step instead of multiple steps, which can shorten the
length of a MuMIDI sequence. 2) We introduce extra long-context as memory to
capture long-term dependency in music. We call our system for pop music
accompaniment generation as PopMAG. We evaluate PopMAG on multiple datasets
(LMD, FreeMidi and CPMD, a private dataset of Chinese pop songs) with both
subjective and objective metrics. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of
PopMAG for multi-track harmony modeling and long-term context modeling.
Specifically, PopMAG wins 42\%/38\%/40\% votes when comparing with ground truth
musical pieces on LMD, FreeMidi and CPMD datasets respectively and largely
outperforms other state-of-the-art music accompaniment generation models and
multi-track MIDI representations in terms of subjective and objective metrics.

COVID-19 virus spreads. To determine whether a person has touched an object or
surface using visual data, images, or videos, is a hard problem. Computer
vision 3D reconstruction approaches project objects and the human body from the
2D image domain to 3D and perform 3D space intersection directly. However, this
solution would not meet the accuracy requirement in applications due to
projection error. Another standard approach is to train a neural network to
infer touch actions from the collected visual data. This strategy would require
significant amounts of training data to generalize over scale and viewpoint
variations. A different approach to this problem is to identify whether a
person has touched a defined object. In this work, we show that the solution to
this problem can be straightforward. Specifically, we show that the contact
between an object and a static surface can be identified by projecting the
object onto the static surface through two different viewpoints and analyzing
their 2D intersection. The object contacts the surface when the projected
points are close to each other; we call this cross view projection consistency.
Instead of doing 3D scene reconstruction or transfer learning from deep
networks, a mapping from the surface in the two camera views to the surface
space is the only requirement. For planar space, this mapping is the Homography
transformation. This simple method can be easily adapted to real-life
applications. In this paper, we apply our method to do office occupancy

encapsulates it such that our predicted unseen views possess good 3D
representations. We further explore the non-linear feature subspace and
conclude that our network does not operate in the Euclidean subspace but rather
in the Riemannian subspace. It does not learn the geometric transformation for
predicting the position of the pixel in the new image but rather learns the
manifold. To this end, we use t-SNE visualisations to conduct a detailed
analysis of our network and perform classification of generated images as a
low-shot learning task.

develop QML models designed for predicting the toxicity of 221 phenols on the

the dimensionality selected by SNML is significantly closer to the optimal
dimensionality obtained by word analogy or word similarity tasks.

localization-by-classification pipelines, i.e., the pre-classification pipeline
and the post-classification pipeline. The pre-classification pipeline first
performs classification on each video snippet and then aggregate the
snippet-level classification scores to obtain the video-level classification
score. In contrast, the post-classification pipeline aggregates the
snippet-level features first and then predicts the video-level classification
score based on the aggregated feature. Although the classifiers in these two
pipelines are used in different ways, the role they play is exactly the
same---to classify the given features to identify the corresponding action
categories. To this end, an ideal classifier can make both pipelines work. This
inspires us to simultaneously learn these two pipelines in a unified framework
to obtain an effective classifier. Specifically, in the proposed learning
framework, we implement two parallel network streams to model the two
localization-by-classification pipelines simultaneously and make the two
network streams share the same classifier. This achieves the novel Equivalent
Classification Mapping (ECM) mechanism. Moreover, we discover that an ideal
classifier may possess two characteristics: 1) The frame-level classification
scores obtained from the pre-classification stream and the feature aggregation
weights in the post-classification stream should be consistent; 2) The
classification results of these two streams should be identical. Based on these
two characteristics, we further introduce a weight-transition module and an
equivalent training strategy into the proposed learning framework, which
assists to thoroughly mine the equivalence mechanism.

Reasonable prediction results can assist people in planning and
decision-making, generate benefits and avoid risks. Normally, there are two
characteristics of time series, that is, long-term trend and short-term
fluctuation. For example, stock prices will have a long-term upward trend with
the market, but there may be a small decline in the short term. These two
characteristics are often relatively independent of each other. However, the
existing prediction methods often do not distinguish between them, which
reduces the accuracy of the prediction model. In this paper, a MTS forecasting
framework that can capture the long-term trends and short-term fluctuations of
time series in parallel is proposed. This method uses the original time series
and its first difference to characterize long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations. Three prediction sub-networks are constructed to predict
long-term trends, short-term fluctuations and the final value to be predicted.
In the overall optimization goal, the idea of multi-task learning is used for
reference, which is to make the prediction results of long-term trends and
short-term fluctuations as close to the real values as possible while requiring
to approximate the values to be predicted. In this way, the proposed method
uses more supervision information and can more accurately capture the changing
trend of the time series, thereby improving the forecasting performance.

problem aims to decompose a partially observed matrix into the superposition of
a low-rank matrix and a sparse matrix, where the sparse matrix captures the
grossly corrupted entries of the matrix. A widely used approach to tackle RMC
is to consider a convex formulation, which minimizes the nuclear norm of the
low-rank matrix (to promote low-rankness) and the l1 norm of the sparse matrix
(to promote sparsity). In this paper, motivated by some recent works on
low-rank matrix completion and Riemannian optimization, we formulate this
problem as a nonsmooth Riemannian optimization problem over Grassmann manifold.
This new formulation is scalable because the low-rank matrix is factorized to
the multiplication of two much smaller matrices. We then propose an alternating

common for brittle glasses. The key mechanism of viscoplastic deformation
involves interatomic bond switching, which is known to be a thermally activated
process. In this study, through systematic in-situ compression tests by
scanning electron microscopy, the viscoplastic deformation of amorphous silica
is observed without thermal activation. Furthermore, ductility does not
increase monotonically with acceleration voltage and current density of the SEM
e-beam but is maximized by a factor of three at a specific acceleration voltage
and current density conditions (compared to beam-off conditions). A Monte Carlo
simulation of the electron-matter interaction shows that the unique trends of
viscoplastic deformation correlate with the interaction volume, i.e., the
region within the material where inelastic electron scattering occurs. Changing
the size of the migrating atomic clusters can lead to facility in
rearrangements of the intramolecular bonds, hence leading to more sustained
bond switching. Based on the interaction volume the mechanical shaping of
small-scale amorphous silica structures under e-beam irradiation can be modeled
with high-precision supporting the idea that this relatively low-voltage

function by a new scalar function with the same phase but different modulus,
and particle momentum operator built on covariant derivative, with a connection
of purely imaginary velocity field that is identified as the gravitational
escape velocity. Three quantum metric functions are defined to signify the
kinematic change of quantum state brought by gravity. The modified equivalence
principle enables us to relate the escape velocity field with the quantum

system: We analyzed lines of code, commits, new projects, and the number of
open-source contributors over the last 30 years in the known open-source
universe.
  Results: We found growth of open source to be exhausted: After an initial
exponential growth, all measurements show a monotonic downwards trend since its
peak in 2013. None of the existing growth models could stand the test of time.
  Conclusion: Our results raise more questions on the growth of open source and
the representativeness of Open Hub as a proxy for describing open source. We
discuss multiple interpretations for our observations and encourage further
research using alternative data sets.

based on the Surface Brightness Fluctuations (SBF) method, aimed at measuring
the value of the Hubble constant. We build a sample of calibrating anchors
consisting of 24 SNe hosted in galaxies having SBF distance measurements.
Applying a hierarchical Bayesian approach, we calibrate the SNe luminosity and
extend it into the Hubble flow by using a sample of 96 SNe Ia in the redshift
range $0.02 < z < 0.075$, extracted from the Combined Pantheon Sample. We
estimate a value of $H_0 = 70.50 \pm 2.37(stat) \pm 3.38(sys)$ $\text{km}\
\text{s}^{-1}\ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ (i.e. $3.4\% stat, 4.8\% sys$), which is in
agreement with the value obtained using the tip of the red giant branch
calibration, and consistent within the errors with the value obtained from SNe
Type Ia calibrated with Cepheids and the one inferred from the analysis of the
cosmic microwave background. We find that the SNe Ia distance moduli calibrated
with SBF are on average larger by 0.07 mag than the ones calibrated with
Cepheids. Our results point to possible differences among SNe in different
types of galaxies, which could originate from different local environments
and/or SNe Ia progenitor properties. Sampling different host galaxy type, SBF
offers a complementary approach to Cepheids which is important in addressing
possible systematics. As the SBF method has the ability to reach larger
distances than Cepheids, the impending entry of LSST and JWST into operation
will increase the number of SNe Ia hosted in galaxies where SBF distances can
be measured, making SBF measurements attractive for improving the calibration
of SNe Ia, and in the estimation of $H_0$.

(Ca$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$)Pd$_3$P. Three perovskite-related crystal structures were
identified in (Ca$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$)Pd$_3$P and a phase diagram was built on the
basis of experimental results. The first phase transition from centrosymmetric
($Pnma$) to non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic ($Aba$2) occurred in CaPd$_3$P
near room temperature. The phase transition temperature decreased as Ca$^{2+}$
was replaced with a larger-sized isovalent Sr$^{2+}$. Bulk superconductivity at
a critical temperature ($T$$_c$) of approximately 3.5 K was observed in a range
of $x$ = 0.17 - 0.55; this was associated with the centrosymmetric orthorhombic
phase. Thereafter, a non-centrosymmetric tetragonal phase ($I$41$md$) remained
stable for 0.6 $\leq$ $x$ $\leq$ 1.0, and superconductivity was significantly
suppressed as samples with $x$ = 0.75 and 1.0 showed ($T$$_c$) values as low as
0.32 K and 57 mK, respectively. For further substitution with a larger-sized
isovalent Ba$^{2+}$, namely (Sr$_{1-y}$Ba$_y$)Pd$_3$P, the tetragonal phase
continued throughout the composition range. BaPd$_3$P no longer showed
superconductivity down to 20 mK. Since the inversion symmetry of structure and
superconductivity can be precisely controlled in (Ca$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$)Pd$_3$P,
this material may offer a unique opportunity to study the relationship between
inversion symmetry and superconductivity.

momentum fluxes in the tropical upper troposphere are studied. In zonal mean,
these two terms oppose each other and peak during the Indian summer monsoon.
This zonal mean character arises from a rich longitudinal structure that is
revealed by splitting the globe into three zones, namely, the Asia-West Pacific
(AWP), central Pacific-West Atlantic (CP-WA) and African sectors. The mean
convergence term is cohesive across all three regions, has a single peak in the
boreal summer and always acts to decelerate the zonal flow. A Helmholtz
decomposition shows that the advection of absolute vorticity by the divergent
meridional wind in localized cross-equatorial cells is responsible for the
coherent nature of the mean convergence across all sectors.
  On the other hand, the eddy convergence goes from being small and seasonally
invariant in the African region to one with large seasonal maxima (minima) in
AWP (CP-WA) sector that accelerate (decelerate) the zonal mean flow. The
disparate nature the eddy flux in the AWP and CP-WA regions is in the winter
season and is due to the tropical and extratropical origin of waves,
respectively. In summer, the AWP region accounts for almost all of the eddy
flux convergence. In fact, the leading role of the rotational zonal - divergent
meridional component in the zonal mean eddy flux does not hold in individual
sectors. Finally, through the year, the CP-WA region is where the local
overturning cell is strongly influenced by eddy activity.

vector boson interacts with ordinary fermions through vector and axial-vector
couplings. As a consequence of Ward-Takahashi identity, $Z_d$ is transversely
polarized in the limit $m_{Z_d}\ll \sqrt{s}$. On the other hand, the fraction
of longitudinal $Z_d$ is non-negligible for $m_{Z_d}$ comparable to $\sqrt{s}$.
Such polarization effects can be analyzed through angular distributions of
final-state particles in $Z_d$ decays. Taking $l^{\pm}\equiv \mu^{\pm}$, we
study the correlation between $Z_d$ angle relative to $e^-$ beam direction in
$e^+e^-$ CM frame and $\mu^-$ angle relative to the boost direction of $Z_d$ in

In this paper, we formulate this novel RL problem, in which an objective
function, which encodes a notion of fairness that we formally define, is
optimized. For this problem, we provide a theoretical discussion where we
examine the case of discounted rewards and that of average rewards. During this
analysis, we notably derive a new result in the standard RL setting, which is
of independent interest: it states a novel bound on the approximation error
with respect to the optimal average reward of that of a policy optimal for the
discounted reward. Since learning with discounted rewards is generally easier,
this discussion further justifies finding a fair policy for the average reward
by learning a fair policy for the discounted reward. Thus, we describe how
several classic deep RL algorithms can be adapted to our fair optimization
problem, and we validate our approach with extensive experiments in three
different domains.

the background plasma, resulting in electron heating and scattering. We study
the electrostatic waves and electron heating observed over the lunar magnetic
anomalies by analyzing data from the Acceleration, Reconnection, Turbulence,
and Electrodynamics of Moon's Interaction with the Sun (ARTEMIS) spacecraft.
Based on the analysis of two lunar flybys in 2011 and 2013, we find that the
electron two-stream instability (ETSI) and electron cyclotron drift instability
(ECDI) may play an important role in driving the electrostatic waves. We also
find that ECDI, along with the modified two-stream instability (MTSI), may
provide the mechanisms responsible for substantial isotropic electron heating
over the lunar magnetic anomalies.

31 headwater subwatersheds belonging to the Duero River Basin, located in the
Iberian Peninsula, through a three-part approach: (1) the calibration and
validation of the VIC model for all the subwatersheds; (2) an integrated
sensitivity analysis concerning the soil parameters chosen for the calibration,
and (3) an assessment of equifinality and the efficiency of the calibration
algorithm. The calibration and validation processes showed good results for
most of the subwatersheds in a computationally efficient way using the
Shuffled-Complex-Evolution algorithm. The sensitivity measures were obtained
with the Standardized Regression Coefficients method through a post-process of
the outputs of a Monte Carlo simulation carried out for 10 000 parameter
samples for each subwatershed. This allowed to quantify the sensitivity of the
water balance components to the selected parameters for the calibration and
understanding the strong dependencies between them. The final assessment of the
equifinality hypothesis manifested that there are many parameter samples with
performances as good as the optimum, calculated using the calibration
algorithm. For almost all the analyzed subwatersheds the calibration algorithm
resulted efficient, reaching the optimal fit. Both the Monte Carlo simulation
and the use of a calibration algorithm will be of interest for other feasible
applications of the VIC model in other river basins.

the security of password-based authentication by protecting against credential
stuffing, password guessing, or phishing attacks. RBA monitors extra features
during login and requests for an additional authentication step if the observed
feature values deviate from the usual ones in the login history. In
state-of-the-art RBA re-authentication deployments, users receive an email with
a numerical code in its body, which must be entered on the online service.
Although this procedure has a major impact on RBA's time exposure and
usability, these aspects were not studied so far.
  We introduce two RBA re-authentication variants supplementing the de facto
standard with a link-based and another code-based approach. Then, we present
the results of a between-group study (N=592) to evaluate these three
approaches. Our observations show with significant results that there is
potential to speed up the RBA re-authentication process without reducing
neither its security properties nor its security perception. The link-based
re-authentication via ""magic links"", however, makes users significantly more
anxious than the code-based approaches when perceived for the first time. Our
evaluations underline the fact that RBA re-authentication is not a uniform
procedure. We summarize our findings and provide recommendations.

sequences into sessions according to the time interval, and use the field-aware

hierarchical network composed of time-aware GRU and user-item-aware GRU to
capture users' short-term intentions and users' long-term habits, which can be
regarded as a supplement to user profile. The proposed model can improve the

particle filter based methodologies to estimate the score function. Both
methods rely on an online estimation algorithm for the score function of
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ cost, with $N\in\mathbb{N}$ the number of particles. The
first approach employs a simple Euler discretization and standard particle
smoothers and is of cost $\mathcal{O}(N^2 + N\Delta_l^{-1})$ per unit time,
where $\Delta_l=2^{-l}$, $l\in\mathbb{N}_0$, is the time-discretization step.
The second approach is new and based upon a novel diffusion bridge
construction. It yields a new backward type Feynman-Kac formula in
continuous-time for the score function and is presented along with a particle
method for its approximation. Considering a time-discretization, the cost is
$\mathcal{O}(N^2\Delta_l^{-1})$ per unit time. To improve computational costs,
we then consider multilevel methodologies for the score function. We illustrate
our parameter estimation method via stochastic gradient approaches in several

and the location of the critical points (sublattice magnetisations vanish,
leading to zero bulk magnetisation) and the compensation points (bulk

estimated. Close range simulations with variable lattice sizes for compensation
point and Binder's cumulant crossing technique for critical points are employed
for analysis and conditions for the existence of compensation points are
determined. Comprehensive phase diagrams are obtained in the Hamiltonian

and convergence properties. This construction is inspired in the classical

considers the uncentered Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator $\widetilde{M}$

is the electron-pairing. The induced current by a magnetic field is calculated
by the linear response to the vector potential, and the supercurrent is
identified as the dissipationless flow of the paired-electrons, while single
electrons flow with dissipation. This supercurrent description suffers from the
following serious problems: 1) it contradicts the reversible
superconducting-normal phase transition in a magnetic field observed in type I
superconductors; 2) the gauge invariance of the supercurrent induced by a
magnetic field requires the breakdown of the global $U(1)$ gauge invariance, or
the non-conservation of the particle number; 3) the explanation of the ac
Josephson effect is based on the boundary condition that is different from the
real experimental one.
  We will show that above problems are resolved if the supercurrent is
attributed to the collective mode arising from the Berry connection for
many-body wave functions. The problem 1) is resolved by attributing the
appearance and disappearance of the supercurrent to the abrupt appearance and
disappearance of topologically-protected loop currents produced by the Berry
connection; the problem 2) is resolved by assigning the non-conserved number to
that for the particle number participating in the collective mode produced by
the Berry connection; and the problem 3) is resolved by identifying the
relevant phase in the Josephson effect is that arising from the Berry
connection, and using the modified Bogoliubov transformation that conserves the
particle number.

an alarm when the measured samples deviate from the training data distribution.
This means that the samples used to train the model should be sufficient in
quantity and representative of the healthy operating conditions. But for
industrial systems subject to changing operating conditions, acquiring such
comprehensive sets of samples requires a long collection period and delay the
point at which the anomaly detector can be trained and put in operation.
  A solution to this problem is to perform unsupervised transfer learning
(UTL), to transfer complementary data between different units. In the
literature however, UTL aims at finding common structure between the datasets,
to perform clustering or dimensionality reduction. Yet, the task of
transferring and combining complementary training data has not been studied.
  Our proposed framework is designed to transfer complementary operating
conditions between different units in a completely unsupervised way to train
more robust anomaly detectors. It differs, thereby, from other unsupervised
transfer learning works as it focuses on a one-class classification problem.
The proposed methodology enables to detect anomalies in operating conditions
only experienced by other units. The proposed end-to-end framework uses
adversarial deep learning to ensure alignment of the different units'
distributions. The framework introduces a new loss, inspired by a
dimensionality reduction tool, to enforce the conservation of the inherent
variability of each dataset, and uses state-of-the art once-class approach to
detect anomalies. We demonstrate the benefit of the proposed framework using
three open source datasets.

sequences leads to the development of a multiscale ligation landscape. A
position-dependent sequence pattern emerged with a segregation into mutually

with energy higher than the band gap initially generate hot electrons and
holes, which subsequently cool down to the band edge by phonon emission. Due to
the latter process, the energy of the charge carriers in excess of the band gap
is lost as heat and does not contribute to the conversion of solar to
electrical power. If the excess energy is more than the band gap it can in
principle be utilized through a process known as carrier multiplication (CM) in
which a single absorbed photon generates two (or more) pairs of electrons and
holes. Thus, through CM the photon energy above twice the band gap enhances the
photocurrent of a solar cell. In this review, we discuss recent progress in CM
research in terms of fundamental understanding, emergence of new materials for
efficient CM, and CM based solar cell applications. Based on our current
understanding, the CM threshold can get close to the minimal value of twice the
band gap in materials where a photon induces an asymmetric electronic
transition from a deeper valence band or to a higher conduction band. In
addition, the material must have a low exciton binding energy and high charge
carrier mobility, so that photoexcitation leads directly to the formation of
free charges that can readily be extracted at external electrodes of a
photovoltaic device. Percolative networks of coupled PbSe quantum dots, Sn/Pb

very different from that of the widely studied $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid state.
However, we find that the physical spin fluctuation spectrum calculated from
the Gutzwiller projected RPA(GRPA) theory above such an RVB state is actually
gapless and is almost identical to that above the $U(1)$ Dirac spin liquid
state. We find that such a peculiar behavior can be attributed to the unique
flat band physics on the Kagome lattice, which makes the mapping between the
mean field ansatz and the RVB state non-injective. We find that the spin
fluctuation spectrum of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ KAFH is not at all featureless,

unpolarized diffuse emission that permeates the Galactic center region. In a
real observation, also the morphological smearing of the source due to the

diluting the polarization degree. So far, these effects have never been

We find that in the 4.0-8.0 keV band, where the emission of the molecular

  Models","accepted to BMVC2020",,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Predicting a scene graph that captures visual entities and their interactions
in an image has been considered a crucial step towards full scene
comprehension. Recent scene graph generation (SGG) models have shown their
capability of capturing the most frequent relations among visual entities.
However, the state-of-the-art results are still far from satisfactory, e.g.
models can obtain 31% in overall recall R@100, whereas the likewise important
mean class-wise recall mR@100 is only around 8% on Visual Genome (VG). The
discrepancy between R and mR results urges to shift the focus from pursuing a
high R to a high mR with a still competitive R. We suspect that the observed
discrepancy stems from both the annotation bias and sparse annotations in VG,
in which many visual entity pairs are either not annotated at all or only with
a single relation when multiple ones could be valid. To address this particular
issue, we propose a novel SGG training scheme that capitalizes on self-learned
knowledge. It involves two relation classifiers, one offering a less biased
setting for the other to base on. The proposed scheme can be applied to most of
the existing SGG models and is straightforward to implement. We observe
significant relative improvements in mR (between +6.6% and +20.4%) and
competitive or better R (between -2.4% and 0.3%) across all standard SGG tasks.

is an attack that can mislead state-of-the-art classifiers into making an
incorrect classification with high confidence by deliberately perturbing the
original inputs, raises concerns about the robustness of DNNs to such attacks.
Adversarial training, which is the main heuristic method for improving
adversarial robustness and the first line of defense against adversarial
attacks, requires many sample-by-sample calculations to increase training size
and is usually insufficiently strong for an entire network. This paper provides
a new perspective on the issue of adversarial robustness, one that shifts the
focus from the network as a whole to the critical part of the region close to
the decision boundary corresponding to a given class. From this perspective, we
propose a method to generate a single but image-agnostic adversarial
perturbation that carries the semantic information implying the directions to
the fragile parts on the decision boundary and causes inputs to be
misclassified as a specified target. We call the adversarial training based on
such perturbations ""region adversarial training"" (RAT), which resembles
classical adversarial training but is distinguished in that it reinforces the
semantic information missing in the relevant regions. Experimental results on
the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets show that this approach greatly improves
adversarial robustness even using a very small dataset from the training data;
moreover, it can defend against FGSM adversarial attacks that have a completely
different pattern from the model seen during retraining.

previous biomarkers cannot accurately predict glucodensity, so that the latter
is a richer source of information, and iii) the glucodensity is a natural

handling of CGM data. Furthermore, the new method overcomes many of the
drawbacks of time in range metrics, and provides deeper insight into assessing

the multi-element approach and ensure the preservation of hyperbolic solutions
through the hyperbolicity limiter. In addition to that, we study the intrusive
polynomial moment method, which guarantees hyperbolicity at the cost of solving
an optimization problem in every spatial cell and every time step. To reduce
numerical costs, we apply the multi-element ansatz to IPM. This ansatz
decouples the optimization problems of all multi elements. Thus, we are able to
significantly decrease computational costs while improving parallelizability.
We finally evaluate these oscillation mitigating approaches on various
numerical examples such as a NACA airfoil and a nozzle test case for the
two-dimensional Euler equations. In our numerical experiments, we observe the
mitigation of spurious artifacts. Furthermore, using the multi-element ansatz
for IPM significantly reduces computational costs.

diagnostics: electron anisotropy (velocity angle to the guiding magnetic field)
and the high energy cutoff (highest energy electrons produced by the
acceleration conditions: mechanism, spatial extent, time), are important
quantities that can help to constrain electron acceleration at the Sun but both
are poorly determined. Here, using electron and X-ray transport simulations
that account for both collisional and non-collisional transport processes such
as turbulent scattering, and X-ray albedo, we show that X-ray polarization can
be used to constrain the anisotropy of the accelerated electron distribution
and the most energetic accelerated electrons together. Moreover, we show that
prospective missions, e.g. CubeSat missions without imaging information, can be

a fuller understanding of flare acceleration processes will come from missions

spectro-polarimeters without imaging can also provide strong constraints on

distribution of microscopic momentum relaxation times. The macroscopic response
time depends on average and variation of this distribution; the observed
deviation between response time and conductivity scaling corresponds to the
scaling of the variation. The variation of microscopic relaxation times depends
on film thickness because electrons with different relaxation times are
affected differently by the confinement since they have different mean free
paths.

from data sparsity problem. Since it overemphasizes the final performance, the
association or fusion between context data and sequence data has not been well
captured and utilized for sequential recommendation. To tackle this problem, we
propose the model S^3-Rec, which stands for Self-Supervised learning for

main idea of our approach is to utilize the intrinsic data correlation to
derive self-supervision signals and enhance the data representations via
pre-training methods for improving sequential recommendation. For our task, we
devise four auxiliary self-supervised objectives to learn the correlations
among attribute, item, subsequence, and sequence by utilizing the mutual

characterize the correlation between different types of data, which is
particularly suitable in our scenario. Extensive experiments conducted on six

many others. In this work, we are particularly interested in analyzing how
multi-agent reinforcement learning can bridge the gap to reality in distributed
multi-robot systems where the operation of the different robots is not
necessarily homogeneous. These variations can happen due to sensing mismatches,
inherent errors in terms of calibration of the mechanical joints, or simple
differences in accuracy. While our results are simulation-based, we introduce
the effect of sensing, calibration, and accuracy mismatches in distributed
reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimization (PPO). We discuss on
how both the different types of perturbances and how the number of agents
experiencing those perturbances affect the collaborative learning effort. The
simulations are carried out using a Kuka arm model in the Bullet physics
engine. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first work exploring the
limitations of PPO in multi-robot systems when considering that different
robots might be exposed to different environments where their sensors or
actuators have induced errors. With the conclusions of this work, we set the

causal order admit the existence of causally indefinite processes, where it is
impossible to ascribe causal order for events A and B. These frameworks even
allow for processes that violate the so-called causal inequalities, which are
analogous to Bell's inequalities. However, the physicality of these exotic
processes is, in the general case, still under debate, bringing into question
their foundational relevance. While it is known that causally indefinite
processes can be probabilistically realised by means of a quantum circuit,
along with an additional conditioning event C, concrete insights into the
ontological meaning of such implementation schemes have heretofore been
limited. Here, we show that causally indefinite processes can be realised with
schemes where C serves only as a classical flag heralding which causally
indefinite process was realised. We then show that there are processes where
any pure conditioning measurement of C leads to a causally indefinite process
for A and B, thus establishing causal indefiniteness as a basis-independent
quantity. Finally, we demonstrate that quantum mechanics allows for phenomena
where C can deterministically decide whether A comes before B or vice versa,
without signalling to either. This is akin to Wheeler's famous delayed-choice
experiment establishing definite causal order in quantum mechanics as

evidence with respect to treatment effect on AE risk into categories, the
choice of the estimator is key and more important than features of the
underlying data such as percentage of censoring, CEs, amount of follow-up, or
value of the gold-standard RR. There is an urgent need to improve the
guidelines of reporting AEs so that incidence proportions are finally replaced
by the Aalen-Johansen estimator - rather than by Kaplan-Meier - with
appropriate definition of CEs. For RRs based on hazards, the HR based on Cox

clinical trials through the use of survival techniques appropriately dealing

methodologies have advanced, in AE analyses often the incidence proportion, the
incidence density, or a non-parametric Kaplan-Meier estimator (KME) are used,
which either ignore censoring or CEs. In an empirical study including
randomized clinical trials from several sponsor organisations, these potential
sources of bias are investigated. The main aim is to compare the estimators
that are typically used in AE analysis to the Aalen-Johansen estimator (AJE) as
the gold-standard. Here, one-sample findings are reported, while a companion
paper considers consequences when comparing treatment groups. Estimators are
compared with descriptive statistics, graphical displays and with a random
effects meta-analysis. The influence of different factors on the size of the
bias is investigated in a meta-regression. Comparisons are conducted at the
maximum follow-up time and at earlier evaluation time points. CEs definition
does not only include death before AE but also end of follow-up for AEs due to
events possibly related to the disease course or the treatment. Ten sponsor
organisations provided 17 trials including 186 types of AEs. The one minus KME
was on average about 1.2-fold larger than the AJE. Leading forces influencing
bias were the amount of censoring and of CEs. As a consequence, the average
bias using the incidence proportion was less than 5%. Assuming constant hazards
using incidence densities was hardly an issue provided that CEs were accounted
for. There is a need to improve the guidelines of reporting risks of AEs so
that the KME and the incidence proportion are replaced by the AJE with an
appropriate definition of CEs.

project is to reduce the uncertainties of observational estimates of mass-loss
rates from Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars. Line emission from 12CO J=2-1
and 3-2 were mapped using the ACA. In this initial analysis, the emission
distribution was fit to a Gaussian distribution in the uv-plane. Detailed
radiative transfer analysis will be presented in the future. The axes of the
best-fit Gaussian at the line center of the 12CO J=2-1 emission gives a first
indication of the size of the emitting region. Furthermore, the fitting
results, such as the major and minor axis, center position, and the goodness of
fit across both lines, constrain the symmetry of the emission distribution. We
find that the CO envelope sizes are, in general, larger for C-type than for
M-type AGB stars, which is expected if the CO/H2 ratio is larger in C-type
stars. Furthermore, a relation between the 12CO J=2-1 size and circumstellar
density is shown that, while in broad agreement with photodissociation
calculations, reveals large scatter and systematic differences between the
stellar types. The majority of the sources have CO envelopes that are
consistent with a spherically symmetric, smooth outflow. For about a third of
the sources, indications of strong asymmetries are found. This is consistent
with previous interferometric investigations of northern sources. Smaller scale
asymmetries are found in a larger fraction of sources. These results for CO
envelope radii and shapes can be used to constrain detailed radiative transfer
modeling of the same stars so as to determine mass-loss rates that are
independent of photodissociation models. For a large fraction of the sources,
observations at higher spatial resolution will be necessary to further
investigate the complex circumstellar dynamics revealed by our ACA
observations.

attosecond sources, however, are often impaired by their low repetition rate
and the resulting insufficient statistics, especially when the number of
detectable events per shot is limited. This is the case for experiments where
several reaction products must be detected in coincidence, and for surface
science applications where space-charge effects compromise spectral and spatial
resolution.
  In this work, we present an attosecond light source operating at 200 kHz,
which opens up the exploration of phenomena previously inaccessible to
attosecond interferometric and spectroscopic techniques. Key to our approach is
the combination of a high repetition rate, few-cycle laser source, a specially
designed gas target for efficient high harmonic generation, a passively and
actively stabilized pump-probe interferometer and an advanced 3D
photoelectron/ion momentum detector. While most experiments in the field of
attosecond science so far have been performed with either single attosecond
pulses or long trains of pulses, we explore the hitherto mostly overlooked
intermediate regime with short trains consisting of only a few attosecond
pulses.e also present the first coincidence measurement of single-photon double
ionization of helium with full angular resolution, using an attosecond source.
This opens up for future studies of the dynamic evolution of strongly
correlated electrons.

  Detectors by Shifting Center of Scanning",,,,,"eess.IV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Lightfield Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (L-SPECT) system is
developed to overcome some of the drawbacks in conventional SPECT by applying
the idea of plenoptic imaging. This system displayed improved performance in
terms of reduced information loss and scanning time when compared to the SPECT
system which has a conventional collimator. The SPECT system is transformed
into L-SPECT system by replacing the conventional collimators with micro-range
multi-pinhole arrays. The field of view (FOV) of the L-SPECT system is enhanced
by reshaping the detector head into ring-type by tiling small detector modules.
The L-SPECT system with modular partial ring detectors (MPRD L-SPECT) exhibits
cylindrical artefacts during volumetric reconstruction. Hence, here the work is
focused to remove the cylindrical artefacts in the reconstruction of the
examined objects by changing the scanning orbit. The enhancement is done such
that the center of scanning of the L-SPECT system with MPRD L-SPECT is shifted
at different values. The reconstruction quality of MPRD L-SPECT with and
without center shifting is evaluated in terms of the Full Width at Half Maximum
(FWHM) and Modulation Transfer Function (MTF). Moreover, the visual comparison
is also examined. The results indicate that center shifting of MPRD L-SPECT
overcomes the problem of the central artefact with improved FWHM. By increasing
MPRD's scanning center shift gap, the spatial resolution can be further
improved.

distributed energy resources (DERs) in power systems. The approach is based on
the fact that most planning studies utilize some form of optimization, and
solutions to these optimization problems provide insights into the sensitivity
of many system variables to operating conditions and constraints. However, most
of the existing sensitivity-based planning criteria do not capture ranges of
effectiveness of these solutions (i.e., ranges of the effectiveness of Lagrange
multipliers). The proposed method detects the ranges of the effectiveness of
Lagrange multipliers and uses them to determine optimal solution alternatives.
Profiles for existing generation and loads, and transmission constraints are
taken into consideration. The proposed method is used to determine the impacts
of DERs at different locations, in the presence of a stochastic element (load
variability). This method consists of sequentially calculating Lagrange
multipliers of the dual solution of the optimization problem for various load
buses for all load scenarios. Optimal sizes and sites of resources are jointly
determined in a sequential manner based on the validity of active constraints.
The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through several case
studies on various test systems including the IEEE reliability test system
(IEEE RTS), the IEEE 14, and 30 bus systems. In comparison with conventional
sensitivity-based approaches (i.e., without considering ranges of validity of
Lagrange multipliers), the proposed approach provides more accurate results for
active constraints.

M51 and the edge-on galaxy NGC 891. For M51, the polarization vectors generally
follow the spiral pattern defined by the molecular gas distribution, the
far-infrared (FIR) intensity contours, and other tracers of star formation. The
fractional polarization is much lower in the FIR-bright central regions than in
the outer regions, and we rule out loss of grain alignment and variations in
magnetic field strength as causes. When compared with existing synchrotron
observations, which sample different regions with different weighting, we find
the net position angles are strongly correlated, the fractional polarizations
are moderately correlated, but the polarized intensities are uncorrelated. We
argue that the low fractional polarization in the central regions must be due
to significant numbers of highly turbulent segments across the beam and along
lines of sight in the beam in the central 3 kpc of M51. For NGC 891, the FIR
polarization vectors within an intensity contour of 1500 $\rm{MJy~sr^{-1}}$ are
oriented very close to the plane of the galaxy. The FIR polarimetry is probably
sampling the magnetic field geometry in NGC 891 much deeper into the disk than
is possible with NIR polarimetry and radio synchrotron measurements. In some
locations in NGC 891 the FIR polarization is very low, suggesting we are
preferentially viewing the magnetic field mostly along the line of sight, down
the length of embedded spiral arms. There is tentative evidence for a vertical
field in the polarized emission off the plane of the disk.

(BP) measurement. But, it requires more than one cardiovascular signals
involving more than one sensing device. In this paper, we propose a method for
continuous cuffless blood pressure measurement with the help of left
ventricular ejection time (LVET). The LVET is estimated using a signal obtained
through a micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)-based accelerometric sensor.
The sensor acquires a seismocardiogram (SCG) signal at the chest surface, and
the LVET information is extracted. Both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are estimated by calibrating the system with the
original arterial blood pressure values of the subjects. The proposed method is
evaluated using different quantitative measures on the signals collected from
ten subjects under the supine position. The performance of the proposed method
is also compared with two earlier approaches, where PTT intervals are estimated
from electrocardiogram (ECG)-photoplethysmogram (PPG) and SCG-PPG,
respectively. The performance results clearly show that the proposed method is
comparable with the state-of-the-art methods. Also, the computed blood pressure
is compared with the original one, measured through a CNAP system. It gives the
mean errors of the estimated systolic BP and diastolic BP within the range of
-0.19 +/- 3.3 mmHg and -1.29 +/- 2.6 mmHg, respectively. The mean absolute
errors for systolic BP and diastolic BP are 3.2 mmHg and 2.6 mmHg,
respectively. The accuracy of BPs estimated from the proposed method satisfies
the requirements of the IEEE standard of 5 +/- 8 mmHg deviation, and thus, it
may be used for ubiquitous long term blood pressure monitoring.

Therefore, optimal reconfiguration is an important factor in the operation of
distribution systems to minimize active power losses. Smart and automated
electric distribution systems are able to reconfigure as a response to changes
in load levels to minimize active power losses. The proposed method searches
spanning trees of potential configurations and finds the optimal spanning tree
using a genetic algorithm in two steps. In the first step, all invalid
combinations of branches and tie-lines (i.e., switching combinations that do
not provide power to some of loads or violate the radiality and connectivity
conditions) generated by initial population of GA are filtered out with the
help of spanning-tree search algorithm. In the second step, power flow analyses
are performed only for combinations that form spanning trees. The optimal
configuration is then determined based on the amount of active power losses
(optimal configuration is the one that results in minimum power losses). The
proposed method is implemented on several systems including the well-known
33-node and 69-node systems. The results show that the proposed method is

it collectively migrates across surfaces using grappling-hook like pili. We
show that the fast moving cells of a hyperpilated mutant are overtaken and
outcompeted by the slower moving wild-type at high cell densities. Using theory
developed to study liquid crystals, we demonstrate that this effect is mediated
by the physics of topological defects, points where cells with different
orientations meet one another. Our analyses reveal that when comet-like defects
collide with one another, the fast-moving mutant cells rotate vertically and
become trapped. By moving more slowly, wild-type cells avoid this trapping
mechanism, allowing them to collectively migrate faster. Our work suggests that
the physics of liquid crystals has played a pivotal role in the evolution of
collective bacterial motility by exerting a strong selection for cells that

multidimensional harmonic oscillator systems with Nose-Hoover type thermostat
are given. The origin of the nonergodicity is symmetries in the
multidimensional target physical system, and is differ from that in the
Nose-Hoover thermostat with the 1-dimensional harmonic oscillator. A new simple
deterministic method to recover the ergodicity is also presented. An individual
thermostat variable is attached to each degree of freedom, and all these
variables act on a friction coefficient for each degree of freedom. This action
is linear and controlled by a Nos\'e mass matrix Q, which is a matrix analogue
of the scalar Nos\'e's mass. Matrix Q can break the symmetry and contribute to
attain the ergodicity.

  Computation",,,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cloud radio-access networks (C-RAN) have been proposed as an enabling
technology for keeping up with the requirements of next-generation wireless
networks. Most existing works on C-RAN consider the uplink or the downlink
separately. However, designing the uplink and the downlink jointly may bring
additional advantage, especially if message source-destination information is
taken into account. In this paper, this idea is demonstrated by considering
pairwise message exchange between users in a C-RAN. A multi-pair two-way
transmission scheme is proposed which targets maximizing the end-to-end user
data rates. In the proposed scheme, a lattice-based computation strategy is
used, where the baseband processing unit (BBU) pool decodes integer linear
combinations of paired users' codewords instead of decoding linear combinations
of individual codewords. The BBU pool then compresses the computed signals and
forwards them to the remote radio heads (RRHs), which decompress the signals
and send them to the users. Finally, each user decodes its desired message
using its own message as side information. The achievable rate of this scheme
is derived, optimized, and evaluated numerically. Results reveal that
significant end-to-end rate improvement can be achieved using the proposed
scheme compared to existing schemes.

used to infer the properties of the emitting circumstellar dust in
protoplanetary and debris discs. Most notably, dust size distributions and
details of the collision physics are derived from SED slopes at long
wavelengths. This paper reviews the approximations that are commonly used and
contrasts them with numerical results for the thermal emission. The inferred
size distribution indexes are shown to be greater and more sensitive to the
observed sub(mm) spectral indexes than previously considered. This effect
results from aspects of the transition from small grains with volumetric
absorption to bigger grains that absorb and emit near to their surface,
controlled by both the real and the imaginary part of the refractive index. The
steeper size distributions indicate stronger size-dependence of material
strengths or impact velocities or, otherwise, less efficient transport or
erosion processes. Strong uncertainties remain because of insufficient
knowledge of the material composition, porosity, and optical properties at long
wavelengths.

planets is in part limited by the extreme sensitivity of the instrumental
response to tiny optical path differences between apertures. The recently
proposed kernel-nuller architecture attempts to alleviate this effect with an
all-in-one combiner design that enables the production of observables
inherently robust to residual optical path differences (<< lambda). Until now,
a unique kernel nuller design has been proposed ad hoc for a four-beam
combiner. We examine the properties of this original design and generalize them
for an arbitrary number of apertures. We introduce a convenient graphical
representation of the complex combiner matrices that model the kernel nuller
and highlight the symmetry properties that enable the formation of kernel
nulls. The analytical description of the nulled outputs we provide demonstrates
the properties of a kernel nuller. Our description helps outline a systematic
way to build a kernel nuller for an arbitrary number of apertures. The designs
for 3- and 6-input combiners are presented along with the original 4-input
concept. Combiners grow in complexity with the square of the number of
apertures. While one can mitigate this complexity by multiplexing nullers
working independently over a smaller number of sub-apertures, an all-in-one
kernel nuller recombining a large number of apertures appears as the most
efficient way to characterize a high-contrast complex astrophysical scene. One
can design kernel nullers for an arbitrary number of apertures that produce
observable quantities robust to residual perturbations. The designs we
recommend are lossless and take full advantage of all the available
interferometric baselines. They are complete, result in as many kernel nulls as
the theoretically expected number of closure-phases, and are optimized to
require as few outputs as possible.

performed to check the consistency of our data with the three-flavor model. Our

times, generally focusing on new models which optimise one of many disparate
disentanglement metrics. Symmetry Based Disentangled Representation learning
introduced a robust mathematical framework that defined precisely what is meant
by a ""linear disentangled representation"". This framework determined that such
representations would depend on a particular decomposition of the symmetry
group acting on the data, showing that actions would manifest through
irreducible group representations acting on independent representational
subspaces. Caselles-Dupre et al [2019] subsequently proposed the first model to
induce and demonstrate a linear disentangled representation in a VAE model. In
this work we empirically show that linear disentangled representations are not
generally present in standard VAE models and that they instead require altering
the loss landscape to induce them. We proceed to show that such representations
are a desirable property with regard to classical disentanglement metrics.
Finally we propose a method to induce irreducible representations which forgoes
the need for labelled action sequences, as was required by prior work. We
explore a number of properties of this method, including the ability to learn
from action sequences without knowledge of intermediate states and robustness
under visual noise. We also demonstrate that it can successfully learn 4
independent symmetries directly from pixels.

ambiguity and self-occlusion in a single view prohibit the recovery of as
high-quality motion as multi-view reconstruction. While multi-view videos are
not common, the videos of a celebrity performing a specific action are usually
abundant on the Internet. Even if these videos were recorded at different time
instances, they would encode the same motion characteristics of the person.
Therefore, we propose to capture human motion by jointly analyzing these
Internet videos instead of using single videos separately. However, this new
task poses many new challenges that cannot be addressed by existing methods, as
the videos are unsynchronized, the camera viewpoints are unknown, the
background scenes are different, and the human motions are not exactly the same
among videos. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
optimization-based framework and experimentally demonstrate its ability to
recover much more precise and detailed motion from multiple videos, compared
against monocular motion capture methods.

complicated algorithms to improve the time-of-arrival (TOA) estimation
accuracy. However, in this letter, we propose to generate fine-grained features
from the full band and resource block (RB) based reference signals, and
calculate the cross-correlations accordingly to improve the observation
resolution as well as the TOA estimation results. Using the spectrogram-like
cross-correlation feature map, we apply the machine learning technology with
decoupled feature extraction and fitting to understand the variations in the
time and frequency domains and project the features directly into TOA results.
Through numerical examples, we show that the proposed high accurate TOA
estimation with fine-grained feature generation can achieve at least 51% root
mean square error (RMSE) improvement in the static propagation environments and
38 ns median TOA estimation errors for multipath fading environments, which is
equivalently 36% and 25% improvement if compared with the existing MUSIC and
ESPRIT algorithms, respectively.

new task called video description via two multi-modal cooperative dialog
agents, whose ultimate goal is for one conversational agent to describe an
unseen video based on the dialog and two static frames. Specifically, one of
the intelligent agents - Q-BOT - is given two static frames from the beginning

relevant natural language questions before describing the unseen video. A-BOT,
the other agent who has already seen the entire video, assists Q-BOT to
accomplish the goal by providing answers to those questions. We propose a
QA-Cooperative Network with a dynamic dialog history update learning mechanism
to transfer knowledge from A-BOT to Q-BOT, thus helping Q-BOT to better
describe the video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-BOT can
effectively learn to describe an unseen video by the proposed model and the
cooperative learning method, achieving the promising performance where Q-BOT is
given the full ground truth history dialog.

In the same context but in odd-dimensions, the present authors previously
derived a conformally invariant averaged null energy condition (CANEC), which
is a version of the ANEC with a certain weight function for conformal
invariance. In even-dimensions, however, one has to deal with gravitational
conformal anomalies, which make relevant formulas much more complicated than
the odd-dimensional case. In two-dimensions, we derive the ANEC by applying the
no-bulk-shortcut principle. In four-dimensions, we derive an inequality which
essentially provides the lower-bound for the ANEC with a weight function. For
this purpose, and also to get some geometric insights into gravitational
conformal anomalies, we express the stress-energy formulas in terms of
geometric quantities such as the expansions of boundary null geodesics and a
quasi-local mass of the boundary geometry. We argue when the lowest bound is
achieved and also discuss when the averaged value of the null energy can be
negative, considering a simple example of a spatially compact universe with
wormhole throat.

performance on graphs with 25 to 175 nodes with varying density. We collected
performance measures (accuracy and response time), subjective feedback, and

participants had given up. We also explored the effects of global network
layout features such as size or number of crossings, and features of the

(i.e. an intensity modulation of a few percent) on timescales of a few days or
longer are commonly seen at centimetre wavelengths and are thought to result
from the line-of-sight integrated turbulence in the interstellar plasma of the
Milky Way. So far, only three sources were known that show more extreme
variations, with modulations at the level of some dozen percent on timescales
shorter than an hour. This requires propagation through nearby (d <~10 pc)

with Apertif of a source (J1402+5347) showing extreme (~50%) and rapid
variations on a timescale of just 6.5 minutes in the decimetre band (1.4 GHz).
The spatial scintillation pattern is highly anisotropic, with a semi-minor axis
of about 20,000 km. The canonical theory of refractive scintillation constrains
the scattering plasma to be within the Oort cloud. The sightline to J1402+5347,
however, passes unusually close to the B3 star Alkaid (eta UMa) at a distance
of 32 pc. If the scintillations are associated with Alkaid, then the angular

the recommendation task due to their ability to model non-linear item
relationships effectively. However, existing autoencoder recommenders use
fully-connected neural network layers and do not employ structure learning.
This can lead to inefficient training, especially when the data is sparse as
commonly found in collaborative filtering. The aforementioned results in lower
generalization ability and reduced performance. In this paper, we introduce
structure learning for autoencoder recommenders by taking advantage of the
inherent item groups present in the collaborative filtering domain. Due to the
nature of items in general, we know that certain items are more related to each
other than to other items. Based on this, we propose a method that first learns
groups of related items and then uses this information to determine the
connectivity structure of an auto-encoding neural network. This results in a
network that is sparsely connected. This sparse structure can be viewed as a
prior that guides the network training. Empirically we demonstrate that the
proposed structure learning enables the autoencoder to converge to a local
optimum with a much smaller spectral norm and generalization error bound than
the fully-connected network. The resultant sparse network considerably
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods like \textsc{Mult-vae/Mult-dae} on
multiple benchmarked datasets even when the same number of parameters and flops
are used. It also has a better cold-start performance.

with a small number of annotated samples by exploiting transferable knowledge
from training data (base categories). Most current studies assume that the
transferable knowledge can be well used to identify novel categories. However,
such transferable capability may be impacted by the dataset bias, and this
problem has rarely been investigated before. Besides, most of few-shot learning
methods are biased to different datasets, which is also an important issue that
needs to be investigated deeply. In this paper, we first investigate the impact
of transferable capabilities learned from base categories. Specifically, we use
the relevance to measure relationships between base categories and novel
categories. Distributions of base categories are depicted via the instance
density and category diversity. The FSIR model learns better transferable
knowledge from relevant training data. In the relevant data, dense instances or
diverse categories can further enrich the learned knowledge. Experimental
results on different sub-datasets of ImagNet demonstrate category relevance,
instance density and category diversity can depict transferable bias from base
categories. Second, we investigate performance differences on different
datasets from dataset structures and different few-shot learning methods.
Specifically, we introduce image complexity, intra-concept visual consistency,
and inter-concept visual similarity to quantify characteristics of dataset
structures. We use these quantitative characteristics and four few-shot
learning methods to analyze performance differences on five different datasets.
Based on the experimental analysis, some insightful observations are obtained
from the perspective of both dataset structures and few-shot learning methods.
We hope these observations are useful to guide future FSIR research.

requires public access structures, which violates privacy and facilitates the
adversary by revealing high-value targets. In this paper, we address this
shortcoming by introducing \emph{hidden access structures}, which remain secret
until some authorized subset of parties collaborate. The central piece of this
work is the construction of a set-system $\mathcal{H}$ with strictly greater
than $\exp\left(c \dfrac{1.5 (\log h)^2}{\log \log h}\right)$ subsets of a set
of $h$ elements. Our set-system $\mathcal{H}$ is defined over $\mathbb{Z}_m$,
where $m$ is a non-prime-power, such that the size of each set in $\mathcal{H}$
is divisible by $m$ but the sizes of their pairwise intersections are not
divisible by $m$, unless one set is a subset of another. We derive a vector
family $\mathcal{V}$ from $\mathcal{H}$ such that superset-subset relationships
in $\mathcal{H}$ are represented by inner products in $\mathcal{V}$. We use
$\mathcal{V}$ to ""encode"" the access structures and thereby develop the first
\emph{access structure hiding} secret sharing scheme. For a setting with $\ell$
parties, our scheme supports $2^{\binom{\ell}{\ell/2+1}}$ out of the
$2^{2^{\ell - O(\log \ell)}}$ total monotone access structures, and its maximum
share size for any access structures is $(1+ o(1)) \dfrac{2^{\ell+1}}{\sqrt{\pi
\ell/2}}$. The scheme assumes semi-honest polynomial-time parties, and its
security relies on the Generalized Diffie-Hellman assumption.

be guaranteed for the intermediate activations inside the network. A widely
used method to enforce this property inside the network is batch normalization.
It was developed to combat covariate shift inside networks. Empirically it is

problems for classical approaches such as planning minimum-time trajectories
under uncertain dynamics and controlling the car at the limits of its handling.
Besides, the requirement of minimizing the lap time, which is a sparse
objective, and the difficulty of collecting training data from human experts
have also hindered researchers from directly applying learning-based approaches
to solve the problem. In the present work, we propose a learning-based system
for autonomous car racing by leveraging a high-fidelity physical car
simulation, a course-progress proxy reward, and deep reinforcement learning. We
deploy our system in Gran Turismo Sport, a world-leading car simulator known
for its realistic physics simulation of different race cars and tracks, which
is even used to recruit human race car drivers. Our trained policy achieves
autonomous racing performance that goes beyond what had been achieved so far by
the built-in AI, and, at the same time, outperforms the fastest driver in a
dataset of over 50,000 human players.

a low-rank part and a sparse part. There are mainly two types of algorithms for
RPCA. The first type of algorithm applies regularization terms on the singular
values of a matrix to obtain a low-rank matrix. However, calculating singular
values can be very expensive for large matrices. The second type of algorithm
replaces the low-rank matrix as the multiplication of two small matrices. They
are faster than the first type because no singular value decomposition (SVD) is
required. However, the rank of the low-rank matrix is required, and an accurate
rank estimation is needed to obtain a reasonable solution. In this paper, we
propose algorithms that combine both types. Our proposed algorithms require an
upper bound of the rank and SVD on small matrices. First, they are faster than
the first type because the cost of SVD on small matrices is negligible. Second,
they are more robust than the second type because an upper bound of the rank
instead of the exact rank is required. Furthermore, we apply the Gauss-Newton
method to increase the speed of our algorithms. Numerical experiments show the
better performance of our proposed algorithms.

dependent on the choice of step size (or learning rate) which often requires
non-trivial amount of tuning. In this paper, we introduce a stochastic variant
of classic backtracking line search algorithm that satisfies R\'enyi
differential privacy. Specifically, the proposed algorithm adaptively chooses
the step size satsisfying the the Armijo condition (with high probability)
using noisy gradients and function estimates. Furthermore, to improve the
probability with which the chosen step size satisfies the condition, it adjusts
per-iteration privacy budget during runtime according to the reliability of
noisy gradient. A naive implementation of the backtracking search algorithm may
end up using unacceptably large privacy budget as the ability of adaptive step
size selection comes at the cost of extra function evaluations. The proposed
algorithm avoids this problem by using the sparse vector technique combined
with the recent privacy amplification lemma. We also introduce a privacy budget
adaptation strategy in which the algorithm adaptively increases the budget when
it detects that directions pointed by consecutive gradients are drastically
different. Extensive experiments on both convex and non-convex problems show
that the adaptively chosen step sizes allow the proposed algorithm to
efficiently use the privacy budget and show competitive performance against
existing private optimizers.

harvesting phenomenon for circularly accelerated detectors locally interacting
with massless scalar fields. The dependence of the transition probability on
the parameters associated with the circular motion is first analyzed in detail.
By a cross-comparison with the situation of the uniformly accelerated motion,
we obtain that the transition probability and the possible thermalization
behavior for detectors rotating with an extremely large circular radius are
analogous to that for uniformly accelerated detectors, but for a very small
linear speed and a large acceleration, the effective temperature which
characterizes the detectors' thermalization in a finite duration is much lower
than that for uniformly accelerated detectors. We then focus on the phenomenon
of entanglement harvesting in two special situations of circular trajectories,
i.e., the coaxial rotation and the mutually perpendicular axial rotation by
examining the concurrence as the entanglement measure in detail. We find that
when two circularly accelerated detectors have equivalent acceleration and size
of circular trajectory, the harvested entanglement rapidly decays with
increasing acceleration or separation between two detectors. In contrast with
the situation of uniform acceleration, the angular velocity would have
significant impacts on entanglement harvesting. Especially for those detectors
circularly moving in different directions, both the acceleration and trajectory
radius play an important inhibiting role in entanglement harvesting. When two
circularly accelerated detectors have different values of acceleration or
angular velocity, we find that the entanglement can still be extracted by such
detectors, even in the situation that one detector is at rest and the other is
in a circular motion.

state channels (FSCs) with memory using reinforcement learning (RL). The
feedback capacity was previously estimated using its formulation as a Markov
decision process (MDP) with dynamic programming (DP) algorithms. However, their
computational complexity grows exponentially with the channel alphabet size.
Therefore, we use RL, and specifically its ability to parameterize value
functions and policies with neural networks, to evaluate numerically the
feedback capacity of channels with a large alphabet size. The outcome of the RL
algorithm is a numerical lower bound on the feedback capacity, which is used to
reveal the structure of the optimal solution. The structure is modeled by a
graph-based auxiliary random variable that is utilized to derive an analytic
upper bound on the feedback capacity with the duality bound. The capacity
computation is concluded by verifying the tightness of the upper bound by
testing whether it is BCJR invariant. We demonstrate this method on the Ising
channel with an arbitrary alphabet size. For an alphabet size smaller than or
equal to 8, we derive the analytic solution of the capacity. Next, the
structure of the numerical solution is used to deduce a simple coding scheme
that achieves the feedback capacity and serves as a lower bound for larger
alphabets. For an alphabet size greater than 8, we present an upper bound on
the feedback capacity. For an asymptotically large alphabet size, we present an
asymptotic optimal coding scheme.

construction using active load-bearing elements integrated into the structure.
Such adaptive structures are of high complexity and very heterogeneous in
nature. Port-Hamiltonian systems theory provides a promising approach for their
modeling and control. Subsystem dynamics can be formulated in a
domain-independent way and interconnected by means of power flows. The modular
approach is also suitable for robust decentralized control schemes. Starting
from a distributed-parameter port-Hamiltonian formulation of beam dynamics, we
show the application of an existing structure-preserving mixed finite element
method to arrive at finite-dimensional approximations. In contrast to the
modeling of single bodies with a single boundary, we consider complex
structures composed of many simple elements interconnected at the boundary.
This is analogous to the usual way of modeling civil engineering structures
which has not been transferred to port-Hamiltonian systems before. A block
diagram representation of the interconnected systems is used to generate
coupling constraints which leads to differential algebraic equations of index
one. After the elimination of algebraic constraints, systems in
input-state-output(ISO) port-Hamiltonian form are obtained. Port-Hamiltonian
system models for the considered class of systems can also be constructed from
the mass and stiffness matrices obtained via conventional finite element
methods. We show how this relates to the presented approach and discuss the
differences, promoting a better understanding across engineering disciplines.

unknown to the system operator may occur. Therefore, presentation attack
detection (PAD) methods are used to determine whether samples stem from a bona

most works are dedicated to solve PAD as a two-class classification problem,
which includes training a model on both bona fide and PA samples. In spite of

detecting PAIs from unknown materials. To address this issue, we propose a new

for establishing such techniques in practice. With the use of deep neural

the cause of a prediction to identify intervention mechanisms that might affect
the decision making to secure process performance. In this paper, we propose
XNAP, the first explainable, DNN-based PBPM technique for the next activity

  At this transition an 'island' forms, which is in a significantly different

graph-mining tasks. In this work, we formally establish that two recurring
characteristics of real-world graphs, namely heavy-tailed degree distributions
and large clustering coefficients, imply the existence of substantially large
vertex neighborhoods with high edge-density. This observation suggests a very
simple approach for extracting large quasi-cliques: simply scan the vertex
neighborhoods, compute the clustering coefficient of each vertex, and output
the best such subgraph. The implementation of such a method requires counting
the triangles in a graph, which is a well-studied problem in graph mining. When
empirically tested across a number of real-world graphs, this approach reveals
a surprise: vertex neighborhoods include maximal cliques of non-trivial sizes,
and the density of the best neighborhood often compares favorably to subgraphs
produced by dedicated algorithms for maximizing subgraph density. For graphs
with small clustering coefficients, we demonstrate that small vertex
neighborhoods can be refined using a local-search method to ``grow'' larger
cliques and near-cliques. Our results indicate that contrary to worst-case
theoretical results, mining cliques and quasi-cliques of non-trivial sizes from
real-world graphs is often not a difficult problem, and provides motivation for
further work geared towards a better explanation of these empirical successes.

are used in the construction of functional spaces, in the natural
generalization of the Schr\""odinger equation in quantum theory, in the
construction of the models of acoustic wave propagation in complex media (for
example, biological tissues) and space-time models of anomalous (very slow or
very fast) diffusion, in spectral theory etc. If we assume the radiality of the
function on which the Laplace operator acts, then we receive the problem of
constructing the fractional power of the Bessel operator. We propose to use a
compositional method for constructing the operators mentioned earlier, which
leads to constructions similar in their properties to the Riesz derivatives.
The Hankel transform is considered as a basic integral transformation. On its
basis, the compositional method proposed by V.V. Katrakhov and S.M. Sitnik,
negative powers of the Bessel operator are constructed. The resulting operator
contains the Gaussian hypergeometric function in the kernel. For further study,
the generalized translation operator is considered in the article, and its
properties are proved. For constructing a positive fractional power of the

Monte-Carlo and density functional theory molecular dynamics, we derive the
equation of state of magnesium in the regime of warm dense matter, with
densities ranging from 0.43 to 86.11~g/cm$^3$~and temperatures from 20,000 K to
$5\times10^8$~K. These conditions are relevant for the interiors of giant
planets and stars as well as for shock compression measurements and inertial
confinement fusion experiments. We study ionization mechanisms and electronic
structure of magnesium as a function of density and temperature. We show that
the L shell electrons 2s and 2p energy bands merge at high density. This
results into a gradual ionization of the L-shell with increasing density and
temperature. In this regard, Mg differs from MgO, which is also reflected in
the shape of its principal shock Hugoniot curve. For Mg, we predict a single
broad pressure-temperature region where the shock compression ratio is
approximately 4.9. Mg thus differs from Si and Al plasma that exhibit two
well-separated compression maxima on the Hugoniot curve for L and K shell
ionizations. Finally we study multiple shocks and effects of preheat and
precompression.

can be used to improve performance by allowing longer time-step intervals. The
continuous equations are Galilean invariant, however, standard
finite-difference-based discretizations are not discretely invariant with the
error being proportional to the product of the local translation velocity and
the truncation error. Even though such numerical errors are expected to be
small, it is shown that in LES of buoyant convection the turbulent large-scale
flow organization can modulate and amplify the error. Galilean invariance of
global flow statistics is observed in well-resolved direct numerical
simulations (DNS). In LES of single-phase convection under an inversion, flow
statistics are nearly Galilean invariant and do not depend on the order of
accuracy of the finite difference approximation. In contrast, in LES of cloudy
convection, flow statistics show strong dependence on the frame of reference
and the order of approximation. The error with respect to the frame of
reference becomes negligible as the order of accuracy is increased from second
to sixth in the present LES. Schemes with low resolving power can produce large
dispersion errors in the surface-fixed frame that can be amplified by
large-scale flow anisotropies, such as strong updrafts rising in a
non-turbulent free troposphere in cumulus-cloud layers. Interestingly, in the
present large-eddy simulations, a second-order discretization in the proper
Galilean frame can yield comparable accuracy as a high-order scheme in the
surface-fixed frame.

dynamic instability of a thin film, leading to its destruction. The
calculations are performed for a thin (5 atomic layers) $fcc$ aluminum film
using the interatomic interaction potential tested by comparing the numerical
results with the analytical ones obtained in the framework of elasticity
theory. For this purpose, an original approach is developed, which allows one
to calculate the dispersion law of long-wave phonons in ultrathin films using
the molecular dynamics method. The temperatures ($< 600 K$) at which the system
remains stable over a time interval of $0.6 ns$ are found. This makes it
possible to analyze the low-frequency part of the spectrum down to the minimum
frequency $\nu_{min}=0.0166 THz$ (at $T = 50 K$), and to determine the
vibration frequency of the longest, for this problem geometry, bending wave
$\nu_{0}=0.033 THz$ which decreases with increasing temperature, hence, its
period grows. Once the vibration period of this mode becomes comparable with
the time of simulation, there occurs, during calculation, a continuous increase
in the amplitude of this mode which will be referred to as ""retarded mode"". It
is shown that the film destruction begins with the attainment of a certain
critical value of the bending wave amplitude.

speculation that the standard model gauge group might arise through an
analogous breaking of a yet more unified group. Such `grand unified theories'
have the advantage of unifying both the gauge structure and fermion
representations of the standard model. Unfortunately, the theories that most
elegantly unify the fermions, without predicting extra unobserved fermion
states, do not explain the existence of the three fermion generations. They
also typically predict a proliferation of bosonic states, which lead to so-far
unobserved processes like proton decay. In this paper we introduce an
alternative explanation for why one might only observe a subgroup of a larger
`unified' group in nature. The approach we introduce gives rise naturally to a
generation structure without the appearance of unwanted fermion states, and is
cleaner in the sense that it avoids the usual proliferation of unobserved
bosonic states and resulting unobserved processes.
