observed in numerous quantum systems. Although it arises in the 'strong

the Mollow triplet structure due to strong driving. In experiments, we explore
the regime beyond the rotating wave approximation using concatenated continuous
driving that has less stringent requirements on the driving field power. We are
then able to reveal additional transition frequencies, shifts in energy levels,
and corrections to the transition amplitudes. In particular, we find that these
amplitudes are more sensitive to high-order effects than the frequency shifts,
and that they still require an accurate determination in order to achieve
high-fidelity quantum control. The experimental results are validated by the
Floquet theory, which enables the precise numerical simulation of the evolution
and further provides an analytical form for an effective Hamiltonian that
approximately predicts the spin dynamics beyond the rotating wave

task. In contrast to the most existing pair-wised temporal link annotation,
Reimers et al.(2016) proposed to annotate the time anchor (a.k.a. the exact

representations of Single-Day/Multi-Day and Certain/Uncertain. This increases
the complexity of modeling the temporal relations between two time anchors,
which cannot be categorized into the relations of Allen's interval algebra

  In this paper, we propose an effective method to decompose such complex
temporal relations into sub-level relations by introducing a unified quadruple

anchors. The temporal relation classifiers are trained in a multi-label
classification manner. The system structure of our approach is much simpler

the expected signals (the full time trace, not just the peak amplitude) at any
point around the shower core, given a set of signals simulated in a finite
number of antennas strategically located in a pattern that exploits the
signature features of the radio wavefront. The method can be applied
indistinctly to the electric field or to the antenna response to the electric
field, in the three polarization directions. The synthesized signal can be used
to evaluate trigger conditions, compute the fluence or reconstruct the shower
incoming direction, allowing for the production of one single library of
simulations that can be used and re-used for the characterization and
optimization of radio arrays and their associated reconstruction methods, for a

Special attention is directed to the possible presence of $\Delta(1232)$
baryons in neutron star matter. Our results indicate that this particle could
make up a large fraction of the baryons in neutron stars and thus have a
significant effect on the properties of such objects, particularly on their
radii. This is partially caused by the low density appearance of $\Delta$s for
a wide range of theoretically defensible sets of meson-hyperon, SU(3) ESC08
model, and meson-$\Delta$ coupling constants. The transition of hadronic matter
to quark matter, treated in the 2SC+s condensation phase, is found to occur
only in neutron stars very close to the mass peak. Nevertheless, quark matter
may still constitute an appreciable fraction of the stars' total matter if the
phase transition is treated as Maxwell-like (sharp), in which case the neutron
stars located beyond the gravitational mass peak would remain stable against
gravitational collapse. In this case, the instability against gravitational
collapse is shifted to a new (terminal) mass different from the maximum-mass of
the stellar sequence, giving rise to stable compact objects with the same
gravitational masses as those of the neutron stars on the traditional branch,
but whose radii are smaller by up to 1 km. All models for the equation of state

for hate speech detection based on an existing pre-trained language model

regularization method to reweight input samples, thereby decreasing the effects
of high correlated training set' s n-grams with class labels, and then
fine-tune our pre-trained BERT-based model with the new re-weighted samples. To
evaluate our bias alleviation mechanism, we employ a cross-domain approach in
which we use the trained classifiers on the aforementioned datasets to predict
the labels of two new datasets from Twitter, AAE-aligned and White-aligned
groups, which indicate tweets written in African-American English (AAE) and
Standard American English (SAE) respectively. The results show the existence of
systematic racial bias in trained classifiers as they tend to assign tweets

This framework is problem- and model-agnostic and can be used to estimate a
broad variety of target parameters of interest in applied statistics: we can
consider any target function for which an IF of a population-averaged version
exists in analytic form. Throughout, we put particular focus on so-called
coarsening at random/doubly robust problems with partially unobserved

inference in the presence of missing outcome data. Within this framework, we
propose two general learning algorithms that build on the idea of nonparametric
plug-in bias removal via IFs: the 'IF-learner' which uses pseudo-outcomes
motivated by uncentered IFs for regression in large samples and outputs entire
target functions without confidence bands, and the 'Group-IF-learner', which
outputs only approximations to a function but can give confidence estimates if
sufficient information on coarsening mechanisms is available. We apply both in
a simulation study on inferring treatment effects.

the clarification of the role of gasdynamics, a simple Arrhenius kinetic law is

temperature, is kept constant to obtain the same reaction rate sensitivity to
temperature in all considered mixtures. This procedure dissociates the
gasdynamic effects from the chemistry effects. The numerical results reveal
that in mixtures with low polytropic indicies, the convective mixing is
enhanced compared to mixtures with higher polytropic indicies. The mixing is
evaluated using Lagrangian tracers. Moreover, mixtures with low polytropic
indicies are found to have a shorter reaction length than mixtures with high
polytropic indicies. Also, for the range of parameters considered in this study
the results indicate that Mach stem bifurcation in detonations due to jetting

systems, such as quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs), are still a matter of
debate, insight into the radiative components responsible for such behaviour
can be obtained by studying their energy dependent temporal behaviour. In
particular, one needs to ascertain which variations of the parameters of the
best fit time-averaged spectral components reproduce the observed energy
dependent fractional r.m.s and time-lags. However, to obtain meaningful
interpretation, the standard spectral component parameters have to be recast to
physically relevant ones. Then, the energy dependent temporal variations that
their fluctuations will cause, needs to be predicted and compared with
observations. In this work, we describe a generic method to do this and apply
the technique to the ~ 3-4 Hz QPOs observed in the black hole system GRS
1915+105 as observed by AstroSat where the time-averaged spectra can be
represented by emission from a truncated disk and a hot thermal Comptonizing
coronae in the inner regions. We find that the QPOs and their harmonic can be
explained in terms of correlated local accretion rate variations in the disk,
the truncated disk radius, the optical depth and the heating rate of the
coronae with time-delays between them. We highlight the potential of such
techniques to unravel the radiative process responsible for variability using
high quality spectral and temporal data from AstroSat and NICER.

and target subsets according to the desired consolidation criteria (e.g.,
generating sharp points or points in sparse regions). The network learns a
mapping from source to target subsets, and implicitly learns to consolidate the
point cloud. During inference, the network is fed with random subsets of points
from the input, which it displaces to synthesize a consolidated point set. We
leverage the inductive bias of neural networks to eliminate noise and outliers,
a notoriously difficult problem in point cloud consolidation. The shared
weights of the network are optimized over the entire shape, learning non-local
statistics and exploiting the recurrence of local-scale geometries.
Specifically, the network encodes the distribution of the underlying shape
surface within a fixed set of local kernels, which results in the best
explanation of the underlying shape surface. We demonstrate the ability to

  analysis of engagement with a mobile intervention",,,,,"stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimation of local average treatment effects in randomized trials typically
requires an assumption known as the exclusion restriction in cases where we are
unwilling to rule out unmeasured confounding. Under this assumption, any
benefit from treatment would be mediated through the post-randomization
variable being conditioned upon, and would be directly attributable to neither
the randomization itself nor its latent descendants. Recently, there has been
interest in mobile health interventions to provide healthcare support; such
studies can feature one-way content and/or two-way content, the latter of which
allowing subjects to engage with the intervention in a way that can be
objectively measured on a subject-specific level (e.g., proportion of text
messages receiving a response). It is hence highly likely that a benefit
achieved by the intervention could be explained in part by receipt of the
intervention content and in part by engaging with/responding to it. When
seeking to characterize average causal effects conditional on
post-randomization engagement, the exclusion restriction is therefore all but
surely violated. In this paper, we propose a conceptually intuitive sensitivity
analysis procedure for this setting that gives rise to sharp bounds on local
average treatment effects. A wide array of simulation studies reveal this
approach to have very good finite-sample behavior and to recover local average
treatment effects under correct specification of the sensitivity parameter. We

and assumed that the network learns like a human by connecting feature maps
from deep layers to shallow layers. We propose some Feedback Attentions which
imitate human brain and feeds back the feature maps of output layer to close
layer to the input. U-Net with Feedback Attention showed better result than the
conventional methods using only feedforward processing.

specification of the model, including the link function, the predictors, and
unknown parameters, such as the regression coefficients. To deal with
uncertainties of these model specifications, it is important to construct
optimal designs with high efficiency under such uncertainties. Existing methods
such as Bayesian experimental designs often use prior distributions of model
specifications to incorporate model uncertainties into the design criterion.
Alternatively, one can obtain the design by optimizing the worst-case design
efficiency with respect to uncertainties of model specifications. In this work,
we propose a new Maximin $\Phi_p$-Efficient (or Mm-$\Phi_p$ for short) design
which aims at maximizing the minimum $\Phi_p$-efficiency under model
uncertainties. Based on the theoretical properties of the proposed criterion,
we develop an efficient algorithm with sound convergence properties to
construct the Mm-$\Phi_p$ design. The performance of the proposed Mm-$\Phi_p$
design is assessed through several numerical examples.

procedure of experimenting to compare two treatments applied to test subjects.
For example, many IT companies frequently conduct A/B tests on their users who
are connected and form social networks. Often, the users' responses could be
related to the network connection. In this paper, we assume that the users, or
the test subjects of the experiments, are connected on an undirected network,
and the responses of two connected users are correlated. We include the
treatment assignment, covariate features, and network connection in a
conditional autoregressive model. Based on this model, we propose a design
criterion that measures the variance of the estimated treatment effect and
allocate the treatment settings to the test subjects by minimizing the
criterion. Since the design criterion depends on an unknown network correlation
parameter, we adopt the locally optimal design method and develop a hybrid
optimization approach to obtain the optimal design. Through synthetic and real
social network examples, we demonstrate the value of including network
dependence in designing A/B experiments and validate that the proposed locally
optimal design is robust to the choices of parameters.

two-dimensional (2D) materials with technically robust properties that can be
finely tuned by planar surface functionalization. Herein, the critical role of
oxygen (O-) functionalization on the tensile mechanical characteristics of
thinnest 2D Ti2C MXene is explored by molecular dynamic (MD) simulation with
first-principle based ReaxFF forcefield. It is demonstrated that Ti2C sheet
shows unique tensile mechanical behaviors that pronouncedly vary with the
content of O-functionalization and stretching direction. Upon both loading
directions, there is an apparent crossover in the Young's modulus, failure
strength and failure strain. Intriguingly, under armchair directional load, a
structural transition of 1T to 1T' phase occurs in the Ti2C region, which has
been observed in many transition metal dichalcogenides. Upon zigzag directional
straining, however, two distinct structural transformations take place in
pristine and fully O-functionalized Ti2C sheets, respectively. As the load is
removed, those three structural transformations are reversible, and they are
critically understood by analysis of the bond configurations. The study
provides important insights into mechanical behaviors and structural
transformations of functionalized MXenes.

decay of Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons in the context of ""extended"" warped
extra-dimensional models, where the standard model (SM) Higgs and fermion
fields are restricted to be in-between the usual ultraviolet/Planck brane and a
$\sim O(10)$ TeV (new, ""intermediate"") brane, whereas the SM gauge fields (and
gravity) propagate further down to the $\sim O( \hbox{TeV} )$ infrared brane.
Such a framework suppresses flavor violation stemming from KK particle effects,
while keeping the KK gauge bosons and gravitons accessible to the LHC. We find
that the signals from KK graviton are significantly different than in the
standard warped model. This is because the usually dominant decay modes of KK
gravitons into top quark, Higgs and longitudinal $W/Z$ particles are suppressed
by the above spatial separation between these two sets of particles, thus other
decay channels are allowed to shine themselves. In particular, we focus on two
novel decay channels of the KK graviton. The first one is the decay into a pair
of radions, each of which decays (dominantly) into a pair of SM gluons,
resulting in a resonant 4-jet final state consisting of two pairs of dijet
resonance. On the other hand, if the radion is heavier and/or KK gluon is
lighter, then the KK graviton mostly decays into a KK gluon and a SM gluon. The
resulting KK gluon has a significant decay branching fraction into radion and
SM gluon, thereby generating (again) a 4-jet signature, but with a different
underlying event topology, i.e., featuring now three different resonances. We
demonstrate that the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) has sensitivity to KK
graviton of (up to) $\sim 4$ TeV in both channels, whereas it is unlikely to
have sensitivity in the standard dijet resonance search channel from KK
graviton decay into two gluons.

angles below $60^\circ$. A key feature of the work is that the estimates of the
energies are independent of assumptions about the unknown hadronic physics or
of the primary mass composition. The measurement is the most precise made
hitherto with the accumulated exposure being so large that the measurements of
the flux are dominated by systematic uncertainties except at energies above $5
{\times} 10^{19}~$eV. The principal conclusions are: (1) The flattening of the
spectrum near $5 {\times} 10^{18}~$eV, the so-called ""ankle"", is confirmed. (2)
The steepening of the spectrum at around $5 {\times} 10^{19}~$eV is confirmed.
(3) A new feature has been identified in the spectrum: in the region above the
ankle the spectral index $\gamma$ of the particle flux ($\propto E^{-\gamma}$)
changes from $2.51 \pm 0.03~{\rm (stat.)} \pm 0.05~{\rm (sys.)}$ to $3.05 \pm

evidence for any dependence of the spectrum on declination has been found other
than a mild excess from the Southern Hemisphere that is consistent with the
anisotropy observed above $8 {\times} 10^{18}~$eV.

different negative confidences during the classifier's training. We use the
review helpfulness classification as a test case for examining the

different datasets, namely one from Yelp (venue reviews), and two from Amazon
(Kindle and Electronics reviews). Our results show that NCWS outperforms strong
baselines from the literature including an existing SVM-based approach (i.e.
SVM-P), the positive and unlabelled learning-based approach (i.e. C-PU) and the
positive confidence-based approach (i.e. P-conf) in addressing the classifier's
bias problem. Moreover, we further examine the effectiveness of NCWS by using
its classified helpful reviews in a state-of-the-art review-based venue
recommendation model (i.e. DeepCoNN) and demonstrate the benefits of using NCWS
in enhancing venue recommendation effectiveness in comparison to the baselines.

fostering a more comprehensive understanding of physical phenomena pertaining

advancements, these models contain inherent biases due to parameterization and
linearization of the differential equations that reduce forecasting accuracy.
In this work, we investigate the use of a computationally efficient deep
learning method, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), as a post-processing
technique that improves mesoscale Weather and Research Forecasting (WRF) one
day forecast (with a one-hour temporal resolution) outputs. Using the CNN
architecture, we bias-correct several meteorological parameters calculated by
the WRF model for all of 2018. We train the CNN model with a four-year history
(2014-2017) to investigate the patterns in WRF biases and then reduce these
biases in forecasts for surface wind speed and direction, precipitation,
relative humidity, surface pressure, dewpoint temperature, and surface
temperature. The WRF data, with a spatial resolution of 27 km, covers South
Korea. We obtain ground observations from the Korean Meteorological
Administration station network for 93 weather station locations. The results
indicate a noticeable improvement in WRF forecasts in all station locations.
The average of annual index of agreement for surface wind, precipitation,
surface pressure, temperature, dewpoint temperature and relative humidity of
all stations are 0.85 (WRF:0.67), 0.62 (WRF:0.56), 0.91 (WRF:0.69), 0.99

study focuses on South Korea, the proposed approach can be applied for any
measured weather parameters at any location.

information remains a fundamental challenge. While for two-player zero-sum
games, coordinate-ascent approaches (optimizing one agent's policy at a time,
e.g., self-play) work with guarantees, in multi-agent cooperative setting they
often converge to sub-optimal Nash equilibrium. On the other hand, directly
modeling joint policy changes in imperfect information game is nontrivial due
to complicated interplay of policies (e.g., upstream updates affect downstream
state reachability). In this paper, we show global changes of game values can
be decomposed to policy changes localized at each information set, with a novel
term named policy-change density. Based on this, we propose Joint Policy
Search(JPS) that iteratively improves joint policies of collaborative agents in
imperfect information games, without re-evaluating the entire game. On
multi-agent collaborative tabular games, JPS is proven to never worsen
performance and can improve solutions provided by unilateral approaches (e.g,
CFR), outperforming algorithms designed for collaborative policy learning (e.g.
BAD). Furthermore, for real-world games, JPS has an online form that naturally
links with gradient updates. We test it to Contract Bridge, a 4-player
imperfect-information game where a team of $2$ collaborates to compete against
the other. In its bidding phase, players bid in turn to find a good contract
through a limited information channel. Based on a strong baseline agent that
bids competitive bridge purely through domain-agnostic self-play, JPS improves
collaboration of team players and outperforms WBridge5, a championship-winning
software, by $+0.63$ IMPs (International Matching Points) per board over 1k
games, substantially better than previous SoTA ($+0.41$ IMPs/b) under

Experimentally visualizing the detailed sub-wavelength structure of these modes
propagating along the interface between two topologically non-trivial

differentiate between the contributions of several higher-order Bloch
harmonics. Selective probing of forward and backward propagating modes as
defined by their phase velocities enables a direct quantification of
topological robustness. Studying near-field propagation in controlled defects
allows to extract upper limits to topological protection in on-chip photonic
systems in comparison to conventional PhC waveguides. We find that protected
edge states are two orders of magnitude more robust as compared to conventional
PhC waveguides. This direct experimental quantification of topological
robustness comprises a crucial step towards the application of topologically
protected guiding in integrated photonics, allowing for unprecedented

GUT, the discrete $X$ can be either a global symmetry or gauged. In the
$so(10)$ GUT, the $X$ must become gauged, the 5d TQFT becomes noninvertible and
long-range entangled (which can couple to dynamical gravity). In this work, we
further examine the anomaly and cobordism constraints at higher energy scales

Spin(18) gauge groups precisely). We also find [2006.16996]'s proposal on new

the energy/mass hierarchy. Novel ingredients along tuning the energy include
various energy scales of anomaly-free symmetric mass generation (i.e.,

topological order (attachable to a 5d $\mathbb{Z}_{4,X}$-symmetric topological

many distinct species of fermions with quasi-degenerate masses and no couplings

the mass of the sun, on orbits of several hours. These companions are
presumably the remnants of main sequence stars that lost their mass through a
combination of Roche-lobe overflow and ablation by the host pulsar's
high-energy radiation. While ablation itself is too weak to significantly
reduce the mass of the companion star, the ablated wind couples to its magnetic
field, removes orbital angular momentum, and thus maintains stable Roche-lobe
overflow. We use the MESA stellar evolution code, complemented by analytic
estimates, to track initially main sequence companions as they are reduced to a
fraction of their original mass by this ablation-driven magnetic braking. We
argue that magnetic braking remains effective even for low-mass companions. A
key ingredient of our model is that the irradiating luminosity of the pulsar
$L_{\rm irr}$ deposits energy in the companion's atmosphere and thereby slows
down its Kelvin-Helmholtz cooling. We find that the high-energy luminosities
measured by Fermi $L_{\rm irr}=0.1-3\,{\rm L}_\odot$ can explain the span of
black widow orbital periods. The same $L_{\rm irr}$ range reproduces the
companions' night-side temperatures, which cluster around 3000 K, as inferred
from optical light curves.

  Letters",,"10.3847/2041-8213/abae6f",,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) are generally thought to result from the
merger of two neutron stars or the merger of a neutron star with a black hole.
It is becoming standard practise to model these mergers with hydrodynamical
simulations that employ equations of state that are derived, for example, for
determining the behaviour of matter in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), and
which therefore make use of the assumption that the matter is hot and in
nuclear statistical equilibrium (NSE). In this Letter we draw attention to the
fact that the hydrodynamical timescale (roughly the gravitational timescale of
the neutron star) may be several orders of magnitude shorter than the timescale
on which such equilibrium can be re-established in the tidal debris ejected
during a sGRB, and that on the initial decompression timescales the unshocked
tidal ejecta may remain sufficiently cool that the employed equations of state
are not appropriate for modelling the dynamics of this part of the flow. On
timescales short compared with the timescale on which NSE can be
(re)established, the equation of state can remain relatively stiff and thus the
stream of tidal debris can remain narrow and vulnerable to gravitational
instability, as has recently been suggested. These findings suggest that
estimates of the type and abundances of heavy elements formed in short
gamma-ray bursts need to be revisited. We suggest that the most direct method
of testing the physical and dynamical properties of tidal ejecta in sGRBs will
come from modelling of their light curves, which provides the cleanest source
of information on the system dynamics.

surrounding the supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the Galactic Center (GC) is
expected to include a binary population. In this dense environment, a binary
frequently encounters and interacts with neighboring stars. These interactions
vary from small perturbations to violent collisions. In the former case, weak
gravitational interactions unbind a soft binary over the evaporation timescale,
which depends on the binary properties as well as the density of surrounding
objects and velocity dispersion. Similarly, collisions can also unbind a
binary, and the collision rate depends on the density. Thus, the detection of a
binary with known properties can constrain the density profile in the GC with
implications for the number of compact objects, which are otherwise challenging
to detect. We estimate the density necessary to unbind a binary within its
lifetime for an orbit of arbitrary eccentricity about the SMBH. We find that
the eccentricity has a minimal impact on the density constraint. In this proof
of concept, we demonstrate that this procedure can probe the density in the GC
using hypothetical young and old binaries as examples. Similarly, a known
density profile provides constraints on the binary orbital separation. Our
results highlight the need to consider multiple dynamical processes in tandem.
In certain cases, often closer to the SMBH, the collision timescale rather than
the evaporation timescale gives the more stringent density constraint, while
other binaries farther from the SMBH provide unreliable density constraints
because they migrate inwards due to mass segregation.

dimensional materials has been proposed via cavity-mediated pairing. The
cavity-mediated electron-electron interactions are long range, which has two
main effects: firstly, within the standard BCS-type pairing mediated by
adiabatic photons, the superconducting critical temperature depends
polynomially on the coupling strength, instead of the exponential dependence
characterizing the phonon-mediated pairing; secondly, as we show here, the
effect of photon fluctuations is significantly enhanced. These mediate novel
non-BCS-type pairing processes, via non-adiabatic photons, which are not
sensitive to the electron occupation but rather to the electron dispersion and
lifetime at the Fermi surface. Therefore, while the leading temperature
dependence of BCS pairing comes from the smoothening of the Fermi-Dirac
distribution, the temperature dependence of the fluctuation-induced pairing
comes from the electron lifetime. For realistic parameters, also including
cavity loss, this results into a critical temperature which can be more than
one order of magnitude larger than the BCS prediction. Moreover, a finite
average number photons (as can be achieved by incoherently pumping the cavity)
adds to the fluctuations and leads to a further enhancement of the critical
temperature.

are described as conditional probability functions of $M_{\ast}$. We convolve
them with the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) of SFGs to derive the FUV and
IR LFs. The 2 SF modes formalism is used to describe starburst galaxies. By
fitting observed FUV and IR LFs, the parametrization of SFR$_{\rm
FUV}-M_{\ast}$ and SFR$_{\rm IR}-M_{\ast}$ are constrained. Our derived
SFR$_{\rm FUV+IR}-M_{\ast}$ reproduces the evolution of the MS as compared to
other observational inferences. At any redshift, we find that the sSFR$_{\rm
FUV+IR}-M_{\ast}$ relation for MS SFGs approaches to a power law at the
high-mass end. At lower masses, it bends and eventually the slope sign changes
from negative to positive at very low masses. At $z\sim0$, this change of sign
is at $M_{\ast}\sim5\times10^{8}{\rm M}_{\odot}$ close to dust-obscured SF
regime, $M_{\ast}\sim6\times10^{8}{\rm M}_{\odot}$. The slope sign change is
related to the knee of the FUV LF. Our derived dust-obscured fractions agree
with previous determinations at $0\leq z\leq2.5$. Dust-obscured fractions
depend strongly on mass with almost no dependence with redshift at
$z\gtrsim1.2$. At $z\lesssim0.75$ high-mass galaxies become more ""transparent""
compared to their high redshift counterparts. On the opposite, low- and
intermediate-mass galaxies have become more obscured by dust. The joint
evolution of the GSMF and the FUV and IR LFs is a promising approach to study
mass growth and dust formation/destruction mechanisms.

physics of the Mott insulating parent state is well captured by a
two-dimensional spin $S$ = 1/2 antiferromagnetic (AFM) Heisenberg model.
However, recent observations of a large thermal Hall conductivity in several
parent cuprates appear to defy this simple model and suggest proximity to a
magneto-chiral state that breaks all mirror planes perpendicular to the CuO$_2$
layers. Here we use optical second harmonic generation to directly resolve the
point group symmetries of the model parent cuprate Sr$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$. We
report evidence of an order parameter $\Phi$ that breaks all perpendicular
mirror planes and is consistent with a magneto-chiral state in zero magnetic
field. Although $\Phi$ is clearly coupled to the AFM order parameter, we are
unable to realize its time-reversed partner ($-\Phi$) by thermal cycling
through the AFM transition temperature ($T_{\textrm{N}}$ $\approx$ 260 K) or by
sampling different spatial locations. This suggests that $\Phi$ onsets above
$T_{\textrm{N}}$ and may be relevant to the mechanism of pseudogap formation.

are well resolved. Four of them are larger in band 7 than in band 4 in the
radial direction, and three have a similar radial extent in all bands. For all
disks, we also derive the millimeter brightness temperature and spectral index
maps. We find that the disks are likely optically thick and that the dust
emission reveals low brightness temperatures in most cases (<10K). The
integrated spectral indices are similar to those of disks at lower inclination.
The comparison of a generic radiative transfer disk model with our data shows
that at least 3 disks are consistent with a small millimeter dust scale height,
of a few au (measured at r=100au). This is in contrast with the more classical
value of h_g\sim10au derived from scattered light images and from gas line
measurements. These results confirm, by direct observations, that large
(millimeter) grains are subject to significant vertical settling in
protoplanetary disks.

on the generalized hydrodynamics theory for a partitioning protocol and showed
the presence of a clogging phenomenon. Clogging is a phenomenon that vanishing
charge current coexists with nonzero energy current, and was found when the
protocol uses the initial condition that the left half of the system is
prepared to be half filling at high temperatures with the right half being
empty. Clogging occurs at all the sites in the left half and lasts for a time
proportional to its distance from the connection point. In this paper, we use
various different initial conditions and discuss two issues. The first issue is
the possibility of clogging in a stationary state. When the electron density in
the right half is initially set nonzero, we found that the left half-filled
part expands for various sets of parameters in the initial condition. This
means that the clogging phenomenon occurs at all the sites in the long-time
stationary state, and we also discuss its origin. In addition, stationary
clogging is accompanied by a back current, namely, particle density current
flows towards the high-density region. We also found spin clogging occurs for
some initial conditions, i.e., the vanishing spin current coexists with nonzero
energy current. The second issue is the proportionality of spin and charge
currents. We have found two spatio-temporal regions where the current ratio is
fixed to a nonzero constant. We numerically studied how the current ratio
depends on various initial conditions. We also studied the ratio of charge and

transfer physics and also that significant high momentum content of wave
functions is inevitable. The nuclear size is connected via the independent-pair

connected via the concept of virtuality to the EMC effect. An explanation of
the latter is presented in terms of light-front holographic wave functions of

particular, this enables us to derive the optimal approximate DP parameters of
a mechanism that satisfies a given level of RDP. As an application, we apply
our result to the moments accountant framework for characterizing privacy

including in data-driven science and engineering. A major application problem
is data-driven forecasting of future states from a complex dynamical.
Artificial neural networks (ANN) have evolved as a clear leader amongst many
machine learning approaches, and recurrent neural networks (RNN) are considered
to be especially well suited for forecasting dynamical systems. In this
setting, the echo state networks (ESN) or reservoir computer (RC) have emerged
for their simplicity and computational complexity advantages. Instead of a
fully trained network, an RC trains only read-out weights by a simple,
efficient least squares method. What is perhaps quite surprising is that
nonetheless an RC succeeds to make high quality forecasts, competitively with
more intensively trained methods, even if not the leader. There remains an
unanswered question as to why and how an RC works at all, despite randomly
selected weights. We explicitly connect the RC with linear activation and
linear read-out to well developed time-series literature on vector
autoregressive averages (VAR) that includes theorems on representability
through the WOLD theorem, which already perform reasonably for short term
forecasts. In the case of a linear activation and now popular quadratic
read-out RC, we explicitly connect to a nonlinear VAR (NVAR), which performs
quite well. Further, we associate this paradigm to the now widely popular
dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), and thus these three are in a sense different
faces of the same thing. We illustrate our observations in terms of popular
benchmark examples including Mackey-Glass differential delay equations and the

reliability of command line utilities. In the basic fuzz tradition, we debugged
each failed utility and categorized the causes the failures. Classic categories
of failures, such as pointer and array errors and not checking return codes,
were still broadly present in the current results. In addition, we found a
couple of new categories of failures appearing. We present examples of these
failures to illustrate the programming practices that allowed them to happen.
As a side note, we tested the limited number of utilities available in a modern

relationship between the solar wind speed observed at 1 AU and the rate of
magnetic flux tube expansion (FTE) between the photosphere and the inner
corona, where FTE is computed by coronal models that take the photospheric flux
density synoptic maps as their inner boundary conditions to extrapolate the
photospheric magnetic fields to deduce the coronal and the heliospheric
magnetic field configuration. Since these synoptic maps are among the most
widely-used of all solar magnetic data products, the uncertainties in the model
predictions that are caused by the uncertainties in the synoptic maps are
worthy of study. However, such an estimate related to synoptic map construction
was not available until Bertello et al. (Solar Physics, 289, 2014) obtained the
spatial standard deviation synoptic maps; 98 Monte-Carlo realizations of the
spatial standard deviation maps for each photospheric synoptic maps. In this
paper, we present an estimate of uncertainties in the solar wind speed
predicted at 1 AU by the CSSS model due to the uncertainties in the
photospheric synoptic maps. We also present a comparison of the coronal hole
locations predicted by the models with the STEREO/SECCHI EUV synoptic maps. In
order to quantify the extent of the uncertainties involved, we compared the
predicted speeds with the OMNI solar wind data during the same period (taking
the solar wind transit time into account) and obtained the root mean square
error between them. To illustrate the significance of the uncertainty estimate
in the solar wind prediction, we carried out the analysis for three Carrington
rotations, CR 2102, CR 2137 and CR 2160 at different phases of the solar cycle.
The uncertainty estimate is critical information necessary for the current and

is of paramount importance for the extraction of cosmological information from

various semi-analytic models (SAMs) we explore the SFR-DM connection in
relation to the speed-from-light method (Feix et al. 2016) for inferring the
growth rate, $f$, from luminosity/SFR shifts. Emphasis is given to the
dependence of the SFR distribution on the environment density on scales of
10s-100s Mpc. We show that the application of the speed-from-light method to an
Euclid-like survey is not biased by environmental effects. In all models, the
precision on the measured $\beta=f/b$ parameter is $\sigma_\beta < 0.17$ at
$z=1$. This translates into errors of $\sigma_f \sim 0.22$ and
$\sigma_{(f\sigma_8)}\sim 0.1$, without invoking assumptions on the mass power
spectrum. These errors are in the same ballpark as recent analyses of the
redshift space distortions in galaxy clustering. In agreement with previous
studies, the bias factor, $b$ is roughly a scale-independent, constant function
of the SFR for star forming galaxies. Its value at $z=1$ ranges from $1.2$ to
$1.5$ depending on the SAM recipe. Although in all SAMs denser environments
host galaxies with higher stellar masses, the dependence of the SFR on the
environment is more involved. In most models the SFR probability distribution
is skewed to larger values in denser regions. One model exhibits an inverted
trend where high SFR is suppressed in dense environment.

incomplete matrix using low-rank assumptions. To ensure that the matrix
solution has a low rank, a recent trend is to use nonconvex regularizers that
adaptively penalize singular values. They offer good recovery performance and
have nice theoretical properties, but are computationally expensive due to
repeated access to individual singular values. In this paper, based on the key
insight that adaptive shrinkage on singular values improve empirical
performance, we propose a new nonconvex low-rank regularizer called ""nuclear
norm minus Frobenius norm"" regularizer, which is scalable, adaptive and sound.
We first show it provably holds the adaptive shrinkage property. Further, we
discover its factored form which bypasses the computation of singular values
and allows fast optimization by general optimization algorithms. Stable
recovery and convergence are guaranteed. Extensive low-rank matrix completion
experiments on a number of synthetic and real-world data sets show that the
proposed method obtains state-of-the-art recovery performance while being the
fastest in comparison to existing low-rank matrix learning methods.

the expense of considerable computation load. To relieve the computation load,
many optimization works are developed to reduce the model redundancy by
identifying and removing insignificant model components, such as weight
sparsity and filter pruning. However, these works only evaluate model
components' static significance with internal parameter information, ignoring
their dynamic interaction with external inputs. With per-input feature
activation, the model component significance can dynamically change, and thus
the static methods can only achieve sub-optimal results. Therefore, we propose
a dynamic CNN optimization framework in this work. Based on the neural network
attention mechanism, we propose a comprehensive dynamic optimization framework
including (1) testing-phase channel and column feature map pruning, as well as
(2) training-phase optimization by targeted dropout. Such a dynamic
optimization framework has several benefits: (1) First, it can accurately
identify and aggressively remove per-input feature redundancy with considering
the model-input interaction; (2) Meanwhile, it can maximally remove the feature
map redundancy in various dimensions thanks to the multi-dimension flexibility;
(3) The training-testing co-optimization favors the dynamic pruning and helps
maintain the model accuracy even with very high feature pruning ratio.
Extensive experiments show that our method could bring 37.4% to 54.5% FLOPs
reduction with negligible accuracy drop on various of test networks.

candidate as the solution to a convex program. The learner then queries the
verifier, which solves a mixed-integer program to either validate the proposed
Lyapunov function candidate or reject it with a counterexample, i.e., a state
where the stability condition fails. This counterexample is then added to the
sample set of the learner to refine the set of Lyapunov function candidates. We
design the learner and the verifier based on the analytic center cutting-plane
method, in which the verifier acts as the cutting-plane oracle to refine the
set of Lyapunov function candidates. We show that when the set of Lyapunov
functions is full-dimensional in the parameter space, the overall procedure
finds a Lyapunov function in a finite number of iterations. We demonstrate the
utility of the proposed method in searching for quadratic and piecewise

(seen or unseen during training) in a natural image via sketch query. We refer
to this problem as sketch-guided object localization. This problem is
distinctively different from the traditional sketch-based image retrieval task
where the gallery set often contains images with only one object. The
sketch-guided object localization proves to be more challenging when we
consider the following: (i) the sketches used as queries are abstract
representations with little information on the shape and salient attributes of
the object, (ii) the sketches have significant variability as they are
hand-drawn by a diverse set of untrained human subjects, and (iii) there exists
a domain gap between sketch queries and target natural images as these are
sampled from very different data distributions. To address the problem of
sketch-guided object localization, we propose a novel cross-modal attention
scheme that guides the region proposal network (RPN) to generate object
proposals relevant to the sketch query. These object proposals are later scored
against the query to obtain final localization. Our method is effective with as
little as a single sketch query. Moreover, it also generalizes well to object
categories not seen during training and is effective in localizing multiple
object instances present in the image. Furthermore, we extend our framework to
a multi-query setting using novel feature fusion and attention fusion
strategies introduced in this paper. The localization performance is evaluated
on publicly available object detection benchmarks, viz. MS-COCO and PASCAL-VOC,

to guide the process of identifying regions of the search space that contain as

from a predicted set that minimizes 0/1 error and accurate identification could
require very different sampling strategies. Like active learning for binary
classification, this experimental design cannot be optimally chosen a priori,

classification with 0/1 error, collecting data adaptively to find a set with
high true positive rate and low false discovery rate (FDR) is not as well

  Dynamical Systems",,,,,"physics.comp-ph stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Industrial dynamical systems often exhibit multi-scale response due to
material heterogeneities, operation conditions and complex environmental
loadings. In such problems, it is the case that the smallest length-scale of
the systems dynamics controls the numerical resolution required to effectively
resolve the embedded physics. In practice however, high numerical resolutions
is only required in a confined region of the system where fast dynamics or
localized material variability are exhibited, whereas a coarser discretization
can be sufficient in the rest majority of the system. To this end, a unified
computational scheme with uniform spatio-temporal resolutions for uncertainty
quantification can be very computationally demanding. Partitioning the complex
dynamical system into smaller easier-to-solve problems based of the localized
dynamics and material variability can reduce the overall computational cost.
However, identifying the region of interest for high-resolution and intensive
uncertainty quantification can be a problem dependent. The region of interest
can be specified based on the localization features of the solution, user
interest, and correlation length of the random material properties. For
problems where a region of interest is not evident, Bayesian inference can
provide a feasible solution. In this work, we employ a Bayesian framework to
update our prior knowledge on the localized region of interest using
measurements and system response. To address the computational cost of the
Bayesian inference, we construct a Gaussian process surrogate for the forward
model. Once, the localized region of interest is identified, we use polynomial
chaos expansion to propagate the localization uncertainty. We demonstrate our
framework through numerical experiments on a three-dimensional elastodynamic
problem.

superluminal velocities but restricts local speeds to subluminal ones as

The electronic energies are calculated on a quantum computer using the
variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method. We compute the energy gradients
numerically using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, finite differences, and a
correlated sampling technique. Our method only requires additional classical
calculations of electron integrals for each degree of freedom, without any
additional computations on a quantum computer beyond the initial VQE run. To
achieve comparable accuracy, our gradient calculation method requires three to
five orders of magnitude fewer measurements than other brute force methods
without correlated sampling. As a proof of concept, AIMD dynamics simulations
are demonstrated for the H2 molecule on IBM quantum devices. To the best of our
knowledge, it is the first successful attempt to run AIMD on quantum devices
for a chemical system. In addition, we demonstrate the validity of the method
for larger molecules using full configuration interaction (FCI) wave functions.
As quantum hardware and noise mitigation techniques continue to improve, the

systematic search for cool and luminous stars in the Magellanic Clouds with

Thorne-\.Zytkow Object (T\.ZO) candidate HV2112. Using light curves from
ASAS-SN we identify 38 stars with surface temperatures T $<$ 4800K,
luminosities $\log$(L/L$_\odot$) $>$ 4.3, variability periods $>$ 400 days, and
variability amplitudes $\Delta$V $>$ 2.5 mag. Eleven of these stars possess the
distinctive double-peaked light curve morphology of HV2112. We use the
pulsation properties and derived occurrence rates for these 12 objects to
constrain their nature. From comparisons to stellar populations and models, we
find that one star may be a red supergiant with large amplitude pulsations. For
the other 11 stars we derive current masses of $\sim$5-10 M$_{\odot}$, below
the theoretical minimum mass of $\sim$15 M$_{\odot}$ for T\.ZOs to be stable,
casting doubt on this interpretation. Instead, we find that the temperatures,
luminosities, mass-loss rates, and periods of these stars are consistent with
predictions for super-Asymptotic Giant Branch (s-AGB) stars that have begun
carbon burning but have not reached the superwind phase. We infer lifetimes in
this phase of $\sim($1$-$7) $\times$ 10$^{4}$ years, also consistent with an
s-AGB interpretation. If confirmed, these objects would represent the first
identified population of s-AGB stars, illuminating the transition between low-

hole event horizons as usual and the singularity is not naked, in agreement
with the cosmic censorship. On the other hand, for flat or de Sitter space, the
earlier solution has also a cosmic-censorship problem because there are no
conventional black hole horizons as in Einstein gravity, other than the usual
cosmological horizon for the latter case, so that the singularity could be
naked in Horava gravity. However, with the help of recent corrections, I show
that the solutions have a peculiar black hole horizon at the origin so that the
singularity is not naked even without the conventional black hole horizons in
flat or de Sitter case, due to the Lorentz-violating higher-derivative terms.
On the other hand, I note also that a new ``cosmological"" horizon exists even
for the flat case, contrary to the usual wisdom, due to combined effects of the
higher derivatives and the angular-momentum barrier. I study an unified
treatment of their unusual black hole thermodynamics for the flat and de Sitter
spaces, as well as the anti-de Sitter space, which might be due to lack of the
absolute horizons in the Lorentz-violating gravity.

sensitive, moderate-to-high resolution UV spectrograph. However, sensitive
observations in the UV are difficult, as UV optical performance and imaging
efficiencies have lagged behind counterparts in the visible and infrared
regimes. This has historically resulted in simple, low-bounce instruments to
increase sensitivity. In this study, we present the design, fabrication, and
calibration of a simple, high resolution, high throughput far-UV spectrograph -
the Colorado High-resolution Echelle Stellar Spectrograph (CHESS). CHESS is a

next-generation UV space telescopes. We present tests and results on the
performance of several state-of-the-art diffraction grating and detector
technologies for far-UV astronomical applications that were flown aboard the
first two iterations of CHESS. The CHESS spectrograph was used to study the
atomic-to-molecular transitions within translucent cloud regions in the

transport in stenotic aortic models with morphology, mechanical and optical
properties close to those of real arteries. To this end, vorticity, particle
residence time (PRT), particle's final position (FP) and finite time Lyapunov's
exponents (FTLE) were computed from the experimental fluid velocity fields
acquired using ultrasonic particle imaging velocimetry (Echo-PIV). For the
experiments, CT-images were used to create morphological realistic models of
the descending aorta with 0%, 35% and 50% occlusion degree with same mechanical
properties as real arteries. Each model was connected to a circuit with a
pulsatile programmable pump which mimics physiological flow and pressure
conditions. The pulsatile frequency was set to 0.9 Hz (55 bpm) and the upstream
peak Reynolds number (Re) was changed from 1100 to 2000. Flow in the
post-stenotic region was composed of two main structures: a high velocity jet
over the stenosis throat and a recirculation region behind the stenosis where
vortex form and shed. We characterized vortex kinematics showing that vortex
propagation velocity increases with Re. Moreover, from the FTLE field we
identified Lagrangian Coherent Structures (i.e. material barriers) that dictate
transport behind the stenosis. The size and strength of those barriers
increased with Re and the occlusion degree. Finally, from the PRT and FP, we
showed that independently of Re, the same amount of fluid remains on the
stenosis over more than a pulsatile period, which combined with large FTLE
values may provide an alternative way to understand stenosis growth.

joint representations to attend to visual features and auditory features,

features are produced, and thus both features can enjoy the mutually improved
benefits from each other. It is worth noting that the joint co-attention unit
is recursive meaning that it can be performed multiple times for obtaining
better joint representations progressively. Extensive experiments on the public

results than the state-of-the-art methods.

both worst-case and average-case fine-grained hard assuming the core hypotheses
of FGC. We then use these as a basis for fine-grained hardness and average-case
hardness of other problems. The new problems represent their inputs in a

``factored''-zero-$k$-clique and ``factored''-$3$SUM. We show that
factored-$k$-OV and factored $k$SUM are equivalent and are complete for a class
of problems defined over Boolean functions. Factored zero-$k$-clique is also
complete, for a different class of problems.
  Our hard factored problems are also simple enough that we can reduce them to
many other problems, e.g.~to edit distance, $k$-LCS and versions of Max-Flow.
We further consider counting variants of the factored problems and give
WCtoACFG reductions for them for a natural distribution. Through FGC reductions
we then get average-case hardness for well-studied problems like regular
expression matching from standard worst-case FGC assumptions.
  To obtain our WCtoACFG reductions, we formalize the framework of [Boix-Adsera
et al. 2019] that was used to give a WCtoACFG reduction for counting
$k$-cliques. We define an explicit property of problems such that if a problem
has that property one can use the framework on the problem to get a WCtoACFG
self reduction. We then use the framework to slightly extend Boix-Adsera et

by which the attention received by cultural pieces decays as time passes.
Recent work modeled this decay as the result of two different processes, one
linked to communicative memory --memories sustained by human communication--
and cultural memory --memories sustained by the physical recording of content.
Yet, little is known on how the collective forgetting dynamic changes over
time. Are older cultural pieces forgotten at a lower rate than newer ones?
Here, we study the temporal changes of collective memory and attention by
focusing on two knowledge communities: inventors and physicists. We use data on
patents from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and physics
papers published in the American Physical Society (APS) to quantify how
collective forgetting has changed over time. The model enables us to
distinguish between two branches of forgetting. One branch is short-lived,
going directly from communicative memory to oblivion. The other one is
long-lived going from communicative to cultural memory and then to oblivion.
The data analysis shows an increasing forgetting rate for both communities as
the information grows. Furthermore, these knowledge communities seem to be

assess the model fit and determine the number of latent factors. Despite its
popularity and clear statistical rationale, researchers have found that when
the dimension of the response data is large compared to the sample size, the
classical chi-square approximation of the likelihood ratio test statistic often
fails. Theoretically, it has been an open problem when such a phenomenon
happens as the dimension of data increases; practically, the effect of high
dimensionality is less examined in exploratory factor analysis, and there lacks
a clear statistical guideline on the validity of the conventional chi-square

chi-square approximation of the likelihood ratio test in high-dimensional
exploratory factor analysis, and derive the necessary and sufficient condition
to ensure the validity of the chi-square approximation. The results yield
simple quantitative guidelines to check in practice and would also provide

course at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) was recently transformed,
measurement uncertainty was the focus of a learning goal of that
transformation. The Physics Measurement Questionnaire (PMQ), a research-based
assessment of student understanding around statistical measurement uncertainty,
was used to measure the effectiveness of that transformation. Here, we analyze
student responses to the PMQ at the beginning and end of the CU course. We also
compare such responses from two semesters: one before and one after the

their reasoning in ways aligned with the measurement uncertainty learning goal.
Furthermore, we show that more students in the transformed semester shifted in

multi-agent system (MAS) is time-consuming since it involves solving a
large-size matrix Riccati equation. The situation is further exasperated when
the design needs to be done in a model-free way using schemes such as
reinforcement learning (RL). To reduce this computational complexity, we
decompose the large-scale LQR design problem into multiple smaller-size LQR
design problems. We consider the objective function to be specified over an
undirected graph, and cast the decomposition as a graph clustering problem. The
graph is decomposed into two parts, one consisting of independent clusters of
connected components, and the other containing edges that connect different
clusters. Accordingly, the resulting controller has a hierarchical structure,
consisting of two components. The first component optimizes the performance of
each independent cluster by solving the smaller-size LQR design problem in a
model-free way using an RL algorithm. The second component accounts for the
objective coupling different clusters, which is achieved by solving a least
squares problem in one shot. Although suboptimal, the hierarchical controller
adheres to a particular structure as specified by inter-agent couplings in the
objective function and by the decomposition strategy. Mathematical formulations
are established to find a decomposition that minimizes the number of required
communication links or reduces the optimality gap. Numerical simulations are
provided to highlight the pros and cons of the proposed designs.

research of eukaryogenesis away from models focusing on endocytosis and the
rapid acquisition of the alphaproteobacteria that would become the
mitochondria. Imachi and colleagues proposed that ancestors of the Loki lived
symbiotically with other prokaryotes due to its shape, and facilitated
molecular transfer between the symbionts as well as the membrane manipulation
necessary to allow such transfer, before acquiring a proto-mitochondria over

basis sets proposed in the literature, namely calculations in the Kohn--Sham

optimized basis sets accelerate the convergence of the AFQMC correlation energy
compared to a Kohn--Sham basis, and offer similar convergence to MP2 natural
orbitals at a fraction of the cost needed to generate them. We also suggest the
use of an improved, method independent, MP2-based basis set correction that
significantly reduces the required basis set sizes needed to converge the
correlation energy. With these developments, we study the relative performance
of these basis sets in LiH, Si and MgO, and determine that our optimized basis
sets yield the most consistent results as a function of volume. Using these

unintended consequences like giving ultimate power for devices' owners over
their intimate partners in the same household which might lead to
tech-facilitated domestic abuse (tech-abuse) as recent research has shown. In
this paper, we systematize findings on tech-abuse in smart homes. We show that
domestic abuse and Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) in smart homes is more
effective and less risky for abusers. Victims find it more harmful and more
challenging to protect themselves from. We articulate a comprehensive analysis
of all the phases of abuse in smart homes and categorize risks and needs in
each phase. Technical analysis of current smart home technologies is conducted
to shed light upon their limitations. We also summarize recent recommendations
to combat tech-abuse in smart homes and focus on their potentials and
shortcomings. Unsurprisingly, we find that many recommendations conflict with
each other due to a lack of understanding of phases of abuse in smart homes.
Desirable properties to design abuse-resistant smart home devices are proposed
for all the phases of abuse. The research community benefits from our analysis
and recommendations to move forward with a focus on filling the blind spots of
existing smart home devices' safety measures and building appropriate safety
measures that consider tech-abuse threats in smart homes.

specifically, for each countable group $\Gamma$ we introduce the $\Gamma$-jump.
We study the elementary properties of the $\Gamma$-jumps and compare them with
other previously studied jump operators. One of our main results is to
establish that for many groups $\Gamma$, the $\Gamma$-jump is \emph{proper} in
the sense that for any Borel equivalence relation $E$ the $\Gamma$-jump of $E$
is strictly higher than $E$ in the Borel reducibility hierarchy. On the other
hand there are examples of groups $\Gamma$ for which the $\Gamma$-jump is not
proper. To establish properness, we produce an analysis of Borel equivalence
relations induced by continuous actions of the automorphism group of what we
denote the full $\Gamma$-tree, and relate these to iterates of the
$\Gamma$-jump. We also produce several new examples of equivalence relations
that arise from applying the $\Gamma$-jump to classically studied equivalence
relations and derive generic ergodicity results related to these. We apply our
results to show that the complexity of the isomorphism problem for countable
scattered linear orders properly increases with the rank.

significant application-relevant categories can be picked and merged form

in this case, due to inconsistent object annotations. Consider an object
category like faces that is annotated in one dataset, but is not annotated in
another dataset, although the object itself appears in the latter images. Some
categories, like face here, would thus be considered foreground in one dataset,

carefully integrate partial but correct annotations with complementary but

evaluations of internal and external validity. While randomized clinical trials
can overcome several threats to internal validity, they may be prone to poor
external validity. Conversely, large prospective observational studies sampled
from a broadly generalizable population may be externally valid, yet
susceptible to threats to internal validity, particularly confounding. Thus,
methods that address confounding and enhance transportability of study results
across populations are essential for internally and externally valid causal
inference, respectively. These issues persist for another problem closely
related to transportability known as data-fusion. We develop a calibration
method to generate balancing weights that address confounding and sampling
bias, thereby enabling valid estimation of the target population average
treatment effect. We compare the calibration approach to two additional
doubly-robust methods that estimate the effect of an intervention on an outcome
within a second, possibly unrelated target population. The proposed
methodologies can be extended to resolve data-fusion problems that seek to
evaluate the effects of an intervention using data from two related studies
sampled from different populations. A simulation study is conducted to
demonstrate the advantages and similarities of the different techniques. We
also test the performance of the calibration approach in a motivating real data
example comparing whether the effect of biguanides versus sulfonylureas - the
two most common oral diabetes medication classes for initial treatment - on
all-cause mortality described in a historical cohort applies to a contemporary

procedures in problems of recovering functions and densities. These methods
often rely on somewhat arbitrary and restrictive assumptions such as isotropy

Bayesian forests (including BART) under substantially relaxed smoothness
assumptions. In particular, we provide a comprehensive study of asymptotic
optimality and posterior contraction of Bayesian forests when the regression
function has anisotropic smoothness that possibly varies over the function
domain. The regression function can also be possibly discontinuous. We
introduce a new class of sparse {\em piecewise heterogeneous anisotropic}
H\""{o}lder functions and derive their minimax lower bound of estimation in
high-dimensional scenarios under the $L_2$-loss. Next, we find that the default
Bayesian tree priors, coupled with a Dirichlet subset selection prior for
sparse estimation in high-dimensional scenarios, adapt to unknown heterogeneous
smoothness, discontinuity, and sparsity. These results show that Bayesian
forests are uniquely suited for more general estimation problems which would
render other default machine learning tools, such as Gaussian processes,
suboptimal. Our numerical study shows that Bayesian forests outperform other
competitors such as random forests and deep neural networks, which are believed
to work well for discontinuous or complicated smooth functions. Beyond
nonparametric regression, we also show that Bayesian forests can be
successfully applied to many other problems including density estimation and
binary classification.

primitives for encrypted databases (such as oblivious protocols), that hide the

However, recent work has shown that even volume leakage can enable the
reconstruction of entire columns in the database. Yet, existing attacks rely on
a set of assumptions that are unrealistic in practice: for example, they (i)
require a large number of queries to be issued by the user, or (ii) assume
certain distributions on the queries or underlying data (e.g., that the queries
are distributed uniformly at random, or that the database does not contain
missing values).
  In this work, we present new attacks for recovering the content of individual
user queries, assuming no leakage from the system except the number of results
and avoiding the limiting assumptions above. Unlike prior attacks, our attacks
require only a single query to be issued by the user for recovering the
keyword. Furthermore, our attacks make no assumptions about the distribution of
issued queries or the underlying data. Instead, our key insight is to exploit
the behavior of real-world applications.
  We start by surveying 11 applications to identify two key characteristics
that can be exploited by attackers: (i) file injection, and (ii) automatic
query replay. We present attacks that leverage these two properties in concert
with volume leakage, independent of the details of any encrypted database
system. Subsequently, we perform an attack on the real Gmail web client by
simulating a server-side adversary. Our attack on Gmail completes within a

when testing data are slightly perturbed. Existing theoretical studies of
adversarial training algorithms mostly focus on either adversarial training
losses or local convergence properties. In contrast, this paper studies the
generalization performance of a generic adversarial training algorithm.
Specifically, we consider linear regression models and two-layer neural
networks (with lazy training) using squared loss under low-dimensional and
high-dimensional regimes. In the former regime, after overcoming the
non-smoothness of adversarial training, the adversarial risk of the trained
models can converge to the minimal adversarial risk. In the latter regime, we
discover that data interpolation prevents the adversarially robust estimator
from being consistent. Therefore, inspired by successes of the least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we incorporate the L1 penalty in the
high dimensional adversarial learning and show that it leads to consistent
adversarially robust estimation. A series of numerical studies are conducted to
demonstrate how the smoothness and L1 penalization help improve the adversarial
robustness of DNN models.

Most current solutions require paired image datasets that include both hazy
images and their corresponding haze-free ground-truth images. However, in
reality, lighting conditions and other factors can produce a range of haze-free
images that can serve as ground truth for a hazy image, and a single ground
truth image cannot capture that range. This limits the scalability and
practicality of paired image datasets in real-world applications. In this
paper, we focus on unpaired single image de-hazing and we do not rely on the
ground truth image or physical scattering model. We reduce the image de-hazing
problem to an image-to-image translation problem and propose a dehazing
Global-Local Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network (Dehaze-GLCGAN).
Generator network of Dehaze-GLCGAN combines an encoder-decoder architecture
with residual blocks to better recover the haze free scene. We also employ a
global-local discriminator structure to deal with spatially varying haze.
Through ablation study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of different factors
in the performance of the proposed network. Our extensive experiments over
three benchmark datasets show that our network outperforms previous work in
terms of PSNR and SSIM while being trained on smaller amount of data compared

global operator over a directed and unbalanced multi-agent network, where the
global operator is quasinonexpansive and only partially accessible to each
individual agent. Two cases are addressed, that is, the global operator is sum
separable and block separable. For this first case, the global operator is the
sum of local operators, which are assumed to be Lipschitz, and each local
operator is privately known to each individual agent. To deal with this
scenario, a distributed (or decentralized) algorithm, called Distributed
quasi-averaged Operator Tracking algorithm (DOT), is proposed and rigorously
analyzed, and it is shown that the algorithm can converge to a fixed point of
the global operator at a linear rate under a linear regularity condition, which
is strictly weaker than the strong convexity assumption on cost functions in
existing convex optimization literature. For the second scenario, the global
operator is composed of a group of local block operators which are Lipschitz
and can be accessed only by each individual agent. In this setup, a distributed
algorithm, called Distributed quasiaveraged Operator Playing algorithm (DOP),
is developed and shown to be linearly convergent to a fixed point of the global
operator under the linear regularity condition. The above studied problems
provide a unified framework for many interesting problems. As examples, the
proposed DOT and DOP are exploited to deal with distributed optimization and
multi-player games under partial-decision information. Finally, numerical
examples are presented to corroborate the theoretical results.

For
example, in symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, the bulk energy gap
localizes edge modes near the boundary. In this work we identify a new
mechanism that leads to topological phases which are not only gapless but where
the absence of a gap is essential. These `intrinsically gapless SPT phases'
have no gapped counterpart and are hence also distinct from recently discovered
examples of gapless SPT phases. The essential ingredient of these phases is
that on-site symmetries act in an anomalous fashion at low energies.
Intrinsically gapless SPT phases are found to display several unique properties
including (i) protected edge modes that are impossible to realize in a gapped
system with the same symmetries, (ii) string order parameters that are likewise
forbidden in gapped phases, and (iii) constraints on the phase diagram obtained
upon perturbing the phase. We verify predictions of the general theory in a

surfaces by magnifying the resolution of the Lipkin-Nogami equations and
strengthening the Strutinsky procedure, thus reducing spurious effects from the
continuum. We further present a novel deterministic method for calculating
fission dynamics under the assumption of strongly damped nucleonic motion. Our
technique directly determines the evolution of the scissioned shape
distribution according to the number of random walk steps rather than the
statistical accumulation of fission events. We show that our new technique is
equivalent to the Metropolis random walk pioneered over the past decade by
Randrup and colleagues. It further improves upon it, as we remove the need for
altering the nuclear landscape via a biased potential. With our final
improvement, we calculate fission fragments mass and charge distributions using
particle number projection, which affords the simultaneous calculation of both
mass and charge yield distributions. Fission fragments are thus calculated from
the quantum mechanical $A$-body states of the potential energy surface rather
than the collective mass asymmetry variable ($\alpha_{\rm g}$) of the
Finite-Range Liquid-Drop Model (FRLDM) used in past work. We highlight the

  Feasibility and Optimal Pool Size Selection with Dilution Effects",,,,,"q-bio.PE math.OC stat.ME","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Repeated asymptomatic screening for SARS-CoV-2 promises to control spread of
the virus but would require too many resources to implement at scale. Group
testing is promising for screening more people with fewer test resources:
multiple samples tested together in one pool can be excluded with one negative
test result. Existing approaches to group testing design for SARS-CoV-2
asymptomatic screening, however, do not consider dilution effects: that false
negatives become more common with larger pools. As a consequence, they may
recommend pool sizes that are too large or misestimate the benefits of
screening. Modeling dilution effects, we derive closed-form expressions for the
expected number of tests and false negative/positives per person screened under
two popular group testing methods: the linear and square array methods. We find
that test error correlation induced by a common viral load across an
individual's samples results in many fewer false negatives than would be
expected from less realistic but more widely assumed independent errors. This
insight also suggests that false positives can be controlled through repeated
tests without significantly increasing false negatives. Using these closed-form
expressions to trace a Pareto frontier over error rates and tests, we design
testing protocols for repeated asymptomatic screening of a large population. We
minimize disease prevalence by optimizing a time-varying pool sizes and
screening frequency constrained by daily test capacity and a false positive
limit. This provides a testing protocol practitioners can use for mitigating
COVID-19. In a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this methodology
in controlling spread.

model coordinated with the EV's responses to the incentive is formulated to
determine the days to activate the aggregation program and the optimal
incentives that are broadcasted to the EV owners in the first stage. Given the
determined incentives and EV's responses, an real-time (RT) optimal bidding
algorithm complying with EVs' energy demand in the second stage is designed to
maximize the aggregator's profits in the markets. The proposed models are
tested using the data collected from PJM's energy and regulation markets. The
results show the incentive-based aggregator can benefit both the EV owners and
the aggregator from the credits obtained from the markets. Meanwhile, the
results also indicate the proposed optimal bidding algorithm is capable of
handling the uncertainty of regulation signals and following the signals with
high precision.

explosions are the sites of active cosmic-ray production. Based on the
predictions of nonlinear diffusive shock acceleration theory, we model the
cosmic-ray proton (CRP) production by both pre-SN stellar winds (SWs) and
supernova remnants (SNRs) from core-collapse SNe inside the starburst nucleus.
Adopting different models for the transport of CRPs, we estimate the
$\gamma$-ray and neutrino emissions due to $pp$ collisions from nearby SBGs
such as M82, NGC253, and Arp220. We find that with the current $\gamma$-rays
observations by Fermi-LAT, Veritas, and H.E.S.S., it would be difficult to
constrain CRP production and transport models. Yet, the observations are better
reproduced with (1) the combination of the single power-law (PL) momentum
distribution for SNR-produced CRPs and the diffusion model in which the CRP
diffusion is mediated by the strong Kolmogorov-type turbulence of $\delta
B/B\sim1$, and (2) the combination of the double PL model for SNR-produced CRPs
and the diffusion model in which the scattering of CRPs is controlled mostly by
self-excited waves rather than the pre-existing turbulence. The contribution of
SW-produced CRPs could be substantial in Arp220, where the star formation rate
is higher and the slope of the initial mass function would be flatter. We
suggest that M82 and NGC253 might be detectable as point sources of high-energy
neutrinos in the upcoming KM3NET and IceCube-Gen2, when optimistic models are
applied. Future observations of neutrinos as well as $\gamma$-rays would
provide constraints for the production and diffusion of CRPs in SBGs.

astonishingly realistic-seeming images and audio, but quantitative evaluation
remains a challenge. Log-likelihood is an appealing metric due to its grounding
in statistics and information theory, but it can be challenging to estimate for
implicit generative models, and scalar-valued metrics give an incomplete
picture of a model's quality. In this work, we propose to use rate distortion
(RD) curves to evaluate and compare deep generative models. While estimating RD
curves is seemingly even more computationally demanding than log-likelihood
estimation, we show that we can approximate the entire RD curve using nearly
the same computations as were previously used to achieve a single
log-likelihood estimate. We evaluate lossy compression rates of VAEs, GANs, and
adversarial autoencoders (AAEs) on the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets. Measuring
the entire RD curve gives a more complete picture than scalar-valued metrics,
and we arrive at a number of insights not obtainable from log-likelihoods
alone.

frameworks have been developed to tackle the problem of real-time object
detection from RGB images. Ordinary object detection approaches process
information from the images only, and they are oblivious to the camera pose
with regard to the environment and the scale of the environment. On the other
hand, mobile Augmented Reality (AR) frameworks can continuously track a
camera's pose within the scene and can estimate the correct scale of the
environment by using Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO). In this paper, we propose
a novel approach that combines the geometric information from VIO with semantic
information from object detectors to improve the performance of object
detection on mobile devices. Our approach includes three components: (1) an
image orientation correction method, (2) a scale-based filtering approach, and
(3) an online semantic map. Each component takes advantage of the different
characteristics of the VIO-based AR framework. We implemented the AR-enhanced
features using ARCore and the SSD Mobilenet model on Android phones. To
validate our approach, we manually labeled objects in image sequences taken
from 12 room-scale AR sessions. The results show that our approach can improve

thermalization and non-equilibrium dynamics is monitored in real-time. We find
that, in the strong coupling regime, instant heat flux counterintuitively

spontaneously above the critical point during the thermal energy transfer
process. The universal bound on the precision of nonequilibrium steady-state

`turbulent' free shear layer is analyzed using vortex-gas simulations that
condense all dynamics into the kinematics of the Biot-Savart relation. The
initial evolution of perturbations in a constant-vorticity layer is found to be
in accurate agreement with the linear stability theory of Rayleigh. There is
then a stage of non-universal evolution of coherent structures that is closely
approximated not by Rayleigh stability theory, but by the Karman-Rubach-Lamb
linear instability of monopoles, until the neighboring coherent structures
merge. After several mergers, the layer evolves eventually to a self-preserving
reverse cascade, characterized by a universal spread rate found by
Suryanarayanan et al. (Phys.Rev.E 89, 013009, 2014) and a universal value of
the ratio of dominant spacing of structures ($\Lambda_f$) to the layer
thickness ($\delta_\omega$). In this universal, self-preserving state, the
local amplification of perturbation amplitudes is accurately predicted by
Rayleigh theory for the locally existing `base' flow. The model of Morris et
al. (Proc.Roy.Soc. A 431, 219-243, 1990.), which computes the growth of the
layer by balancing the energy lost by the mean flow with the energy gain of the
perturbation modes (computed from an application of Rayleigh theory), is shown,
however, to provide a non-universal asymptotic state with initial condition
dependent spread-rate and spectra. The reason is that the predictions of the
Rayleigh instability, for a flow regime with coherent structures, are valid
only at the special value of $\Lambda_f/\delta_\omega$ achieved in the
universal self-preserving state.

mobile-friendly. Although mobile devices have become the primary means of
accessing information on the web, many existing visualizations are not
optimized for small screens and can lead to a frustrating user experience.
Currently, practitioners and researchers have to engage in a tedious and
time-consuming process to ensure that their designs scale to screens of
different sizes, and existing toolkits and libraries provide little support in
diagnosing and repairing issues. To address this challenge, MobileVisFixer
automates a mobile-friendly visualization re-design process with a novel
reinforcement learning framework. To inform the design of MobileVisFixer, we
first collected and analyzed SVG-based visualizations on the web, and
identified five common mobile-friendly issues. MobileVisFixer addresses four of
these issues on single-view Cartesian visualizations with linear or discrete
scales by a Markov Decision Process model that is both generalizable across
various visualizations and fully explainable. MobileVisFixer deconstructs
charts into declarative formats, and uses a greedy heuristic based on Policy
Gradient methods to find solutions to this difficult, multi-criteria
optimization problem in reasonable time. In addition, MobileVisFixer can be
easily extended with the incorporation of optimization algorithms for data
visualizations. Quantitative evaluation on two real-world datasets demonstrates
the effectiveness and generalizability of our method.

teleoperation systems consisting continuous time master, slave, operator, and
environment with discrete time controllers over general communication networks.
The output signals of the slave and master robots are quantized with stochastic
sampling periods which are modeled as being from a finite set. By applying an
input delay method, the probabilistic sampling system is converted into a
continuous-time system including stochastic parameters in the system matrices.
The main contribution of this paper is the derivation of the less conservative
stability conditions for linear discrete teleoperation systems taking into
account the challenges such as the stochastic sampling rate, constant time
delay and the possibility of data packet dropout. The numbers of dropouts are
driven by a finite state Markov chain. First, the problem of finding a lower
bound on the maximum sampling period that preserves the stability is
formulated. This problem is constructed as a convex optimization program in
terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Next, Lyapunov Krasovskii based
approaches are applied to propose sufficient conditions for stochastic and
exponential stability of closed-loop sampled-data bilateral teleoperation
system. The proposed criterion notifies the effect of sampling time on the
stability transparency trade-off and imposes bounds on the sampling time,
control gains and the damping of robots. Neglecting this study undermines both
the stability and transparency of teleoperation systems. Numerical simulation
results are used to verify the proposed stability criteria and illustrate the
effectiveness of the sampling architecture.

Varieties of control schemes have been proposed for these systems and major

Recently, unreliable communication networks affected by packet loss and
variable transmission delays have been received much attention. Thus, it is
worth considering discrete-time theories for bilateral teleoperation
architectures, which are formulated on the same lines as the continuous-time
systems. Despite the extensive amount of researches concerning continuous-time

approach to declarative problem solving. This is arguably due to its attractive
modeling-grounding-solving workflow that provides an easy approach to problem
solving, even for laypersons outside computer science. Unlike this, the high
degree of sophistication of the underlying technology makes it increasingly
hard for ASP experts to put ideas into practice.
  For addressing this issue, this tutorial aims at enabling users to build
their own ASP-based systems. More precisely, we show how the ASP system CLINGO
can be used for extending ASP and for implementing customized special-purpose
systems. To this end, we propose two alternatives. We begin with a traditional
AI technique and show how meta programming can be used for extending ASP. This
is a rather light approach that relies on CLINGO's reification feature to use
ASP itself for expressing new functionalities. Unlike this, the major part of
this tutorial uses traditional programming (in PYTHON) for manipulating CLINGO
via its application programming interface. This approach allows for changing
and controlling the entire model-ground-solve workflow of ASP. Central to this
is CLINGO's new Application class that allows us to draw on CLINGO's
infrastructure by customizing processes similar to the one in CLINGO. For
instance, we may engage manipulations to programs' abstract syntax trees,
control various forms of multi-shot solving, and set up theory propagators for
foreign inferences. Another cross-sectional structure, spanning meta as well as
application programming, is CLINGO's intermediate format, ASPIF, that specifies
the interface among the underlying grounder and solver. We illustrate the
aforementioned concepts and techniques throughout this tutorial by means of
examples and several non-trivial case-studies.

  Approach for Naturalistic Driving",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Autonomous Braking and Throttle control is key in developing safe driving
systems for the future. There exists a need for autonomous vehicles to
negotiate a multi-agent environment while ensuring safety and comfort. A Deep
Reinforcement Learning based autonomous throttle and braking system is
presented. For each time step, the proposed system makes a decision to apply
the brake or throttle. The throttle and brake are modelled as continuous action
space values. We demonstrate 2 scenarios where there is a need for a
sophisticated braking and throttle system, i.e when there is a static obstacle
in front of our agent like a car, stop sign. The second scenario consists of 2
vehicles approaching an intersection. The policies for brake and throttle
control are learned through computer simulation using Deep deterministic policy
gradients. The experiment shows that the system not only avoids a collision,
but also it ensures that there is smooth change in the values of throttle/brake
as it gets out of the emergency situation and abides by the speed regulations,
i.e the system resembles human driving.

  on fan-beam CT","26 pages, 12 figures",,"10.3934/ipi.2022029",,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The recent development of energy-resolving scintillation crystals opens the
way to new types of applications and imaging systems. In the context of
computerized tomography (CT), it enables to use the energy as a dimension of
information supplementing the source and detector positions. It is then crucial
to relate the energy measurements to the properties of Compton scattering, the
dominant interaction between photons and matter. An appropriate model of the
spectral data leads to the concept of Compton scattering tomography (CST).
Multiple-order scattering constitutes the major difficulty of CST. It is, in
general, impossible to know how many times a photon was scattered before being
measured. In the literature, this nature of the spectral data has often been
eluded by considering only the first-order scattering in models of the spectral
data. This consideration, however, does not represent the reality as second-
and higher-order scattering are a substantial part of the spectral measurement.
In this work, we propose to tackle this difficulty by an analysis of the
spectral data in terms of modeling and mapping properties. Due to the
complexity of the multiple order scattering, we model and study the
second-order scattering and extend the results to the higher orders by
conjecture. The study ends up with a general reconstruction strategy based on
the variations of the spectral data which is illustrated by simulations on a
joint CST-CT fan beam scanner. We further show how the method can be extended
to high energetic polychromatic radiation sources.

simpler and easy-to-visualize representations of the data that preserve its
essential properties. A widely-used method to preserve the underlying
hierarchical structure of the data while reducing its complexity is to find an
embedding of the data into a tree or an ultrametric. The most popular
algorithms for this task are the classic linkage algorithms (single, average,
or complete). However, these methods on a data set of $n$ points in
$\Omega(\log n)$ dimensions exhibit a quite prohibitive running time of
$\Theta(n^2)$.
  In this paper, we provide a new algorithm which takes as input a set of
points $P$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, and for every $c\ge 1$, runs in time
$n^{1+\frac{\rho}{c^2}}$ (for some universal constant $\rho>1$) to output an
ultrametric $\Delta$ such that for any two points $u,v$ in $P$, we have
$\Delta(u,v)$ is within a multiplicative factor of $5c$ to the distance between
$u$ and $v$ in the ""best"" ultrametric representation of $P$. Here, the best
ultrametric is the ultrametric $\tilde\Delta$ that minimizes the maximum
distance distortion with respect to the $\ell_2$ distance, namely that
minimizes $\underset{u,v \in P}{\max}\ \frac{\tilde\Delta(u,v)}{\|u-v\|_2}$.
  We complement the above result by showing that under popular complexity
theoretic assumptions, for every constant $\varepsilon>0$, no algorithm with
running time $n^{2-\varepsilon}$ can distinguish between inputs in
$\ell_\infty$-metric that admit isometric embedding and those that incur a
distortion of $\frac{3}{2}$.
  Finally, we present empirical evaluation on classic machine learning datasets
and show that the output of our algorithm is comparable to the output of the
linkage algorithms while achieving a much faster running time.

contain important entangled resources like Dicke states as well as some other
sub-radiant states that are difficult to prepare. Leveraging on the symmetry of
these states we consider uniform pairwise exchange coupling between every pair
of qubits. Starting from a product state of a given spin eigenstate with a
single qubit state, another spin eigenstate can be prepared using simple time
evolutions. This expansion paves a deterministic approach to prepare arbitrary
Dicke states in linear steps. We discuss an improvement in this cost building
up on a previous work for W states deterministic preparation in logarithmic
circuit depth. The modified algorithm requires several iterations of pumping
spin angular momentum into the system and is akin to the amplitude
amplification in Grover search. As a use case to demonstrate the proposed
scheme, we choose a system of non-interacting static spin qubits connected to a
ferromagnetic reservoir. The flying qubits emerging from the reservoir locally
interact with static qubits successively, mediating an in-direct exchange
interaction between all the pairs.

the same time achieving extreme reliability comes with the cost which include
but not limited to slow pace of new feature deployments, operations cost and
opportunity cost. One such earlier effort in giving an objective metric to
strike the fine balance between acceptable reliability and product velocity is
error budget and its associated policy. There are also contemporary deployment
guidelines and controls per organization to ascertain the reliability of an
application deployment version into customer facing or production environments.
This work proposes new objective metrics called Application Deployment Score
estimated using dichotomous Item Response Theory model. This score is used to
assess the improvement trend of each application version deployed into customer
facing environment, identify the improvement scope for each application
deployment in each area of deployment guidelines and controls, adjust the error
budget i.e. soft error budget of a interdependent application in application
mesh by giving soft collective responsibility and finally defines a new metric
called deployment index which helps to assess the effectiveness of these
contemporary deployment guidelines and controls in upholding the agreed SLOs of
the application in customer facing environments. This study opens a new field
of research in developing new underlying latent indexes (i.e. new objective
metrics) in SRE and DevOps space.

design primarily due to their computational costs being independent of the

very well suited for high-fidelity simulation based aerodynamic shape
optimization of highly parametrized geometries such as aircraft wings. However,
the development of adjoint-based solvers involve careful mathematical treatment
and their implementation require detailed software development. Furthermore,
they can become prohibitively expensive when multiple optimization problems are
being solved, each requiring multiple restarts to circumvent local optima. In
this work, we propose a machine learning enabled, surrogate-based framework
that replaces the expensive adjoint solver, without compromising on predicting
predictive accuracy. Specifically, we first train a deep neural network (DNN)
from training data generated from evaluating the high-fidelity simulation model
on a model-agnostic, design of experiments on the geometry shape parameters.
The optimum shape may then be computed by using a gradient-based optimizer
coupled with the trained DNN. Subsequently, we also perform a gradient-free
Bayesian optimization, where the trained DNN is used as the prior mean. We
observe that the latter framework (DNN-BO) improves upon the DNN-only based
optimization strategy for the same computational cost. Overall, this framework
predicts the true optimum with very high accuracy, while requiring far fewer
high-fidelity function calls compared to the adjoint-based method. Furthermore,
we show that multiple optimization problems can be solved with the same machine

reinforcement learning. This paper studies the use of TD(0), a canonical TD
algorithm, to estimate the value function of a given policy from a batch of
data. In this batch setting, we show that TD(0) may converge to an inaccurate
value function because the update following an action is weighted according to
the number of times that action occurred in the batch -- not the true
probability of the action under the given policy. To address this limitation,
we introduce \textit{policy sampling error corrected}-TD(0) (PSEC-TD(0)).
PSEC-TD(0) first estimates the empirical distribution of actions in each state
in the batch and then uses importance sampling to correct for the mismatch
between the empirical weighting and the correct weighting for updates following
each action. We refine the concept of a certainty-equivalence estimate and
argue that PSEC-TD(0) is a more data efficient estimator than TD(0) for a fixed
batch of data. Finally, we conduct an empirical evaluation of PSEC-TD(0) on
three batch value function learning tasks, with a hyperparameter sensitivity
analysis, and show that PSEC-TD(0) produces value function estimates with lower
mean squared error than TD(0).

of a preconcentrated biomolecule plug by activating the CP for predetermined
on/off intervals. This work demonstrated the feasibility of the cyclic CP
actuation and optimized the sweeping conditions required to obtain maximum
retention time of a preconcentrated plug over a desired sensing region and
enhanced detection sensitivity. The ability of this method to efficiently
preconcentrate different analytes and to successfully increase immunoassay

we address a recently proposed objective-invariant definition of entanglement
understood as the actual and potential coding of effective and intensive

how this new objective definition of entanglement is able to escape both

that, unlike with the orthodox definitions, this new objective-relational

(SCBF) equations subjected to multiplicative pure jump noise in bounded or

unique strong solution satisfying the energy equality (It\^o's formula) to the
SCBF equations. We resolve the issue of the global solvability of SCBF
equations, by using a monotonicity property of the linear and nonlinear
operators and a stochastic generalization of the Minty-Browder technique. The
major difficulty is that an It\^o's formula in infinite dimensions is not
available for such systems. This difficulty is overcame by approximating the
solution using approximate functions composing of the elements of eigenspaces
of the Stokes operator in such a way that the approximations are bounded and
converge in both Sobolev and Lebesgue spaces simultaneously. Due to technical
difficulties, we discuss about the global in time regularity results of such
strong solutions in periodic domains only. Once the system is well-posed, we
look for the asymptotic behavior of strong solutions. The exponential stability
results (in mean square and pathwise sense) for the stationary solutions is
established in this work for large effective viscosity. Moreover, a
stabilization result of the SCBF equations by using a multiplicative pure jump
noise is also obtained. Finally, we prove the existence of a unique ergodic and
strongly mixing invariant measure for the SCBF equations subject to

registration network, which can jointly estimate forward and backward dense
displacement fields (DDFs). Additionally, an invertible constraint is employed

For label fusion, we adapt a few-shot learning network to measure the
similarity of atlas and target patches. Moreover, the network can be seamlessly

  Sensor for SARS-CoV-2 Detection",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.ins-det physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper, we propose a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) structure based
on Kretschmann configuration incorporating layers of Silicon and BaTiO$_3$ on
top of Ag for real-time detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using thiol tethered DNA as a ligand. Extensive
numerical analysis based on transfer matrix theory as well as finite-difference
time-domain (FDTD) technique has been performed to characterize the sensor
response considering sensitivity, full width at half maxima, and minimum
reflection. About 7.6 times enhanced sensitivity has been obtained using the
proposed architecture for SARS-CoV-2 detection, compared to the basic
Kretschmann configuration. Notably, the structure provides consistent
enhancement over other competitive SPR structures for both angular and
wavelength interrogations with a figure-of-merit of 692.28. Additionally, we
repeated simulations for various ligate-ligand pairs to assess the range of
applicability and robust performance improvement has been observed. As a
result, the proposed sensor design provides a suitable configuration for highly
sensitive, rapid, non-invasive biosensing which can be useful if adopted in
experimental sensing protocols.

with all the unknown parameters and dynamic uncertainties lumped into
disturbance. Using adaptive robust extended Kalman filter(AREKF) the movement
and velocity of each joint is predicted to use in discontinuous Lyapunov-based
controller structure. The parameters of the error dynamics have been validated
off-line by real data. Computer simulation results given for a two degree of

comparing the performance of EKF and improved AREKF. Although it is shown that
accurate trajectory tracking can be achieved by using the proposed controller.

flexibility of our model for predicting the epidemic progress and its moment
behavior. The model has shown that the reopening plans and governmental
measures directly affect the number of active cases of the disease. Also, it
has specified that even releasing a small portion of the population (about 2-3
percent) can lead to a severe increase in active patients and consequently
multiple waves in the disease progress. The effects of the healthcare
capacities of the country have been obtained (quantitatively), which clearly
specify the importance of this context. Control strategies including strict

detection based on convolution neural networks (CNN), smart wearable and

surveillance cameras feed continuous video stream to the server where we detect
the inter-object distance to identify any social distancing violations. A
violation activates area-based monitoring of active smartphone users and their
current state of illness. In case a confirmed patient or a person with high

appropriate measures are put into actions. We evaluated the proposed scheme for
social distancing violation detection using YOLO (you only look once) v2 and

starting point of the formulation is the representations of the relativity

contractions -- a natural way in which one can understand how the Newtonian
theory arises as an approximation to Einstein's theory. We begin with the
Poincar\'{e} symmetry underlying special relativity and the nature of Minkowski
spacetime as a coset representation space of the algebra and the group. Then,
we proceed to the parallel for the phase space of a spin zero particle, in
relation to which we present the full scheme for its dynamics under the
Hamiltonian formulation, illustrating that as essentially the symmetry feature
of the phase space geometry. Lastly, the reduction of all that to the Newtonian
theory as an approximation with its space-time, phase space, and dynamics under
the appropriate relativity symmetry contraction is presented. While all notions
involved are well established, the systematic presentation of that story as one
coherent picture fills a gap in the literature on the subject matter.
