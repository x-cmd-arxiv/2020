paper, where we propose a novel computer vision based technique called
\textbf{ShopLook} to address the challenging problem of recommending similar
fashion products. The proposed method has been evaluated at Myntra
(www.myntra.com), a leading online fashion e-commerce platform. In particular,
given a user query and the corresponding Product Display Page (PDP) against the
query, the goal of our method is to recommend similar fashion products
corresponding to the entire set of fashion articles worn by a model in the PDP
full-shot image (the one showing the entire model from head to toe). The
novelty and strength of our method lies in its capability to recommend similar
articles for all the fashion items worn by the model, in addition to the
primary article corresponding to the query. This is not only important to
promote cross-sells for boosting revenue, but also for improving customer
experience and engagement. In addition, our approach is also capable of
recommending similar products for User Generated Content (UGC), eg., fashion
article images uploaded by users. Formally, our proposed method consists of the
following components (in the same order): i) Human keypoint detection, ii) Pose
classification, iii) Article localisation and object detection, along with
active learning feedback, and iv) Triplet network based image embedding model.

linear spin wave theory. Although the interlayer coupling can be ferromagnetic
or antiferromagnetic, we keep the intralayer one ferromagnetic to avoid
possible frustration. For the interlayer ferromagnetic case, we find the magnon
bands have similar features with the corresponding electronic energy spectrums.
Although the linear dispersions near the Dirac points are preserved in the
magnon bands of twisted bilayer magnets, their slopes are graduately reduced
with the decrease of the twist angles. On the other hand, the interlayer
antiferromagnetic couplings generate quite different magnon spectra. The two
single-layered magnon spectra are usually undecoupled due to the opposite
orientations of the spins in the two layers. We also develop a low-energy
continuous theory for very small twist angles, which has been verified to fit
well with the exact tight-binding calculations. Our results may be
experimentally observed due to the rapid progress in two-dimensional magnetic
materials.

Neumann architectures and is highly interesting for robot control. However,
despite the high speed and energy efficiency of neuromorphic computing,
algorithms utilizing this hardware in control scenarios are still rare. One
problem is the transition from fast spiking activity on the hardware, which
acts on a timescale of a few milliseconds, to a control-relevant timescale on
the order of hundreds of milliseconds. Another problem is the execution of
complex trajectories, which requires spiking activity to contain sufficient
variability, while at the same time, for reliable performance, network dynamics
must be adequately robust against noise. In this study we exploit a recently
developed biologically-inspired spiking neural network model, the so-called
anisotropic network. We identified and transferred the core principles of the
anisotropic network to neuromorphic hardware using Intel's neuromorphic
research chip Loihi and validated the system on trajectories from a
motor-control task performed by a robot arm. We developed a network
architecture including the anisotropic network and a pooling layer which allows
fast spike read-out from the chip and performs an inherent regularization. With
this, we show that the anisotropic network on Loihi reliably encodes sequential
patterns of neural activity, each representing a robotic action, and that the
patterns allow the generation of multidimensional trajectories on
control-relevant timescales. Taken together, our study presents a new algorithm
that allows the generation of complex robotic movements as a building block for
robotic control using state of the art neuromorphic hardware.

this. Here, we report the phase diagram in magnetic field, applied along both
the easy $a$-axis and hard $b$-axis. For field aligned to the $b$-axis, we find
that the magnetic transition temperatures are suppressed and at low temperature
there is a single modulated fan state, separating an easy $a$-axis
ferromagnetic state from a field polarised state. This fan state is well
explained with the QOBD theory in the presence of anisotropy and field.
Experimental evidence supporting the QOBD explanation is provided by the large
increase in the $T^2$ coefficient of the resistivity and direct detection of
enhanced magnetic fluctuations with inelastic neutron scattering, across the

explain field induced modulated states that persist to very low temperature.

areas can be leveraged as auxiliary information, enriching discriminative clues
for geolocalization. Specifically, we introduce a simple and effective deep

contextual information in an end-to-end manner. Without using extra part

the attention according to the distance to the image center. It eases the part
matching and enables the part-wise representation learning. Owing to the
square-ring partition design, the proposed LPN has good scalability to rotation
variations and achieves competitive results on three prevailing benchmarks,
i.e., University-1652, CVUSA and CVACT. Besides, we also show the proposed LPN
can be easily embedded into other frameworks to further boost performance.

for inferring slow changes in biophysical parameters that control fluctuations
of fast neuronal states. The application domain we have in mind is inferring
slow changes in variables (e.g., extracellular ion concentrations or synaptic
efficacy) that underlie phase transitions in brain activity (e.g., paroxysmal
seizure activity). The scheme is efficient and yet retains a biophysical
interpretation, in virtue of being based on established neural mass models that
are equipped with a slow dynamic on the parameters (such as synaptic rate
constants or effective connectivity). In brief, we use an adiabatic
approximation to summarise fast fluctuations in hidden neuronal states (and
their expression in sensors) in terms of their second order statistics; namely,
their complex cross spectra. This allows one to specify and compare models of
slowly changing parameters (using Bayesian model reduction) that generate a
sequence of empirical cross spectra of electrophysiological recordings.
Crucially, we use the slow fluctuations in the spectral power of neuronal
activity as empirical priors on changes in synaptic parameters. This introduces
a circular causality, in which synaptic parameters underwrite fast neuronal
activity that, in turn, induces activity-dependent plasticity in synaptic
parameters. In this foundational paper, we describe the underlying model,
establish its face validity using simulations and provide an illustrative
application to a chemoconvulsant animal model of seizure activity.

semi-analytical model, we combine two separate analytical models into a new one
to treat the restricted four-body problem. We apply this new Combined
Analytical Model (CAM) to different synthetic systems and systematically map
the occurrence of secular resonances (SR). These maps are then visualized as
two-dimensional sections of the parameter space. The CAM model has a median
error below 3% relative to numerical reference simulations. We also derive a
simplified CAM that performs well for hierarchical systems with moderate to
large separations between the bodies. Our results show that SR appear in the HZ
even for large secondary star distances (up to >1000 au) if either (i) the
planet's distance is larger than Jupiter's, or (ii) its mass is about Saturn's

galactic tides can push a formerly dynamically quiet HZ to a high-eccentricity
state. Based on these results we provide the easy-to-use online tool ""SHaDoS""

studied and new applications in quenched QED and Yukawa theories are
introduced. Chord diagrams appear in quantum field theory in the context of
Dyson-Schwinger equations, where, according to recent results, they are used to
express the solutions. In another direction, we study the action of point field

attributes of an apparel (eg, neck type, dress length, collar type) on their
product detail pages. However, customers usually prefer to buy apparel based on
their style information, or simply put, occasion (eg, party/ sports/ casual
wear). Application of a supervised image-captioning model to generate
style-based image captions is limited because obtaining ground-truth
annotations in the form of style-based captions is difficult. This is because
annotating style-based captions requires a certain amount of fashion domain
expertise, and also adds to the costs and manual effort. On the contrary,
low-level attribute based annotations are much more easily available. To
address this issue, we propose a transfer-learning based image captioning model
that is trained on a source dataset with sufficient attribute-based
ground-truth captions, and used to predict style-based captions on a target
dataset. The target dataset has only a limited amount of images with
style-based ground-truth captions. The main motivation of our approach comes
from the fact that most often there are correlations among the low-level
attributes and the higher-level styles for an apparel. We leverage this fact
and train our model in an encoder-decoder based framework using attention
mechanism. In particular, the encoder of the model is first trained on the
source dataset to obtain latent representations capturing the low-level
attributes. The trained model is fine-tuned to generate style-based captions
for the target dataset. To highlight the effectiveness of our method, we
qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that the captions generated by our
approach are close to the actual style information for the evaluated apparel. A
Proof Of Concept for our model is under pilot at Myntra where it is exposed to
some internal users for feedback.

observed by the Dark Energy Survey (DES). The splashback radius for the
complete galaxy sample is consistent with theoretical measurements from
CDM-only simulations, and is located at $2.4^{+0.3}_{-0.4}$ Mpc $h^{-1}$. We
split the sample based on galaxy color and find significant differences in the
profile shapes. Red galaxies and those in the green valley show a
splashback-like minimum in their slope profile consistent with theoretical
predictions, while the bluest galaxies show a weak feature that appears at a
smaller radius. We develop a mapping of galaxies to subhalos in $N$-body
simulations by splitting subhalos based on infall time onto the cluster halos.
We find that the location of the steepest slope and differences in the shapes
of the profiles can be mapped to differences in the average time of infall of
galaxies of different colors. The minima of the slope in the galaxy profiles
trace a discontinuity in the phase space of dark matter halos. By relating
spatial profiles to infall time for galaxies of different colours, we can use
splashback as a clock to understand galaxy quenching. We find that red galaxies
have on average been in their clusters for over $3.2 ~\rm Gyrs$, green galaxies
about $2.2 ~\rm Gyrs$, while blue galaxies have been accreted most recently and
have not reached apocenter. Using the information from the complete radial
profiles, we fit a simple quenching model and find that the onset of galaxy
quenching in clusters occurs after a delay of about a gigayear, and that
galaxies quench rapidly thereafter with an exponential timescale of $0.6$ Gyr.

in the heavy quark mass regime of QCD, its sensitivity to the deconfinement of
light, dynamical quarks in QCD is not apparent. On the other hand, the quark
mass dependence of the Polyakov loop is sensitive to the appearance of a chiral
phase transition. Using lattice QCD calculations in the staggered fermion
discretization scheme at finite values of the lattice spacing, $aT = 1/8$, we
show here, for the first time, that the Polyakov loop expectation value, and
the heavy quark free energy extracted from it, behave like energy-like
observables in the vicinity of the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$.
Consistent with scaling behavior of energy-like observables in the 3-$d$, O(2)
universality class, the quark mass derivatives diverge in the chiral limit at
$T_c$ while the temperature derivatives stay finite. The latter will develop a
characteristic spike at $T_c$. This, however, may be resolved only in
calculations with quark masses being two orders of magnitude smaller than those
currently accessible in lattice QCD calculations.

photometric modulations have recently been discovered with Kepler/K2 (scallop
shells) and TESS (complex rotators). All are part of star-forming associations,
are distinct from other variable stars, and likely belong to a unified class.
Suggested hypotheses include star spots, accreting dust disks, co-rotating
clouds of material, magnetically constrained material, spots and misaligned
disks, and pulsations. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview and add new
observational constraints with TESS and SPECULOOS Southern Observatory (SSO)
photometry. We scrutinize all hypotheses from three new angles: (1) we
investigate each scenario's occurrence rates via young star catalogs; (2) we
study the features' longevity using over one year of combined data; and (3) we
probe the expected color dependency with multi-color photometry. In this
process, we also revisit the stellar parameters accounting for activity
effects, study stellar flares as activity indicators over year-long time
scales, and develop toy models to simulate typical morphologies. We rule out
most hypotheses, and only (i) co-rotating material clouds and (ii) spots and
misaligned disks remain feasible - with caveats. For (i), co-rotating dust
might not be stable enough, while co-rotating gas alone likely cannot cause
percentage-scale features; and (ii) would require misaligned disks around most
young M dwarfs. We thus suggest a unified hypothesis, a superposition of
large-amplitude spot modulations and sharp transits of co-rotating gas clouds.
While the complex rotators' mystery remains, these new observations add
valuable pieces to the puzzle going forward.

leads to a sum over topologies of two-dimensional surfaces of increasing
topological complexity, predicting the possibility of a dual description in
terms of string theory. We extend this argument away from equilibrium, and
study the universal features of the topological expansion in the dual string

forward branch of the time contour, the part $\Sigma^-$ on the backward branch,

cosmological information. It is caused by the additional scattering of CMB
photons by neutral species formed during recombination and exhibits a strong
and unique frequency scaling ($\propto \nu^4$). We will show that with
sufficient sensitivity across frequency channels, the Rayleigh scattering
signal should not only be detectable but can significantly improve constraining
power for cosmological parameters, with limited or no additional modifications
to planned experiments. We will provide heuristic explanations for why certain
cosmological parameters benefit from measurement of the Rayleigh scattering

For example, Eukarya feature membrane-bound organelles such as nuclei and

renders them difficult to study from both an experimental and theoretical
perspective. However, encouraged by a recent experimental result showing that
budding yeast (a unicellular eukaryote) obeys the same proportionality between

set of relations describing eukaryotic growth from first principles of ribosome
biogenesis. We recover the observed ribosomal protein proportionality, and then
continue to obtain two growth-laws for the number of RNA polymerases

are the first of their kind for Eukarya, clarify the coordination of
transcription and translation kinetics as required by ribosome biogenesis, and
link these kinetic parameters to cellular physiology. We demonstrate
application of the relations to the yeast S. cerevisiae and find the
predictions to be in good agreement with currently available data. We then
outline methods to quantitatively deduce several unknown kinetic and

For smooth algebras concentrated in degree $0$, these structures recover the
classical notions of bisymplectic and double Poisson structures, but in general
they involve an infinite hierarchy of higher homotopical data, ensuring that
they are invariant under quasi-isomorphism. The structures induce shifted
symplectic and shifted Poisson structures on the underlying commutative derived
moduli functors, and also on underlying representation functors.
  We show that there are canonical equivalences between the spaces of shifted
bisymplectic structures and of non-degenerate $n$-shifted double Poisson

that are capable of efficiently adapting to new environments while satisfying

approach to maintaining safety in the presence of dynamics uncertainty. Our
approach leverages Bayesian meta-learning with last-layer adaptation. The
expressiveness of neural-network features trained offline, paired with
efficient last-layer online adaptation, enables the derivation of tight
confidence sets which contract around the true dynamics as the model adapts
online. We exploit these confidence sets to plan trajectories that guarantee
the safety of the system. Our approach handles problems with high dynamics
uncertainty, where reaching the goal safely is potentially initially
infeasible, by first \textit{exploring} to gather data and reduce uncertainty,
before autonomously \textit{exploiting} the acquired information to safely
perform the task. Under reasonable assumptions, we prove that our framework
guarantees the high-probability satisfaction of all constraints at all times
jointly, i.e. over the total task duration. This theoretical analysis also
motivates two regularizers of last-layer meta-learning models that improve
online adaptation capabilities as well as performance by reducing the size of
the confidence sets. We extensively demonstrate our approach in simulation and
on hardware.

intra-image invariance learning. The learning typically uses rich intra-image
transformations to construct positive pairs and then maximizes agreement using
a contrastive loss. The merits of inter-image invariance, conversely, remain
much less explored. One major obstacle to exploit inter-image invariance is
that it is unclear how to reliably construct inter-image positive pairs, and
further derive effective supervision from them since no pair annotations are
available. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study to better
understand the role of inter-image invariance learning from three main
constituting components: pseudo-label maintenance, sampling strategy, and
decision boundary design. To facilitate the study, we introduce a unified and
generic framework that supports the integration of unsupervised intra- and
inter-image invariance learning. Through carefully-designed comparisons and
analysis, multiple valuable observations are revealed: 1) online labels
converge faster and perform better than offline labels; 2) semi-hard negative
samples are more reliable and unbiased than hard negative samples; 3) a less
stringent decision boundary is more favorable for inter-image invariance
learning. With all the obtained recipes, our final model, namely InterCLR,
shows consistent improvements over state-of-the-art intra-image invariance

Higher-mass stars pass through the YSG phase again as they evolve blueward

tantalizing glimpse into which stars end their lives as RSGs, and why. One
telltale sign of a post-RSG object may be an instability to pulsations,
depending on the star's interior structure. Here we report the discovery of
five YSGs with pulsation periods faster than 1 day, found in a sample of 76

Fast Yellow Pulsating Supergiants (FYPS). For each FYPS, we extract frequencies
via iterative prewhitening and conduct a time-frequency analysis. One FYPS has
an extracted frequency that is split into a triplet, and the amplitude of that
peak is modulated on the same timescale as the frequency spacing of the
triplet; neither rotation nor binary effects are likely culprits. We discuss

from the perspective of non-equilibrium effective field theory (EFT). In
particular, for each state of matter considered, we find that at least two
(though sometimes multiple) qualitatively different EFTs exist at finite
temperature such that there is always at least one EFT with a propagating
second-sound wave and at least one with no such second-sound wave. To aid in
the construction of these EFTs, we use the method of cosets developed for
non-equilibrium systems. It turns out that the difference between the EFTs with
and without second-sound modes can be understood as arising from different
choices of a new kind of inverse Higgs constraint. Finally, we demonstrate that
it is possible to bypass the need for new inverse Higgs constraints by
formulating EFTs on a new kind of manifold that is like the usual fluid
worldvolume, but with reduced gauge symmetries.

study the scaling of entanglement negativity between $A$ and $B$. For
representative states of self-thermalizing systems, either eigenstates or
states obtained by a long-time evolution of product states, negativity shows a
sharp transition from an area-law scaling to a volume-law scaling when the
subsystem volume fraction is tuned across a finite critical value. In contrast,
for a system with quasiparticles, it exhibits a volume-law scaling irrespective
of the subsystem fraction. For many-body localized systems, the same quantity
shows an area-law scaling for eigenstates, and volume-law scaling for long-time
evolved product states, irrespective of the subsystem fraction. We provide a
combination of numerical observations and analytical arguments in support of
our conjecture. Along the way, we prove and utilize a `continuity bound' for
negativity: we bound the difference in negativity for two density matrices in
terms of the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of their difference.

scaling relations with non-zero scatter, and deviate significantly from them if
and only if the data require it. We have devised a Bayesian hierarchical
inference framework, which enables the determination of all lensing parameters

lensing constraints and (if given) stellar kinematic measurements. We achieve
this through BayesLens, a purpose-built wrapper around common parametric
lensing codes for the lensing likelihood that can sample the posterior on
parameters and hyperparameters, which we release with this paper. We have run
functional tests of our code against simple mock cluster lensing datasets with
realistic uncertainties. The parameters and hyperparameters are recovered
within their 68% credibility ranges, and the positions of all the ""observed""
multiple images are accurately reproduced by the BayeLens best-fit model,
without overfitting. We have shown that an accurate description of cluster
member galaxies is attainable, despite the large number of degrees of freedom,
through fast and tractable inference. This extends beyond the state-of-the-art
of current cluster lensing models. The precise impact on studies of
cosmography, galaxy evolution and high-redshift galaxy populations can then be
quantified on real galaxy clusters. While other sources of systematics exist

  book: ""The Tidal Disruption of Stars by Massive Black Holes""",,,,"astro-ph.HE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  After a star has been tidally disrupted by a black hole, the debris forms an
elongated stream. We start by studying the evolution of this gas before its
bound part returns to the original stellar pericenter. While the axial motion
is entirely ballistic, the transverse directions of the stream are usually
thinner due to the confining effects of self-gravity. This basic picture may
also be influenced by additional physical effects such as clump formation,
hydrogen recombination, magnetic fields and the interaction with the ambient
medium. We then examine the fate of this stream when it comes back to the
vicinity of the black hole to form an accretion flow. Despite recent progress,
the hydrodynamics of this phase remains uncertain due to computational
limitations that have so far prevented us from performing a fully
self-consistent simulation. Most of the initial energy dissipation appears to
be provided by a self-crossing shock that results from an intersection of the
stream with itself. The debris evolution during this collision depends on
relativistic apsidal precession, expansion of the stream from pericenter, and
nodal precession induced by the black hole spin. Although the combined
influence of these effects is not fully understood, current works suggest that
this interaction is typically too weak to significantly circularize the
trajectories, with its main consequence being an expansion of the shocked gas.
Global simulations of disc formation using simplified initial conditions find
that the debris experiences additional collisions that cause its orbits to
become more circular until eventually settling into a thick structure. These
works suggest that this process completes faster for more relativistic
encounters due to stronger shocks. However, important aspects still remain to
be understood at the time of writing, due to numerical challenges and the
complexity of this process.

young radio pulsars. They found that 11 objects have braking indices ranging
$\sim 10-100$, far from the classical value $n=3$. They also noted a mild
correlation between measured value of $n$ and characteristic age of a radio
pulsar. In this article we systematically analyse possible physical origin of
large braking indices. We find that a small fraction of these measurements
could be caused by gravitational acceleration from an unseen ultra-wide
companion of a pulsar or by precession. Remaining braking indices cannot be
explained neither by pulsar obliquity angle evolution, nor by complex
high-order multipole structure of the poloidal magnetic field. The most
plausible explanation is a decay of the poloidal dipole magnetic field which
operates on a time scale $\sim 10^4-10^5$ years in some young objects, but has
significantly longer time scale in other radio pulsars. This decay can explain
both amplitude of measured $n$ and some correlation between $n$ and
characteristic age. The decay can be caused by either enhanced crystal
impurities in the crust of some isolated radio pulsars, or more likely, by
enhanced resistivity related to electron scattering off phonons due to slow
cooling of low-mass neutron stars. If this effect is indeed the main cause of
the rapid magnetic field decay manifesting as large braking indices, we predict
that pulsars with large braking indices are hotter in comparison to those with
$n\approx 3$.

high sensitivity required for blind FRB searches implies a high data rate --
6.5 terabits per second (Tb/s) for CHIME and 0.8 Tb/s for the Pathfinder. Since
such high data rates cannot be continuously saved, we buffer data from both

discuss spontaneous symmetry breaking in the massless bi-scalar fishnet theory.

lead to a massive extension of the massless fishnet theory, differing in how
masses enter into the propagators. In the latter theory, planar off-shell
amplitudes are in one-to-one correspondence with precisely those massive
Feynman integrals that were shown to be invariant under the Yangian. This
suggests a re-investigation of Coulomb branch N=4 SYM theory with regard to

fascinating area of research in condensed matter physics. One of the most
widely investigated scenario of phase competition is that between
superconductivity and magnetism, which in spite of several decades of research
continues to bring up new surprises till date. While superconductivity and
magnetism are naively considered to be antagonists, there are several
circumstances where these many body phases can be found to be cooperating,
coexisting and even promoting each other. The results of such cooperative
behavior are found to show up as exotic quantum phases.
  In this chapter we discuss about such an exotic superconducting phase, which
comes to life when a particular class of superconducting material viz. ""Pauli
limited superconductors"" are subjected to an imbalance between the population
of the fermionic species undergoing pairing. The consequence of such an
imbalance is the emergence of a non-trivial spatially modulated superconducting
phase, popularly known as the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase.
Characterized by a finite momentum pairing between the fermionic species the
FFLO phase hosts a non zero magnetization, leading to an unconventional

than $\sim$ keV, the decay into photons becomes significant, leading again to a
diffuse gamma-ray flux. In the case of only photon coupling, we find, e.g.
$g_{a\gamma} \lesssim 5 \times 10^{-11}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$ for $m_a \sim 5~{\rm

consists of polar scalar-led modes, polar and axial electromagnetic-led modes,
and polar and axial gravitational-led modes. We demonstrate that the only
unstable mode present is the radial scalar-led mode of the cold branch.
Consequently, the bald Reissner-Nordstr\""om branch and the hot scalarized

only slightly broken on the cold branch, but it is strongly broken on the hot

phenomena that originate from strong electron-electron interactions. These
interactions make the Fermi surface highly susceptible to reconstruction when $
\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3$ electrons occupy each moir\' e unit cell and lead to the
formation of correlated insulating, superconducting and ferromagnetic phases.
While some phases have been shown to carry a non-zero Chern number, the local
microscopic properties and topological character of many other phases remain
elusive. Here we introduce a set of novel techniques hinging on scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) to map out topological phases in MATBG that emerge
in finite magnetic field. By following the evolution of the local density of
states (LDOS) at the Fermi level with electrostatic doping and magnetic field,
we visualize a local Landau fan diagram that enables us to directly assign
Chern numbers to all observed phases. We uncover the existence of six
topological phases emanating from integer fillings in finite fields and whose
origin relates to a cascade of symmetry-breaking transitions driven by
correlations. The spatially resolved and electron-density-tuned LDOS maps
further reveal that these topological phases can form only in a small range of
twist angles around the magic-angle value. Both the microscopic origin and
extreme sensitivity to twist angle differentiate these topological phases from
the Landau levels observed near charge neutrality. Moreover, we observe that
even the charge-neutrality Landau spectrum taken at low fields is considerably
modified by interactions and exhibits an unexpected splitting between zero
Landau levels that can be as large as ${\sim }\,3-5$ meV. Our results show how
strong electronic interactions affect the band structure of MATBG and lead to
the formation of correlation-enabled topological phases.

are associated with the breaking of these properties in regions of different
non-trivial topologies. When such topologies are connected, we show that the
non locally generated operators generate an Abelian symmetry group, and their
commutation relations are fixed. The existence of order parameters with area
law, like the Wilson loop for the confinement phase, or the 't Hooft loop for
the dual Higgs phase, is shown to imply the existence of more than one possible
choice of algebras for the same underlying theory. A natural entropic order
parameter arises by this non-uniqueness. We display aspects of the phases of
theories with generalized symmetries in terms of these entropic order
parameters. In particular, the connection between constant and area laws for
dual order and disorder parameters is transparent in this approach, new
constraints arising from conformal symmetry are revealed, and the algebraic
origin of the Dirac quantization condition (and generalizations thereof) is

satisfied by dual relative entropies associated with complementary regions,

Recently, scientists have begun exploring the use of randomized methods for
accelerating quantum simulation. Among them, a simple and powerful technique,
called qDRIFT, is known to generate random product formulas for which the
average quantum channel approximates the ideal evolution. qDRIFT achieves a
gate count that does not explicitly depend on the number of terms in the
Hamiltonian, which contrasts with Suzuki formulas. This work aims to understand
the origin of this speed-up by comprehensively analyzing a single realization
of the random product formula produced by qDRIFT. The main results prove that a
typical realization of the randomized product formula approximates the ideal
unitary evolution up to a small diamond-norm error. The gate complexity is
already independent of the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, but it depends
on the system size and the sum of the interaction strengths in the Hamiltonian.
Remarkably, the same random evolution starting from an arbitrary, but fixed,
input state yields a much shorter circuit suitable for that input state. In
contrast, in deterministic settings, such an improvement usually requires
initial state knowledge. The proofs depend on concentration inequalities for
vector and matrix martingales, and the framework is applicable to other
randomized product formulas. Our bounds are saturated by certain commuting
Hamiltonians.

In light of these conditions, under the effect of class imbalance, we
theoretically analyze four indices commonly used for evaluating binary
classifiers and five popular indices for multi-class classifiers. For indices
violating any of the conditions, we also suggest remedial modification and
normalization. We further investigate the capability of the indices to retain
information about the classification performance over all the classes, even
when the classifier exhibits extreme performance on some classes. Simulation
studies are performed on high dimensional deep representations of subset of the

evidence, we recommend the appropriate indices that should be used to evaluate

first higher-dimensional Hamiltonian no-torsion theorems beyond the
symplectically aspherical case. We start by showing that closed symplectic
Calabi-Yau and negative monotone symplectic manifolds do not admit Hamiltonian
torsion. Going still beyond topological constraints, we prove that every closed
positive monotone symplectic manifold $(M,\omega)$ admitting Hamiltonian
torsion is geometrically uniruled by holomorphic spheres for every
$\omega$-compatible almost complex structure, partially answering a question of
McDuff-Salamon. This provides many additional no-torsion results, and as a
corollary yields the geometric uniruledness of monotone Hamiltonian
$S^1$-manifolds, a fact closely related to a celebrated result of McDuff from
2009. Moreover, the non-existence of Hamiltonian torsion implies the triviality
of Hamiltonian actions of lattices like $SL(k,\mathbb{Z})$ for $k \geq 2,$ as
well as those of compact Lie groups. Finally, for monotone symplectic manifolds
admitting Hamiltonian torsion, we prove an analogue of Newman's theorem on

the most challenging problems in visual object tracking. Unlike many existing
trackers that focus on modeling only the target, in this work, we consider the
\emph{transient variations of the whole scene}. The key insight is that the
object correspondence and spatial layout of the whole scene are consistent
(i.e., global structure consistency) in consecutive frames which helps to
disambiguate the target from distractors. Moreover, modeling transient
variations enables to localize the target under fast variations. Specifically,
we propose an effective and efficient short-term model that learns to exploit
the global structure consistency in a short time and thus can handle fast
variations and distractors. Since short-term modeling falls short of handling
occlusion and out of the views, we adopt the long-short term paradigm and use a
long-term model that corrects the short-term model when it drifts away from the
target or the target is not present. These two components are carefully
combined to achieve the balance of stability and plasticity during tracking. We
empirically verify that the proposed tracker can tackle the two challenging
scenarios and validate it on large scale benchmarks. Remarkably, our tracker
improves state-of-the-art-performance on VOT2018 from 0.440 to 0.460, GOT-10k

challenges at the intersection of cyber and physical spaces. One prime example
is the vulnerability of Face Recognition (FR) based access control in IoT
systems. While previous research has shown that Deep Neural Network(DNN)-based
FR systems (FRS) are potentially susceptible to imperceptible impersonation
attacks, the potency of such attacks in a wide set of scenarios has not been
thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we present the first systematic,
wide-ranging measurement study of the exploitability of DNN-based FR systems
using a large scale dataset. We find that arbitrary impersonation attacks,
wherein an arbitrary attacker impersonates an arbitrary target, are hard if
imperceptibility is an auxiliary goal. Specifically, we show that factors such
as skin color, gender, and age, impact the ability to carry out an attack on a
specific target victim, to different extents. We also study the feasibility of
constructing universal attacks that are robust to different poses or views of
the attacker's face. Our results show that finding a universal perturbation is
a much harder problem from the attacker's perspective. Finally, we find that
the perturbed images do not generalize well across different DNN models. This
suggests security countermeasures that can dramatically reduce the
exploitability of DNN-based FR systems.

and LSRTM as PDE-constrained optimization problems. Due to the large-scale
nature, gradient-based optimization algorithms are preferred in practice to
update the model iteratively. Higher-order methods converge in fewer iterations
but often require higher computational costs, more line search steps, and
bigger memory storage. A balance among these aspects has to be considered. We
propose using Anderson acceleration (AA), a popular strategy to speed up the
convergence of fixed-point iterations, to accelerate the steepest descent
algorithm, which we innovatively treat as a fixed-point iteration. Independent
of the dimensionality of the unknown parameters, the computational cost of
implementing the method can be reduced to an extremely low-dimensional
least-squares problem. The cost can be further reduced by a low-rank update. We
discuss the theoretical connections and the differences between AA and other
well-known optimization methods such as L-BFGS and the restarted GMRES and
compare their computational cost and memory demand. Numerical examples of FWI
and LSRTM applied to the Marmousi benchmark demonstrate the acceleration
effects of AA. Compared with the steepest descent method, AA can achieve fast
convergence and provide competitive results with some quasi-Newton methods,
making it an attractive optimization strategy for seismic inversion.

neighboring domains over interface regions having finite volume, in contrast to
the local PDE setting in which interfaces are lower dimensional manifolds
separating abutting subdomains. Key results include the equivalence between the
global, single-domain nonlocal problem and its multi-domain reformulation, both
at the continuous and discrete levels. These results provide the rigorous
foundation necessary for the development of efficient solution strategies for
nonlocal domain-decomposition methods.

mean-field level we demonstrate that at temperature $T\to 0$ the gradient term
in the effective action can be tuned to zero for experimentally relevant sets
of parameters, thus providing an avenue to realize a quantum Lifshitz point. We
subsequently analyze damping processes affecting the order-parameter field
across the phase transition. We show that, in the low energy limit, Landau
damping occurs only in the symmetry-broken phase and affects exclusively the
longitudinal component of the order-parameter field. It is however unavoidably
present in the immediate vicinity of the phase transition at temperature $T=0$.
We subsequently perform a renormalization-group analysis of the system in a
situation, where, at mean-field level, the quantum phase transition is second
order (and not multicritical). We find that, at $T$ sufficiently low, including
the Landau damping term in a form derived from the microscopic action
destabilizes the renormalization group flow towards the Wilson-Fisher fixed
point. This signals a possible tendency to drive the transition weakly
first-order by the coupling between the order-parameter fluctuations and
fermionic excitations effectively captured by the Landau damping contribution
to the order-parameter action.

the design can be traced back to the solution of kernel equations already found

This is known to be robust compared to the monolithic Newton method, however,
the staggered scheme often requires many iterations to converge when cracks are
evolving. The focus of our work is to accelerate the solver through a scheme
that sequentially applies Anderson acceleration and over-relaxation, switching
back and forth depending on the residual evolution, and thereby ensuring a

strengths of Anderson acceleration and over-relaxation to make a robust and
accelerating method for this problem. The new method is applied as a
post-processing technique to the increments of the solver, hence, the

negligible. The robustness and efficiency of the method are demonstrated

thousands of degrees, if they are not cooled to reasonable operating
temperatures. The problem of hot spots is not limited to the high temperatures
of the IC; thermal stress can also pose severe problems, even after cooling the
chip. This study investigates thermal stress resulting from a 3D-IC hot spot
with 20 W power dissipation. The IC is cooled using SiO2 and diamond cooling
blocks. The study is performed using three cooling liquids: water, Freon (R22),
and Liquid Nitrogen (LN). As expected, the study shows that metal layers on the
chip suffer from high thermal stress due to rising the chip temperature to
values higher than the room temperature. It is also noticed that the stress
becomes more severe, if cooling is done using LN. In fact, the stress exceeded
the maximum tensile strength of aluminum, which means failure of the chip. This
indicates that cooling 3D-IC may not ensure acceptable operation or
reliability. Thermal stress must be investigated at both high and low
temperatures to ensure high performance and acceptable reliability.

obey two selection rules: (i) conservation of the total azimuthal number of the
resultant spin-wave modes, and (ii) inequality for the radial numbers of
interacting modes, if the mode directly excited by the driving field is
radially symmetric (i.e. if the azimuthal number of the directly excited mode

It is important to validate both the timing and functional correctness of these
systems. However, most approaches in the literature consider guaranteeing only
the functionality of ANN based controllers. This issue stems largely from the
implementation strategies used within common neural network frameworks -- their
underlying source code is often simply unsuitable for formal techniques such as
static timing analysis. As a result, developers of safety-critical CPS must
rely on informal techniques such as measurement based approaches to prove
correctness, techniques that provide weak guarantees at best. In this work we
address this challenge. We propose a design pipeline whereby neural networks
trained using the popular deep learning framework Keras are compiled to
functionally equivalent C code. This C code is restricted to simple constructs
that may be analysed by existing static timing analysis tools. As a result, if
compiled to a suitable time-predictable platform all execution bounds may be
statically derived. To demonstrate the benefits of our approach we execute an
ANN trained to drive an autonomous vehicle around a race track. We compile the
ANN to the Patmos time-predictable controller, and show that we can derive

theory (HFGT) based modeling framework for these integrated infrastructures
followed by an analysis of network robustness. The supporting infrastructures
along with the infrastructure repair facilities are considered. In contrast to
conventional graph representations, a weighted HFGT model is used to capture
the system processes and mutual dependencies among resources. To assess
robustness of the inter-dependent networks, impacts of complete/partial and
random/targeted attacks are quantified. Specifically, various contingency
scenarios are simulated and the vulnerability of the network is evaluated.
Additionally, several robustness metrics are proposed to provide a
comprehensive evaluation of system robustness. The proposed weighted HFGT
modeling and robustness assessment approach is tested using a synthetic
interdependent network, comprising of an electrical power system, a water
network, a district heating network, a natural gas system and a road
transportation network. Results demonstrate that system robustness can be
enhanced via securing system information and mitigating attack strength.

Although several measurements indicate that they are less affected by band

efficiencies are still low. To identify possible issues, we characterize CBTS
and CSTS in parallel by a variety of spectroscopic methods complemented by
first-principles calculations. Two main problems are identified in both
materials. The first is the existence of deep defect transitions in
low-temperature photoluminescence, pointing to a high density of bulk
recombination centers. The second is a low electron affinity, which emphasizes
the need for an alternative heterojunction partner and electron contact. We
also find a tendency for downward band bending at the surface of both
materials. In CBTS, this effect is sufficiently large to cause carrier type
inversion, which may enhance carrier separation and mitigate interface
recombination. Optical absorption at room temperature is exciton-enhanced in
both CBTS and CSTS. Deconvolution of excitonic effects yields band gaps that
are about 100 meV higher than previous estimates based on Tauc plots. Although
the two investigated materials are remarkably similar in an idealized,
defect-free picture, the present work points to CBTS as a more promising
absorber than CSTS for tandem photovoltaics.

regularized with a convex penalty in high-dimensional linear regression where
$(X,y)$ is observed and $p,n$ are of the same order. If $\psi$ is the
derivative of the robust data-fitting loss $\rho$, the estimate depends on the
observed data only through the quantities $\hat\psi = \psi(y-X\hat\beta)$,
$X^\top \hat\psi$ and the derivatives $(\partial/\partial y) \hat\psi$ and
$(\partial/\partial y) X\hat\beta$ for fixed $X$.
  The out-of-sample error estimate enjoys a relative error of order $n^{-1/2}$
in a linear model with Gaussian covariates and independent noise, either
non-asymptotically when $p/n\le \gamma$ or asymptotically in the
high-dimensional asymptotic regime $p/n\to\gamma'\in(0,\infty)$. General
differentiable loss functions $\rho$ are allowed provided that $\psi=\rho'$ is
1-Lipschitz. The validity of the out-of-sample error estimate holds either
under a strong convexity assumption, or for the $\ell_1$-penalized Huber
M-estimator if the number of corrupted observations and sparsity of the true
$\beta$ are bounded from above by $s_*n$ for some small enough constant
$s_*\in(0,1)$ independent of $n,p$.
  For the square loss and in the absence of corruption in the response, the
results additionally yield $n^{-1/2}$-consistent estimates of the noise
variance and of the generalization error. This generalizes, to arbitrary convex
penalty, estimates that were previously known for the Lasso.

can give the listener a more accurate representation of the information

and crisp manner. Detection of such regions is of great importance for proper
understanding of a document. Tabular structures can be of various layouts and
types. Therefore, detection of these regions is a hard problem. Most of the
existing techniques detect tables from a document image by using prior
knowledge of the structures of the tables. However, these methods are not
applicable for generalized tabular structures. In this work, we propose a
similarity measure to find similarities between pairs of rows in a tabular
structure. This similarity measure is utilized to identify a tabular region.
Since the tabular regions are detected exploiting the similarities among all
rows, the method is inherently independent of layouts of the tabular regions
present in the training data. Moreover, the proposed similarity measure can be
used to identify tabular regions without using large sets of parameters
associated with recent deep learning based methods. Thus, the proposed method
can easily be used with resource constrained devices such as mobile devices
without much of an overhead.

\nu \nu \overline{\nu}$ with a new scalar $\phi$ results in upper limits for

simultaneous explanations of all anomalies is in tension with KamLAND,
Super-Kamiokande, and Borexino constraints on the flux of solar antineutrinos.
We then present other minimal models that violate parity or lepton number, and
discuss the applicability of our constraints in each case. Future improvements
can be expected from existing Borexino data as well as from future searches at

objective of the ego automated vehicle is to execute an efficient and smooth
policy without collision. Then, the particular algorithm named proximal policy
optimization (PPO)-enhanced DRL is illustrated. To overcome the challenges in
tardy training efficiency and sample inefficiency, this applied algorithm could
realize high learning efficiency and excellent control performance. Finally,
the PPO-DRL-based decision-making strategy is estimated from multiple
perspectives, including the optimality, learning efficiency, and adaptability.

accomplish both tasks of outcome and margin prediction where the network
benefits from learning the tumor resection margin related features to improve

filter which content is fed to social networks users has come under scrutiny.
Supposedly, the algorithms promote marketing strategies, but can also
facilitate the formation of filters bubbles in which a user is most likely
exposed to opinions that conform to their own. In the two-state majority-vote
model an individual adopts an opinion contrary to the majority of its neighbors
with probability $q$, defined as the noise parameter. Here, we introduce a
visibility parameter $V$ in the dynamics of the majority-vote model, which
equals the probability of an individual ignoring the opinion of each one of its
neighbors. For $V=0.5$ each individual will, on average, ignore the opinion of
half of its neighboring nodes. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to calculate
the critical noise parameter as a function of the visibility $q_c(V)$ and
obtain the phase diagram of the model. We find that the critical noise is an
increasing function of the visibility parameter, such that a lower value of $V$
favors dissensus. Via finite-size scaling analysis we obtain the critical
exponents of the model, which are visibility-independent, and show that the
model belongs to the Ising universality class. We compare our results to the
case of a network submitted to a static site dilution, and find that the
limited visibility model is a more subtle way of inducing opinion polarization

research on the etiology of chronic diseases. Yet, identifying critical
time-windows during which risk factors have the strongest impact on disease
risk is challenging. To assess the trajectory of association of an exposure
history with an outcome, the weighted cumulative exposure index (WCIE) has been
proposed, with weights reflecting the relative importance of exposures at
different times. However, WCIE is restricted to a complete observed error-free
exposure whereas exposures are often measured with intermittent missingness and
error. Moreover, it rarely explores exposure history that is very distant from
the outcome as usually sought in life-course epidemiology. We extend the WCIE
methodology to (i) exposures that are intermittently measured with error, and
(ii) contexts where the exposure time-window precedes the outcome time-window
using a landmark approach. First, the individual exposure history up to the
landmark time is estimated using a mixed model that handles missing data and
error in exposure measurement, and the predicted complete error-free exposure
history is derived. Then the WCIE methodology is applied to assess the
trajectory of association between the predicted exposure history and the health
outcome collected after the landmark time. In our context, the health outcome
is a longitudinal marker analyzed using a mixed model. A simulation study first
demonstrates the correct inference obtained with this approach. Then, applied
to the Nurses' Health Study (19,415 women) to investigate the association
between BMI history (collected from midlife) and subsequent cognitive decline
after age 70. In conclusion, this approach, easy to implement, provides a
flexible tool for studying complex dynamic relationships and identifying
critical time windows while accounting for exposure measurement errors.

performances in many tasks in natural language understanding (NLU). The tokens
in the models are usually fine-grained in the sense that for languages like
English they are words or sub-words and for languages like Chinese they are
characters. In English, for example, there are multi-word expressions which
form natural lexical units and thus the use of coarse-grained tokenization also
appears to be reasonable. In fact, both fine-grained and coarse-grained
tokenizations have advantages and disadvantages for learning of pre-trained
language models. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-trained language model,
referred to as AMBERT (A Multi-grained BERT), on the basis of both fine-grained
and coarse-grained tokenizations. For English, AMBERT takes both the sequence
of words (fine-grained tokens) and the sequence of phrases (coarse-grained
tokens) as input after tokenization, employs one encoder for processing the
sequence of words and the other encoder for processing the sequence of the
phrases, utilizes shared parameters between the two encoders, and finally
creates a sequence of contextualized representations of the words and a
sequence of contextualized representations of the phrases. Experiments have
been conducted on benchmark datasets for Chinese and English, including CLUE,
GLUE, SQuAD and RACE. The results show that AMBERT can outperform BERT in all
cases, particularly the improvements are significant for Chinese. We also
develop a method to improve the efficiency of AMBERT in inference, which still
performs better than BERT with the same computational cost as BERT.

nodes from 3D multi-modality imaging is a clinical task of paramount
importance. In radiotherapy, they are referred to as Lymph Node Gross Tumor
Volume (GTVLN). Determining and delineating the spread of GTVLN is essential in
defining the corresponding resection and irradiating regions for the downstream
workflows of surgical resection and radiotherapy of various cancers. In this
work, we propose an effective distance-based gating approach to simulate and
simplify the high-level reasoning protocols conducted by radiation oncologists,
in a divide-and-conquer manner. GTVLN is divided into two subgroups of
tumor-proximal and tumor-distal, respectively, by means of binary or soft
distance gating. This is motivated by the observation that each category can
have distinct though overlapping distributions of appearance, size and other LN
characteristics. A novel multi-branch detection-by-segmentation network is
trained with each branch specializing on learning one GTVLN category features,
and outputs from multi-branch are fused in inference. The proposed method is
evaluated on an in-house dataset of $141$ esophageal cancer patients with both
PET and CT imaging modalities. Our results validate significant improvements on
the mean recall from $72.5\%$ to $78.2\%$, as compared to previous
state-of-the-art work. The highest achieved GTVLN recall of $82.5\%$ at $20\%$
precision is clinically relevant and valuable since human observers tend to
have low sensitivity (around $80\%$ for the most experienced radiation
oncologists, as reported by literature).

via the optical photometry and have constrained the binary mass ratio and its
possible range. The median value of the mass ratio is 0.048 and the upper limit
is 0.057, which still implies that EG Cnc is one of the possible candidates for
the period bouncer. This object also showed multiple rebrightenings in this
superoutburst, which are the same as those in its previous superoutburst in
1996--1997 despite the difference in the main superoutburst. This would
represent that the rebrightening type is inherent to each object and is
independent of the initial disk mass at the beginning of superoutbursts. We
also found that $B-I$ and $J-K_{\rm S}$ colors were unusually red just before
the rebrightening phase and became bluer during the quiescence between
rebrightenings, which would mean that the low-temperature mass reservoir at the
outermost disk accreted with time after the main superoutburst. Also, the
ultraviolet flux was sensitive to rebrightenings as well as the optical flux,
and the $U-B$ color became redder during the rebrightening phase, which would
indicate that the inner disk became cooler when this object repeated
rebrightenings. Our results thus basically support the idea that the cool mass
reservoir in the outermost disk is responsible for rebrightenings.

such visual task, central for the measurement of important variables such as:
measurement of bud sunlight exposure, autonomous pruning, bud counting,

bud area, and bud development stage, among others. This paper presents a
computer method for grapevine bud detection based on a Fully Convolutional
Networks MobileNet architecture (FCN-MN). To validate its performance, this
architecture was compared in the detection task with a strong method for bud
detection, Scanning Windows (SW) based on a patch classifier, showing
improvements over three aspects of detection: segmentation, correspondence
identification and localization. The best version of FCN-MN showed a detection
F1-measure of $88.6\%$ (for true positives defined as detected components whose
intersection-over-union with the true bud is above $0.5$), and false positives
that are small and near the true bud. Splits -- false positives overlapping the
true bud -- showed a mean segmentation precision of $89.3\% (21.7)$, while
false alarms -- false positives not overlapping the true bud -- showed a mean
pixel area of only $8\%$ the area of a true bud, and a distance (between mass
centers) of $1.1$ true bud diameters. The paper concludes by discussing how
these results for FCN-MN would produce sufficiently accurate measurements of
bud variables such as bud number, bud area, and internode length, suggesting a

a realistic and challenging problem when the source domain label space
substitutes the target domain. Most conventional domain adaptation (DA) efforts
concentrate on learning domain-invariant features to mitigate the distribution
disparity across domains. However, it is crucial to alleviate the negative
influence caused by the irrelevant source domain categories explicitly for PDA.
In this work, we propose an Adaptively-Accumulated Knowledge Transfer framework
(A$^2$KT) to align the relevant categories across two domains for effective
domain adaptation. Specifically, an adaptively-accumulated mechanism is
explored to gradually filter out the most confident target samples and their
corresponding source categories, promoting positive transfer with more
knowledge across two domains. Moreover, a dual distinct classifier architecture
consisting of a prototype classifier and a multilayer perceptron classifier is
built to capture intrinsic data distribution knowledge across domains from
various perspectives. By maximizing the inter-class center-wise discrepancy and
minimizing the intra-class sample-wise compactness, the proposed model is able
to obtain more domain-invariant and task-specific discriminative
representations of the shared categories data. Comprehensive experiments on
several partial domain adaptation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of
our proposed model, compared with the state-of-the-art PDA methods.

discussed how the traveler case reports could aid in a timely detection of a
disease outbreak. Methods: Using the traveler data, we estimated a few
indicators of the epidemic that affected decision making and policy, including
the exponential growth rate, the doubling time, and the probability of severe
cases exceeding the hospital capacity, in the initial phase of the COVID-19
epidemic in multiple countries. We imputed the arrival dates when they were
missing. We compared the estimates from the traveler data to the ones from
domestic data. We quantitatively evaluated the influence of each case report
and knowing the arrival date on the estimation. Findings: We estimated the
travel origin's daily exponential growth rate and examined the date from which
the growth rate was consistently above 0.1 (equivalent to doubling time < 7
days). We found those dates were very close to the dates that critical
decisions were made such as city lock-downs and national emergency
announcement. Using only the traveler data, if the assumed epidemic start date
was relatively accurate and the traveler sample was representative of the
general population, the growth rate estimated from the traveler data was
consistent with the domestic data. We also discussed situations that the
traveler data could lead to biased estimates. From the data influence study, we
found more recent travel cases had a larger influence on each day's estimate,
and the influence of each case report got smaller as more cases became
available. We provided the minimum number of exported cases needed to determine
whether the local epidemic growth rate was above a certain level, and developed
a user-friendly Shiny App to accommodate various scenarios.

layer edge states are stabilized by internal electric fields created by
polarized molecular alignment of organic cations in 2D hybrid perovskites when

quadratically. Moreover, training with data from two domains only at a time

more useful features and hinders the progress of this research area. In this
work, we propose a general framework for unsupervised image-to-image
translation across multiple domains, which can translate images from domain X
to any a domain without requiring direct training between the two domains
involved in image translation. A byproduct of the framework is the reduction of
computing time and computing resources, since it needs less time than training

  Detection of Amplified Spontaneous Emission Noise",,"Quantum Sci. Technol. 6(1), 015002 (2020)",,,"quant-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) noise has been extensively studied
and employed to build quantum random number generators (QRNGs). While the
previous relative works mainly focus on the realization and verification of the
QRNG system, the comprehensive physical model and randomness quantification for
the general detection of the ASE noise are still incomplete, which is essential
for the quantitative security analysis. In this paper, a systematical physical
model for the emission, detection and acquisition of the ASE noise with added
electronic noise is developed and verified, based on which the numerical
simulations are performed under various setups and the simulation results all
significantly fit well with the corresponding experimental data. Then, a
randomness quantification method and the corresponding experimentally
verifiable approach are proposed and validated, which quantifies the randomness
purely resulted from the quantum process and improves the security analysis for
the QRNG based on the detection of the ASE noise. The physical model and the
randomness quantification method proposed in this paper are of significant
feasibility and applicable for the QRNG system with randomness originating from
the detection of the photon number with arbitrary distributions.

practical research problem among image and video processing community. Compared
to the frame-level annotations of anomalous events, obtaining video-level
annotations is quite fast and cheap though such high-level labels may contain
significant noise. More specifically, an anomalous labeled video may actually
contain anomaly only in a short duration while the rest of the video frames may
be normal. In the current work, we propose a weakly supervised anomaly
detection framework based on deep neural networks which is trained in a
self-reasoning fashion using only video-level labels. To carry out the
self-reasoning based training, we generate pseudo labels by using binary
clustering of spatio-temporal video features which helps in mitigating the
noise present in the labels of anomalous videos. Our proposed formulation
encourages both the main network and the clustering to complement each other in
achieving the goal of more accurate anomaly detection. The proposed framework
has been evaluated on publicly available real-world anomaly detection datasets
including UCF-crime, ShanghaiTech and UCSD Ped2. The experiments demonstrate
superiority of our proposed framework over the current state-of-the-art
methods.

wetting and dust contamination for real-life applications but also reinforces
its solar reflectance by sunlight backscattering. The paper fibers, when

performance of 5$^{\circ}$C and radiative cooling power of 104 W/m$^2$ under

appropriate visible wavelengths to display specific colors and effectively
reflect near-infrared lights to reduce solar heating, which synchronously

this biologically plausible scenario, a transition from the usual delayed

inhibitory conductances in the receiver population. Here we show that depending

  In this work, we study more general AMP algorithms for random matrices $W$

spectral distribution that is different from the semicircle and Marcenko-Pastur

Self-Contained Confidence (SCC) by adapting model uncertainty for WSL setting,

Therefore, a simple yet effective WSL framework is proposed. A series of

samples to achieve good performance, and may not generalize well when the task
is modified, even if the new task is related. In this paper we are interested
in a collaborative scheme in which multiple agents with different tasks
optimize their policies jointly. To this end, we introduce cross-learning, in
which agents tackling related tasks have their policies constrained to be close
to one another. Two properties make our new approach attractive: (i) it
produces a multi-task central policy that can be used as a starting point to
adapt quickly to one of the tasks trained for, in a situation when the agent
does not know which task is currently facing, and (ii) as in meta-learning, it
adapts to environments related but different to those seen during training. We
focus on continuous policies belonging to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces for
which we bound the distance between the task-specific policies and the
cross-learned policy. To solve the resulting optimization problem, we resort to
a projected policy gradient algorithm and prove that it converges to a
near-optimal solution with high probability. We evaluate our methodology with a
navigation example in which agents can move through environments with obstacles

given in terms of linear combinations of finitely many Gaussian and Chi-square

are unexplained by current models. We investigate the non-thermal broadening
associated with plasma heating in coronal loops that is induced by magnetic
field line braiding. Methods: We describe the coronal loop by a 3D
magnetohydrodynamic model of the turbulent decay of an initially-braided
magnetic field. From this we synthesize the Fe XII line at 193 Angstroms that
forms around 1.5 MK. Results: Key features of current observations of extreme
UV lines from the corona are reproduced in the synthesised spectra: (i) Typical
non-thermal widths range from 15 to 20 km/s. (ii) The widths are approximately
independent of the size of the field of view. (iii) There is a correlation
between line intensity and the non-thermal broadening. (iv) Spectra are found
to be non-Gaussian, with enhanced power in the wings of order 10-20%.
Conclusions: Our model provides an explanation that self-consistently connects
the heating process to the observed non-thermal line broadening. The
non-Gaussian nature of the spectra is a consequence of the non-Gaussian nature
of the underlying velocity fluctuations, interpreted as a signature of
intermittency in the turbulence.

many interesting chiroptical effects such as optical rotation and circular
dichroism. When such systems are placed periodically in a lattice form, in
addition to intrinsic chirality, extrinsic chirality also takes part, and the
overall effect depends not only on the basis and lattice but also the
excitation configuration. Here, we study planar chiral nanohole arrays in
square lattice that support Bloch-like surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) and
clarify how the system geometry and the excitation contribute to circular
dichroism. By using temporal coupled mode theory (CMT), the dissymmetry factor
and the scattering matrix of the arrays are analytically formulated.
Remarkably, we find the dissymmetry factor depends only on the coupling
polarization angle and the in-coupling phase difference between the p- and
s-polarizations. Besides, the upper limit of the dissymmetry factor at +/-2 can
be reached simply by orienting the lattice of the arrays for properly exciting
the Bloch-like SPPs and at the same time making the basis mimic two orthogonal
and relatively displaced dipoles, demonstrating the interplay between extrinsic
and intrinsic chirality. The models have been verified by numerical simulations
and experiments, yielding the dissymmetry factors to be 1.82 and 1.55,

that the simple exploration-free algorithm using the LASSO estimator already

traverse the structure. This paper addresses the algorithmic problems in
scaling reconfigurable space structures built through robotic construction,
where reconfiguration is defined as the problem of transforming an initial
structure into a different goal configuration. We analyze different algorithmic
paradigms and present corresponding abstractions and graph formulations,
examining specialized algorithms that consider discretized space and time
steps. We then discuss fundamental design trades for different computational
architectures, such as centralized versus distributed, and present two
representative algorithms as concrete examples for comparison. We analyze how
those algorithms achieve different objective functions and goals, such as
minimization of total distance traveled, maximization of fault-tolerance, or
minimization of total time spent in assembly. This is meant to offer an
impression of algorithmic constraints on scalability of corresponding
structural and robotic design. From this study, a set of recommendations is
developed on where and when to use each paradigm, as well as implications for
physical robotic and structural system design.

importance has been largely manifested in phase transitions by its spontaneous

phase transitions, inapplicable of the symmetry description, have been
discovered and often dubbed hidden order transitions, as found in, $\it{e.g.}$,
high-$T_C$ cuprates, heavy fermion superconductors, and quantum spin liquid
candidates. Here, we report a new type of hidden order transition in a
correlated heterostructure Sr$_2$VO$_3$FeAs, whose origin is attributed to an
unusually enhanced Kondo-type proximity coupling between localized spins of V
and itinerant electrons of FeAs. Most notably, a fully isotropic gap opening,
identified by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, occurs selectively in
one of the Fermi surfaces below $T_{\rm HO}$ $\sim$ 150 K, associated with a
singular behavior of the specific heat and a strong enhancement on the
anisotropic magnetoresistance. These observations are incompatible with the
prevalent broken-symmetry-driven scenarios of electronic gap opening and
highlight a critical role of proximity coupling. Our findings demonstrate that
correlated heterostructures offer a novel platform for design and engineering
of exotic hidden order phases.

consider all together the multi-cell topology, imperfect spreading factor (SF)

for all of these factors, we initially develop the SF-dependent collision
overlap time function for any start time distribution. Then, we analyse the
Laplace transforms of intra-cluster and inter-cluster interference, and
formulate the uplink transmission success probability. Through simulation
results, we highlight the vulnerability of each SF to interference, illustrate
the impact of parameters such as the network density, and the power allocation
scheme on the network performance. Uniquely, our results shed light on when it
is better to activate adaptive power mechanisms, as we show that an SF-based
power allocation that approximates LoRa ADR, negatively impacts nodes near the

(AWGN) and impulse noise (IN) is an essential but challenging problem. The
presence of impulsive disturbances inevitably affects the distribution of
noises and thus largely degrades the performance of traditional AWGN denoisers.
Existing methods target to compensate the effects of IN by introducing a
weighting matrix, which, however, is lack of proper priori and thus hard to be
accurately estimated. To address this problem, we exploit the Pareto
distribution as the priori of the weighting matrix, based on which an accurate
and robust weight estimator is proposed for mixed noise removal. Particularly,
a relatively small portion of pixels are assumed to be contaminated with IN,
which should have weights with small values and then be penalized out. This
phenomenon can be properly described by the Pareto distribution of type 1.
Therefore, armed with the Pareto distribution, we formulate the problem of
mixed noise removal in the Bayesian framework, where nonlocal self-similarity
priori is further exploited by adopting nonlocal low rank approximation.
Compared to existing methods, the proposed method can estimate the weighting
matrix adaptively, accurately, and robust for different level of noises, thus
can boost the denoising performance. Experimental results on widely used image
datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method to the
state-of-the-arts.

conventional layer-by-layer model of twin nucleation, the recently proposed

categorization of SL and investigating the sub-type moderately supervised
learning (MSL) that concerns the situation where the given labels are ideal,
but due to the simplicity in annotation, careful designs are required to
transform the given labels into easy-to-learn targets. From the perspectives of
the definition, framework and generality, we conceptualize MSL to present a
complete fundamental basis to systematically analyse MSL tasks. At meantime,
revealing the relation between the conceptualization of MSL and the
mathematicians' vision, this paper as well establishes a tutorial for AI
application engineers to refer to viewing a problem to be solved from the
mathematicians' vision.

coarse handcrafted cues. Then a semantic diffusion loss is proposed to resolve
the ambiguity in the generated anchors via the feature correlation between
adjacent video frames. In the experiments on the binary instrument segmentation
task of the 2017 MICCAI EndoVis Robotic Instrument Segmentation Challenge

in radial velocity are affected by stellar magnetic activity and photospheric
dynamics. The effect of granulation, and even more so of supergranulation, has
been shown to be significant in the solar case. Our study is aimed at
quantifying the impact of these flows for other stars and estimating how such
contributions affect their performance. We analysed a broad array of extended
synthetic time series that model these processes for main sequence stars with
spectral types from F6 to K4, focusing on Earth-mass planets orbiting within
the habitable zone around those stars. We estimated the expected detection
rates and detection limits, and performed blind tests. We find that both
granulation and supergranulation on these stars significantly affect planet
mass characterisation in radial velocity when performing a follow-up of a
transit detection, with uncertainties sometimes below 20% for a 1 MEarth, but
much larger for supergranulation. For granulation and low levels of
supergranulation, the detection rates are good for K and late G stars (if the
number of points is large), but poor for more massive stars. The highest level
of supergranulation leads to a very poor performance, even for K stars; this is
both due to low detection rates and to high levels of false positives, even for
a very dense temporal sampling over ten years. False positive levels estimated
from standard false alarm probabilities sometimes significantly overestimate or
underestimate the true level, depending on the number of points. We conclude
that granulation and supergranulation significantly affect the performance of
exoplanet detectability. Future works will focus on improving the following
aspects: decreasing the number of false positives, increasing detection rates,
and improving the false alarm probability estimations from observations.

undertake a rigorous systematic study of $LGD$ and establish several analytical
and statistical properties. First, we show that, when the underlying
probability distribution is absolutely continuous with density $f(\cdot)$, the
scaled version of $LGD$ (referred to as $\tau$-approximation) converges,
uniformly and in $L^d(\mathbb{R}^p)$ to $f(\cdot)$ when $\tau$ converges to
zero. Second, we establish that, as the sample size diverges to infinity the
centered and scaled sample $LGD$ converge in distribution to a centered
Gaussian process uniformly in the space of bounded functions on
$\mathcal{H}_G$, a class of functions yielding $LGD$. Third, using the sample
version of the $\tau$-approximation ($S \tau A$) and the gradient system
analysis, we develop a new clustering algorithm. The validity of this algorithm
requires several results concerning the uniform finite difference approximation
of the gradient system associated with $S \tau A$. For this reason, we
establish \emph{Bernstein}-type inequality for deviations between the centered
and scaled sample $LGD$, which is also of independent interest. Finally,
invoking the above results, we establish consistency of the clustering
algorithm. Applications of the proposed methods to mode estimation and upper
level set estimation are also provided. Finite sample performance of the
methodology are evaluated using numerical experiments and data analysis.

It is found that social awareness can effectively contain the spread by
lowering the basic reproduction rate $R_0$. Interestingly, the awareness is
found to be more effective in a society which can adopt the awareness faster
compared to the one having a slower response. The paper also separates the
mortality fraction from the clinically recovered fraction and attempts to model
the outcome of lockdowns, in absence and presence of social awareness. It is
seen that staggered exits from lockdowns are not only economically beneficial
but also helps to curb the infection spread. Moreover, a staggered exit
strategy with progressive social awareness is found to be the most efficient
intervention. The paper also explores the effects of anthropogenic migration on
the dynamics of the epidemic in a two-zone scenario. The calculations yield
dissimilar evolution of different fractions in different zones. Such models can
be convenient to strategize the division of a large zone into smaller sub-zones
for a disproportionate imposition of lockdown, or, an exit from one.

present in commercially available STO substrates due to the tolerance of
surface preparation which result in small miscut angles of the order of gamma ~
0.1{\deg} with respect to the surface normal. By a controlled increase of the
substrate miscut we could systematically reduce the width of the terraces and
thereby increase the density of substrate surface steps. The in-plane
anisotropy of the electrical resistance was studied as a function of the miscut
angle gamma and found to be mainly related to interfacial scattering arising
from the substrate surface steps. However, the influence of gamma was notably
reduced by the occurrence of step-bunching and lattice-dislocations in the STO
substrate material.
  Magnetoresistance (MR) depends on the current orientation as well, reflecting
the anisotropy of carrier mobility. For gamma >= 2{\deg}, MR is substantially
enhanced and shows the trend towards a linear field dependence which is typical
for inhomogeneous conductors. From weak-antilocalization observed at small
magnetic field we deduce information on inelastic scattering and spin-orbit
coupling. While the field scale associated with a Rashba-type spin-orbit

such approaches have been proposed and proved to be adaptively optimal, i.e.
they achieve the optimal sample complexity for a large class of properties
within a low accuracy, especially for a large estimation error $\varepsilon\gg
n^{-1/3}$ where $n$ is the sample size.
  In this paper, we characterize the high accuracy limitation, or the penalty
for adaptation, for all such approaches. Specifically, we show that under a
mild assumption that the distribution estimator is close to the true sorted
distribution in expectation, any adaptive approach cannot achieve the optimal
sample complexity for every $1$-Lipschitz property within accuracy $\varepsilon
\ll n^{-1/3}$. In particular, this result disproves a conjecture in [Acharya et
al. 2017] that the profile maximum likelihood (PML) plug-in approach is optimal
in property estimation for all ranges of $\varepsilon$, and confirms a
conjecture in [Han and Shiragur, 2021] that their competitive analysis of the
PML is tight.

of extra galactic FRBs exhibit X/gamma-ray outbursts and whether it is
correlated with radio activity. We aim to constrain possible X/gamma-ray burst
activity from one of the nearest extragalactic FRB sources currently known over
a broad energy range, by looking for bursts over a range of timescales and
energies that are compatible with being powerful flares from extragalactic
magnetars. We followed up the as-yet nearest extragalactic FRB source at a mere
149 Mpc distance, the periodic repeater FRB180916.J0158+65, during the active
phase on February 4-7, 2020, with the Insight-Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope
(HXMT). Taking advantage of the combination of broad band, large effective
area, and several independent detectors available, we searched for bursts over
a set of timescales from 1 ms to 1.024 s with a sensitive algorithm, that had
previously been characterised and optimised. Moreover, through simulations we
studied the sensitivity of our technique in the released energy-duration phase
space for a set of synthetic flares and assuming different energy spectra. We
constrain the possible occurrence of flares in the 1-100 keV energy band to
E<10^46 erg for durations <0.1 s over several tens of ks exposure. We can rule
out the occurrence of giant flares similar to the ones that were observed in
the few cases of Galactic magnetars. The absence of reported radio activity
during our observations does not allow us to make any statements on the
possible simultaneous high-energy emission.

in E-Commerce. It leads to a great demand on automatic review-driven QA, which
aims at providing instant responses towards user-posted questions based on
diverse product reviews. Nevertheless, the rich information about personal
opinions in product reviews, which is essential to answer those
product-specific questions, is underutilized in current generation-based
review-driven QA studies. There are two main challenges when exploiting the
opinion information from the reviews to facilitate the opinion-aware answer
generation: (i) jointly modeling opinionated and interrelated information
between the question and reviews to capture important information for answer
generation, (ii) aggregating diverse opinion information to uncover the common
opinion towards the given question. In this paper, we tackle opinion-aware
answer generation by jointly learning answer generation and opinion mining
tasks with a unified model. Two kinds of opinion fusion strategies, namely,
static and dynamic fusion, are proposed to distill and aggregate important
opinion information learned from the opinion mining task into the answer
generation process. Then a multi-view pointer-generator network is employed to
generate opinion-aware answers for a given product-related question.
Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance in
real-world E-Commerce QA datasets, and effectively generate opinionated and

find that for small amplitudes of Stokes and pump pulses, the population
transfer is mainly achieved directly through the counterdiabatic pulse, while
for large amplitudes the conventional STIRAP path dominates. This kind of
""hedging"" leads to a remarkable robustness against dissipation in the lossy
intermediate state. For small pulse amplitudes and increasing noise correlation
time the performance is decreased, since the dominant counterdiabatic pulse is
affected more, while for large pulse amplitudes, where the STIRAP path
dominates, the efficiency is degraded more for intermediate correlation times
(compared to the pulse duration). For the Gaussian superadiabatic STIRAP
protocol we also investigate the effect of delay between pump and Stokes pulses
and find that under the presence of noise the performance is improved for
increasing delay. We conclude that the Gaussian protocol with suitably chosen

conditions. The present work is expected to have a broad spectrum of
applications, since STIRAP has a crucial role in modern quantum technology.

function to preserve identification of SR images. The identity loss function
compares feature distributions between SR images and their ground truth to
recover identities in SR images. In addition, we provide a

discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretizations of scalar hyperbolic problems. To
ensure that each cell average satisfies a local discrete maximum principle
(DMP), we impose inequality constraints on the local Lax-Friedrichs fluxes of a
piecewise-linear (P1) approximation. Since the piecewise-constant (P0) version
corresponds to a property-preserving low-order finite volume method, the
validity of DMP conditions can always be enforced using slope and/or flux
limiters. We show that the (currently rather uncommon) use of direct flux
limiting makes it possible to construct more accurate DMP-satisfying
approximations in which a weak form of slope limiting is used to prevent
unbounded growth of solution gradients. Moreover, both fluxes and slopes can be
limited in a manner which produces nonlinear problems with well-defined
residuals even at steady state. We derive/present slope limiters based on
different kinds of inequality constraints, discuss their properties and
introduce new anisotropic limiters for problems that require different
treatment of different space directions. At the flux limiting stage, the
anisotropy of the problem at hand can be taken into account by using a
customized definition of local bounds for the DMP constraints. At the slope
limiting stage, we adjust the magnitude of individual directional derivatives
using low-order reconstructions from cell averages to define the bounds. In
this way, we avoid unnecessary limiting of well-resolved derivatives at smooth
peaks and in internal/boundary layers. The properties of selected algorithms
are explored in numerical studies for DG-P1 discretizations of two-dimensional
test problems. In the context of hp-adaptive DG methods, the new limiting
procedures can be used in P1 subcells of macroelements marked as `troubled' by

feature representation of speech utterances, namely, the i-vector model. As a
first step toward this goal, we compare and contrast uniqueness measures
proposed for different biometric modalities. Then, we introduce a new
uniqueness measure that evaluates the entropy of i-vectors while taking into
account speaker level variations. Our measure operates in the discrete feature
space and relies on accurate estimation of the distribution of i-vectors.
Therefore, i-vectors are quantized while ensuring that both the quantized and
original representations yield similar speaker verification performance.
Uniqueness estimates are obtained from two newly generated datasets and the
public VoxCeleb dataset. The first custom dataset contains more than one and a
half million speech samples of 20,741 speakers obtained from TEDx Talks videos.
The second one includes over twenty one thousand speech samples from 1,595
actors that are extracted from movie dialogues. Using this data, we analyzed
how several factors, such as the number of speakers, number of samples per
speaker, sample durations, and diversity of utterances affect uniqueness
estimates. Most notably, we determine that the discretization of i-vectors does
not cause a reduction in speaker recognition performance. Our results show that
the degree of distinctiveness offered by i-vector-based representation may
reach 43-70 bits considering 5-second long speech samples; however, under less
constrained variations in speech, uniqueness estimates are found to reduce by
around 30 bits. We also find that doubling the sample duration increases the
distinctiveness of the i-vector representation by around 20 bits.

(VAD) has made fruitful progress via deep neural network (DNN). However,

They suffer from two gaps: (1) They cannot localize video activities in a both
precise and comprehensive manner. (2) They lack sufficient abilities to utilize
high-level semantics and temporal context information. Inspired by
frequently-used cloze test in language study, we propose a brand-new VAD
solution named Video Event Completion (VEC) to bridge gaps above: First, we
propose a novel pipeline to achieve both precise and comprehensive enclosure of
video activities. Appearance and motion are exploited as mutually complimentary
cues to localize regions of interest (RoIs). A normalized spatio-temporal cube
(STC) is built from each RoI as a video event, which lays the foundation of VEC
and serves as a basic processing unit. Second, we encourage DNN to capture
high-level semantics by solving a visual cloze test. To build such a visual
cloze test, a certain patch of STC is erased to yield an incomplete event (IE).
The DNN learns to restore the original video event from the IE by inferring the
missing patch. Third, to incorporate richer motion dynamics, another DNN is
trained to infer erased patches' optical flow. Finally, two ensemble strategies
using different types of IE and modalities are proposed to boost VAD
performance, so as to fully exploit the temporal context and modality
information for VAD. VEC can consistently outperform state-of-the-art methods
by a notable margin (typically 1.5%-5% AUROC) on commonly-used VAD benchmarks.

between them. Existing approaches completely ignore this solution multiplicity.
In this paper, we argue that being oblivious to the presence of multiple

fold. First, we formally define the task of learning one-of-many solutions for
combinatorial problems in structured output spaces, which is applicable for
solving several problems of interest such as N-Queens, and Sudoku. Second, we
present a generic learning framework that adapts an existing prediction network
for a combinatorial problem to handle solution multiplicity. Our framework uses
a selection module, whose goal is to dynamically determine, for every input,
the solution that is most effective for training the network parameters in any
given learning iteration. We propose an RL based approach to jointly train the
selection module with the prediction network. Experiments on three different
domains, and using two different prediction networks, demonstrate that our
framework significantly improves the accuracy in our setting, obtaining up to

robust methods when studying the effects of a single risk factor on an outcome.
However, there are few pleiotropy robust methods in the multivariable setting,
that is, when there are multiple risk factors of interest. In this paper we
introduce three methods which build on common approaches in the univariable
setting: MVMR-Robust; MVMR-Median; and MVMR-Lasso. We discuss the properties of
each of these methods and examine their performance in comparison to existing
approaches in a simulation study. MVMR-Robust is shown to outperform existing
outlier robust approaches when there are low levels of pleiotropy. MVMR-Lasso
provides the best estimation in terms of mean squared error for moderate to
high levels of pleiotropy, and can provide valid inference in a three sample
setting. MVMR-Median performs well in terms of estimation across all scenarios
considered, and provides valid inference up to a moderate level of pleiotropy.

for machine learning and predictive analysis. After exploring many feature
selection methods, we observe a computational dilemma: 1) traditional feature
selection methods (e.g., mRMR) are mostly efficient, but difficult to identify
the best subset; 2) the emerging reinforced feature selection methods
automatically navigate feature space to explore the best subset, but are
usually inefficient. Are automation and efficiency always apart from each
other? Can we bridge the gap between effectiveness and efficiency under
automation? Motivated by such a computational dilemma, this study is to develop
a novel feature space navigation method. To that end, we propose an Interactive
Reinforced Feature Selection (IRFS) framework that guides agents by not just
self-exploration experience, but also diverse external skilled trainers to
accelerate learning for feature exploration. Specifically, we formulate the
feature selection problem into an interactive reinforcement learning framework.
In this framework, we first model two trainers skilled at different searching
strategies: (1) KBest based trainer; (2) Decision Tree based trainer. We then
develop two strategies: (1) to identify assertive and hesitant agents to
diversify agent training, and (2) to enable the two trainers to take the
teaching role in different stages to fuse the experiences of the trainers and
diversify teaching process. Such a hybrid teaching strategy can help agents to
learn broader knowledge, and, thereafter, be more effective. Finally, we
present extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the
improved performances of our method: more efficient than existing reinforced
selection and more effective than classic selection.

depth information images provided by a Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor. Our method
uses two CNNs. The first one uses raw depth and intensity images as input, to
segment the floor pixels, from which the extrinsic parameters of the camera are
estimated. The second CNN is in charge of segmenting the object-of-interest. As
a main innovation, it exploits the calibration estimated from the prediction of
the first CNN to represent the geometric depth information in a coordinate
system that is attached to the ground, and is thus independent of the camera
elevation. In practice, both the height of pixels with respect to the ground,
and the orientation of normals to the point cloud are provided as input to the
second CNN. Given the segmentation predicted by the second CNN, the object is
localized based on point cloud alignment with a reference model. Our
experiments demonstrate that our proposed two-step approach improves
segmentation and localization accuracy by a significant margin compared to a
conventional CNN architecture, ignoring calibration and height maps, but also
compared to PointNet++.

T), but they lose their magnetization in the presence of alternating (or
ripple) transverse magnetic fields, due to the dynamic magneto-resistance. This
demagnetization is a major concern for applications requiring high run times,
such as motors and generators, where ripple fields are of high amplitude and
frequency. We have developed a numerical model based on dynamic
magneto-resistance that is much faster than the conventional
Power-Law-resistivity model, enabling us to simulate high number of cycles with
the same accuracy. We simulate demagnetization behavior of superconducting
stacks made of 10-100 tapes for up to 2 million cycles of applied ripple field.
We found that for high number of cycles, the trapped field reaches non-zero
stationary values for both superconducting bulks and stacks; as long as the
ripple field amplitudes are below the parallel penetration field, being
determined by the penetration field for a single tape in stacks. Bulks keep
substantial stationary values for much higher ripple field amplitudes than the
stacks, being relevant for high number of cycles. However, for low number of
cycles, stacks lose much less magnetization as compared to bulks.

range of Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks. Deep Learning has not only
pushed the state of the art in several existing NLG tasks but has also
facilitated researchers to explore various newer NLG tasks such as image
captioning. Such rapid progress in NLG has necessitated the development of
accurate automatic evaluation metrics that would allow us to track the progress
in the field of NLG. However, unlike classification tasks, automatically
evaluating NLG systems in itself is a huge challenge. Several works have shown
that early heuristic-based metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE are inadequate for
capturing the nuances in the different NLG tasks. The expanding number of NLG
models and the shortcomings of the current metrics has led to a rapid surge in
the number of evaluation metrics proposed since 2014. Moreover, various
evaluation metrics have shifted from using pre-determined heuristic-based
formulae to trained transformer models. This rapid change in a relatively short
time has led to the need for a survey of the existing NLG metrics to help
existing and new researchers to quickly come up to speed with the developments
that have happened in NLG evaluation in the last few years. Through this

effect on macro- and microscopic elastic properties of glassy solids. We study
several broadly-applicable dimensionless measures of stability and mechanical
disorder in simple computer glasses, in which the relative strength of
attractive interactions -- referred to as `glass stickiness' -- can be readily
tuned. We show that increasing glass stickiness can result in the decrease of
various quantifiers of mechanical disorder, on both macro- and microscopic
scales, with a pair of intriguing exceptions to this rule. Interestingly, in
some cases strong attractions can lead to a reduction of the number density of
soft, quasilocalized modes, by up to an order of magnitude, and to a
substantial decrease in their core size, similar to the effects of thermal
annealing on elasticity observed in recent works. Contrary to the behavior of
canonical glass models, we provide compelling evidence indicating that the
stabilization mechanism in our sticky-sphere glasses stems predominantly from
the self-organized depletion of interactions featuring large, \emph{negative}
stiffnesses. Finally, we establish a fundamental link between macroscopic and
microscopic quantifiers of mechanical disorder, which we motivate via scaling
arguments. Future research directions are discussed.

globe. Even after taking massive protective measures like nation-wide
lockdowns, discontinuation of international flight services, rigorous testing
etc., the infection spreading is still growing steadily, causing thousands of
deaths and serious socio-economic crisis. Thus, the identification of the major
factors of this infection spreading dynamics is becoming crucial to minimize
impact and lifetime of COVID-19 and any future pandemic. In this work, a
probabilistic cellular automata based method has been employed to model the
infection dynamics for a significant number of different countries. This study
proposes that for an accurate data-driven modeling of this infection spread,
cellular automata provides an excellent platform, with a sequential genetic
algorithm for efficiently estimating the parameters of the dynamics. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to understand and interpret
COVID-19 data using optimized cellular automata, through genetic algorithm. It
has been demonstrated that the proposed methodology can be flexible and robust
at the same time, and can be used to model the daily active cases, total number
of infected people and total death cases through systematic parameter
estimation. Elaborate analyses for COVID-19 statistics of forty countries from
different continents have been performed, with markedly divergent time
evolution of the infection spreading because of demographic and socioeconomic
factors. The substantial predictive power of this model has been established
with conclusions on the key players in this pandemic dynamics.

momentum, have recently been observed in copper oxide based high T$_\textrm{c}$
superconductors (cuprates). A charge density modulation or wave is also
ubiquitously found in underdoped cuprates. Within a general mean-field one-band
model we show that the coexistence of charge density waves and uniform
superconductivity in $d$-wave superconductors like cuprates, generates an
odd-frequency spin-singlet pair density wave, in addition to the even-frequency
counterparts. The strength of the induced odd-frequency pair density wave
depends on the modulation wave vector of the charge density wave, with the
odd-frequency pair density waves even becoming comparable to the even-frequency
ones in parts of the Brillouin zone. We show that a change in the modulation
wave vector of the charge density wave from bi-axial to uni-axial, can enhance
the odd-frequency component of the pair density waves. Such a coexistence of
superconductivity and uni-axial charge density wave has already been
experimentally verified at high magnetic fields in underdoped cuprates. We
further discuss the possibility of an odd-frequency spin-triplet pair density
wave generated in the coexistence regime of superconductivity and spin density
waves, applicable to the iron-based superconductors. Our work thus presents a
route to bulk odd-frequency superconductivity in high T$_c$ superconductors.

small, highly discriminative subset of the original feature set. In many
applications, the dataset may have thousands of features and only a few dozens
of samples (sometimes termed `wide'). This study is a cautionary tale
demonstrating why feature selection in such cases may lead to undesirable
results. In view to highlight the sample size issue, we derive the required
sample size for declaring two features different. Using an example, we
illustrate the heavy dependency between feature set and classifier, which poses
a question to classifier-agnostic feature selection methods. However, the
choice of a good selector-classifier pair is hampered by the low correlation
between estimated and true error rate, as illustrated by another example. While
previous studies raising similar issues validate their message with mostly
synthetic data, here we carried out an experiment with 20 real datasets. We
created an exaggerated scenario whereby we cut a very small portion of the data
(10 instances per class) for feature selection and used the rest of the data
for testing. The results reinforce the caution and suggest that it may be
better to refrain from feature selection from very wide datasets rather than
return misleading output to the user.

unreliable for excited states owing, in part, to the absence of a derivative
discontinuity in the xc energy ($\Delta$), which relates a many-electron energy
difference to the corresponding KS energy difference. We demonstrate,
analytically and numerically, how the relationship between KS and many-electron
energies leads to the step structures observed in the exact xc potential, in
four scenarios: electron addition, molecular dissociation, excitation of a
finite system, and charge transfer. We further show that steps in the potential
can be obtained also with common xc approximations, as simple as the LDA, when
addressed from the ensemble perspective. The article therefore highlights how
capturing the relationship between KS and many-electron energies with advanced
xc approximations is crucial for accurately calculating excitations, as well as
the ground-state density and energy of systems which consist of distinct
subsystems.

take multiple effects into account and provide information about the affected
regions. In this study, we develop a deep learning method that is suited to
identify anomalies and provide an image quality assessment of solar full-disk
H$\alpha$ filtergrams. The approach is based on the structural appearance and
the true image distribution of high-quality observations. We employ a neural
network with an encoder-decoder architecture to perform an identity
transformation of selected high-quality observations. The encoder network is
used to achieve a compressed representation of the input data, which is
reconstructed to the original by the decoder. We use adversarial training to
recover truncated information based on the high-quality image distribution.
When images with reduced quality are transformed, the reconstruction of unknown
features (e.g., clouds, contrails, partial occultation) shows deviations from
the original. This difference is used to quantify the quality of the
observations and to identify the affected regions. We apply our method to
full-disk H$\alpha$ filtergrams from Kanzelh\""ohe Observatory recorded during
2012-2019 and demonstrate its capability to perform a reliable image quality
assessment for various atmospheric conditions and instrumental effects, without
the requirement of reference observations. Our quality metric achieves an

SBP operator into an equivalent conservative finite volume form, we were able
to design a low order scheme directly with the LGL nodes that is compatible to
the discrete entropy analysis used for the proof of the entropy stable DGSEM.
Furthermore, we present a hybrid low order/high order discretisation where it
is possible to seamlessly blend between the two approaches, while still being
provably entropy stable. We are able to extend the approach to three spatial
dimensions on unstructured curvilinear hexahedral meshes. We validate our
theoretical findings and demonstrate convergence order for smooth problems,
conservation of the primary quantities and discrete entropy stability for an
arbitrary blending on curvilinear grids. In practical simulations, we connect
the blending factor to a local troubled element indicator that provides the
control of the amount of low order dissipation injected into the high order
scheme. We modified an existing shock indicator, which is based on the modal
polynomial representation, to our provably stable hybrid scheme. The aim is to
reduce the impact of the parameters as good as possible. We describe our

hybrid scheme, as it is possible to compute all the different test cases

reflection setup, forward and backward facing steps with shock Mach numbers up

the joint optimization yielded a further significant WER reduction. The

(DGMs) may be used to enforce the solution to display highly structured spatial
patterns which are supported by independent information (e.g. the geological
setting) of the subsurface. In such case, inversion may be formulated in a
latent space where a low-dimensional parameterization of the patterns is
defined and where Markov chain Monte Carlo or gradient-based methods may be
applied. However, the generative mapping between the latent and the original
(pixel) representations is usually highly nonlinear which may cause some
difficulties for inversion, especially for gradient-based methods. In this
contribution we review the conceptual framework of inversion with DGMs and
study the principal causes of the nonlinearity of the generative mapping. As a
result, we identify a conflict between two goals: the accuracy of the generated
patterns and the feasibility of gradient-based inversion. In addition, we show
how some of the training parameters of a variational autoencoder, which is a
particular instance of a DGM, may be chosen so that a tradeoff between these
two goals is achieved and acceptable inversion results are obtained with a
stochastic gradient-descent scheme. A test case using truth models with channel
patterns of different complexity and cross-borehole traveltime tomographic data
involving both a linear and a nonlinear forward operator is used to assess the

nonlinear equations. It is caused by unexpected linearization of a target
nonlinear equation due to too small of a perturbation added to an exact
solution used for accuracy verification. To clarify the mechanism, we begin
with a proof that the UMUSCL scheme is third-order accurate only for linear
equations. Then, we derive a condition under which the third-order truncation
error dominates the second-order error and demonstrate it numerically for
Burgers' equation. Similar results are shown for the Euler equations, which
disprove some accuracy verification results in the literature. To be genuinely
third-order, UMUSCL must be implemented with flux reconstruction.

frequently misaligned. We aim to test the robustness of the Hale (1994) results
by reanalysing the sample of visual binaries with measured rotation periods

analysis is based on a combination of data from Hale (1994) and newly obtained
spectroscopic data from the Hertzsprung SONG telescope, combined with
astrometric data from Gaia DR2 and the Washington Double Star Catalog. We
combine measurements of stellar radii and rotation periods to obtain stellar
rotational velocities $v$. Rotational velocities $v$ are combined with
measurements of projected rotational velocities $v\sin i$ to derive posterior
probability distributions of stellar inclination angles $i$. We determine
line-of-sight projected spin-orbit angles by comparing stellar inclination
angles with astrometric orbital inclination angles. We find that the precision
of the available data is insufficient to make inferences about the spin-orbit
alignment of visual binaries. The data are equally compatible with alignment
and misalignment at all orbital separations. We conclude that the previously
reported trend that binaries with separations $a < 30$ au are preferentially
aligned is spurious. The spin-orbit alignment distribution of visual binaries
is unconstrained. Based on simulated observations, we predict that it will be
difficult to reach the sufficient precision in $v\sin i$, rotation periods, and
orbital inclination required to make robust statistical inferences about the

predictions of bulk, macroscopic motion. By inverting the process-e.g., drawing
on astrophysical observations-an understanding of relativistic features can
lead to insight into physics on the microscopic scale. Relativistic fluids have
been used to model systems as ""small"" as colliding heavy ions in laboratory
experiments, and as large as the Universe itself, with ""intermediate"" sized

review is to discuss the mathematical and theoretical physics underpinnings of
the relativistic (multi-) fluid model. We focus on the variational principle
approach championed by Brandon Carter and collaborators, in which a crucial
element is to distinguish the momenta that are conjugate to the particle number

conservation laws and the equations of motion in detail, and provide a number
of (in our opinion) interesting and relevant applications of the general

electromagnetism, superfluidity and elasticity-all of which are relevant for

the dominance of the non-thermal jet over the thermal accretion disc component.

to increase gradually towards longer wavelengths in both, however, found to be

Few objects showed a bluer when brighter (BWB) trend, while in some objects

important for many applications, cannot be modeled this way.
  We introduce new variant of budgeted uncertainty sets, called locally

(EFTs) for Nambu-Goldstone (NG) bosons, possessing a set of redundant,
coordinate-dependent symmetries. Similarly to the relativistic case, such EFTs
are natural candidates for ""exceptional"" theories, whose scattering amplitudes
feature an enhanced soft limit, that is, scale with a higher power of momentum
at long wavelengths than expected based on the mere presence of Adler's zero.
The starting point of our framework is the assumption of invariance under
spacetime translations and spatial rotations. The setup is nevertheless general
enough to accommodate a variety of nontrivial kinematical algebras, including
the Poincare, Galilei (or Bargmann) and Carroll algebras. Our main result is an
explicit construction of the nonrelativistic versions of two infinite classes
of exceptional theories: the multi-Galileon and the multi-flavor
Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theories. In both cases, we uncover novel Wess-Zumino
terms, not present in their relativistic counterparts, realizing nontrivially
the shift symmetries acting on the NG fields. We demonstrate how the symmetries
of the Galileon and DBI theories can be made compatible with a nonrelativistic,
quadratic dispersion relation of (some of) the NG modes.

umklapp scattering, where interactions are mediated by the transfer of momenta
to or from the lattice in the neighbouring layer. Using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy to study a graphene on InSe heterostructure, we
present evidence that interlayer umklapp processes can cause hybridization
between bands from neighbouring layers in regions of the Brillouin zone where
bands from only one layer are expected, despite no evidence for moir/'e-induced
replica bands. This phenomenon manifests itself as 'ghost' anti-crossings in
the InSe electronic dispersion. Applied to a range of suitable 2DM pairs, this

using contrast agents. One of the reasons is that many imaging modalities, as
the ones related to medical sciences, suffer from several shortcomings. The
most serious one is the issue of instability. Indeed, it is, nowadays, a common
certainty that classical inverse problems of recovering objects from remote
measurements are, mostly, highly unstable. To recover the stability, it is
advised to create, whenever possible, the missing contrasts in the targets to
image. In this survey paper, we follow this direction and propose an approach
how to analyze mathematically the effect of the injected agents on the
different fields under consideration. These contrast agents are small-sized
particles modeled with materials that enjoy high contrasts as compared to the
ones of the background. These two properties allow them, under critical scales
of size/contrast, to create local spots when excited from far. These local
spots can be remotely recovered in stable ways. The accessible information on
the target are encoded in theses spots.
  After stating a class of such imaging modalities that enter into this
framework, as the acoustic imaging, photo-acoustic imaging, optical imaging and
more, we provide detailed analysis for first two modalities where the contrast
agents are micro-bubbles and nano-particles respectively.

three-year spectroscopically-confirmed cosmological sample, obtaining
photometry in a series of ""local"" apertures centred on the SN, and for the

SN Ia parameters including Hubble residuals. We find all Hubble residual steps
to be $>3\sigma$ in significance, both for splitting at the traditional
environmental property sample median and for the step of maximum significance.
For stellar mass, we find a maximal local step of $0.098\pm0.018$ mag; $\sim
0.03$ mag greater than the largest global stellar mass step in our sample

monopole, quadrupole, and hexadecapole contributions. We then show that
foreground subtraction effects can lead to severe biases in the determination

constructing a 2-parameter foreground modelling prescription, and find that our
prescription leads to unbiased parameter estimation at the expense of
increasing the estimated uncertainties on cosmological parameters. In addition,
we confirm that instrumental and foreground removal effects significantly
impact the theoretical covariance matrix, and cause the covariance between
different multipoles to become non-negligible. Finally, we show the effect of
including higher-order multipoles in our analysis, and how these can be used to
investigate the presence of instrumental and systematic effects in HI intensity

(ABA) signals, which are generated through a train dynamics model with flexible
wheelsets. The proposed feature extraction method is applied to extract the
root mean square distribution of decomposed ABA signals on a balanced binary
tree as orthogonal energy features using the Hilbert transform and wavelet
packet decomposition. The neural network-based defect prediction model is
created to define the relationship between input features and output labels.
For insufficient input features, data augmentation is performed by the linear
interpolation of existing features. The performance of defect prediction is
evaluated in terms of the accuracy of detection and localization and improved
by augmented input features and highly decomposed ABA signals. The results show
that the trained neural network can predict the height and location of a single

field is well known. However, for various applications in coding theory and
cryptography, we usually need to apply automorphisms defined over a finite
field. Although we believe that the automorphism group of an elliptic curve
over a finite field is well known in the community, we could not find this in
the literature. Nevertheless, in this paper we show the group structure of the
automorphism group of an elliptic curve over a finite field. More importantly,
we characterize subgroups and abelian subgroups of the automorphism group of an
elliptic curve over a finite field.
  Despite of theoretical interest on this topic, our research is largely
motivated by constructions of optimal locally repairable codes. The first
research to make use of automorphism group of function fields to construct
optimal locally repairable codes was given in a paper \cite{JMX20} where
automorphism group of a projective line was employed. The idea was further
generated to an elliptic curve in \cite{MX19} where only automorphisms fixing
the point at infinity were used. Because there are at most $24$ automorphisms
of an elliptic curve fixing the point at infinity, the locality of optimal
locally repairable codes from this construction is upper bounded by $23$. One
of the main motivation to study subgroups and abelian subgroups of the
automorphism group of an elliptic curve over a finite field is to remove the
constraints on locality.

nights on the CFHT, we reconstruct the surface brightness and large-scale
magnetic field of V530 Per using the Zeeman-Doppler imaging method, assuming an
oblate stellar surface. We also estimate the short term evolution of the
brightness distribution through latitudinal differential rotation. Using the
same data set, we finally map the spatial distribution of prominences through
tomography of the H\alpha emission. The brightness map is dominated by a large,
dark spot near the pole, accompanied by a complex distribution of bright and
dark features at lower latitudes. The magnetic field map is reconstructed as
well, most of the large-scale magnetic field energy is stored in the toroidal
field component. The main radial field structure is a positive region of about
500 G, at the location of the dark polar spot. The brightness map of V530 Per
is sheared by solar-like differential rotation, with a roughly solar value for
the difference in rotation rate between the pole and equator. \halpha~is
observed in emission, and is mostly modulated by the stellar rotation period.
The prominence system is organized in a ring at the approximate location of the
co-rotation radius, with significant evolution between the two observing
nights. V530 Per is the first example of a solar-type star to have its surface
magnetic field and prominences mapped together, which will bring important
observational constraints to better understand the role of slingshot

offer advice based on the social information available in prior users'
aggregated activity. When designing these applications, is it better to offer:
a) advice that if strictly adhered to is more likely to result in an individual
successfully achieving their goal, even if fewer users will choose to adopt it?
or b) advice that is likely to be adopted by a larger number of users, but
which is sub-optimal with regard to any particular individual achieving their
goal? We identify this dilemma, characterized as Goal-Directed vs.
Adoption-Directed advice, and investigate the design questions it raises
through an online experiment undertaken in four advice domains (financial
investment, making healthier lifestyle choices, route planning, training for a
5k run), with three user types, and across two levels of uncertainty. We report
findings that suggest a preference for advice favoring individual goal
attainment over higher user adoption rates, albeit with significant variation
across advice domains; and discuss their design implications.

important channels for information dissemination. However, these social media
platforms are often misused to spread rumors, which has brought about severe
social problems, and consequently, there are urgent needs for automatic rumor
detection techniques. Existing work on rumor detection concentrates more on the
utilization of textual features, but diffusion structure itself can provide
critical propagating information in identifying rumors. Previous works which
have considered structural information, only utilize limited propagation
structures. Moreover, few related research has considered the dynamic evolution
of diffusion structures. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a
Neural Model using Dynamic Propagation Structures (NM-DPS) for rumor detection
in social media. Firstly, we propose a partition approach to model the dynamic
evolution of propagation structure and then use temporal attention based neural
model to learn a representation for the dynamic structure. Finally, we fuse the
structure representation and content features into a unified framework for
effective rumor detection. Experimental results on two real-world social media

that a periodic driving of the double well with suitably tuned amplitude and

prohibitively large in the undriven double well for the considered atomic

of NOON states through this protocol experimentally feasible. Resonance- and

of the anomalies: the discrepancy between the theoretical prediction on the

isospin-conserving re-scattering $\Lambda\rho\to\Sigma\pi$. Taking into account
of the effects induced by the final state interaction, we re-evaluate the
relevant quantities. Our numerical results indicate that the new theoretical
prediction based on this scenario involving an interference between the direct
transition of $\Lambda_c\to\Sigma\pi$ and the portal
$\Lambda_c\to\Lambda\rho\to\Sigma\pi$ can make both the decay rate and sign of

differences enhancing viral attachment rates. We find a small cluster of
mutations which show that CoV-2 has a new feature that promotes much stronger
viral attachment and enhances contagiousness. The extremely dangerous dynamics

questions in polynomial optimization. These include the questions of (i)
finding a local minimum, (ii) testing local minimality of a point, and (iii)
deciding attainment of the optimal value. Our results characterize the
complexity of these three questions for all degrees of the defining polynomials
left open by prior literature.
  Regarding (i) and (ii), we show that unless P=NP, there cannot be a
polynomial-time algorithm that finds a point within Euclidean distance $c^n$
(for any constant $c$) of a local minimum of an $n$-variate quadratic program.
By contrast, we show that a local minimum of a cubic polynomial can be found
efficiently by semidefinite programming (SDP). We prove that second-order
points of cubic polynomials admit an efficient semidefinite representation,
even though their critical points are NP-hard to find. We also give an
efficiently-checkable necessary and sufficient condition for local minimality
of a point for a cubic polynomial.
  Regarding (iii), we prove that testing whether a quadratically constrained
quadratic program with a finite optimal value has an optimal solution is
NP-hard. We also show that testing coercivity of the objective function,
compactness of the feasible set, and the Archimedean property associated with
the description of the feasible set are all NP-hard. We also give a new
characterization of coercive polynomials that lends itself to a hierarchy of
SDPs.
  In our final chapter, we present an SDP relaxation for finding approximate
Nash equilibria in bimatrix games. We show that for a symmetric game, a
$1/3$-Nash equilibrium can be efficiently recovered from any rank-2 solution to
this relaxation. We also propose SDP relaxations for NP-hard problems related
to Nash equilibria, such as that of finding the highest achievable welfare
under any Nash equilibrium.

multi-region removal sampling model that shares information across species and
parks to enable inference on rare species and sparsely sampled parks and to
evaluate the effects of local forest structure. Trends in bird abundance over
time varied widely across parks, but species showed similar trends within
parks. Three parks (Acadia, Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller, and Morristown)
decreased in bird abundance across all species, while three parks (Saratoga,
Roosevelt-Vanderbilt, and Weir-Farm) increased in abundance. Bird abundance
peaked at medium levels of basal area and high levels of percent forest and
forest regeneration, with percent forest having the largest effect. Variation
in these effects across parks could be a result of differences in forest
structural stage and diversity. Our novel hierarchical model enables estimates
of abundance at the network, park, guild, and species levels. We found large
variation in abundance trends across parks but not across bird guilds,
suggesting that local forest condition may have a broad and consistent effect
on the entire bird community within a given park. Management should target the
three parks with overall decreasing trends in bird abundance to further
identify what specific factors are driving observed declines across the bird
community. Understanding how bird communities respond to local forest structure

Can one obtain all homomorphisms $G \to H$, starting from one homomorphism $f$,

  This paper focuses on a generalization of $k$-colourings, namely
$(p,q)$-circular colourings. We show that when $2 < \frac{p}{q} < 4$, a graph
$G$ is $(p,q)$-mixing if and only if for any $(p,q)$-colouring $f$ of $G$, and
any cycle $C$ of $G$, the wind of the cycle under the colouring equals a
particular value (which intuitively corresponds to having no wind). As a
consequence we show that $(p,q)$-mixing is closed under a restricted
homomorphism called a fold. Using this, we deduce that $(2k+1,k)$-mixing is
co-NP-complete for all $k \in \mathbb{N}$, and by similar ideas we show that if
the circular chromatic number of a connected graph $G$ is $\frac{2k+1}{k}$,
then $G$ folds to $C_{2k+1}$. We use the characterization to settle a
conjecture of Brewster and Noel, specifically that the circular mixing number
of bipartite graphs is $2$. Lastly, we give a polynomial time algorithm for
$(p,q)$-mixing in planar graphs when $3 \leq \frac{p}{q} <4$.

research over the last few years. Caches have been an outstanding covert
channel, as they provide high resolution and generic cross-core leakage even
with simple user-mode code execution privileges. To prevent these generic
cross-core attacks, all major cryptographic libraries now provide
countermeasures to hinder key extraction via cross-core cache attacks, for
instance avoiding secret dependent access patterns and prefetching data. In
this paper, we show that implementations protected by 'good-enough'
countermeasures aimed at preventing simple cache attacks are still vulnerable.
We present a novel attack that uses a special timing technique to determine
when an encryption has started and then evict the data precisely at the desired
instant. This new attack does not require special privileges nor explicit
synchronization between the attacker and the victim. One key improvement of our
attack is a method to evict data from the cache with a single memory access and
in absence of shared memory by leveraging the transient capabilities of TSX and
relying on the recently reverse-engineered L3 replacement policy. We
demonstrate the efficiency by performing an asynchronous last level cache
attack to extract an RSA key from the latest wolfSSL library, which has been
especially adapted to avoid leaky access patterns, and by extracting an AES key
from the S-Box implementation included in OpenSSL bypassing the per round
prefetch intended as a protection against cache attacks.

Their normal states all show metallic behavior. The key player here is the FeSe
layer which exhibits the highest superconducting transition temperature in the
form of monolayer thin film. Recently a new FeSe based compound, CsFe4-xSe4
with the space group of Bmmm was found. Interestingly the system shows a strong
insulator-like behavior although it shares the same FeSe planes as other
relatives. Density functional theory calculations indicate that it should be a
metal, in sharp contrast with the experimental observations. Here we report the
emergence of unconventional superconductivity by applying pressure to suppress
this insulator-like behavior. At ambient pressure, the insulator-like behavior
cannot be modeled as a band insulator, but can be described by the
variable-range-hopping model for correlated systems. Furthermore, the specific
heat down to 400 mK has been measured and a significant residual coefficient
gamma_0=C/T|T->0 is observed, which contrasts the insulator-like state and
suggests some quantum freedom of spin dynamics. By applying pressure the
insulator-like behavior is gradually suppressed and the system becomes a metal,
finally superconductivity is achieved at about 5.1 K. The superconducting
transition strongly depends on magnetic field and applied current, indicating a
fragile superfluid density. Our results suggest that the superconductivity is
established by diluted Cooper pairs on top of a strong correlation background
in CsFe4-xSe4.

However, OSN image privacy itself is quite complicated, and solutions currently
in place for privacy management in reality are insufficient to provide
personalized, accurate and flexible privacy protection. A more intelligent
environment for privacy-friendly OSN image sharing is in demand. To fill the
gap, we contribute a survey of ""privacy intelligence"" that targets modern
privacy issues in dynamic OSN image sharing from a user-centric perspective.
Specifically, we present a definition and a taxonomy of OSN image privacy, and
a high-level privacy analysis framework based on the lifecycle of OSN image
sharing. The framework consists of three stages with different principles of
privacy by design. At each stage, we identify typical user behaviors in OSN
image sharing and the privacy issues associated with these behaviors. Then a
systematic review on the representative intelligent solutions targeting those
privacy issues is conducted, also in a stage-based manner. The resulting
analysis describes an intelligent privacy firewall for closed-loop privacy
management. We also discuss the challenges and future directions in this area.

existence of three neutrino flavors, standard big bang nucleosynthesis is a
parameter-free model. It is important to assess if the observed primordial
abundances can be reproduced by simulations. Numerous studies have shown that
the simulations overpredict the primordial $^7$Li abundance by a factor of
$\approx$ $3$ compared to the observations. The discrepancy may be caused by
unknown systematics in $^7$Li observations, poorly understood depletion of
lithium in stars, errors in thermonuclear rates that take part in the lithium
and beryllium synthesis, or physics beyond the standard model. Here, we focus
on the likelihood of a nuclear physics solution. The status of the key nuclear
reaction rates is summarized. Big bang nucleosynthesis simulations are
performed with the most recent reaction rates and the uncertainties of the
predicted abundances are established using a Monte Carlo technique.
Correlations between abundances and reaction rates are investigated based on
the metric of mutual information. The rates of four reactions impact the
primordial $^7$Li abundance: $^3$He($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^7$Be,
d(p,$\gamma$)$^3$He, $^7$Be(d,p)2$\alpha$, and $^7$Be(n,p)$^7$Li. We employ a
genetic algorithm to search for simultaneous rate changes in these four
reactions that may account for all observed primordial abundances. When the
search is performed for reaction rate ranges that are much wider than recently
reported uncertainties, no acceptable solutions are found. Based on the
currently available evidence, we conclude that it is highly unlikely for the
cosmological lithium problem to have a nuclear physics solution.

scales, primarily by the observations of the anisotropies in the cosmic
microwave background (CMB). Over the last few years, it has been recognized
that a sharp rise in power on small scales will lead to enhanced formation of
primordial black holes (PBHs) and also generate secondary gravitational waves
(GWs) of higher and, possibly, detectable amplitudes. It is well understood
that scalar power spectra with COBE normalized amplitude on the CMB scales and
enhanced amplitudes on smaller scales can be generated due to deviations from
slow roll in single, canonical scalar field models of inflation. In fact, an
epoch of so-called ultra slow roll inflation can lead to the desired
amplification. We find that scenarios that lead to ultra slow roll can be
broadly classified into two types, one wherein there is a brief departure from
inflation (a scenario referred to as punctuated inflation) and another wherein
such a departure does not arise. We consider a set of single field inflationary
models involving the canonical scalar field that lead to ultra slow roll and
punctuated inflation and examine the formation of PBHs as well as the
generation of secondary GWs in these models. Apart from considering specific
models, we reconstruct potentials from certain functional choices of the first
slow roll parameter leading to ultra slow roll and punctuated inflation and
investigate their observational signatures. In addition to the secondary tensor
power spectrum, we calculate the secondary tensor bispectrum in the equilateral
limit in these scenarios. Moreover, we calculate the inflationary scalar
bispectrum that arises in all the cases and discuss the imprints of the scalar
non-Gaussianities on the extent of PBHs formed and the amplitude of the
secondary GWs.

person image to target poses. These tasks require spatial manipulation of
source data. However, Convolutional Neural Networks are limited by the lack of
ability to spatially transform the inputs. In this paper, we propose a
differentiable global-flow local-attention framework to reassemble the inputs
at the feature level. This framework first estimates global flow fields between
sources and targets. Then, corresponding local source feature patches are
sampled with content-aware local attention coefficients. We show that our
framework can spatially transform the inputs in an efficient manner. Meanwhile,
we further model the temporal consistency for the person image animation task
to generate coherent videos. The experiment results of both image generation
and animation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model. Besides,
additional results of novel view synthesis and face image animation show that
our model is applicable to other tasks requiring spatial transformation. The

pulsars are typically longer than 100 seconds. It is considered that the
interaction between the strong magnetic field of neutron star and the wind

  In this study, we follow the spin evolution of NS, taking into account the
interaction between the magnetic field and wind matter. In this line, as new
challenges, we solve the evolution of the magnetic field of the neutron star at
the same time, and additionally we focus on the effects of wind properties of
the donor. As the result, evolutionary tracks were obtained in which the
neutron star spends some duration in the ejector phase after birth, then
rapidly spins down, becomes quasi-equilibrium, and gradually spins up. Such
evolution is similar to previous studies, but we found that its dominant
physics depends on the velocity of the donor wind. When the wind velocity is
fast, the spin-down occurs due to magnetic inhibition, while the classical
propeller effect and settling accretion shell causes rapid spin-down in the
slow wind accretion. Since the wind velocity of the donor could depend on the
irradiated X-ray luminosity, the spin evolution track of the neutron star in
wind-fed HMXB could be more complicated than considered.

experiment---is set to significantly advance the sensitivity of CMB
measurements and enhance our understanding of the origin and evolution of the
Universe, from the highest energies at the dawn of time through the growth of
structure to the present day. Among the science cases pursued with CMB-S4, the
quest for detecting primordial gravitational waves is a central driver of the
experimental design. This work details the development of a forecasting
framework that includes a power-spectrum-based semi-analytic projection tool,
targeted explicitly towards optimizing constraints on the tensor-to-scalar
ratio, $r$, in the presence of Galactic foregrounds and gravitational lensing
of the CMB. This framework is unique in its direct use of information from the
achieved performance of current Stage 2--3 CMB experiments to robustly forecast
the science reach of upcoming CMB-polarization endeavors. The methodology
allows for rapid iteration over experimental configurations and offers a
flexible way to optimize the design of future experiments given a desired
scientific goal. To form a closed-loop process, we couple this semi-analytic
tool with map-based validation studies, which allow for the injection of
additional complexity and verification of our forecasts with several
independent analysis methods. We document multiple rounds of forecasts for
CMB-S4 using this process and the resulting establishment of the current
reference design of the primordial gravitational-wave component of the Stage-4
experiment, optimized to achieve our science goals of detecting primordial
gravitational waves for $r > 0.003$ at greater than $5\sigma$, or, in the
absence of a detection, of reaching an upper limit of $r < 0.001$ at $95\%$ CL.

calculus to the modeling of nonlocal solids. The reformulation of nonlocal
fractional-order continuum mechanic framework, by means of VO kinematics,
enables a unique approach to the modeling of solids exhibiting
position-dependent nonlocal behavior. The frame-invariance of the strain tensor
is leveraged to identify constraints on the definition of the VO. The VO
nonlocal continuum formulation is then applied to model the response of
Euler-Bernoulli type beams whose governing equations are derived in strong form
by means of variational principles. The VO formulation is shown to be
self-adjoint and positive-definite, which ensure that the governing equations
are well-posed and free from boundary effects. These characteristics stand in
contrast to classical integral approaches to nonlocal elasticity, where it is
not always possible to obtain positive-definite and self-adjoint systems. A key
step in promoting the use of VO approaches is to identify methodologies to
determine the VO describing a given physical system. This study presents a deep
learning based framework capable of solving the inverse problem consisting in
the identification of the VO describing the behavior of the nonlocal beam on
the basis of its response. It is established that the internal architecture of
bidirectional recurrent neural networks makes them suitable for nonlocal
boundary value problems, similar to the one treated in this study. Results show
that the network accurately solves the inverse problem even for nonlocal beams
with VO patterns inconsistent with the network training data set. Although
presented in the context of a 1D Euler-Bernoulli beam, both the VO nonlocal
formulation and the deep learning techniques are very general and could be
extended to the solution of any general higher-dimensional VO boundary value
problem.

meaningful and practical in healthcare. Existing work mainly relies on the
strong ignorability assumption that no hidden confounders exist, which may lead
to bias in estimating causal effects. Some studies consider the hidden
confounders are designed for static environment and not easily adaptable to a
dynamic setting. In fact, most observational data (e.g., electronic medical
records) is naturally dynamic and consists of sequential information. In this
paper, we propose Deep Sequential Weighting (DSW) for estimating ITE with
time-varying confounders. Specifically, DSW infers the hidden confounders by
incorporating the current treatment assignments and historical information
using a deep recurrent weighting neural network. The learned representations of
hidden confounders combined with current observed data are leveraged for
potential outcome and treatment predictions. We compute the time-varying
inverse probabilities of treatment for re-weighting the population. We conduct
comprehensive comparison experiments on fully-synthetic, semi-synthetic and
real-world datasets to evaluate the performance of our model and baselines.
Results demonstrate that our model can generate unbiased and accurate treatment
effect by conditioning both time-varying observed and hidden confounders,
paving the way for personalized medicine.

its practical use in AI safety. Compared with the white-box attack, a black-box
setting is more difficult for less available information related to the
attacked model and the additional constraint on the query budget. A general way
to improve the attack efficiency is to draw support from a pre-trained
transferable white-box model. In this paper, we propose a novel setting of
transferable black-box attack: attackers may use external information from a
pre-trained model with available network parameters, however, different from
previous studies, no additional training data is permitted to further change or
tune the pre-trained model. To this end, we further propose a new algorithm,
EigenBA to tackle this problem. Our method aims to explore more gradient
information of the black-box model, and promote the attack efficiency, while
keeping the perturbation to the original attacked image small, by leveraging
the Jacobian matrix of the pre-trained white-box model. We show the optimal
perturbations are closely related to the right singular vectors of the Jacobian
matrix. Further experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 show that even the
unlearnable pre-trained white-box model could also significantly boost the
efficiency of the black-box attack and our proposed method could further
improve the attack efficiency.

Therefore, it is always best advised to collect as much evidence as possible to
be certain about the diagnosis. Unfortunately, in the case of the Brugada
Syndrome (BrS), a rare and inherited heart disease, only one diagnostic
criterion exists, namely, a typical pattern in the Electrocardiogram (ECG). In
the following treatise, we question whether the investigation of ECG strips by
the means of machine learning methods improves the detection of BrS positive
cases and hence, the diagnostic process. We propose a pipeline that reads in
scanned images of ECGs, and transforms the encaptured signals to digital
time-voltage data after several processing steps. Then, we present a long
short-term memory (LSTM) classifier that is built based on the previously
extracted data and that makes the diagnosis. The proposed pipeline
distinguishes between three major types of ECG images and recreates each
recorded lead signal. Features and quality are retained during the digitization
of the data, albeit some encountered issues are not fully removed (Part I).
Nevertheless, the results of the aforesaid program are suitable for further
investigation of the ECG by a computational method such as the proposed
classifier which proves the concept and could be the architectural basis for
future research (Part II). This thesis is divided into two parts as they are
part of the same process but conceptually different. It is hoped that this work
builds a new foundation for computational investigations in the case of the BrS
and its diagnosis.

leverages stability-based relative clustering validation methods to determine
best clustering solutions as the ones that best generalize to unseen data.
Statistical software, both in R and Python, usually rely on internal validation
metrics, such as silhouette, to select the number of clusters that best fits
the data. Meanwhile, open-source software solutions that easily implement
relative clustering techniques are lacking. Internal validation methods exploit
characteristics of the data itself to produce a result, whereas relative
approaches attempt to leverage the unknown underlying distribution of data
points looking for generalizable and replicable results. The implementation of
relative validation methods can further the theory of clustering by enriching
the already available methods that can be used to investigate clustering
results in different situations and for different data distributions. This work
aims at contributing to this effort by developing a stability-based method that
selects the best clustering solution as the one that replicates, via supervised
learning, on unseen subsets of data. The package works with multiple clustering
and classification algorithms, hence allowing both the automatization of the
labeling process and the assessment of the stability of different clustering
mechanisms.

characterization of local thermal properties in small scale. For some important
applications such as lithium-ion batteries, changes in the properties during
the operation makes the analysis even more challenging, necessitating a rapid
characterization. We propose a new method to characterize the thermal
properties of particulate composites based on actual micro-images. Our
computer-vision-based approach constructs 3D images from stacks of 2D SEM
images and then extracts several representative elemental volumes (REVs) from
the reconstructed images at random places, which leads to having a range of
geometrical features for different REVs. A deep learning algorithm is designed
based on convolutional neural nets to take the shape of the geometry and result
in the effective conductivity of the REV. The training of the network is
performed in two methods: First, based on implementing a coarser grid that uses
the average values of conductivities from the fine grid and the resulted
effective conductivity from the DNS solution of the fine grid. The other method
uses conductivity values on cross sections from each REV in different
directions. The results of training based on averaging show that using a
coarser grid in the network does not have a meaningful effect on the network
error; however, it decreases the training time up to three orders of magnitude.
We showed that one general network can make accurate predictions using
different types of electrode images, representing the difference in the
geometry and constituents. Moreover, training based on averaging is more
accurate than training based on cross sections. The study of the robustness of
implementing a machine learning technique in predicting the thermal percolation
shows the prediction error is almost half of the error from predictions based
on the volume fraction.

least $\chi^2$-fit method. Encouraged by this first test, we study
systematically during 67 days , 1-2 weeks new data and predict the contaminated
persons for the coming week. We find that the first month data are well
described by a linear or quadratic polynomial with an increase of about (4-5)
infected persons per day. Pursuing the analysis, one note that data until 46
days favour a cubic polynomial behaviour which signals an eventual near future
stronger growth as confirmed by the new data on the 48th day. We complete the
analysis until 67 days and find that the data until 77 days confirm the cubic
polynomial behaviour which is a remarkable feature of the pandemic spread in
Madagascar. We expect that these results will be useful for some new model
buildings. A comparison with some other SI-like models predictions is
done.These results may also be interpreted as the lowest values of the real
case due to the insufficient number of samples (12907 for 27 million habitants
