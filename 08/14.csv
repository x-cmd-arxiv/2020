known to propagate, from any noncritical singular point, along singular
characteristics which are curves satisfying certain differential inclusions. In
the literature, different notions of singular characteristics were introduced.
However, a general uniqueness criterion for singular characteristics, not
restricted to mechanical systems or problems in one space dimension, is missing
at the moment. In this paper, we prove that, for a Tonelli Hamiltonian on
$\mathbb{R}^2$, two different notions of singular characteristics coincide up
to a bi-Lipschitz reparameterization. As a significant consequence, we obtain a
uniqueness result for the class of singular characteristics that was introduced

response to an external field which is illustrated by a thin-film standard

not only makes accurate prediction of the time steps possible, but also
decisively reduces complexity in the learning process where magnetization
states from simulated micromagnetic dynamics associated with different external

principal components to describe the states between time predictions. The
method is capable of handling large training sample sets owing to a low-rank
approximation of the kernel matrix and an associated low-rank extension of
kernel principal component analysis and kernel ridge regression. The approach
entirely shifts computations into a reduced dimensional setting breaking down
the problem dimension from the thousands to the tens.

air quality parameters as inputs and predicts the following 14-day hourly

been discovered so far. However, identifying their progenitors has remained an
outstanding open question in astrophysics. Studies of SN host galaxies have
proven to be powerful in providing constraints on the progenitor populations.
In this paper, we present all CCSNe detected between 2009 and 2017 by the
Palomar Transient Factory. This sample includes 888 SNe of 12 distinct classes
out to redshift $z\approx1$. We present the photometric properties of their
host galaxies from the far-ultraviolet to the mid-infrared and model the
host-galaxy spectral energy distributions to derive physical properties. The
galaxy mass functions of Type Ic, Ib, IIb, II, and IIn SNe ranges from $10^{5}$
to $10^{11.5}~M_\odot$, probing the entire mass range of star-forming galaxies
down to the least-massive star-forming galaxies known. Moreover, the galaxy
mass distributions are consistent with models of star-formation-weighted mass
functions. Regular CCSNe are hence direct tracers of star formation. Small but
notable differences exist between some of the SN classes. Type Ib/c SNe prefer
galaxies with slightly higher masses (i.e., higher metallicities) and
star-formation rates than Type IIb and II SNe. These differences are less
pronounced than previously thought. H-poor SLSNe and SNe~Ic-BL are scarce in
galaxies above $10^{10}~M_\odot$. Their progenitors require environments with
metallicities of $<0.4$ and $<1$ solar, respectively. In addition, the hosts of
H-poor SLSNe are dominated by a younger stellar population than all other
classes of CCSNe. Our findings corroborate the notion that low-metallicity
\textit{and} young age play an important role in the formation of SLSN
progenitors.

third (the $k^2$ term for higher derivative bias) set to zero. The agreement is
typically at the 2 percent level over scales of interest, which is the
statistical uncertainty of our simulation measurements. To achieve this level
of agreement, our {\it fiducial} model requires using the full non-linear
matter power spectrum (rather than the 1-loop PT one). We also measure the
relationship between the non-linear and linear bias parameters and compare them
to their expected co-evolution values. We use these tests to motivate the

leading-edge comb on owl feathers and the special design of its barbs,
resembling a cascade of complex 3D-curved thin finlets. The details of the
geometry of the barbs from an owl feather were used to design a generic model
of the comb for experimental and numerical flow studies with the comb attached
to the leading edge of a flat plate. Examination was carried out at different
sweep angles, because life animal clearly show the backward sweep of the wing
during gliding and flapping. The results demonstrate a flow turning effect in
the boundary layer inboards, which extends along the chord over distances of
multiples of the barb lengths. The inboard flow-turning effect described here,
thus, counter-acts the outboard directed cross-span flow typically appearing
for backward swept wings. From recent theoretical studies on a swept wing, such
a way of turning the flow in the boundary layer is known to attenuate crossflow
instabilities and delay transition. A comparison of the comb-induced cross-span
velocity profiles with those proven to delay transition in theory shows
excellent agreement, which supports the laminar flow control hypothesis. Thus,
the observed effect is expected to delay transition in owl flight, contributing
to a more silent flight

demand for masks that meet medical or workplace standards can prevent most
individuals or organizations from obtaining suitable protection. Cloth masks
are widely believed to impede droplet and aerosol transmission but most are
constructed from materials with unknown filtration efficiency, airflow
resistance and water resistance. Further, there has been no clear guidance on
the most important performance metrics for the materials used by the general
public (as opposed to high-risk healthcare settings). Here we provide data on a
range of common fabrics that might be used to construct masks. None of the
materials were suitable for masks meeting the N95 NIOSH standard, but many
could provide useful filtration (>90%) of 3 micron particles (a plausible
challenge size for human generated aerosols), with low pressure drop. These
were: nonwoven sterile wraps, dried baby wipes and some double-knit cotton
materials. Decontamination of N95 masks using isopropyl alcohol produces the
expected increase in particle penetration, but for 3 micron particles,
filtration efficiency is still well above 95%. Tightly woven thin fabrics,
despite having the visual appearance of a good particle barrier, had remarkably
low filtration efficiency and high pressure drop. These differences in
filtration performance can be partly explained by the material structure; the
better structures expose individual fibers to the flow while the poor materials
may have small fundamental fibers but these are in tightly bundled yarns. The
fit and use of the whole mask are critical factors not addressed in this work.
Despite the complexity of the design of a very good mask, it is clear that for

fermiology is similar to the bulk limit of the nickelates, the NiO$_2$

the effect of absence of rare-earth atoms on the crystal field splitting.
Contrary to the bulk Fermi surfaces, there are two Ni-$3d$ Fermi pockets,
giving rise to enhanced spectral weight around the $\bar{\text{M}}$ point in
the surface Brillouin zone. From a strong-coupling analysis, we obtain dominant
extended $s$-wave superconductivity for the surface layer, as opposed to
$d$-wave for the bulk. This finding distinguishes the nickelates from

late-type galaxies, with stellar masses $9\le \log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot}) \le

galaxies in these two environments which includes the comparison of the
metallicity as a function of the radius, at a characteristic scale, and as a
function of a the stellar mass surface density. We find significant differences
between group and field late-type galaxies in terms of their metallicity, in
the sense that group galaxies are systematically more metallic than their field
counterparts. We find that field galaxies have, in general, metallicity
profiles that show a negative gradient in their inner regions, and a shallower
profile at larger radii. This contrasts with the metallicity profiles of
galaxies in groups, which tend to be flat in the inner regions, and to have a
negative gradient in the outer parts. Regarding the metallicity at the
characteristic radius of the luminosity profiles, we consistently find that it
is higher for group galaxies irrespective of galaxy mass. At fixed local
stellar surface mass density, group galaxies are again more metallic, also the
dependence of metallicity on surface density is less important for group
galaxies. The evidence of a clear difference on the metallicity of group and
field galaxies, as a function of mass, spatial scale, and local stellar mass
density, are indicative of the different evolutionary paths that galaxies in
groups and in the field have followed. We discuss possible implications of the

switch over from the different production rates but it is mandatory to
switch-off when the inventory process reaches the storage maximum capacity. We
consider holding, production, shortage penalty and switching costs. This model
was introduced by Doshi, Van Der Duyn Schouten and Talman in 1978. Our aim is
to minimize the expected discounted cumulative costs up to infinity over all
admissible switching strategies. We show that the optimal cost functions for
the different production rates satisfy the corresponding
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system of equations in a viscosity sense and prove a
verification theorem. The way in which the optimal cost functions solve the
different variational inequalities gives the switching regions of the optimal
strategy, hence it is stationary in the sense that depends only on the current
production rate and inventory level. We define the notion of finite band
strategies and derive, using scale functions, the formulas for the different

Pearl described a thought-experiment as a way to motivate the PDE. Analysis of
this experiment led Robins \& Richardson to a novel way of conceptualizing
direct effects in terms of interventions on an expanded graph in which
treatment is decomposed into multiple separable components. We further develop
this novel theory here, showing that it provides a self-contained framework for
discussing mediation without reference to cross-world (nested) counterfactuals
or interventions on the mediator. The theory preserves the dictum `no causation
without manipulation' and makes questions of mediation empirically testable in
future Randomized Controlled Trials. Even so, we prove the interventionist and
nested counterfactual approaches remain tightly coupled under a Non-Parametric

fact, our analysis also leads to a simple sound and complete algorithm for

simulate the outputs of the self-driving vehicle's perception and prediction

outputs to train a model that predicts what the online system will produce.
Importantly, the inputs to our system consists of high definition maps,
bounding boxes, and trajectories, which can be easily sketched by a test

verification which learns a regularized metric to compare facial features.
Differently from popular methods such as FaceNet, the proposed approach does
not impose any specific metric on facial features; instead, it shapes the
decision space by learning a latent representation in which matching and
non-matching pairs are mapped onto clearly separated and well-behaved target
distributions. In particular, the network jointly learns the best feature
representation, and the best metric that follows the target distributions, to
be used to discriminate face images. In this paper we present this general
framework, first of its kind for facial verification, and tailor it to Gaussian
distributions. This choice enables the use of a simple linear decision boundary
that can be tuned to achieve the desired trade-off between false alarm and
genuine acceptance rate, and leads to a loss function that can be written in
closed form. Extensive analysis and experimentation on publicly available
datasets such as Labeled Faces in the wild (LFW), Youtube faces (YTF),
Celebrities in Frontal-Profile in the Wild (CFP), and challenging datasets like
cross-age LFW (CALFW), cross-pose LFW (CPLFW), In-the-wild Age Dataset (AgeDB)

The proposed multi-mask self-supervised learning via data undersampling (SSDU)
applies a hold-out masking operation on acquired measurements to split it into
multiple pairs of disjoint sets for each training sample, while using one of
these pairs for DC units and the other for defining loss, thereby more
efficiently using the undersampled data. Multi-mask SSDU is applied on
fully-sampled 3D knee and prospectively undersampled 3D brain MRI datasets, for
various acceleration rates and patterns, and compared to CG-SENSE and
single-mask SSDU DL-MRI, as well as supervised DL-MRI when fully-sampled data
is available. Results on knee MRI show that the proposed multi-mask SSDU
outperforms SSDU and performs closely with supervised DL-MRI. A clinical reader
study further ranks the multi-mask SSDU higher than supervised DL-MRI in terms
of SNR and aliasing artifacts. Results on brain MRI show that multi-mask SSDU
achieves better reconstruction quality compared to SSDU. Reader study
demonstrates that multi-mask SSDU at R=8 significantly improves reconstruction

address the role of Tetracycline as an inhibitor for the receptor-binding
domain (RBD) of the spike protein. Targeted molecular investigation show that
Tetracycline binds more favorably to the RBD (-9.40 kcal/mol) compared to
Chloroquine (-6.31 kcal/mol) or Doxycycline (-8.08 kcal/mol) and inhibits
attachment to ACE2 to a greater degree (binding efficiency of 2.98

Stronger Tetracycline inhibition is verified with nonequilibrium PMF
calculations, for which the Tetracycline-RBD complex exhibits the lowest free
energy profile along the dissociation pathway from ACE2. Tetracycline appears
to target viral residues that are usually involved in significant hydrogen
bonding with ACE2; this inhibition of cellular infection complements the
anti-inflammatory and cytokine suppressing capability of Tetracycline, and may

cannot readily explain other kinds of models that do not use or need
classification-like loss functions (e.g., similarity models trained with a
metric learning loss). In this work, we bridge this crucial gap, presenting a
method to generate gradient-based visual attention for image similarity
predictors. By relying solely on the learned feature embedding, we show that
our approach can be applied to any kind of CNN-based similarity architecture,
an important step towards generic visual explainability. We show that our
resulting attention maps serve more than just interpretability; they can be
infused into the model learning process itself with new trainable constraints.
We show that the resulting similarity models perform, and can be visually
explained, better than the corresponding baseline models trained without these

parameter $\nu = -q - q^{-1}$ (at least in the generic case, i.e., when $q$ is

$n$-fold tensor product module are in one-to-one correspondence with those of
the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This double-commutant property is referred to as
quantum Schur-Weyl duality.
  In this article, we investigate such a duality in great detail. We prove that
the commutant of the $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-action on any generic type-one
tensor product module is isomorphic to a diagram algebra that we call the
valenced Temperley-Lieb algebra TL$_\varsigma(\nu)$. This corresponds to
representations with higher spin, which results in the need of valences (or
colors) in the Temperley-Lieb diagrams. We establish detailed direct-sum
decompositions exhibiting this duality and find explicit bases amenable to
concrete calculations, important in applications. We also include a
double-commutant type property for homomorphisms between different
$U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-modules, realized by valenced diagrams. The diagram
calculus is reminiscent to Kauffman's recoupling theory and the graphical
methods developed among others by Penrose and Frenkel \& Khovanov. The results
also contain the standard quantum Schur-Weyl duality as a special case, and
when specialized to $q \rightarrow 1$, imply the classical Frobenius-Schur-Weyl

differentiate between the contributions from star formation, AGN accretion, and
jets, we have observed a nearby sample of Seyfert galaxies along with a
comparison sample of starburst galaxies using the EVLA in full-polarization
mode in the B-array configuration. The radio morphologies of the Seyfert
galaxies show lobe/bubble-like features or prominent cores in radio emission
whereas the starburst galaxies show radio emission spatially coincident with
the star-forming regions seen in optical images. There is tentative evidence
that Seyferts tend to show more polarized structures than starburst galaxies at
the resolution of our observations. We find that unlike a sample of Seyfert
galaxies hosting kilo-parsec scale radio (KSR) emission, starburst galaxies
with superwinds do not show radio-excess compared to the radio-FIR correlation.
This suggests that shock acceleration is not adequate to explain the excess
radio emission seen in Seyferts and hence most likely have a jet-related
origin. We also find that the [O III] luminosity of the Seyferts is correlated
with the off-nuclear radio emission from the lobes, whereas it is not well
correlated with the total emission which also includes the core. This suggests
strong jet-medium interaction, which in turn limits the jet/lobe extents in

meta-RL) problem setting and proposes an algorithm that performs well in this

learning strategy of pre-training a model on a large batch of fixed,
pre-collected data (possibly from various tasks) and fine-tuning the model to a
new task with relatively little data. That is, in offline meta-RL, we
meta-train on fixed, pre-collected data from several tasks in order to adapt to
a new task with a very small amount (less than 5 trajectories) of data from the
new task. By nature of being offline, algorithms for offline meta-RL can
utilize the largest possible pool of training data available and eliminate
potentially unsafe or costly data collection during meta-training. This setting
inherits the challenges of offline RL, but it differs significantly because
offline RL does not generally consider a) transfer to new tasks or b) limited
data from the test task, both of which we face in offline meta-RL. Targeting
the offline meta-RL setting, we propose Meta-Actor Critic with Advantage
Weighting (MACAW), an optimization-based meta-learning algorithm that uses
simple, supervised regression objectives for both the inner and outer loop of
meta-training. On offline variants of common meta-RL benchmarks, we empirically
find that this approach enables fully offline meta-reinforcement learning and
achieves notable gains over prior methods.

cost function as a Hamiltonian on spin degrees of freedom and simulate the
relaxation of the system to a low energy configuration using local update rules

analysis, we here investigate performance in practice through benchmarking
experiments on instances of the MAXCUT problem.Through heuristic arguments we
propose formulas for choosing the hyperparameters of the algorithm which are
found to be in good agreement with the optimal choices determined from

gradient descent on a relaxation of maxcut to continuous variables, but
consistently outperforms gradient descent in all instances tested. We find time
to solution achieved by the local tensor method is highly uncorrelated with
that achieved by a widely used commercial optimization package; on some MAXCUT
instances the local tensor method beats the commercial solver in time to
solution by up to two orders of magnitude and vice-versa. Finally, we argue

agree within the uncertainties with the normal of the Great Plane of Andromeda

fixing the self-energy to that of the equilibrium configuration is in many

escape fraction is crucial for determining how the Universe became reionized,
but the neutral intergalactic medium precludes direct measurement of the escape
fraction at high-redshifts. Indirect estimates of the escape fraction must
describe how the Universe was reionized. Here, we present new Keck Cosmic Web
Imager spatially-resolved spectroscopy of the resonant Mg II 2800 doublet from
a redshift 0.36 galaxy, J1503+3644, with a previously observed escape fraction
of 6%. The Mg II emission has a similar spatial extent as the stellar
continuum, and each of the Mg II doublet lines are well-fit by single
Gaussians. The Mg II is optically thin. The intrinsic flux ratio of the red and
blue Mg II emission line doublet, $R = F_{2796}/F_{2803}$, is set by atomic
physics to be two, but Mg$^+$ gas along the line of sight decreases $R$
proportional to the Mg II optical depth. Combined with the metallicity, $R$
estimates the neutral gas column density. The observed $R$ ranges across the
galaxy from 0.8-2.7, implying a factor of 2 spatial variation of the relative
escape fraction. All of the ionizing photons that escape J1503+3644 pass

consistently shorter than the lifetime measured in neutron beam experiments.
With trapping potentials as low as 50 neV and neutron detectors located only at
the top of the bottle, this discrepancy could be the result of the soft
scattering of dark matter with neutrons. However, it is challenging to obtain
the observed loss rate in conventional models of dark matter scattering. We
show that this phenomenology is possible in composite models of dark matter
where the soft scattering is from dark matter that has been captured and
accumulated in the earth. This solution can be tested by placing more neutron
detectors around the trap, providing better angular coverage. The phenomenology
of soft scattering by trapped composite dark matter is generic and suggests new
experimental directions that could be pursued to detect this large class of
models.

together with inherent processing simplicity. However, when the impact of
hardware distortions are considered, such relays suffer from a
distortion-amplification loop, due to the inter-dependent nature of the relay
transmit signal covariance and the residual self-interference covariance. The
aforementioned behavior leads to a significant performance degradation for a
system with a low or medium hardware accuracy. In this work, we analyse the
relay transfer function as well as the Mean Squared-Error (MSE) performance of
an FD-AF MIMO relaying communication, under the impact of collective sources of
additive and multiplicative transmit and receive impairments. Building on the
performed analysis, an optimization problem is devised to minimize the
communication MSE and solved by employing the recently proposed Penalty Dual

point of the original problem via a sequence of convex quadratic programs
(CQP)s, thereby enjoying an acceptable arithmatic complexity as the problem
dimensions grow large. Numerical simulations verify the significance of the

$W$, $Z$, and Higgs bosons, it is possible to approximately (though not

train a supervised learning method to create boson jets. Such a method much
operates on individual particles and identifies connections between particles

well-suited for this purpose as they can act on unordered sets and naturally
create strong connections between particles with the same label. These networks

winds as functions of stellar parameters like luminosity and metallicity. We
use newly developed steady-state models of radiation-driven winds to compute
the global properties of a grid of O-stars. The self-consistent models are
calculated by means of an iterative solution to the equation of motion using
full NLTE radiative transfer in the co-moving frame to compute the radiative

grid covers main-sequence stars, giants and supergiants in the Galaxy and both
Magellanic Clouds. We find a strong dependence of mass-loss on both luminosity
and metallicity. Mean values across the grid are $\dot{M}\sim L_{\ast}^{2.2}$
and $\dot{M}\sim Z_{\ast}^{0.95}$, however we also find a somewhat stronger
dependence on metallicity for lower luminosities. Similarly, the mass
loss-luminosity relation is somewhat steeper for the SMC than for the Galaxy.
In addition, the computed rates are systematically lower (by a factor 2 and
more) than those commonly used in stellar-evolution calculations. Overall, our
results agree well with observations in the Galaxy that account properly for
wind-clumping, with empirical $\dot{M}$ vs. $Z_\ast$ scaling relations, and
with observations of O-dwarfs in the SMC. Our results provide simple fit
relations for mass-loss rates and wind momenta of massive O-stars stars as
functions of luminosity and metallicity, valid in the range $T_{\rm eff} =
28000 - 45000$\,K. Due to the systematically lower $\dot{M}$, our new models
suggest that new rates might be needed in evolution simulations of massive

electromagnetic partner facilities have transformed the modus operandi in which
we seek information about the Universe. The first ever-observed neutron-star
merger---GW170817---confirmed the association of short gamma-ray bursts with
neutron-star mergers and the production of heavy (r-process) elements. Based on
recent theoretical and observational developments, I briefly present and
discuss a conjecture, namely that compact accretion disks in both short and
long gamma-ray bursts synthesize most of the heavy r-process elements in the
Universe. The upcoming era of multi-messenger astronomy may allow us to verify
or falsify this conjecture.

  with Application to Friction",,,"10.1063/5.0025158",,"physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Coulomb collisions in plasmas are typically modeled using the Boltzmann
collision operator, or its variants, which apply to weakly magnetized plasmas
in which the typical gyroradius of particles significantly exceeds the Debye
length. Conversely, O'Neil has developed a kinetic theory to treat plasmas that
are so strongly magnetized that the typical gyroradius of particles is much
smaller than the distance of closest approach in a binary collision. Here, we
develop a generalized collision operator that applies across the full range of
magnetization strength. To demonstrate novel physics associated with strong
magnetization, it is used to compute the friction force on a massive test
charge. In addition to the traditional stopping power component, this is found
to exhibit a transverse component that is perpendicular to both the velocity
and Lorentz force vectors in the strongly magnetized regime, as was predicted
recently using linear response theory. Good agreement is found between the
collision theory and linear response theory in the regime in which both apply,
but the new collision theory also applies to stronger magnetization strength
regimes than the linear response theory is expected to apply in.

persistent hints for oscillations due to an eV-scale sterile neutrino in the
data of various reactor neutrino experiments. The assessment of the statistical
significance of these hints is usually based on Wilks' theorem, whereby the
assumption is made that the log-likelihood is $\chi^2$-distributed. However, it
is well known that the preconditions for the validity of Wilks' theorem are not
fulfilled for neutrino oscillation experiments. In this work we derive a simple
asymptotic form of the actual distribution of the log-likelihood based on
reinterpreting the problem as fitting white Gaussian noise. From this formalism
we show that, even in the absence of a sterile neutrino, the expectation value
for the maximum likelihood estimate of the mixing angle remains non-zero with
attendant large values of the log-likelihood. Our analytical results are then
confirmed by numerical simulations of a toy reactor experiment. Finally, we
apply this framework to the data of the Neutrino-4 experiment and show that the
null hypothesis of no-oscillation is rejected at the 2.6\,$\sigma$ level,
compared to 3.2\,$\sigma$ obtained under the assumption that Wilks' theorem
applies.

satisfy, at once, all desirable features of an universal simulator, namely
long-lived coherence, full control of system parameters, low losses, and

we explore the ballistic propagation of a single-excitation wavefunction in an

(24 - 52 GHz) along with the multi-antenna narrow-beam based directional
transmissions demand a wideband spectrum sensing in temporal as well as spatial
domains. We referred to it as ultra-wideband angular spectrum sensing (UWAS),
and it consists of digitization followed by characterization of the wideband
spectrum. In this paper, we design and develop state-of-the-art UWAS prototype
using USRPs and LabVIEW NXG for the validation in the real-radio environment.
Since 5G is expected to co-exist with LTE, the transmitter generates the
multi-directional multi-user wideband traffic via LTE specific single carrier
frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) approach. At the receiver, the
first step of wideband spectrum digitization is accomplished using a novel
approach of integrating sparse antenna-array with reconfigurable sub-Nyquist
sampling (SNS). The reconfigurable SNS allows the digitization of
non-contiguous spectrum via low-rate analog-to-digital converters, but it needs
intelligence to choose the frequency bands for digitization. We explore the
multi-play multi-armed bandit based learning algorithm to embed intelligence.
Compared to previous works, the proposed characterization (frequency band
status and direction-of-arrival estimation) approach does not need prior
knowledge of received signal distribution. The detailed experimental results
for various spectrum statistics, power gains and antenna array arrangements
along with lower complexity validate the functional correctness, superiority
and feasibility of the proposed UWAS over state-of-the-art approaches.

write on the details of US/PA imaging system implementation and

US/PA imaging system setup, study the performance parameters of the system, and
explain sequencing of the US/PA signal generation and signal amplification as
well as the details required for efficient use of the hardware of the system
and data processing protocols. We focused on linear-array based PAI due to its

sufficiently accelerated motion of charged stars (specially neutron stars) or

decays with missing energy. The Belle II tag-side reconstruction algorithm,
Full Event Interpretation, relies on a hierarchical reconstruction of $B$ meson
decays with multivariate classification employed at each stage of
reconstruction. Given the large numbers of classifiers employed and decay
chains reconstructed, the performance of the algorithm on data and simulation
differs significantly. Here, calibration factors are derived for hadronic
tag-side $B$ decays by measuring a signal side decay, $B \rightarrow X\ell
\nu$, in $34.6$ fb$^{-1}$ of Belle II data. For a very loose selection on the
tag-side $B$ multivariate classifier, the calibration factors are $0.65 \pm
0.02$ and $0.83 \pm 0.03$ for tag-side $B^{+}$ and $B^{0}$ mesons,
respectively.

1d Heisenberg spin-1/2 XXZ chain with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)
and a transverse magnetic field using quantum information measures. Both
longitudinal and transverse DM vectors are considered. Using numerical DMRG, we
compute the one-tangle, two-spin concurrence and the Wigner-Yananse-skew
information. We show that a longitudinal DMI destroys the factorizability
property while a transverse DMI preserves it. We relate the absence of
factorizability to the breaking of the $U(1)$ rotation symmetry about the local
magnetization axis at each lattice site. Physically, breaking of the symmetry
manifests in the existence of a chiral current. Although the longitudinal DMI
destroys factorizability, we obtain a `pseudofactorizing' field ($h_{pf}$) at
which entanglement and hence violation of the $U(1)$ symmetry is minimal. Our
calculations indicate a phase coherent ground state at $h_{pf}$. An
entanglement transition (ET) occurs across this field which is characterized by
an enhanced but finite range of two-spin concurrence in its vicinity in
contrast with the diverging range of the concurrence for the ET across the
factorizing field ($h_{f}$). We relate the asymmetry to the `frameness' or the
ability for the state to act as a reference frame for some measurement. In
absence of longitudinal DMI (or in presence of transverse DMI), at $h_{f}$, the
single site magnetization axis specifies the common $z$-axis for the full
system but not the full Cartesian reference frame due to a lack of phase
reference. On the other hand, in the presence of a longitudinal DMI, our
results indicate that at $h_{pf}$, the local magnetization and the chiral
current are sufficient to specify the full Cartesian reference frame, with the
chiral current being the macroscopic quantity to determine the phase reference.

length is consistent with linear-stability analyses. All other cases are not
adequately described by existing theory. In radial geometries, the onset length
predicted from theory is an order of magnitude smaller than what is
experimentally observed and has the incorrect scaling with dimensionless
numbers. For miscible fluids in a rectilinear geometry the onset length is
related to the development of steady-state structures within the confining
dimension and cannot be explained by quasi-two dimensional theories. By
combining the onset length with the finger growth rate measured after onset,
the global patterns that form well into the late-time dynamics can be
predicted.

to obtain synthetic data that no longer contains sensitive information but

multi-categorical data: a Wassertein GAN with gradient penalty (MC-WGAN-GP), a
conditional tabular GAN (CTGAN) and a Mixed Numerical and Categorical
Differentially Private GAN (MNCDP-GAN). For transparency, the approaches are
illustrated using a public dataset, the French motor third party liability

reproduce the original data structure and predictive models, privacy, and ease

easiest to use, and the MNCDP-GAN guarantees differential privacy.

  to compute Whittle index",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY math.OC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Restless bandits are a class of sequential resource allocation problems
concerned with allocating one or more resources among several alternative
processes where the evolution of the process depends on the resource allocated
to them. Such models capture the fundamental trade-offs between exploration and
exploitation. In 1988, Whittle developed an index heuristic for restless bandit
problems which has emerged as a popular solution approach due to its simplicity
and strong empirical performance. The Whittle index heuristic is applicable if
the model satisfies a technical condition known as indexability. In this paper,
we present two general sufficient conditions for indexability and identify
simpler to verify refinements of these conditions. We then revisit a previously
proposed algorithm called adaptive greedy algorithm which is known to compute
the Whittle index for a subclass of restless bandits. We show that a
generalization of the adaptive greedy algorithm computes the Whittle index for
all indexable restless bandits. We present an efficient implementation of this
algorithm which can compute the Whittle index of a restless bandit with $K$
states in O(K^3) computations. Finally, we present a detailed numerical study
which affirms the strong performance of the Whittle index heuristic.

overwhelm storage capability, communication capability, and computation
capability of the modern machines we design today. As a result, many key
applications' performance, efficiency and scalability are bottlenecked by data
movement. In this keynote talk, we describe three major shortcomings of modern
architectures in terms of 1) dealing with data, 2) taking advantage of the vast
amounts of data, and 3) exploiting different semantic properties of application
data. We argue that an intelligent architecture should be designed to handle
data well. We show that handling data well requires designing architectures
based on three key principles: 1) data-centric, 2) data-driven, 3) data-aware.
We give several examples for how to exploit each of these principles to design
a much more efficient and high performance computing system. We especially
discuss recent research that aims to fundamentally reduce memory latency and
energy, and practically enable computation close to data, with at least two
promising novel directions: 1) performing massively-parallel bulk operations in
memory by exploiting the analog operational properties of memory, with low-cost
changes, 2) exploiting the logic layer in 3D-stacked memory technology in
various ways to accelerate important data-intensive applications. We discuss
how to enable adoption of such fundamentally more intelligent architectures,
which we believe are key to efficiency, performance, and sustainability. We
conclude with some guiding principles for future computing architecture and

interconnected multiphase flow processes. A simple model for the time evolution

of the relevant physical processes. The modeling framework along with detailed

this work. The Galerkin and least-squares Petrov-Galerkin (LSPG) methods are
tested on compressible flows involving a disparity of temporal scales. A novel
calibration strategy is proposed for the LSPG method and two test cases are
analyzed. The first consists of a subsonic airfoil flow where boundary layer
instabilities are responsible for trailing-edge noise generation and the second
comprises a supersonic airfoil flow with a transient period where a detached
shock wave propagates upstream at the same time that shock-vortex interaction
occurs at the trailing edge. Results show that calibration produces stable and
long-time accurate for both cases. In order to reduce the computational costs
of the LSPG models, an accelerated greedy missing point estimation (MPE)
algorithm is employed for hyper-reduction. For the first case investigated,
LSPG solutions obtained with hyper-reduction show good comparison with those
obtained by the full order model. However, for the supersonic case the
transient features of the flow need to be properly captured by the sampled
points. Otherwise, the dynamics of the moving shock wave are not fully
recovered. The impact of different time-marching schemes is also assessed and,
differently than reported in literature, Galerkin models are shown to be more
accurate than those computed by LSPG when the non-conservative form of the
Navier-Stokes equations are solved. For the supersonic case, the Galerkin and
LSPG models (without hyper-reduction) capture the overall dynamics of the
detached and oblique shock waves along the airfoil. However, when shock-vortex
interaction occurs at the trailing-edge, the Galerkin ROM is able to capture
the high-frequency fluctuations from vortex shedding while the LSPG presents a
more dissipative solution, not being able to recover the flow dynamics.

gerrymandering by comparing a proposed redistricting plan with an ensemble of
sampled alternative plans. For successful application, sampling methods must
scale to maps with a moderate or large number of districts, incorporate
realistic legal constraints, and accurately and efficiently sample from a
selected target distribution. Unfortunately, most existing methods struggle in
at least one of these areas. We present a new Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)
algorithm that generates a sample of redistricting plans converging to a
realistic target distribution. Because it draws many plans in parallel, the SMC
algorithm can efficiently explore the relevant space of redistricting plans
better than the existing Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms that
generate plans sequentially. Our algorithm can simultaneously incorporate
several constraints commonly imposed in real-world redistricting problems,
including equal population, compactness, and preservation of administrative
boundaries. We validate the accuracy of the proposed algorithm by using a small
map where all redistricting plans can be enumerated. We then apply the SMC
algorithm to evaluate the partisan implications of several maps submitted by
relevant parties in a recent high-profile redistricting case in the state of
Pennsylvania. We find that the proposed algorithm converges faster and with

imaging and industrial design. In recent years, the realistic and interactive
volume rendering of the global illumination can improve the perception of shape
and depth of volumetric datasets. In this paper, a novel and flexible
performance method of slice-based ray casting is proposed to implement the
volume illumination effects, such as volume shadow and other scattering
effects. This benefits from the slice-based illumination attenuation buffers of
the whole geometry slices at the viewpoint of the light source and the
high-efficiency shadow or scattering coefficient calculation per sample in ray
casting. These tests show the method can obtain much better volume illumination
effects and more scalable performance in contrast to the local volume
illumination in ray casting volume rendering or other similar slice-based

learnability and robustness of SNNs, obtained by a greedy tight force heuristic

variant of PSO). Two groups of experiments are conducted to examine the
learnability and the robustness of SNNs with Sigmoid activation,
learned/optimised by KPI-PDBPs and KPI-VPSOs, where, KPIs (key performance
indicators: error (ERR), accuracy (ACC) and $F_1$ score) are the objectives,
driving the searching process. An incremental approach is applied to examine
the impact of hidden neuron numbers on the performance of SNNs,
learned/optimised by KPI-PDBPs and KPI-VPSOs. From the engineering prospective,
all sensors are well justified for a specific task. Hence, all sensor readings
should be strongly correlated to the target. Therefore, the structure of an SNN
should depend on the dimensions of a problem space. The experimental results
show that the number of hidden neurons up to the dimension number of a problem
space is enough; the learnability of SNNs, produced by KPI-PDBP, is better than
that of SNNs, optimized by KPI-VPSO, regarding the performance and learning
time on the training data sets; the robustness of SNNs learned by KPI-PDBPs and

unknown location and length in the univariate Gaussian sequence model. Recent
results have shown that using scale-dependent critical values for the scan
statistic allows to attain asymptotically optimal detection simultaneously for
all signal lengths, thereby improving on the traditional scan, but this
procedure has been criticized for losing too much power for short signals. We
explain this discrepancy by showing that these asymptotic optimality results
will necessarily be too imprecise to discern the performance of scan statistics
in a practically relevant way, even in a large sample context. Instead, we
propose to assess the performance with a new finite sample criterion. We then
present three calibrations for scan statistics that perform well across a range
of relevant signal lengths: The first calibration uses a particular adjustment
to the critical values and is therefore tailored to the Gaussian case. The
second calibration uses a scale-dependent adjustment to the significance levels
and is therefore applicable to arbitrary known null distributions. The third
calibration restricts the scan to a particular sparse subset of the scan
windows and then applies a weighted Bonferroni adjustment to the corresponding
test statistics. This {\sl Bonferroni scan} is also applicable to arbitrary
null distributions and in addition is very simple to implement. We show how to
apply these calibrations for scanning in a number of distributional settings:
for normal observations with an unknown baseline and a known or unknown
constant variance,for observations from a natural exponential family, for
potentially heteroscadastic observations from a symmetric density by employing
self-normalization in a novel way, and for exchangeable observations using

highly likely to experience line-of-sight (LoS). As such, characterizing the
performance of mixed aerial-terrestrial networks with accurate fading models is
critical to precise network performance characterization and resource
optimization. We first characterize closed-form expressions for a variety of
performance metrics such as frame decoding error probability (referred to as
reliability), outage probability, and ergodic capacity of users. The
terrestrial and aerial transmissions may experience either LoS Rician fading or
NLoS Nakagami-m fading with a certain probability. Based on the derived
expressions, we formulate a hierarchical bi-objective
mixed-integer-nonlinear-programming (MINLP) problem to minimize the total
transmit power of all users and maximize the aggregate throughput of D2D users
subject to quality-of-service (QoS) measures (i.e., reliability and ergodic

closed-form power allocations for each D2D and cellular user on any possible
subchannel, and then incorporate them to devise efficient subchannel and power
allocation algorithms. Complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms is

increasing the throughput of D2D pairs especially for distant D2D pairs.

  Methods: This retrospective study included cine, LGE and T1 mapping scans
from two hospitals. The training set included 2,329 patients and 34,019 images.
A hold-out test set included 531 patients and 7,723 images. CNN models were
developed to detect two mitral valve plane and apical points on long-axis (LAX)
images. On short-axis (SAX) images, anterior and posterior RV insertion points
and LV center were detected. Model outputs were compared to manual labels by
two operators for accuracy with a t-test for statistical significance. The
trained model was deployed to MR scanners.
  Results: For the LAX images, success detection was 99.8% for cine, 99.4% for
LGE. For the SAX, success rate was 96.6%, 97.6% and 98.9% for cine, LGE and
T1-mapping. The L2 distances between model and manual labels were 2 to 3.5 mm,
indicating close agreement between model landmarks to manual labels. No
significant differences were found for the anterior RV insertion angle and LV
length by the models and operators for all views and imaging sequences. Model
inference on MR scanner took 610ms/5.6s on GPU/CPU, respectively, for a typical
cardiac cine series.
  Conclusions: This study developed, validated and deployed a CNN solution for
robust landmark detection in both long and short-axis CMR images for cine, LGE

many transition-metal atoms have small magnetic dipole moments in their

the metastable $a ^5F_5$ state as supporting a $J \rightarrow J+1$ optical
transition with properties similar to the D2 transition of alkali atoms, and
suited for laser cooling. The high total angular momentum and electron spin of
this state suppresses leakage out of the the nearly closed optical transition

this challenge requires exploring and exploiting knowledge of the interaction
process from demonstrations by humans. However, it is unclear what information
(or environmental states) is utilized by the human driver to guide their
behavior throughout the whole merging process. This paper provides quantitative
analysis and evaluation of the merging behavior at highway on-ramps with
congested traffic in a volume of time and space. Two types of social
interaction scenarios are considered based on the social preferences of
surrounding vehicles: courteous and rude. The significant levels of
environmental states for characterizing the interactive merging process are
empirically analyzed based on the real-world INTERACTION dataset. Experimental
results reveal two fundamental mechanisms in the merging process: 1) Human
drivers select different states to make sequential decisions at different
moments of task execution, and 2) the social preference of surrounding vehicles
can impact variable selection for making decisions. It implies that efficient
decision-making design should filter out irrelevant information while
considering social preference to achieve comparable human-level performance.
These essential findings shed light on developing new decision-making
approaches for AVs.

Cosmography (TDCOSMO) lenses, in tension with the H$_0$ from the cosmic
microwave background. However, without assumptions on the radial mass density
profile -- and relying exclusively on stellar kinematics to break the
mass-sheet degeneracy -- the precision drops to 8\% with the current data of
the 7 TDCOSMO lenses, insufficient to resolve the H$_0$ tension. With the
addition of external information from 33 Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) lenses, the
precision improves to 5\%, {\it if} the deflectors of TDCOSMO and SLACS lenses
are drawn from the same population. We investigate the prospects to improve the
precision of time-delay cosmography without relying on mass profile assumptions
to break the mass sheet degeneracy. Our forecasts are based on the hierarchical
framework introduced by Birrer et al. (2020). With existing samples and
technology, 3.3\% precision on H$_0$ can be reached by adding spatially
resolved kinematics of the 7 TDCOSMO lenses. The precision improves to 2.5\%
with the further addition of kinematics for 50 non-time-delay lenses from SLACS

delay and 200 non-time delay lenses will improve the precision to 1.5\% and
1.2\%, respectively. Time-delay cosmography can reach sufficient precision to
resolve the Hubble tension at 3-5$\sigma$, without assumptions on the radial
mass profile of lens galaxies. By obtaining this precision with and without
external datasets, we will test the consistency of the samples and enable
further improvements based on even larger future samples of time delay and

outperform the classical user association algorithms in terms of data rate,

a few eV full width at half maximum (FWHM). Measurements of calorimeter line
shapes are usually dominated by the natural linewidth of most laboratory

statistically sample the instrumental line broadening, and can add systematic
uncertainty if the intrinsic line shape of the source is not well known. To
address these issues, we have built a simple, compact monochromatic x-ray
source using channel cut crystals. A commercial x-ray tube illuminates a pair
of channel cut crystals which are aligned in a dispersive configuration to
select the \kaone line of the x-ray tube anode material. The entire device,
including x-ray tube, can be easily hand carried by one person and may be

monochromatic beam provides a collimated image of the anode spot with
magnification of unity in the dispersion direction (typically 100-200 $\mu$m
for the x-ray tubes used here), and is unfocused in the cross-dispersion
direction, so that the source image in the detector plane appears as a line. We
measured output count rates as high as 10 count/s/pixel for the Hitomi Soft

adaptation approach that automatically switches among multiple controllers,

methods and machine learning. First, we approximate each controller with a
Bernstein-polynomial based hybrid system model under bounded disturbance, and
compute a safe invariant set for each controller based on its corresponding
hybrid system. Intuitively, the invariant set of a controller defines the state
space where the system can always remain safe under its control. The union of
the controllers' invariants sets then define a safe adaptation space that is
larger than (or equal to) that of each controller. Second, we develop a deep
reinforcement learning method to learn a controller switching strategy for
reducing the control/actuation energy cost, while with the help of a safety
guard rule, ensuring that the system stays within the safe space. Experiments
on a linear adaptive cruise control system and a non-linear Van der Pol's
oscillator demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on energy saving and

ground truth images, however, are often unavailable or very expensive to

studied extensively in recent years, many shape-programmable materials,

most industrial sheet materials. In this theoretical work, we consider central
swelling and shrinkage of plates of aspect ratio and material properties
relevant to the manufacture of engineered wood composite panels in which both
in-plane swelling and material stiffness are highly orthotropic, leading to
multiple separations in energy scales. With transverse swelling in the soft
direction, and gradients in the stiff direction, the warped plates adopt two
distinct types of configurations, axisymmetric and twisted, which we illustrate
with toy models. We employ a two-parameter family of isometries to embed the
metric programmed by the swelling, thus reducing the problem to one of
minimizing bending energy alone. A simple argument is seen to closely predict
averaged axisymmetric curvatures. While purely cylindrical shapes are
unobtainable by pure in-plane swelling, they can be closely approximated in a
highly anisotropic system. However, anisotropy can favor twisting, and breaks a
degenerate soft deformation mode associated with minimal surfaces in isotropic
materials. Bifurcations from axisymmetric to twisted shapes can be induced by
anisotropy or by certain attributes of a central shrinkage profile. Finally, we
note how our findings indicate practical limitations on the diagnosis of
moisture inhomogeneities in manufactured panels by observation of warped
conformations, due to the sensitivity of the qualitative response to specifics
of the profile.

organizations to jointly train a model without revealing their private data to
each other. This paper studies {\it vertical} federated learning, which tackles
the scenarios where (i) collaborating organizations own data of the same set of
users but with disjoint features, and (ii) only one organization holds the
labels. We propose Pivot, a novel solution for privacy preserving vertical
decision tree training and prediction, ensuring that no intermediate
information is disclosed other than those the clients have agreed to release
(i.e., the final tree model and the prediction output). Pivot does not rely on
any trusted third party and provides protection against a semi-honest adversary
that may compromise $m-1$ out of $m$ clients. We further identify two privacy
leakages when the trained decision tree model is released in plaintext and
propose an enhanced protocol to mitigate them. The proposed solution can also
be extended to tree ensemble models, e.g., random forest (RF) and gradient
boosting decision tree (GBDT) by treating single decision trees as building
blocks. Theoretical and experimental analysis suggest that Pivot is efficient
for the privacy achieved.

higher-order products such as mosaics, controlled basemaps, and digital
elevation models (DEMs), are of critical importance to NASA, its commercial

component of basic scientific research and sustained planetary exploration and
operations. The Planetary Data System (PDS) is performing the essential job of
archiving and serving these data, mostly in raw or calibrated form, with less
support for higher-order, more ready-to-use products. However, many planetary
spatial data remain not readily accessible to and/or usable by the general
science user because particular skills and tools are necessary to process and
interpret them from the raw initial state. There is a critical need for
planetary spatial data to be more accessible and usable to researchers and
stakeholders. A Planetary Spatial Data Infrastructure (PSDI) is a collection of
data, tools, standards, policies, and the people that use and engage with them.
A PSDI comprises an overarching support system for planetary spatial data.
PSDIs (1) establish effective plans for data acquisition; (2) create and make
available higher-order products; and (3) consider long-term planning for
correct data acquisition, processing and serving (including funding). We
recommend that Planetary Spatial Data Infrastructures be created for all bodies
and key regions in the Solar System. NASA, with guidance from the planetary
science community, should follow established data format standards to build
foundational and framework products and use those to build and apply PDSIs to
all bodies. Establishment of PSDIs is critical in the coming decade for several
locations under active or imminent exploration, and for all others for future
planning and current scientific analysis.

In this work, we present an efficient Processing-in-MRAM Accelerated De Bruijn
Graph based DNA Assembly platform named PANDA based on an optimized and
hardware-friendly genome assembly algorithm. PANDA is able to assemble
large-scale DNA sequence data-set from all-pair overlaps. We first design PANDA
platform that exploits MRAM as a computational memory and converts it to a
potent processing unit for genome assembly. PANDA can execute not only

developed in-memory logic operations. The platform is then configured with a
novel data partitioning and mapping technique that provides local storage and
processing to fully utilize the algorithm-level's parallelism. The cross-layer
simulation results demonstrate that PANDA reduces the run time and power,
respectively, by a factor of 18 and 11 compared with CPU. Besides, speed-ups of

augmentation effect. We further highlight that in DS-FL, the heterogeneity of
the devices' dataset leads to ambiguous of each data sample and lowing of the

where the aggregated model outputs are intentionally sharpened. Moreover,
extensive experiments show that DS-FL reduces communication costs up to 99%

most public ReID datasets are collected in a short time window in which
persons' appearance rarely changes. In real-world applications such as in a
shopping mall, the same person's clothing may change, and different persons may
wearing similar clothes. All these cases can result in an inconsistent ReID
performance, revealing a critical problem that current ReID models heavily rely
on person's apparels. Therefore, it is critical to learn an apparel-invariant
person representation under cases like cloth changing or several persons
wearing similar clothes. In this work, we tackle this problem from the
viewpoint of invariant feature representation learning. The main contributions
of this work are as follows. (1) We propose the semi-supervised
Apparel-invariant Feature Learning (AIFL) framework to learn an
apparel-invariant pedestrian representation using images of the same person
wearing different clothes. (2) To obtain images of the same person wearing
different clothes, we propose an unsupervised apparel-simulation GAN (AS-GAN)
to synthesize cloth changing images according to the target cloth embedding.
It's worth noting that the images used in ReID tasks were cropped from
real-world low-quality CCTV videos, making it more challenging to synthesize
cloth changing images. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets
comparing with several baselines. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposal can improve the ReID performance of the baseline models.

either calculation of susceptibility through multiple orientation sampling

availability and accuracy of COSMOS maps or domain shift when training data and

Due to their ultrafast nature and vast complexity, monitoring Conical
Intersections experimentally is an open challenge. We present a simulation
study on the ultrafast photorelaxation of uracil, which demonstrates a new
window into Conical Intersections obtained by recording the transient
wavepacket coherence during this passage with an x-ray free electron laser
pulse. We report two major findings. First, we find that the vibronic coherence
at the conical intersection lives for several hundred femtoseconds and can be
measured during this entire time. Second, the time-dependent energy splitting
landscape of the participating vibrational and electronic states is directly
extracted from Wigner spectrograms of the signal. These offer a novel physical
picture of the quantum Conical Intersection pathways through visualizing their
transient vibronic coherence distributions. The path of a nuclear wavepacket
around the Conical Intersection is directly mapped by the proposed experiment.

and effective response. Because infection may be spread by people who are
pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, substantial undetected transmission is likely
to occur before clinical cases are diagnosed. Thus, when outbreaks occur there
is a need to anticipate which populations and locations are at heightened risk
of exposure. In this work, we evaluate the utility of aggregate human mobility
data for estimating the geographic distribution of transmission risk. We
present a simple procedure for producing spatial transmission risk assessments
from near-real-time population mobility data. We validate our estimates against
three well-documented COVID-19 outbreak scenarios in Australia. Two of these
were well-defined transmission clusters and one was a community transmission
scenario. Our results indicate that mobility data can be a good predictor of
geographic patterns of exposure risk from transmission centres, particularly in
scenarios involving workplaces or other environments associated with habitual
travel patterns. For community transmission scenarios, our results demonstrate
that mobility data adds the most value to risk predictions when case counts are
low and spatially clustered. Our method could assist health systems in the
allocation of testing resources, and potentially guide the implementation of
geographically-targeted restrictions on movement and social interaction.

$N$-body system. Our main objective is to investigate the critical particle
number below which, during a gravitational collapse, the amplification of
triaxiality from initial fluctuations is effective, and above which it is
ineffective. To this aim, we develop the Lin-Mestel-Shu theory for a system of
particles initially with isotropic velocity dispersion and with a simple
power-law density profile. We first determine, for an unstable cloud, two radii
corresponding to the balance of two opposing forces and their fluctuations:
such radii fix the sizes of the non-collapsing region and the triaxial seed
from density fluctuations. We hypothesize that the triaxial degree of the final
state depends on which radius is dominant prior to the collapse phase leading
to a different scheme of the self-consistent shape evolution of the core and
the rest of the system. The condition where the two radii are equal therefore
identifies the critical particle number, which can be expressed as the function
of the parameters of initial state. In numerical work, we can pinpoint such a
critical number by comparing the virialized flattening with the initial
flattening. The difference between these two quantities agrees with the
theoretical predictions only for the power-law density profiles with an
exponent in the range $[0,0.25]$. For higher exponents, results suggest that
the critical number is above the range of simulated $N$. We speculate that
there is an additional mechanism, related to strong density gradients that
increases further the flattening, requiring higher $N$ to further weaken the
initial fluctuations.

perturbations (e.g., random noise or intensional adversarial attacks) on state
observations that appear at test time but are unknown during training. To
increase the robustness of DRL policies, previous approaches assume that the
knowledge of adversaries can be added into the training process to achieve the
corresponding generalization ability on these perturbed observations. However,
such an assumption not only makes the robustness improvement more expensive but
may also leave a model less effective to other kinds of attacks in the wild. In
contrast, we propose an adversary agnostic robust DRL paradigm that does not
require learning from adversaries. To this end, we first theoretically derive
that robustness could indeed be achieved independently of the adversaries based
on a policy distillation setting. Motivated by this finding, we propose a new
policy distillation loss with two terms: 1) a prescription gap maximization
loss aiming at simultaneously maximizing the likelihood of the action selected
by the teacher policy and the entropy over the remaining actions; 2) a
corresponding Jacobian regularization loss that minimizes the magnitude of the
gradient with respect to the input state. The theoretical analysis shows that
our distillation loss guarantees to increase the prescription gap and the
adversarial robustness. Furthermore, experiments on five Atari games firmly
verify the superiority of our approach in terms of boosting adversarial
robustness compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

previous work in the context of QCD and it allows to study spin one and spin
zero resonances. The resulting spectrum consists of the states transforming
under the unbroken $SO(4)$ subgroup and those with quantum numbers in the
$SO(5)/SO(4)$ coset. The spin one states are arranged in linear radial

The spin zero states from the coset space correspond to the four massless

contracts is one prominent application of blockchain technology in Business
Process Management (BPM). Existing approaches support a large set of patterns,
modeling languages, and blockchain architectures, which cover a wide range of
practical scenarios. However, they largely neglect the important aspect of
time, a crucial part of process and choreography models manifested in
deadlines, delays, and other temporal constraints. We argue that this deficit
is due to inherent limitations of smart contracts---in particular the absence
of a natural notion of measuring time---on popular blockchain platforms used in
research and practice. We introduce a set of time measures available on
blockchain platforms to alleviate these issues, and systematically compare
their properties. We also give hints as to their suitability for facilitating
various temporal constraints commonly found in process models.

finite-dimensional associative algebras graded by a group G. If G is abelian,
they can be described, using a loop construction, in terms of central simple
graded-division algebras.
  On the other hand, given a finite abelian group G, any central simple
G-graded-division algebra over a field F is determined, thanks to a result of
Picco and Platzeck, by its class in the (ordinary) Brauer group of F and the
isomorphism class of a G-Galois extension of F.
  This connection is used to classify the simple G-Galois extensions of F in
terms of a Galois field extension L/F with Galois group isomorphic to a
quotient G/K and the class of a 2-cocycle of K with values in the
multiplicative group of L modulo a 2-coboundary with values in the
multiplicative group of F, subject to certain conditions. Non-simple G-Galois
extensions are induced from simple T-Galois extensions for a subgroup T of G.
We also classify finite-dimensional G-graded-division algebras and, as an

partial linear models that allows both linear and nonlinear additive
components. In practice, it is challenging to determine which additive
components should be excluded from the model while simultaneously determining
whether nonzero additive components should be represented as linear or
non-linear components in the final model. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian
model selection method that is facilitated by a carefully specified class of
models, including the choice of a prior distribution and the nonparametric
model used for the nonlinear additive components. We employ a series of latent
variables that determine the effect of each variable among the three
possibilities (no effect, linear effect, and nonlinear effect) and that
simultaneously determine the knots of each spline for a suitable penalization
of smooth functions. The use of a pseudo-prior distribution along with a
collapsing scheme enables us to deploy well-behaved Markov chain Monte Carlo
samplers, both for model selection and for fitting the preferred model. Our
method and algorithm are deployed on a suite of numerical studies and are
applied to a nutritional epidemiology study. The numerical results show that
the proposed methodology outperforms previously available methods in terms of
effective sample sizes of the Markov chain samplers and the overall
misclassification rates.

low cost and elasticity. However, like other software, SaaS applications suffer
from code smells, which can drastically affect functionality and resource
usage. Code smell is any design in the source code that indicates a deeper
problem. The software community deploys automated refactoring to eliminate
smells which can improve performance and also decrease the usage of critical
resources. However, studies that analyze the impact of automatic refactoring
smells in SaaS on resources such as CPU and memory have been conducted to a
limited extent. Here, we aim to fill that gap and study the impact on resource
usage of SaaS applications due to automatic refactoring of seven classic code
smells: god class, feature envy, type checking, cyclic dependency, shotgun
surgery, god method, and spaghetti code. We specified six real-life SaaS
applications from Github called Zimbra, OneDataShare, GraphHopper, Hadoop,
JENA, and JAMES which ran on Openstack cloud. Results show that refactoring
smells by tools like JDeodrant and JSparrow have widely varying impacts on the
CPU and memory consumption of the tested applications based on the type of
smell refactored. We present the resource utilization impact of each smell and
also discuss the potential reasons leading to that effect.

data located on local client devices while improving efficiency and privacy.
However, the distribution and quantity of the training data on the clients'
side may lead to significant challenges such as class imbalance and non-IID
(non-independent and identically distributed) data, which could greatly impact
the performance of the common model. While much effort has been devoted to
helping FL models converge when encountering non-IID data, the imbalance issue
has not been sufficiently addressed. In particular, as FL training is executed
by exchanging gradients in an encrypted form, the training data is not
completely observable to either clients or servers, and previous methods for
class imbalance do not perform well for FL. Therefore, it is crucial to design
new methods for detecting class imbalance in FL and mitigating its impact. In
this work, we propose a monitoring scheme that can infer the composition of
training data for each FL round, and design a new loss function --
\textbf{Ratio Loss} to mitigate the impact of the imbalance. Our experiments
demonstrate the importance of acknowledging class imbalance and taking measures
as early as possible in FL training, and the effectiveness of our method in
mitigating the impact. Our method is shown to significantly outperform previous
methods, while maintaining client privacy.

Existing studies have employed strategies based on either loss or uncertainty
to address noisy labels, and ironically some strategies contradict each other:
emphasizing or discarding uncertain samples or concentrating on high or low
loss samples. To elucidate how opposing strategies can enhance model
performance and offer insights into training with noisy labels, we present
analytical results on how loss and uncertainty values of samples change
throughout the training process. From the in-depth analysis, we design a new
robust training method that emphasizes clean and informative samples, while
minimizing the influence of noise using both loss and uncertainty. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets for various deep learning models. The results
show that our method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods

analysis of posts made in reaction to news reports on the Mediterranean
migration crisis and LGBTIQ+ matters in Malta, which was conducted under the
auspices of the EU-funded C.O.N.T.A.C.T. project. Based on the realization that
hate speech is not a clear-cut category to begin with, appears to belong to a
continuum of discriminatory discourse and is often realized through the use of
indirect linguistic means, it is argued that annotation schemes for its
detection should refrain from directly including the label 'hate speech,' as
different annotators might have different thresholds as to what constitutes
hate speech and what not. In view of this, we suggest a multi-layer annotation
scheme, which is pilot-tested against a binary +/- hate speech classification
and appears to yield higher inter-annotator agreement. Motivating the
postulation of our scheme, we then present the MaNeCo corpus on which it will
eventually be used; a substantial corpus of on-line newspaper comments spanning
10 years.

objects, we design a multi-path fine-grained strategy which is able to make
better use of the support feature representations. Second, a new online
refinement strategy is proposed to help the trained model adapt to unseen
classes, achieved by switching the roles of the query and the support images at

in their idiosyncratic plastic behavior, for example kink formation and kink
strengthening. Identifying atomistic details of cluster structures is a
prerequisite for atomistic modeling of LPSO alloys and is crucial for improving
their strength and ductility; however, there is much uncertainty regarding
interstitial atoms in the cluster. Although density functional theory
calculations have shown that the inclusion of Mg interstitial atoms is
energetically most favorable in majority of LPSO alloys, solute elements have
also been experimentally observed at interstitial sites. To predict the
distributions of interstitial atoms in the cluster and to determine the kind of
elements present, it is necessary to identify mechanisms by which interstitial
atoms are created. In the present work, we use density functional theory
calculations to investigate growth processes of solute clusters, specifically
the Mg-Y-Zn LPSO alloy, in order to determine the precise atomistic structure
of its solute clusters. We show that a pair of an interstitial atom and a
vacancy are spontaneously created when a certain number of solute atoms are
absorbed into the cluster, and that all full-grown clusters should include
interstitial atoms. We also demonstrate that interstitial atoms are mostly Mg,
while the rest are Y; interstitial Zn atoms are negligible. This knowledge
greatly simplifies the atomistic modeling of solute clusters in Mg-Y-Zn alloys.
Owing to the vacancies emitted from the cluster, vacancy density should be
super-saturated in regions where solute clusters are growing, and increased
vacancy density accelerates cluster growth.

existing federated learning algorithms for vertically partitioned data are
limited to synchronous computation. To improve the efficiency when the
unbalanced computation/communication resources are common among the parties in
the federated learning system, it is essential to develop asynchronous training
algorithms for vertically partitioned data while keeping the data privacy. In
this paper, we propose an asynchronous federated SGD (AFSGD-VP) algorithm and
its SVRG and SAGA variants on the vertically partitioned data. Moreover, we
provide the convergence analyses of AFSGD-VP and its SVRG and SAGA variants
under the condition of strong convexity. We also discuss their model privacy,
data privacy, computational complexities and communication costs. To the best
of our knowledge, AFSGD-VP and its SVRG and SAGA variants are the first
asynchronous federated learning algorithms for vertically partitioned data.
Extensive experimental results on a variety of vertically partitioned datasets
not only verify the theoretical results of AFSGD-VP and its SVRG and SAGA

the microrheology of active colloids in a polymer matrix and the athermal
dynamics of the in vivo chromosome or cytoskeletal networks. Based on Langevin
dynamics simulation and analytic theory, here we explore such a viscoelastic
active system in depth using a star polymer of functionality $f$ with the
center cross-linker particle being ABP. We observe that the ABP cross-linker,
despite its self-propelled movement, attains an active subdiffusion with the
scaling $\langle\Delta \mathbf{R}^2(t)\rangle\sim t^\alpha$ with $\alpha\leq
1/2$, through the viscoelastic feedback from the polymer. Counter-intuitively,
the apparent anomaly exponent $\alpha$ becomes smaller as the ABP is driven by
a larger propulsion velocity, but is independent of the functionality $f$ or
the boundary conditions of the polymer. We set forth an exact theory, and show
that the motion of the active cross-linker is a gaussian non-Markovian process
characterized by two distinct power-law displacement correlations. At a
moderate P{\'e}clet number, it seemingly behaves as fractional Brownian motion
with a Hurst exponent $H=\alpha/2$, whereas, at a high P{\'e}clet number, the
self-propelled noise in the polymer environment leads to a logarithmic growth

paradigm, Graph Polish, which changes molecular optimization from the

subject to the conditions that the preserved areas around it ought to be
maximized and thereafter the removed and added regions should be minimized. We
then propose an effective and efficient learning framework T&S polish to
capture the long-term dependencies in the optimization steps. The T component
automatically identifies and annotates the optimization centers and the
preservation, removal and addition of some parts of the molecule, and the S
component learns these behaviors and applies these actions to a new molecule.

each molecular optimization result. Experiments with multiple optimization

optimization algorithms. Ideally, benchmark problems closely reflect real-world
problem behavior. Yet, real-world problems are not always readily available for
benchmarking. For example, evaluation costs may be too high, or resources are
unavailable (e.g., software or equipment). As a solution, data from previous
evaluations can be used to train surrogate models which are then used for
benchmarking. The goal is to generate test functions on which the performance
of an algorithm is similar to that on the real-world objective function.
However, predictions from data-driven models tend to be smoother than the
ground-truth from which the training data is derived. This is especially
problematic when the training data becomes sparse. The resulting benchmarks may
not reflect the landscape features of the ground-truth, are too easy, and may
lead to biased conclusions. To resolve this, we use simulation of Gaussian
processes instead of estimation (or prediction). This retains the covariance
properties estimated during model training. While previous research suggested a
decomposition-based approach for a small-scale, discrete problem, we show that
the spectral simulation method enables simulation for continuous optimization
problems. In a set of experiments with an artificial ground-truth, we

the suppressed pairing constant within the interfacial normal layer. For thin

thicker normal layers the Gilbert damping monotonically increases down to the

  Transportation Systems",,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  With the advent of autonomous driving technologies, traffic control at
intersections is expected to experience revolutionary changes. Various novel
intersection control methods have been proposed in the existing literature, and
they can be roughly divided into two categories: vehicle-based traffic control
and phase-based traffic control. Phase-based traffic control can be treated as
updated versions of the current intersection signal control with the
incorporation of the performance of autonomous vehicle functions. Meanwhile,
vehicle-based traffic control utilizes some brand-new methods, mostly in
real-time fashion, to organize traffic at intersections for safe and efficient
vehicle passages. However, to date, no systematic comparison between these two
control categories has been performed to suggest their advantages and
disadvantages. This paper conducts a series of numerical simulations under
various traffic scenarios to perform a fair comparison of their performances.
Specifically, we allow trajectory adjustments of incoming vehicles under
phasebased traffic control, while for its vehicle-based counterpart, we
implement two strategies, i.e., the first-come-first-serve strategy and the
conflict-point based rolling-horizon optimization strategy. Overall, the
simulation results show that vehicle-based traffic control generally incurs a
negligible delay when traffic demand is low but lead to an excessive queuing
time as the traffic volume becomes high. However, performance of vehicle-based
traffic control may benefit from reduction in conflicting vehicle pairs. We
also discovered that when autonomous driving technologies are not mature, the
advantages of phase-based traffic control are much more distinct.

relationship between the slope $K$ of the concentration-dependent sedimentation
velocity and the range $\chi$ of the electrostatic repulsion normalized by the
average particle-particle distance. When $\chi \to 0$, the particles are too
far away from each other to interact electrostatically and $K=6.55$ as
predicted by the theory of Batchelor. As $\chi$ increases, $K$ likewise
increases as if the particle radius increased in proportion to $\chi$ up to a
maximum around $\chi=0.4$. Over the range $\chi=0.4-1$, $K$ relaxes
exponentially to a concentration-dependent constant consistent with known
results for ordered particle distributions. Meanwhile the radial distribution
function transitions from a disordered gas-like to a liquid-like form. Power
law fits to the concentration-dependent sedimentation velocity similarly yield
a simple master curve for the exponent as a function of $\chi$, with a

suggesting the need for highly accurate screw placement. Verifying screw
placement on high-quality tomographic imaging is essential. C-arm Cone-beam CT
(CBCT) provides intraoperative 3D tomographic imaging which would allow for
immediate verification and, if needed, revision. However, the reconstruction
quality attainable with commercial CBCT devices is insufficient, predominantly
due to severe metal artifacts in the presence of pedicle screws. These
artifacts arise from a mismatch between the true physics of image formation and
an idealized model thereof assumed during reconstruction. Prospectively
acquiring views onto anatomy that are least affected by this mismatch can,
therefore, improve reconstruction quality. We propose to adjust the C-arm CBCT
source trajectory during the scan to optimize reconstruction quality with
respect to a certain task, i.e. verification of screw placement. Adjustments
are performed on-the-fly using a convolutional neural network that regresses a
quality index for possible next views given the current x-ray image. Adjusting
the CBCT trajectory to acquire the recommended views results in non-circular
source orbits that avoid poor images, and thus, data inconsistencies. We
demonstrate that convolutional neural networks trained on realistically
simulated data are capable of predicting quality metrics that enable
scene-specific adjustments of the CBCT source trajectory. Using both
realistically simulated data and real CBCT acquisitions of a
semi-anthropomorphic phantom, we show that tomographic reconstructions of the
resulting scene-specific CBCT acquisitions exhibit improved image quality
particularly in terms of metal artifacts. Since the optimization objective is
implicitly encoded in a neural network, the proposed approach overcomes the
need for 3D information at run-time.

the presence of thin flux tubes of 200-400~km in diameter and of field strength
of 1000-2000~G. The HMI power spectra determined for a coronal hole, a quiet
sun and a plage areas exhibit the same spectral index of -1 on a broad range of
spatial scales from 10-20~Mm down to 2.4~Mm. This implies that the same
mechanism(s) of magnetic field generation operate everywhere in the undisturbed
photosphere. The most plausible one is the local turbulent dynamo. When
compared to the HMI spectra, the -1.2 slope of the NIRIS spectrum appears to be
more extended into the short spatial range until the cutoff at 0.8-0.9~Mm,
after which it continues with a steeper slope of -2.2. Comparison of the
observed and Kolmogorov-type spectra allowed us to infer that the Kolmogorov
turbulent cascade cannot account for more than 35\% of the total magnetic
energy observed in the scale range of 3.5-0.3~Mm. The energy excess can be
attributed to other mechanisms of field generation such as the local turbulent
dynamo and magnetic super-diffusivity observed in an undisturbed photosphere
that can slow down the rate of the Kolmogorov cascade leading to a shallower
resulting spectrum.

atomic clocks at Beijing 203 Institute Laboratory (BIL) for 20 days as
zero-baseline calibration, we transport one clock to Luojiashan Time-Frequency
Station (LTS), Wuhan, without stopping its running. Continuous comparisons
between the two remote clocks were conducted for 65 days based on the Common
View Satellite Time Transfer (CVSTT) technique. The ensemble empirical mode
decomposition (EEMD) technique is applied to removing the uninteresting
periodic signals contaminated in the original CVSTT observations to obtain the
residual clocks-offsets series, from which the time elapse between the two
remote clocks was determined. Based on the accumulated time elapse between
these two clocks the geopotential difference between these two stations was
determined. Given the orthometric height (OH) of BIL, the OH of the LTS was
determined based on the determined geopotential difference. Comparisons show
that the OH of the LTS determined by time elapse comparisons deviates from that
determined by Earth gravity model EGM2008 by about 98 m. The results are
consistent with the frequency stabilities of the hydrogen atomic clocks (at the
level of $10^{-15}$/day) applied in our experiments. In addition, we used
85-days original observations to determine the geopotential difference between
two remote stations based on the CVSTT technique. Using more precise atomic or
optical clocks, the CVSTT method for geopotential determination could be
applied effectively and extensively in geodesy in the future.

But few connections have been found for the HOTIs with the well explored

recently, a proposal asserts that a significant bridge can be established
between the HOTIs and the Z_2 topological insulators. When subject to an
in-plane Zeeman field, the corner states, the signature of the HOTIs, can be
induced in a Z_2 topological insulator. Such Zeeman field can be produced, for
example, by the ferromagnetic proximity effect or magnetic atom doping, which
obviously involves the drastically experimental complexity. Here we show that,
a phononic crystal, designed as a bilayer of coupled acoustic cavities, hosts
exactly the Kane-Mele model with built-in in-plane Zeeman fields. We observe
that the helical edge states along the zigzag edges are gapped, and the corner
states, localized spatially at the corners of the samples, appear in the gap,
confirming the effect induced by the Zeeman field. We further demonstrate the
intriguing contrast properties of the corner states at the outer and inner
corners in a hexagonal ring-shaped sample.

  The shape of the transverse mass spectra differs from the shapes measured in
central Pb+Pb collisions and inelastic p+p interactions. The normalized width
of the rapidity distribution decreases with increasing collision energy and is
in between the results for inelastic nucleon-nucleon and central Pb+Pb
collisions. The mean multiplicity of pions per wounded nucleon in

grid-connected distributed energy systems (DES) often exclude the inherent
nonlinearities related to power flow and generation and storage units, to
maintain an accuracy-complexity balance. Such models may provide sub-optimal or
even infeasible designs and dispatch schedules. In DES, optimal power flow
(OPF) is often misrepresented and treated as a standalone problem. OPF consists
of highly nonlinear and nonconvex constraints related to the underlying
alternating current (AC) distribution network. This aspect of the optimisation
problem has often been overlooked by researchers in the process systems and
optimisation area. In this review we address the disparity between OPF and DES
models, highlighting the importance of including elements of OPF in DES design
and operational models to ensure that the design and operation of microgrids
meet the requirements of the electrical grid. By analysing foundational models
for both DES and OPF, we identify detailed technical power flow constraints
that have been typically represented using oversimplified linear approximations
in DES models. We also identify a subset of models, labelled DES-OPF, which
include these detailed constraints and use innovative optimisation approaches
to solve them. Results of these studies suggest that achieving feasible
solutions with high-fidelity models is more important than achieving globally
optimal solutions using less-detailed DES models. Recommendations for future
work include the need for more comparisons between high-fidelity models and
models with linear approximations, and the use of simulation tools to validate
DES-OPF models. The review is aimed at a multidisciplinary audience of
researchers and stakeholders who are interested in modelling DES to support the
development of more robust and accurate optimisation models for the future.

potential to significantly speed up image reconstruction with reduced
measurements recently. Rather than the existing generative models that often
optimize the density priors, in this work, by taking advantage of the denoising
score matching, homotopic gradients of generative density priors (HGGDP) are
proposed for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. More precisely,
to tackle the low-dimensional manifold and low data density region issues in
generative density prior, we estimate the target gradients in
higher-dimensional space. We train a more powerful noise conditional score
network by forming high-dimensional tensor as the network input at the training
phase. More artificial noise is also injected in the embedding space. At the
reconstruction stage, a homotopy method is employed to pursue the density
prior, such as to boost the reconstruction performance. Experiment results
imply the remarkable performance of HGGDP in terms of high reconstruction
accuracy; only 10% of the k-space data can still generate images of high

and wall-wall boundaries. Most recent methods solve this problem based on
edge/keypoint detection or semantic segmentation. However, these approaches
have shown limited attention on the geometry of the dominant planes and the
intersection between them, which has significant impact on room layout. In this
work, we propose to incorporate geometric reasoning to deep learning for layout
estimation. Our approach learns to infer the depth maps of the dominant planes
in the scene by predicting the pixel-level surface parameters, and the layout
can be generated by the intersection of the depth maps. Moreover, we present a
new dataset with pixel-level depth annotation of dominant planes. It is larger
than the existing datasets and contains both cuboid and non-cuboid rooms.
Experimental results show that our approach produces considerable performance

short-period variables. The light curves are characterised by non-coherent
periods dominated by the fundamental and first harmonic with variable relative
amplitudes. By comparing the equatorial rotational velocities obtained from the
photometric fundamental periods with the projected rotational velocities,it is
shown that the fundamental period is indistinguishable from the rotation
period. The distributions of the projected rotational velocities and the
equatorial rotational velocities for Be and non-Be stars are discussed. Using
the equatorial rotational velocities of Be stars directly determined from the
photometric period, it is found that, on average, Be stars rotate at about 0.66
of critical velocity. This result is independent of assumptions concerning
gravity darkening. It is shown that the rotational amplitudes of Be stars
increase with effective temperature and are considerably higher than those of
non-Be stars. The amplitude distributions of Be and non-Be stars are also
significantly different. Of particular interest is a large rise in rotational
amplitudes from A0 to B5 for non-Be stars. We suspect that this may be a result
of the increasing importance of a line-driven wind. Perhaps the Be stars are
just those with greatest surface activity with increased mass loss aided by
rapid rotation.

modelled by contact mechanics relations and a Coulomb friction law, with
particular attention on coupling of fracture dilation to the governing
equations in both fractures and matrix.
  The model is discretised using multi-point finite volumes for the balance
equations and a semismooth Newton scheme for the contact conditions and is
implemented in the open source fracture simulation toolbox PorePy. Finally,
simulation studies demonstrate the model's convergence, investigate

variables and random branching gives rise to probabilistic programs. The
termination problem is one of the most fundamental liveness properties for such
programs. The qualitative (aka almost-sure) termination problem asks whether a
given program terminates with probability 1. Ranking functions provide a sound
and complete approach for termination of non-probabilistic programs, and their
extension to probabilistic programs is achieved via ranking supermartingales
(RSMs). RSMs have been extended to lexicographic RSMs to handle programs with
involved control-flow structure, as well as for compositional approach. There
are two key limitations of the existing RSM-based approaches: First, the
lexicographic RSM-based approach requires a strong nonnegativity assumption,
which need not always be satisfied. The second key limitation of the existing
RSM-based algorithmic approaches is that they rely on pre-computed invariants.
The main drawback of relying on pre-computed invariants is the
insufficiency-inefficiency trade-off: weak invariants might be insufficient for
RSMs to prove termination, while using strong invariants leads to inefficiency
in computing them. Our contributions are twofold: First, we show how to relax
the strong nonnegativity condition and still provide soundness guarantee for
almost-sure termination. Second, we present an incremental approach where the
process of computing lexicographic RSMs proceeds by iterative pruning of parts
of the program that were already shown to be terminating, in cooperation with a
safety prover. In particular, our technique does not rely on strong
pre-computed invariants. We present experimental results to show the
applicability of our approach to examples of probabilistic programs from the

physical proximity between people over time with a central and trusted
authority, so that when one user reports infection, it is possible to identify
all other users who have been in close proximity to that person during a
relevant time period in the past and alert them. One way to achieve this
involves recording on the server the locations, e.g. by reading and reporting

features raise individual costs for inclusion in a model. These costs allow to
incorporate disfavored aspects of features, e.g. failure rates of as measuring
device, or patient harm, in the model selection process. Random Forests define
a particularly challenging problem for feature selection, as features are
generally entangled in an ensemble of multiple trees, which makes a post hoc
removal of features infeasible. Feature selection methods therefore often
either focus on simple pre-filtering methods, or require many Random Forest
evaluations along their optimization path, which drastically increases the
computational complexity. To solve both issues, we propose Shallow Tree
Selection, a novel fast and multivariate feature selection method that selects
features from small tree structures. Additionally, we also adapt three standard
feature selection algorithms for cost-sensitive learning by introducing a
hyperparameter-controlled benefit-cost ratio criterion (BCR) for each method.
In an extensive simulation study, we assess this criterion, and compare the
proposed methods to multiple performance-based baseline alternatives on four
artificial data settings and seven real-world data settings. We show that all
methods using a hyperparameterized BCR criterion outperform the baseline
alternatives. In a direct comparison between the proposed methods, each method
indicates strengths in certain settings, but no one-fits-all solution exists.
On a global average, we could identify preferable choices among our BCR based
methods. Nevertheless, we conclude that a practical analysis should never rely
on a single method only, but always compare different approaches to obtain the
best results.

base station selection problems, where different networks have different
traffic loads. In a fast-varying vehicular environment, computation offloading
experience of users is strongly affected by the latency due to the congestion
at the edge computing servers co-located with the base stations. However, as a
result of the non-stationary property of such an environment and also
information shortage, predicting this congestion is an involved task. To
address this challenge, we propose an on-line learning algorithm and an
off-policy learning algorithm based on multi-armed bandit theory. To
dynamically select the least congested network in a piece-wise stationary
environment, these algorithms predict the latency that the offloaded tasks
experience using the offloading history. In addition, to minimize the task loss
due to the mobility of the vehicles, we develop a method for base station
selection. Moreover, we propose a relaying mechanism for the selected network,

been classified according to variability type. A large proportion of stars of
all spectral types appear to have periods consistent with the expected rotation
periods. A previous analysis of A and late B stars strongly suggests that these
stars are indeed rotational variables. In this paper we have accumulated
sufficient data to show that rotational modulation is present even among the
early B stars. A search for flares in TESS A and B stars resulted in the
detection of 110 flares in 68 stars. The flare energies exceed those of typical
K and M dwarfs by at least two orders of magnitude. These results, together
with severe difficulties of current models to explain stellar pulsations in A

outer layers of stars with radiative envelopes.

non-trivial query algorithms exist are symmetric in nature. The most well known
techniques in this domain exploit parity decision trees, in which the parity of
two bits can be obtained by a single query. Thus, exact quantum query
algorithms outperforming parity decision trees are rare. In this paper we first
obtain optimal exact quantum query algorithms ($Q_{algo}(f)$) for a direct sum
based class of $\Omega \left( 2^{\frac{\sqrt{n}}{2}} \right)$ non-symmetric
functions. We construct these algorithms by analyzing the algebraic normal form
together with a novel untangling strategy. Next we obtain the generalized
parity decision tree complexity ($D_{\oplus}(f)$) analysing the Walsh Spectrum.
Finally, we show that query complexity of $Q_{algo}$ is $\lceil \frac{3n}{4}

measures in many cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first family
of algorithms beyond generalized parity (and thus parity) for a large class of

functions, but could only obtain partial results using similar algorithmic

architectures using 3D convolution or multibranch networks to extract
spatial-temporal video features. By contrast, in this paper, we illustrate
superior performance from a simple single stream 2D convolution network

dark-mode effect induced by two mechanical modes coupled to a common cavity
field. This is realized by introducing a phase-dependent phonon-exchange
interaction, which is used to form a loop-coupled configuration. Combining this
phase-dependent coupling with the optomechanical interactions, the dark-mode
effect can be controlled by the quantum interference effect. In particular, the
dark-mode effect in this two-mechanical-mode optomechanical system can lead to
a double-amplified optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) window and a
higher efficiency of the second-order sideband in comparison with the standard
optomechanical system. This is because the effective mechanical decay rate
related to the linewidth of the OMIT window becomes a twofold increase in the
weak-coupling limit. When the dark-mode effect is broken, controllable double
transparency windows appear and the second-order sideband, as well as the light
delay or advance, is significantly enhanced. For an N-mechanical-mode
optomechanical system, we find that in the presence of the dark-mode effect,
the amplification multiple of the linewidth of the OMIT window is nearly
proportional to the number of mechanical modes, and that the OMIT with a single
window becomes the one with N tunable windows by breaking the dark-mode effect.
The study will be useful in optical information storage within a
large-frequency bandwidth and multichannel optical communication based on
optomechanical systems.

These light cluster yields may be used to probe dense matter, and to infer
in-medium corrections. Continuum correlations are calculated from scattering
phase shifts using the Beth-Uhlenbeck formula, and the effect of medium
modification is estimated. The relevant distribution is reconstructed from the
measured yields of isotopes. This describes the state of the nucleon system at
scission and cluster formation, using only three Lagrange parameters which are
the nonequilibrium counterparts of the temperature and chemical potentials, as
defined in thermodynamic equilibrium. We concluded that a simple nuclear
statistical equilibrium model neglecting continuum correlations and medium

different user needs. However, the requirements for these services are
competing in nature, which impresses the necessity of a coordinated and
flexible network architecture. Although coordinated multipoint (CoMP) systems
were primarily proposed to improve the cell edge performance in 4G, their
collaborative nature can be leveraged to support the diverse requirements and
enabling technologies of 5G and beyond networks. To this end, we propose
generalization of CoMP to a proactive and efficient resource utilization
framework capable of supporting different user requirements such as
reliability, latency, throughput, and security while considering network
constraints. This article elaborates on the multiple aspects, inputs, and
outputs of the generalized CoMP (GCoMP) framework. Apart from user
requirements, the GCoMP decision mechanism also considers the CoMP scenario and
network architecture to decide upon outputs such as CoMP technique or
appropriate coordinating clusters. To enable easier understanding of the
concept, popular use cases, such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication
and eHealth, are studied. Additionally, interesting challenges and open areas
in GCoMP are discussed.

to the ""particulars"" of the pandemic at hand. For new viruses such as Covid-19,
the epidemiology driving the modelling process may not be well known and model
estimation with limited data may be unreliable. With this motivation in mind,
the new paradigm described here is data-driven and, to a large extent, we avoid
modelling difficulties by concentrating on just two key quantities which are
common to pandemics: the doubling time, denoted by $d(k)$ and the peak day
denoted by $\theta(k)$. Our numerical studies to date suggest that our
appealingly simple model can provide a reasonable fit to real data. Given that
time is of the essence during the ongoing global health crisis, the intent of
this paper is to introduce this new paradigm to control practitioners and
describe a number of new research directions suggested by our current results.

propose a combination of the Lagrange multiplier method with variational
transfer to allow for complex non-conforming geometries as well as hybrid- and
equi-dimensional models and discretizations of flow through fractured porous
media. The variational transfer is based on the $L^2$-projection and enables an
accurate and highly efficient parallel projection of fields between
non-conforming meshes (e.g.,\ between fracture and porous matrix domain). We
present the different techniques as a unified mathematical framework with a
practical perspective. By means of numerical examples we discuss both,
performance and applicability of the particular strategies. Comparisons of
finite element simulation results to widely adopted 2D benchmark cases show
good agreement and the dual Lagrange multiplier spaces show good performance.
In an extension to 3D fracture networks, we first provide complementary results
to a recently developed benchmark case, before we explore a complex scenario

develop two novel prior models for identification of active mediators in

  to inconsistencies in stride time series: A modeling study","Article submitted for publication",,,,"q-bio.QM","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Background: Human gait exhibits complex fractal fluctuations among
consecutive strides. The time series of gait parameters are long-range
correlated (statistical persistence). In contrast, when gait is synchronized
with external rhythmic cues, the fluctuation regime is modified to stochastic
oscillations around the target frequency (statistical anti-persistence). To
highlight these two fluctuation modes, the prevalent methodology is the
detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA). The DFA outcome is the scaling exponent,
which lies between 0.5 and 1 if the time series exhibit long-range
correlations, and below 0.5 if the time series is anti-correlated. A
fundamental assumption for applying DFA is that the analyzed time series
results from a time-invariant generating process. However, a gait time series
may be constituted by an ensemble of sub-segments with distinct fluctuation
regimes (e.g., correlated and anti-correlated). Methods: Several proportions of
correlated and anti-correlated time series were mixed together and then
analyzed through DFA. The original (before mixing) time series were generated
via autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average (ARFIMA) modelling or
actual gait data. Results: Results evidenced a nonlinear sensitivity of DFA to
the mix of correlated and anti-correlated series. Notably, adding a small
proportion of correlated segments into an anti-correlated time series had
stronger effects than the reverse. Significance: In case of changes in gait
control during a walking trial, the resulting time series may be a patchy
ensemble of several fluctuation regimes. When applying DFA, the scaling
exponent may be misinterpreted. Cued walking studies may be most at risk of
suffering this issue in cases of sporadic synchronization with external cues.

reliability and risk assessment. We consider failure events that are expressed
in terms of a limit-state function, which depends on the solution of a partial
differential equation (PDE). In many applications, the PDE cannot be solved
analytically. We can only evaluate an approximation of the exact PDE solution.
Therefore, the probability of rare events is estimated with respect to an
approximation of the limit-state function. This leads to an approximation error
in the estimate of the probability of rare events. Indeed, we prove an error
bound for the approximation error of the probability of failure, which behaves
like the discretization accuracy of the PDE multiplied by an approximation of
the probability of failure, the first order reliability method (FORM) estimate.
This bound requires convexity of the failure domain. For non-convex failure
domains, we prove an error bound for the relative error of the FORM estimate.
Hence, we derive a relationship between the required accuracy of the
probability of rare events estimate and the PDE discretization level. This
relationship can be used to guide practicable reliability analyses and, for
instance, multilevel methods.

two-step pumping scheme for dissipative Kerr soliton (DKS) generation.
Controllable interaction between stimulated Brillouin lasing and Kerr
nonlinearity enhances the DKS coherence and mitigate the thermal instability

formalism yield a tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \sim 10^{-3}$ which lies well
within the expected accuracy of near-future experiments $ \sim 10^{-4}$. When
the Palatini formalism is employed, the predicted values of $r$ get
highly-suppressed $r\sim 10^{-12}$ and consequently a possible non-detection of
primordial tensor fluctuations will rule out only the metric variant of the
model. On the other hand, the extremely small values predicted for $r$ by the
Palatini approach constitute contact with observations a hopeless task for the
foreseeable future. In this work, we propose a way to remedy this issue by
extending the action with the inclusion of a generalized non-minimal derivative
coupling term between the inflaton and the Einstein tensor of the form
$m^{-2}(\phi) G_{\mu\nu}\nabla^{\mu}\phi \nabla^{\nu}\phi$. We find that with
such a modification, the Palatini predictions can become comparable with the
ones obtained in the metric formalism, thus providing ample room for the model
to be in contact with observations in the near future.

define data augmentation between point clouds as a shortest path linear
interpolation. To that end, we introduce PointMixup, an interpolation method
that generates new examples through an optimal assignment of the path function
between two point clouds. We prove that our PointMixup finds the shortest path
between two point clouds and that the interpolation is assignment invariant and
linear. With the definition of interpolation, PointMixup allows to introduce
strong interpolation-based regularizers such as mixup and manifold mixup to the
point cloud domain. Experimentally, we show the potential of PointMixup for
point cloud classification, especially when examples are scarce, as well as
increased robustness to noise and geometric transformations to points. The code

preserving translation symmetry of underlying lattice has aroused great
interest as a new quantum state, but only a few candidate materials have been
reported. Recently, in a spin-orbit coupled Mott insulator \SIR, the emergence
of a possible hidden order phase with broken inversion symmetry has been
suggested at $T_{\Omega}$ above the N\'{e}el temperature by optical second
harmonic generation measurements. Moreover, polarized neutron diffraction
measurements revealed the broken time reversal symmetry below $T_{\Omega}$,
which was supported by subsequent muon spin relaxation experiments. However,
the nature of this mysterious phase remains largely elusive. Here, we
investigate the hidden order phase through the combined measurements of the
in-plane magnetic anisotropy with exceptionally high-precision magnetic torque
and the nematic susceptibility with elastoresistance. A distinct two-fold
in-plane magnetic anisotropy along the [110] Ir-O-Ir bond direction sets in
below $\sim T_{\Omega}$, providing thermodynamic evidence for a nematic phase
transition with broken $C_4$ rotational symmetry. However, in contrast to the
even-parity nematic transition reported in other correlated electron systems,
the nematic susceptibility exhibits no divergent behavior towards $T_{\Omega}$.
These results provide bulk evidence for an odd-parity order parameter with
broken rotational symmetry in the hidden order state. We discuss the hidden
order in terms of an anapole state, in which polar toroidal moment is induced
by two current loops in each IrO$_6$ octahedron of opposite chirality. Contrary
to the simplest loop-current pattern previously suggested, the present results
are consistent with a pattern in which the intra-unit cell loop-current flows
along only one of the diagonal directions in the IrO$_4$ square.

to a linear-in-temperature resistivity $\rho_{xx}\propto T$, which is close to
the Planckian limit, the Hall angle varies as $\cot \theta_{\rm H} \propto T^2$

properties shows striking resemblance with those reported in cuprate,

desirable feature because it allows to generate new data in a supervised

low-dimensional mapping of the input stream, by deriving a generalized
algorithm starting from Self Organizing Maps (SOMs). SOMs are a kind of neural
network which can be trained with unsupervised learning to produce a
low-dimensional discretized mapping of the input space. They can be used for
the generation of new data through backward propagation of interpolations made
from the mapping grid. Unfortunately the final topology of the mapping space of
a SOM is not known before learning, so interpolating new data in a supervised
way is not an easy task. Here we will show a variation from the SOM algorithm
consisting in constraining the update of prototypes so that it is also a
function of the distance of its prototypes from extrinsically given targets in
the mapping space. We will demonstrate how such variants, that we will call
Supervised Topological Maps (STMs), allow for a supervised mapping where the
position of internal representations in the mapping space is determined by the
experimenter. Controlling the internal representation space in STMs reveals to
be an easier task than what is currently done using other algorithms such as
variational or adversarial autoencoders.

quite a few students have not developed a robust conceptual understanding of
basic engineering knowledge of the heat engine, including the function of the
regenerator and the influence of piston movements on the heat and work involved
in the engine. Most notably, although the science error ratios of the three

classes were high (above 50\%), and the class that was given a simple tutorial
of engineering knowledge of heat engine exhibited significantly smaller

both the written answers and post-test interviews show that most of the

other reversible cycles working between two heat reservoirs, probably because
no enough cycles except Carnot cycle were covered in the traditional

degree of electroluminescence circular polarization (Pc) ~19% is measured in

perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB/MgO spin injector allowing efficient spin
injection and an appropriate p-doped InGaAs/GaAs QD layer in the active region.
By analyzing the bias and temperature dependence of the electroluminescence
circular polarization, we have evidenced a two-step spin relaxation process.
The first step occurs when electrons tunnel through the MgO barrier and travel
across the GaAs depletion layer. The spin relaxation is dominated by the
Dyakonov-Perel mechanism related to the kinetic energy of electrons, which is
characterized by a bias dependent Pc. The second step occurs when electrons are
captured into QDs prior to their radiative recombination with holes. The
temperature dependence of Pc reflects the temperature induced modification of
the QDs doping, together with the variation of the ratio between the charge
carrier lifetime and the spin relaxation time inside the QDs. The understanding
of these spin relaxation mechanisms is essential to improve the performance of
spin LED for future spin optoelectronic applications at room temperature under

engagement (several tens of comments) or a spontaneous fervent user engagement
(thousands of comments). In this paper, we study the problem of predicting the
total number of user comments a news article will receive. Our main insight is
that the early dynamics of user comments contribute the most to an accurate
prediction, while news article specific factors have surprisingly little
influence. This appears to be an interesting and understudied phenomenon:
collective social behavior at a news outlet shapes user response and may even
downplay the content of an article. We compile and analyze a large number of
features, both old and novel from literature. The features span a broad
spectrum of facets including news article and comment contents, temporal
dynamics, sentiment/linguistic features, and user behaviors. We show that the
early arrival rate of comments is the best indicator of the eventual number of
comments. We conduct an in-depth analysis of this feature across several
dimensions, such as news outlets and news article categories. We show that the
relationship between the early rate and the final number of comments as well as
the prediction accuracy vary considerably across news outlets and news article

physics, but also has come with various challenges and systematic errors in
analysis. In this work, we revisit the optimal quadratic estimator for
$P_{\mathrm{1D}}$, which is robust against the relevant problems such as pixel

improve the estimator by introducing a fiducial power spectrum, which enables
us to extract more information by alleviating the discreteness of band powers.
We meticulously apply our method to synthetic DESI spectra and demonstrate how
the estimator overcomes each challenge. We further apply an optimisation scheme
that approximates the Fisher matrix to three elements per row and reduces

fundamental interest to planetary science, providing clues to the formation and
evolutionary history of the target bodies and the solar system as a whole.
X-ray fluorescence (XRF) lines, triggered either by solar X-rays or energetic
ions, are intrinsic to atomic energy levels and carry an unambiguous signature
of the elemental composition of the emitting bodies. All remote-sensing XRF
spectrometers used so far on planetary orbiters have been collimated
instruments, with limited achievable spatial resolution, and many have used
archaic X-ray detectors with poor energy resolution. Focusing X-ray optics
provide true spectroscopic imaging and are used widely in astrophysics
missions, but until now their mass and volume have been too large for
resource-limited in-situ planetary missions. Recent advances in X-ray
instrumentation such as the Micro-Pore Optics used on the BepiColombo X-ray
instrument (Fraser et al., 2010), Miniature X-ray Optics (Hong et al., 2016)
and highly radiation tolerant CMOS X-ray sensors (e.g., Kenter et al., 2012)
enable compact, yet powerful, truly focusing X-ray Imaging Spectrometers. Such
instruments will enable compositional measurements of planetary bodies with
much better spatial resolution and thus open a large new discovery space in

Nuclear Astrophysics, Geophysics, and Biology are carried out. The
investigation of the neutrinoless double beta decay has been one of the main
research lines of LSC since the beginning. Many unknowns remain in the
characterization of the basic neutrino properties and the study of this rare
decay process requiring Physics beyond the Standard Model of Particle Physics
can shed light on the lepton number conservation, the nature of the neutrinos
as Dirac or Majorana particles and the absolute scale and ordering of the
masses of the three generations. Here, the double beta decay searches performed
at LSC for different emitters and following very different experimental
approaches will be reviewed: from the very first experiments in the laboratory
including the successful IGEX for $^{76}$Ge, which released very stringent

implementing innovative detector technologies to discriminate backgrounds. For
the neutrinoless double beta decay channel and at 90% C.L., IGEX derived a
limit to the half-life of $^{76}$Ge of $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 1.57 \times 10^{25}$ y
while the corresponding expected limits are $T_{1/2}^{0\nu} > 1.0\times

observations show that a very fast and strong magnetic cloud (MC) is behind the
ICME shock and the proton intensity-time profiles observed at 1 au had a rapid
two-step decrease near the sheath and MC. Therefore, we study the effect of
sheath and MC on SEPs accelerated by an ICME shock through numerically solving
the focused transport equation. The shock is regarded as a moving source of
SEPs with an assumed particle distribution function. The sheath and MC are set
to thick spherical caps with enhanced magnetic field, and the turbulence levels
in sheath and MC are set to be higher and lower than that of the ambient solar
wind, respectively. The simulation results of proton intensity-time profiles
agree well with the observations in energies ranging from $\sim$1 to $\sim$100
MeV, and the two-step decrease is reproduced when the sheath and MC arrived at
the Earth. The simulation results show that the sheath-MC structure reduced the
proton intensities for about 2 days after shock passing through the Earth. It
is found that the sheath contributed most of the decrease while the MC
facilitated the formation of the second step decrease. The simulation also
infers that the coordination of magnetic field and turbulence in sheath-MC
structure can produce a stronger effect of reducing SEP intensities.

  minimization",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Identifying optimal values for a high-dimensional set of hyperparameters is a
problem that has received growing attention given its importance to large-scale
machine learning applications such as neural architecture search. Recently
developed optimization methods can be used to select thousands or even millions
of hyperparameters. Such methods often yield overfit models, however, leading
to poor performance on unseen data. We argue that this overfitting results from
using the standard hyperparameter optimization objective function. Here we
present an alternative objective that is equivalent to a Probably Approximately
Correct-Bayes (PAC-Bayes) bound on the expected out-of-sample error. We then
devise an efficient gradient-based algorithm to minimize this objective; the
proposed method has asymptotic space and time complexity equal to or better
than other gradient-based hyperparameter optimization methods. We show that
this new method significantly reduces out-of-sample error when applied to
hyperparameter optimization problems known to be prone to overfitting.

  Reconfiguration","9 pages, UrbComp 2020",,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Bike sharing has become one of the major choices of transportation for
residents in metropolitan cities worldwide. A station-based bike sharing system
is usually operated in the way that a user picks up a bike from one station,
and drops it off at another. Bike stations are, however, not static, as the
bike stations are often reconfigured to accommodate changing demands or city
urbanization over time. One of the key operations is to evaluate candidate
locations and install new stations to expand the bike sharing station network.
Conventional practices have been studied to predict existing station usage,
while evaluating new stations is highly challenging due to the lack of the
historical bike usage.
  To fill this gap, in this work we propose a novel and efficient bike
station-level prediction algorithm called AtCoR, which can predict the bike
usage at both existing and new stations (candidate locations during
reconfiguration). In order to address the lack of historical data issues,
virtual historical usage of new stations is generated according to their
correlations with the surrounding existing stations, for AtCoR model
initialization. We have designed novel station-centered heatmaps which
characterize for each target station centered at the heatmap the trend that
riders travel between it and the station's neighboring regions, enabling the
model to capture the learnable features of the bike station network. The
captured features are further applied to the prediction of bike usage for new
stations. Our extensive experiment study on more than 23 million trips from
three major bike sharing systems in US, including New York City, Chicago and
Los Angeles, shows that AtCoR outperforms baselines and state-of-art models in
prediction of both existing and future stations.

chi-squared divergence based PAC-Bayesian bounds in terms of nature of their

KL-divergence, linear and squared distances. Optimal posterior weights are
proportional to deviations of empirical risks, usually with subset support. For
uniform prior, it is sufficient to search among posteriors on classifier
subsets ordered by these risks. We show the bound minimization for linear
distance as a convex program and obtain a closed-form expression for its
optimal posterior. Whereas that for squared distance is a quasi-convex program
under a specific condition, and the one for KL-divergence is non-convex
optimization (a difference of convex functions). To compute such optimal
posteriors, we derive fast converging fixed point (FP) equations. We apply
these approaches to a finite set of SVM regularization parameter values to
yield stochastic SVMs with tight bounds. We perform a comprehensive performance
comparison between our optimal posteriors and known KL-divergence based
posteriors on a variety of UCI datasets with varying ranges and variances in
risk values, etc. Chi-squared divergence based posteriors have weaker bounds

there are a number of prediction tasks commonly performed including
classification and regression. In binarised regression, binary decisions are
generated from a learned regression model (or real-valued dependent variable),
which is useful when the division between instances that should be predicted
positive or negative depends on the utility. For example, in mining, the
boundary between a valuable rock and a waste rock depends on the market price
of various metals, which varies with time. This paper proposes impact curves to
evaluate binarised regression with instance-varying costs, where some instances
are much worse to be classified as positive (or negative) than other instances;
e.g., it is much worse to throw away a high-grade gold rock than a medium-grade
copper-ore rock, even if the mine wishes to keep both because both are
profitable. We show how to construct an impact curve for a variety of domains,
including examples from healthcare, mining, and entertainment. Impact curves
optimize binary decisions across all utilities of the chosen utility function,
identify the conditions where one model may be favoured over another, and

predictive models by empirically establishing the adequate sample size, which
balances the competing objectives of improving model performance and reducing
model complexity as well as computational requirements.
  Materials and Methods: We empirically assess the effect of sample size on
prediction performance and model complexity by generating learning curves for
81 prediction problems in three large observational health databases, requiring
training of 17,248 prediction models. The adequate sample size was defined as
the sample size for which the performance of a model equalled the maximum model
performance minus a small threshold value.
  Results: The adequate sample size achieves a median reduction of the number
of observations between 9.5% and 78.5% for threshold values between 0.001 and
0.02. The median reduction of the number of predictors in the models at the
adequate sample size varied between 8.6% and 68.3%, respectively.
  Discussion: Based on our results a conservative, yet significant, reduction
in sample size and model complexity can be estimated for future prediction
work. Though, if a researcher is willing to generate a learning curve a much
larger reduction of the model complexity may be possible as suggested by a
large outcome-dependent variability.
  Conclusion: Our results suggest that in most cases only a fraction of the
available data was sufficient to produce a model close to the performance of
one developed on the full data set, but with a substantially reduced model
complexity.

the super-Eddington phase is dominated by radiation pressure (model B) with
Thomson opacity. We derive the viscosity prescribed by the stress tensor,
$\Pi_{r\phi}\propto \Sigma_d^b r^d$ where $\Sigma_d$ is the surface density of
the disk, $r$ is the radius and $b$ and $d$ are constants. The specific choice
of radiative or $\alpha$ viscosity is motivated, and its parameters are decided
by the expected disk luminosity and evolution time scale being in the observed
range. The disk evolves due to mass loss by accretion onto the black hole and
outflowing wind, and mass gain by fallback of the debris; this results in an
increasing outer radius. We have simulated the luminosity profile for both sub

few months. In particular the pace at which pandemic has spread has taken
everybody off-guard. The Governments across the world have responded by
imposing lock-downs, stopping/restricting travel and mandating social
distancing. On the positive side there is wide availability of information on
active cases, recoveries and deaths collected daily across regions. However,
what has been particularly challenging is to track the spread of the disease by
asymptomatic carriers termed as super-spreaders. In this paper we look at
applying Hidden Markov Model to get a better assessment of extent of spread.
The outcome of such analysis can be useful to Governments to design the
required interventions/responses in a calibrated manner. The data we have
chosen to analyze pertains to Indian scenario.

complex transformations (self-organization) in a constant battle for survival,
but inevitably ageing and disease trap them to death. Can ageing be understood
and eventually reversed? What tools can be employed to further our
understanding of ageing? The present article is an invitation for biologists
and clinicians to consider key conceptual ideas and computational tools (known
to mathematicians and physicists), which potentially may help dissect some of
the underlying processes of ageing and disease. Specifically, we first discuss
how to classify and analyze complex systems, as well as highlight critical
theoretical difficulties that make complex systems hard to study. Subsequently,
we introduce Topological Data Analysis - a novel Big Data tool - which may help
in the study of complex systems since it extracts knowledge from data in a
holistic approach via topological considerations. These conceptual ideas and
tools are discussed in a rather informal way to pave future discussions and

on strong field regime and nuclear matter in extreme conditions. Motivated by
the recent discovery of a compact object with $2.59^{+0.08}_{-0.09} M_\odot$ in
the binary merger GW190814, if this object was a NS, it serves as a strong
constraint on the NS equation of state (EoS), ruling out several soft EoSs
favored by GW170817 event. In this work, we revisit the question of the maximum
mass of NSs considering a chameleon screening (thin-shell effect) on the NS
mass-radius relation, where the microscopic physics inside the NS is given by
realistic soft EoSs. We find that from appropriate and reasonable combination
of modified gravity, rotation effects and realistic soft EoSs, that it is
possible to achieve high masses and explain GW190814 secondary component, and
in return also NSs like PSR J0740+6620 (the most NS massive confirmed to date).
It is shown that gravity can play an important role in estimating maximum mass
of NSs, and even with soft EoSs, it is possible to generate very high masses.
Therefore, in this competition on the hydrostatic equilibrium between gravity
and EoS, some soft EoSs, in principle, cannot be completely be ruled out
without first taking into account gravitational effects.

a temperature that is constant over a measurement time window. Given a baseline
hohlraum design and a computational model, we train a deep neural network to
predict the time evolution of the radiation temperature as measured by the
Dante diagnostic. This enables us to rapidly explore design space and determine
the effect of adjusting design parameters. We also construct an ""inverse""

history of radiation temperature. Calculations using the machine learning model
demonstrate that improved performance over the baseline hohlraum would reduce
uncertainties in experimental opacity measurements.

are also upcoming for such models. For example, an attacker may carefully
construct images in specific ways (also referred to as adversarial examples)
aiming to mislead the DNN models to output incorrect classification results.
Similarly, many efforts are proposed to detect and mitigate adversarial
examples, usually for certain dedicated attacks. In this paper, we propose a
novel digital watermark-based method to generate image adversarial examples to
fool DNN models. Specifically, partial main features of the watermark image are
embedded into the host image almost invisibly, aiming to tamper with and damage
the recognition capabilities of the DNN models. We devise an efficient
mechanism to select host images and watermark images and utilize the improved
discrete wavelet transform (DWT) based Patchwork watermarking algorithm with a
set of valid hyperparameters to embed digital watermarks from the watermark
image dataset into original images for generating image adversarial examples.
The experimental results illustrate that the attack success rate on common DNN
models can reach an average of 95.47% on the CIFAR-10 dataset and the highest
at 98.71%. Besides, our scheme is able to generate a large number of
adversarial examples efficiently, concretely, an average of 1.17 seconds for
completing the attacks on each image on the CIFAR-10 dataset. In addition, we
design a baseline experiment using the watermark images generated by Gaussian
noise as the watermark image dataset that also displays the effectiveness of
our scheme. Similarly, we also propose the modified discrete cosine transform
(DCT) based Patchwork watermarking algorithm. To ensure repeatability and
reproducibility, the source code is available on GitHub.
