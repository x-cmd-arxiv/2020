Electronic structure and lattice relaxations are accurately described with
hybrid density functional theory. Calculations of capture coefficients provide
an additional validation of the accuracy of these functionals in dealing with
localized defect states. We also discuss the validity of the Condon
approximation, showing that even in the event of large lattice relaxations the
approximation is accurate. We test the method on

studied, the employed methods generally rely on normalized retention times as
well as m/z - mass to charge ratio of an ion values. Due to these limitations,
there is need for quantitative characterization methods which can be used
independently of m/z values, thus utilizing only normalized retention times. As
such, the primary goal of this article is to construct an LC-MS/MS based
classification of the permethylated glycans derived from standard glycoproteins
and human blood serum, using a Glucose Unit Index (GUI) as the reference frame
in the space of compound parameters. For the reference frame we develop a
closed-form analytic formula, which is obtained from the Green's function of a
relevant convection-diffusion-absorption equation used to model composite
material transport. The aforementioned equation is derived from an
Einstein-Brownian motion paradigm, which provides a physical interpretation of
the time-dependence at the point of observation for molecular transport in the
experiment. The necessary coefficients are determined via a data-driven
learning procedure. The methodology is presented in an abstract manner which
allows for immediate application to related physical and chemical processes.
Results employing the proposed classification method are validated via
comparison with experimental mass spectrometer data.

learned end-to-end. We build a general-purpose mechanism that enables agents to
generalize their language understanding to compositional domains. Crucially,
our network has the same state-of-the-art performance as prior work while
generalizing its knowledge when prior work does not. Our network also provides
a level of interpretability that enables users to inspect what each part of

we demonstrate the significant role that compositionality can play in achieving
that goal.

believed to be a primary process during which explosive energy release and
particle acceleration occur, leading to significant high-energy emission. Past
years have witnessed active development of kinetic modeling of relativistic
magnetic reconnection, supporting this magnetically dominated scenario. A much
less explored issue is the consequence of 3D dynamics, where turbulent
structures are naturally generated as various types of instabilities develop.
This paper presents a series of 3D, fully-kinetic simulations of relativistic
turbulent magnetic reconnection (RTMR) in positron-electron plasmas with system
domains much larger than kinetic scales. Our simulations start from a
force-free current sheet with several different modes of long wavelength
magnetic field perturbations, which drive additional turbulence in the
reconnection region. Because of this, the current layer breaks up and the
reconnection region quickly evolves into a turbulent layer filled with coherent
structures such as flux ropes and current sheets. We find that plasma dynamics
in RTMR is vastly different from their 2D counterparts in many aspects. The
flux ropes evolve rapidly after their generation, and can be completely
disrupted due to the secondary kink instability. This turbulent evolution leads
to superdiffusion behavior of magnetic field lines as seen in MHD studies of
turbulent reconnection. Meanwhile, nonthermal particle acceleration and
energy-release time scale can be very fast and do not strongly depend on the
turbulence amplitude. The main acceleration mechanism is a Fermi-like
acceleration process supported by the motional electric field, whereas the
non-ideal electric field acceleration plays a subdominant role. We discuss
possible observational implications of 3D RTMR in high-energy astrophysics.

additively separable piecewise linear concave (SPLC) utilities. A mixed manna
contains goods that everyone likes and bads that everyone dislikes, as well as
items that some like and others dislike. The seminal work of Bogomolnaia et al.
[Econometrica'17] argue why allocating a mixed manna is genuinely more
complicated than a good or a bad manna, and why competitive equilibrium is the
best mechanism. They also provide the existence of equilibrium and establish
its peculiar properties (e.g., non-convex and disconnected set of equilibria
even under linear utilities), but leave the problem of computing an equilibrium
open. This problem remained unresolved even for only bad manna under linear
utilities.
  Our main result is a simplex-like algorithm based on Lemke's scheme for
computing a competitive allocation of a mixed manna under SPLC utilities, a
strict generalization of linear. Experimental results on randomly generated
instances suggest that our algorithm will be fast in practice. The problem is
known to be PPAD-hard for the case of good manna, and we also show a similar
result for the case of bad manna. Given these PPAD-hardness results, designing
such an algorithm is the only non-brute-force (non-enumerative) option known,
e.g., the classic Lemke-Howson algorithm (1964) for computing a Nash
equilibrium in a 2-player game is still one of the most widely used algorithms
in practice.
  Our algorithm also yields several new structural properties as simple
corollaries. We obtain a (constructive) proof of existence for a far more
general setting, membership of the problem in PPAD, rational-valued solution,
and odd number of solutions property. The last property also settles the
conjecture of Bogomolnaia et al. in the affirmative.

homology sphere admits a contact type embedding in $R^4$, a result that has
bearing on conjectures of Gompf and Koll\'ar. This implies in particular that
no rationally convex domain in $C^2$ has boundary diffeomorphic to a Brieskorn

Stein domains but not symplectically convex ones; in particular we find Stein
domains in $C^2$ that cannot be made Weinstein with respect to the ambient

that produce multiple transits during one conjunction with eclipsing binary
systems. The occurrence of these transits enables us to estimate the
candidates' orbital periods, which is crucial as the periods of the currently
known transiting circumbinary planets are significantly longer than the typical
observational baseline of TESS. Combined with the derived radii, it also
provides valuable information needed for follow-up observations and subsequent
confirmation of a large number of circumbinary planet candidates from TESS.
Motivated by the discovery of the 1108-day circumbinary planet Kepler-1647, we
show the application of this technique to four of Kepler's circumbinary planets
that produce such transits. Our results indicate that in systems where the
circumbinary planet is on a low-eccentricity orbit, the estimated planetary
orbital period is within <10-20% of the true value. This estimate is derived
from photometric observations spanning less than 5% of the planet's period,
demonstrating the strong capability of the technique. Capitalizing on the
current and future eclipsing binaries monitored by NASA's TESS mission, we
estimate that hundreds of circumbinary planets candidates producing multiple
transits during one conjunction will be detected in the TESS data. Such a large
sample will enable statistical understanding of the population of planets
orbiting binary stars and shed new light on their formation and evolution.

group similar events in the early stages of the data analysis, thereby
improving efficiency by limiting the computationally expensive processing of
unnecessary events. The application of unsupervised clustering algorithms to
the analysis of two-dimensional projections of particle tracks from a resonant
proton scattering experiment on $^{46}$Ar is introduced. We explore the
performance of autoencoder neural networks and a pre-trained VGG16
convolutional neural network. We study clustering performance on both data from
a simulated $^{46}$Ar experiment, and real events from the AT-TPC detector. We
find that a $k$-means algorithm applied to simulated data in the VGG16 latent
space forms almost perfect clusters. Additionally, the VGG16+$k$-means approach
finds high purity clusters of proton events for real experimental data. We also
explore the application of clustering the latent space of autoencoder neural
networks for event separation. While these networks show strong performance,
they suffer from high variability in their results.

assume that errors in feature extraction and matching are independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d), but this assumption is known to not be true --
features extracted from low-contrast regions of images exhibit wider error
distributions than features from sharp corners. Furthermore, V-SLAM algorithms
are prone to catastrophic tracking failures when sensed images include
challenging conditions such as specular reflections, lens flare, or shadows of
dynamic objects. To address such failures, previous work has focused on
building more robust visual frontends, to filter out challenging features. In
this paper, we present introspective vision for SLAM (IV-SLAM), a fundamentally
different approach for addressing these challenges. IV-SLAM explicitly models
the noise process of reprojection errors from visual features to be
context-dependent, and hence non-i.i.d. We introduce an autonomously supervised
approach for IV-SLAM to collect training data to learn such a context-aware
noise model. Using this learned noise model, IV-SLAM guides feature extraction
to select more features from parts of the image that are likely to result in
lower noise, and further incorporate the learned noise model into the joint
maximum likelihood estimation, thus making it robust to the aforementioned
types of errors. We present empirical results to demonstrate that IV-SLAM 1) is
able to accurately predict sources of error in input images, 2) reduces
tracking error compared to V-SLAM, and 3) increases the mean distance between
tracking failures by more than 70% on challenging real robot data compared to

This sequence is known for its mysterious quasi-periodic behavior and its
surprising rigidity when we let $a_2$ vary. This definition can be generalized

called JDNet, to solve the single image deraining problem and conduct the
segmentation and detection task for applications. Specifically, considering the
important information on multi-scale features, we propose a Scale-Aggregation
module to learn the features with different scales. Simultaneously,
Self-Attention module is introduced to match or outperform their convolutional
counterparts, which allows the feature aggregation to adapt to each channel.
Furthermore, to improve the basic convolutional feature transformation process
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Self-Calibrated convolution is applied
to build long-range spatial and inter-channel dependencies around each spatial
location that explicitly expand fields-of-view of each convolutional layer
through internal communications and hence enriches the output features. By
designing the Scale-Aggregation and Self-Attention modules with Self-Calibrated
convolution skillfully, the proposed model has better deraining results both on
real-world and synthetic datasets. Extensive experiments are conducted to
demonstrate the superiority of our method compared with state-of-the-art

on gravitational waves (GWs). When we consider GWs in a coherently oscillating
axion cloud, we confirm that significant resonant amplification of GWs occurs
in a narrow frequency band, and the amplification is restricted to the late
epoch after the passage of the incident waves. We also identify the condition
that an axion cloud spontaneously emits GWs. Once we take into account the
randomness of the spatial phase distribution of the axion oscillations, we find
that the amplification is suppressed compared with the coherent case, but
significant amplification of GWs can still occur. We also examine whether or
not the amplification of GWs is possible in the present universe, taking into
account the history of the universe. We find that resonant amplification is
difficult to be tested from GW observations in the standard scenario of the
axion DM model, in which the axion is the dominant component of DM. However,
there is some parameter window in which the resonant amplification of GWs might
be observed, if the axion is subdominant component of DM, and the axion cloud
formation is delayed until the Hubble rate becomes much smaller than the axion
mass.

using single-species models. Many of these models are based upon statistical
techniques and are good at assessing the current state and making short-term
predictions; however, as they do not model interactions between stocks, they
lack predictive power on longer timescales. Additionally, there are mechanistic
multi-species models that represent key biological processes and consider
interactions between stocks such as predation and competition for resources.
Due to the complexity of these models, they are difficult to fit to data, and
so many mechanistic multi-species models depend upon single-species models
where they exist, or ad hoc assumptions when they don't, for parameters such as
annual fishing mortality. In this paper we demonstrate that by taking a
state-space approach, many of the uncertain parameters can be treated
dynamically, allowing us to fit, with quantifiable uncertainty, mechanistic
multi-species models directly to data. We demonstrate this by fitting uncertain
parameters, including annual fishing mortality, of a size-based multi-species
model of the Celtic Sea, for species with and without single-species
stock-assessments. Consequently, errors in the single-species models no longer
propagate through the multi-species model and underlying assumptions are more
transparent. Building mechanistic multi-species models that are internally
consistent, with quantifiable uncertainty, will improve their credibility and
utility for management. This may lead to their uptake by being either used to
corroborate single-species models; directly in the advice process to make
predictions into the future; or used to provide a new way of managing

increasingly being used in medical imaging to provide clinically plausible
explanations for the decisions the neural network makes. However, the utility
and robustness of these visualization maps has not yet been rigorously examined
in the context of medical imaging. We posit that trustworthiness in this
context requires 1) localization utility, 2) sensitivity to model weight
randomization, 3) repeatability, and 4) reproducibility. Using the localization
information available in two large public radiology datasets, we quantify the
performance of eight commonly used saliency map approaches for the above

imaging warrants additional scrutiny and recommend that detection or

variational two-electron reduced density matrix (2-RDM) theory to compute the
energies and properties of strongly correlated periodic systems. The 2-RDM of
the unit cell is directly computed subject to necessary $N$-representability
conditions such that the unit-cell 2-RDM represents at least one $N$-electron

capture the strong (static) correlation effects in either of these molecular

metal-to-insulator transition in the hydrogen chains and the length-dependent
polyradical formation in acenes. For both hydrogen chains and acenes the
periodic calculations are compared with previous non-periodic calculations with
the results showing a significant change in energies and increase in the

bounds for the deterministic message complexity of leader election algorithms
(regardless of time), proven by Korach, Moran, and Zaks (TCS, 1989) for
asynchronous algorithms and by Afek and Gafni (SIAM J. Comput., 1991) for
synchronous networks. Hence, our result also separates the message complexities
of randomized and deterministic leader election. More importantly, our
(randomized) time complexity of $O(\log^2 n)$ for obtaining the optimal $O(n)$
message complexity is significantly smaller than the long-standing
$\tilde{\Theta}(n)$ time complexity obtained by Afek and Gafni and by Singh

(NISQ) devices and especially variational quantum circuits (VQC) have recently

Inspired by classical deep learning, VQCs are trained by gradient descent
methods which allow for efficient training over big parameter spaces. For NISQ
sized circuits, such methods show good convergence. There are however still
many open questions related to the convergence of the loss function and to the
trainability of these circuits in situations of vanishing gradients.
Furthermore, it is not clear how ""good"" the minima are in terms of
generalization and stability against perturbations of the data and there is,
therefore, a need for tools to quantitatively study the convergence of the
VQCs. In this work, we introduce a way to compute the Hessian of the loss
function of VQCs and show how to characterize the loss landscape with it. The
eigenvalues of the Hessian give information on the local curvature and we
discuss how this information can be interpreted and compared to classical
neural networks. We benchmark our results on several examples, starting with a
simple analytic toy model to provide some intuition about the behavior of the
Hessian, then going to bigger circuits, and also train VQCs on data. Finally,
we show how the Hessian can be used to adjust the learning rate for faster
convergence during the training of variational circuits.

Learning a new task often requires both exploring to gather task-relevant
information and exploiting this information to solve the task. In principle,
optimal exploration and exploitation can be learned end-to-end by simply
maximizing task performance. However, such meta-RL approaches struggle with
local optima due to a chicken-and-egg problem: learning to explore requires
good exploitation to gauge the exploration's utility, but learning to exploit
requires information gathered via exploration. Optimizing separate objectives
for exploration and exploitation can avoid this problem, but prior meta-RL
exploration objectives yield suboptimal policies that gather information
irrelevant to the task. We alleviate both concerns by constructing an
exploitation objective that automatically identifies task-relevant information
and an exploration objective to recover only this information. This avoids
local optima in end-to-end training, without sacrificing optimal exploration.

then leverage this canonicalization to learn a spatiotemporal latent
representation using neural ordinary differential equations and a generative
model of dynamically evolving shapes using continuous normalizing flows. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several applications including
shape reconstruction, camera pose estimation, continuous spatiotemporal
sequence reconstruction, and correspondence estimation from irregularly or
intermittently sampled observations.

by applying nonequilibrium electronic spin density at one of its surfaces, so
that their propagation across AFI deprived of conduction electrons eventually
leads to reversal of magnetization of a ferromagnetic metal (FM) attached to
the opposite surface of AFI. We employ a recently developed time-dependent
nonequilibrium Green functions combined with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
equation (TDNEGF+LLG) formalism to evolve conduction electrons
quantum-mechanically while they interact via self-consistent back-action with
localized magnetic moments described classically by atomistic spin dynamics
solving a system of LLG equations. Upon injection of square current pulse as
the initial condition, TDNEGF+LLG simulations of FM-polarizer/AFI/FM-analyzer
junctions show that reversal of localized magnetic moments within FM-analyzer
is less efficient, in the sense of requiring larger pulse height and its longer
duration, than conventional electron-mediated STT (ESTT) driving magnetization
switching in standard FM-polarizer/normal-metal/FM-analyzer spin valve. Since
both electronic, generated by spin pumping from AFI, and magnonic, generated by
direct transmission from AFI, spin currents are injected into the FM-analyzer,
its localized magnetic moments will experience combined MSTT and ESTT.
Nevertheless, by artificially turning off ESTT we demonstrate that MSTT plays a
dominant role whose understanding, therefore, paves the way for
all-magnon-driven magnetization switching devices with no electronic parts.

the valley polarization. In combination with disorder, this mixing is prone to
open a new valley relaxation channel which attains significance with increasing
cavity coupling. Importantly, we show that optical cavities with an asymmetric

quantum systems in quantum optics, condensed matter, and high energy physics.
However, symmetry breaking in open systems is less thoroughly understood, in
part due to the richer steady-state and symmetry structure that such systems
possess. For the prototypical open system---a Lindbladian---a unitary symmetry
can be imposed in a ""weak"" or a ""strong"" way. We characterize the possible
$\mathbb{Z}_n$ symmetry breaking transitions for both cases. In the case of
$\mathbb{Z}_2$, a weak-symmetry-broken phase guarantees at most a classical bit
steady-state structure, while a strong-symmetry-broken phase admits a
partially-protected steady-state qubit. Viewing photonic cat qubits through the
lens of strong-symmetry breaking, we show how to dynamically recover the
logical information after any gap-preserving strong-symmetric error; such
recovery becomes perfect exponentially quickly in the number of photons. Our
study forges a connection between driven-dissipative phase transitions and
error correction.

in three CANDELS fields. We exploit deep multi-band HST imaging to derive
accurate mass profiles and color gradients, then use an empirical calibration
from rest-frame UVJ colors to estimate galaxy ages. We find that -- contrary to
previous results -- the youngest quiescent galaxies are not significantly
smaller than older quiescent galaxies at fixed stellar mass. These
`post-starburst' galaxies only appear smaller in half-light radii because they
have systematically flatter color gradients. The strength of color gradients in
quiescent galaxies is a clear function of age, with older galaxies exhibiting
stronger negative color gradients (i.e., redder centers). Furthermore, we find
that the central mass surface density $\Sigma_1$ is independent of age at fixed
stellar mass, and only weakly depends on redshift. This finding implies that
the central mass profiles of quiescent galaxies do not significantly change
with age; however, we find that older quiescent galaxies have additional mass
at large radii. Our results support the idea that building a massive core is a
necessary requirement for quenching beyond $z=1$, and indicate that
post-starburst galaxies are the result of a rapid quenching process that
requires structural change. Furthermore, our observed color gradient and mass
profile evolution supports a scenario where quiescent galaxies grow inside-out
via minor mergers.

dephasing dynamics is Markovian while the joint dynamics displays non-Markovian

displays rich dynamical features with distinct alternatives: Only one path
displaying non-Markovian memory effects, both paths individually displaying
them, or no memory effects appearing at all. Our results also illustrate that
measuring the photon's path can either create or destroy non-Markovian memory
effects depending on whether the measurement takes place in or outside the

difference inside the interferometer by studying non-Markovianity outside the

introduce dissipative features for the open system dynamics even though the

of SVS4 and directly measured CO and CH$_3$OH gas-to-ice ratios. The CH$_3$OH
gas-to-ice ratio agrees with values that were previously reported for embedded

of SVS4: the Class 0 protostar SMM4 and its envelope lie in the vicinity, and
the outflow associated with SMM4 intersects the cluster. This study serves as a
pathfinder for future observations with ALMA and the James Webb Space Telescope
that will provide high-sensitivity gas-ice maps of molecules more complex than
methanol. Such comparative maps will be essential to constrain the chemical
routes that regulate the chemical complexity in star-forming regions.

The group of CP2 stars, which encompasses classical Ap and Bp stars, exhibits
strictly periodic light, spectral, and spectropolarimetric variations that can
be adequately explained by the model of a rigidly rotating star with persistent
surface structures and a stable global magnetic field. Using observations from
the Kepler K2 mission, we find that the B9pSi star HD 174356 displays a light
curve both variable in amplitude and shape, which is not expected in a CP2
star. Employing archival and new photometric and spectroscopic observations, we
carry out a detailed abundance analysis of HD 174356 and discuss its
photometric and astrophysical properties in detail. We employ phenomenological
modeling to decompose the light curve and the observed radial velocity
variability. Our abundance analysis confirms that HD 174356 is a silicon-type
CP2 star. No magnetic field stronger than 110G was found. The star's light
curve can be interpreted as the sum of two independent strictly periodic
signals with P1 = 4.04355(5)d and P2 = 2.11169(3)d. The periods have remained
stable over 17 years of observations. In all spectra, HD 174356 appears to be
single-lined. From the simulation of the variability characteristics and
investigation of stars in the close angular vicinity, we put forth the
hypothesis that the peculiar light variability of HD 174356 arises in a single

fundamental challenges such as object occlusion, small-scale objects,
background clutter, and abrupt camera motion. To tackle these difficulties, we
propose to integrate the 3D structure of the observed scene into a
detection-by-tracking algorithm. We introduce a pipeline that combines a
model-free visual object tracker, a sparse 3D reconstruction, and a state
estimator. The 3D reconstruction of the scene is computed with an image-based
Structure-from-Motion (SfM) component that enables us to leverage a state
estimator in the corresponding 3D scene during tracking. By representing the
position of the target in 3D space rather than in image space, we stabilize the
tracking during ego-motion and improve the handling of occlusions, background
clutter, and small-scale objects. We evaluated our approach on prototypical
image sequences, captured from a UAV with low-altitude oblique views. For this
purpose, we adapted an existing dataset for visual object tracking and
reconstructed the observed scene in 3D. The experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed approach outperforms methods using plain visual cues as well
as approaches leveraging image-space-based state estimations. We believe that
our approach can be beneficial for traffic monitoring, video surveillance, and
navigation.

pulsation amplitudes are strongly modulated with orbital phase. Stars in close
binaries are tidally distorted, so we examine how a star's tidally induced
asphericity affects its oscillation mode frequencies and eigenfunctions. We
explain the pulsation amplitude modulation via tidal mode coupling such that
the pulsations are effectively confined to certain regions of the star, e.g.,
the tidal pole or the tidal equator. In addition to a rigorous mathematical
formalism to compute this coupling, we provide a more intuitive semi-analytic
description of the process. We discuss three resulting effects: 1. Tidal
alignment, i.e., the alignment of oscillation modes about the tidal axis rather
than the rotation axis; 2. Tidal trapping, e.g., the confinement of
oscillations near the tidal poles or the tidal equator; 3. Tidal amplification,
i.e., increased flux perturbations near the tidal poles where acoustic modes
can propagate closer to the surface of the star. Together, these phenomena can
account for the pulsation amplitude and phase modulation of the recently
discovered class of ""tidally tilted pulsators."" We compare our theory to the
three tidally tilted pulsators HD 74423, CO Cam, and TIC 63328020, finding that

change the user's internal beliefs or their internal state estimation process,
our insight is that we can still assist them by modifying the user's

synthesize new observations that lead to more accurate internal state estimates

estimation (ASE): an automated assistant uses the true observations to infer
the state of the world, then generates a modified observation for the user to
consume (e.g., through an augmented reality interface), and optimizes the
modification to induce the user's new beliefs to match the assistant's current
beliefs. We evaluate ASE in a user study with 12 participants who each perform
four tasks: two tasks with known user biases -- bandwidth-limited image
classification and a driving video game with observation delay -- and two with
unknown biases that our method has to learn -- guided 2D navigation and a lunar
lander teleoperation video game. A different assistance strategy emerges in
each domain, such as quickly revealing informative pixels to speed up image
classification, using a dynamics model to undo observation delay in driving,
identifying nearby landmarks for navigation, and exaggerating a visual
indicator of tilt in the lander game. The results show that ASE substantially
improves the task performance of users with bandwidth constraints, observation

wide peaks appear and the main peak of microlensing light curve is flattened.
(ii) In microlensing events with the lens impact parameters larger than the
disc inner radius, the disc can break the symmetry of light curves with respect

the discs produce wide peaks right before entering and immediately after
exiting from the caustic curves. (iv) The disc-induced perturbations are larger

nanocrystal superlattices under room temperature and cryogenic
micro-photoluminescence spectroscopy. It is shown that keeping such structures
under vacuum, a gradual contraction of the superlattices and subsequent
coalescence of the nanocrystals occurs over several days. As a result, a
narrow, low energy emission peak is observed at 4 K with a concomitant
shortening of the photoluminescence lifetime due to the energy transfer between
nanocrystals. When exposed to air, self-assembled CsPbBr3 nanocrystals develop
bulk-like CsPbBr3 particles on top of the superlattices. At 4 K, these
particles produce a distribution of narrow, low energy emission peaks with
short lifetimes and excitation fluence-dependent, oscillatory decays,
resembling the features of superfluorescence. Overall, the reactivity of
CsPbBr3 nanocrystals dramatically alters the emission of their assemblies,
which should not be overlooked when studying collective optoelectronic
properties nor confused with superfluorescence effects.

ultracold atoms and syntheticdimensions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 030504 (2020)].
Conceptually, the scheme is based on the idea that aphysical monolayer optical
lattice of desired geometry is upgraded to a synthetic bilayer system by
identifyingthe internal states of the trapped atoms with synthetic spatial
dimensions. The couplings between the internalstates, i.e. between sites on the
two layers, can be exquisitely controlled by laser induced Raman transitions.By
spatially modulating the interlayer coupling, Moir\'e-like patterns can be
directly imprinted on the latticewithout the need of a physical twist of the
layers. This scheme leads practically to a uniform pattern across thelattice
with the added advantage of widely tunable interlayer coupling strengths. The
latter feature facilitates theengineering of flat bands at larger ""magic""
angles, or more directly, for smaller unit cells than in conventionaltwisted
materials. In this paper we extend these ideas and demonstrate that our system
exhibits topologicalband structures under appropriate conditions. To achieve
non-trivial band topology we consider imanaginarynext-to-nearest neighbor
tunnelings that drive the system into a quantum anomalous Hall phase. In
particular,we focus on three groups of bands, whose their Chern numbers triplet
can be associated to a trivial insulator(0,0,0), a standard non-trivial
(-1,0,1) and a non-standard non-trivial (-1,1,0). We identify regimes of
parameterswhere these three situations occur. We show the presence of an
anomalous Hall phase and the appearance oftopological edge states. Our works

server-agent network. In this problem, the system comprises multiple agents,
each having a set of local data points, that are connected to a server. The
goal for the agents is to compute a linear mathematical model that optimally
fits the collective data points held by all the agents, without sharing their
individual local data points. This goal can be achieved, in principle, using
the server-agent variant of the traditional iterative gradient-descent method.
The gradient-descent method converges linearly to a solution, and its rate of
convergence is lower bounded by the conditioning of the agents' collective data
points. If the data points are ill-conditioned, the gradient-descent method may
require a large number of iterations to converge.
  We propose an iterative pre-conditioning technique that mitigates the
deleterious effect of the conditioning of data points on the rate of
convergence of the gradient-descent method. We rigorously show that the
resulting pre-conditioned gradient-descent method, with the proposed iterative
pre-conditioning, achieves superlinear convergence when the least-squares
problem has a unique solution. In general, the convergence is linear with
improved rate of convergence in comparison to the traditional gradient-descent
method and the state-of-the-art accelerated gradient-descent methods. We
further illustrate the improved rate of convergence of our proposed algorithm
through experiments on different real-world least-squares problems in both
noise-free and noisy computation environment.

about domains in which objects are described not only by attributes but also by

possible ways to specify classes of objects in such domains is to use concepts
in fuzzy DLs. As DLs are variants of modal logics, indiscernibility in DLs is
characterized by bisimilarity. The bisimilarity relation of an interpretation
is the largest auto-bisimulation of that interpretation. In DLs and their fuzzy

this paper, we define and study fuzzy bisimulation and bisimilarity for fuzzy

shaping. Few-GHz radio-frequency digital-to-analog converters (RF DACs) present
a more economical avenue for high-fidelity control while simultaneously
providing greater command over the spectrum of the synthesized signal. Modern
RF DACs with extra-wide bandwidths are able to directly synthesize tones above
their sampling rates, thereby keeping the system clock rate at a level
compatible with modern digital logic systems while still being able to generate
high-frequency pulses with arbitrary profiles. We have incorporated custom
superconducting qubit control logic into off-the-shelf hardware capable of
low-noise pulse synthesis up to 7.5 GHz using an RF DAC clocked at 5 GHz. Our
approach enables highly linear and stable microwave synthesis over a wide
bandwidth, giving rise to high-resolution control and a reduced number of
required signal sources per qubit. We characterize the performance of the
hardware using a five-transmon superconducting device and demonstrate
consistently reduced two-qubit gate error (as low as 1.8%) which we show
results from superior control chain linearity compared to traditional
configurations. The exceptional flexibility and stability further establish a
foundation for scalable quantum control beyond intermediate-scale devices.

platforms, identifying malicious activity and coordinated campaigns is
essential to ensuring a robust democratic environment. Twitter has become a
critical communication channel for politicians and other public figures,
enabling them to maintain a direct relationship with supporters. However, the
platform has been fertile ground for large-scale malicious activity. As the
2020 U.S. presidential election approaches, we have developed tools to monitor
follower dynamics of some of the most prominent Twitter users, including U.S.
presidential candidates. We investigate numerous, strange phenomena, such as
dramatic spike and saw-tooth waveforms on follower-count charts; cohorts of
user accounts which 'circulate', i.e., re-follow high profile accounts numerous
times; and other 'resurrected' accounts, which have recently re-engaged on
Twitter after years of non-activity. So through various analyses in these
contexts, we reveal multiple, coordinated 'social' targeting campaigns aimed at
affecting the outcomes of socially critical events through the use of networks
of social automations (bots), often optimizing their social capital through
'compromised' accounts, which have--unbeknownst to the greater world--been

tasks, is critical to user experience. Generally it has two steps: generating
completed query candidates according to query prefixes, and ranking them based
on extracted features. Three major challenges are observed for a query auto
completion system: (1) QAC has a strict online latency requirement. For each
keystroke, results must be returned within tens of milliseconds, which poses a
significant challenge in designing sophisticated language models for it. (2)
For unseen queries, generated candidates are of poor quality as contextual
information is not fully utilized. (3) Traditional QAC systems heavily rely on
handcrafted features such as the query candidate frequency in search logs,
lacking sufficient semantic understanding of the candidate.
  In this paper, we propose an efficient neural QAC system with effective
context modeling to overcome these challenges. On the candidate generation
side, this system uses as much information as possible in unseen prefixes to
generate relevant candidates, increasing the recall by a large margin. On the
candidate ranking side, an unnormalized language model is proposed, which
effectively captures deep semantics of queries. This approach presents better
ranking performance over state-of-the-art neural ranking methods and reduces

absence of visual training data for a part of the classes from a dataset. When
the number of classes is large, classes are usually represented by semantic
class prototypes learned automatically from unannotated text collections. This
typically leads to much lower performances than with manually designed semantic
prototypes such as attributes. While most ZSL works focus on the visual aspect
and reuse standard semantic prototypes learned from generic text collections,
we focus on the problem of semantic class prototype design for large scale ZSL.
More specifically, we investigate the use of noisy textual metadata associated
to photos as text collections, as we hypothesize they are likely to provide
more plausible semantic embeddings for visual classes if exploited
appropriately. We thus make use of a source-based voting strategy to improve
the robustness of semantic prototypes. Evaluation on the large scale ImageNet

perturbations under the $\ell_p$ metric, Wasserstein distance, which takes
geometry in pixel space into account, has long been known to be a suitable
metric for measuring image quality and has recently risen as a compelling
alternative to the $\ell_p$ metric in adversarial attacks. However,
constructing an effective attack under the Wasserstein metric is
computationally much more challenging and calls for better optimization
algorithms. We address this gap in two ways: (a) we develop an exact yet
efficient projection operator to enable a stronger projected gradient attack;
(b) we show that the Frank-Wolfe method equipped with a suitable linear
minimization oracle works extremely fast under Wasserstein constraints. Our
algorithms not only converge faster but also generate much stronger attacks.
For instance, we decrease the accuracy of a residual network on CIFAR-10 to
$3.4\%$ within a Wasserstein perturbation ball of radius $0.005$, in contrast
to $65.6\%$ using the previous Wasserstein attack based on an
\emph{approximate} projection operator. Furthermore, employing our stronger

Autistic patients struggle with social skills, repetitive behaviors, and
communication, both verbal and nonverbal. Although the disease is considered to
be genetic, the highest rates of accurate diagnosis occur when the child is
tested on behavioral characteristics and facial features. Patients have a
common pattern of distinct facial deformities, allowing researchers to analyze
only an image of the child to determine if the child has the disease. While
there are other techniques and models used for facial analysis and autism
classification on their own, our proposal bridges these two ideas allowing
classification in a cheaper, more efficient method. Our deep learning model
uses MobileNet and two dense layers in order to perform feature extraction and
image classification. The model is trained and tested using 3,014 images,
evenly split between children with autism and children without it. 90% of the
data is used for training, and 10% is used for testing. Based on our accuracy,

for the changing scale. We find that double CORDIC iterations are
self-correcting and compensate possible wrong rotations in subsequent
iterations. The algorithm needs 75\% more iterations and delivers the eccentric
anomaly and its sine and cosine terms times the eccentricity. The algorithm can
be adopted for the hyperbolic case, too. The new shift-and-add algorithm brings
Kepler's equation close to hardware and allows to solve it with cheap and
simple hardware components.

region. The primary question we explore is: How can we move from one tiling to
another? Tiling spaces can be viewed as spaces of subgraphs of a fixed graph
with a fixed degree sequence. Moves to connect such spaces have been explored
in algebraic statistics. Thus, we approach this question from an applied
algebra viewpoint, making new connections between domino tilings, algebraic
statistics, and toric algebra. Using results from toric ideals of graphs, we
are able to describe moves that connect the tiling space of a given cubiculated
region of any dimension. This is done by studying binomials that arise from two
distinct domino tilings of the same region. Additionally, we introduce tiling
ideals and flip ideals and use these ideals to restate what it means for a
tiling space to be flip connected. Finally, we show that if $R$ is a
$2$-dimensional simply connected cubiculated region, any binomial arising from
two distinct tilings of $R$ can be written in terms of quadratic binomials. As
a corollary to our main result, we obtain an alternative proof to the fact that
the set of domino tilings of a $2$-dimensional simply connected region is
connected by flips.

current methods present two drawbacks. First, they lack precision compared with
optical tweezers or AFM. Second, the dependence of their signal upon the

  Here, we introduce a new optical technique that circumvents both issues and
allows for a simple, versatile and efficient 3D tracking of diluted particles
while offering a sub-nanometer frame-to-frame precision in all three spatial
directions. The principle is to combine stereoscopy and interferometry, such
that the z (axial) position is measured through the distance between two
interferometric fringe patterns. The linearity of this stereoscopy technique
alleviates the need for lookup tables while the structured interferometric
pattern enhances precision. On the other hand, the extended spatial footprint
of this PSF maximizes the number of photons detected per frame without the need
of fancy cameras, nor the need for complex hardware. Hence, thanks to its
simplicity and versatility, we believe that SDI (Stereo Darkfield
Interferometry) technology has the potential to significantly enhance the
spreading of 3D tracking.
  We demonstrate the efficiency of this technique on various single-molecule
measurements thanks to magnetic tweezers. In particular we demonstrate the
precise quantification of two-state dynamics involving axial steps as short as
1 nm. We then show that SDI can be directly embedded in a commercial objective

demonstrate early-warning signals when they approach phase transitions
responding to external perturbation, including crises, policy changes, and
human behavior changes. In urban systems, population visits to POIs represent a
state in the complex systems that are cities. These states may undergo phase
transitions due to population response to pandemic risks and intervention
policies. In this study, we conducted early-warning signal detection on
population visits to POIs to examine population response to pandemic risks. We
examined two early-warning signals, the increase of autocorrelation at-lag-1
and standard deviation, in time series of population visits to POIs in 17
metropolitan cities in the United States of America. The results show that: (1)
early-warning signals for population response to COVID-19 were detected between
February 14 and March 11, 2020 in 17 cities; (2) detected population response
had started prior to shelter-in-place orders in 17 cities; (3) early-warning
signals detected from the essential POIs visits appeared earlier than those
from non-essential POIs; and 4) longer time lags between detected population
response and shelter-in-place orders led to a less decrease in POI visits. The
results show the importance of detecting early-warning signals during crises in
cities as complex systems. Early-warning signals could provide important
insights regarding the timing and extent of population response to crises to
inform policy makers.

length and time scales. A long-standing question looms over pair diffusion of
particles in close proximity i.e. particle pair diffusion at small separations:
what range of turbulence length scales governs pair diffusion? Here, we attempt
to answer this question by addressing pair diffusion by both fine scales and
larger scale coherent structures in which the fine scales are embedded - we
unavoidably encounter a combination of both local and non-local interactions
associated with the small and large length scales. The local structures possess
length scales of the same order of magnitude as the pair separation $l$, and
they induce strong relative motion between the particle pair. However, the
non-local structures, possessing length scales much larger than $l$, also
induce (via Biot-Savart) significant relative motion, an effect ignored in
prior studies (based on Richardson-Obukhov R-O theory). This fundamentally
changes the interpretation of the pair diffusion process, giving the pair
diffusivity $K$ scaling as $K\sim l^{1.556}$ -- agreeing within $1\%$ of data.
The `R-O constant' $g_l$ is shown to be not a constant, although widely assumed
to be a constant. However, new constants (representing pair diffusivity $G_K$
and pair separation $G_l$) are identified, which we show to asymptote to
$G_K\approx 0.73$ and $G_l\sim 0.01$ at high Reynolds numbers. As an
application, we show that the radius of a cloud of droplets in a spray is
smaller by an order of magnitude as compared to R-O theory.

  Calibration of Time Interleaved ADC for Digital Communication Receivers","11 pages, 15 figures",,,,"eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper introduces a backpropagation-based technique for the calibration
of the mismatch errors of time-interleaved analog to digital converters
(TI-ADCs). This technique is applicable to digital receivers such as those used
in coherent optical communications. The error at the slicer of the receiver is
processed using a modified version of the well known backpropagation algorithm
from machine learning. The processed slicer error can be directly applied to
compensate the TI-ADC mismatch errors with an adaptive equalizer, or it can be
used to digitally estimate and correct said mismatch errors using analog
techniques such as delay cells and programmable gain amplifiers (PGA). The main
advantages of the technique proposed here compared to prior art are its
robustness, its speed of convergence, and the fact that it always works in
background mode, independently of the oversampling factor and the properties of
the input signal, as long as the receiver converges. Moreover, this technique
enables the joint compensation of impairments not addressed by traditional
TI-ADC calibration techniques, such as I/Q skew in quadrature modulation
receivers. Simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
technique, and low complexity implementation options are discussed.

reproducing kernel-based approach for estimation and inference of ODE given
noisy observations. We do not assume the functional forms in ODE to be known,
or restrict them to be linear or additive, and we allow pairwise interactions.
We perform sparse estimation to select individual functionals, and construct
confidence intervals for the estimated signal trajectories. We establish the
estimation optimality and selection consistency of kernel ODE under both the
low-dimensional and high-dimensional settings, where the number of unknown
functionals can be smaller or larger than the sample size. Our proposal builds
upon the smoothing spline analysis of variance (SS-ANOVA) framework, but
tackles several important problems that are not yet fully addressed, and thus
extends the scope of existing SS-ANOVA too. We demonstrate the efficacy of our
method through numerous ODE examples.

separation, but molecular interactions of disordered protein regions are not

protein regions drive phase separation. Given the critical role of phase
separation in many cellular processes, and that dysfunction of phase separation
can lead to debilitating diseases, it is important that we understand the
interactions and sequence properties underlying phase behavior. A conceptual
framework that divides IDRs into interacting and solvating regions has proven
particularly useful, and analytical instantiations and coarse-grained models
can test our understanding of the driving forces against experimental phase

  Detection","The IJCV version extended significantly from our ECCV2020 conference
  paper",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is important to human-centric scene
understanding tasks. Existing works tend to assume that the same verb has
similar visual characteristics in different HOI categories, an approach that
ignores the diverse semantic meanings of the verb. To address this issue, in
this paper, we propose a novel Polysemy Deciphering Network (PD-Net) that
decodes the visual polysemy of verbs for HOI detection in three distinct ways.
First, we refine features for HOI detection to be polysemyaware through the use
of two novel modules: namely, Language Prior-guided Channel Attention (LPCA)
and Language Prior-based Feature Augmentation (LPFA). LPCA highlights important
elements in human and object appearance features for each HOI category to be
identified; moreover, LPFA augments human pose and spatial features for HOI
detection using language priors, enabling the verb classifiers to receive
language hints that reduce intra-class variation for the same verb. Second, we
introduce a novel Polysemy-Aware Modal Fusion module (PAMF), which guides
PD-Net to make decisions based on feature types deemed more important according
to the language priors. Third, we propose to relieve the verb polysemy problem
through sharing verb classifiers for semantically similar HOI categories.
Furthermore, to expedite research on the verb polysemy problem, we build a new
benchmark dataset named HOI-VerbPolysemy (HOIVP), which includes common verbs
(predicates) that have diverse semantic meanings in the real world. Finally,
through deciphering the visual polysemy of verbs, our approach is demonstrated
to outperform state-of-the-art methods by significant margins on the HICO-DET,
V-COCO, and HOI-VP databases. Code and data in this paper are available at

used in intelligent vehicle systems to improve road safety, ride comfort, and
fuel economy. However, vehicle heterogeneity and parameter uncertainty make it
extremely difficult for a single vehicle to accurately and reliably measure
such information. In this work, we propose a unified framework for
learning-based collaborative estimation to fuse local road estimation from a
fleet of connected heterogeneous vehicles. The collaborative estimation scheme
exploits the sequential measurements made by multiple vehicles traversing the
same road segment and let these vehicles relay a learning signal to iteratively
refine local estimations. Given that the privacy of individual vehicles'
identity must be protected in collaborative estimation, we directly incorporate
privacy-protection design into the collaborative estimation design and
establish a unified framework for privacy-preserving collaborative estimation.
Different from patching conventional privacy mechanisms like differential
privacy which will compromise algorithmic accuracy or homomorphic encryption
which will incur heavy communication/computational overhead, we leverage the
dynamical properties of collective estimation to enable inherent privacy
protection without sacrificing accuracy or significantly increasing
communication/computation overhead. Numerical simulations confirm the
effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed framework.

top-K items given a query, learn directly from a large training set of (query,
item) pairs. However, they are often insufficient when there are many
previously unseen (query, item) combinations, often referred to as the cold
start problem. Furthermore, the search system can be biased towards items that
are frequently shown to a query previously, also known as the 'rich get richer'
(a.k.a. feedback loop) problem. In light of these problems, we observed that
most online content platforms have both a search and a recommender system that,
while having heterogeneous input spaces, can be connected through their common
output item space and a shared semantic representation. In this paper, we
propose a new Zero-Shot Heterogeneous Transfer Learning framework that
transfers learned knowledge from the recommender system component to improve
the search component of a content platform. First, it learns representations of
items and their natural-language features by predicting (item, item)
correlation graphs derived from the recommender system as an auxiliary task.
Then, the learned representations are transferred to solve the target search
retrieval task, performing query-to-item prediction without having seen any
(query, item) pairs in training. We conduct online and offline experiments on
one of the world's largest search and recommender systems from Google, and
present the results and lessons learned. We demonstrate that the proposed
approach can achieve high performance on offline search retrieval tasks, and
more importantly, achieved significant improvements on relevance and user
interactions over the highly-optimized production system in online experiments.

This interpreter is again specialised to achieve the translation from big-step
to small-step style. The linear small-step program can be transformed back to a
big-step non-linear program using a third interpreter. A regular path
expression is computed for the linear program using Tarjan's algorithm, and
this regular expression then guides an interpreter to compute a program path.
The transformation is realised by specialisation of the path interpreter. In
all of the transformation phases, we use an established partial evaluator and
exploit standard logic program transformation to remove redundant data
structures and arguments in predicates and rename predicates to make clear
their link to statements in the original source program.

for deciding whether a program terminates dates back to Turing himself and

and then proving that the result of this function decreases for every possible
program transition. More recent approaches to proving termination have involved
moving away from the search for a single ranking function and toward a search
for a set of ranking functions; this set is a choice of ranking functions and a
disjunctive termination argument is used. In this paper, we describe a new
technique for determining whether programs terminate. Our technique is applied
to the output of the distillation program transformation that converts programs
into a simplified form called distilled form. Programs in distilled form are
converted into a corresponding labelled transition system and termination can
be demonstrated by showing that all possible infinite traces through this

integrated with reinforcement learning to develop a novel decentralized

the solution of the coupled mean field equations, the developed strategy can
obtain the optimal pursuit-evasion policy even for massive MAS under uncertain

five neural networks, which are 1) the critic neural network to approximate the
solution of the HJI equation for each individual agent; 2) the mass neural
network to estimate the population density function (i.e., mass) of the group;
3) the actor neural network to approximate the decentralized optimal strategy,

focus on a special family of quantum circuits called the Hamiltonian
Variational Ansatz (HVA), which takes inspiration from the quantum
approximation optimization algorithm and adiabatic quantum computation. Through
the study of its entanglement spectrum and energy gradient statistics, we find
that HVA exhibits favorable structural properties such as mild or entirely
absent barren plateaus and a restricted state space that eases their
optimization in comparison to the well-studied ""hardware-efficient ansatz."" We
also numerically observe that the optimization landscape of HVA becomes almost
trap free when the ansatz is over-parameterized. We observe a size-dependent
""computational phase transition"" as the number of layers in the HVA circuit is
increased where the optimization crosses over from a hard to an easy region in
terms of the quality of the approximations and speed of convergence to a good
solution. In contrast with the analogous transitions observed in the learning
of random unitaries which occur at a number of layers that grows exponentially
with the number of qubits, our Variational Quantum Eigensolver experiments
suggest that the threshold to achieve the over-parameterization phenomenon
scales at most polynomially in the number of qubits for the transverse field
Ising and XXZ models. Lastly, as a demonstration of its entangling power and
effectiveness, we show that HVA can find accurate approximations to the ground
states of a modified Haldane-Shastry Hamiltonian on a ring, which has
long-range interactions and has a power-law entanglement scaling.

a Jupiter Trojan asteroid, until dynamical studies and the appearance of

Centaur. However, the dynamical history, thermal environment, and impact of
such environments on the activity of 2019 LD2 are poorly understood. Here we
conduct dynamical simulations to constrain its orbital history and resulting
thermal environment over the past 3000 years. We find that 2019 LD2 is
currently in the vicinity of a dynamical ""Gateway"" that facilitates the
majority of transitions from the Centaur population into the Jupiter Family of
Comets (JFC population; Sarid et al. 2019). Our calculations show that it is
unlikely to have spent significant amounts of time in the inner solar system,
suggesting that its nucleus is relatively pristine in terms of physical,
chemical, and thermal processing through its history. This could explain its
relatively high level of distant activity as a recently activated primordial
body. Finally, we find that the median frequency of transition from the Gateway
population into the JFC population varies from once every ~3 years to less than
once every 70 years, if 2019 LD2's nucleus is ~1 km in radius or greater than 3
km in radius. Forward modeling of 2019 LD2 shows that it will transition into
the JFC population in 2063, representing the first known opportunity to observe
the evolution of an active Centaur nucleus as it experiences this

Bayesian kernel regressions and thus robust to overfitting. In this framework,
speaker information is fed to duration/acoustic models using speaker codes. We
also examine the use of deep Gaussian process latent variable models (DGPLVMs).
In this approach, the representation of each speaker is learned simultaneously
with other model parameters, and therefore the similarity or dissimilarity of
speakers is considered efficiently. We experimentally evaluated two situations
to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. In one situation, the
amount of data from each speaker is balanced (speaker-balanced), and in the
other, the data from certain speakers are limited (speaker-imbalanced).
Subjective and objective evaluation results showed that both the DGP and DGPLVM

regional proposals (RPs) per test image. These FSL models include a novel
parallel echo state network (ParESN) framework and an augmented U-net model.
Additionally, we propose a novel target label selection algorithm (TLSA) that
measures relative agreeability between RPs and the manually annotated target
labels to detect the ""best"" quality annotation per image. Using the FSL models,
our system achieves 0.28-0.64 Dice coefficient across vendor image stacks for
intra-retinal cyst segmentation. Additionally, the TLSA is capable of
automatically classifying high quality target labels from their noisy
counterparts for 60-97% of the images while ensuring manual supervision on
remaining images. Also, the proposed framework with ParESN model minimizes
manual annotation checking to 12-28% of the total number of images. The TLSA

role in modeling and analysis of complex dynamical systems, which allow linear

generation, multi-turn dialog generation is still a big challenge. So far,
there are two kinds of models for open-domain multi-turn dialog generation:
hierarchical and non-hierarchical models. Recently, some works have shown that
the hierarchical models are better than non-hierarchical models under their
experimental settings; meanwhile, some works also demonstrate the opposite
conclusion. Due to the lack of adequate comparisons, it's not clear which kind
of models are better in open-domain multi-turn dialog generation. Thus, in this
paper, we will measure systematically nearly all representative hierarchical
and non-hierarchical models over the same experimental settings to check which
kind is better. Through extensive experiments, we have the following three
important conclusions: (1) Nearly all hierarchical models are worse than
non-hierarchical models in open-domain multi-turn dialog generation, except for
the HRAN model. Through further analysis, the excellent performance of HRAN
mainly depends on its word-level attention mechanism; (2) The performance of
other hierarchical models will also obtain a great improvement if integrating
the word-level attention mechanism into these models. The modified hierarchical
models even significantly outperform the non-hierarchical models; (3) The
reason why the word-level attention mechanism is so powerful for hierarchical
models is because it can leverage context information more effectively,
especially the fine-grained information. Besides, we have implemented all of
the models and already released the codes.

ineffective at penalizing the intrinsic norms of weights for networks with
positively homogeneous activation functions, such as linear, ReLU and

networks are invariant to the shifting of weight scales between layers. The
ineffective regularizers are sensitive to such shifting and thus poorly
regularize the model capacity, leading to overfitting. To address this
shortcoming, we propose an improved regularizer that is invariant to weight
scale shifting and thus effectively constrains the intrinsic norm of a neural
network. The derived regularizer is an upper bound for the input gradient of
the network so minimizing the improved regularizer also benefits the
adversarial robustness. Residual connections are also considered and we show
that our regularizer also forms an upper bound to input gradients of such a

quality""---a brand new concept, to select a sub-group of video frames from the
original testing set to construct a new training set. The selected frames in
this new training set should all contain high-quality motions, in which the
salient objects will have large probability to be successfully detected by the

a significant performance improvement by using this new training set to start a

Our novel learning scheme is simple yet effective, and its semi-supervised

reduced by a factor of 2 or more to the current value (1 L_EM) after the Moon
forms. Capture into the evection resonance, occurring when the lunar perigee
precession period equals one year, could remove the angular momentum excess.
However the appropriate angular momentum removal appears sensitive to the tidal
model and chosen tidal parameters. In this work, we use a constant-time delay
tidal model to explore the Moon's orbital evolution through evection. We find
that exit from formal evection occurs early and that subsequently, the Moon
enters a quasi-resonance regime, in which evection still regulates the lunar
eccentricity even though the resonance angle is no longer librating. Although
not in resonance proper, during quasi-resonance angular momentum is
continuously removed from the Earth-Moon system and transferred to Earth's
heliocentric orbit. The final angular momentum, set by the timing of
quasi-resonance escape, is a function of the ratio of tidal strength in the
Moon and Earth and the absolute rate of tidal dissipation in the Earth. We
consider a physically-motivated model for tidal dissipation in the Earth as the
mantle cools from a molten to a partially molten state. We find that as the
mantle solidifies, increased terrestrial dissipation drives the Moon out of
quasi-resonance. For post-impact systems that contain >2 L_EM, final angular
momentum values after quasi-resonance escape remain significantly higher than
the current Earth-Moon value.

squeezed light. However, practical methods to achieve the quantum enhancement
in the stochastic phase estimation remains largely unexplored. Here we propose
a method utilizing the SU(1,1) interferometer and coherent input states to
estimate a stochastic optical phase. As an example, we investigate the
Ornstein-Uhlenback stochastic phase. We analyze the performance of this method
for three key estimation problems: prediction, tracking and smoothing. The
results show significant reduction of the mean square error compared with the
Mach-Zehnder interferometer under the same photon number flux inside the
interferometers. In particular, we show that the method with the SU(1,1)
interferometer can achieve the fundamental quantum scaling, the stochastic
Heisenberg scaling, and surpass the precision of the canonical measurement.

proposed to access parts of the bispectrum information with a more effective

enclosed in the power spectrum measurements. In this work, we generalize the
theory to apply the multitracer technique and explore its ability to constrain
the local type primordial non-Gaussianity. Using the spectra and their
covariance estimated from $N$-body simulations, we find the multitracer
approach is effective to reduce the cosmic variance noise. The $1\sigma$
marginalized errors for $b_1^2A_s, n_s$ and $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ are reduced
by 50\%, 52\% and 73\% comparing with the results using only power spectrum
obtained from a single tracer. It indicate that both the skew spectrum and the
multitracer technique are useful to constrain the primordial non-Gaussianity

module and the decoder module provide long-range information compensation and

distinction by integrating global context information from the input point
cloud to the convolution. To this end, a globally weighted local reference
frame is constructed in each point neighborhood in which the local point set is
decomposed into bins. Anchor points are generated in each bin to represent
global shape features. A convolution can then be performed to transform the

estimators as a function of AGN properties, we suggest to add correction term
$\Delta$M = -1.14 $\rm \log(FWHM_{MgII}/\sigma_{MgII}$) + 0.33 in the UV mass
estimator equation. We also find a $\sim$0.1 dex bias in the \mbh\ estimation
due to the difference of the spectral slope in the 2800-5200 \AA\ range.
Depending on the selection of \mbh\ estimator based on either line dispersion
or FWHM and either continuum or line luminosity, the derived UV mass estimators
show >~0.1 dex intrinsic scatter with respect to the fiducial \Hb\ based \mbh.

subject to gravitational interaction, and that the lepton excess in cosmic rays
may originate from DM particles, inspired us to investigate DM particle
properties beyond the standard model. We assume that a leptophilic SU(2)
doublet exists in nature as the mediator connecting DM with visible leptons.
Since general relativity is not renormalizable at the quantum level, it should
be regarded as an effective field theory's leading order term. One species of
the next-to-leading-order term should be operators linear to the Ricci scalar
and containing scalar fields, such as the Higgs field, scalar DM, or the newly
introduced SU(2) scalar doublet. These operators can cause DM annihilation
through gravity portals. We analyzed constraints from the cosmic antiproton
flux, DM relic abundance, cosmic positron flux, cosmic microwave background,
and direct detection experiments. The result shows that there is a vast
parameter space that is compatible with current experiments. DM with a mass of
electroweak scale is only allowed to annihilate into leptons. We further show
that the purely gravitational DM better explains the DArk Matter Particle

to applications in machine learning, statistics, and the sciences. However, in
most applications, the success of MOT is severely limited by a lack of
efficient algorithms. Indeed, MOT in general requires exponential time in the
number of marginals k and their support sizes n. This paper develops a general
theory about what ""structure"" makes MOT solvable in poly(n,k) time.
  We develop a unified algorithmic framework for solving MOT in poly(n,k) time
by characterizing the ""structure"" that different algorithms require in terms of
simple variants of the dual feasibility oracle. This framework has several
benefits. First, it enables us to show that the Sinkhorn algorithm, which is
currently the most popular MOT algorithm, requires strictly more structure than
other algorithms do to solve MOT in poly(n,k) time. Second, our framework makes
it much simpler to develop poly(n,k) time algorithms for a given MOT problem.
In particular, it is necessary and sufficient to (approximately) solve the dual
feasibility oracle -- which is much more amenable to standard algorithmic
techniques.
  We illustrate this ease-of-use by developing poly(n,k) time algorithms for
three general classes of MOT cost structures: (1) graphical structure; (2)
set-optimization structure; and (3) low-rank plus sparse structure. For
structure (1), we recover the known result that Sinkhorn has poly(n,k) runtime;
moreover, we provide the first poly(n,k) time algorithms for computing
solutions that are exact and sparse. For structures (2)-(3), we give the first
poly(n,k) time algorithms, even for approximate computation. Together, these
three structures encompass many -- if not most -- current applications of MOT.

these scenarios, epistemic reasoning, i.e., reasoning about agents' beliefs

winning strategies.
  This paper addresses the problem of reasoning in multi-agent epistemic

paper presents an actual implementation of a multi-shot Answer Set

called PLATO (ePistemic muLti-agent Answer seT programming sOlver). The ASP
paradigm enables a concise and elegant design of the planner, w.r.t. other

like their counterpart electrons in the electromagnetic field, allowing
analogous Aharonov-Bohm effect in photonics and paving the way for critical
applications like photonic isolation. Normally, a gauge potential exhibits
phase inversion along two opposite propagation paths. Here we experimentally
demonstrate phonon-induced anomalous gauge potentials with non-inverted gauge
phases in a spatial-frequency space, where quasi-phase-matched nonlinear
Brillouin scatterings enable such unique direction-dependent gauge phases.
Based on this scheme, we construct photonic isolators in the frequency domain
permitting nonreciprocal propagation of light along the frequency axis, where
coherent phase control in the photonic isolator allows switching completely the
directionality through an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. Moreover, similar
coherent controlled unidirectional frequency conversions are also illustrated.
These results may offer a unique platform for a compact, integrated solution to
implement synthetic-dimension devices for on-chip optical signal processing.

same shapes as type-I and type-II Dirac cones, respectively, in condensed
matter physics. Upon rotating the optical axis angle such that it is equal to
the cone angle, we find that this special TLCMM has the shape of a type-III
Dirac cone. This critical TLCMM can have many unique properties and is of a
fundamentally different nature than neighboring phases. When EM waves with
large wave vectors are incident to a metamaterial with an open IFC to free
space, the incident EM wave is strongly reflected due to wave-vector mismatch.
Here, we use boundary conditions and the causality law to reveal that TLCMM
high-k modes can achieve abnormal refraction without reflection and filtering.
Moreover, these phenomenon are observed experimentally in a planar
circuit-based system. The circuit-based TLCMM not only provides a versatile
platform for the study of robust negative refraction phenomena in
metamaterials, but also has a planar structure that is easier to integrate. Our
results regarding the manipulation of EM waves may enable their use in
planar-integrated photonics including for directional propagation, cloaking,

social networks, and online consumer systems such as Amazon, the quantity of
opinionated information available on the Internet has been increased. One of
the main tasks of the sentiment analysis is to detect polarity within a text.
The existing polarity detection methods mainly focus on keywords and their
naive frequency counts; however, they less regard the meanings and implicit
dimensions of the natural concepts. Although background knowledge plays a
critical role in determining the polarity of concepts, it has been disregarded
in polarity detection methods. This study presents a context-based model to
solve ambiguous polarity concepts using commonsense knowledge. First, a model
is presented to generate a source of ambiguous sentiment concepts based on
SenticNet by computing the probability distribution. Then the model uses a
bag-of-concepts approach to remove ambiguities and semantic augmentation with
the ConceptNet handling to overcome lost knowledge. ConceptNet is a large-scale
semantic network with a large number of commonsense concepts. In this paper,
the point mutual information (PMI) measure is used to select the contextual
concepts having strong relationships with ambiguous concepts. The polarity of
the ambiguous concepts is precisely detected using positive/negative contextual
concepts and the relationship of the concepts in the semantic knowledge base.
The text representation scheme is semantically enriched using Numberbatch,
which is a word embedding model based on the concepts from the ConceptNet
semantic network. The proposed model is evaluated by applying a corpus of
product reviews, called Semeval. The experimental results revealed an accuracy
rate of 82.07%, representing the effectiveness of the proposed model.

the system has strong stiffness, common ordinary differential equation solvers
have their limitations. To overcome these issues, a Rosenbrock-type exponential

Of
special interest are the ultramassive white dwarfs, as they are related to type

white dwarfs are expected to harbour oxygen-neon (ONe) cores as a result of
single standard stellar evolution. However, a fraction of them could have
carbon-oxygen (CO) cores. Recent studies, based on the new observations

cannot be attributed only to the occurrence of crystallization, thus requiring

clustering with unlabelled data. By introducing data augmentation, most of the
latest methods look into deep clustering from the perspective that the original
image and its transformation should share similar semantic clustering
assignment. However, the representation features could be quite different even
they are assigned to the same cluster since softmax function is only sensitive
to the maximum value. This may result in high intra-class diversities in the
representation feature space, which will lead to unstable local optimal and
thus harm the clustering performance. To address this drawback, we proposed
Deep Robust Clustering (DRC). Different from existing methods, DRC looks into
deep clustering from two perspectives of both semantic clustering assignment
and representation feature, which can increase inter-class diversities and
decrease intra-class diversities simultaneously. Furthermore, we summarized a
general framework that can turn any maximizing mutual information into
minimizing contrastive loss by investigating the internal relationship between
mutual information and contrastive learning. And we successfully applied it in
DRC to learn invariant features and robust clusters. Extensive experiments on
six widely-adopted deep clustering benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of
DRC in both stability and accuracy. e.g., attaining 71.6% mean accuracy on
CIFAR-10, which is 7.1% higher than state-of-the-art results.

documents, e.g., blogs or Q&A, instead of code itself. The major reason is due

learning models have been proposed to address this challenge. Compared with
approaches using information retrieval techniques, deep learning models do not
suffer from the information loss caused by refining user intention into
keywords. However, the performance of previous works is not satisfactory
because they ignore the importance of code structure. When the semantics of
code (e.g., identifier names, APIs) are ambiguous, code structure may be the
only feature for the model to utilize. In that case, previous works relearn the
structural information from lexical tokens of code, which is extremely

speleothems from the Herbstlabyrinth cave system do not show distinct peaks in
the other proxies. This may suggest that the speleothem {\delta}18O values
recorded in the three stalagmites do not primarily reflect climate change at
the cave site, but rather large-scale changes in the North Atlantic. This is
supported by comparison with climate modelling data, which suggest that the
negative peak in the speleothem {\delta}18O values is mainly due to lower
{\delta}18O values of precipitation above the cave and that temperature only
played a minor role. Alternatively, the other proxies may not be as sensitive
as {\delta}18O values to record this centennial-scale cooling event. This may
particularly be the case for speleothem {\delta}13C values as suggested by
comparison with a climate modelling study simulating vegetation changes in
Europe during the 8.2 ka event. ...

major challenge in neural architecture search (NAS). To reduce the architecture
training costs in NAS, one-shot estimators (OSEs) amortize the architecture
training costs by sharing the parameters of one ""supernet"" between all
architectures. Recently, zero-shot estimators (ZSEs) that involve no training
are proposed to further reduce the architecture evaluation cost. Despite the
high efficiency of these estimators, the quality of such estimations has not
been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we conduct an extensive and organized
assessment of OSEs and ZSEs on five NAS benchmarks: NAS-Bench-101/201/301, and
NDS ResNet/ResNeXt-A. Specifically, we employ a set of NAS-oriented criteria to
study the behavior of OSEs and ZSEs and reveal that they have certain biases
and variances. After analyzing how and why the OSE estimations are
unsatisfying, we explore how to mitigate the correlation gap of OSEs from
several perspectives. Through our analysis, we give out suggestions for future
application and development of efficient architecture performance estimators.
Furthermore, the analysis framework proposed in our work could be utilized in

differ only slightly from their benign counterparts yet provoke
misclassifications of the attacked NNs. The required perturbations to craft the

learning-based systems from such attacks, several countermeasures have been
proposed with adversarial training still being considered the most effective.
Here, NNs are iteratively retrained using adversarial examples forming a
computational expensive and time consuming process often leading to a
performance decrease. To overcome the downsides of adversarial training while
still providing a high level of security, we present a new training approach we
call \textit{entropic retraining}. Based on an information-theoretic-inspired
analysis, entropic retraining mimics the effects of adversarial training
without the need of the laborious generation of adversarial examples. We
empirically show that entropic retraining leads to a significant increase in
NNs' security and robustness while only relying on the given original data.

resolve issues such as selecting the required threshold and quantifying the

reordering. Re-sequencing buffers are then used to provide in-order delivery,
the parameters of which (timeout, buffer size) may affect worst-case delay and
delay jitter. There is so far no precise understanding of per-flow reordering
metrics nor of the dimensioning of re-sequencing buffers in order to provide
worst-case guarantees, as required in such networks. First, we show that a
previously proposed per-flow metric, reordering late time offset (RTO),
determines the timeout value. If the network is lossless, another previously
defined metric, the reordering byte offset (RBO), determines the required
buffer. If packet losses cannot be ignored, the required buffer may be larger
than RBO, and depends on jitter, an arrival curve of the flow at its source,
and the timeout. Then we develop a calculus to compute the RTO for a flow path;
the method uses a novel relation with jitter and arrival curve, together with a
decomposition of the path into non order-preserving and order-preserving
elements. We also analyse the effect of re-sequencing buffers on worst-case
delay, jitter and propagation of arrival curves. We show in particular that, in
a lossless (but non order-preserving) network, re-sequencing is ""for free"",
namely, it does not increase worst-case delay nor jitter, whereas in a lossy
network, re-sequencing increases the worst-case delay and jitter. We apply the
analysis to evaluate the performance impact of placing re-sequencing buffers at
intermediate points and illustrate the results on two industrial test cases.

increasingly expensive as the continuum limit is approached since the cost per
independent sample grows with a high power of the inverse lattice spacing.
Simulations on fine lattices suffer from critical slowdown, the rapid growth of
autocorrelations in the Markov chain. This causes a strong increase in the
number of lattice configurations that have to be generated to obtain
statistically significant results. This paper discusses hierarchical sampling
methods to tame the growth in autocorrelations. Combined with multilevel
variance reduction, this significantly reduces the computational cost of
simulations for given tolerances $\epsilon_{\text{disc}}$ on the discretisation
error and $\epsilon_{\text{stat}}$ on the statistical error. For observables
with lattice errors of order $\alpha$ and integrated autocorrelation times that
grow like $\tau_{\mathrm{int}}\propto a^{-z}$, multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC)
reduces the cost from
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\text{stat}}^{-2}\epsilon_{\text{disc}}^{-(1+z)/\alpha})$
to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\text{stat}}^{-2}\vert\log \epsilon_{\text{disc}}
\vert^2+\epsilon_{\text{disc}}^{-1/\alpha})$ or
$\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\text{stat}}^{-2}+\epsilon_{\text{disc}}^{-1/\alpha})$.
Higher gains are expected for simulations of quantum field theories in $D$
dimensions. The efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on two model
systems, including a topological oscillator that is badly affected by critical
slowdown from topological charge freezing. On fine lattices, the new methods
are orders of magnitude faster than standard Hybrid Monte Carlo sampling. For
high resolutions, MLMC can be used to accelerate even the cluster algorithm for
the topological oscillator. Performance is further improved through
perturbative matching which guarantees efficient coupling of theories on the
multilevel hierarchy.

the maximum edge-density of any minor of $G$. Our proof is simple, elementary,
and constructive - featuring a $\tilde{\Theta}(\delta D)$-round distributed
construction algorithm. Our results are tight up to $\tilde{O}(1)$ factors and
generalize, simplify, unify, and strengthen several prior results. For example,
for graphs excluding a fixed minor, i.e., graphs with constant $\delta$, only a
$\tilde{O}(D^2)$ bound was known based on a very technical proof that relies on
the Robertson-Seymour Graph Structure Theorem.
  A direct consequence of our result is that many graph families, including any
minor-excluded ones, have near-optimal $\tilde{\Theta}(D)$-round distributed
algorithms for many fundamental communication primitives and optimization
problems including minimum spanning tree, minimum cut, and shortest-path
approximations.

shown to be NP-hard and approximation algorithms with provable quality

computationally expensive even for medium-scaled graphs. Furthermore, graph

critical for almost all memory-bound graph kernels. We apply the proposed

dimensional (3D) setting and taken into account the UAV-BS capacity limit and
the quality of service (QoS) requirements of ground users. Therefore, in this
paper, we focus on the problem of deploying UAV-BSs to provide satisfactory
wireless communication services, with the aim to maximize the total number of
covered user equipment (UE) subject to user data rate requirements and UAV-BSs'
capacity limit. First, we model the relationship between the air-to-ground

vertical dimensions which has not been considered in previous works. Unlike the
conventional UAV deployment problem formulation, the 3D deployment problem is
decoupled into a 2D horizontal placement and altitude determination connected

maximum coverage of the users with consideration of data rate distribution.
Finally, numerical and simulation results show that the proposed approach has

observed at exceptional points, an especially intriguing property, with
relevant practical potential, consists in the inherently enhanced sensitivity
to small-scale perturbations. So far, however, these principles have been
implemented at the expenses of precise fabrication and tuning requirements,
involving tailored nano-structured devices with controlled distributions of
optical gain and loss. In this work, anti-parity-time symmetric phase
transitions and exceptional point singularities are demonstrated in a single
strand of standard single-mode telecommunication fibre, using a setup
consisting of entirely of off-the-shelf components. Two propagating signals are
amplified and coupled through stimulated Brillouin scattering, which makes the
process non-Hermitian and enables exquisite control over gain and loss.
Singular response to small variations around the exceptional point and
topological features arising around this singularity are experimentally
demonstrated with large precision, enabling robustly enhanced spectral response
to small-scale changes in the Brillouin frequency shift. Our findings open
exciting opportunities for the exploration of non-Hermitian phenomena over a
table-top setup, with straightforward extensions to higher-order Hamiltonians
and applications in quantum optics, nanophotonics and sensing.

of the speakers by requesting personalized utterances to be spoken in contrast
to the standard text-dependent or text-independent schemes. To do so, we cast
the speaker recognition task into a sequential decision-making problem that we
solve with Reinforcement Learning. Using a standard dataset, we show that our

novel classes are from the same domain (in-domain setting). However, in
practice, it may be infeasible to collect sufficient training samples for some
special domains to construct base classes. To solve this problem, cross-domain
FSL (CDFSL) is proposed very recently to transfer knowledge from general-domain
base classes to special-domain novel classes. Existing CDFSL works mostly focus
on transferring between near domains, while rarely consider transferring
between distant domains, which is in practical need as any novel classes could
appear in real-world applications, and is even more challenging. In this paper,
we study a challenging subset of CDFSL where the novel classes are in distant
domains from base classes, by revisiting the mid-level features, which are more
transferable yet under-explored in main stream FSL work. To boost the
discriminability of mid-level features, we propose a residual-prediction task
to encourage mid-level features to learn discriminative information of each
sample. Notably, such mechanism also benefits the in-domain FSL and CDFSL in
near domains. Therefore, we provide two types of features for both cross- and
in-domain FSL respectively, under the same training framework. Experiments
under both settings on six public datasets, including two challenging medical
datasets, validate the our rationale and demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance. Code will be released.

published researchers to and from Russia. Using an exhaustive set of over $2.4$
million Scopus publications, we analyze all researchers who have published with
a Russian affiliation address in Scopus-indexed sources in 1996-2020. The
migration of researchers is observed through the changes in their affiliation
addresses, which altered their mode countries of affiliation across different
years. While only $5.2\%$ of these researchers were internationally mobile,
they accounted for a substantial proportion of citations. Our estimates of net
migration rates indicate that while Russia was a donor country in the late
1990s and early 2000s, it has experienced a relatively balanced circulation of
researchers in more recent years. These findings suggest that the current
trends in scholarly migration in Russia could be better framed as brain
circulation, rather than as brain drain. Overall, researchers emigrating from
Russia outnumbered and outperformed researchers immigrating to Russia. Our
analysis on the subject categories of publication venues shows that in the past
25 years, Russia has, overall, suffered a net loss in most disciplines, and
most notably in the five disciplines of neuroscience, decision sciences,
mathematics, biochemistry, and pharmacology. We demonstrate the robustness of
our main findings under random exclusion of data and changes in numeric
parameters. Our substantive results shed light on new aspects of international
mobility in academia, and on the impact of this mobility on a national science
system, which have direct implications for policy development.
Methodologically, our novel approach to handling big data can be adopted as a

mathematically describe the behaviour of uncertain processes in terms of
supermartingales; capital processes corresponding to available betting
strategies. Compared to (the more common) measure-theoretic expectation
functionals, they are not bounded to restrictive assumptions such as
measurability or precision, yet succeed in preserving, or even generalising
many of their fundamental properties. We focus on a discrete-time setting where
local state spaces are finite and, in this specific context, build on the
existing work of Shafer and Vovk; the main developers of the framework of
game-theoretic upper expectations. In a first part, we study Shafer and Vovk's
characterisation of a local upper expectation and show how it is related to
Walley's behavioural notion of coherence. The second part consists in a study
of game-theoretic upper expectations on a more global level, where several
alternative definitions, as well as a broad range of properties are derived,
e.g. the law of iterated upper expectations, compatibility with local models,
coherence properties,... Our main contribution, however, concerns the
continuity behaviour of these operators. We prove continuity with respect to
non-increasing sequences of so-called lower cuts and continuity with respect to
non-increasing sequences of finitary functions. We moreover show that the
game-theoretic upper expectation is uniquely determined by its values on the
domain of bounded below limits of finitary functions, and additionally show
that, for any such limit, the limiting sequence can be constructed in such a
way that the game-theoretic upper expectation is continuous with respect to
this particular sequence.

  Damage Index",,,,,"eess.SY cs.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Aircraft structures experience various kinds of loads over their entire
lifetime, typically leading to fatigue and ultimately structural failure. In
order to avoid structural failure during operation, the maximum number of
flight cycles and flight hours is regulated by laws ensuring continued
airworthiness. However, since every flight impacts the aircraft differently,
not all airframes are equally stressed at the time of decommissioning. This
paper proposes a new retirement criterion based on the so-called fatigue damage
index (FDI). The criterion takes into account that aircraft are differently
operated and thus enables an individual decommissioning of aircraft without
compromising its safety. Based on aircraft sample data covering 95% of the
Airbus A320 fleet over two years, the enhanced decommissioning criterion is
estimated to significantly extend the average aircraft service life. The impact
varies within the fleet, depending on the experienced seat load factors, cruise
altitudes, and taxi times considered for the individual aircraft during
operation. While seat load factors and flight altitudes significantly affect
the defined FDI, the influence of taxi times is only minor. Based on the
estimated increase in aircraft service life, the paper argues that for service
life extensions, the FDI shall be considered as the limit of validity in the
regulatory framework governing the decommissioning of aircraft.

experiment that will operate at SNOLAB (Canada). Similar to other rare-event
searches, the materials used in the detector construction are subject to
stringent radiopurity requirements. The detector features a 140-cm diameter
proportional counter comprising two hemispheres made from commercially sourced
99.99% pure copper. Such copper is widely used in rare-event searches because
it is readily available, there are no long-lived Cu radioisotopes, and levels
of non-Cu radiocontaminants are generally low. However, measurements performed
with a dedicated 210Po alpha counting method using an XIA detector confirmed a
problematic concentration of 210Pb in bulk of the copper. To shield the
proportional counter's active volume, a low-background electroforming method
was adapted to the hemispherical shape to grow a 500-$\mu$m thick layer of
ultra-radiopure copper to the detector's inner surface. In this paper the
process is described, which was prototyped at Pacific Northwest National
Laboratory (PNNL), USA, and then conducted at full scale in the Laboratoire
Souterrain de Modane in France. The radiopurity of the electroplated copper was
assessed through Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS).
Measurements of samples from the first (second) hemisphere give 68% confidence
upper limits of <0.58 $\mu$Bq/kg (<0.24 $\mu$Bq/kg) and <0.26 $\mu$Bq/kg (<0.11
$\mu$Bq/kg) on the 232Th and 238U contamination levels, respectively. These
results are comparable to previously reported measurements of electroformed

missing from the puzzle when modeling the spectra of supernovae (SNe).
Molecules have both a direct impact on the spectra, particularly in the
infrared, and an indirect one as a result of their influence on certain
physical conditions, such as temperature. In this paper, we aim to investigate
molecular formation and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) cooling,
with a particular focus on CO, the most commonly detected molecule in
supernovae. We also aim to determine the dependency of supernova chemistry on
physical parameters and the relative sensitivity to rate uncertainties. We
implemented a chemical kinetic description of the destruction and formation of
molecules into the SN spectral synthesis code SUMO. In addition, selected
molecules were coupled into the full NLTE level population framework and, thus,
we incorporated molecular NLTE cooling into the temperature equation. We
produced a test model of the CO formation in SN 1987A between 150 and 600 days
and investigated the sensitivity of the resulting molecular masses to the input
parameters. We find that there is a close inter-dependency between the thermal
evolution and the amount of CO formed, mainly through an important

CO completely dominates the cooling of the oxygen-carbon zone of the supernova

calculated CO mass scales approximately linearly with the typical uncertainty
factor for individual rates. We demonstrate how molecular masses can
potentially be used to constrain various physical parameters of the supernova.

We used the dark matter-only MultiDark suite of simulations and the high-mass
objects M > 2.7e13 M/h therein. We measured mean relations of concentration,
offset, and spin as a function of halo mass and redshift. We investigated the
distributions around the mean relations. We measured the halo mass function as
a function of offset, spin, and redshift. We formulated a generalized mass
function framework that accounts for the dynamical state of the dark matter
haloes. We confirm the discovery of the concentration upturn at high masses and
provide a model that predicts the concentration for different values of mass
and redshift with one single equation. We model the distributions around the
mean concentration, offset, and spin with modified Schechter functions. The
concentration of low-mass haloes shows a faster redshift evolution compared to
high-mass haloes, especially in the high-concentration regime. The offset
parameter is smaller at low redshift, in agreement with the relaxation of
structures at recent times. The peak of its distribution shifts by a factor of
1.5 from z = 1.4 to z = 0. The individual models are combined into a
comprehensive mass function model, as a function of spin and offset. Our model
recovers the fiducial mass function with 3% accuracy at redshift 0 and accounts
for redshift evolution up to z = 1.5. This approach accounts for the dynamical
state of the halo when measuring the halo mass function. It offers a connection
with dynamical selection effects in galaxy cluster observations. This is key
toward precision cosmology using cluster counts as a probe.

external eavesdropper can successfully wiretap the reference signals of all

privacy against the eavesdropper, a state decomposition scheme is developed
where the original state of each agent is decomposed into two sub-states: one
succeeds the role of the original state in inter-node interactions, while the
other sub-state only communicates with the first one and is invisible to other
neighboring agents. Rigorous analyses are performed to show that 1) the
proposed privacy scheme preserves the convergence of the average consensus; and
2) the privacy of the agents is protected such that an eavesdropper cannot
discover the private reference signals with any guaranteed accuracy. The
developed privacy-preserving dynamic average consensus framework is then
applied to the formation control of multiple non-holonomic mobile robots, in
which the efficacy of the scheme is demonstrated. Numerical simulation is

gelation of weakly attractive colloidal particles by means of experiments on
critical Casimir attractive colloidal systems, simulations and analytical
theory. In the experiments and simulations, we follow the mean coordination
number of the particles during the growth of clusters to identify an
attractive-strength independent cluster evolution as a function of mean
coordination number. We relate this cluster evolution to the kinetic attachment
and detachment rates of particles and particle clusters. We find that
single-particle detachment dominates in the relevant weak attractive-strength
regime, while association rates are almost independent of the cluster size.
Using the limit of single-particle dissociation and size-independent
association rates, we solve the master kinetic equation of cluster growth
analytically to predict power-law cluster mass distributions with exponents
$-3/2$ and $-5/2$ before and after gelation, respectively, which are consistent
with the experimental and simulation data. These results suggest that the
observed critical Casimir-induced gelation is a second-order nonequilibrium
phase transition (with broken detailed balance). Consistent with this scenario,
the size of the largest cluster is observed to diverge with power-law exponent
according to three-dimensional percolation upon approaching the critical mean
coordination number.

this paper, we focus on addressing the missing data imputation problem for

Smoothing Tensor Completion (LSTC-Tubal) -- based on the existing framework of
Low-Rank Tensor Completion, which is well-suited for spatiotemporal traffic
data that is characterized by multidimensional structure of location$\times$
time of day $\times$ day. In particular, the proposed LSTC-Tubal model involves
a scalable tensor nuclear norm minimization scheme by integrating linear
unitary transformation. Therefore, tensor nuclear norm minimization can be
solved by singular value thresholding on the transformed matrix of each day
while the day-to-day correlation can be effectively preserved by the unitary
transform matrix. We compare LSTC-Tubal with state-of-the-art baseline models,
and find that LSTC-Tubal can achieve competitive accuracy with a significantly
lower computational cost. In addition, the LSTC-Tubal will also benefit other
tasks in modeling large-scale spatiotemporal traffic data, such as

estimate in parameter space does not account for uncertainty. Here, we frame
learning as filtering, i.e., a principled method for including time and

biological relevance. For the computational relevance, we show that filtering
in combination with Bayesian regression improves performance compared to a

However, when interpreting the electrical response of biological membranes to
voltage changes, they are commonly considered as inert insulators. However,
lipid bilayers under voltage-clamp conditions do not only display current
traces with discrete conduction-steps indistinguishable from those attributed
to the presence of protein channels. In current-voltage (I-V) plots they may
also display outward rectification, i.e., voltage-gating. Surprisingly, this
has even been observed in chemically symmetric lipid bilayers. Here, we
investigate this phenomenon using a theoretical framework that models the
electrostrictive effect of voltage on lipid membranes in the presence of a
spontaneous polarization, which can be recognized by a voltage offset in
electrical measurements. It can arise from an asymmetry of the membrane, for
example from a nonzero spontaneous curvature of the membrane. This curvature
can be caused by voltage via the flexoelectric effect, or by hydrostatic
pressure differences across the membrane. Here, we describe I-V relations for
lipid membranes formed at the tip of patch pipettes situated close to an
aqueous surface. We measured at different depths relative to air/water surface,
resulting in different pressure gradients across the membrane. Both linear and
nonlinear I-V profiles were observed. Nonlinear conduction consistently takes
the form of outward rectified currents. We explain the conductance properties
by two mechanisms: One leak current with constant conductance without pores,
and a second process that is due to voltage-gated pore opening correlating with
the appearance of channel-like conduction steps. In some instances, these
nonlinear I-V relations display a voltage regime in which dI/dV is negative.
This has also been previously observed in the presence of sodium channels. ...

prerequisite for treatment approaches in patients with primary prostate cancer

underlies interobserver heterogeneity and is time consuming. The aim of this
study was to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automated
segmentation of intraprostatic tumour (GTV-CNN) in PSMA-PET.
  Methods: The CNN (3D U-Net) was trained on [68Ga]PSMA-PET images of 152
patients from two different institutions and the training labels were generated
manually using a validated technique. The CNN was tested on two independent
internal (cohort 1: [68Ga]PSMA-PET, n=18 and cohort 2: [18F]PSMA-PET, n=19) and
one external (cohort 3: [68Ga]PSMA-PET, n=20) test-datasets. Accordance between
manual contours and GTV-CNN was assessed with Dice-S{\o}rensen coefficient
(DSC). Sensitivity and specificity were calculated for the two internal
test-datasets by using whole-mount histology.
  Results: Median DSCs for cohorts 1-3 were 0.84 (range: 0.32-0.95), 0.81
(range: 0.28-0.93) and 0.83 (range: 0.32-0.93), respectively. Sensitivities and
specificities for GTV-CNN were comparable with manual expert contours: 0.98 and
0.76 (cohort 1) and 1 and 0.57 (cohort 2), respectively. Computation time was
around 6 seconds for a standard dataset.
  Conclusion: The application of a CNN for automated contouring of
intraprostatic GTV in [68Ga]PSMA- and [18F]PSMA-PET images resulted in a high
concordance with expert contours and in high sensitivities and specificities in
comparison with histology reference. This robust, accurate and fast technique
may be implemented for treatment concepts in primary PCa. The trained model and

problem, we conducted semi-structured interviews with middle-aged YouTube video
consumers to analyze their user beliefs about the video recommendation system.
Our analysis revealed different factors that users believe influence their
recommendations. Based on these factors, we identified four groups of user
beliefs: Previous Actions, Social Media, Recommender System, and Company
Policy. Additionally, we propose a framework to distinguish the four main
actors that users believe influence their video recommendations: the current
user, other users, the algorithm, and the organization. This framework provides
a new lens to explore design suggestions based on the agency of these four

corporate decisions on the interaction with algorithmic recommendations. While
we found that users are aware of the existence of the recommendation system on

SDO/HMI active region patch data between 2010 and 2020. An automated code is
developed for fitting each active region patch with a BMR, matching both the
magnetic flux and axial dipole moment of the region and removing repeat

the net axial dipole moment, given the same flow parameters. This is caused by
neglecting the more complex multipolar and/or asymmetric magnetic structures of
many of the real active regions, and may explain why previous flux transport
models had to reduce BMR tilt angles to obtain realistic polar fields. Our BMR

collisions in the CERN Large Hadron Collider for high-energy experiments. The
LHC multi-stage collimation system is designed to provide protection against
regular and abnormal losses in order to reduce the risk of quenches of the
superconducting magnets as well as keeping background in the experiments under
control. Compared to protons, beam collimation in the heavy-ion runs is more
challenging despite the lower stored beam energies, because the efficiency of
cleaning with heavy ions has been observed to be two orders of magnitude worse.
This is due to the differences in the interaction mechanisms between the beams
and the collimators. Ion beams experience fragmentation and electromagnetic
dissociation at the collimators that result in a substantial flux of
off-rigidity particles that escape the collimation system. These out-scattered
nuclei might be lost around the ring, eventually imposing a limit on the
maximum achievable stored beam energy. Accurate simulation tools are crucial in
order to understand and control these losses. A new simulation framework has
been developed for heavy-ion collimation based on the coupling of the Sixtrack
tracking code and the FLUKA Monte Carlo code that models the electromagnetic
and nuclear interactions of the heavy-ions with the nuclei of the collimator
material. In this paper, the new simulation tool is described. Furthermore,
Sixtrack-FLUKA coupling simulations are presented and compared with
measurements done with Pb ions in the LHC. The agreement between simulations
and measurements is discussed and the results are used to understand and
optimise losses. The simulation tool is also applied to predict the performance
of the collimation system for the High-Luminosity LHC.

pair-natural orbitals (DLPNO) framework. The use of spin-independent set of

corollary process theory, active inference, to develop a generic, generalizable
model of the representational capacities of living creatures; that is, a theory
of phenotypic representation. Given their ubiquity, we are concerned with
distributed forms of representation (e.g., population codes), whereby patterns
of ensemble activity in living tissue come to represent the causes of sensory
input or data. The active inference framework rests on the Markov blanket
formalism, which allows us to partition systems of interest, such as biological
systems, into internal states, external states, and the blanket (active and
sensory) states that render internal and external states conditionally
independent of each other. In this framework, the representational capacity of
living creatures emerges as a consequence of their Markovian structure and
nonequilibrium dynamics, which together entail a dual-aspect information
geometry. This entails a modest representational capacity: internal states have
an intrinsic information geometry that describes their trajectory over time in
state space, as well as an extrinsic information geometry that allows internal
states to encode (the parameters of) probabilistic beliefs about (fictive)
external states. Building on this, we describe here how, in an automatic and
emergent manner, information about stimuli can come to be encoded by groups of
neurons bound by a Markov blanket; what is known as the neuronal packet
hypothesis. As a concrete demonstration of this type of emergent
representation, we present numerical simulations showing that self-organizing
ensembles of active inference agents sharing the right kind of probabilistic
generative model are able to encode recoverable information about a stimulus
array.

represent formidable challenges as subjects of research due to the high
complexity of the light propagation within them; however, dramatic advances in
this nascent field have been furnished by the paradigm of applying wavefront
shaping techniques to the beam pumping the system. We present here a
theoretical and experimental study employing this approach in a gain medium
where the disorder arises not from random scattering but rather from the
multimodality of a waveguide: an amplifying multimode fiber. The shaping of the
core-guided pump prior to its injection affects the complex, speckle-like
patterns of excitation within the fiber volume. Thus we are offered the
intriguing prospect of manipulating the spatially heterogeneous gain in a
system where the disorder, albeit highly complex, may be fully understood in
terms of the discrete eigenmodes of a well-known waveguide. We study our medium
in two different configurations: as an optical amplifier, and as a fiber laser.
In the first configuration we show that dependence upon the pump configuration,
of the amplifier transmission function, surprisingly survives several physical
mechanisms which at first sight would appear to severely limit it. This insight
is then carried on to the lasing cavity configuration, where we find striking
parallels between the behavior of the system and that of random lasers; more
importantly, the pump shaping shows a strong ability to control the complex
emission, in particular - to selectively favor individual spectral lines and
stabilize single-mode operation.

Namely, at least for a sufficiently steep barrier, the physical solutions of
the equation are not determined by the ""mechanical state"" of position and

recent experiments, both in course and planned, on the interactions between
strong laser pulses and ultra relativistic electrons, it becomes interesting to
establish whether such a nonuniqueness phenomenon extends to the latter case,
and for which ranges of the parameters. In the present work we will consider
just the simplest model, i.e., the case of an electromagnetic plane wave, and
moreover for the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation dealt with in the

optimization and control of multiphysical systems. Yet, its relationship to
thermodynamics seems to be unclear. The Hamiltonian is traditionally thought of
as energy, although its meaning is exergy. This insight yields benefits: 1.
Links to the GENERIC structure are identified, making it relatively easy to
borrow ideas from a popular framework for nonequilibrium thermodynamics. 2. The
port-Hamiltonian structure combined with a suitable bond-graph syntax is
expected to become a main ingredient in thermodynamic optimization methods akin
to exergy analysis and beyond. The intuitive nature of exergy and diagrammatic
language facilitates interdisciplinary communication that is necessary for
implementing sustainable energy systems and processes. Port-Hamiltonian systems
are cyclo-passive, meaning that a power-balance equation immediately follows
from their definition. For exergetic port-Hamiltonian systems, cyclo-passivity
is synonymous with degradation of energy and follows from the first and the
second law of thermodynamics being encoded as structural properties.

financial and business transactions. However, many identified bugs and
vulnerabilities in smart contracts have led to serious financial losses, which
raises serious concerns about smart contract security. Thus, there is a
significant need to better maintain smart contract code and ensure its high
reliability. In this research: (1) Firstly, we propose an automated deep
learning based approach to learn structural code embeddings of smart contracts
in Solidity, which is useful for clone detection, bug detection and contract
validation on smart contracts. We apply our approach to more than 22K solidity
contracts collected from the Ethereum blockchain, results show that the clone
ratio of solidity code is at around 90%, much higher than traditional software.
We collect a list of 52 known buggy smart contracts belonging to 10 kinds of
common vulnerabilities as our bug database. Our approach can identify more than
1000 clone related bugs based on our bug databases efficiently and accurately.
(2) Secondly, according to developers' feedback, we have implemented the
approach in a web-based tool, named SmartEmbed, to facilitate Solidity
developers for using our approach. Our tool can assist Solidity developers to
efficiently identify repetitive smart contracts in the existing Ethereum
blockchain, as well as checking their contract against a known set of bugs,
which can help to improve the users' confidence in the reliability of the
contract. We optimize the implementations of SmartEmbed which is sufficient in
supporting developers in real-time for practical uses. The Ethereum ecosystem
as well as the individual Solidity developer can both benefit from our
research.

Lagrange-d'Alembert principle. Three different possibilities are considered for
the multi-rate relation between angular velocity measurements and direction
vector measurements for attitude: 1) integer relation between sampling rates,
2) time-varying sampling rates, 3) non-integer relation between sampling rates.
In all cases, it is assumed that angular velocity measurements are sampled at a
higher rate compared to the inertial vectors. The attitude determination
problem from two or more vector measurements in the body-fixed frame is
formulated as Wahba's problem. At instants when direction vector measurements
are absent, a discrete-time model for attitude kinematics is used to propagate
past measurements. A discrete-time Lagrangian is constructed as the difference
between a kinetic energy-like term that is quadratic in the angular velocity
estimation error and an artificial potential energy-like term obtained from
Wahba's cost function. An additional dissipation term is introduced and the
discrete-time Lagrange-d'Alembert principle is applied to the Lagrangian with
this dissipation to obtain an optimal filtering scheme. A discrete-time
Lyapunov analysis is carried out to show that the optimal filtering scheme is
asymptotically stable in the absence of measurement noise and the domain of
convergence is almost global. For a realistic evaluation of the scheme,
numerical experiments are conducted with inputs corrupted by bounded
measurement noise. These numerical simulations exhibit convergence of the
estimated states to a bounded neighborhood of the actual states.

three-dimensional interactive autonomous system by choosing suitable
interaction between dark energy and dark matter. We take the interaction kernel
as $Q = 3\beta^{2\gamma} H\rho_d$. In order to explain the stability of this

obtained critical points to show the different phases of universe and
cosmological implications. Surprisingly, we find some stable critical points
which represent late time dark energy dominated era when a model parameter
$\alpha=-5.05$. In order to explain both the energy dominated era as well as
the late-time acceleration of the universe at same time, we introduce a
two-dimensional interactive autonomous system. After graphical analysis of

them solely. However, such fully automatic fusions may not always be helpful
for the SOD task because the D quality itself usually varies from scene to

been overlooked by previous work. As a result, it is becoming a clear
performance bottleneck. Thus, we propose a simple yet effective scheme to

following a multi-scale methodology that includes low-level edge consistency,
mid-level regional uncertainty and high-level model variance. All these

observation properties, which is caused by the beaming effect, expressed by a
Doppler factor, in a relativistic jet. Doppler factor is an important parameter
in the blazars paradigm to indicate all of the observation properties, and many
methods were proposed to estimate its value. In this paper, we present a method
following Mattox et al. to calculate the lower limit on gamma-ray Doppler
factor for 809 selected Fermi/LAT-detected gamma-ray blazars by adopting the
available gamma-ray and X-ray data. Our sample included 342 flat-spectrum radio
quasars (FSRQs) and 467 BL Lac objects (BL Lacs), out of which 507 sources are
compiled with available radio core-dominance parameter (R) from our previous
study. Our calculation shows that the average values of the lower limit on
gamma-ray Doppler factor for FSRQs and BL Lacs are 6.87 and 4.31, respectively.
We compare and discuss our results with those from the literature. We found
that the derived lower limit on gamma-ray Doppler factor for some sources are
higher than that from the radio estimation, which could be possibly explained
by the jet bending within those blazars. Our results also suggest that the
gamma-ray and radio regions perhaps share the same relativistic effects. The
gamma-ray Doppler factor has been found to be correlated with both the
gamma-ray luminosity and core-dominance parameter, implying that the jet is
possibly continuous in the gamma-ray bands, and R is perhaps an indicator for a
beaming effect.

as one of the tools of choice for such measurement schemes. Using sinusoidal
phase modulation homodyne interferometry allows a drastic reduction of the
complexity of the optical setup, a key limitation of multi-channel
interferometry. By shifting the complexity of the setup to the signal
processing stage, these methods enable devices with a size and weight not
feasible using conventional techniques. In this paper we present the design of
a novel sensor topology based on deep frequency modulation interferometry: the
self-referenced single-element dual-interferometer (SEDI) inertial sensor,
which takes simplification one step further by accommodating two
interferometers in one optic. Using a combination of computer models and
analytical methods we show that an inertial sensor with sub-picometer precision
for frequencies above 10 mHz, in a package of a few cubic inches, seems
feasible with our approach. Moreover we show that by combining two of these
devices it is possible to reach sub-picometer precision down to 2 mHz. In
combination with the given compactness, this makes the SEDI sensor a promising
approach for applications in high precision inertial sensing for both
next-generation space-based gravity missions employing drag-free control, and
ground-based experiments employing inertial isolation systems with optical

limited by inter-core crosstalk (IC-XT). Many existing researches treat IC-XT
as a static interference, however, recent research shows that IC-XT varies with
time, wavelength and baud rate. This inherent stochastic feature requires a
comprehensive characterization of the behaviour of MCF to its application in
practical transmission systems and the theoretical understanding of IC-XT
phenomenon. In this paper, we experimentally investigate the IC-XT behaviour of
an 8-core trench-assisted MCF in a temperature-controlled environment, using
popular modulation formats. We compare the measured results with the
theoretical prediction to validate the analytical IC-XT models previously
developed. Moreover, we explore the effects of the measurement configurations
on the IC-XT accuracy and present an analysis on the IC-XT step distribution.
Our results indicate that a number of transmission parameters have significant
influence on the strength and volatility of IC-XT. Moreover, the averaging time
of the power meter and the observation time window can affect the value of the
observed IC-XT, the degrees of the effects vary with the type of the source

different ad-hoc protocols for disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) - i.e. the
transfer of information through a network of nodes in contexts prone to signal
interruption/signal degradation - and to perform a trade-off analysis that will
yield a recommendation of the best course of action (COA) for a user of a
space-based network to employ. This is important for space-based networks in
particular since transmitting information over long distances - e.g. from
directly from the initial node to the destination node - will result in the
terminal signal being relatively weak, which is problematic in a high noise
(disruption-prone) environment since it will likely result in packet
degradation or loss unless signal power is increased to compensate. Given that
changing signal power for each transmission is impractical when one's network
is located in space, optimization of the signal route is the best means of
ensuring the transmitted signal reaches its destination rapidly and with
maximum fidelity. The recommended COA, as determined at the end of the
analysis, is one that optimizes performance in a fashion that minimizes error
during transmission and transmission time to the greatest extent possible. This
analysis takes into consideration the relative value of transmission time and
transmission error for a user of space-based communication systems (for
instance, a scientific mission - the most likely type of user for a space-based

time since even though a longer transmission time equals greater cost, a lower

being compromised) and provides a recommendation accordingly.

extracted from both RGB and depth as a final result, the state-of-the-art
(SOTA) bi-stream networks usually consist of two independent subbranches; i.e.,
one subbranch is used for RGB saliency and the other aims for depth saliency.
However, its depth saliency is persistently inferior to the RGB saliency
because the RGB component is intrinsically more informative than the depth
component. The bi-stream architecture easily biases its subsequent fusion
procedure to the RGB subbranch, leading to a performance bottleneck. In this
paper, we propose a novel data-level recombination strategy to fuse RGB with D

  of Water Borne Environmentally Hazardous Metal Ions","The selectivity and optical sensing ability of COOH-CdTe fluorescence
  nanosensor for the detection of different water borne environmentally
  hazardous metal ions have been tested",,"10.1016/j.optmat.2020.110584",,"physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this work, we have investigated the possibility of using COOH
functionalized CdTe quantum dots (QDs) as fluorescent nanosensor for the
detection of some environmentally hazardous metal ions ($\rm{Cr^{3+}}$,
$\rm{Pb^{2+}}$, $\rm{Cu^{2+}}$, $\rm{Zn^{2+}}$ and $\rm{Co^{2+}}$) in aqueous
phase. COOH-CdTe QDs are prepared in aqueous medium and characterized by
UV-visible, photo luminescence and FTIR spectrometry. Optical response of CdTe
nanosensor is observed to be time and temperature dependent. A strong
""Turn-Off"" fluorescence response of CdTe is observed in presence of all metals
ions ($\rm{X^{n+}}$). The output of Stern volmer relation, graphical Job's plot
and FTIR data established the existence of strong 1:1 complexation
($\rm{X^{n+}: ^{-}OOC-CdTe)}$ between CdTe and metal ions. CdTe shows its
efficient sensing ability for $\rm{Pb^{2+}}$, $\rm{Cr^{3+}}$ and $\rm{Cu^{2+}}$
ions up to concentration $\rm{10^{-14}}$ M which was established by its low
detection of limit (LOD)validation. Further, strong appearance of
$\frac{F-F_{0}}{F_{0}}$ establishes the better sensing capability of CdTe QDs
for $\rm{Cr^{3+}}$, $\rm{Pb^{2+}}$, $\rm{Cu^{2+}}$ ions which are far better
than the existing fluorescent sensors available in industry. The proposed
optical techniques and principal component analysis of sensing were
successfully applied for testing of dissolved metal ions in real samples like:
paint, river water, rain water etc which validates the applicability of COOH
functionalized CdTe nanosensor as a effective successful optical sensor for
water dissolved metal ions which are responsible for water pollution.

only the phase of Vapor, Liquid, Ice I and XI phase with a quasisolid phase
that shows the negative thermal extensibility but uniquely the slope of density
of water ice in different phases. Ice floats because H-O contracts less than
O:H expands in the QS phase at cooling.
