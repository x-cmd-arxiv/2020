$\hat{E}_{iv}^{va}$) are introduced. The presented procedure utilizes
L\""owdin's projection operator method of spin eigenfunction generation to

Here we assess the effect of the lock-down quantitatively for all regions in

Austria using near-real-time anonymized mobile phone data. We describe an
efficient data aggregation pipeline and analyze the mobility by quantifying
mobile-phone traffic at specific point of interest (POI), analyzing individual
trajectories and investigating the cluster structure of the origin-destination
graph. We found a reduction of commuters at Viennese metro stations of over
80\% and the number of devices with a radius of gyration of less than 500 m
almost doubled. The results of studying crowd-movement behavior highlight
considerable changes in the structure of mobility networks, revealed by a
higher modularity and an increase from 12 to 20 detected communities. We
demonstrate the relevance of mobility data for epidemiological studies by
showing a significant correlation of the outflow from the town of Ischgl (an
early COVID-19 hotspot) and the reported COVID-19 cases with an 8-day time lag.
This research indicates that mobile phone usage data permits the
moment-by-moment quantification of mobility behavior for a whole country. We

many graph-based representations and algorithms in the field of machine
learning and graph signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel graph
learning framework that incorporates the node-side and observation-side

dependency structures in graph signals. To this end, we consider graph signals
as functions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with a
Kronecker product kernel, and integrate functional learning with
smoothness-promoting graph learning to learn a graph representing the
relationship between nodes. The functional learning increases the robustness of
graph learning against missing and incomplete information in the graph signals.
In addition, we develop a novel graph-based regularisation method which, when
combined with the Kronecker product kernel, enables our model to capture both
the dependency explained by the graph and the dependency due to graph signals
observed under different but related circumstances, e.g. different points in
time. The latter means the graph signals are free from the i.i.d. assumptions
required by the classical graph learning models. Experiments on both synthetic

to characterize the uncertainty of the ponderomotive energy, directly
proportional to laser intensity. In particular, the quantum and classical
Fisher information for the momentum basis displays quadratic scaling over time.
This can be linked to above-threshold ionization interference rings for
measurements in the momentum basis and to the `ponderomotive phase' for the
`ideal' quantum measurements. Preferential scaling is found for increasing

measurements of laser intensity, that high resolution momentum spectroscopy has
the capacity to reduce the uncertainty by over $25$ times compared to

The exquisite precision of the space-based photometric surveys and
the unavoidable presence of instrumental systematics and intrinsic stellar
variability call for the development of sophisticated methods that separate
these signal components from those caused by planetary transits. AIMS. Here we
introduce tran_k2 a stand-alone Fortran code to search for planetary transits
under the colored noise of stellar variability and instrumental effects. With
this code we perform a survey for new candidates. METHODS. Stellar variability
is represented by a Fourier series, and, if needed, by an autoregressive model
to avoid excessive Gibbs overshoots at the edges. For the treatment of
systematics, cotrending and external parameter decorrelation are employed by
using cotrending stars with low stellar variability, the chip position and the
background flux level at the target. The filtering is made within the framework
of the standard weighted least squares, where the weights are determined
iteratively, to allow robust fit and separate the transit signal from stellar
variability and systematics. Once the periods of the transit components are
determined from the filtered data by the box-fitting least squares method, we
reconstruct the full signal and determine the transit parameters with a higher
accuracy. This step greatly reduces the excessive attenuation of the transit
depths and minimizes shape deformation. RESULTS. The code was tested on the
field of Campaign 5 of the K2 mission. We detected 98% of the systems with all
their candidate planets reported earlier by other authors, surveyed the whole
field and discovered 15 new systems. Additional 3 planets were found in 3

respect to different sinks are compatible with each other. The maximal stable
configuration is the simplest recurrent chip configuration, and graphs whose
recurrent identities equal the maximal stable configuration are of particular
interest, and are said to have the complete maximal identity property. We prove

of neutrinos from core-collapse supernova (CCSN). In the retrieval process, we
do not assume any analytic formulae to express the energy spectrum of neutrinos
but rather take a direct way of spectrum reconstruction from the observed data;
the Singular Value Decomposition algorithm with a newly developed adaptive
energy-gridding technique is adopted. We employ three independent reaction
channels having different flavor sensitivity to neutrinos. Two reaction
channels, inverse beta decay on proton and elastic scattering on electrons,
from a water Cherenkov detector such as Super-Kamiokande (SK) and
Hyper-Kamiokande (HK), and a charged current reaction channel with Argon from
the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) are adopted. Given neutrino
oscillation models, we iteratively search the neutrino energy spectra at the
CCSN source until they provide the consistent event counts in the three
reaction channels. We test the capability of our method by demonstrating the
spectrum retrieval to a theoretical neutrino data computed by our recent
three-dimensional CCSN simulation. Although the energy spectrum with either
electron-type or electron-type anti-neutrinos at the CCSN source has relatively
large error compared to that of other species, the joint analysis with HK +
DUNE or SK + DUNE will provide precise energy spectrum of all flavors of
neutrinos at the source. Finally, we discuss perspectives for improvements of
our method by using neutrino data of other detectors.

usability and acceptability of the robots. One of the valued features of such a
cohabitant robot is that it performs tasks that are instructed in natural
language. However, it is not trivial to execute the human intended tasks as
natural language expressions can have large linguistic variations. Existing
works assume either single task instruction is given to the robot at a time or
there are multiple independent tasks in an instruction. However, complex task
instructions composed of multiple inter-dependent tasks are not handled
efficiently in the literature. There can be ordering dependency among the
tasks, i.e., the tasks have to be executed in a certain order or there can be
execution dependency, i.e., input parameter or execution of a task depends on
the outcome of another task. Understanding such dependencies in a complex
instruction is not trivial if an unconstrained natural language is allowed. In
this work, we propose a method to find the intended order of execution of
multiple inter-dependent tasks given in natural language instruction. Based on

outperforms most of the other methods in the tasks of link prediction and

predicting human actions -- as opposed to predicting optimal actions -- has
received considerable attention. Existing work has focused on capturing human
behavior in an aggregate sense, which potentially limits the benefit any
particular individual could gain from interaction with these systems. We extend
this line of work by developing highly accurate predictive models of individual
human behavior in chess. Chess is a rich domain for exploring human-AI
interaction because it combines a unique set of properties: AI systems achieved
superhuman performance many years ago, and yet humans still interact with them
closely, both as opponents and as preparation tools, and there is an enormous

open-source version of AlphaZero trained on a population of human players, we
demonstrate that we can significantly improve prediction accuracy of a
particular player's moves by applying a series of fine-tuning methods.
Furthermore, our personalized models can be used to perform stylometry --
predicting who made a given set of moves -- indicating that they capture human

via the range separation (RS) of the interelectronic Coulomb operator, we
obtain accurate fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) energies with compact
multi-determinant trial wave functions. In particular, we combine here
short-range exchange-correlation functionals with a flavor of selected
configuration interaction (SCI) known as \emph{configuration interaction using
a perturbative selection made iteratively} (CIPSI), a scheme that we label
RS-DFT-CIPSI. One of the take-home messages of the present study is that
RS-DFT-CIPSI trial wave functions yield lower fixed-node energies with more
compact multi-determinant expansions than CIPSI, especially for small basis
sets. Indeed, as the CIPSI component of RS-DFT-CIPSI is relieved from
describing the short-range part of the correlation hole around the
electron-electron coalescence points, the number of determinants in the trial
wave function required to reach a given accuracy is significantly reduced as
compared to a conventional CIPSI calculation. Importantly, by performing
various numerical experiments, we evidence that the RS-DFT scheme essentially
plays the role of a simple Jastrow factor by mimicking short-range correlation
effects, hence avoiding the burden of performing a stochastic optimization.
Considering the 55 atomization energies of the Gaussian-1 benchmark set of
molecules, we show that using a fixed value of $\mu=0.5$~bohr$^{-1}$ provides
effective error cancellations as well as compact trial wave functions, making
the present method a good candidate for the accurate description of large

editors, as a glimpse ahead into the realm of dually weighted tensor models for
quantum gravity. This class of models allows one to consider a wider class of
quantum gravity models, in particular one can formulate state sum models of
spacetime with an intrinsic notion of foliation. The simplest one of these
models is the one proposed by Benedetti and Henson, which is a matrix model
formulation of two-dimensional Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT). In this
paper we apply the Functional Renormalization Group Equation (FRGE) to the
Benedetti-Henson model with the purpose of investigating the possible continuum
limits of this class of models. Possible continuum limits appear in this FRGE
approach as fixed points of the renormalization group flow where the size of
the matrix acts as the renormalization scale. Considering very small
truncations, we find fixed points that are compatible with analytically known
results for CDT in two dimensions. By studying the scheme dependence of our
results we find that precision results require larger truncations than the ones
considered in the present work. We conclude that our work suggests that the
FRGE is a useful exploratory tool for dually weighted matrix models. We thus
expect that the FRGE will be a useful exploratory tool for the investigation of
dually weighted tensor models for CDT in higher dimensions.

in shear flows. This so-called Reynolds analogy between advective heat or mass
transport and momentum transport hinders efficiency improvements in engineering
heat and mass transfer applications. I show through direct numerical
simulations that in plane Couette and Taylor-Couette flow rotation can strongly
influence wall-to-wall passive tracer transport and make it much faster than
momentum transport, clearly in violation of the Reynolds analogy. This
difference between passive tracer transport, representative of heat/mass
transport, and momentum transport is observed in steady flows with large
counter-rotating vortices at low Reynolds numbers as well as in fully turbulent
flows at higher Reynolds numbers. It is especially large near the neutral
(Rayleigh's) stability limit. The rotation-induced Coriolis force strongly
damps the streamwise/azimuthal velocity fluctuations when this limit is
approached while tracer fluctuations are much less affected. Accordingly,
momentum transport is much more reduced than tracer transport, showing that the
Coriolis force breaks the Reynolds analogy. At higher Reynolds numbers this
strong advective transport dissimilarity is accompanied by approximate limit

studies have investigated how the heart's electrical and mechanical activities

Coupling term. A new method to estimate the blood pressure including is
proposed which uses only the Electrocardiograph signal. In spite of studies
performed on feature extraction based on the signals' physiological parameters
(Parameter-based), in this work, the feature vectors are formed with samples of
the Electrocardiograph signal in a particular time frame (Whole-based) and
these vectors are input into Adaptive Boosting Regression to estimate blood
pressure. The nonlinear relationship which correlates blood pressure with the
Electrocardiograph signal is concluded by the results of this study. According
to the results, the used algorithms, for estimating both diastolic blood
pressures and mean arterial pressure, are in compliance with the standards of
the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. Also, according
to the British Hypertension Society standard, estimating diastolic blood
pressures and mean arterial pressure with the proposed method attain an A grade
while it achieves B for systolic blood pressure. The results indicate that
using the introduced method, blood pressure can be estimated continuously,
noninvasively, without cuff, calibration-free and by using only the

approximation for policy evaluation has achieved great success in modern

a stochastic nonconvex-strongly-concave optimization problem, which is
challenging as naive stochastic gradient descent-ascent algorithm suffers from
slow convergence. Existing approaches for this problem are based on
two-timescale or double-loop stochastic gradient algorithms, which may also
require sampling large-batch data. However, in practice, a single-timescale
single-loop stochastic algorithm is preferred due to its simplicity and also
because its step-size is easier to tune. In this paper, we propose two
single-timescale single-loop algorithms which require only one data point each
step. Our first algorithm implements momentum updates on both primal and dual
variables achieving an $O(\varepsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity, which shows the
important role of momentum in obtaining a single-timescale algorithm. Our
second algorithm improves upon the first one by applying variance reduction on
top of momentum, which matches the best known $O(\varepsilon^{-3})$ sample
complexity in existing works. Furthermore, our variance-reduction algorithm
does not require a large-batch checkpoint. Moreover, our theoretical results
for both algorithms are expressed in a tighter form of simultaneous primal and

administrations. To ensure the validity of test scores, the psychometric
properties of items should remain unchanged over time. In this paper, we
consider the sequential monitoring of test items, in particular, the detection
of abrupt changes to their psychometric properties, where a change can be
caused by, for example, leakage of the item or change of the corresponding
curriculum. We propose a statistical framework for the detection of abrupt
changes in individual items. This framework consists of (1) a multi-stream
Bayesian change point model describing sequential changes in items, (2) a
compound risk function quantifying the risk in sequential decisions, and (3)
sequential decision rules that control the compound risk. Throughout the
sequential decision process, the proposed decision rule balances the trade-off
between two sources of errors, the false detection of pre-change items and the
non-detection of post-change items. An item-specific monitoring statistic is
proposed based on an item response theory model that eliminates the confounding
from the examinee population which changes over time. Sequential decision rules
and their theoretical properties are developed under two settings: the oracle
setting where the Bayesian change point model is completely known and a more
realistic setting where some parameters of the model are unknown. Simulation
studies are conducted under settings that mimic real operational tests.

was developed during our re-analysis of the 1999-2000 VIGOR study, an 8076
patient randomized controlled trial (RCT), that compared the risk of adverse
events from a then newly approved drug, Rofecoxib (Vioxx), to that from an
older drug Naproxen. Vioxx was found to, on average and in comparison to
Naproxen, reduce the risk of gastrointestinal (GI) events but increase the risk
of thrombotic cardiovascular (CVT) events. Applying StaDISC, we fit 18 popular
conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimators for both outcomes and
use calibration to demonstrate their poor global performance. However, they are
locally well-calibrated and stable, enabling the identification of patient
groups with larger than (estimated) average treatment effects. In fact, StaDISC
discovers three clinically interpretable subgroups each for the GI outcome
(totaling 29.4% of the study size) and the CVT outcome (totaling 11.0%).
Complementary analyses of the found subgroups using the 2001-2004 APPROVe
study, a separate independently conducted RCT with 2587 patients, provides
further supporting evidence for the promise of StaDISC.

provides valuable information for optimal decision making. This paper reviewed
related studies conducted in the last 30 years (from 1991 to 2020) in handling
uncertainties in medical data using probability theory and machine learning
techniques. Medical data is more prone to uncertainty due to the presence of
noise in the data. So, it is very important to have clean medical data without
any noise to get accurate diagnosis. The sources of noise in the medical data
need to be known to address this issue. Based on the medical data obtained by
the physician, diagnosis of disease, and treatment plan are prescribed. Hence,
the uncertainty is growing in healthcare and there is limited knowledge to
address these problems. We have little knowledge about the optimal treatment
methods as there are many sources of uncertainty in medical science. Our
findings indicate that there are few challenges to be addressed in handling the
uncertainty in medical raw data and new models. In this work, we have
summarized various methods employed to overcome this problem. Nowadays,
application of novel deep learning techniques to deal such uncertainties have

experiment that aims to detect B-mode polarisation anisotropies in the CMB at
angular scales around the l=100 recombination peak. Systematic errors make
ground-based observations of B modes at millimetre wavelengths very challenging
and QUBIC mitigates these problems in a somewhat complementary way to other
existing or planned experiments using the novel technique of bolometric
interferometry. This technique takes advantage of the sensitivity of an imager
and the systematic error control of an interferometer. A cold reflective
optical combiner superimposes there-emitted beams from 400 aperture feedhorns
on two focal planes. A shielding system composedof a fixed groundshield, and a
forebaffle that moves with the instrument, limits the impact of local
contaminants. The modelling, design, manufacturing and preliminary measurements

  traveling waves, Floquet spectrum, spectral instability",,,,"math.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper studies both existence and spectral stability properties of
bounded spatially periodic traveling wave solutions to a large class of scalar
viscous balance laws in one space dimension with a reaction function of
monostable or Fisher-KPP type. Under suitable structural assumptions, it is
shown that this class of equations underlies two families of periodic waves.
The first family consists of small amplitude waves with finite fundamental
period which emerge from a Hopf bifurcation around a critical value of the wave
speed. The second family pertains to arbitrarily large period waves which arise
from a homoclinic bifurcation and tend to a limiting traveling (homoclinic)
pulse when their fundamental period tends to infinity. For both families, it is
shown that the Floquet (continuous) spectrum of the linearization around the
periodic waves intersects the unstable half plane of complex values with
positive real part, a property known as spectral instability. For that purpose,
in the case of small-amplitude waves it is proved that the spectrum of the
linearized operator around the wave can be approximated by that of a constant
coefficient operator around the zero solution and determined by a dispersion
relation which intersects the unstable complex half plane. In the case of large
period waves, we verify that the family satisfies the assumptions of the
seminal result by Gardner (1997, J. Reine Angew. Math. 491, pp. 149-181) of
convergence of periodic spectra in the infinite-period limit to that of the
underlying homoclinic wave, which is unstable. A few examples are discussed.

(UQ) is the ability to form accurate assessments of uncertainty having only
incomplete information about the distribution of random inputs. Another
challenge is to efficiently make use of limited training data for UQ
predictions of complex engineering problems, particularly with high dimensional
random parameters. We address these challenges by combining data-driven
polynomial chaos expansions with a recently developed preconditioned sparse
approximation approach for UQ problems. The first task in this two-step process
is to employ the procedure developed in (Ahlfeld et al. 2016) to construct an
""arbitrary"" polynomial chaos expansion basis using a finite number of
statistical moments of the random inputs. The second step is a novel procedure
to effect sparse approximation via $\ell^1$ minimization in order to quantify
the forward uncertainty. To enhance the performance of the preconditioned
$\ell^1$ minimization problem, we sample from the so-called induced
distribution, instead of using Monte Carlo (MC) sampling from the original,
unknown probability measure. We demonstrate on test problems that induced
sampling is a competitive and often better choice compared with sampling from
asymptotically optimal measures (such as the equilibrium measure) when we have
incomplete information about the distribution. We demonstrate the capacity of
the proposed induced sampling algorithm via sparse representation with limited
data on test functions, and on a Kirchoff plating bending problem with random
Young's modulus.

condition preservation. To better suit BA-based VSLAM back-ends, the Good Graph
predicts future estimation needs, dynamically assigns an appropriate size

Evaluations are conducted on two scenarios: 1) VSLAM as standalone process, and
2) VSLAM as part of closed-loop navigation system. Results from the first
scenario show Good Graph improves accuracy and robustness of VSLAM estimation,
when computational limits exist. Results from the second scenario, indicate
that Good Graph benefits the trajectory tracking performance of VSLAM-based
closed-loop navigation systems, which is a primary application of VSLAM.

to the non trivial modification of the gluon emission spectrum. In the multiple
soft scattering regime, for sufficiently large media, soft and wide angle
emissions can be resummed (in the planar limit of QCD) due to the small
formation time of each gluon emission. Similarly to DGLAP evolution, such
cascades correspond to pure Markovian processes and interferences between
partons are neglected. In this strict limit, color coherence effects are
absent. In the vacuum this coherence effect is critical to guarantee that the
shower is angular ordered. In the medium, it is known that such color coherence
effects might play a role in suppressing radiation at intermediate emission
angles. We present a simple procedure to implement color (de)coherence effects
into the in-medium evolution equations obtained in the pure Markovian
approximation. We verify that the result obtained is in accordance with
previous studies regarding the role of in-medium color coherence in the
evolution of the QCD antenna. The new evolution equation incorporates a novel
emission kernel which enforces color coherence between emitters.

fields (including Orientale, Copernicus, and Kepler) we provide three new
constraints on these issues: 1) estimation of the maximum secondary crater size

the size and velocity of ejecta fragments that formed these secondaries, and 3)
estimation of the fragment size ejected at escape velocity. Through this
analysis, we confirmed and extended a suspected scale-dependent trend in ejecta
size-velocity distributions. Maximum ejecta fragment sizes fall off much more
steeply with increasing ejection velocity for larger primary impacts (compared
to smaller primary impacts). Specifically, we characterize the maximum ejecta
sizes for a given ejection velocity with a power law, and find the velocity
exponent varies between approximately -0.3 and -3 for the range of primary
craters investigated here (0.83-660 km in diameter). Data for the jovian moons

learning a dynamical system from noisy observations of a few trajectories and
subject to side information. Side information is any knowledge we might have
about the dynamical system we would like to learn besides trajectory data. It
is typically inferred from domain-specific knowledge or basic principles of a
scientific discipline. We are interested in explicitly integrating side
information into the learning process in order to compensate for scarcity of
trajectory observations. We identify six types of side information that arise
naturally in many applications and lead to convex constraints in the learning
problem. First, we show that when our model for the unknown dynamical system is
parameterized as a polynomial, one can impose our side information constraints
computationally via semidefinite programming. We then demonstrate the added
value of side information for learning the dynamics of basic models in physics
and cell biology, as well as for learning and controlling the dynamics of a
model in epidemiology. Finally, we study how well polynomial dynamical systems
can approximate continuously-differentiable ones while satisfying side
information (either exactly or approximately). Our overall learning methodology
combines ideas from convex optimization, real algebra, dynamical systems, and
functional approximation theory, and can potentially lead to new synergies
between these areas.

certifying the performance of the ML algorithms in the face of their
overwhelming complexity poses a need for rethinking the traditional notions of
model architecture selection, sensitivity analysis and stress testing. Our
point of view is that the phenomenon of adversarial perturbations when detached
from the AI security domain, has purely algorithmic roots and fall within the
scope of model risk assessment. We propose a model criticism and explanation
framework based on adversarially generated counterfactual examples for tabular
data. A counterfactual example to a given instance in this context is defined
as a synthetically generated data point sampled from the estimated data
distribution which is treated differently by a model. The counterfactual
examples can be used to provide a black-box instance-level explanation of the
model behaviour as well as studying the regions in the input space where the
model performance deteriorates. Adversarial example generating algorithms are
extensively studied in the image and natural language processing (NLP) domains.
However, most financial data come in tabular format and naive application of
the existing techniques on this class of datasets generates unrealistic
samples. In this paper, we propose a counterfactual example generation method
capable of handling tabular data including discrete and categorical variables.
Our proposed algorithm uses a gradient-free optimization based on genetic
algorithms and therefore is applicable to any classification model.

each observation band was well-defined, and the bandwidths were appropriately
specified. Moreover, the receiver noise temperature and the image rejection
ratio (IRR) using the superconducting mixer at 4 K were measured. As a result,
the increase in receiver noise due to the multiplexer compared with that of
only the mixer can be attributed to the transmission loss of the waveguide
circuit in the multiplexer. The IRRs were higher than 25 dB at the center of
each observation band. This indicates that a high and stable IRR performance
can be achieved by the waveguide-type multiplexer for the separation of

shown that the resolved waves contribute to both eastward and westward
accelerations near the equator, mainly by the way of the vertical flux of zonal
momentum. The eastward accelerations by the resolved waves are mainly due to
Kelvin waves and small-scale gravity (SSG) waves with zonal wavelengths smaller
than 2000 km, whereas the westward accelerations are forced mainly by SSG
waves, with smaller contributions from inertio-gravity and mixed-Rossby-gravity
waves. Extratropical Rossby waves propagate into the tropical region and impart
a westward acceleration to the zonal flow. They appear to be responsible for at
least some of the irregularities in the QBO cycle.

and ""inside status"" (desire to be perceived talented from peers inside their

each agent firstly chooses her group and secondly chooses her action in the
group she chose. They face binary choice problems both in group and action
choices. Using cutoff strategy, we construct an partially separating
equilibrium such that there are four populations: (i) choosing high group with
strong incentive for action in the group, (ii) high group with weak incentive,
(iii) low group with strong incentive, and (iv) low group with weak incentive.
By comparative statics results, we find some spillover effects from a certain

examined in the ERA5 reanalysis and compared with those in ERA-I. Because of
ERA5's higher spatial resolution it is capable of resolving a broader spectrum
of atmospheric waves and allows for a better representation of the wave-mean
flow interactions, both of which are of crucial importance for QBO studies. It
is shown that the QBO-induced mean meridional circulation, which is mainly
confined to the winter hemisphere, is strong enough to interrupt the tropical
upwelling during the descent of the westerly shear zones. Since the momentum
advection tends to damp the QBO, the wave forcing is responsible for both the
downward propagation and for the maintenance of the QBO. It is shown that half
the required wave forcing is provided by resolved waves during the descent of
both westerly and easterly regimes. Planetary-scale waves account for most of
the resolved wave forcing of the descent of westerly shear zones and
small-scale gravity (SSG) waves with wavelengths shorter than 2000 km account
for the remainder. SSG waves account for most of the resolved forcing of the
descent of the easterly shear zones. The representation of the mean fields in
the QBO is very similar in ERA5 and ERA-I but the resolved wave forcing is
shown to be substantially stronger in ERA5. The contributions of the various
equatorially-trapped wave modes to the QBO forcing are documented in Part II.

responses from gold nanocrescent (Au NC) antennas which have wavelength and
polarization sensitive LSPRs in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range.
The wavelength dependence of the SH intensity exhibits spectral profiles
different from dipole LSPR bands in absorbance spectra. The incident
polarization angle dependence was found to vary significantly when the
excitation wavelength was tuned over the dipole band. Finite-difference
time-domain calculations coupled with a nonlinear hydrodynamic model were
carried out for Au NC arrays to investigate the local field enhancement of the

results indicate that the effects of higher order LSPRs, such as quadrupole and

areas with no identifiable craters to heavily cratered terrains. This variation
in crater densities is consistent with geologic activity occurring throughout
Pluto's history and also a variety of resurfacing styles, including both
exogenic and endogenic processes. Using estimates of impact flux and cratering
rates over time, Pluto's heavily cratered terrains appear to be relatively
ancient, 4 Ga or older. Charon's smooth plains, informally named Vulcan
Planitia, did experience early resurfacing, but there is a relatively high
spatial density of craters on Vulcan Planitia and almost all overprint the
other types of volcanic or tectonic features. Both Vulcan Planitia and the
northern terrains on Charon are also estimated to be ancient, 4 Ga or older.
The craters on Pluto and Charon also show a distinct break in their
size-frequency distributions (SFDs), where craters smaller than approximately
10-15 km in diameter have a shallower SFD power-law slope than those larger
than this break diameter. This SFD shape on Pluto and Charon is different than
what is observed on the Earth's Moon, and gives the Kuiper belt impactor SFD a
different shape than that of the asteroid belt.

only exchanging the low-dimensional intermediate local information with their

by exploiting the sparsity-promoting and similarity-promoting terms of the
device state vectors among neighboring APs. An approximate splitting approach
is proposed based on the proximal gradient method for solving the formulated

for electron correlations and including spin-orbit coupling and dipolar

local MSE variance at a given altitude and the covariance of MSE anomalies
between different altitudes. Here we present a vertically resolved (VR) MSE
framework that focuses on the local MSE variance to study convective

development of self-aggregation is associated with an increase of local MSE
variance, and that the diabatic and adiabatic generation of the MSE variance is
mainly dominated by the boundary layer (BL). The results agree with recent
numerical simulation results and the available potential energy analyses
showing that the BL plays a key role in the development of self-aggregation. We
further present a detailed comparison between the global and local MSE variance

However, CMMD does not work well on complex distributions, especially when the

learning method is proposed to improve the discrimination performance of CMMD.
It can be operated with deep network features iteratively and thus denoted as

an injective function. By considering the compound kernel, i.e., the injective

category description is enhanced. KLN can simultaneously learn a more
expressive kernel and label prediction distribution, thus, it can be used to
improve the classification performance in both supervised and semi-supervised
learning scenarios. In particular, the kernel-based similarities are
iteratively learned on the deep network features, and the algorithm can be
implemented in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on
four benchmark datasets, including MNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The

to symmetry arguments and high-throughput first-principles calculations, we
identify a family of ideal 2D Dirac semimetals, which has nonzero Berry
curvature in the vicinity of Dirac points and visible edge states, thus
facilitating the experimental observations. Our work shows that 2D Dirac points

classification of 2D topological semimetals but also provides a promising
avenue to observe exotic transport phenomena beyond graphene, e.g., nonlinear

effects, primarily due to unphysical interactions between crystalline nuclei
and their periodic images. It is, however, not always feasible to
systematically investigate the sensitivity of nucleation kinetics and mechanism
to system size due to large computational costs of nucleation studies. Here, we
use jumpy forward flux sampling to accurately compute the rates of
heterogeneous ice nucleation in the vicinity of square-shaped model
structureless ice nucleating particles (INPs) of different sizes, and identify
three distinct regimes for the dependence of rate on the INP dimension, $L$.
For small INPs, the rate is a strong function of $L$ due to artificial spanning
of critical nuclei across the periodic boundary. Intermediate-sized INPs,
however, give rise to the emergence of non-spanning 'proximal` nuclei that are
close enough to their periodic images to fully structure the intermediary
liquid. While such proximity can facilitate nucleation, its effect is offset by
the higher density of the intermediary liquid, leading to artificially small
nucleation rates overall. The critical nuclei formed at large INPs are neither
spanning nor proximal. Yet, the rate is a weak function of $L$, with its
logarithm scaling linearly with $1/L$. The key heuristic emerging from these
observations is that finite size effects will be minimal if critical nuclei are
neither spanning nor proximal, and if the intermediary liquid has a region that
is structurally indistinguishable from the supercooled liquid under the same
conditions.

give a rigorous interpretation of our method, and prove that it returns sets
which are guaranteed to converge to the convex hull of the true reachable sets.
Additionally, we leverage recent work on robust deep learning and propose a new
adversarial sampling approach to robustify our algorithm and accelerate its
convergence. We demonstrate that our method is faster and less conservative
than prior work, present results for approximate reachability analysis of
neural networks and robust trajectory optimization of high-dimensional
uncertain nonlinear systems, and discuss future applications.

paramagnetic to the lowest temperature. While this can be simply explained by a
core-shell picture in that the contribution from the interior state disappears

Such a large length scale signifies the coherence length of the nonlocality of
the quantum entangled excitations in quantum spin liquid candidate, similar to

perspective of Bayesian hierarchical models and present a novel penalty called
Hierarchical Adaptive Lasso (HALO) which learns to adaptively sparsify weights
of a given network via trainable parameters. When used to train
over-parametrized networks, our penalty yields small subnetworks with high
accuracy without fine-tuning. Empirically, on image recognition tasks, we find
that HALO is able to learn highly sparse network (only 5% of the parameters)
with significant gains in performance over state-of-the-art magnitude pruning

driven by a L\'{e}vy subordinator and an independent sinusoidal-composite
L\'{e}vy process. The former component captures short-term dependence in the
instantaneous volatility, while the latter is introduced expressly for
rectifying the activity level of the average forward variance. Such a framework
ensures that the characteristic function of average forward variance is
obtainable in semi-closed form, without having to invoke any geometric-mean
approximations. To analyze swaps and European-style options on average forward
volatility, we introduce a general class of power-type derivatives on the
average forward variance, which also provide flexible nonlinear leverage
exposure. Pricing-hedging formulae are based on a modified numerical Fourier

systems. We consider a standard linear time-invariant system with random
process and measurement noises. For such a system, eavesdroppers having access
to system output trajectories may infer the system initial states, leading to
initial-value privacy risks. When a finite number of output trajectories are
eavesdropped, we consider a requirement that any guess about the initial values
can be plausibly denied. When an infinite number of output trajectories are
eavesdropped, we consider a requirement that the initial values should not be
uniquely recoverable. In view of these two privacy requirements, we define
differential initial-value privacy and intrinsic initial-value privacy,
respectively, for the system as metrics of privacy risks. First of all, we
prove that the intrinsic initial-value privacy is equivalent to
unobservability, while the differential initial-value privacy can be achieved
for a privacy budget depending on an extended observability matrix of the
system and the covariance of the noises. Next, the inherent network nature of
the considered linear system is explored, where each individual state
corresponds to a node and the state and output matrices induce interaction and
sensing graphs, leading to a network system. Under this network system
perspective, we allow the initial states at some nodes to be public, and
investigate the resulting intrinsic initial-value privacy of each individual
node. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for such individual node
initial-value privacy, and also prove that the intrinsic initial-value privacy
of individual nodes is generically determined by the network structure. These
results may be extended to linear systems with time-varying dynamics under the
same analysis framework.

between biases in the estimated parameters and inaccurate modelling of
non-linear redshift-space distortions for the power spectrum and bispectrum of
projected galaxy density fields and lensing convergence. Non-linear
redshift-space distortions are one of the leading systematic uncertainties in
galaxy clustering. Projections along the line of sight suppress radial modes
and are thus allowing a trade-off between biases due to non-linear
redshift-space distortions and statistical uncertainties. We investigate this
bias-error trade-off for a CMASS-like survey with a varying number of redshift
bins. Improved modelling of the non-linear redshift-space distortions allows
the recovery of more radial information when controlling for biases. Not
modelling non-linear redshift space distortions inflates error bars for almost
all parameters by 20%. The information loss for the amplitude of local
non-Gaussianities is smaller, since it is best constrained from large scales.

treated as post-processing, adds an extra phase in the production of privatized
data. It is well understood in the theory of multi-phase processing that
congeniality, a form of procedural compatibility between phases, is a
prerequisite for the end users to straightforwardly obtain statistically valid
results. Congenial differential privacy is theoretically principled, which
facilitates transparency and intelligibility of the mechanism that would
otherwise be undermined by ad-hoc post-processing procedures. We advocate for
the systematic integration of mandated disclosure into the design of the
privacy mechanism via standard probabilistic conditioning on the invariant
margins. Conditioning automatically renders congeniality because any extra
post-processing phase becomes unnecessary. We provide both initial theoretical
guarantees and a Markov chain algorithm for our proposal. We also discuss
intriguing theoretical issues that arise in comparing congenital differential
privacy and optimization-based post-processing, as well as directions for
further research.

another opportunity for the IoT to support more advanced and real-time services
that could not have been previously supported. However, the simple integration
of such technologies into the IoT does not take full advantage of MEC and
network slicing or the reduction of latency and traffic prioritization,
respectively. Therefore, there is a strong need for an efficient integration
mechanism for IoT platforms to maximize the benefit of using such technologies.
In this article, we introduce a novel architectural framework that enables the
virtualization of an IoT platform with minimum functions to support specific
IoT services and host the instance in an edge node, close to the end-user. As
the instance provides its service at the edge node where the MEC node and
network slice are located, the traffic for the end-user does not need to
traverse back to the cloud. This architecture guarantees not only low latency
but also efficient management of IoT services at the edge node. To show the
feasibility of the proposed architecture, we conduct an experimental evaluation
by comparing the transmission time of both IoT services running on the central
cloud and those using sliced IoT functions in the edge gateway. The results
show that the proposed architecture provides two times faster transmission time
than that from the conventional cloud-based IoT platform.

the Virgo cluster is obtained from archival images of the Hubble Space

discontinuity) is found to vary with galactocentric distance. This variation
can be interpreted as the effect of metal-rich red giants on the procedure of
the measurement of the TRGB discontinuity or as a consequence of the existence
of a weak gas-and-dust cloud around M87 extending out to $10^\prime$ along the
galactocentric radius and causing $I$-band absorption of up to $0.^m2$ near the
center of the galaxy. The TRGB stars located far from the M87 center yield an
average distance modulus of $(m-M) = 30.91\pm0.08$, which corresponds to the
distance of $D=15.4\pm0.6$ Mpc. It is shown that stars in the field located
between M86 and M87 galaxies at angular separations of $37^\prime$ and
$40^\prime$ are not intergalactic stars, but belong to the M87 galaxy, i.e.,
that the stellar halo of this galaxy can be clearly seen at a galactocentric
distance of 190 kpc. The distances are measured to four dwarf galaxies P4anon,
NGC4486A, VCCA039, and dSph-D07, whose images can be seen in the fields

comprehend the physical and chemical properties of a given compound. To explore
changes in chemical bonding in lead chalcogenides (PbX, where X = Te, Se, S,
O), a combination of property-, bond breaking- and quantum-mechanical bonding
descriptors have been applied. The outcome of our explorations reveals an
electron transfer driven transition from metavalent bonding in PbX (X = Te, Se,
S) to iono-covalent bonding in beta-PbO. Metavalent bonding is characterized by
adjacent atoms being held together by sharing about a single electron and small
electron transfer (ET). The transition from metavalent to iono-covalent bonding
manifests itself in clear changes in these quantum-mechanical descriptors (ES
and ET), as well as in property-based descriptors (i.e. Born effective charge,
dielectric function, effective coordination number (ECON) and mode-specific
Grueneisen parameter, and in bond breaking descriptors (PME). Metavalent
bonding collapses, if significant charge localization occurs at the ion cores
(ET) and/or in the interatomic region (ES). Predominantly changing the degree
of electron transfer opens possibilities to tailor materials properties such as
the chemical bond and electronic polarizability, optical band gap and optical
interband transitions characterized by the imaginary part of the dielectric
function. Hence, the insights gained from this study highlight the
technological relevance of the concept of metavalent bonding and its potential
for materials design.

gas have been observed toward 18 stars in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of
the Galaxy. Their longitude-velocity diagram indicates that the gas is radially
expanding within the CMZ at speeds up to a maximum of $\sim$150 km s$^{-1}$.
The current momentum and energy in the gas are $\sim 5 \times 10^8 M_\odot$ km
s$^{-1}$ and $\sim 5\times 10^{53}$ erg. The motion is similar to that of the
Expanding Molecular Ring (EMR) discovered in 1972 by Kaifu et al. and by
Scoville. We propose that the expanding gas seen in H$_3^+$ is part of the same
phenomenon, in spite of differences in estimates of density, morphology, and
degree of rotation. The outward motion suggests that one or more ejection
events occurred near the center of the CMZ (0.5$-$1) $\times$ 10$^6$ years ago,
which may be related to creation of the recently observed microwave bubble.
These observations revive the circular face-on view of the CMZ proposed in
1972, which fell out of favor after 1991 when Binney et al. proposed that a
face-on view of the CMZ would show it to have an elliptical shape, with high
eccentricity. While that model may apply on kiloparsec scales, we argue that it
is incorrect to apply it to the much smaller CMZ. We discuss the fate of the
expanding gas, which appears to be eventual infall into the center, leading to
episodes of star formation and violent events associated with accretion onto
Sgr~A$^\ast$.

This was achieved by using the process of high-harmonic generation in atoms, in
which the photons of a driving laser pulse of infrared frequency are
up-converted into photons of higher frequencies in the extreme ultraviolet
spectral range. The quantum state of the fundamental mode after the
interaction, when conditioned on the high-harmonic generation, is a so-called
Schr\""odinger cat state, which corresponds to a superposition of two distinct
coherent states: the initial state of the laser and the coherent state reduced
in amplitude that results from the interaction with atoms. The results open the
path for investigations towards the control of the non-classical states,
exploiting conditioning approaches on physical processes relevant to
high-harmonic generation.

(MIMO) with lens antenna arrays, which is also known as ""beamspace MIMO"", can
effectively reduce the required number of power-hungry radio frequency (RF)
chains. Therefore, it has been considered as a promising technique for the
upcoming 5G communications and beyond. However, most current studies on
beamspace MIMO have not taken into account the important power leakage problem
in beamspace channels, which possibly leads to a significant degradation in the
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the system sum-rate. To this end, we propose a
beam aligning precoding method to handle the power leakage problem in this
paper. Firstly, a phase shifter network (PSN) structure is proposed, which
enables each RF chain in beamspace MIMO to select multiple beams to collect the
leakage power. Then, a rotation-based precoding algorithm is designed based on
the proposed PSN structure, which aligns the channel gains of the selected
beams towards the same direction for maximizing the received SNR at each user.
Furthermore, we reveal some system design insights by analyzing the sum-rate
and energy efficiency (EE) of the proposed beam aligning precoding method. In
simulations, the proposed approach is found to achieve the near-optimal
sum-rate performance compared with the ideal case of no power leakage, and
obtains a higher EE than the existing schemes with either a linear or planar
array.

  Moment Retrieval","16 pages, 6 figures, European Conference on Computer Vision, 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) is a task to localize the temporal moment in
untrimmed video specified by natural language query. For VMR, several methods
that require full supervision for training have been proposed. Unfortunately,
acquiring a large number of training videos with labeled temporal boundaries
for each query is a labor-intensive process. This paper explores methods for
performing VMR in a weakly-supervised manner (wVMR): training is performed
without temporal moment labels but only with the text query that describes a
segment of the video. Existing methods on wVMR generate multi-scale proposals
and apply query-guided attention mechanisms to highlight the most relevant
proposal. To leverage the weak supervision, contrastive learning is used which
predicts higher scores for the correct video-query pairs than for the incorrect
pairs. It has been observed that a large number of candidate proposals, coarse
query representation, and one-way attention mechanism lead to blurry attention
maps which limit the localization performance. To handle this issue,
Video-Language Alignment Network (VLANet) is proposed that learns sharper
attention by pruning out spurious candidate proposals and applying a
multi-directional attention mechanism with fine-grained query representation.
The Surrogate Proposal Selection module selects a proposal based on the
proximity to the query in the joint embedding space, and thus substantially
reduces candidate proposals which leads to lower computation load and sharper
attention. Next, the Cascaded Cross-modal Attention module considers dense
feature interactions and multi-directional attention flow to learn the
multi-modal alignment. VLANet is trained end-to-end using contrastive loss
which enforces semantically similar videos and queries to gather. The
experiments show that the method achieves state-of-the-art performance on
Charades-STA and DiDeMo datasets.

Most of the existing studies are based on the definition of approaching and
exit lanes. The route a vehicle takes to pass through an intersection is
determined from its movement. That is, only the origin and destination arms are
included. This study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model
to optimize vehicle trajectories at an isolated ``signal-free'' intersection
without lane allocation, which is denoted as ``lane-allocation-free'' (LAF)
control. Each lane can be used as both approaching and exit lanes for all
vehicle movements including left-turn, through, and right-turn. A vehicle can
take a flexible route by way of multiple arms to pass through the intersection.
In this way, the spatial-temporal resources are expected to be fully utilized.
The interactions between vehicle trajectories are modeled explicitly at the
microscopic level. Vehicle routes and trajectories (i.e., car-following and
lane-changing behaviors) at the intersection are optimized in one unified
framework for system optimality in terms of total vehicle delay. Considering
varying traffic conditions, the planning horizon is adaptively adjusted in the
implementation procedure of the proposed model to make a balance between
solution feasibility and computational burden. Numerical studies validate the
advantages of the proposed LAF control in terms of both vehicle delay and
throughput with different demand structures and temporal safety gaps.

of four-quark states with functional methods. Model approaches to those exotic
mesons almost inevitably have to assume certain internal structures, e.g. by
grouping quarks and antiquarks into (anti-)diquark clusters or heavy-light
$q\bar{q}$ pairs. Functional methods using Dyson-Schwinger and Bethe-Salpeter
equations can be formulated without such prejudice and therefore have the
potential to put these assumptions to test and discriminate between such

scalar-meson sector and the heavy-light sector with a pair of charmed and a
pair of light quarks in different quantum number channels. For all these
states, the dominant components in terms of internal two-body clustering have
been identified. It turns out that chiral symmetry breaking plays an important
role for the dominant clusters in the light meson sector (in particular for the
scalar mesons) and that this property is carried over to the heavy-light
sector. Diquark-antidiquark components, on the other hand, turn out to be
almost negligible for most states with the exception of open-charm heavy-light
exotics.

mode instead of the currently used LG00 mode. However, the simultaneous
reduction of quantum noise would then require the efficient generation of
squeezed vacuum states in the LG33 mode. Current squeezed light generation
techniques employ continuous-wave second harmonic generation (SHG). Here, we
simulate the SHG for both modes numerically to derive first insights into the
transferability of standard squeezed light generation techniques to the LG33
mode. In the first part of this paper, we therefore theoretically discuss SHG
in the case of a single undepleted pump mode, which, in general, excites a
superposition of harmonic modes. Based on the differential equation for the
harmonic field, we derive individual phase matching conditions and hence
conversion efficiencies for the excited harmonic modes. In the second part, we
analyse the numerical simulations of the LG00 and LG33 SHG in a single-pass,
double-pass and cavity-enhanced configuration under the influence of the
focusing, the different pump intensity distributions and the individual phase
matching conditions. Our results predict that the LG33 mode requires about 14
times the pump power of the LG00 mode to achieve the same SHG conversion
efficiency in an ideal, realistic cavity design and mainly generates the
harmonic LG66 mode.

accelerating electrons during a CME eruption. So far, studies have relied on
the traditional classification of solar radio bursts into five groups (Type

we aim to determine the origin of moving radio bursts associated with a CME
that do not fit into the present classification of the solar radio emission.
Methods. By using radio imaging from the Nan\c{c}ay Radioheliograph, combined

We identified three moving radio bursts at unusually high altitudes in the
corona that are located at the northern CME flank and move outwards
synchronously with the CME. The radio bursts correspond to fine-structured
emission in dynamic spectra with durations of ~1 s, and they may show forward
or reverse frequency drifts. Since the CME expands closely following an earlier
CME, a low coronal CME-CME interaction is likely responsible for the observed
radio emission.

exit tunnel with the consideration of a real shape atomistic tunnel based on
the Protein Data Bank (PDB) structure of the large ribosome subunit of archeon
Haloarcula marismortui. Molecular dynamics simulations employing the Go-like
model for the proteins show that at intermediate and high temperatures,
including a presumable physiological temperature, the protein escape process at
the atomistic tunnel is quantitatively similar to that at a cylinder tunnel of
length L = 72 {\AA} and diameter d = 16 {\AA}. At low temperatures, the
atomistic tunnel, however, yields an increased probability of protein trapping
inside the tunnel while the cylinder tunnel does not cause the trapping.
All-$\beta$ proteins tend to escape faster than all-$\alpha$ proteins but this
difference is blurred on increasing the protein's chain length. A 29-residue
zinc-finger domain is shown to be severely trapped inside the tunnel. Most of
the single-domain proteins considered, however, can escape efficiently at the
physiological temperature with the escape time distribution following the
diffusion model proposed in our previous works. An extrapolation of the
simulation data to a realistic value of the friction coefficient for amino
acids indicates that the escape times of globular proteins are at the
sub-millisecond scale. It is argued that this time scale is short enough for

responsible for complex lighting effects including diffuse, specular,
inter-reflection and self shadowing. Most existing methods for estimating the
face reflectance from a monocular image assume faces to be diffuse with very
few approaches adding a specular component. This still leaves out important
perceptual aspects of reflectance as higher-order global illumination effects
and self-shadowing are not modeled. We present a new neural representation for
face reflectance where we can estimate all components of the reflectance
responsible for the final appearance from a single monocular image. Instead of
modeling each component of the reflectance separately using parametric models,
our neural representation allows us to generate a basis set of faces in a
geometric deformation-invariant space, parameterized by the input light
direction, viewpoint and face geometry. We learn to reconstruct this
reflectance field of a face just from a monocular image, which can be used to
render the face from any viewpoint in any light condition. Our method is
trained on a light-stage training dataset, which captures 300 people
illuminated with 150 light conditions from 8 viewpoints. We show that our
method outperforms existing monocular reflectance reconstruction methods, in
terms of photorealism due to better capturing of physical premitives, such as
sub-surface scattering, specularities, self-shadows and other higher-order
effects.

into three subsamples: active region (AR) CMEs, disappearing filament (DSF)
CMEs, and stealthy CMEs. The related three groups of ICMEs were further divided
into two subsets: magnetic obstacle (MO) events (out of which four were
stealthy), covering ICMEs that at least partly expose characteristics of flux
ropes, and ejecta (EJ) events, not showing such characteristics. In the next
step, MO-events were analysed in more detail, considering the magnetic field
strengths and the plasma characteristics in three different segments of the
ICMEs, defined as the turbulent sheath (TS), the frontal region (FR), and the
MO itself. The analysis revealed various well-defined correlations for AR, DSF,

pose the problem as an image classification (Normal or Abnormal) problem. These
systems achieve high to very high accuracy in specific disease detection for
which they are trained but lack in terms of an explanation for the provided
decision/classification result. The activation maps which correspond to
decisions do not correlate well with regions of interest for specific diseases.
This paper examines this problem and proposes an approach which mimics the
clinical practice of looking for an evidence prior to diagnosis. A CAD model is
learnt using a mixed set of information: class labels for the entire training
set of images plus a rough localisation of suspect regions as an extra input
for a smaller subset of training images for guiding the learning. The proposed
approach is illustrated with detection of diabetic macular edema (DME) from OCT
slices. Results of testing on on a large public dataset show that with just a
third of images with roughly segmented fluid filled regions, the classification
accuracy is on par with state of the art methods while providing a good
explanation in the form of anatomically accurate heatmap /region of interest.
The proposed solution is then adapted to Breast Cancer detection from
mammographic images. Good evaluation results on public datasets underscores the
generalisability of the proposed solution.

comparing the classifiers trained directly on true orthophotos vis-a-vis first
training them on the off-nadir images and subsequently translating the

years from 400 schools spread in five different urban areas of Greece. A follow

age group from 500 school units in six different prefectures of Greece. To our

  Discretizations With Hyperelasticity","20 pages, 6 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In aerospace engineering and boat building, fluid-structure interaction
models are considered to investigate prototypes before they are physically
assembled. How a material interacts with different fluids at different Reynold
numbers has to be studied before it is passed over to the manufacturing
process. In addition, examining the same model not only for different fluids
but also for different solids allows to optimize the choice of materials for
construction even better. A possible answer on this demand is
parameter-dependent discretization. Furthermore, low-rank techniques can reduce
the complexity needed to compute approximations to parameter-dependent
fluid-structure interaction discretizations.
  Low-rank methods have been applied to parameter-dependent linear
fluid-structure interaction discretizations. The linearity of the operators
involved allows to translate the resulting equations to a single matrix
equation. The solution is approximated by a low-rank method. In this paper, we
propose a new method that extends this framework to nonlinear
parameter-dependent fluid-structure interaction problems by means of the Newton
iteration. The parameter set is split into disjoint subsets. On each subset,
the Newton approximation of the problem related to the upper median parameter
is computed and serves as initial guess for one Newton step on the whole
subset. This Newton step yields a matrix equation whose solution can be
approximated by a low-rank method.
  The resulting method requires a smaller number of Newton steps if compared
with a direct approach that applies the Newton iteration to the separate
problems consecutively. In the experiments considered, the proposed method
allowed to compute a low-rank approximation within a twentieth of the time used
by the direct approach.

recommendations impact the experience and growth of each participant in the

and constraints of different stakeholders in order to find utility of an item
for recommendation. Constrained-optimization based approaches to this problem
typically involve complex formulations and have high computational complexity
in production settings involving millions of entities. Simplifications and
relaxation techniques (for example, scalarization) help but introduce
sub-optimality and can be time-consuming due to the amount of tuning needed. In
this paper, we introduce a method involving multi-goal sampling followed by
ranking for user-relevance (Sample-Rank), to nudge recommendations towards
multi-objective (MO) goals of the marketplace. The proposed method's novelty is
that it reduces the MO recommendation problem to sampling from a desired
multi-goal distribution then using it to build a production-friendly
learning-to-rank (LTR) model. In offline experiments we show that we are able
to bias recommendations towards MO criteria with acceptable trade-offs in
metrics like AUC and NDCG. We also show results from a large-scale online A/B
experiment where this approach gave a statistically significant lift of 2.64%
in average revenue per order (RPO) (objective #1) with no drop in conversion
rate (CR) (objective #2) while holding the average last-mile traversed flat
(objective #3), vs. the baseline ranking method. This method also significantly
reduces time to model development and deployment in MO settings and allows for
trivial extensions to more objectives and other types of LTR models.

The scheme for generating these perturbations relies on the application of a

as to leave the heavier ions un-magnetized at the laser frequency. This helps
in the excitation of the LH waves. On the other hand at the slower time scale

Three-dimensional simulations of internal flows in evaporating droplets of
ethanol and silicone oil have been carried out. For describing the Marangoni
flows we find it necessary to account for the diffusion of vapor in air, the
thermal conduction in all three phases and thermal radiation. The equations
have been solved numerically by finite element method using ANSYS Fluent. As a
result of the simulations, the nonstationary behavior of B\'enard-Marangoni
(BM) instabilities is obtained. At the first stage, a flower structure of BM
cells near the triple line emerge. For smaller contact angles, the cells grow
in size and occupy the central region of the droplet surface. Being closely
connected with recent experimental and theoretical studies, the results
obtained help to analyze and resolve the associated issues.

Temperature distributions and vortex structures are obtained for droplets of

evaporating sessile drop, effects of the thermal conduction in the droplet and
substrate and diffusion of vapor in air have been jointly taken into account.
The equations have been solved by finite element method using ANSYS Fluent. The
phase diagrams demonstrating the number and orientation of the vortices as
functions of the contact angle and the ratio of substrate to fluid thermal
conductivities, are obtained and analyzed for various values of parameters. In
particular, influence of gravity on the droplet shape and the effect of droplet
size have been considered. We have found that the phase diagrams of highly
volatile droplets do not contain a subregion corresponding to a reversed single
vortex, and their single-vortex subregion becomes more complex. The phase
diagrams for droplets of larger size do not contian subregions corresponding to
a regular single vortex and to three vortices. We demonstrate how the
single-vortex subregion disappears with a gradual increase of the droplet size.

Bayesian models based on their estimated predictive performance on new, unseen,
data. As leave-one-out cross-validation is based on finite observed data, there
is uncertainty about the expected predictive performance on new data. By
modeling this uncertainty when comparing two models, we can compute the
probability that one model has a better predictive performance than the other.
Modeling this uncertainty well is not trivial, and for example, it is known
that the commonly used standard error estimate is often too small. We study the
properties of the Bayesian LOO-CV estimator and the related uncertainty
estimates when comparing two models. We provide new results of the properties
both theoretically in the linear regression case and empirically for multiple
different models and discuss the challenges of modeling the uncertainty. We
show that problematic cases include: comparing models with similar predictions,
misspecified models, and small data. In these cases, there is a weak connection
in the skewness of the individual leave-one-out terms and the distribution of
the error of the Bayesian LOO-CV estimator. We show that it is possible that
the problematic skewness of the error distribution, which occurs when the
models make similar predictions, does not fade away when the data size grows to
infinity in certain situations. Based on the results, we also provide practical
recommendations for the users of Bayesian LOO-CV for model comparison.

Infrared Galaxy (VIKING) survey. This exploits a new list-driven dataset
providing photometry in all bands ZYJHKs, for all sources detected by VIKING in
$J$. We use the Bayesian model comparison (BMC) selection method of Mortlock et
al., producing a ranked list of just 21 candidates. The sources ranked 1, 2, 3
and 5 are the four known $z>6.5$ quasars in this field. Additional observations
of the other 17 candidates, primarily DESI Legacy Survey photometry and ESO

sample from the VIKING survey, and we provide the computed selection function.
We include a detailed comparison of the BMC method against two other selection
methods: colour cuts and minimum-$\chi^2$ SED fitting. We find that: i) BMC
produces eight times fewer false positives than colour cuts, while also
reaching 0.3 mag. deeper, ii) the minimum-$\chi^2$ SED fitting method is
extremely efficient but reaches 0.7 mag. less deep than the BMC method, and
selects only one of the four known quasars. We show that BMC candidates,
rejected because their photometric SEDs have high $\chi^2$ values, include
bright examples of galaxies with very strong [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007

background. Since color labels are rare and costly to acquire, our method
leverages weakly supervised learning for conditional GANs. This enables to
learn a controllable synthesis of complex objects, and only requires a weak
proxy of the image attribute that we desire to modify. Finally, we present for
the first time a quantitative analysis of makeup style transfer and color
control performance.

theory, it becomes less obvious what the correct notion of invertibility is, as
extra coherence conditions can become necessary for invertible structures to

define three notions of invertibility inspired by homotopy type theory. These

bi-invertibility, where a separate left and right inverse is given, and
half-adjoint inverse, which is a quasi-inverse with an extra coherence

applications like self-driving cars, robot navigation, and mobile applications,

latency constraint formulation to trade-off between accuracy and latency in our
architecture search. Contrary to previous works, our latency loss guarantees
that the final network achieves latency under a specified target value. This is
crucial when the end task is to be deployed in a limited hardware setting.
Extensive experiments show that LC-NAS is able to find state-of-the-art

computational cost. We also show how our searched architectures achieve any
desired latency with a reasonably low drop in accuracy. Finally, we show how

friction, conditions for stability and instability of an equilibrium

experimental demonstration of this stability theory, using a variable-structure
rigid ''biped'' with frictional footpads on an inclined plane. By changing the
biped's center-of-mass location, we attain different equilibrium states, which
respond to small perturbations by divergence or convergence, showing remarkable
agreement with the predictions of the stability theory. Using high-speed
recording of video movies, good quantitative agreement between experiments and
numerical simulations is obtained, and limitations of the rigid-body model and
inelastic impact assumptions are also studied. The results prove the utility

Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) simulations and estimate the upper limits
on escape rates from the Earth's open field line bundle starting from three
gigayears ago (Ga) to present assuming the present-day composition of the
atmosphere. We perform two additional simulations with lower mixing ratios of
oxygen of 1% and 15% to account for the conditions shortly after the Great
Oxydation Event (GOE). We estimate the maximum loss rates due to polar outflow
three gigayears ago of $3.3 \times10^{27}$ s$^{-1}$ and $2.4 \times 10^{27}$
s$^{-1}$ for oxygen and nitrogen, respectively. The total integrated mass loss
equals to 39% and 10% of the modern atmosphere's mass, for oxygen and nitrogen,
respectively. According to our results, the main factors that governed the
polar outflow in the considered time period are the evolution of the XUV
radiation of the Sun and the atmosphere's composition. The evolution of the
Earth's magnetic field plays a less important role. We conclude that although
the atmosphere with the present-day composition can survive the escape due to
polar outflow, a higher level of CO$_2$ between 3.0 and 2.0~Ga is likely
necessary to reduce the escape.

main scattering mechanism in $p$-type PbTe, while scattering due to transverse
optical modes is the weakest. The L valleys contribute most to thermoelectric

short-packets has been proposed to fulfill the stringent requirements regarding
reliability and latency of emerging applications in 5G and beyond networks. In
addition, multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (MIMO
NOMA) is a potential candidate to improve the spectral efficiency, reliability,
latency, and connectivity of wireless systems. In this paper, we investigate
short-packet communications (SPC) in a multiuser downlink MIMO NOMA system over
Nakagami-m fading, and propose two antenna-user selection methods considering
two clusters of users having different priority levels. In contrast to the
widely-used long data-packet assumption, the SPC analysis requires the redesign
of the communication protocols and novel performance metrics. Given this
context, we analyze the SPC performance of MIMO NOMA systems using the average
block error rate (BLER) and minimum blocklength, instead of the conventional
metrics such as ergodic capacity and outage capacity. More specifically, to
characterize the system performance regarding SPC, asymptotic (in the high

average BLER at the users are derived. Based on the asymptotic behavior of the
average BLER, an analysis of the diversity order, minimum blocklength, and
optimal power allocation is carried out. The achieved results show that MIMO
NOMA can serve multiple users simultaneously using a smaller blocklength

abundant when $\sigma(n) - n > n$ and perfect when $\sigma(n) - n = n$. I
recently introduced the recursive divisor function $a(n)$, the recursive analog
of the divisor function. It measures the extent to which a number is highly
divisible into parts, such that the parts are highly divisible into subparts,
so on. Just as the divisor function motivates the abundant and perfect numbers,
the recursive divisor function motivates their recursive analogs, which I
introduce here. A number is recursively abundant, or ample, if $a(n) > n$ and
recursively perfect, or pristine, if $a(n) = n$. There are striking parallels
between abundant and perfect numbers and their recursive counterparts. The
product of two ample numbers is ample, and ample numbers are either abundant or
odd perfect numbers. Odd ample numbers exist but are rare, and I conjecture
that there are such numbers not divisible by the first $k$ primes -- which is
known to be true for the abundant numbers. There are infinitely many pristine
numbers, but that they cannot be odd, apart from 1. Pristine numbers are the
product of a power of two and odd prime solutions to certain Diophantine
equations, reminiscent of how perfect numbers are the product of a power of two
and a Mersenne prime. The parallels between these kinds of numbers hint at
deeper links between the divisor function and its recursive analog, worthy of
further investigation.

routes, each of which optimizes a different criterion. For instance, in the
context of vehicle routing, one route would minimize the total distance
traveled, while other routes would also consider the total travel time or the
total incurred cost, or combinations thereof. In general, providing such a set
of diverse routes is obtained by finding optimal routes with respect to
different sets of weights on the network edges. This can be simply achieved by
consecutively executing a standard shortest path algorithm. However, in the
case of a large number of weight sets, this may require an excessively large
number of executions of such an algorithm, thus incurring a prohibitively large
running time.
  We indicate that, quite often, the different edge weights reflect different
combinations of some ""raw"" performance metrics (e.g., delay, cost). In such
cases, there is an inherent dependency among the different weights of the same
edge. This may well result in some similarity among the shortest routes, each
of which being optimal with respect to a specific set of weights. In this
study, we aim to exploit such similarity in order to improve the performance of
the solution scheme.
  Specifically, we contemplate edge weights that are obtained through different
linear combinations of some (``raw'') edge performance metrics. We establish
and validate a novel algorithm that efficiently computes a shortest path for
each set of edge weights. We demonstrate that, under reasonable assumptions,
the algorithm significantly outperforms the standard approach. Similarly to the
standard approach, the algorithm iteratively searches for routes, one per set
of edge weights; however, instead of executing each iteration independently, it
reduces the average running time by skillfully sharing information among the
iterations.

the reduction of the total reaction cross section that would allow a large body

experimental problem in validating the LL equation has been to achieve
sufficiently strong fields for radiation reaction to be important without
quantum effects being prominent. Notwithstanding, here we provide a
quantitative experimental test of the LL equation by measuring the emission

  formation under social influence",,,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.MA nlin.AO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose an agent-based model of collective opinion formation to study the
wisdom of crowds under social influence. The opinion of an agent is a
continuous positive value, denoting its subjective answer to a factual
question. The wisdom of crowds states that the average of all opinions is close
to the truth, i.e. the correct answer. But if agents have the chance to adjust
their opinion in response to the opinions of others, this effect can be
destroyed. Our model investigates this scenario by evaluating two competing
effects: (i) agents tend to keep their own opinion (individual conviction
$\beta$), (ii) they tend to adjust their opinion if they have information about
the opinions of others (social influence $\alpha$). For the latter, two
different regimes (full information vs. aggregated information) are compared.
Our simulations show that social influence only in rare cases enhances the
wisdom of crowds. Most often, we find that agents converge to a collective
opinion that is even farther away from the true answer. So, under social
influence the wisdom of crowds can be systematically wrong.

solar local dynamo where all three effects were taken into account. The
simulations started with a snapshot of already saturated battery-seeded dynamo,
where two new series were developed: one with solely ambipolar diffusion and
another one also taking into account the Hall term in the generalized Ohm's
law. The simulations were then run for about 4 hours of solar time to reach the
stationary regime and improve the statistics. In parallel, a purely MHD dynamo
simulation was also run for the same amount of time. The simulations are
compared in a statistical way. The results show that, with the inclusion of the
ambipolar diffusion, the amplitudes of the incompressible perturbations related
to Alfven waves are reduced, and the Poynting flux is absorbed, with a
frequency dependence. The Hall effect causes the opposite action: significant
excess of incompressible perturbations is generated and an excess of the
Poynting flux is observed in the chromospheric layers. The model with ambipolar
diffusion shows, on average, sharper current sheets and slightly more abundant
fast magneto-acoustic shocks in the chromosphere. The model with the Hall
effect has higher temperatures at the lower chromosphere and stronger and more
vertical magnetic field concentrations all over the chromosphere. The study of
high-frequency waves reveals that significant power of incompressible
perturbations is associated with areas with intense and more vertical magnetic
fields and larger temperatures. We find a positive correlation between the
magnitude of the ambipolar heating and the temperature increase at the same

that the equations of motion can be irregular. After an analysis of the arising
constraints and the symplectic form, we introduce adjusted coordinates on the
phase space which uncover its internal structure and result in a trivial form
of the Hamiltonian evolution map. For illustration, the formalism is applied to
the example of massless scalar field on a two-dimensional spacetime lattice.

formation of a new state of matter, known as the quark gluon plasma. It is not
possible to observe directly the plasma, where quarks and gluons are not
confined into hadrons. All the available information comes from the particles
that reach the detectors after the strongly interacting matter hadronizes.
Among those particles, one that plays an important role is the charmonium
J/$\psi$ heavy meson, made of a $ c \bar c$ quark anti-quark pair. The fraction
of such particles produced in a heavy ion collision is related to the
dissociation level caused by the plasma. On the other hand, the dissociation of
$J/\Psi $ in the plasma is influenced by the temperature and the density of the
medium and also by the presence of magnetic fields, that are produced in non
central collisions. A very interesting tool to study stability of physical
systems is the configuration entropy (CE). In recent years many examples in
various kinds of physical systems appeared in the literature, where an increase
in the CE is associated with an increase in the instability of the system. In
this article we calculate the CE for charmonium quasistates inside a plasma
with a magnetic field background, in order to investigate how the instability,
corresponding in this case to the dissociation in the thermal medium, is
translated into the dependence of the CE on the field.

contributions. First, a nonparametric BSS method, which is relevant to the GSP

Identifiability conditions show that utilizing both graph structure and

plausible platform to carry out these experiments. We present an experimental
design aiming at these goals, inspired by Schm\""ole et al., Class. Quantum
Grav. 33, 125031 (2016). Gold spheres weighing on the order a milligram will be
positioned on large silicon nitride membranes, which are spaced at
submillimeter distances from each other. These mass-loaded membranes are
mechanical oscillators that vibrate at $\sim 2$ kHz frequencies in a drum mode.
They are operated and measured by coupling to microwave cavities. First, we
show that it is possible to measure the gravitational force between the
oscillators at deep cryogenic temperatures, where thermal mechanical noise is
strongly suppressed. We investigate the measurement of gravity when the
positions of the gravitating masses exhibit significant quantum fluctuations,
including preparation of the massive oscillators in the ground state, or in a
squeezed state. We also present a plausible scheme to realize an experiment
where the two oscillators are prepared in a two-mode squeezed motional quantum
state that exhibits nonlocal quantum correlations and gravity the same time.
Although the gravity is classical, the experiment will pave the way for testing
true quantum gravity in related experimental arrangements. In a
proof-of-principle experiment, we operate a 1.7 mm diameter Si$_3$N$_4$
membrane loaded by a 1.3 mg gold sphere. At 10 mK temperature, we observe the
drum mode with a quality factor above half a million at 1.7 kHz, showing strong
promise for the experiments. Following implementation of vibration isolation,
cryogenic positioning, and phase noise filtering, we foresee that realizing the
experiments is in reach by combining known pieces of current technology.

Only in the $U$ band the decline is constant in the same interval. At later

the increasing contribution of the interaction between SN ejecta with
circumstellar material (CSM). Although heavily contaminated by emission lines
of the host galaxy, the early spectral sequence (until 32 d) shows persistent
narrow emissions, indicative of slow unshocked CSM, and the emergence of broad
Balmer lines of hydrogen with P-Cygni profiles over a blue continuum, arising
from a fast expanding SN ejecta. From about 2 months to $\sim$1200 d, the
P-Cygni profiles are overcome by intermediate width emissions (FWHM $\sim 6000$
\kms), produced in the shocked region due to interaction. On the red wing a red
bump appears after 76 d, likely a signature of the onset of interaction of the
receding ejecta with the CSM. The presence of fast material both approaching
and then receding is suggestive that we are observing the SN along the axis of
a jet-like ejection in a cavity devoid of or uninterrupted by CSM in the

progress and in some cases even managed to surpass transform coding based
approaches that have been established and refined over many decades. However,
state-of-the-art solutions for deep image compression typically employ
autoencoders which map the input to a lower dimensional latent space and thus
irreversibly discard information already before quantization. Due to that, they
inherently limit the range of quality levels that can be covered. In contrast,
traditional approaches in image compression allow for a larger range of quality
levels. Interestingly, they employ an invertible transformation before
performing the quantization step which explicitly discards information.
Inspired by this, we propose a deep image compression method that is able to go
from low bit-rates to near lossless quality by leveraging normalizing flows to
learn a bijective mapping from the image space to a latent representation. In
addition to this, we demonstrate further advantages unique to our solution,
such as the ability to maintain constant quality results through re-encoding,
even when performed multiple times. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to explore the opportunities for leveraging normalizing flows for
lossy image compression.

State-of-the-art semantic segmentation algorithms are mostly based on dilated
Fully Convolutional Networks (dilatedFCN), which adopt dilated convolutions in
the backbone networks to extract high-resolution feature maps for achieving
high-performance segmentation performance. However, due to many convolution
operations are conducted on the high-resolution feature maps, such
dilatedFCN-based methods result in large computational complexity and memory
consumption. To balance the performance and efficiency, there also exist
encoder-decoder structures that gradually recover the spatial information by
combining multi-level feature maps from the encoder. However, the performances
of existing encoder-decoder methods are far from comparable with the
dilatedFCN-based methods. In this paper, we propose the EfficientFCN, whose
backbone is a common ImageNet pre-trained network without any dilated

high-resolution semantic-rich feature maps via the multi-scale features from
the encoder. The decoding task is converted to novel codebook generation and

a central role in the study of surfaces and mapping class groups?
  More specifically, we consider a surface $\Sigma$ of finite type and its
curve graph $\mathcal C(\Sigma)$, and we investigate its first-order theory in
the language of graph theory. Crucially, $\mathcal C(\Sigma)$ is
bi-interpretable with a certain object called the augmented Cayley graph of the
mapping class group of the surface. We use this bi-interpretation to prove that
the theory of the curve graph is $\omega$--stable, to compute its Morley rank,
and to show that it has quantifier elimination with respect to the class of
$\forall\exists$--formulae. We also show that many of the complexes which are
naturally associated to a surface are interpretable in $\mathcal C(\Sigma)$.
This shows that these complexes are all $\omega$--stable and admit certain a
priori bounds on their Morley ranks. We are able to use Morley ranks to prove
that various complexes are not bi--interpretable with the curve graph. As a
consequence of quantifier elimination, we show that algebraic intersection
number is not definable in the first order theory of the curve graph. Finally,
we prove that the curve graph of a surface enjoys a novel phenomenon that we
call interpretation rigidity. That is, if surfaces $\Sigma_1$ and $\Sigma_2$
admits curve graphs that are mutually interpretable, then $\Sigma_1$ and
$\Sigma_2$ are homeomorphic to each other. Along the way, numerous technical
results are obtained.

with the simple version of the model show the existence of a unique maximum for
the operating profit of the airport in terms of capacity. The position of this

behaviour with the average number of passenger per aircraft at the airport and
the predictability of the flight departure times. In addition, we also show

hydro-mechanical response of fibre-reinforced hydrogels is considered. Here,
the medium in question is considered to be a highly heterogeneous two-component
media composed of a connected fibre-scaffold with periodically distributed
inclusions of hydrogel. While the fibres are assumed to be elastic, the
hydromechanical response of hydrogel is modeled via \emph{Biot's
poroelasticity}. We show that the resulting mathematical problem admits a
unique weak solution and investigate the limit behavior (in the sense of
two-scale convergence) of the solutions with respect to a scale parameter,
characterizing the heterogeneity of the medium. Letting this scale parameter
tend to zero, we arrive at an effective model where the micro variations of the
pore pressure give rise to a micro stress correction at the macro scale.

  In this paper, we take a first look at Alerting Authorities (AA) in the US

communication. We study the domain namespace structure, DNSSEC penetration, and
web certificates. We introduce an integrative threat model to better understand
whether and how the online presence and services of AAs are harmed. As an
illustrative example, we investigate 1,388 Alerting Authorities. We observe
partial heightened security relative to the global Internet trends, yet find
cause for concern as about 78% of service providers fail to deploy measures of
trustworthy service provision. Our analysis shows two major shortcomings.
First, how the DNS ecosystem is leveraged: about 50% of organizations do not
own their dedicated domain names and are dependent on others, 55% opt for
unrestricted-use namespaces, which simplifies phishing, and less than 4% of
unique AA domain names are secured by DNSSEC, which can lead to DNS poisoning
and possibly to certificate misissuance. Second, how Web PKI certificates are
utilized: 15% of all hosts provide none or invalid certificates, thus cannot
cater to confidentiality and data integrity, 64% of the hosts provide domain
validation certification that lack any identity information, and shared
certificates have gained on popularity, which leads to fate-sharing and can be
a cause for instability.

structures in the density distribution of circumbinary disks. They are the
result of the tidal interaction of the non-axisymmetric gravitational forces of
the central binary with the surrounding disk and are most prominent in the
inner region, where the asymmetry is most pronounced.
  Aims. The goal of this study is to test the feasibility of reconstructing the
gas density distribution and quantifying properties of structures in the inner
regions of edge-on circumbinary disks using multiple molecular line
observations.
  Methods. The density distribution in circumbinary disks is calculated with
two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. Subsequently, molecular line emission
maps are generated with 3D radiative transfer simulations. Based on these, we
investigate the observability of characteristic circumbinary structures located
in the innermost region for spatially resolved and unresolved disks.
  Results. We find that it is possible to reconstruct the inner cavity,
accretion arms and density waves from spatially resolved multi-wavelength
molecular line observation of circumbinary disks seen edge-on. For the
spatially unresolved observation only an estimate for the density gradient in
the transition area from cavity to inner disk rim can be derived.

dictates the observed photoemission. In particular, we model the effect of
defects and localised strain, in accordance with the most common experimental
realisations, on the photon statistics of emitted light. Moreover, we
demonstrate that an optical cavity has a negative impact on the photon
statistics, suppressing the single-photon character of the emission by
diminishing the effect of spectral filtering on the emitted light. Our work
provides a theoretical framework revealing criteria necessary to facilitate
single-photon emission in two-dimensional materials and thus can guide future

Such integration allows one to train a NN embedded in the NS equations without
having the target (labeled training) data for the direct outputs from the NN;
instead, the NN is trained on the field data (quantities of interest), which
are the solutions for the NS equations. To demonstrate the performance of the
framework, a case study is formulated: the 2D lid-driven cavity with
non-constant velocity-dependent dynamic viscosity is considered. A NN is
trained to predict the dynamic viscosity from the velocity fields. The
performance of the physics-integrated ML is compared with classical ML
framework, when a NN is directly trained on the available data (fields of the
dynamic viscosity). Both frameworks showed similar accuracy; however, despite
its complexity and computational cost, the physics-integrated ML offers
principal advantages, namely: (i) the target outputs (labeled training data)
for a NN might be unknown and can be recovered using PDEs; (ii) it is not
necessary to extract and preprocess information (training targets) from big
data, instead it can be extracted by PDEs; (iii) there is no need to employ a
physics- or scale-separation assumptions to build a closure model. The
advantage (i) is demonstrated in this paper, while the advantages (ii) and
(iii) are the subjects for future work. Such integration of PDEs with ML opens
a door for a tighter data-knowledge connection, which may potentially influence
the further development of the physics-based modelling with ML for data-driven

coupled cluster theory. The algorithm only requires an asymptotic memory costs

'validation', where the statistical likelihood of a transit arising from a
false positive (FP), non-planetary scenario is calculated. For the large
majority of these validated planets calculations were performed using the vespa
algorithm (Morton et al. 2016). Regardless of the strengths and weaknesses of
vespa, it is highly desirable for the catalogue of known planets not to be
dependent on a single method. We demonstrate the use of machine learning
algorithms, specifically a gaussian process classifier (GPC) reinforced by
other models, to perform probabilistic planet validation incorporating prior
probabilities for possible FP scenarios. The GPC can attain a mean log-loss per
sample of 0.54 when separating confirmed planets from FPs in the Kepler
threshold crossing event (TCE) catalogue. Our models can validate thousands of
unseen candidates in seconds once applicable vetting metrics are calculated,
and can be adapted to work with the active TESS mission, where the large number
of observed targets necessitates the use of automated algorithms. We discuss
the limitations and caveats of this methodology, and after accounting for
possible failure modes newly validate 50 Kepler candidates as planets, sanity
checking the validations by confirming them with vespa using up to date stellar
information. Concerning discrepancies with vespa arise for many other
candidates, which typically resolve in favour of our models. Given such issues,
we caution against using single-method planet validation with either method
until the discrepancies are fully understood.

associated with Linear Canonical Transformations (LCTs) which could play
important roles in physics. LCTs are considered in many fields. In quantum
theory, they can be identified with linear transformations which keep invariant
the Canonical Commutation Relations (CCRs). In this work, LCTs corresponding to
a general pseudo-Euclidian space are considered and related to a phase space
representation of quantum theory. Explicit calculations are firstly performed
for the monodimensional case to identify the corresponding LCT-invariant
quadratic operators then multidimensional generalizations of the obtained
results are deduced. The eigenstates of these operators are also identified. A
first kind of LCT-invariant operator is a second order polynomial of the
coordinates and momenta operators and is a generalization of reduced momentum
dispersion operator. The coefficients of this polynomial depend on the mean
values and the statistical variances-covariances of the coordinates and momenta
operators themselves. It is shown that these statistical variances-covariances
can be related with thermodynamic variables. Two other LCT-invariant quadratic
operators, which can be considered as the number operators of some
quasipartciles, are also identified: the first one is a number operator of
bosonic type quasiparticles and the second one corresponds to fermionic type.
This fermionic LCT-invariant quadratic operator is directly related to a spin
representation of LCTs. It is shown explicitly, in the case of a
pentadimensional theory, that the eigenstates of this operator can be
considered as basic quantum states of elementary fermions. A classification of
the fundamental fermions, compatible with the Standard model of particle
physics, is established from a classification of these states.

the eigenvalues (known as spectral radius) of the truncated matrix. Some
limiting distributions for the spectral radius for the truncated circular

is bounded away from $0$ and $1$; (2). $p_n\to\infty$ and $p_n/n\to 0$ as
$n\to\infty$; (3). $(n-p_n)/n\to 0$ and $(n-p_n)/(\log n)^3\to\infty$ as

vertexing and tracking at midrapidity. Thanks to this detector, remarkable
results were obtained with Run 2 data in all collision systems studied at the
LHC. In this contribution, the role of the ITS in the event, track and
secondary vertex reconstruction is highlighted, and the comparison of the
resolution on the track impact parameter to the collision point in data and
Monte Carlo simulations is reported. Finally, some of the main physics results
obtained in pp and Pb--Pb collisions relying on the excellent ALICE vertexing
and tracking capabilities are presented.

  offshore structures","Submitted to an international journal for peer review",,,,"math.NA cs.NA physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In marine offshore engineering, cost-efficient simulation of unsteady water
waves and their nonlinear interaction with bodies are important to address a
broad range of engineering applications at increasing fidelity and scale. We
consider a fully nonlinear potential flow (FNPF) model discretized using a
Galerkin spectral element method to serve as a basis for handling both wave
propagation and wave-body interaction with high computational efficiency within
a single modellingapproach. We design and propose an efficientO(n)-scalable
computational procedure based on geometric p-multigrid for solving the Laplace
problem in the numerical scheme. The fluid volume and the geometric features of
complex bodies is represented accurately using high-order polynomial basis
functions and unstructured meshes with curvilinear prism elements. The new
p-multigrid spectralelement model can take advantage of the high-order
polynomial basis and thereby avoid generating a hierarchy of geometric meshes
with changing number of elements as required in geometric h-multigrid
approaches. We provide numerical benchmarks for the algorithmic and numerical
efficiency of the iterative geometric p-multigrid solver. Results of numerical
experiments are presented for wave propagation and for wave-body interaction in
an advanced case for focusing design waves interacting with a FPSO. Our study
shows, that the use of iterative geometric p-multigrid methods for theLaplace
problem can significantly improve run-time efficiency of FNPF simulators.

(RNN) with variational inference (VI)-based dropout regularization employed for
the long short-term memory (LSTM) cells to more advanced RNN architectures like
gated recurrent unit (GRU) and bi-directional LSTM/GRU. The new variational
RNNs are employed for slot filling, which is an intriguing but challenging task
in spoken language understanding. The experiments on the ATIS dataset suggest
that the variational RNNs with the VI-based dropout regularization can
significantly improve the naive dropout regularization RNNs-based baseline
systems in terms of F-measure. Particularly, the variational RNN with
bi-directional LSTM/GRU obtains the best F-measure score.

company's financial performance with analysts and investors. Information
disclosed during an earnings call is an essential source of data for analysts
and investors to make investment decisions. Thus, we leverage earnings call
transcripts to predict future stock price dynamics. We propose to model the
language in transcripts using a deep learning framework, where an attention
mechanism is applied to encode the text data into vectors for the
discriminative network classifier to predict stock price movements. Our
empirical experiments show that the proposed model is superior to the
traditional machine learning baselines and earnings call information can boost
the stock price prediction performance.

have to be left to speculation. If life in general requires stars as its
primary energy source and uses elemental building blocks heavier than those

the universe was considerably less than 0.1 billion years old. At that time,
heavy element producing hypernovae exploded at corresponding redshifts.}

However, it cannot automatically choose the dimensionality of data. In this
paper, we develop a Bayesian geodesic regression model on Riemannian manifolds

control the effectiveness of the model. To automatically select the
dimensionality, we develop a prior for the geodesic regression model, which can
automatically select the number of relevant dimensions by driving unnecessary
tangent vectors to zero. To show the validation of our model, we first apply it
in the 3D synthetic sphere and 2D pentagon data. We then demonstrate the
effectiveness of our model in reducing the dimensionality and analyzing shape
