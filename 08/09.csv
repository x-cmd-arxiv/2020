of individuals and organizations on the Internet and their concern about the
security and privacy of their online activities. Several previous machine
learning (ML)-based network intrusion detection systems (NIDSs) have been
developed to protect against malicious online behavior. This paper proposes a
novel multi-stage optimized ML-based NIDS framework that reduces computational
complexity while maintaining its detection performance. This work studies the
impact of oversampling techniques on the models' training sample size and
determines the minimal suitable training sample size. Furthermore, it compares
between two feature selection techniques, information gain and
correlation-based, and explores their effect on detection performance and time
complexity. Moreover, different ML hyper-parameter optimization techniques are
investigated to enhance the NIDS's performance. The performance of the proposed
framework is evaluated using two recent intrusion detection datasets, the
CICIDS 2017 and the UNSW-NB 2015 datasets. Experimental results show that the
proposed model significantly reduces the required training sample size (up to
74%) and feature set size (up to 50%). Moreover, the model performance is
enhanced with hyper-parameter optimization with detection accuracies over 99%
for both datasets, outperforming recent literature works by 1-2% higher
accuracy and 1-2% lower false alarm rate.

  The design exploits three opportunities. One is associated with visible

freedom made possible by the user's anticipated focus of attention during
certain interactions. A third opportunity to provide valuable functionality
arises from wearable sensors and machine learning algorithms. The resulting
interface permits ``What if?'' questions: it allows a user to dynamically and
manually explore predicted short-term (e.g., 2 hours) relationships between an
intended meal, blood glucose level and recommended insulin dosage, and thereby
readily make informed food and exercise decisions. Design activity has been
informed throughout by focus groups comprising people with Type 1 diabetes in
addition to experts in diabetes, interaction design and machine learning. The

regression approaches accommodating spatial and non-spatial effects in big
data. Regression model selection is particularly important to stably estimate
flexible regression models. However, conventional methods can be slow for large
samples. Hence, we develop a fast and practical model-selection approach for
spatial regression models, focusing on the selection of coefficient types that
include constant, spatially varying, and non-spatially varying coefficients. A
pre-processing approach, which replaces data matrices with small inner products
through dimension reduction dramatically accelerates the computation speed of
model selection. Numerical experiments show that our approach selects the model
accurately and computationally efficiently, highlighting the importance of
model selection in the spatial regression context. Then, the present approach
is applied to open data to investigate local factors affecting crime in Japan.
The results suggest that our approach is useful not only for selecting factors
influencing crime risk but also for predicting crime events. This scalable
model selection will be key to appropriately specifying flexible and
large-scale spatial regression models in the era of big data. The developed
model selection approach was implemented in the R package spmoran.

the framework of the density functional theory, we predict that the
non-magnetic phase is very close to a 3D collinear ferrimagnetic state, which
realizes in the regime of moderate correlations, such tendency being common to
all the members of the family with very small variations due to the different
interchain ferromagnetic coupling. We uncover that the stability of such
interchain ferromagnetic coupling has a non-monotonic behavior with increasing
the cation size, being critically related to the degree of structural
distortions which is parametrized by the Cr-As-Cr bonding angles along the
chain direction. In particular, we demonstrate that it is boosted in the case
of the Rb, in agreement with recent experiments. We also show that uniaxial
strain is a viable tool to tune the non-magnetic phase towards an interchain
ferromagnetic instability. The modifcation of the shape of the Cr triangles
within the unit cell favors the formation of a net magnetization within the

bacteria as they secrete certain molecules into the intercellular medium that

on cell density, this uptake has the potential to alter gene expression and
thereby affect global properties of the community. We consider the case of
multiple bacterial species coexisting, referring to each one of them as a
genotype and adopting the usual denomination of the molecules they collectively
secrete as public goods. A crucial problem in this setting is characterizing
the coevolution of genotypes as some of them secrete public goods (and pay the
associated metabolic costs) while others do not but may nevertheless benefit
from the available public goods. We introduce a network model to describe
genotype interaction and evolution when genotype fitness depends on the
production and uptake of public goods. The model comprises a random graph to
summarize the possible evolutionary pathways the genotypes may take as they
interact genetically with one another, and a system of coupled differential
equations to characterize the behavior of genotype abundance in time. We study
some simple variations of the model analytically and more complex variations
computationally. Our results point to a simple trade-off affecting the
long-term survival of those genotypes that do produce public goods. This
trade-off involves, on the producer side, the impact of producing and that of
absorbing the public good. On the non-producer side, it involves the impact of
absorbing the public good as well, now compounded by the molecular
compatibility between the producer and the non-producer. Depending on how these
factors turn out, producers may or may not survive.

approximation settings is challenging: does the projected Bellman equation have
a solution? If so, is the solution useful in the sense of generating a good
policy? And, if the preceding questions are answered in the affirmative, is the
algorithm consistent? These questions are unanswered even in the special case
of Q-function approximations that are linear in the parameter. The challenge
seems paradoxical, given the long history of convex analytic approaches to
dynamic programming. The paper begins with a brief survey of linear programming
approaches to optimal control, leading to a particular over parameterization
that lends itself to applications in reinforcement learning. The main
conclusions are summarized as follows:
  (i) The new class of convex Q-learning algorithms is introduced based on the
convex relaxation of the Bellman equation. Convergence is established under
general conditions, including a linear function approximation for the
Q-function.
  (ii) A batch implementation appears similar to the famed DQN algorithm (one
engine behind AlphaZero). It is shown that in fact the algorithms are very
different: while convex Q-learning solves a convex program that approximates
the Bellman equation, theory for DQN is no stronger than for Watkins' algorithm
with function approximation: (a) it is shown that both seek solutions to the
same fixed point equation, and (b) the ODE approximations for the two
algorithms coincide, and little is known about the stability of this ODE.
  These results are obtained for deterministic nonlinear systems with total
cost criterion. Many extensions are proposed, including kernel implementation,
and extension to MDP models.

originates from a dynamical wormhole, its throat is the seed of Einstein Static

universe is presented. A new shape function for closed universe is determined.
The non-linear equation of state (EoS) corresponds to three types of cosmic
fluids. The EoS parameters determine the cosmic fluids. The space-time
dimensions determines the rate of change of a particular fluid that varies with
the scale factor of a dynamically evolving universe with non-interacting
fluids. Considering interaction at time $t > t_0$, among the three types of
fluids it is possible to describe the observed universe satisfactorily. In a
higher dimensional universe it is found that near the throat null energy
condition (NEC) is violated, but away from the throat NEC is found to obey
admitting the observed universe for a flat case. Another interesting aspect of
the EU model is that it permits late accelerating phase. However, in asymptotic
closed or open universe, flat emergent universe can be accommodated with NEC
which is obeyed right from the throat to the present epoch. The tension at the
throat of the wormhole is estimated which is found to depend on the initial
size of the Einstein static universe and dimensions of the universe. It is
interesting to note that NEC is not violated to accommodate dynamical wormholes
for closed or open universe. Although exotic matter is required at the throat
for the flat universe, no exotic matter is required for closed or open universe

$O(N)$, unless it is given additional information about the agents' values.

prediction of her monopolist utility, i.e., her utility if all goods were given

the multiplicative errors in these predictions. The algorithm achieves a
competitive ratio of $O(\log N)$ and $O(\log T)$ if the predictions are

errors in the predictions, and is surprisingly robust: the logarithmic
competitive ratio holds even if the predictions are very inaccurate. We
complement this positive result by showing that our bounds are essentially
tight: no online algorithm, even if provided with perfectly accurate

fabricated by FIB and were deformed inside a scanning electron microscope at

was performed to analyse crack growth and determine the fracture toughness. At
all three temperatures the plastic zone was found to be larger close to the
free surface than inside the specimen, similar to macro-scale tension tests.
However, at higher temperature, the 3D shape of the plastic zone changes from
being localized in front of the crack tip to a butterfly-like distribution,
shielding more efficiently the crack tip and inhibiting crack propagation. A
comparison was made between two identically deformed samples, which were
FIB-sliced from two different directions, to evaluate the reliability of the
GND density estimation by HR-EBSD. The analysis of the distribution of the Nye
tensor components was used to differentiate between the types of GNDs nucleated

A digraph analogue of chordal graphs was introduced by Haskin and Rose in 1973
but has not been a subject of active studies until recently when a
characterization of semicomplete chordal digraphs in terms of forbidden
subdigraphs was found by Meister and Telle. Locally semicomplete digraphs,
quasi-transitive digraphs, and extended semi-complete digraphs are amongst the
most popular generalizations of semicomplete digraphs. We extend the forbidden
subdigraph characterization of semicomplete chordal digraphs to locally
semicomplete chordal digraphs. We introduce a new class of digraphs, called
weakly quasi-transitive digraphs, which contains quasi-transitive digraphs,
symmetric digraphs, and extended semicomplete digraphs, but is incomparable to
the class of locally semicomplete digraphs. We show that weakly
quasi-transitive digraphs can be recursively constructed by simple
substitutions from transitive oriented graphs, semicomplete digraphs, and
symmetric digraphs. This recursive construction of weakly quasi-transitive
digraphs, similar to the one for quasi-transitive digraphs, demonstrates the
naturalness of the new digraph class. As a by-product, we prove that the
forbidden subdigraphs for semicomplete chordal digraphs are the same for weakly
quasi-transitive chordal digraphs.

a measurement outcome, thus poses no paradox for QBism. Indeed the resolution
of Wigner's original thought experiment was central to the development of QBist
thinking. The focus of this paper concerns two very instructive modifications
to Wigner's puzzle: One, a recent no-go theorem by Frauchiger and Renner, and
the other a thought experiment by Baumann and Brukner. We show that the
paradoxical features emphasized in these works disappear once both friend and
Wigner are understood as agents on an equal footing with regard to their
individual uses of quantum theory. Wigner's action on his friend then becomes,
from the friend's perspective, an action the friend takes on Wigner. Our
analysis rests on a kind of quantum Copernican principle: When two agents take
actions on each other, each agent has a dual role as a physical system for the
other agent. No user of quantum theory is more privileged than any other. In

shared memory accesses in a parallel program. Traditionally, instruction set
architecture (ISA) MCMs assume that relevant program-visible memory ordering
behaviors only result from shared memory interactions that take place between
user-level program instructions. This assumption fails to account for virtual
memory (VM) implementations that may result in additional shared memory
interactions between user-level program instructions and both 1) system-level
operations (e.g., address remappings and translation lookaside buffer
invalidations initiated by system calls) and 2) hardware-level operations
(e.g., hardware page table walks and dirty bit updates) during a user-level
program's execution. These additional shared memory interactions can impact the
observable memory ordering behaviors of user-level programs. Thus, memory
transistency models (MTMs) have been coined as a superset of MCMs to
additionally articulate VM-aware consistency rules. However, no prior work has
enabled formal MTM specifications, nor methods to support their automated
analysis.
  To fill the above gap, this paper presents the TransForm framework. First,
TransForm features an axiomatic vocabulary for formally specifying MTMs.
Second, TransForm includes a synthesis engine to support the automated
generation of litmus tests enhanced with MTM features (i.e., enhanced litmus
tests, or ELTs) when supplied with a TransForm MTM specification. As a case
study, we formally define an estimated MTM for Intel x86 processors, called
x86t_elt, that is based on observations made by an ELT-based evaluation of an
Intel x86 MTM implementation from prior work and available public
documentation. Given x86t_elt and a synthesis bound as input, TransForm's

powerful deep models to obtain better deraining results. In this paper, to
further improve the deraining performance, we novelly attempt to handle the
SIRR task from the perspective of training datasets by exploring a more
efficient way to synthesize rainy images. Specifically, we build a full
Bayesian generative model for rainy image where the rain layer is parameterized
as a generator with the input as some latent variables representing the
physical structural rain factors, e.g., direction, scale, and thickness. To
solve this model, we employ the variational inference framework to approximate
the expected statistical distribution of rainy image in a data-driven manner.
With the learned generator, we can automatically and sufficiently generate
diverse and non-repetitive training pairs so as to efficiently enrich and
augment the existing benchmark datasets. User study qualitatively and
quantitatively evaluates the realism of generated rainy images. Comprehensive
experiments substantiate that the proposed model can faithfully extract the
complex rain distribution that not only helps significantly improve the
deraining performance of current deep single image derainers, but also largely
loosens the requirement of large training sample pre-collection for the SIRR
task.

success. However, in addition to crash bugs, non-crashing functional bugs (in
short as ""non-crashing bugs"" in this work) like inadvertent function failures,
silent user data lost and incorrect display information are prevalent, even in
popular, well-tested apps. These non-crashing functional bugs are usually
caused by program logic errors and manifest themselves on the graphic user
interfaces (GUIs). In practice, such bugs pose significant challenges in
effectively detecting them because (1) current practices heavily rely on
expensive, small-scale manual validation (the lack of automation); and (2)
modern fully automated testing has been limited to crash bugs (the lack of test
oracles). This paper fills this gap by introducing independent view fuzzing, a
novel, fully automated approach for detecting non-crashing functional bugs in
Android apps. Inspired by metamorphic testing, our key insight is to leverage
the commonly-held independent view property of Android apps to manufacture
property-preserving mutant tests from a set of seed tests that validate certain
app properties. The mutated tests help exercise the tested apps under
additional, adverse conditions. Any property violations indicate likely
functional bugs for further manual confirmation. We have realized our approach
as an automated, end-to-end functional fuzzing tool, Genie. Given an app, (1)
Genie automatically detects non-crashing bugs without requiring human-provided
tests and oracles (thus fully automated); and (2) the detected non-crashing
bugs are diverse (thus general and not limited to specific functional
properties), which set Genie apart from prior work.

their path if multiple options are available. The zombie number, like the cop
number, of a graph is the minimum number of zombies, or cops, required to
capture the survivor. In this short note, we solve a question by Fitzpatrick et
al., proving that the zombie number of the Cartesian product of two graphs is
at most the sum of their zombie numbers. We also give a simple graph family
with cop number $2$ and an arbitrarily large zombie number.

further optimizing the chemical compositions of these alloys to achieve a

challenging, which would require systematic predictions of the correlated alloy
properties across a vast compositional space. In the present work, we performed
first-principles calculations with the special quasi-random structure (SQS)
method to predict the unstable stacking fault energy ($\gamma_{usf}$) of the
$(1\bar10)[111]$ slip system and the $(1\bar10)$-plane surface energy

solid-solution alloys with constituent elements among Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta,

statistical regression to accurately and efficiently predict $\gamma_{usf}$ and
$\gamma_{surf}$ for refractory multicomponent alloys in the 10-element

models show outstanding predictive ability in the high-order multicomponent
systems. The ratio between $\gamma_{surf}$ and $\gamma_{usf}$ is a parameter to
reflect the potency of intrinsic ductility of an alloy based on the Rice model
of crack-tip deformation. Therefore, using the surrogate models, we performed a

integrity. Android utilizes a combination of mandatory (e.g., SEAndroid) and
discretionary (e.g., UNIX permissions) access control, both to protect the
Android platform from Android/OEM services and to protect Android/OEM services
from third-party apps. However, OEMs often create vulnerabilities when they
introduce market-differentiating features because they err when re-configuring
this complex combination of Android policies. In this paper, we propose the
PolyScope tool to triage the combination of Android filesystem access control
policies to vet releases for vulnerabilities. The PolyScope approach leverages
two main insights: (1) adversaries may exploit the coarse granularity of
mandatory policies and the flexibility of discretionary policies to increase
the permissions available to launch attacks, which we call permission
expansion, and (2) system configurations may limit the ways adversaries may use
their permissions to launch attacks, motivating computation of attack
operations. We apply PolyScope to three Google and five OEM Android releases to
compute the attack operations accurately to vet these releases for
vulnerabilities, finding that permission expansion increases the permissions
available to launch attacks, sometimes by more than 10X, but a significant
fraction of these permissions (about 15-20%) are not convertible into attack
operations. Using PolyScope, we find two previously unknown vulnerabilities,
showing how PolyScope helps OEMs triage the complex combination of access
control policies down to attack operations worthy of testing.

the physical and dynamical properties of those that survive in the system's
Habitable Zone (HZ). This study is based on a comparative study between N-body
simulations that include fragmentation and others that consider all collisions
as perfect mergers. We use an N-body code, presented in a previous paper, that
allows planetary fragmentation. We carry out three sets of 24 simulations for
400 Myr. Two sets are developed adopting a model that includes hit-and-run
collisions and planetary fragmentation, each one with different values of the
individual minimum mass allowed for the fragments. For the third set, we
considered that all collisions lead to perfect mergers. The systems produced in
N-body simulations with and without fragmentation are broadly similar, with
some differences. In runs with fragmentation, the formed planets have lower
masses since part it is distributed amongst collisional fragments.
Additionally, those planets presented lower eccentricities, presumably due to
dynamical friction with the generated fragments. Perfect mergers and
hit-and-run collisions are the most common outcome. Regardless of the
collisional treatment adopted, most of the planets that survive in the HZ start
the simulation beyond the snow line, having very high final water contents. The
fragments' contribution to their mass and water content is negligible. Finally,
the individual minimum mass for fragments may play an important role in the
planets' collisional history. Collisional models that incorporate fragmentation
and hit-and-run collisions lead to a more detailed description of the physical
properties of the terrestrial-like planets formed. We conclude that planetary
fragmentation is not a barrier to the formation of water worlds in the HZ.

support points to define the GPS. Together with an introduced optimization
scheme for the hyperparameters of the model characterizing the weighting of
modelled correlation features, this makes it possible to easily extract
physical characteristics of the state such as the relative importance of
particular correlation properties. We apply the Bayesian learning scheme to the
problem of modelling ground states of small Fermi-Hubbard chains and show that
the found solutions represent a systematically improvable trade-off between
sparsity and accuracy of the model. Moreover, we show how the learned
hyperparameters and the extracted relevant configurations, characterizing the
correlation of the wavefunction, depend on the interaction strength of the

multiplexing several DNNs on the GPU and can improve GPU utilization, thus
improving throughput and lowering latency. DNN models given just the right
amount of GPU resources can still provide low inference latency, just as much
as dedicating all of the GPU for their inference task. An approach to improve
DNN inference is tuning of the DNN model. Autotuning frameworks find the
optimal low-level implementation for a certain target device based on the
trained machine learning model, thus reducing the DNN's inference latency and
increasing inference throughput. We observe an interdependency between the
tuned model and its inference latency. A DNN model tuned with specific GPU
resources provides the best inference latency when inferred with close to the
same amount of GPU resources. While a model tuned with the maximum amount of
the GPU's resources has poorer inference latency once the GPU resources are
limited for inference. On the other hand, a model tuned with an appropriate
amount of GPU resources still achieves good inference latency across a wide
range of GPU resource availability. We explore the causes that impact the
tuning of a model at different amounts of GPU resources. We present many
techniques to maximize resource utilization and improve tuning performance. We
enable controlled spatial sharing of GPU to multiplex several tuning
applications on the GPU. We scale the tuning server instances and shard the
tuning model across multiple client instances for concurrent tuning of
different operators of a model, achieving better GPU multiplexing. With our
improvements, we decrease DNN autotuning time by up to 75 percent and increase

are the kinematics of older stars at the same metallicities. We do not measure

These findings show that the bulge experienced an initial starburst that was
more intense close to the plane than far from the plane. Then, star formation
continued at super-solar metallicities in a thin disk at 2 kpc $\lesssim R_{\rm

heterogeneity of the data across different clients which gives rise to the
client drift phenomenon. In fact, obtaining an algorithm for FL which is
uniformly better than simple centralized training has been a major open problem
thus far. In this work, we propose a general algorithmic framework, Mime, which
i) mitigates client drift and ii) adapts arbitrary centralized optimization
algorithms such as momentum and Adam to the cross-device federated learning
setting. Mime uses a combination of control-variates and server-level
statistics (e.g. momentum) at every client-update step to ensure that each
local update mimics that of the centralized method run on iid data. We prove a
reduction result showing that Mime can translate the convergence of a generic
algorithm in the centralized setting into convergence in the federated setting.
Further, we show that when combined with momentum based variance reduction,
Mime is provably faster than any centralized method--the first such result. We
also perform a thorough experimental exploration of Mime's performance on real
world datasets.

and ionized species in dissipating the ordered energy of intermediate-mode MHD
waves into heat. We solve conservation equations for the hydrodynamics and for
hydrogen and helium ionization stages, along closed tubes of magnetic field.
First, we examine the evolution of coronal plasma under conditions where
coronal heating has abruptly ceased. We find that cool ($< 10^5$K) structures
are formed lasting for several hours. MHD waves of modest amplitude can heat
the plasma through ion-neutral collisions with sufficient energy rates to
support the plasma against gravity. Then we examine a calculation starting from
a cooler atmosphere. The calculation shows that warm ($> 10^4 $) K long ($>$
several Mm) tubes of plasma arise by the same mechanism. We speculate on the
relevance of these solutions to observed properties of the Sun and similar
stars whose atmospheres are permeated with emerging magnetic fields and stirred
by convection. Perhaps this elementary process might help explain the presence
of ``cool loops'' in the solar transition region and the production of broad
components of transition region lines. The production of ionized hydrogen from
such a simple and perhaps inevitable mechanism may be an important step towards
finding the more complex mechanisms needed to generate coronae with
temperatures in excess of 10$^6$K, independent of a star's metallicity.

the condition of the cardiovascular system. Deep neural networks (DNNs), have
been developed in many research labs for automatic interpretation of ECG
signals to identify potential abnormalities in patient hearts. Studies have
shown that given a sufficiently large amount of data, the classification
accuracy of DNNs could reach human-expert cardiologist level. However, despite
of the excellent performance in classification accuracy, it has been shown that
DNNs are highly vulnerable to adversarial noises which are subtle changes in
input of a DNN and lead to a wrong class-label prediction with a high
confidence. Thus, it is challenging and essential to improve robustness of DNNs
against adversarial noises for ECG signal classification, a life-critical
application. In this work, we designed a CNN for classification of 12-lead ECG
signals with variable length, and we applied three defense methods to improve
robustness of this CNN for this classification task. The ECG data in this study
is very challenging because the sample size is limited, and the length of each
ECG recording varies in a large range. The evaluation results show that our
customized CNN reached satisfying F1 score and average accuracy, comparable to
the top-6 entries in the CPSC2018 ECG classification challenge, and the defense
methods enhanced robustness of our CNN against adversarial noises and white
noises, with a minimal reduction in accuracy on clean data.

2728.01 & 3320.01 are exomoon candidates, based on an analysis of their transit
timing. Here, we perform an independent investigation, which is framed in terms
of three questions: 1) Are there significant excess TTVs? 2) Is there a
significant periodic TTV? 3) Is there evidence for a non-zero moon mass? We
applied rigorous statistical methods to these questions alongside a re-analysis
of the Kepler photometry and find that none of the KOIs satisfy these three
tests. Specifically, KOIs-268.01 & 3220.01 pass none of the tests and
KOIs-303.01, 1888.01 & 1925.01 pass a single test each. Only KOI-2728.01
satisfies two, but fails the cross-validation test for predictions. Further,
detailed photodynamical modeling reveals that KOI-2728.01 favours a negative
radius moon (as does KOI-268.01). We also note that we find a significant
photoeccentric for KOI-1925.01 indicating an eccentric orbit of
e>(0.62+/-0.06). For comparison, we applied the same tests to Kepler-1625b,

epochs. In conclusion, we find no compelling evidence for exomoons amongst the
six KOIs. Despite this, we're able to derive exomoon mass upper limits versus
semi-major axis, with KOI-3220.01 leading to particularly impressive
constraints of Ms/Mp < 0.4% [2 sigma] at a similar relative semi-major to that

an unsupervised manner using both out-of-domain (LibriSpeech, VoxCeleb) and
in-domain (DeepMine) unlabeled datasets to learn generic, high-level feature
representation that encapsulates speaker and phonetic content. Two
task-specific decoders were trained using labeled datasets to classify speakers
(SID) and phrases (PID). Speaker embeddings extracted from the SID decoder were
scored using a PLDA. SID and PID systems were fused at the score level. There
is a 51.9% relative improvement in minDCF for our system compared to the fully
supervised x-vector baseline on the cross-lingual DeepMine dataset. However,
the i-vector/HMM method outperformed the proposed APC encoder-decoder system. A
fusion of the x-vector/PLDA baseline and the SID/PLDA scores prior to PID
fusion further improved performance by 15% indicating complementarity of the
proposed approach to the x-vector system. We show that the proposed approach
can leverage from large, unlabeled, data-rich domains, and learn speech
patterns independent of downstream tasks. Such a system can provide competitive
performance in domain-mismatched scenarios where test data is from data-scarce
domains.

it is necessary to identify and patch vulnerabilities that may be maliciously

involving FTP-specific keywords sent to the UAV's FTP port in the form of a
fuzzing test and launching thousands of packets at other ports on the UAV as
well. During these tests, virtual and physical systems are monitored
extensively to identify specific patterns and vulnerabilities. This model is
applied to a Parrot Bebop 2, which accurately portrays a UAV that had their
network compromised by an attacker and portrays many lower-end UAV models for

difference between $\Lambda$ and K valleys is reduced by magnetic field, and
thus enhancing the corresponding indirect-transition trions. Meanwhile, the

explicit physical models for building thermal dynamics, which often require
significant effort to develop and are difficult to achieve sufficient accuracy
and efficiency for runtime building control and scalability for field
implementations. Recently, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a
promising data-driven method that provides good control performance without
analyzing physical models at runtime. However, a major challenge to DRL (and
many other data-driven learning methods) is the long training time it takes to
reach the desired performance. In this work, we present a novel transfer
learning based approach to overcome this challenge. Our approach can
effectively transfer a DRL-based HVAC controller trained for the source
building to a controller for the target building with minimal effort and
improved performance, by decomposing the design of neural network controller
into a transferable front-end network that captures building-agnostic behavior
and a back-end network that can be efficiently trained for each specific
building. We conducted experiments on a variety of transfer scenarios between
buildings with different sizes, numbers of thermal zones, materials and
layouts, air conditioner types, and ambient weather conditions. The
experimental results demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in
significantly reducing the training time, energy cost, and temperature

a superionic ($\beta$) state occurring in type-II fast-ion conductors (e.g.,
CaF$_{2}$ and Li-based superionic materials) cannot be regarded as a phase
transition in a rigorous thermodynamic sense. Fedorov's arguments for such a
criticism can be summarized as follows: (1) the available heat capacity data
for the $\alpha \to \beta$ transformation do not reproduce the expected
behaviour for a thermodynamic phase transition, (2) there is not evidence for
molar volume discontinuity during the superionic $\alpha \to \beta$
transformation, and (3) the $\alpha \to \beta$ transformation is symmetry
preserving. Here, we demonstrate either by reproducing experimental data
published by other authors or by explaining some simple solid-state arguments
that the statements put forward by Fedorov are incorrect and do not correspond
to reality. In fact, based on mounting experimental evidence, the normal to
superionic phase transformation occurring in type-II fast-ion conductors can be
rigorously considered, and should be referred to, as a phase transition.
Notwithstanding, it remains less obvious to establish with generality which is
the order of the $\alpha \to \beta$ phase transition.

given an input video. It has become more and more important for various
research and industry areas, such as cell tracking for biomedical research and
human tracking in video surveillance. Most existing algorithms depend on the
uniqueness of the object's appearance, and the dominating bipartite matching
scheme ignores the speed smoothness. Although several methods have incorporated
the velocity smoothness for tracking, they either fail to pursue global smooth
velocity or are often trapped in local optimums. We focus on the general MOT
problem regardless of the appearance and propose an appearance-free tripartite
matching to avoid the irregular velocity problem of the bipartite matching. The
tripartite matching is formulated as maximizing the likelihood of the state
vectors constituted of the position and velocity of objects, which results in a
chain-dependent structure. We resort to the dynamic programming algorithm to
find such a maximum likelihood estimate. To overcome the high computational
cost induced by the vast search space of dynamic programming when many objects
are to be tracked, we decompose the space by the number of disappearing objects
and propose a reduced-space approach by truncating the decomposition. Extensive
simulations have shown the superiority and efficiency of our proposed method,
and the comparisons with top methods on Cell Tracking Challenge also
demonstrate our competence. We also applied our method to track the motion of
natural killer cells around tumor cells in a cancer study.\footnote{The source

abnormality caused by various retinal diseases/lesions, by only leveraging
normal images in training phase. Normal images from healthy subjects often have
regular structures (e.g., the structured blood vessels in the fundus image, or
structured anatomy in optical coherence tomography image). On the contrary, the
diseases and lesions often destroy these structures. Motivated by this, we
propose to leverage the relation between the image texture and structure to
design a deep neural network for anomaly detection. Specifically, we first
extract the structure of the retinal images, then we combine both the structure
features and the last layer features extracted from original health image to
reconstruct the original input healthy image. The image feature provides the
texture information and guarantees the uniqueness of the image recovered from
the structure. In the end, we further utilize the reconstructed image to
extract the structure and measure the difference between structure extracted
from original and the reconstructed image. On the one hand, minimizing the
reconstruction difference behaves like a regularizer to guarantee that the
image is corrected reconstructed. On the other hand, such structure difference
can also be used as a metric for normality measurement. The whole network is
termed as P-Net because it has a ``P'' shape. Extensive experiments on RESC
dataset and iSee dataset validate the effectiveness of our approach for anomaly
detection in retinal images. Further, our method also generalizes well to novel
class discovery in retinal images and anomaly detection in real-world images.

backward image synthesis, but not depth estimation, as they cannot effectively
neglect occlusions between the target and the reference images. Previous works
rely on rigid photometric assumptions or the SIDE network to infer depth and
occlusions, resulting in limited performance. On the other hand, we propose a
method to ""Forget About the LiDAR"" (FAL), for the training of depth estimators,
with Mirrored Exponential Disparity (MED) probability volumes, from which we
obtain geometrically inspired occlusion maps with our novel Mirrored Occlusion
Module (MOM). Our MOM does not impose a burden on our FAL-net. Contrary to the
previous methods that learn SIDE from stereo pairs by regressing disparity in
the linear space, our FAL-net regresses disparity by binning it into the
exponential space, which allows for better detection of distant and nearby
objects. We define a two-step training strategy for our FAL-net: It is first
trained for view synthesis and then fine-tuned for depth estimation with our
MOM. Our FAL-net is remarkably light-weight and outperforms the previous

speeds on the challenging KITTI dataset. We present extensive experimental

anomalously-hard X-ray bursts from a Galactic magnetar SGR 1935$+$2154. We
investigate the possibility that the event was triggered by the magnetic energy
injection inside the magnetosphere, thereby producing magnetically-trapped
fireball (FB) and relativistic outflows simultaneously. The thermal component
of the X-ray burst is consistent with a trapped FB with an average temperature
of $\sim200$-$300$ keV and size of $\sim10^5$ cm. Meanwhile, the non-thermal
component of the X-ray burst and the coherent radio burst may arise from
relativistic outflows. We calculate the dynamical evolution of the outflow,
launched with an energy budget of $10^{39}$-$10^{40}$ erg comparable to that
for the trapped FB, for different initial baryon load $\eta$ and magnetization
$\sigma_0$. If hard X-ray and radio bursts are both produced by the energy
dissipation of the outflow, the outflow properties are constrained by combining
the conditions for photon escape and the intrinsic timing offset $\lesssim10$
ms among radio and X-ray burst spikes. We show that the hard X-ray burst must
be generated at $r_{\rm X}\gtrsim10^{8}$ cm from the magnetar, irrespective of
the emission mechanism. Moreover, we find that the outflow quickly accelerates
up to a Lorentz factor of $10^2\lesssim\Gamma\lesssim10^3$ by the time it
reaches the edge of the magnetosphere and the dissipation occurs at $10^{12}$
cm $\lesssim r_{\rm radio,X}\lesssim10^{14}$ cm. Our results imply either
extremely-clean ($\eta\gtrsim10^4$) or highly-magnetized
($\sigma_0\gtrsim10^3$) outflows, which might be consistent with the rarity of
the phenomenon.

used here is stronger than similar notions adopted in past work and is
motivated by the practical need to insure privacy regardless of the file
distribution. Two scenarios are considered: Single File Retrieval (SFR) and
Linear Function Retrieval (LFR), where in the latter case each user demands an
arbitrary linear combination of the files at the server. The main contributions
of this paper are a novel achievable scheme for LFR, referred as privacy key
scheme, and a new information theoretic converse bound for SFR. Clearly, being
SFR a special case of LFR, an achievable scheme for LFR works for SFR as well,
and a converse for SFR is a valid converse for LFR as well. By comparing the
performance of the achievable scheme with the converse bound derived in this
paper (for the small cache size regime) and existing converse bounds without
privacy constraints (in the remaining memory regime), the communication load of
the privacy key scheme turns out to be optimal to within a constant
multiplicative gap in all parameter regimes. Numerical results show that the
new privacy key scheme outperforms in some regime known schemes based on the
idea of virtual users, which also satisfy the stronger notion of user privacy
against colluding users adopted here. Moreover, the privacy key scheme enjoys
much lower subpacketization than known schemes based on virtual users.

increasing density of objects in Low Earth Orbit, including legacy assets used
by the astronomy community over decades, the risk of new debris clouds forming
is also increasing. The MWA constitutes a wide field, rapid response passive
radar system and we explore its likely performance in the detection and
characterisation of debris clouds. In general, astronomy facilities such as the
MWA can play a role in protecting the space environment for the future. In
order to undertake this work, we adapt the NASA EVOLVE 4.0 breakup model,
utilising the EVOLVE outputs to produce representative dynamic debris clouds.
We find that the MWA is likely to detect a large fraction (>70%) of modelled
debris cloud fragments for collision masses between 100 kg and 1000 kg for
orbits in the lower part of LEO, if the MWA can achieve close to optimal
detection sensitivity. Useful detection fractions are still achieved for more
conservative assumptions. The detection fraction of fragments decreases as a
function of altitude and inversely with collision mass. Encouragingly, we find
that the wide field nature of the MWA allows the full evolving debris clouds to
be observed in a single observation, with only $\sim2\%$ of the debris
fragments escaping the sensitive portion of the field of view after 100
seconds, for all collision masses and altitudes. These results show that the
MWA is an intrinsically useful facility for the rapid characterisation of

SNNs suffer from high inference latency, resulting from inefficient input
encoding, and sub-optimal settings of the neuron parameters (firing threshold,
and membrane leak). We propose DIET-SNN, a low-latency deep spiking network
that is trained with gradient descent to optimize the membrane leak and the
firing threshold along with other network parameters (weights). The membrane
leak and threshold for each layer of the SNN are optimized with end-to-end
backpropagation to achieve competitive accuracy at reduced latency. The analog
pixel values of an image are directly applied to the input layer of DIET-SNN
without the need to convert to spike-train. The first convolutional layer is
trained to convert inputs into spikes where leaky-integrate-and-fire (LIF)
neurons integrate the weighted inputs and generate an output spike when the
membrane potential crosses the trained firing threshold. The trained membrane
leak controls the flow of input information and attenuates irrelevant inputs to
increase the activation sparsity in the convolutional and dense layers of the
network. The reduced latency combined with high activation sparsity provides
large improvements in computational efficiency. We evaluate DIET-SNN on image
classification tasks from CIFAR and ImageNet datasets on VGG and ResNet
architectures. We achieve top-1 accuracy of 69% with 5 timesteps (inference
latency) on the ImageNet dataset with 12x less compute energy than an

  Estimations","Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In data streams, the data distribution of arriving observations at different
time points may change - a phenomenon called concept drift. While detecting
concept drift is a relatively mature area of study, solutions to the
uncertainty introduced by observations with missing values have only been
studied in isolation. No one has yet explored whether or how these solutions
might impact drift detection performance. We, however, believe that data
imputation methods may actually increase uncertainty in the data rather than
reducing it. We also conjecture that imputation can introduce bias into the
process of estimating distribution changes during drift detection, which can
make it more difficult to train a learning model. Our idea is to focus on
estimating the distance between observations rather than estimating the missing
values, and to define membership functions that allocate observations to
histogram bins according to the estimation errors. Our solution comprises a
novel masked distance learning (MDL) algorithm to reduce the cumulative errors
caused by iteratively estimating each missing value in an observation and a
fuzzy-weighted frequency (FWF) method for identifying discrepancies in the data
distribution. The concept drift detection algorithm proposed in this paper is a
singular and unified algorithm that can handle missing values, but not an
imputation algorithm combined with a concept drift detection algorithm.
Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate the
advantages of this method and show its robustness in detecting drift in data
with missing values. These findings reveal that missing values exert a profound
impact on concept drift detection, but using fuzzy set theory to model
observations can produce more reliable results than imputation.

the use of Facebook targeted advertisements to collect data on low-income shift

rapid-response survey of post-disaster demographic and economic outcomes
fielded through the Facebook app itself. We use these survey responses to
augment app-derived mobility data that comprises Facebook Displacement Maps to
assess the validity of and drivers underlying those observed behavioral trends.
This survey was deployed following the 2019 Australia bushfires to better
understand how these events displaced residents. In doing so we are able to
test a number of key hypotheses around displacement and demographics. In
particular, we uncover several gender differences in key areas, including in
displacement decision-making and timing, and in access to protective equipment
such as smoke masks. We conclude with a brief discussion of research and policy

In this paper, we propose a novel Directed Graph embedding framework based on

generators are trained to generate its fake target and source neighbor nodes
from the same underlying distribution, and the discriminator aims to
distinguish whether a neighbor node is real or fake. The two generators are

DGGAN consistently and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art

This process seems to be inherently discontinuous in the sense that two
consecutive noisy measurements $X_1$ and $X_2$ of the same value may be
extremely close to each other and yet they can be rounded to different points
$P_1\ne P_2$, which is undesirable in many applications. In this paper we show
how to make the rounding process perfectly continuous in the sense that it maps

process consistent rounding, and make it possible by allowing a small amount of
information about the first measurement $X_1$ to be unidirectionally
communicated to and used by the rounding process of $X_2$.
  The fault tolerance of a consistent rounding scheme is defined by the maximum
distance between pairs of measurements which guarantees that they are always

between the amount of information provided and the achievable fault tolerance
for various types of spaces. When the measurements $X_i$ are arbitrary vectors

sufficient and necessary (in the worst case) in order to achieve consistent

brush has not been investigated. In this work, we study the stress in the
stimuli-responsive planar polymer brushes of neutral water-soluble polymers
with low to very high graft densities using strong stretching theory (SST).
First, SST with the Langevin force-extension relation for a polymer chain is
extended to the study of stimuli-responsive brushes. Stress profile and other
properties of a Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) brush are then obtained
using the extended SST and an empirical Flory-Huggins parameter. The model
predicts that the stress in a PNIPAm brush is inhomogeneous and compressive at
all temperatures and graft densities. The resultant stress is predicted to
increase in magnitude with increasing graft density. Moreover, it decreases in
magnitude with an increase in temperature before plateauing in low graft
density brushes. In contrast, its magnitude increases weakly with increasing
temperature in high density brushes. This contrasting behavior is traced to the
minimum in interaction free energy density \emph{vs} polymer volume fraction
curve for PNIPAm solution at a large volume fraction, and stiffening of chains
due to finite extensibility. Furthermore, our results indicate that the ability
to tune the resultant stress by changing temperature diminishes with increasing

  Signal Processing Approach","10 pages, 14 figures",,,,"cs.CR cs.NE","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this paper a randomness evaluation of a block cipher for secure image
communication is presented. The GFHT cipher is a genetic algorithm, that
combines gene fusion (GF) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) both inspired from
antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The symmetric encryption key is generated by
four pairs of chromosomes with multi-layer random sequences. The encryption
starts by a GF of the principal key-agent in a single block, then HGT performs
obfuscation where the genes are pixels and the chromosomes are the rows and
columns. A Salt extracted from the image hash-value is used to implement
one-time pad (OTP) scheme, hence a modification of one pixel generates a
different encryption key without changing the main passphrase or key.
Therefore, an extreme avalanche effect of 99% is achieved. Randomness
evaluation based on random matrix theory, power spectral density, avalanche
effect, 2D auto-correlation, pixels randomness tests and chi-square hypotheses
testing show that encrypted images adopt the statistical behavior of uniform
white noise; hence validating the theoretical model by experimental results.
Moreover, performance comparison with chaos-genetic ciphers shows the merit of
the GFHT algorithm.

which poses significant challenges when building TTS and ASR systems for
extremely low-resource languages. In this paper, we develop LRSpeech, a TTS and
ASR system under the extremely low-resource setting, which can support rare

pre-training on rich-resource languages and fine-tuning on low-resource
languages; 2) dual transformation between TTS and ASR to iteratively boost the
accuracy of each other; 3) knowledge distillation to customize the TTS model on
a high-quality target-speaker voice and improve the ASR model on multiple
voices. We conduct experiments on an experimental language (English) and a
truly low-resource language (Lithuanian) to verify the effectiveness of
LRSpeech. Experimental results show that LRSpeech 1) achieves high quality for
TTS in terms of both intelligibility (more than 98% intelligibility rate) and
naturalness (above 3.5 mean opinion score (MOS)) of the synthesized speech,

recognition accuracy for ASR, and 3) last but not least, uses extremely

guidances for industrial deployment. We are currently deploying LRSpeech into a

networks and satellites, or generated from numerical models, has brought much
attention to multivariate spatio-temporal statistical models, where the
covariance function plays a key role in modeling, inference, and prediction.
For multivariate space-time data, understanding the spatio-temporal
variability, within and across variables, is essential in employing a realistic
covariance model. Meanwhile, the complexity of generic covariances often makes
model fitting very challenging, and simplified covariance structures, including
symmetry and separability, can reduce the model complexity and facilitate the
inference procedure. However, a careful examination of these properties is
needed in real applications. In the work presented here, we formally define
these properties for multivariate spatio-temporal random fields and use
functional data analysis techniques to visualize them, hence providing
intuitive interpretations. We then propose a rigorous rank-based testing
procedure to conclude whether the simplified properties of covariance are
suitable for the underlying multivariate space-time data. The good performance
of our method is illustrated through synthetic data, for which we know the true
structure. We also investigate the covariance of bivariate wind speed, a key
variable in renewable energy, over a coastal and an inland area in Saudi
Arabia. The Supplementary Material is available online, including the R code

HC$_3$N (HC$_3$N*) only towards one star-forming region of the SB ring.
Remarkably, HC$_3$N* was not detected towards the CND despite its large HC$_3$N
$v=0$ column density. From LTE and non-LTE modelling of HC$_3$N*, we obtained a
dust temperature of $ T_\text{dust} \sim 250$ K and a density of
$n_{\text{H}_2}=6\times10^5$ cm$^{-3}$ for this star-forming region. The
estimated IR luminosity of $5.8\times10^8$ L$_\odot$ is typical of proto-Super
Star Clusters (proto-SSC) observed in the SB galaxy NGC 253. We use the
continuum emissions at $147$ GHz and $350$ GHz, along with CO and Pa $\alpha$,
to estimate the ages of other $14$ SSCs in the SB ring. We find the youngest
SSCs to be associated with the region connecting the nuclear bar with the SB
ring, supporting the scenario of sequential star formation. For the CND, our
analysis yields $T_\text{dust} \leqslant 100$ K and
$n_{\text{H}_2}\sim(3-6)\times10^5$cm$^{-3}$. The very different dust
temperatures found for the CND and the proto-SSC indicates that, while the dust
in the proto-SSC is being efficiently heated from the inside by the radiation
from massive proto-stars, the CND is being heated externally by the AGN, which
in the IR optically thin case can only heat the dust to $56$ K. We discuss the
implications of the non-detection of HC$_3$N* near the luminous AGN in NGC 1068

Satisfactory performance can be obtained using high-grade 3D LiDAR with 64
channels, which can provide dense point clouds. Unfortunately, the high price
significantly prevents its extensive commercialization in ADV. The
cost-effective 3D LiDAR with 16 channels is a promising replacement. However,
only limited and sparse point clouds can be provided by the 16 channels LiDAR,
which cannot guarantee sufficient positioning accuracy for ADV in challenging
dynamic environments. The high-resolution image from the low-cost camera can
provide ample information about the surroundings. However, the explicit depth
information is not available from the image. Inspired by the complementariness
of 3D LiDAR and camera, this paper proposes to make use of the high-resolution
images from a camera to enrich the raw 3D point clouds from the low-cost 16
channels LiDAR based on a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm. An ERFNet
is firstly employed to segment the image with the aid of the raw sparse 3D
point clouds. Meanwhile, the sparse convolutional neural network is employed to
predict the dense point clouds based on raw sparse 3D point clouds. Then, the
predicted dense point clouds are fused with the segmentation outputs from
ERFnet using a novel multi-layer convolutional neural network to refine the
predicted 3D point clouds. Finally, the enriched point clouds are employed to
perform LiDAR SLAM based on the state-of-the-art normal distribution transform
(NDT). We tested our approach on the re-edited KITTI datasets: (1)the sparse 3D
point clouds are significantly enriched with a mean square error of 1.1m MSE.
(2)the map generated from the LiDAR SLAM is denser which includes more details

by the effect of small dissipation coefficient, most existing theoretical
analysis relies on adding additional stabilization terms, mollifying the
nonlinearity or introducing auxiliary variables which implicitly either changes
the structure of the problem or trades accuracy for stability in a subtle way.
In this work we introduce a robust theoretical framework to analyze directly
the stability of the standard implicit-explicit approach without stabilization
or any other modification. We take
  the Cahn-Hilliard equation as a model case and prove energy stability under
natural time step constraints which are optimal with respect to energy scaling.

training data very well and often fit even outliers and mislabeled data points.
Such fitting requires memorization of training data labels, a phenomenon that
has attracted significant research interest but has not been given a compelling
explanation so far. A recent work of Feldman (2019) proposes a theoretical
explanation for this phenomenon based on a combination of two insights. First,
natural image and data distributions are (informally) known to be long-tailed,
that is have a significant fraction of rare and atypical examples. Second, in a
simple theoretical model such memorization is necessary for achieving
close-to-optimal generalization error when the data distribution is
long-tailed. However, no direct empirical evidence for this explanation or even
an approach for obtaining such evidence were given.
  In this work we design experiments to test the key ideas in this theory. The
experiments require estimation of the influence of each training example on the
accuracy at each test example as well as memorization values of training
examples. Estimating these quantities directly is computationally prohibitive
but we show that closely-related subsampled influence and memorization values
can be estimated much more efficiently. Our experiments demonstrate the
significant benefits of memorization for generalization on several standard
benchmarks. They also provide quantitative and visually compelling evidence for
the theory put forth in (Feldman, 2019).

the tracking performance. However, the temporal information hidden in the
response maps is not considered in SRDCF, which limits the discriminative power
and the robustness for accurate tracking. This work proposes a novel approach
with dynamic consistency pursued correlation filters, i.e., the CPCF tracker.
Specifically, through a correlation operation between adjacent response maps, a
practical consistency map is generated to represent the consistency level
across frames. By minimizing the difference between the practical and the
scheduled ideal consistency map, the consistency level is constrained to
maintain temporal smoothness, and rich temporal information contained in
response maps is introduced. Besides, a dynamic constraint strategy is proposed
to further improve the adaptability of the proposed tracker in complex
situations. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on three challenging UAV
benchmarks, i.e., UAV123@10FPS, UAVDT, and DTB70. Based on the experimental

scenarios of Fast Style Transfer. At present, the two existing solutions are
purchasing more memory and using the feathering-based method, but the former

with low memory consumption. This method can act as a plug-in for Fast Style
Transfer without any modification to the network architecture. We use the most

all stages, the traditional dynamic programming is inapplicable as the
principle of time consistency fails. We study this problem from a new
perspective called the sensitivity-based optimization theory. A performance
difference formula is derived and it can quantify the difference of the
mean-variance combined metrics of MDPs under any two different policies. The
difference formula can be utilized to generate new policies with strictly
improved mean-variance performance. A necessary condition of the optimal policy
and the optimality of deterministic policies are derived. We further develop an
iterative algorithm with a form of policy iteration, which is proved to
converge to local optima both in the mixed and randomized policy space.
Specially, when the mean reward is constant in policies, the algorithm is
guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. Finally, we apply our approach to
study the fluctuation reduction of wind power in an energy storage system,

define a similarity metric to compare one recording to another. Music
similarity, however, is hard to define and depends on multiple simultaneous
notions of similarity (i.e. genre, mood, instrument, tempo). While prior work
ignore this issue, we embrace this idea and introduce the concept of
multidimensional similarity and unify both global and specialized similarity
metrics into a single, semantically disentangled multidimensional similarity
metric. To do so, we adapt a variant of deep metric learning called conditional
similarity networks to the audio domain and extend it using track-based
information to control the specificity of our model. We evaluate our method and
show that our single, multidimensional model outperforms both specialized
similarity spaces and alternative baselines. We also run a user-study and show
that our approach is favored by human annotators as well.

structures are known around a handful of late-type carbon-rich WR stars with
massive companions were the dust formed at the zone where the two winds collide
produces a plume of dense gas and dust that is carried out with the WR wind. As
the binary system rotates, an Archimedean spiral detectable in the infrared is
formed. The resulting pinwheel contains information on wind speeds,
wind-momentum ratio and orbital parameters. However, WR147 is a WN star and the
formation of dust is unlikely so a different emission mechanism must be at
work. Our analysis of the data suggests that in this case the emission is
dominantly of non-thermal nature (synchrotron), although we cannot exclude that
some clumps could be brighter in free-free emission. It is possible that the
pinwheels associated with WN stars will be detectable only as non-thermal
emitters at radio wavelengths. From the characteristics of the pinwheel we
estimate a period of 1.7 years for the binary system (the WN8 star and a

representation that can generalize well across tasks. Along with
generalization, the emerging concept of disentangled representations is also of

representation space. In this paper we present a single representation learning
framework that elucidates the relationship between metric learning,

outline past work on the relationship between metric learning and

three different learning approaches and their disentangled versions, and (3)
evaluate all models on four tasks (training time, similarity retrieval,

programming languages or code history of the project under development or of
other projects using common APIs. In this work, we present a novel approach for
improving current function-calls completion tools by learning from independent
code repositories, using well-known natural language processing models that can
learn vector representation of source code (code embeddings). Our models are
not trained on historical data of specific projects. Instead, our approach
allows to learn high-level concepts and their relationships present among
thousands of projects. As a consequence, the resulting system is able to
provide general suggestions that are not specific to particular projects or

our approach suggests function calls relevant to that context. We evaluated our
approach on a set of open-source projects unseen during the training. The

the treatment effects estimation. Unlike existing methods, the resulting
estimator for a treatment effect under this new framework is a simple
kernel-based $U$-statistic after applying a data-driven transformation to the
observed covariates. We characterize the theoretical properties of the new
estimators of treatment effects under a nonparametric setting and show that
they are able to work robustly under low regularity conditions. The new
framework is also applied to several numerical examples to demonstrate its
practical merits.

Previous approaches either rely on single dominant component or consider $k

mixtures, but impose constraint on the level of noise replacing inactive
sources. Here, we propose an effective, computationally less complex, and more
robust to noise UBI approach to tackle such restrictions when $k = m-1$ based
on a two-step scenario: (1) estimating the orthogonal complement subspaces of
the overall space and (2) identifying the mixing vectors. For this purpose, an
integrated algorithm is presented to solve both steps based on Gram-Schmidt
process and random sample consensus method. Experimental results using
simulated data show more effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the

binary mixture which is first slowly annealed well below the glass transition
temperature and then subjected to elastostatic loading either along a single
direction or along two and three alternating directions. We find that at
sufficiently large values of the static stress, the binary glass becomes
rejuvenated via collective, irreversible rearrangements of atoms. Upon
including additional orientation of the static stress in the loading protocol,
the rejuvenation effect is amplified and the typical size of clusters of atoms
with large nonaffine displacements increases. As a result of prolonged

overshoot during startup continuous compression become significantly reduced,
especially for loading protocols with alternating stress orientation. These
findings are important for the design of novel processing methods to improve

the graph Laplacian matrix, which reflects the topological structure of image,
to further impose the smoothing priors to the denoised depth image. To achieve
fast speed and high convergence, the alternating direction method of

support fast local inferences. However, they suffer from a new security
problem, i.e., being vulnerable to physical access based attacks. An adversary
can easily obtain the entire neural network (NN) model by physically snooping
the GDDR memory bus that connects the accelerator chip with DRAM memory.
Therefore, memory encryption becomes important for DL accelerators on edge
devices to improve the security of NN models. Nevertheless, we observe that
traditional memory encryption solutions that have been efficiently used in CPU
systems cause significant performance degradation when directly used in DL
accelerators. The main reason comes from the big bandwidth gap between the GDDR
memory bus and the encryption engine. To address this problem, our paper
proposes SEAL, a Secure and Efficient Accelerator scheme for deep Learning.
SEAL enhances the performance of the encrypted DL accelerator from two aspects,
i.e., improving the data access bandwidth and the efficiency of memory
encryption. Specifically, to improve the data access bandwidth, SEAL leverages
a criticality-aware smart encryption scheme which identifies partial data that
have no impact on the security of NN models and allows them to bypass the
encryption engine, thus reducing the amount of data to be encrypted. To improve
the efficiency of memory encryption, SEAL leverages a colocation mode
encryption scheme to eliminate memory accesses from counters used for
encryption by co-locating data and their counters. Our experimental results
demonstrate that, compared with traditional memory encryption solutions, SEAL
achieves 1.4 ~ 1.6 times IPC improvement and reduces the inference latency by
39% ~ 60%. Compared with a baseline accelerator without memory encryption, SEAL
compromises only 5% ~ 7% IPC for significant security improvement.

SC-WaveRNN exploits additional information given in the form of speaker
embeddings. Using publicly-available data for training, SC-WaveRNN achieves
significantly better performance over baseline WaveRNN on both subjective and

seen speaker and seen recording condition and up to 95% for unseen speaker and

vital in multihop Ad-hoc Social Networks (ASNETs). In this networking paradigm,
transmission unreliability could be caused by multiple social applications
running on a single node. This leads to contentions among nodes and connection
paths. In addition, congestions can be the result of multiple senders
transmitting data to a single receiver and every sender waiting for a positive
acknowledgment to move on. Therefore, traditional Transmission Control Protocol
(TCP) performs poorly in ASNETs, due to the fact that the available bandwidth
is shared among nodes using round trip time and the acknowledgment is provided
individually to every data packet. To solve these issues, we propose a
technique, called Overhead Control with Reliable Transmission of Popular
Packets in Ad-Hoc Social Networks (RTPS), which improves transmission
reliability by assigning bandwidth to users based on their popularity levels:
extra bandwidth is assigned to the nodes with higher popularity and their
acknowledgments are sent with higher priority. In addition, RTPS further
reduces contentions and packet losses by delaying acknowledgment packet
transmissions. Our detailed investigations demonstrate the excellent
performance of RTPS in terms of throughput latency and overhead with different
hop-distances and different numbers of concurrent TCP flows.

traditionally been rather cumbersome. A recently-developed theory --
Localisation Landscape Theory (LLT) -- has unparalleled strengths and
advantages, both computational and conceptual, over alternative methods. To
begin with, we demonstrate that the localisation length cannot be conveniently
computed starting directly from the exact eigenstates, thus motivating the need
for the LLT approach. Then, we confirm that the Hamiltonian with the effective
potential of LLT has very similar low energy eigenstates to that with the
physical potential, justifying the crucial role the effective potential plays
in our new method. We proceed to use LLT to calculate the localisation length
for very low-energy, maximally localised eigenstates, as defined by the
length-scale of exponential decay of the eigenstates, (manually) testing our
findings against exact diagonalisation. We then describe several mechanisms by
which the eigenstates spread out at higher energies where the
tunnelling-in-the-effective-potential picture breaks down, and explicitly
demonstrate that our method is no longer applicable in this regime. We place
our computational scheme in context by explaining the connection to the more
general problem of multidimensional tunnelling and discussing the
approximations involved. Our method of calculating the localisation length can
be applied to (nearly) arbitrary disordered, continuous potentials at very low

risk. While considerable efforts have been made in this direction, a
long-standing challenge is how to effectively exploit internal user information

sequence from dual perspectives, i.e., field value variations and field
interactions simultaneously for fraud detection. The proposed model is deployed
in the risk management system of one of the world's largest e-commerce

Experimental results on real industrial data from different regions in the
platform clearly demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements

colony (ABC) algorithm, we propose a new clustering protocol, namely BeeCup, to
save the energy of mobile devices while guaranteeing the quality of learning.
The BeeCup protocol takes advantage of biologically-inspired computation, with
focus on improving the energy efficiency of mobile devices. It first estimates
the number of cluster heads (CHs) adaptively according to the network scale,
and then selects the CHs by employing the ABC algorithm. In case some CHs
consume energy excessively, clusters will be dynamically updated to keep energy
consumption balanced within the whole network. Simulation results demonstrate
the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed protocol.

Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This pathogenic
virus is able to spread asymptotically during its incubation stage through a
vulnerable population. Given the state of healthcare, policymakers were urged
to contain the spread of infection, minimize stress on the health systems and
ensure public safety. Most effective tool that was at their disposal was to
close non-essential business and issue a stay home order. In this paper we
consider techniques to measure the effectiveness of stringency measures adopted
by governments across the world. Analyzing effectiveness of control measures
like lock-down allows us to understand whether the decisions made were optimal
and resulted in a reduction of burden on the healthcare system. In specific we
consider using a synthetic control to construct alternative scenarios and
understand what would have been the effect on health if less stringent measures
were adopted. We present analysis for The State of New York, United States,
Italy and The Indian capital city Delhi and show how lock-down measures has
helped and what the counterfactual scenarios would have been in comparison to
the current state of affairs. We show that in The State of New York the number
of deaths could have been 6 times higher, and in Italy, the number of deaths
could have been 3 times higher by 26th of June, 2020.

trait judgments from facial clues. Although these face-based impressions lack
the evidence to determine validity, they are of vital importance, because they
may relate to human network-based social behavior, such as seeking certain
individuals for help, advice, dating, and cooperation, and thus they may relate
to centrality in social networks. However, little to no work has investigated
the apparent facial traits that influence network centrality, despite the large
amount of research on attributions of the central position including
personality and behavior. In this paper, we examine whether perceived traits
based on facial appearance affect network centrality by exploring the initial
stage of social network formation in a first-year college residential area. We
took face photos of participants who are freshmen living in the same
residential area, and we asked them to nominate community members linking to
different networks. We then collected facial perception data by requiring other
participants to rate facial images for three main attributions: dominance,
trustworthiness, and attractiveness. Meanwhile, we proposed a framework to
discover how facial appearance affects social networks. Our results revealed
that perceived facial traits were correlated with the network centrality and
that they were indicative to predict the centrality of people in different
networks. Our findings provide psychological evidence regarding the interaction
between faces and network centrality. Our findings also offer insights in to a
combination of psychological and social network techniques, and they highlight
the function of facial bias in cuing and signaling social traits. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to explore the influence of facial
perception on centrality in social networks.

  power transfer","19 pages, 5 figures",,,,"physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  As an important class of systems with unique topological effects beyond the
periodic lattices, quasiperiodic topological structures have attracted much
attention in recent years. Due to the quasiperiodic modulation, the topological
states in the quasiperiodic topological structures have the characteristics of
self-similarity, which can be used to observe the charming Hofstadter
butterfly. In addition, because of the asymmetric distribution, the edge states
in quasiperiodic chain can be used to realize the adiabatic pumping. When the
topological parameters in quasiperiodic topological lattices are considered as
synthetic dimensions, they can also be used to study the topological properties
with higher dimensions. Here, by using ultra-subwavelength resonators, we
design and fabricate a type of one-dimensional quasiperiodic Harper chain with
asymmetric topological edge states for the directional wireless power transfer
(WPT). By further introducing a power source into the system, we selectively
light up two Chinese characters which is composed of LED lamps at both ends of
the chain. Moreover, the directional WPT implemented by the topological
quasiperiodic chain has the property of topological protection, which is immune
to the internal disorder perturbation of the structure. Not only do we apply
the asymmetric edge state for directional WPT, but also may further actively
control the directional WPT by using the external voltage. In addition, this
work provides a flexible platform for designing new WPT devices, such as using
the corner states in high-order topological structures or the skin effect in
the non-Hermitian topological lattices.

inversion, and the topological edge mode (TEM) in the photonic insulators, have
been widely studied. Whether people can take advantage of intriguing
topological modes in simple one-dimensional systems to implement some practical
applications is an issue which people are increasingly concerned about. In this
work, based on a photonic dimer chain composed of ultra-subwavelength
resonators, we verify experimentally that the TEM in the effective second-order
parity-time (PT) system is immune to the inner disorder perturbation, and can
be used to realize the long-range wireless power transfer (WPT) with high
transmission efficiency. To intuitively show the TEM can be used for WPT, a
power signal source is used to excite the TEM. It can be clearly seen that two
LED lamps with 0.5-W at both ends of the structure are lighted up with the aid
of TEMs. In addition, in order to solve the special technical problems of
standby power loss and frequency tracking, we further propose that a WPT system
with effective third-order PT symmetry can be constructed by using one
topological interface mode and two TEMs. Inspired by the long-range WPT with
TEMs in this work, it is expected to use more complex topological structures to
achieve energy transmission with more functions, such as the WPT devices whose
direction can be selected flexibly in the quasiperiodic or trimer topological
chains.

in resource scarce environments is one of the challenging tasks. Traditional
Transport Control Protocol (TCP) uses the round trip time mechanism for sharing
bandwidth resources between users. However, it does not explore socially-aware
properties between nodes and cannot differentiate effectively between various
types of packet losses in wireless networks. In this paper, a socially-aware
congestion avoidance protocol, namely TIBIAS, which takes advantage of
similarity matching social properties among intermediate nodes, is proposed to
improve the resource efficiency of ASNETs. TIBIAS performs efficient data
transfer over TCP. During the course of bandwidth resource allocation, it gives
high priority for maximally matched interest similarity between different TCP
connections on ASNET links. TIBIAS does not require any modification at lower
layers or on receiver nodes. Experimental results show that TIBIAS performs
better as compared against existing protocols, in terms of link utilization,
unnecessary reduction of the congestion window, throughput and retransmission
ratio.
