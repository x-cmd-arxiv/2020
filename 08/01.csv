variety of tasks, out-performing human-designed networks. However, many
assumptions, that require human definition, related with the problems being
solved or the models generated are still needed: final model architectures,
number of layers to be sampled, forced operations, small search spaces, which
ultimately contributes to having models with higher performances at the cost of
inducing bias into the system. In this paper, we propose HMCNAS, which is
composed of two novel components: i) a method that leverages information about
human-designed models to autonomously generate a complex search space, and ii)
an Evolutionary Algorithm with Bayesian Optimization that is capable of
generating competitive CNNs from scratch, without relying on human-defined
parameters or small search spaces. The experimental results show that the
proposed approach results in competitive architectures obtained in a very short
time. HMCNAS provides a step towards generalizing NAS, by providing a way to
create competitive models, without requiring any human knowledge about the
specific task.

problems, but recently there have been investigations into optimizing network
characteristics. Optimizing network connectivity to maximize the number of
nodes within a given distance to a focal node and then minimizing the number
and length of additional connections has not been as thoroughly explored, yet
is important in several domains including transportation planning,
telecommunications networks, and geospatial analysis. We compare several
heuristics to explore this network connectivity optimization problem with the
use of random networks, including the introduction of two planar random
networks that are useful for spatial network simulation research, and a
real-world case study from urban planning and public health. We observe
significant variation between nodal characteristics and optimal connections
across network types. This result along with the computational costs of the
search for optimal solutions highlights the difficulty of finding effective
heuristics. A novel genetic algorithm is proposed and we find this optimization
heuristic outperforms existing techniques and describe how it can be applied to
other combinatorial and dynamic problems.

intervention strategies to control the spread of emerging diseases such as

studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing
epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between
wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory
has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function
of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an
analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic
closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase
predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease,
as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we
demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally
effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Our
results compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 models
where infectivity and recovery show significant variability.

and angular diameter distances are related via the Etherington relation, also
known as the distance-duality relation (DDR). A violation of this relation
would rule out the standard cosmological paradigm and point at the presence of
new physics. We quantify the ability of Euclid, in combination with
contemporary surveys, to improve the current constraints on deviations from the
DDR in the redshift range $0<z<1.6$. We start by an analysis of the latest
available data, improving previously reported constraints by a factor of 2.5.
We then present a detailed analysis of simulated Euclid and external data
products, using both standard parametric methods (relying on phenomenological
descriptions of possible DDR violations) and a machine learning reconstruction
using Genetic Algorithms. We find that for parametric methods Euclid can (in
combination with external probes) improve current constraints by approximately
a factor of six, while for non-parametric methods Euclid can improve current
constraints by a factor of three. Our results highlight the importance of
surveys like Euclid in accurately testing the pillars of the current
cosmological paradigm and constraining physics beyond the standard cosmological
model.

of eigenvalues converging to zero, and the single layer potentials of the
corresponding eigenfunctions, called plasmons, decay to zero, i.e., are
localized on the surface, as the index of the sequence $j$ tends to infinity.
We investigate quantitatively the surface localization of the plasmons in three
dimensions. The results are threefold. We first prove that on smooth bounded
domains of general shape the sequence of plasmons converges to zero off the
boundary surface almost surely at the rate of $j^{-1/2}$. We then prove that if
the domain is strictly convex, then the convergence rate becomes $j^{-\infty}$,
namely, it is faster than $j^{-N}$ for any integer $N$. As a consequence, we
prove that cloaking by anomalous localized resonance does not occur on
three-dimensional strictly convex smooth domains. We then look into the surface
localization of the plasmons on the Clifford torus by numerical computations.
The Clifford torus is taken as an example of non-convex surfaces. The
computational results show that the torus exhibits the spectral property
completely different from strictly convex domains. In particular, they suggest
that there is a subsequence of plasmons on the torus which has much slower
decay than other entries of the sequence.

in empirical relationships to predict solar wind speed ($v_{obs}$) at 1 AU,
based on an inverse relationship between these two quantities. Coronal unipolar
streamers (i.e. pseudostreamers) undergo limited field line expansion,
resulting in $f_s$-dependent relationships to predict fast wind associated with
these structures. However, case studies have shown that in situ observed
pseudostreamer solar wind was much slower than that derived with $f_s$. To
investigate this further, we conduct a statistical analysis to determine if
$f_s$ and $v_{obs}$ are inversely correlated for a large sample of periods when
pseudostreamer wind was observed at multiple 1 AU spacecraft (i.e. ACE,
STEREO-A/B). We use the Wang-Sheeley-Arge (WSA) model driven by Air Force Data
Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport (ADAPT) photospheric field maps to
identify 38 periods when spacecraft observe pseudostreamer wind. We compare the
expansion factor of the last open field lines on either side of a
pseudostreamer cusp with the corresponding in situ measured solar wind speed.
We find only slow wind ($v_{obs}$ $<$ 500 km/s) is associated with
pseudostreamers, and that there is not a significant correlation between $f_s$
and $v_{obs}$ for these field lines. This suggests that field lines near the
open-closed boundary of pseudostreamers are not subject to the steady-state
acceleration along continuously open flux tubes assumed in the $f_s$-$v_{obs}$
relationship. In general, dynamics at the boundary between open and closed
field lines such as interchange reconnection will invalidate the steady-state
assumptions of this relationship.

audio application fields. However, the high accuracy of these models comes at
the expense of a tremendous computation cost. This aspect is almost always
overlooked in evaluating the quality of proposed models. However, models should
not be evaluated without taking into account their complexity. This aspect is
especially critical in audio applications, which heavily relies on specialized
embedded hardware with real-time constraints. In this paper, we build on recent
observations that deep models are highly overparameterized, by studying the
lottery ticket hypothesis on deep generative audio models. This hypothesis
states that extremely efficient small sub-networks exist in deep models and
would provide higher accuracy than larger models if trained in isolation.
However, lottery tickets are found by relying on unstructured masking, which
means that resulting models do not provide any gain in either disk size or
inference time. Instead, we develop here a method aimed at performing
structured trimming. We show that this requires to rely on global selection and
introduce a specific criterion based on mutual information. First, we confirm
the surprising result that smaller models provide higher accuracy than their
large counterparts. We further show that we can remove up to 95% of the model
weights without significant degradation in accuracy. Hence, we can obtain very
light models for generative audio across popular methods such as Wavenet, SING
or DDSP, that are up to 100 times smaller with commensurate accuracy. We study
the theoretical bounds for embedding these models on Raspberry Pi and Arduino,
and show that we can obtain generative models on CPU with equivalent quality as
large GPU models. Finally, we discuss the possibility of implementing deep

accelerating encryption/decryption. While GPUs are an attractive platform in
terms of performance, the security of these devices raises a number of
concerns. One vulnerability is the data-dependent timing information, which can
be exploited by adversary to recover the encryption key. Memory system features
are frequently exploited since they create detectable timing variations. In
this paper, our attack model is a coalescing attack, which leverages a critical
GPU microarchitectural feature -- the coalescing unit. As multiple concurrent
GPU memory requests can refer to the same cache block, the coalescing unit
collapses them into a single memory transaction. The access time of an
encryption kernel is dependent on the number of transactions. Correlation
between a guessed key value and the associated timing samples can be exploited
to recover the secret key. In this paper, a series of hardware/software
countermeasures are proposed to obfuscate the memory timing side channel,
making the GPU more resilient without impacting performance. Our hardware-based
approach attempts to randomize the width of the coalescing unit to lower the
signal-to-noise ratio. We present a hierarchical Miss Status Holding Register
(MSHR) design that can merge transactions across different warps. This feature
boosts performance, while, at the same time, secures the execution. We also
present a software-based approach to permute the organization of critical data
structures, significantly changing the coalescing behavior and introducing a
high degree of randomness. Equipped with our new protections, the effort to
launch a successful attack is increased up to 1433X . 178X, while also
improving encryption/decryption performance up to 7%.

challenge in such 3D stacked designs due to a general increase in power
density. In this work, we perform a thorough thermal simulation study on
sign-off quality physical design implementation of a state-of-the-art,
high-performance, out-of-order microprocessor on a 7nm process technology. The
physical design of the microprocessor is partitioned and implemented in a
2-tier, 3D stacked configuration with logic blocks and memory instances in
separate tiers (logic-over-memory 3D). The thermal simulation model was
calibrated to temperature measurement data from a high-performance, CPU-based
2D SoC chip fabricated on the same 7nm process technology. Thermal profiles of
different 3D configurations under various workload conditions are simulated and
compared. We find that stacking microprocessor designs in 3D without
considering thermal implications can result in maximum die temperature up to
12{\deg}C higher than their 2D counterparts under the worst-case
power-indicative workload. This increase in temperature would reduce the amount
of time for which a power-intensive workload can be run before throttling is
required. However, logic-over-memory partitioned 3D CPU implementation can
mitigate this temperature increase by half, which makes the temperature of the
3D design only 6$^\circ$C higher than the 2D baseline. We conclude that using
thermal aware design partitioning and improved cooling techniques can overcome
the thermal challenges associated with 3D stacking.

across all tasks. However, the consistently overlooked downside of these models
is their stunningly massive complexity, which seems concomitantly crucial to
their success. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a model
pruning method based on the lottery ticket hypothesis. We modify the original
approach to allow for explicitly removing parameters, through structured
trimming of entire units, instead of simply masking individual weights. This
leads to models which are effectively lighter in terms of size, memory and
number of operations. We show that our proposal can remove up to 90% of the
model parameters without loss of accuracy, leading to ultra-light deep MIR
models. We confirm the surprising result that, at smaller compression ratios
(removing up to 85% of a network), lighter models consistently outperform their
heavier counterparts. We exhibit these results on a large array of MIR tasks
including audio classification, pitch recognition, chord extraction, drum
transcription and onset estimation. The resulting ultra-light deep learning
models for MIR can run on CPU, and can even fit on embedded devices with
minimal degradation of accuracy.

reordering. We propose the first near-linear time algorithms for several graph
partitioning problems in the contiguous regime.
  Traditional objectives such as the simple edge cut, hyperedge cut, or
hypergraph connectivity minimize the total cost of all parts under a balance
constraint. Our total partitioners use $O(Km + N)$ space. They run in
$O((Km\log(m) + N)\log(N))$ time, a significant improvement over prior $O(K(m^2
+ N))$ time algorithms due to Kernighan and Grandjean et. al.
  Bottleneck partitioning minimizes the maximum cost of any part. We propose a
new bottleneck cost which reflects the sum of communication and computation on
each part. Our bottleneck partitioners use linear space. The exact algorithm
runs in linear time when $K^2$ is $O(N^C)$ for $C < 1$. Our $(1 +
\epsilon)$-approximate algorithm runs in linear time when
$K\log(c_{high}/(c_{low}\epsilon))$ is $O(N^C)$ for $C < 1$, where $c_{high}$
and $c_{low}$ are upper and lower bounds on the optimal cost. We also propose a
simpler $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximate algorithm which runs in a factor of
$\log(c_{high}/(c_{low}\epsilon))$ from linear time.

high-quality contiguous partitions on a test suite of $42$ test matrices. When

this work, we reformulate embedding training under the meta-learning paradigm.
We redistribute the training corpus as an ensemble of multiple related speaker

unseen speakers. First, we develop an open source toolkit to train x-vectors
that is matched in performance with pre-trained Kaldi models for speaker
diarization and speaker verification applications. We find that different

Next, we use two meta-learning strategies, namely prototypical networks and
relation networks, to improve over the x-vector embeddings. Our best performing

laminar separation bubble (LSB) that forms near the leading edge of a NACA 0012
airfoil at a chord-based Reynolds number of 500,000 and an angle of attack of 8
degrees. Randomized SVD is adopted in the present analysis to relieve the
computational cost associated with the high-Re global base flow. To examine the
local physics over the LSB, we consider the use of exponential discounting to
limit the time horizon that allows for the instability to develop with respect
to the base flow. With discounting, the gain distribution over frequency
accurately captures the spectral content over the LSB obtained from flow
simulation. The peak-gain frequency also agrees with previous flow control
results on suppressing dynamic stall over a pitching airfoil. According to the
gain distribution and the modal structures, we conclude that the dominant
energy-amplification mechanism is the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. In addition
to discounting, we also examine the use of spatial windows for both the forcing
and response. From the response-windowed analysis, we find that the LSB serves
the main role of energy amplifier, with the amplification saturating at the
reattachment point. The input window imposes the constraint of surface forcing,
and the results show that the optimal actuator location is slightly upstream of
the separation point. The surface-forcing mode also suggest the optimal
momentum forcing in the surface-tangent direction, with strong
uni-directionality that is ideal for synthetic-jet-type actuators. This study
demonstrates the strength of randomized resolvent analysis in tackling
high-Reynolds-number base flows and calls attention to the care needed for

behavior mainly depends on the driving frequency of the electric field. The
largest change of double occupancy occurs during the pulse. For frequencies
below the Mott gap, we observe multiphoton excitations at large field
intensities. For frequencies beyond the gap energy, there is a region where
Auger recombination reduces the double occupancy after the pulse. Impact
ionization (Multi Exciton Generation), namely a growing double occupancy after
the pulse, occurs for frequencies larger than twice the Mott gap. From the

using linear spans of arbitrary finite schemes of bounded length, while secant
varieties use only isolated reduced points. In particular, any secant variety
is always contained in the respective cactus variety, and, except in a few
initial cases, the inclusion is strict. It is known that lots of natural
criteria that test membership in secant varieties are actually only tests for
membership in cactus varieties. In this article, we propose the first
techniques to distinguish actual secant variety from the cactus variety in the
case of the Veronese variety. We focus on two initial cases,
$\kappa_{14}(\nu_d(\mathbb{P}^n))$ and $\kappa_{8,3}(\nu_d(\mathbb{P}^n))$, the
simplest that exhibit the difference between cactus and secant varieties. We
show that for $d\geq 5$, the component of the cactus variety
$\kappa_{14}(\nu_d(\mathbb{P}^6))$ other than the secant variety
$\sigma_{14}(\nu_d(\mathbb{P}^6))$ consists of degree $d$ polynomials divisible
by a $(d-3)$-rd power of a linear form. We generalize this description to an
arbitrary number of variables. We present an algorithm for deciding whether a
point in the cactus variety $\kappa_{14}(\nu_d(\mathbb{P}^n))$ belongs to the
secant variety $\sigma_{14}(\nu_d(\mathbb{P}^n))$ for $d\geq 6,$ $n \geq 6$. We
obtain similar results for the Grassmann cactus variety
$\kappa_{8,3}(\nu_d(\mathbb{P}^n))$. Our intermediate results give also a
partial answer to analogous problems for other cactus varieties and Grassmann
cactus varieties to any Veronese variety.

signals to a receiver with different modulation types while the receiver
classifies the modulation types of the received signals using its deep
learning-based classifier. Concurrently, an adversary transmits adversarial
perturbations using its multiple antennas to fool the classifier into
misclassifying the received signals. From the adversarial machine learning
perspective, we show how to utilize multiple antennas at the adversary to
improve the adversarial (evasion) attack performance. Two main points are
considered while exploiting the multiple antennas at the adversary, namely the
power allocation among antennas and the utilization of channel diversity.
First, we show that multiple independent adversaries, each with a single
antenna cannot improve the attack performance compared to a single adversary
with multiple antennas using the same total power. Then, we consider various
ways to allocate power among multiple antennas at a single adversary such as
allocating power to only one antenna, and proportional or inversely
proportional to the channel gain. By utilizing channel diversity, we introduce
an attack to transmit the adversarial perturbation through the channel with the
largest channel gain at the symbol level. We show that this attack reduces the
classifier accuracy significantly compared to other attacks under different
channel conditions in terms of channel variance and channel correlation across
antennas. Also, we show that the attack success improves significantly as the
number of antennas increases at the adversary that can better utilize channel
diversity to craft adversarial attacks.

biological tissues, biopolymers driven by molecular motors, and suspensions of
synthetic self-propelled particles. A central question in the field is to
understand and control the self-organization of active assemblies in space and
time. Most active systems exhibit either spatial order mediated by interactions
that coordinate the spatial structure and the motion of active agents or the
temporal synchronization of individual oscillatory dynamics. The simultaneous
control of spatial and temporal organization is more challenging and generally
requires complex interactions, such as reaction-diffusion hierarchies or
genetically engineered cellular circuits. Here, we report a novel and simple
means to simultaneously control the spatial and temporal self-organization of
bacterial active matter. By confining an active bacterial suspension and
manipulating a single macroscopic parameter, namely the viscoelasticity of the
suspending fluid, we have found that the bacterial fluid first self-organizes
in space into a millimeter-scale rotating vortex; then displays temporal
organization as the giant vortex switches its global chirality periodically
with tunable frequency, reminiscent of a torsional pendulum - a self-driven
one. Combining experiments with an active matter model, we explain this
striking behavior in terms of the interplay between active forcing and
viscoelastic stress relaxation. Our findings advance the understanding of
bacterial behavior in complex fluids, and demonstrate experimentally for the
first time that rheological properties can be harnessed to control active
matter flows. Coupled with actuation, our tunable self-oscillating bacterial
vortex may be used as a ""clock"" for locomotion of soft robots and microfluidic

a non-Abelian (or q-deformed) symmetry, whose eigenspectra are organized as
degenerate multiplets that transform as irreducible representations of the

symmetry, but in a manner that preserves a particular low-entanglement
multiplet of states -- thereby giving generic, thermal spectra with a `shadow'

furnish operators with `spectrum generating algebras' that can be used to lift
the degeneracy of the scar states and promote them to equally spaced `towers'.
Our framework applies to several known models with scars, but we also introduce
new models with scars that transform as irreducible representations of
symmetries such as SU(3) and $q$-deformed SU(2), significantly generalizing the
types of systems known to harbor this phenomenon. Additionally, we present new

measurement choices -- aperture, quenched definition, star formation rate (SFR)

host mass distribution sampling. The definition used to separate quenched and
star-forming galaxies produces differences of up to 70 (30)$\%$ for centrals
(satellites) $>\sim 10^{10.5} M_{\odot}$. Increasing the aperture within which
SFR is measured can suppress the quenched fractions by up to $\sim50\%$,
particularly at $z\gtrsim2$. Proper consideration of the stellar and host mass
distributions is crucial: naive comparisons to volume-limited samples from
simulations lead to misinterpretation of the quenched fractions as a function
of $z$ by up to 20$\%$. Including observational uncertainties to theoretical
values of $M_*$ and SFR changes the quenched fraction values and their trend
and/or slope with mass. Taking projected rather than 3D distances for
satellites decreases the quenched fractions by up to 10$\%$ due to field
contamination. Comparing with data, TNG produces quenched fractions broadly
consistent with observations. TNG predicts quenched fractions up to
$\sim80-90\%$ for centrals at $z\leq2-3$, in line with recent observations, and
notably higher than other theoretical models. The quantitative agreement of TNG

strongly on the galaxy and host mass range. Our mock comparison between TNG and

clustercentric distance and time since infall in the $z=0$ host. Low-mass
centrals ($\lesssim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$), instead, are rarely quenched unless
they become members of groups ($10^{13-14} M_{\odot}$) or clusters
($\geq10^{14} M_{\odot}$), where the quenched fraction rises to $\sim80\%$. The
fraction of low-mass passive galaxies is higher closer to the host center and
for more massive hosts. The population of low-mass satellites accreted
$\gtrsim$4-6 Gyr ago in massive hosts is almost entirely passive, thus
suggesting an upper limit for the time needed for environmental quenching to
occur. In fact, $\sim30\%$ of group and cluster satellites that are quenched at
$z=0$ were already quenched before falling into their current host, and the
bulk of them quenched as early as 4 to 10 billion years ago. For low-mass
galaxies ($\lesssim10^{10-10.5}M_{\odot}$), this is due to preprocessing,
whereby current satellites may have been members of other hosts, and hence have
undergone environmental processes, before falling into their final host, this
mechanism being more common and more effective for the purposes of quenching
for satellites found today in more massive hosts. On the other hand, massive
galaxies quench on their own and because of AGN feedback, regardless of whether
they are centrals or satellites.

density (CSFRD), respectively. The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) is one of the
best future instruments to address this subject due to its high sensitivity and
high-angular resolution. Here, we predict the number of FRBs to be detected

of non-repeating and repeating FRBs separately, based on latest observational
constraints on their physical properties including the spectral indices, FRB
luminosity functions, and their redshift evolutions. We consider two cases of
redshift evolution of FRB luminosity functions following either the CSMD or
CSFRD. At $z\gtrsim2$, $z\gtrsim6$ and $z\gtrsim10$, non-repeating FRBs will be
detected with the SKA at a rate of $\sim10^{4}$, $\sim10^{2}$, and $\sim10$

evolution of their luminosity function is scaled with the CSFRD. These numbers
could change by about one order of magnitude depending on the assumptions on

queries with forced point-spread-function photometry and nightly flux stacking
to increase our sensitivity to faint and fast transients. Automatic queries
yielded $>11,200$ candidates, 24 of which passed quality checks and strict
selection criteria based on a grid of kilonova models tailored for both binary
neutron star and neutron star-black hole mergers. None of the candidates in our
sample was deemed a possible kilonova after thorough vetting, catalog
cross-matching, and study of their color evolution. The sources that passed our
selection criteria are dominated by Galactic cataclysmic variables. In
addition, we identified two fast transients at high Galactic latitude, one of
which is the confirmed afterglow of long-duration GRB190106A, and the other is
a possible cosmological afterglow. Using a survey simulation code, we
constrained the kilonova rate for a range of models including top-hat and

field (ISRF) in galaxies determines the thermal and chemical evolution of the
neutral interstellar gas and is key for interpreting extragalactic observations
and for theories of star-formation. We run a series of galactic disk models and
derive the FUV ISRF intensity as a function of the dust-to-gas ratio,
star-formation rate density, gas density, scale radius, and observer position.
We develop an analytic formula for the median FUV ISRF flux. We identify two
dimensionless parameters in the problem: (1) the dimensionless galactic radius,
$X$, which measures the radial extent of FUV sources (OB stellar associations)
in the disk; (2) the opacity over the inter-source distance, $\tau_{\star}$,
which measures the importance of dust absorption. These parameters encapsulate
the dependence on all of the physical parameters. We find that there exists a
critical $\tau_{\star}$, or equivalently a critical dust-to-gas ratio,
$Z_{d,{\rm crit}}' \approx 0.01-0.1$ the Milky Way value, at which the ISRF
changes behavior. For $Z'_d>Z_{d,{\rm crit}}'$ the ISRF is limited by dust
absorption. With decreasing $Z'_d$, the ISRF intensity increases as more
sources contribute to the flux. For $Z'_d < Z_{d,{\rm crit}}'$ the ISRF
saturates as the disk becomes optically thin. We find that the ISRF per
star-formation rate density in low metallicity systems, such as dwarf and high
redshift galaxies, is higher by up to a factor of 3-6 compared to their
Milky-Way counterparts. We discuss implications to the potential mechanisms

wave signature and the signal sourced by lensing -- is subject to many
contaminants from systematic effects. Of particular concern are systematics
that result in mixing of signals of different ``spin'', particularly leakage
from the much larger spin-0 intensity signal to the spin-2 polarisation signal.
We present a general formalism, which can be applied to arbitrary focal plane
setups, that characterises signals in terms of their spin. We provide general
expressions to describe how spin-coupled signals observed by the detectors
manifest at map-level, in the harmonic domain, and in the power spectra,
focusing on the polarisation spectra -- the signals of interest for upcoming
CMB surveys. We demonstrate the presence of a previously unidentified
cross-term between the systematic and the intrinsic sky signal in the power
spectrum, which in some cases can be the dominant source of contamination. The
formalism is not restricted to intensity to polarisation leakage but provides a
complete elucidation of all leakage including polarisation mixing, and applies
to both full and partial (masked) sky surveys, thus covering space-based,
balloon-borne, and ground-based experiments. Using a pair-differenced setup, we
demonstrate the formalism by using it to completely characterise the effects of
differential gain and pointing systematics, incorporating both intensity
leakage and polarisation mixing. We validate our results with full time ordered
data simulations. Finally, we show in an Appendix that an extension of simple

information regarding galaxy formation and evolution in interacting systems.
Here, we present a detailed study of the extended stellar structure of the SMC
using deep colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), obtained as part of the Survey of
the MAgellanic Stellar History (SMASH). Special care was taken in the
decontamination of our data from MW foreground stars, including from foreground
globular clusters NGC 362 and 47 Tuc. We derived the SMC surface brightness
using a ``conservative'' approach from which we calculated the general
parameters of the SMC, finding a staggered surface brightness profile. We also
traced the fainter outskirts by constructing a stellar density profile. This
approach, based on stellar counts of the oldest main sequence turn-off (MSTO)
stars, uncovered a tidally disrupted stellar feature that reaches as far out as
12 degrees from the SMC centre. We also serendipitously found a faint feature
of unknown origin located at $\sim 14$ degrees from the centre of the SMC and
that we tentatively associated to a more distant structure. We compared our
results to in-house simulations of a $1\times10^{9} M_\odot$ SMC, finding that
its elliptical shape can be explained by its tidal disruption under the
combined presence of the MW and the LMC. Finally, we found that the older
stellar populations show a smooth profile while the younger component presents
a jump in the density followed by a flat profile, confirming the heavily
disturbed nature of the SMC.

classifies representations of the matroid up to rescaling equivalence.
Foundations of matroids are pastures, a simultaneous generalization of partial
fields and hyperfields.
  Using deep results due to Tutte, Dress-Wenzel, and Gelfand-Rybnikov-Stone, we
give a presentation for the foundation of a matroid in terms of generators and
relations. The generators are certain ""cross-ratios"" generalizing the
cross-ratio of four points on a projective line, and the relations encode
dependencies between cross-ratios in certain low-rank configurations arising in
projective geometry.
  Although the presentation of the foundation is valid for all matroids, it is
simplest to apply in the case of matroids without large uniform minors, i.e.
matroids having no minor corresponding to five points on a line or its dual
configuration. For such matroids, we obtain a complete classification of all
possible foundations. We then give a number of applications of this
classification theorem, for example:
  - We prove the following strengthening of a theorem of Lee and Scobee: every
orientation of a matroid without large uniform minors comes from a dyadic
representation, which is unique up to rescaling.
  - For a matroid $M$ without large uniform minors, we establish the following
strengthening of a 2017 theorem of Ardila-Rinc\'on-Williams: if $M$ is
positively oriented then $M$ is representable over every field with at least
three elements.
  - Two matroids are said to belong to the same representation class if they
are representable over precisely the same pastures. We prove that there are
precisely 12 possibilities for the representation class of a matroid without
large uniform minors, exactly three of which are not representable over any
field.

implemented in REDcRAFT is to instead of folding a protein all at the same

residue exits from the generating ribosome. While REDcRAFT exponentially
reduces the problem space so it can be explored in polynomial time, it is still
extremely computationally demanding. This algorithm does have the advantage
that most of the execution time is spent in inherently parallelizable code.
However, preliminary results from parallel execution indicate that
approximately two-thirds of execution time is dedicated to system overhead.
Additionally, by carefully analyzing and timing the structure of the program
the major bottlenecks can be identified. After addressing these issues,
REDcRAFT becomes a scalable parallel application with nearly two orders of

from several different areas. Despite their growing popularity, their
predictive performance is usually affected by the values assigned to their
hyperparameters (HPs). As consequence, researchers and practitioners face the
challenge of how to set these values. Many users have limited knowledge about
ML algorithms and the effect of their HP values and, therefore, do not take
advantage of suitable settings. They usually define the HP values by trial and
error, which is very subjective, not guaranteed to find good values and
dependent on the user experience. Tuning techniques search for HP values able
to maximize the predictive performance of induced models for a given dataset,
but have the drawback of a high computational cost. Thus, practitioners use
default values suggested by the algorithm developer or by tools implementing
the algorithm. Although default values usually result in models with acceptable
predictive performance, different implementations of the same algorithm can
suggest distinct default values. To maintain a balance between tuning and using
default values, we propose a strategy to generate new optimized default values.
Our approach is grounded on a small set of optimized values able to obtain
predictive performance values better than default settings provided by popular
tools. After performing a large experiment and a careful analysis of the
results, we concluded that our approach delivers better default values.
Besides, it leads to competitive solutions when compared to tuned values,
making it easier to use and having a lower cost. We also extracted simple rules
to guide practitioners in deciding whether to use our new methodology or a HP
tuning approach.

MNIST or CIFAR, for which the quality of the labels is high. For the special
case of Gaussian process regression, any positive temperature corresponds to a
valid posterior under a modified prior, and tuning this temperature is directly
analogous to empirical Bayes. On classification tasks, there is no direct
equivalence between modifying the prior and tuning the temperature, however
reducing the temperature can lead to models which better reflect our belief
that one gains little information by relabeling existing examples in the
training set. Therefore although cold posteriors do not always correspond to an
exact inference procedure, we believe they may often better reflect our true
prior beliefs.

richer than in the Majorana case. In the grand canonical ensemble, we identify
a region of small chemical potential, and weak coupling between the two SYKs,
for which two first order thermodynamic phase transitions occur as a function
of temperature. First, we observe a transition from a cold wormhole phase to an
intermediate phase that may correspond to a charged wormhole. For a higher
temperature, there is another first order transition to the black hole phase.
As in the Majorana case, the low temperature wormhole phase is gapped and, for
sufficiently large coupling between the two complex SYK, or chemical potential,
the first order transitions become crossovers. The total charge is good
indicator to study the phase diagram of the model: it is zero in the cold
wormhole phase and jumps discontinuously at the temperatures at which the
transitions take place. Based on the approximate conformal symmetry of the
ground state, expected to be close to a thermofield double state, we identify
the effective low energy action of the model. It is a generalized Schwarzian
action with $SL(2,R)\times U(1)$ symmetry with an additional potential and a
extra degree of freedom related to the charge. In the large $N$ limit, results
from this low energy action are consistent with those from the solution of the
SD equations. Our findings are a preliminary step towards the characterization
of traversable wormholes by its field theory dual, a strongly interacting
fermionic system with charger, that is easier to model experimentally.

characterize its magnetic properties. Neutron diffraction enabled us to
determine the magnetic structure below the known transition temperature

four-sublattice antiferromagnetic structure with two non-collinear Ising axes,

excitation at zero field, consistent with anisotropic (possibly Ising)
exchange. An applied field of 1 T produces a mode softening, which is
consistent with a field-induced second order phase transition. To assess the
relevance of D-Er$_{2}$Si$_{2}$O$_{7}$ to the transverse field Ising model, we
performed AC susceptibility measurements on a single crystal with the magnetic
field oriented in the direction transverse to the Ising axes. This revealed a
transition at 2.65 T at 0.1 K, a field significantly higher than the
mode-softening field observed by powder INS, showing that the field-induced

performance by deliberately injecting malicious samples in the training dataset
to influence the training process. Prior works focus on either availability
attacks (i.e., lowering the overall model accuracy) or integrity attacks (i.e.,
enabling specific instance-based backdoor). In this paper, we advance the
adversarial objectives of the availability attacks to a per-class basis, which
we refer to as class-oriented poisoning attacks. We demonstrate that the
proposed attack is capable of forcing the corrupted model to predict in two
specific ways: (i) classify unseen new images to a targeted ""supplanter"" class,
and (ii) misclassify images from a ""victim"" class while maintaining the
classification accuracy on other non-victim classes. To maximize the
adversarial effect as well as reduce the computational complexity of poisoned
data generation, we propose a gradient-based framework that crafts poisoning
images with carefully manipulated feature information for each scenario. Using
newly defined metrics at the class level, we demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed class-oriented poisoning attacks on various models (e.g., LeNet-5,
Vgg-9, and ResNet-50) over a wide range of datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, and

exposed to opposing opinions. Even if such exposure occurs, the persuasive
effect may be minimal or nonexistent. Recent studies have shown that exposure
to opposing opinions causes a backfire effect, where people become more
steadfast in their original beliefs. We conducted a longitudinal field
experiment on Twitter to test methods that mitigate the backfire effect while
exposing people to opposing opinions. Our subjects were Twitter users with
anti-immigration sentiment. The backfire effect was defined as an increase in
the usage frequency of extreme anti-immigration language in the subjects'
posts. We used automated Twitter accounts, or bots, to apply different
treatments to the subjects. One bot posted only pro-immigration content, which
we refer to as arguing. Another bot initially posted anti-immigration content,
then gradually posted more pro-immigration content, which we refer to as pacing
and leading. We also applied a contact treatment in conjunction with the
messaging based methods, where the bots liked the subjects' posts. We found
that the most effective treatment was a combination of pacing and leading with
contact. The least effective treatment was arguing with contact. In fact,
arguing with contact consistently showed a backfire effect relative to a
control group. These findings have many limitations, but they still have
important implications for the study of political polarization, the backfire
effect, and persuasion in online social networks.

technology. It consists of expensive, centralized generation via large plants,
and a massive transmission and distribution system. It strives to deliver
high-quality power to all subscribers simultaneously - no matter what their

distribution point. Ultimately, the system demands end-to-end synchronization,
and it lacks a mechanism for storing (""buffering"") energy, thus complicating
sharing among grids or independent operation during an ""upstream"" outage.
Recent blackouts demonstrate the existing grid's problems - failures are rare
but spectacular. Moreover, the structure cannot accommodate the highly variable
nature of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind. Many people are
pinning their hopes on the ""smart grid"" - i.e., a more distributed, adaptive,

consumption of electrical energy. This new approach is designed to yield
greater efficiency and resilience, while reducing environmental impact,
compared to the existing electricity distribution system. Initial plans for the

considered how factors including prior beliefs and uncertainty representation
impact such judgements. The present work focuses on the impact of uncertainty
communication when judging bivariate visualizations. Specifically, we model how
users update their beliefs about variable relationships after seeing a
scatterplot with and without uncertainty representation. To model and evaluate
the belief updating, we present three studies. Study 1 focuses on a proposed
''Line + Cone'' visual elicitation method for capturing users' beliefs in an
accurate and intuitive fashion. The findings reveal that our proposed method of
belief solicitation reduces complexity and accurately captures the users'
uncertainty about a range of bivariate relationships. Study 2 leverages the
``Line + Cone'' elicitation method to measure belief updating on the
relationship between different sets of variables when seeing correlation
visualization with and without uncertainty representation. We compare changes
in users beliefs to the predictions of Bayesian cognitive models which provide
normative benchmarks for how users should update their prior beliefs about a
relationship in light of observed data. The findings from Study 2 revealed that
one of the visualization conditions with uncertainty communication led to users
being slightly more confident about their judgement compared to visualization
without uncertainty information. Study 3 builds on findings from Study 2 and
explores differences in belief update when the bivariate visualization is
congruent or incongruent with users' prior belief. Our results highlight the
effects of incorporating uncertainty representation, and the potential of
measuring belief updating on correlation judgement with Bayesian cognitive
models.

allocation of logic resources to modules in a design. At runtime, some of the
occupied resources could be left idle or under-utilized due to hard-to-avoid
sources of inefficiencies (e.g., operation dependencies). With partial
reconfiguration (PR), FPGA resources can be re-allocated over time. Therefore,
using PR, a designer can attempt to reduce idleness and under-utilization with
better area-time scheduling.
  In this paper, we explain when, how, and why PR-style designs can improve
over the performance-area Pareto front of ASIC-style designs (without PR). We
first introduce the concept of area-time volume to explain why PR-style designs
can improve upon ASIC-style designs. We identify resource under-utilization as
an opportunity that can be exploited by PR-style designs. We then present a
first-order analytical model to help a designer decide if a PR-style design can
be beneficial. When it is the case, the model points to the most suitable PR
execution strategy and provides an estimate of the improvement. The model is

equal-brightness pairs at separations as small as 0.08 \arcsec, and
progressively fainter companions are detectable out to $\Delta$ K = 9 mag at a
separation of 2 arcsec. This faint contrast limit due to readnoise continues
out to 10 arcsec near the edge of the detector. We assigned a simple
probability of chance alignment to each companion based upon its separation and
magnitude difference from the central target star and upon areal star counts
for the general star field of Cyg OB2. Companion stars with a field membership
probability of less than 1% are assumed to be physical companions. This
assessment indicates that 47% of the targets have at least one resolved
companion that is probably gravitationally bound. Including known spectroscopic
binaries, our sample includes 27 binary, 12 triple, and 9 systems with four or

designed separately, and serve different purposes. As such, there is often a
diffusion of responsibilities when it comes to ensuring safety for the robot.
We propose that a planner and controller should share the same interpretation
of safety but apply this knowledge in a different yet complementary way. To
achieve this, we use Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability theory at the planning
level to provide the robot planner with the foresight to avoid entering regions
with possible inevitable collision. However, this alone does not guarantee
safety. In conjunction with this HJ reachability-infused planner, we propose a
minimally-interventional multi-agent safety-preserving controller also derived
via HJ-reachability theory. The safety controller maintains safety for the
robot without unduly impacting planner performance. We demonstrate the benefits
of our proposed approach in a multi-agent highway scenario where a robot car is
rewarded to navigate through traffic as fast as possible, and we show that our
approach provides strong safety assurances yet achieves the highest performance
compared to other safety controllers.

different ionization and excitation levels. The upper chromosphere, transition
region, and corona are nearly collisionless. Consequently, slippage between,
for instance, ions and neutral particles, or interactions between separate
species, may play important roles. We have developed a 3D multi-fluid and
multi-species numerical code (Ebysus) to investigate such effects. Ebysus is
capable of treating species (e.g., hydrogen, helium, etc) and fluids (neutrals,
excited and ionized elements) separately, including non-equilibrium ionization,
momentum exchange, radiation, thermal conduction, and other complex processes
in the solar atmosphere. Treating different species as different fluids leads
to drifts between different ions and an electric field that couples these
motions. The coupling for two ionized fluids can lead to an anti-phase
rotational motion between them. Different ionized species and momentum exchange
can dissipate this velocity drift, i.e., convert wave kinetic energy into
thermal energy. High frequency Alfv\'en waves driven by, e.g., reconnection
thought to occur in the solar atmosphere, can drive such multi-ion velocity
drifts.

a curved space with a local coordinate system allows us to detect new hidden
symmetries of the internal motion of a dynamical system, which allows us to
reduce the three-body problem to the 6\emph{th} order system. A new approach
makes the system of geodesic equations with respect to the evolution parameter
of a dynamical system (\emph{internal time}) \emph{fundamentally irreversible}.
To describe the motion of three-body system in different random environments,
the corresponding stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are obtained. Using
these SDEs, Fokker-Planck-type equations are obtained that describe the joint
probability distributions of geodesic flows in phase and configuration spaces.
The paper also formulates the quantum three-body problem in conformal-Euclidean

studying the three-body bound states, as well as for investigating multichannel
quantum scattering in the framework of the concept of internal time. This
allows us to solve the extremely important quantum-classical correspondence

sparse depth points and images of indoor scenes. Specifically, we study the
case in which the sparse depth is computed from a visual-inertial simultaneous
localization and mapping (VI-SLAM) system. The resulting point cloud has low
density, it is noisy, and has non-uniform spatial distribution, as compared to
the input from active depth sensors, e.g., LiDAR or Kinect. Since the VI-SLAM
produces point clouds only over textured areas, we compensate for the missing
depth of the low-texture surfaces by leveraging their planar structures and
their surface normals which is an important intermediate representation. The
pre-trained surface normal network, however, suffers from large performance
degradation when there is a significant difference in the viewing direction
(especially the roll angle) of the test image as compared to the trained ones.
To address this limitation, we use the available gravity estimate from the
VI-SLAM to warp the input image to the orientation prevailing in the training
dataset. This results in a significant performance gain for the surface normal
estimate, and thus the dense depth estimates. Finally, we show that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches both on training (ScanNet and

  Self-Awareness",,,,,"cs.AR cs.SY eess.SY","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Runtime resource management for many-core systems is increasingly complex.
The complexity can be due to diverse workload characteristics with conflicting
demands, or limited shared resources such as memory bandwidth and power.
Resource management strategies for many-core systems must distribute shared
resource(s) appropriately across workloads, while coordinating the high-level
system goals at runtime in a scalable and robust manner.
  To address the complexity of dynamic resource management in many-core
systems, state-of-the-art techniques that use heuristics have been proposed.
These methods lack the formalism in providing robustness against unexpected
runtime behavior. One of the common solutions for this problem is to deploy
classical control approaches with bounds and formal guarantees. Traditional
control theoretic methods lack the ability to adapt to (1) changing goals at
runtime (i.e., self-adaptivity), and (2) changing dynamics of the modeled
system (i.e., self-optimization).
  In this chapter, we explore adaptive resource management techniques that
provide self-optimization and self-adaptivity by employing principles of
computational self-awareness, specifically reflection. By supporting these
self-awareness properties, the system can reason about the actions it takes by
considering the significance of competing objectives, user requirements, and
operating conditions while executing unpredictable workloads.

capture their correlations and retains knowledge about the underlying 3D shape,

STLCG provides a platform which enables the incorporation of logical

can specify spatial and temporal properties of signals generated by both
continuous and hybrid systems. The quantitative semantics of STL provide a
robustness metric, i.e., how much a signal satisfies or violates an STL
specification. In this work, we devise a systematic methodology for translating
STL robustness formulas into computation graphs. With this representation, and
by leveraging off-the-shelf automatic differentiation tools, we are able to
efficiently backpropagate through STL robustness formulas and hence enable a
natural and easy-to-use integration of STL specifications with many

dynamics of an RS ecosystem couple the long-term utility of all agents. In this
work, we explore settings in which content providers cannot remain viable
unless they receive a certain level of user engagement. We formulate the
recommendation problem in this setting as one of equilibrium selection in the
induced dynamical system, and show that it can be solved as an optimal
constrained matching problem. Our model ensures the system reaches an
equilibrium with maximal social welfare supported by a sufficiently diverse set
of viable providers. We demonstrate that even in a simple, stylized dynamical
RS model, the standard myopic approach to recommendation---always matching a
user to the best provider---performs poorly. We develop several scalable
techniques to solve the matching problem, and also draw connections to various
notions of user regret and fairness, arguing that these outcomes are fairer in
a utilitarian sense.

of acoustic segment units covering the overall acoustic scene space. First,
those units are modeled with acoustic segment models (ASMs) used to tokenize
acoustic scene utterances into sequences of acoustic segment units. Next,
paralleling the idea of stop words in information retrieval, stop ASMs are
automatically detected. Finally, acoustic segments associated with the stop
ASMs are blocked, because of their low indexing power in retrieval of most
acoustic scenes. In contrast to building scene models with whole utterances,
the ASM-removed sub-utterances, i.e., acoustic utterances without stop acoustic
segments, are then used as inputs to the AlexNet-L back-end for final
classification. On the DCASE 2018 dataset, scene classification accuracy
increases from 68%, with whole utterances, to 72.1%, with segment selection.
This represents a competitive accuracy without any data augmentation, and/or
ensemble strategy. Moreover, our approach compares favourably to AlexNet-L with

the range of increase in infected cases seven days into the future for all U.S.

features for prediction of the growth of infection. We also analyze pairs of
features and estimate the amount of observed second-order interaction between
them. Experiments show that the proposed model obtains satisfactory predictive
performance and fairly interpretable feature analysis results; hence, the
proposed model could complement the standard epidemiological models for
national-level surveillance of pandemics, such as COVID-19. The results and
findings obtained from the deep learning model could potentially inform
policymakers and researchers in devising effective mitigation and response
strategies. To fast-track further development and experimentation, the code

developed in an effort to improve cancer identification, but current models
localize cancer using MRI-derived features, while failing to consider the

we propose CorrSigNet, an automated two-step model that localizes prostate
cancer on MRI by capturing the pathology features of cancer. First, the model
learns MRI signatures of cancer that are correlated with corresponding
histopathology features using Common Representation Learning. Second, the model
uses the learned correlated MRI features to train a Convolutional Neural
Network to localize prostate cancer. The histopathology images are used only in
the first step to learn the correlated features. Once learned, these correlated
features can be extracted from MRI of new patients (without histopathology or
surgery) to localize cancer. We trained and validated our framework on a unique

prostatectomy surgery. We tested our method on an independent test set of 20

spectral properties of the corresponding single-particle Schr\""odinger
operator. The perturbation theory is in powers of the inverse characteristic
timescale of variation of the fastest varying control parameter, measured in
units of the system timescale, which is set by the smallest eigenvalue of the
corresponding Schr\""odinger operator. It applies to any Brownian system for
which the Schr\""odinger operator has a confining potential. We use the theory
to rigorously derive an exact formula for a Riemannian ""thermodynamic"" metric
in the space of control parameters of the system. We show that up to
second-order terms in the perturbation theory, optimal dissipation-minimizing
driving protocols minimize the length defined by this metric. We also show that
a previously proposed metric is calculable from our exact formula with
corrections that are exponentially suppressed in a characteristic length scale.
We illustrate our formula using the two-dimensional example of a harmonic
oscillator with time-dependent spring constant in a time-dependent electric
field. Lastly, we demonstrate that the Riemannian geometric structure of the

an increasing trend of people substituting regular cloth or surgical masks with
clear plastic face shields, and with masks equipped with exhalation valves. One
of the factors driving this increased adoption is improved comfort compared to
regular masks. However, there is a possibility that widespread public use of
these alternatives to regular masks could have an adverse effect on mitigation
efforts. To help increase public awareness regarding the effectiveness of these
alternative options, we use qualitative visualizations to examine the
performance of face shields and exhalation valves in impeding the spread of
aerosol-sized droplets. The visualizations indicate that although face shields
block the initial forward motion of the jet, the expelled droplets can move
around the visor with relative ease and spread out over a large area depending
on light ambient disturbances. Visualizations for a mask equipped with an
exhalation port indicate that a large number of droplets pass through the
exhale valve unfiltered, which significantly reduces its effectiveness as a
means of source control. Our observations suggest that to minimize the

naturally by a $2^k$ contingency table in which one element -- the number of

absence of additional assumptions, the population size is not identifiable
(i.e. point-identified). Stringent assumptions about the dependence between
samples are often used to achieve point-identification. However, real-world CRC
surveys often use convenience samples in which the assumed dependence cannot be

bootstrap confidence intervals, and profile likelihood confidence intervals.
Simulation results demonstrate well-calibrated confidence sets for each method.

neural text-to-speech (TTS) system. Recently proposed neural excitation
vocoders can realize qualified waveform generation by combining a vocal tract
filter with a WaveNet-based glottal excitation generator. However, when these
vocoders are used in a TTS system, the quality of synthesized speech is often
degraded owing to a mismatch between training and synthesis steps.
Specifically, the vocoder is separately trained from an acoustic model
front-end. Therefore, estimation errors of the acoustic model are inevitably
boosted throughout the synthesis process of the vocoder back-end. To address
this problem, we propose to incorporate an MbG structure into the vocoder's
training process. In the proposed method, the excitation signal is extracted by
the acoustic model's generated spectral parameters, and the neural vocoder is
then optimized not only to learn the target excitation's distribution but also
to compensate for the estimation errors occurring from the acoustic model.
Furthermore, as the generated spectral parameters are shared in the training
and synthesis steps, their mismatch conditions can be reduced effectively. The
experimental results verify that the proposed system provides high-quality
synthetic speech by achieving a mean opinion score of 4.57 within the TTS

Research on this topic is important because relationships are central to a
number of approaches and commonly used by practitioners. In this paper, we
study the notion of relation or relationship in the context of conceptual
modeling. Specifically, we focus on the notion of relationship used in the
entity-relationship (ER) model. The ER model is scrutinized through a new form
of conceptual modeling called the thinging machine (TM) to pursue further
understanding of the semantics of the relationship concept. The ER model is
composed of three fundamental categories (i.e., entity, relationship and
attribute), whereas TM is built from one ontological category called the
thing/machine (thimac). Several ER diagrams are re-casted as TM diagrams,
creating a categorical collision with interesting implications regarding the
status of the conception of relationship in a conceptual model. The re-modeling
shows that the relational construct is dissipated into TM flows of things and
chronology of events.

the context of adversarial machine learning, leading to great recent attention
into this area. One interesting question that has yet to be fully explored is
the bias-variance relationship of adversarial machine learning, which can
potentially provide deeper insights into this behaviour. The notion of bias and
variance is one of the main approaches to analyze and evaluate the
generalization and reliability of a machine learning model. Although it has
been extensively used in other machine learning models, it is not well explored
in the field of deep learning and it is even less explored in the area of
adversarial machine learning.
  In this study, we investigate the effect of adversarial machine learning on
the bias and variance of a trained deep neural network and analyze how
adversarial perturbations can affect the generalization of a network. We derive
the bias-variance trade-off for both classification and regression applications
based on two main loss functions: (i) mean squared error (MSE), and (ii)
cross-entropy. Furthermore, we perform quantitative analysis with both
simulated and real data to empirically evaluate consistency with the derived
bias-variance tradeoffs. Our analysis sheds light on why the deep neural
networks have poor performance under adversarial perturbation from a
bias-variance point of view and how this type of perturbation would change the
performance of a network. Moreover, given these new theoretical findings, we
introduce a new adversarial machine learning algorithm with lower computational
complexity than well-known adversarial machine learning strategies (e.g., PGD)
while providing a high success rate in fooling deep neural networks in lower
perturbation magnitudes.

should update their existing beliefs about a parameter's value in accordance
with the amount of information about the parameter value captured by the new
observations. Extending recent work applying Bayesian models to understand and
evaluate belief updating from visualizations, we show how the predictions of
Bayesian inference can be used to guide more rational belief updating. We
design a Bayesian inference-assisted uncertainty analogy that numerically
relates uncertainty in observed data to the user's subjective uncertainty, and
a posterior visualization that prescribes how a user should update their
beliefs given their prior beliefs and the observed data. In a pre-registered
experiment on 4,800 people, we find that when a newly observed data sample is
relatively small (N=158), both techniques reliably improve people's Bayesian
updating on average compared to the current best practice of visualizing
uncertainty in the observed data. For large data samples (N=5208), where
people's updated beliefs tend to deviate more strongly from the prescriptions
of a Bayesian model, we find evidence that the effectiveness of the two forms
of Bayesian assistance may depend on people's proclivity toward trusting the
source of the data. We discuss how our results provide insight into individual
processes of belief updating and subjective uncertainty, and how understanding
these aspects of interpretation paves the way for more sophisticated

  Carlo Tree Search",,,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Stream processing engines enable modern systems to conduct large-scale
analytics over unbounded data streams in real time. They often view an
application as a direct acyclic graph with streams flowing through pipelined
instances of various processing units. One key challenge that emerges is
instance placement, i.e., to decide the placement of instances across servers
with minimum traffic across servers and maximum resource utilization. The
challenge roots in not only its intrinsic complexity but also the impact
between successive application deployments. Most updated engines such as Apache
Heron exploits a more modularized scheduler design that decomposes the task
into two stages: One decides the instance-to-container mapping while the other
focuses on the container-to-server mapping that is delegated to standalone
resource managers. The unaligned objectives and scheduler designs in the two
stages may lead to long response times or low utilization. However, so far
little work has appeared to address the challenge. Inspired by the recent
success of applications of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods in various
fields, we develop a novel model to characterize such systems, formulate the
problem, and cast each stage of mapping into a sequential decision process. By
adopting MCTS methods, we propose MIPS, an MCTS-based Instance Placement Scheme
to decide the two-staged mapping in a timely yet efficient manner. In addition,
we discuss practical issues and refine MIPS to further improve its performance.
Results from extensive simulations show, given mild-value of samples, MIPS
outperforms existing schemes with a significant traffic reduction and
utilization improvement. To our best knowledge, this paper is the first to
study the two-staged mapping problem and to apply MCTS to solving the
challenge.

signaling, proposed in the 1970s, is a promising paradigm for improving
spectrum utilization. This paper proposes intelligent variable-packing-ratio
(VPR)-based transmissions for high spectrum efficiency (SE) and security,
respectively. Aided by deep learning (DL)-based estimation, the proposed scheme
for high SE can achieve a higher capacity with negligible modification to
existing communication paradigms (e.g., spectrum allocation or frame

scheme is proposed to produce randomly distributed positions to switch the
packing ratio, which can effectively avoid detections and attacks. In addition,
we propose a simplified DL-based packing ratio estimation for both of these two
scenarios so that the receiver can estimate the packing ratio without any
in-band or out-band control messages. Simulation results show that the proposed
simplified estimation achieves nearly the same accuracy and convergence speed
as the original multi-branch fully-connected structure with a complexity
reduction of 20 folds. Finally, we derive the closed-form SE of the proposed
VPR transmission under different channels. The numerical results validate the
correctness of the derivation and demonstrate the SE gains of the VPR scheme

spectral embedding of multiple independent networks can deliver more accurate
estimation than individual spectral decompositions of those same networks. Such
inference procedures typically rely heavily on independence assumptions across
the multiple network realizations, and even in this case, little attention has
been paid to the induced network correlation in such joint embeddings. Here, we
present a generalized omnibus embedding methodology and provide a detailed
analysis of this embedding across both independent and correlated networks, the
latter of which significantly extends the reach of such procedures. We describe
how this omnibus embedding can itself induce correlation, leading us to
distinguish between inherent correlation -- the correlation that arises
naturally in multisample network data -- and induced correlation, which is an
artifice of the joint embedding methodology. We show that the generalized
omnibus embedding procedure is flexible and robust, and prove both consistency
and a central limit theorem for the embedded points. We examine how induced and
inherent correlation can impact inference for network time series data, and we
provide network analogues of classical questions such as the effective sample
size for more generally correlated data. Further, we show how an appropriately
calibrated generalized omnibus embedding can detect changes in real biological
networks that previous embedding procedures could not discern, confirming that
the effect of inherent and induced correlation can be subtle and
transformative, with import in theory and practice.

information to undermine the team objective. We propose two distributed
algorithms where each agent maintains and updates two sets of beliefs (i.e.,
probability distributions over the hypotheses), namely local and actual beliefs
(LB and AB respectively for brevity). In both algorithms, at every time step,
each agent shares its AB with other agents within its communication range and
makes a local observation to update its LB. Then both algorithms can use the
shared information to update ABs under certain conditions. One requires
receiving a certain number of shared ABs at each time instant; the other
accumulates shared ABs over time and updates after the number of shared ABs
exceeds a prescribed threshold. Otherwise, both algorithms rely on the agent's
current LB and AB to update the new AB. We prove under mild assumptions that
the AB for every non-compromised agent converges almost surely to the true
hypothesis, without requiring connectivity in the underlying time-varying
network topology. Using a simulation of a team of unmanned aerial vehicles

stability and the difference in vibrational entropy which, within the Debye

functional theory together with special quasi-random structures to study the
elastic properties of disordered martensite and austenite Ti-Ta alloys as a
function of composition. We observe a softening in the tetragonal shear elastic
constant of the austenite phase at low Ta content and a \emph{non-linear}
behavior in the shear elastic constant of the martensite. A minimum of 12.5$\%$
Ta is required to stabilize the austenite phase at $T = 0$ K. Further, the
shear elastic constants and Young's modulus of martensite exhibit a maximum for
Ta concentrations close to 30$\%$. Phenomenological, elastic-constant-based
criteria suggest that the addition of Ta enhances the strength, but reduces the
ductile character of the alloys. In addition, the directional elastic
stiffness, calculated for both martensite and austenite, becomes more isotropic
with increasing Ta content. The reported trends in elastic properties as a
function of composition may serve as a guide in the design of alloys with
optimized properties in this interesting class of materials.

great success on data-sufficient segments, it may fail in a large-portion of
segments in E-commerce platforms, where there are not sufficient records to
learn well-trained models. In this paper, we tackle this problem in the context
of market segment demand prediction. The goal is to facilitate the learning
process in the target segments by leveraging the learned knowledge from
data-sufficient source segments. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithm,
RMLDP, to incorporate a multi-pattern fusion network (MPFN) with a
meta-learning paradigm. The multi-pattern fusion network considers both local
and seasonal temporal patterns for segment demand prediction. In the
meta-learning paradigm, transferable knowledge is regarded as the model
parameter initialization of MPFN, which are learned from diverse source
segments. Furthermore, we capture the segment relations by combining
data-driven segment representation and segment knowledge graph representation
and tailor the segment-specific relations to customize transferable model
parameter initialization. Thus, even with limited data, the target segment can
quickly find the most relevant transferred knowledge and adapt to the optimal
parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale industrial
datasets. The results justify that our RMLDP outperforms a set of
state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, RMLDP has been deployed in Taobao, a
real-world E-commerce platform. The online A/B testing results further

and resource theory. This interplay consequently serves as a potential platform
for interdisciplinary studies. To continue this line, we analyze the role of
dynamical resources in a communication setup, and further apply our analysis to
thermodynamics. To start with, we study classical communication scenarios
constrained by a given resource, in the sense that the information processing
channel is unable to supply additional amounts of the resource. We show that
the one-shot classical capacity is upper bounded by resource preservability,
which is a measure of the ability to preserve the resource. A lower bound can
be further obtained when the resource is asymmetry. As an application,
unexpectedly, under a recently-studied thermalization model, we found that the
smallest bath size needed to thermalize all outputs of a Gibbs-preserving
coherence-annihilating channel upper bounds its one-shot classical capacity.
When the channel is coherence non-generating, the upper bound is given by a sum
of coherence preservability and the bath size of the channel's incoherent
version. In this sense, bath sizes can be interpreted as the thermodynamic cost
of transmitting classical information. This finding provides a dynamical
analogue of Landauer's principle, and therefore bridges classical communication
and thermodynamics. As another implication, we show that, in bipartite
settings, classically correlated local baths can admit classical communication
even when both local systems are completely thermalized. Hence, thermalizations
can transmit information by accessing only classical correlation as a resource.
Our results demonstrate interdisciplinary applications enabled by dynamical
resource theory.

contrastive action learning paradigm named AS-CAL that can leverage different
augmentations of unlabeled skeleton data to learn action representations in an
unsupervised manner. Specifically, we first propose to contrast similarity
between augmented instances (query and key) of the input skeleton sequence,
which are transformed by multiple novel augmentation strategies, to learn
inherent action patterns (""pattern-invariance"") of different skeleton
transformations. Second, to encourage learning the pattern-invariance with more
consistent action representations, we propose a momentum LSTM, which is
implemented as the momentum-based moving average of LSTM based query encoder,
to encode long-term action dynamics of the key sequence. Third, we introduce a
queue to store the encoded keys, which allows our model to flexibly reuse
proceeding keys and build a more consistent dictionary to improve contrastive
learning. Last, by temporally averaging the hidden states of action learned by
the query encoder, a novel representation named Contrastive Action Encoding

real-world SISR from the perspective of the camera and smartphone. However,

original ground truths from the previous DIV2K dataset and corresponding LR
images are camera-captured versions of HRs displayed on the screen. We conduct
extensive experiments to demonstrate that involving more real degradations is
positive to improve the generalization of SISR models. Moreover, we propose a
joint two-stage model. Firstly, the downsampling degradation GAN(DD-GAN) is
trained to model the degradation and produces more various of LR images, which
is validated to be efficient for data augmentation. Then the dual residual
channel attention network (DuRCAN) learns to recover the SR image. The weighted
combination of L1 loss and proposed Laplacian loss are applied to sharpen the
high-frequency edges. Extensive experimental results in both typical synthetic

better visual results. Moreover, in real captured photographs, our model also
delivers best visual quality with sharper edge, less artifacts, especially

Several acoustic features are then used to extract fixed length embeddings of

our approach with previous deep learning architectures, and study the effect of
motivic patterns and acoustic features in the identification task. Results

stratified ($N^2/(2\Omega)^2<1$), however, waves can survive at any latitude if
the meridional wavenumber is large. Then we have discussed transmission ratios

it is called full superregular and these matrices are used to construct Maximum
Distance Separable block codes. In the context of convolutional codes, lower

{full-duplex (FD) radio} is adopted at the UAV to overcome these challenges. In
addition, half-duplex (HD) scheme for UAV-based relaying is also considered to
provide a comparative study between two modes (viz., FD and HD). {Herein, a
device is considered to be successfully served iff its data is collected by the
UAV and conveyed to GW timely during flight time}. In this context, we aim to
maximize the number of served IoT devices by jointly optimizing bandwidth,
power allocation, and the UAV trajectory while satisfying each device's

Reynolds number $Re = \rho U_{max} H/\eta$, the elasticity number $E = \lambda

here, $\lambda$ is the polymer relaxation time, $H$ is the channel half-width,
and $\rho$ is the fluid density. For experimentally relevant values (e.g., $E
\sim 0.1$ and $\beta \sim 0.9$), the predicted critical Reynolds number,
$Re_c$, for the center-mode instability is around $200$, with the associated
eigenmodes being spread out across the channel. In the asymptotic limit of $E(1

shown that applying classical logistic regression with elastic-net penalty to
these datasets can lead to poor results (Liu et al., 2018). We implement a
two-step approach to multi-omic logistic regression in which variable selection
is performed on each layer separately and a predictive model is then built
using the variables selected in the first step. Here, our approach is compared
to other methods that have been developed for the same purpose, and we adapt
existing software for multi-omic linear regression (Zhao and Zucknick, 2020) to
the logistic regression setting. Extensive simulation studies show that our
approach should be preferred if the goal is to select as many relevant
predictors as possible, as well as achieving prediction performances comparable
to those of the best competitors. Our motivating example is a cardiometabolic

the interface between BCS superconductors and other materials. The detection of
odd-$\omega$ pairs, which are necessarily non-local in time, is still an open
problem. The main reason is that they do not contribute to static measurements
described by time-local correlation functions. Therefore, dynamical
measurements, which depend on non-local time correlations, are suitable for
detecting these pairs. In this work, we study the signatures of odd-$\omega$
pairs in the supercurrent noise through a weak link between two superconductors
at different superconducting phases. We show that the finite frequency current
noise can be decomposed into three different contributions coming from even
frequency (even-$\omega$), odd-$\omega$ pair amplitudes, and electron-hole
correlation functions. Odd-$\omega$ pairing, which is inter-lead (between
electrons at different sides of the junction), provides a positive contribution
to the noise, becoming maximal at a superconducting phase difference of $\pi$.
In contrast, intra-lead even-$\omega$ pair amplitude tends to reduce the noise,
except for a region close to $\pi$, controlled by the transmission of the
junction.

originates interpolation polynomials at Chebyshev zeros by using de la Vall\'ee
Poussin filters. These polynomials can be an useful device for many theoretical
and applicative problems since they combine the advantages of the classical
Lagrange interpolation, with the uniform convergence in spaces of locally
continuous functions equipped with suitable, Jacobi--weighted, uniform norms.
The uniform boundedness of the related Lebesgue constants, which equals to the
uniform convergence and is missing from Lagrange interpolation, has been
already proved in literature under different, but only sufficient, assumptions.
Here, we state the necessary and sufficient conditions to get it. These
conditions are easy to check since they are simple inequalities on the
exponents of the Jacobi weight defining the norm. Moreover, they are necessary
and sufficient to get filtered interpolating polynomials with a near best
approximation error, which tends to zero as the number $n$ of nodes tends to
infinity. In addition, the convergence rate is comparable with the error of
best polynomial approximation of degree $n$, hence the approximation order
improves with the smoothness of the sought function. Several numerical
experiments are given in order to test the theoretical results, to make a
comparison with the Lagrange interpolation at the same nodes and to show how
the Gibbs phenomenon can be strongly reduced.

macroscopic scale, atomic degrees of freedom are equilibrated and can be probed
in a reproducible way. A clear signature of the VPT is present as a sharp drop
of the mean square displacement of PNIPAM hydrogen atoms obtained by neutron
scattering. As a function of concentration, the VPT gets smoother as dry
conditions are approached whereas the VPT temperature shows a minimum at about
43~wt\%. This behavior is qualitatively confirmed by calorimetry measurements.
Molecular dynamics simulations are employed to complement experimental results
and gain further insights into the nature of the VPT, confirming that it
involves the formation of an attractive gel state between the microgels.
Overall, these results provide evidence that the VPT in PNIPAM-based systems
can be detected at different time- and length-scales as well as in overcrowded

the shadow of future, but it is hard to maintain cooperation when a large
number of error-prone individuals are involved. One way to construct a
cooperative Nash equilibrium is to find a `friendly-rivalry' strategy, which
aims at full cooperation but never allows the co-players to be better off.
Recently it has been shown that for the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma in the
presence of error, a friendly rival can be designed with the following five
rules: Cooperate if everyone did, accept punishment for your own mistake,
punish defection, recover cooperation if you find a chance, and defect in all
the other circumstances. In this work, we construct such a friendly-rivalry
strategy for the iterated $n$-person public-goods game by generalizing those
five rules. The resulting strategy makes a decision with referring to the
previous $m=2n-1$ rounds. A friendly-rivalry strategy for $n=2$ inherently has
evolutionary robustness in the sense that no mutant strategy has higher
fixation probability in this population than that of a neutral mutant. Our
evolutionary simulation indeed shows excellent performance of the proposed
strategy in a broad range of environmental conditions when $n= 2$ and $3$.

paper addresses a class of constrained distributed nonconvex optimization
problems involving univariate objectives, aiming to achieve global optimization
without requiring local evaluations of gradients at every iteration. We propose
a novel algorithm named CPCA, exploiting the notion of combining Chebyshev

approximations via average consensus, and turn to solve an easier approximate
version of the original problem. Due to the nice analytic properties owned by
polynomials, this approximation not only facilitates efficient global
optimization, but also allows the design of gradient-free iterations to reduce
cumulative costs of queries and achieve geometric convergence when nonconvex

quantum geometry of its eigenstates, and demonstrate its intimate connection
with a quantity we call the dipole curvature. The dipole curvature arises
naturally in semiclassical dynamics of an exciton in an electric field, adding
a term additional to the anomalous velocity coming from the Berry's curvature.
In a uniform electric field this contributes a drift velocity akin to that
expected for excitons in crossed electric and magnetic fields, even in the
absence of a real magnetic field. We compute the quantities relevant to
semiclassical exciton dynamics for several interesting examples of bilayer
systems with weak interlayer tunneling and Fermi energy in a gap, where the
exciton may be sensibly described as a two-body problem. These quantities
include the exciton dispersion, its dipole curvature, and Berry's curvature.
For two gapped-graphene layers in a vanishing magnetic field, we find the
dipole curvature vanishes if the layers are identical, but may be non-zero when
the layers differ. We further analyze examples in the presence of magnetic
fields, allowing us to examine cases involving graphene, in which a gap is
opened by Landau level splitting. Heterostructures involving TMDs are also
considered. In each case the dipole and/or Berry's curvatures play out
differently. In some cases, the lowest energy exciton state is found to reside
at finite momentum, with interesting possibilities for Bose condensation. We
also find situations in which the dipole curvature increases monotonically with
exciton momentum, suggesting that the quantum geometry can be exploited to
produce photocurrents from initially bound excitons with electric fields. We
speculate on further possible effects of the semiclassical dynamics in
geometries where the constituent layers are subject to the same or different
electric fields.

and for different purposes, the study of biomolecular oscillations can lead to
different clues about the mechanisms underlying living cells. It is known that
network-level interactions involve more than one type of biomolecule as well as
biological processes operating at multiple omic levels. Combining
network/pathway-level information with genetic information it is possible to
describe well-understood or unknown bacterial mechanisms and organism-specific
dynamics. Results: Network multi-omic integration has led to the discovery of
interesting oscillatory signals. Following the methodologies used in signal
processing and communication engineering, a new methodology is introduced to
identify and quantify the extent of the multi-omic oscillations of the signal.
New signal metrics are designed to allow further biotechnological explanations
and provide important clues about the oscillatory nature of the pathways and
their regulatory circuits. Our algorithms designed for the analysis of
multi-omic signals are tested and validated on 11 different bacteria for
thousands of multi-omic signals perturbed at the network level by different
experimental conditions. Information on the order of genes, codon usage, gene
expression, and protein molecular weight is integrated at three different

evolutionary relations along with taxa.

study is the log-rank conjecture for XOR functions and its connection to
Fourier analysis and parity decision tree complexity. Let f be a Boolean
function with Fourier support S and Fourier sparsity k.
  1) We prove via the probabilistic method that there exists a parity decision
tree of depth O(sqrt k) that computes f. This matches the best known upper
bound on the parity decision tree complexity of Boolean functions (Tsang, Wong,
Xie, and Zhang, FOCS 2013). Moreover, while previous constructions (Tsang et
al., FOCS 2013, Shpilka, Tal, and Volk, Comput. Complex. 2017) build the trees
by carefully choosing the parities to be queried in each step, our proof shows
that a naive sampling of the parities suffices.
  2) We generalize the above result by showing that if the Fourier spectra of
Boolean functions satisfy a natural ""folding property"", then the above proof
can be adapted to establish existence of a tree of complexity polynomially
smaller than O(sqrt k). We make a conjecture in this regard which, if true,
implies that the communication complexity of an XOR function is bounded above
by the fourth root of the rank of its communication matrix, improving upon the
previously known upper bound of square root of rank (Tsang et al., FOCS 2013,
Lovett, J. ACM. 2016).
  3) It can be shown by elementary techniques that for any Boolean function f
and all pairs (alpha, beta) of parities in S, there exists another pair (gamma,
delta) of parities in S such that alpha + beta = gamma + delta. We show, among
other results, that there must exist several gamma in F_2^n such that there are
at least three pairs (alpha_1, alpha_2) of parities in S with alpha_1 + alpha_2
= gamma.

enhancements of the Lyman series, potentially affecting power balance in the

separation of the $Ly\beta$ and $Ly\alpha$ emission regions. This may have
implications for the treatment and diagnosis of divertor opacity. The
demonstrated enhancement of the Balmer series through plasma-molecule processes
potentially poses a challenge to using the Balmer series for understanding and
diagnosing detachment based only on atom-plasma processes.

frequently cause developers to make mistakes when re-using third-party
implementations. Such API misuses can result in unintended behavior,
performance losses, or software crashes. Therefore, current research aims to
automatically detect such misuses by comparing the way a developer used an API
to previously inferred patterns of the correct API usage. While research has
made significant progress, these techniques have not yet been adopted in
practice. In part, this is due to the lack of a process capable of seamlessly
integrating with software development processes. Particularly, existing
approaches do not consider how to collect relevant source code samples from
which to infer patterns. In fact, an inadequate collection can cause API usage
pattern miners to infer irrelevant patterns which leads to false alarms instead
of finding true API misuses. In this paper, we target this problem (a) by
providing a method that increases the likelihood of finding relevant and
true-positive patterns concerning a given set of code changes and agnostic to a
concrete static, intra-procedural mining technique and (b) by introducing a
concept for just-in-time API misuse detection which analyzes changes at the
time of commit. Particularly, we introduce different, lightweight code search
and filtering strategies and evaluate them on two real-world API misuse
datasets to determine their usefulness in finding relevant intra-procedural API
usage patterns. Our main results are (1) commit-based search with subsequent
filtering effectively decreases the amount of code to be analyzed, (2) in
particular method-level filtering is superior to file-level filtering, (3)
project-internal and project-external code search find solutions for different
types of misuses and thus are complementary, (4) incorporating prior knowledge

The device parameters are optimized using both TCAD simulations and analytical

structure is found to be highly sensitive to the device dimensions and the
dielectric constant of the insulator. The aspect ratio, which is the ratio of
the length to the width of the drift region, is found to be the most important
parameter in designing the structure and the proposed approach only works for
aspect ratio much greater than one. The width of the dielectric layer and the
dielectric constant also plays a crucial role in improving the device
properties and are optimized to achieve maximum figure of merit. Using the
optimized structure with an aspect ratio of 10 and a dielectric constant of
300, the structure is predicted to surpass the b-Ga2O3 unipolar figure of merit
by four times indicating the promise of such structures for exceptional FOM

features of the climate system that make it challenging. Based on pedagogical
experiments in an undergraduate physics classroom for non-science majors, I
identify five general barriers to teaching climate change, and formulate four
dimensions of an effective climate pedagogy: the scientific-technological, the
transdisciplinary, the onto-epistemological, and the psychosocial action
dimensions. Within the context of a collaborative classroom culture informed by
transformational learning, I describe the use of a meta-conceptual framework
that, along with the issue of climate justice, seeks to realize all four
dimensions of an effective climate pedagogy. This broad holistic framework is
potentially adaptable to contexts and disciplines beyond undergraduate physics.

$(m_\partial,w_\partial)$ consists of the number $m_\partial$ of marked points

set of chores (bads) among themselves fairly and efficiently. We assume that
agents have linear disutility (cost) functions. Like for the case of goods,
competitive division is known to be arguably the best mechanism for the bads as
well. However, unlike goods, there are multiple competitive divisions with very
different disutility value profiles in bads. Although all competitive divisions
satisfy the standard notions of fairness and efficiency, some divisions are
significantly fairer and efficient than the others. This raises two important
natural questions: Does there exist a competitive division in which no agent is
assigned a chore that she hugely dislikes? Are there simple sufficient
conditions for the existence and polynomial-time algorithms assuming them?
  We investigate both these questions in this paper. We show that the first
problem is strongly NP-hard. Further, we derive a simple sufficient condition
for the existence, and we show that finding a competitive division is PPAD-hard
assuming the condition. These results are in sharp contrast to the case of
goods where both problems are strongly polynomial-time solvable. To the best of
our knowledge, these are the first hardness results for the chore division
problem, and, in fact, for any economic model under linear preferences.

termed wake steering, has demonstrated potential as a collective control
approach for wind farm power maximization. The optimal control strategy, and
resulting effect of wake steering on wind farm power production, are in part
dictated by the power degradation of the upwind yaw misaligned wind turbines.
In the atmospheric boundary layer, the wind speed and direction may vary
significantly over the wind turbine rotor area, depending on atmospheric
conditions and stability, resulting in freestream turbine power production
which is asymmetric as a function of the direction of yaw misalignment and
which varies during the diurnal cycle. In this study, we propose a model for
the power production of a wind turbine in yaw misalignment based on aerodynamic
blade elements which incorporates the effects of wind speed and direction
changes over the turbine rotor area in yaw misalignment. A field experiment is
performed using multiple utility-scale wind turbines to characterize the power
production of yawed freestream operating turbines depending on the wind
conditions, and the model is validated using the experimental data. The
resulting power production of a yaw misaligned variable speed wind turbine
depends on a nonlinear interaction between the yaw misalignment, the

prediction models have been developed, but they often give predictions with
conflicting clinical implications. Integrating information from different
models may improve the accuracy of risk predictions, which would be valuable
for both clinicians and patients. BRCAPRO and BCRAT are two widely used models
based on largely complementary sets of risk factors. BRCAPRO is a Bayesian
model that uses detailed family history information to estimate the probability
of carrying a BRCA1/2 mutation, as well as future risk of breast and ovarian
cancer, based on mutation prevalence and penetrance (age-specific probability
of developing cancer given genotype). BCRAT uses a relative hazard model based
on first-degree family history and non-genetic risk factors. We consider two
approaches for combining BRCAPRO and BCRAT: 1) modifying the penetrance
functions in BRCAPRO using relative hazard estimates from BCRAT, and 2)
training an ensemble model that takes as input BRCAPRO and BCRAT predictions.
We show that the combination models achieve performance gains over BRCAPRO and
BCRAT in simulations and data from the Cancer Genetics Network.

present a model to support the cooperative aspect in the EC infrastructure. We
argue on the delivery of data synopses to EC nodes making them capable to take
offloading decisions fully aligned with data present at peers. Nodes exchange
data synopses to inform their peers. We propose a scheme that detects the
appropriate time to distribute synopses trying to avoid the network overloading

which they generalize to unforeseen source code is largely unknown. Since it is
very challenging to test neural program models on all unforeseen programs, in
this paper, we propose to evaluate the generalizability of neural program
models with respect to semantic-preserving transformations: a generalizable
neural program model should perform equally well on programs that are of the
same semantics but of different lexical appearances and syntactical structures.
We compare the results of various neural program models for the method name

transformations. We use three Java datasets of different sizes and three
state-of-the-art neural network models for code, namely code2vec, code2seq, and
GGNN, to build nine such neural program models for evaluation. Our results show
that even with small semantically preserving changes to the programs, these
neural program models often fail to generalize their performance. Our results
also suggest that neural program models based on data and control dependencies
in programs generalize better than neural program models based only on abstract
syntax trees. On the positive side, we observe that as the size of the training
dataset grows and diversifies the generalizability of correct predictions
produced by the neural program models can be improved too. Our results on the
generalizability of neural program models provide insights to measure their

attempt to reconstruct electrical excitation or action potential wave patterns
from the heart's mechanical deformation that occurs in response to electrical

to the excitation-contraction coupling mechanism, the resulting deformation of
the heart should reflect macroscopic action potential wave phenomena. However,
whether the relationship between macroscopic electrical and mechanical
phenomena is well-defined and furthermore unique enough to be utilized for an
inverse imaging technique, in which mechanical activation mapping is used as a
surrogate for electrical mapping, has yet to be determined. Here, we provide a
numerical proof-of-principle that deep learning can be used to solve the
inverse mechano-electrical problem in phenomenological two- and
three-dimensional computer simulations of the contracting heart wall, or in
elastic excitable media, with muscle fiber anisotropy. We trained a
convolutional autoencoder neural network to learn the complex relationship
between electrical excitation, active stress, and tissue deformation during
both focal or reentrant chaotic wave activity, and consequently used the
network to succesfully estimate or reconstruct electrical excitation wave
patterns from mechanical deformation in sheets and bulk-shaped tissues, even in
the presence of noise and at low spatial resolutions. We demonstrate that even
complicated three-dimensional electrical excitation wave phenomena, such as
scroll waves and their vortex filaments, can be computed with very high
reconstruction accuracies of about 95% from mechanical deformation using
autoencoder neural networks, and we provide a comparison with results that were
obtained previously with a physics- or knowledge-based approach.

In practice, statistics of such uncertainties are unattainable and need to be

that aims to minimize time-average system costs and ensure queue stability. By

that the epidemic between March 13, 2020 and May 22, 2020 was simply
rate-limited by the three constant-parameters: the initial susceptible, domain
growth rate, and nucleation decay constant. This model provides a good
predictor of the epidemic because it consists of one equation and the initial

question, how can we organize and prioritize them in order to determine the
preferred ones based on preference comparisons by crowd evaluators? As there
are diverse latent criteria for the value of an idea, multiple ideas can be
considered as ""the best"". In addition, evaluators can have different preference
criteria, and their comparison results often disagree.
  In this paper, we propose an analysis method for obtaining a subset of ideas,
which we call frontier ideas, that are the best in terms of at least one latent
evaluation criterion. We propose an approach, called CrowDEA, which estimates
the embeddings of the ideas in the multiple-criteria preference space, the best
viewpoint for each idea, and preference criterion for each evaluator, to obtain
a set of frontier ideas. Experimental results using real datasets containing
numerous ideas or designs demonstrate that the proposed approach can
effectively prioritize ideas from multiple viewpoints, thereby detecting
frontier ideas. The embeddings of ideas learned by the proposed approach
provide a visualization that facilitates observation of the frontier ideas. In
addition, the proposed approach prioritizes ideas from a wider variety of
viewpoints, whereas the baselines tend to use to the same viewpoints; it can
also handle various viewpoints and prioritize ideas in situations where only a
limited number of evaluators or labels are available.

model for New York City, called MATSim-NYC, to support agencies in evaluating
policies such as congestion pricing. The simulation-based virtual test bed is
loaded with an 8M+ synthetic 2016 population calibrated in a prior study. The
road network is calibrated to INRIX speed data and average annual daily traffic
for a screenline along the East River crossings, resulting in average speed
differences of 7.2% on freeways and 17.1% on arterials, leading to average
difference of +1.8% from the East River screenline. Validation against transit
stations shows an 8% difference from observed counts and median difference of
29% for select road link counts. The model is used to evaluate a congestion
pricing plan proposed by the Regional Plan Association and suggests a much
higher (127K) car trip reduction compared to their report (59K). The pricing
policy would impact the population segment making trips within Manhattan
differently from the population segment of trips outside Manhattan. The
multiagent simulation can show that 37.3% of the Manhattan segment would be
negatively impacted by the pricing compared to 39.9% of the non-Manhattan
segment, which has implications for redistribution of congestion pricing
revenues. The citywide travel consumer surplus decreases when the congestion
pricing goes up from $9.18 to $14 both ways even as it increases for the
Charging-related population segment. This implies that increasing pricing from
$9.18 to $14 benefits Manhattanites at the expense of the rest of the city.

solvers for which an MPI rank offloads the source term computation task for a

here is optimal for GPU environments as-is, this interpretation allows the user
to replace portions of the exact routine with trained, so-called approximate

this paper is not to use machine learning for developing models, but rather to
