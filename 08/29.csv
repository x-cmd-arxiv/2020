presence of selection bias, assuming the treatment effect on selection has the
same sign for all subjects. This paper generalizes Lee bounds to allow the sign
of this effect to be identified by pretreatment covariates, relaxing the
standard (unconditional) monotonicity to its conditional analog. Asymptotic
theory for generalized Lee bounds is proposed in low-dimensional smooth and
high-dimensional sparse designs. The paper also generalizes Lee bounds to
accommodate multiple outcomes. It characterizes the sharp identified set for
the causal parameter and proposes uniform Gaussian inference on the support
function. The estimated bounds achieve nearly point-identification in JobCorps
job training program (Lee (2009)), where unconditional monotonicity is unlikely
to hold.

lives due to viral information propagation regardless of its veracity. Some
information cascades turn out to be viral since they circulated rapidly on the
Internet. The uncontrollable virality of manipulated or disorientated true
information (fake news) might be quite harmful, while the spread of the true
news is advantageous, especially in emergencies. We tackle the problem of
predicting information cascades by presenting a novel variant of SEIZ
(Susceptible/ Exposed/ Infected/ Skeptics) model that outperforms the original
version by taking into account the cognitive processing depth of users. We
define an information cascade as the set of social media users' reactions to
the original content which requires at least minimal physical and cognitive
effort; therefore, we considered retweet/ reply/ quote (mention) activities and
tested our framework on the Syrian White Helmets Twitter data set from April
1st, 2018 to April 30th, 2019. In the prediction of cascade pattern via
traditional compartmental models, all the activities are grouped, and their
summation is taken into account; however, transition rates between compartments
should vary according to the activity type since their requirements of physical
and cognitive efforts are not same. Based on this assumption, we design a
cognition-driven SEIZ (CD-SEIZ) model in the prediction of information cascades
on Twitter. We tested SIS, SEIZ, and CD-SEIZ models on 1000 Twitter cascades
and found that CD-SEIZ has a significantly low fitting error and provides a
statistically more accurate estimation.

data visualization. However, the availability of the latter is generally
restricted to PCs with the Linux operating system. Thus, users that want to see
what is happening in the system with a smartphone or a tablet are stuck with

are difficult to interact with from a mobile interface. More importantly, this
makes newer visualization modalities such as Augmented Reality impossible. Our

providing a visualization platform designed from scratch to be usable in mobile

  Graphs, which provide effective ways to represent pairwise interactions among
entities, fail to represent group interactions (e.g., collaboration of three or
more researchers, etc.). Regarded as a generalization of graphs, hypergraphs
allowing for various sizes of edges prove fruitful in addressing this
limitation. The increased complexity, however, makes it challenging to
understand hypergraphs as thoroughly as graphs.
  In this work, we closely examine seven structural and dynamical properties of
real hypergraphs from six domains. To this end, we define new measures, extend
notions of common graph properties to hypergraphs, and assess the significance
of observed patterns by comparison with a null model and statistical tests.
  We also propose \textsc{HyperFF}, a stochastic model for generating realistic
hypergraphs. Its merits are three-fold: (a) \underline{Realistic:} it
successfully reproduces all seven patterns, in addition to five patterns
established in previous studies, (b) \underline{Self-contained:} unlike
previously proposed models, it does not rely on oracles (i.e., unexplainable
external information) at all, and it is parameterized by just two scalars, and

individual entities, which do not trivially enforce but surprisingly lead to
macroscopic properties.

push the limits of online learning in every manner to keep flourishing the
education system. One crucial component of online learning is Knowledge Tracing
(KT). The aim of KT is to model student's knowledge level based on their
answers to a sequence of exercises referred as interactions. Students acquire
their skills while solving exercises and each such interaction has a distinct
impact on student ability to solve a future exercise. This \textit{impact} is
characterized by 1) the relation between exercises involved in the interactions
and 2) student forget behavior. Traditional studies on knowledge tracing do not
explicitly model both the components jointly to estimate the impact of these
interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel Relation-aware self-attention
model for Knowledge Tracing (RKT). We introduce a relation-aware self-attention
layer that incorporates the contextual information. This contextual information
integrates both the exercise relation information through their textual content
as well as student performance data and the forget behavior information through
modeling an exponentially decaying kernel function. Extensive experiments on
three real-world datasets, among which two new collections are released to the

first-principles study to clarify the origin of the enhancement of the
transverse thermoelectric conductivity ($\alpha_{ij}$) in these ferromagnets.
The intrinsic contribution to $\alpha_{ij}$ can be understood in terms of the
Berry curvature ($\Omega$) around the Fermi level, and $\Omega$ is singularly
large along nodal lines (which are gapless in the absence of the spin-orbit
coupling) in the Brillouin zone. We find that not only the Weyl points but also
stationary points in the energy dispersion of the nodal lines play a crucial
role. The stationary points make sharp peaks in the density of states projected
onto the nodal line, clearly identifying the characteristic Fermi energies at
which $\alpha_{ij}$ is most dramatically enhanced. We also find that
$\alpha_{ij}/T$ breaks the Mott relation and show a peculiar temperature
dependence at these energies. The present results suggest that the stationary

the vertical position of the bunch measured at two beam position monitors
(BPMs) to calculate a pair of kicks which are applied to the next bunch using
two upstream kickers, thereby correcting both the vertical position and
trajectory angle. Using trains of two electron bunches separated in time by
187.6~ns, the system was optimised so as to stabilize the beam offset at the
feedback BPMs to better than 350~nm, yielding a local trajectory angle
correction to within 250~nrad. The quality of the correction was verified using
three downstream witness BPMs and the results were found to be in agreement
with the predictions of a linear lattice model used to propagate the beam
trajectory from the feedback region. This same model predicts a corrected beam
jitter of c.~1~nm at the focal point of the accelerator. Measurements with a
beam size monitor at this location demonstrate that reducing the trajectory
jitter of the beam by a factor of 4 also reduces the increase in the measured

first approach shows that the observable we are interested in is determined by
the inelastic tree-level amplitude describing the emission of a graviton in the

DNN accelerator design paradigm and its automation tool, called DNNExplorer, to
enable fast exploration of various accelerator designs under the proposed
paradigm and deliver optimized accelerator architectures for existing and
emerging DNN networks. Three key techniques are essential for DNNExplorer's
improved performance, better specificity, and scalability, including (1) a
unique accelerator design paradigm with both high-dimensional design space
support and fine-grained adjustability, (2) a dynamic design space to
accommodate different combinations of DNN workloads and targeted FPGAs, and (3)
a design space exploration (DSE) engine to generate optimized accelerator
architectures following the proposed paradigm by simultaneously considering
both FPGAs' computation and memory resources and DNN networks' layer-wise
characteristics and overall complexity. Experimental results show that, for the

in silico experimental platform. Constructing strategies at the inexpensive
lower levels in the hierarchy, we find that offline control transfer is not
viable, however analytically-informed feedback strategies show excellent
potential, even far beyond the anticipated range of applicability of the

chromospheric loops with 10-20 Mm length starting at 0.8-1.1 sunspot radii, an

answer the increasing demand for high-quality imaging from single unfocused

quantum theory beyond that of states, in particular, the dynamics of channels,
measurements, and higher-order transformations. Ref. [Phys. Rev. X 8(1), 011047
(2018)] pursues this using the process matrix formalism, together with a
definition of the possible dynamics of such process matrices, and focusing
especially on the question of evolution of causal structures. One of its major
conclusions is a strong theorem saying that, within the formalism, under
continuous and reversible transformations, the causal order between operations
must be preserved. Here we find a surprising result: if one is to take into
account a full picture of the physical evolution of operations within the
standard quantum-mechanical formalism, then one can actually draw the opposite
conclusion. That is, we show that under certain continuous and reversible
dynamics the causal order between operations is not necessarily preserved. We
moreover identify and analyse the root of this apparent contradiction,
specifically, that the commonly accepted and widely applied framework of
higher-order processes, whilst mathematically sound, is not always appropriate
for drawing conclusions on the fundamentals of physical dynamics. Finally we
show how to reconcile the elements of the whole picture following the intuition
based on entanglement processing by local operations and classical
communication.

spontaneous spinorization which is analogous to spontaneous scalarization. We
consider the model with the modified kinetic term of the Dirac field by the
insertion of the fifth gamma matrix ${\hat \gamma}^5$ and the conformal
coupling of the Dirac spinor field to the matter sector, which would lead to
the tachyonic growth of the Dirac spinor field in the high density compact
stellar backgrounds. In order to obtain the static and spherically symmetric
solutions, we have to consider the two Dirac fields at the same time. We show
that in the constant density stellar backgrounds our model gives rise to the
nontrivial solutions of the Dirac spinor fields with any number of nodes, where
one mode has one more nodes than the other. We also show that at the leading
order all the components of the effective energy-momentum tensor of the Dirac
spinor fields, after the summation over the two fields, vanish for any
separable time-dependent ansatz of the Dirac spinor fields in any static and
spherically symmetric spacetime backgrounds, indicating that spontaneous
spinorization takes place as a stealth process in the static and spherically
symmetric spacetime with any number of nodes, which would be quenched by
nonlinear effects and leave no observable effects.

of oxides containing metals with high electronegativity (metals that are hard
to oxidize). The use of reactive organometallic precursors can potentially
address this issue. To investigate the formation of radicals in MBE, we
explored three carefully chosen metal-organic precursors of tin for SnO2 and
BaSnO3 growth: tetramethyltin (TMT), tetraethyltin (TET), and hexamethylditin
(HMDT). All three precursors produced single-crystalline, atomically smooth,
and epitaxial SnO2 (101) films on r-Al2O3 in the presence of an oxygen plasma.
The study of growth kinetics revealed reaction-limited and flux-limited regimes
except for TET, which also exhibited a decrease in deposition rate with
increasing temperature above 800 C. Contrary to these similarities, the
performance of these precursors was dramatically different for BaSnO3 growth.
TMT and TET were ineffective in supplying adequate tin whereas HMDT yielded
phase-pure, stoichiometric BaSnO3 films. Significantly, HMDT resulted in
phase-pure and stoichiometric BaSnO3 films even without the use of an oxygen
plasma (i.e., with molecular oxygen alone). These results are discussed using
the ability of HMDT to form tin radicals and therefore, assisting with Sn to
Sn4+ oxidation reaction. Structural and electronic transport properties of
films grown using HMDT with and without oxygen plasma are compared. This study
provides guideline for the choice of precursors that will enable synthesis of
metal oxides containing hard-to-oxidize metals using reactive radicals in MBE.

unified GAN-based framework and define a space of design solutions for each

strategies. We conduct extensive experiments to explore the design space and

of chemical processes, we develop a comprehensive model that accounts both for
infection and for transport. In this analogy, the three different populations
of infection models correspond to three chemical species. Areal densities
emerge as the key variables, thus capturing the effect of spatial density. We
derive expressions for the kinetics of the infection rates and for the
important parameter R0, that include areal density and its spatial
distribution. Coupled with mobility the model allows the study of various
effects. We first present results for a batch reactor, the chemical process
equivalent of the SIR model. Because density makes R0 a decreasing function of
the process extent, the infection curves are different and smaller than for the
standard SIR model. We show that the effect of the initial conditions is
limited to the onset of the epidemic. We derive effective infection curves for
a number of cases, including a back-and-forth commute between regions of low
and high R0 environments. We then consider spatially distributed systems. We
show that diffusion leads to traveling waves, which in 1-D geometries propagate
at a constant speed and with a constant shape, both of which are sole functions
of R0. The infection curves are slightly different than for the batch problem,
as diffusion mitigates the infection intensity, thus leading to an effective
lower R0. The dimensional wave speed is found to be proportional to the product
of the square root of the diffusivity and of an increasing function of R0,
confirming the importance of restricting mobility in arresting the propagation
of infection. We examine the interaction of infection waves under various
conditions and scenarios, and extend the wave propagation analysis to 2-D
heterogeneous systems.

neural networks to forecast traffic in research WANs. We evaluate the efficacy
of our approach on real traffic from ESnet, the U.S. Department of Energy's

forecasting methods, our approach explicitly learns the dynamic nature of
spatiotemporal traffic patterns, showing significant improvements in
forecasting accuracy. Our technique can surpass existing statistical and deep

as it enables opportunities not only to perform precision neutrino measurements
that may uncover deviations from the present three-flavor mixing paradigm, but
also to discover new particles and unveil new interactions and symmetries
beyond those predicted in the Standard Model (SM). Of the many potential beyond
the Standard Model (BSM) topics DUNE will probe, this paper presents a
selection of studies quantifying DUNE's sensitivities to sterile neutrino
mixing, heavy neutral leptons, non-standard interactions, CPT symmetry

matter from both beam induced and cosmogenic sources, baryon number violation,
and other new physics topics that complement those at high-energy colliders and
significantly extend the present reach.

large tunnel magnetoresistance at room temperature. However, the wide bandgap

in magnetic tunnel junctions in comparison to magnesium oxide. These
simulations demonstrate a high tunnel magnetoresistance in Fe/ScN/Fe MTJs via
{\Delta}_1 and {\Delta}_2' symmetry filtering with low wavefunction decay

entangling gates that can be performed within the coherence time of the system.
In the absence of parallel quantum gate operations, this would make the quantum
simulators limited to shallow circuits. Here, we propose a protocol to
parallelize the implementation of two-qubit entangling gates between multiple
users which are spatially separated, and use a commonly shared spin chain
data-bus. Our protocol works through inducing effective interaction between
each pair of qubits without disturbing the others, therefore, it increases the
rate of gate operations without creating crosstalk. This is achieved by tuning
the Hamiltonian parameters appropriately, described in the form of two
different strategies. The tuning of the parameters makes different bilocalized
eigenstates responsible for the realization of the entangling gates between
different pairs of distant qubits. Remarkably, the performance of our protocol
is robust against increasing the length of the data-bus and the number of
users. Moreover, we show that this protocol can tolerate various types of
disorders and is applicable in the context of superconductor-based systems. The
proposed protocol can serve for realizing two-way quantum communication.

the Universe since these systems are natural laboratories for testing theories
of stellar dynamics and evolution. Particularly, globular clusters (GCs) are
one of the most important objects for studying the formation and the physical
nature of exotic systems which in turn provide basic information and tools that
can help us to understand the formation and evolution processes of star
clusters themselves, galaxies and, in general, the young Universe. Among the
most interesting objects in GCs are the cataclysmic variables (CVs), which are
interacting binaries harboring a white dwarf accreting from a low-mass
companion. Since GC densities are sufficiently high that dynamical encounters
involving binaries should be common, CV progenitors are expected to be affected
by dynamics in some way in the early stages. In this article we review the
formation channels and the influence of dynamics on the CV population in GCs.
In particular, we review recent progress in numerical simulations. Furthermore,
we discuss observational properties of CVs in GCs and the techniques used to
identify and study them. We focus the discussion on the multi-wavelength
observations carried out with HST and Chandra on the best-studied GCs NGC 6397,
NGC 6752, 47 Tucanae and Omega Centauri; on the recent spectroscopic findings
with MUSE, and on updates regarding the correlation between the number of faint
X-ray sources and the cluster stellar encounter rate. Finally, we discuss some

to leverage control-based domain knowledge to improve the sample-efficiency of

appealing, their policies tend to lag behind those of model-free agents in
terms of final reward, especially in non-trivial environments. In response,
researchers have proposed model-based agents with increasingly complex
components, from ensembles of probabilistic dynamics models, to heuristics for
mitigating model error. In a reversal of this trend, we show that simple
model-based agents can be derived from existing ideas that not only match, but
outperform state-of-the-art model-free agents in terms of both
sample-efficiency and final reward. We find that a model-free soft value
estimate for policy evaluation and a model-based stochastic value gradient for
policy improvement is an effective combination, achieving state-of-the-art
results on a high-dimensional humanoid control task, which most model-based
agents are unable to solve. Our findings suggest that model-based policy

quasars to constrain the frequency of extreme amplitude X-ray variability that
is intrinsic to the quasar corona and innermost accretion flow. The quasars in
this investigation are all spectroscopically confirmed, optically bright ($m_i
\leq$ 20.2), and contain no identifiable broad absorption lines in their
optical/ultraviolet spectra. This sample includes quasars spanning $z \approx$
0.1 - 4 and probes X-ray variability on timescales of up to $\approx$ 12
rest-frame years. Variability amplitudes are computed between every epoch of
observation for each quasar and are analyzed as a function of timescale and
luminosity. The tail-heavy distributions of variability amplitudes at all
timescales indicate that extreme X-ray variations are driven by an additional
physical mechanism and not just typical random fluctuations of the coronal
emission. Similarly, extreme X-ray variations of low-luminosity quasars seem to
be driven by an additional physical mechanism, whereas high-luminosity quasars
seem more consistent with random fluctuations. The amplitude at which an X-ray
variability event can be considered extreme is quantified for different
timescales and luminosities. Extreme X-ray variations occur more frequently at
long timescales ( $\Delta t \gtrsim$ 300 days) than at shorter timescales, and
in low-luminosity quasars compared to high-luminosity quasars over a similar
timescale. A binomial analysis indicates that extreme intrinsic X-ray
variations are rare, with a maximum occurrence rate of <2.4% of observations.
Finally, we present X-ray variability and basic optical emission-line
properties of three archival quasars that have been newly discovered to exhibit
extreme X-ray variability.

and atmosphere of the Sun are excited. Traditionally, turbulent convection in
the interior is considered to be the source of wave excitation in the quiet
Sun. Over the last few decades, acoustic events observed in the intergranular
lanes in the photosphere have emerged as a strong candidate for a wave
excitation source. Here we report our observations of wave excitation by a new
type of event: rapidly changing granules. Our observations were carried out
with the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph in the H$\alpha$ and Ca II 8542
$\unicode{xC5}$ lines and the TiO 7057 $\unicode{xC5}$ broadband filter imager
of the 1.6 m Goode Solar Telescope at the Big Bear Solar Observatory. We
identify granules in the internetwork region that undergo rapid dynamic changes
such as collapse (event 1), fragmentation (event 2), or submergence (event 3).
In the photospheric images, these granules become significantly darker than
neighboring granules. Following the granules' rapid changes, transient
oscillations are detected in the photospheric and chromospheric layers. In the
case of event 1, the dominant period of the oscillations is close to 4.2 min in
the photosphere and 3.8 min in the chromosphere. Moreover, in the Ca II$-$0.5
$\unicode{xC5}$ raster image, we observe repetitive brightenings in the
location of the rapidly changing granules that are considered the manifestation
of shock waves. Based on our results, we suggest that dynamic changes of
granules can generate upward-propagating acoustic waves in the quiet Sun that

not expected from conventional stellar evolution, but can be produced naturally
via neutron star (NS) implosions induced by capture of small primordial black
holes (PBHs) or from accumulation of some varieties of particle dark matter. We
argue that a unique signature of such ""transmuted"" solar-mass BHs is that their
mass distribution would follow that of the NSs. This would be distinct from the
mass function of black holes in the solar-mass range predicted either by
conventional stellar evolution or early Universe PBH production. We propose
that analysis of the solar-mass BH population mass distribution in a narrow
mass window of $\sim 1-2.5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ can provide a simple yet powerful
test of the origin of these BHs. Recent LIGO/VIRGO gravitational wave (GW)
observations of the binary merger events GW190425 and GW190814 are consistent
with a BH mass in the range $\sim 1.5-2.6~M_{\odot}$. Though these results have
fueled speculation on dark matter-transmuted solar-mass BHs, we demonstrate
that it is unlikely that the origin of these particular events stems from NS
implosions. Data from upcoming GW observations will be able to distinguish
between solar-mass BHs and NSs with high confidence. This capability will
facilitate and enhance the efficacy of our proposed test.

simulations within a live, cosmologically evolved cluster with the moving mesh
code AREPO. We find that mock X-ray and radio lobe properties are in good
agreement with observations with different power jets transitioning from FR-I
to FR-II-like morphologies. During the lobe inflation phase, heating by both
internal and bow shocks contributes to lobe energetics, and $\sim 40$ per cent
of the feedback energy goes into the $PdV$ work done by the expanding lobes.
Low power jets are more likely to simply displace gas during lobe inflation,
but higher power jets become more effective at driving shocks and heating the
intracluster medium (ICM), although shocks rarely exceed $\mathcal{M}\sim 2-3$.
Once the lobe inflation phase ceases, cluster weather significantly impacts the
lobe evolution. Lower power jet lobes are more readily disrupted and mixed with
the ICM, depositing up to $\sim 70$ per cent of the injected energy, however,
ultimately the equivalent of $\gtrsim 50$ per cent of the feedback energy ends
up as potential energy of the system. Even though the mean ICM entropy is
increased up to $80$~Myr after the jets switch off, AGN heating is gentle,
inducing no large variations in cluster radial profiles in accord with
observations.

$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in the presence of in-plane magnetic fields has been taken as
a strong evidence for Kitaev spin liquid. Apart from the quantization, the
observed sign structure of the thermal Hall conductivity is also consistent
with predictions from the exact solution of the Kitaev model. Namely, the
thermal Hall conductivity changes sign when the field direction is reversed
with respect to the heat current, which is perpendicular to one of the three
nearest neighbor bonds on the honeycomb lattice. On the other hand, it is
almost zero when the field is applied along the bond direction. Here, we show
that such a peculiar sign structure of the thermal Hall conductivity is a
generic property of the polarized state in the presence of in-plane
magnetic-fields. In this case, thermal Hall effect arises from topological
magnons with finite Chern numbers and the sign structure follows from the
symmetries of the momentum space Berry curvature. Using a realistic spin model
with bond-dependent interactions, we show that the thermal Hall conductivity
can have a magnitude comparable to that observed in the experiments. Hence the
sign structure alone cannot make a strong case for Kitaev spin liquid. The
quantization at very low temperatures, however, will be a decisive test as the
magnon contribution vanishes in the zero temperature limit.

hydrodynamics simulation of a single galaxy, chosen to be typical of the Lyman
alpha-emitting galaxies detected by MUSE in deep fields. We use this simulation
to study the origin and dynamics of the high-redshift circum-galactic medium

material infalling for the first time towards the halo center, but with the
inner CGM also containing a comparable amount of mass that has moved past
first-pericentric passage, and is in the process of settling into a
rotationally supported configuration. Making the connection to Lyman alpha
emission, we find that the observed extended surface brightness profile is due
to a combination of three components: scattering of galactic Lyman alpha
emission in the CGM, in-situ emission of CGM gas (mostly infalling), and Lyman
alpha emission from small satellite galaxies. The weight of these contributions
vary with distance from the galaxy such that (1) scattering dominates the inner

an exponentially truncated power law better describes the observed mass

to $L=13$ and $18$ respectively. We argue for a critical energy of the
localization phase transition which scales as $E_c \propto L^{1/2}$, consistent
with finite size numerics. We also show evidence for a reentrant MBL phase at
even lower energies despite the presence of strong effects of the central mode
in this regime. Similar results should occur in the central spin-$S$ problem at
large $S$ and in certain models of cavity QED.

into a WN11h star. Our spectroscopic monitoring with the Southern African Large

15-906 during the last 8 yr, while the V-band light curve of this star over
years 1999--2019 shows quasi-periodic variability with a period of \approx1700
d and an amplitude of \approx0.1 mag. We estimated the mass of the shell to be
2.9\pm0.5 Msun assuming the gas-to-dust mass ratio of 200. The presence of such
a shell indicates that Wray 15-906 has suffered substantial mass loss in the

obscured in high mass galaxies, while in low mass galaxies the radiation
escapes unobstructed. During the reionization epoch, the presence of evolved,
dust obscured galaxies are a challenge to galaxy formation and evolution
models. By means of a chemodynamical evolution model, we investigate the star
formation and dust production required to build up the bulk of dust in galaxies
with initial baryonic mass ranging from $7.5 \times 10^{7}$~M$_\odot$ to $2.0
\times 10^{12}$~M$_\odot$. The star formation efficiency was also chosen to
represent the star formation rate from irregular dwarf to giant elliptical
galaxies. We adopted a dust coagulation efficiency from \citep[][Case
A]{dwek1998evolution} as well as a lower efficiency one (Case B), about five
times smaller than Case A. All possible combination of these parameters was
computed, summing forty different scenarios. We find that in high stellar
formation systems the dust accretion in ISM rules over stellar production
before the star formation peak, making these systems almost insensible to dust
coagulation efficiency. In low star formation systems, the difference between
Case A and B lasts longer, mainly in small galaxies. Thus, small irregular
galaxies should be the best place to discriminate different dust sources. In
our observational sample, taken from the literature, dust-to-gas ratio tends to
be more spread only than dust mass, for both stellar mass and star formation
rate. Dust-to-gas vs. dust-to-star diagram is a good tracer for both galaxy and
dust evolution, due to the link between gas, star, dust and star formation
rate. However, the model do not constrain simultaneously all this quantities.
The new generation facilities (such as JWST, ELT, VLT and SPICA) will be
indispensable to constrain dust formation across the cosmic time.

Hasan et al. (2018) that leverages the structure of commuting patterns and
urban communities to optimize trip sharing. It aims at quantifying the benefits
of autonomous vehicles for community-based trip sharing, compared to a
car-pooling platform where vehicles are driven by their owners. In the
considered problem, each rider specifies a desired arrival time for her inbound
trip (commuting to work) and a departure time for her outbound trip (commuting
back home). In addition, her commute time cannot deviate too much from the
duration of a direct trip. Prior work motivated by reducing parking pressure
and congestion in the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan, showed that a car-pooling
platform for community-based trip sharing could reduce the number of vehicles
by close to 60%.
  This paper studies the potential benefits of autonomous vehicles in further
reducing the number of vehicles needed to serve all these commuting trips. It
proposes a column-generation procedure that generates and assembles mini routes
to serve inbound and outbound trips, using a lexicographic objective that first
minimizes the required vehicle count and then the total travel distance. The
optimization algorithm is evaluated on a large-scale, real-world dataset of
commute trips from the city of Ann Arbor, Michigan. The results of the
optimization show that it can leverage autonomous vehicles to reduce the daily
vehicle usage by 92%, improving upon the results of the original Commute Trip
Sharing Problem by 34%, while also reducing daily vehicle miles traveled by
approximately 30%. These results demonstrate the significant potential of
autonomous vehicles for the shared commuting of a community to a common work

architectural style to build web APIs that can integrate software systems over

the dependent applications that rely on their services when they introduce
breaking changes, e.g., an older version of the API is no longer supported. To
warn developers promptly and thus prevent critical impact on downstream
applications, a deprecated-removed model should be followed, and
deprecation-related information such as alternative approaches should also be
listed. While API deprecation analysis as a theme is not new, most existing
work focuses on non-web APIs, such as the ones provided by Java and Android. To
investigate RESTful API deprecation, we propose a framework called RADA
(RESTful API Deprecation Analyzer). RADA is capable of automatically
identifying deprecated API elements and analyzing impacted operations from an
OpenAPI specification, a machine-readable profile for describing RESTful web
service. We apply RADA on 2,224 OpenAPI specifications of 1,368 RESTful APIs
collected from APIs.guru, the largest directory of OpenAPI specifications.
Based on the data mined by RADA, we perform an empirical study to investigate
how the deprecated-removed protocol is followed in RESTful APIs and
characterize practices in RESTful API deprecation. The results of our study
reveal several severe deprecation-related problems in existing RESTful APIs.
Our implementation of RADA and detailed empirical results are publicly
available for future intelligent tools that could automatically identify and
migrate usage of deprecated RESTful API operations in client code.

calculating the pressure-induced change in strain energy. Molecular dynamics
simulations showed that defects nucleated from a region of high stress region

in the former and $|m| \ne l$ in the latter. Precession or eccentricity will
also break this degeneracy. This implies that lensed GWs will not necessarily
be consistent with (unlensed) predictions from general relativity (GR).
Therefore, unlike EM lensing, GW SL can lead to images with an observable
modified phase evolution. However, for a wide parameter space, the lensed
waveform is similar enough to an unlensed waveform that detection pipelines
will still find it. For present detectors, templates with a shifted
detector-dependent orientation angle have SNR differences of less than $1\%$
for mass ratios up to 0.1, and less than $5\%$ for precession parameters up to
0.5 and eccentricities up to 0.4 at 20Hz. The mismatch is lower than $10\%$
with the alternative detector-independent coalescence phase shift. Nonetheless,
for a loud enough source, even with one image it may be possible to directly
identify it as a SL image from its non-GR waveform. In more extreme cases,
lensing may lead to considerable distortions, and the lensed GWs may be
undetected with current searches. Nevertheless, an exact template with a phase
shift in Fourier space can always be constructed to fit any lensed GW. We
conclude that an optimal search strategy would incorporate phase information in
all stages, with an exact treatment in the final assessment of the probability
of multiple lensed events.

functions for microservices-based applications. A vast majority of these
microservices typically span less than a second, have strict SLO requirements,

aforementioned characteristics introduce a new set of challenges, especially in
terms of container provisioning and management, as the state-of-the-art
resource management frameworks, employed in serverless platforms, tend to look
at microservice-based applications similar to conventional monolithic

scheduling and colossal container over-provisioning, especially during workload
fluctuations, thereby resulting in poor resource utilization.
  In this work, we quantify the above shortcomings using a variety of workloads

To address them, we propose \emph{Fifer} -- an adaptive resource management

key idea is to make \emph{Fifer} (i) utilization conscious by efficiently bin
packing jobs to fewer containers using function-aware container scaling and
intelligent request batching, and (ii) at the same time, SLO-compliant by
proactively spawning containers to avoid cold-starts, thus minimizing the
overall response latency. Combining these benefits, \emph{Fifer} improves
container utilization and cluster-wide energy consumption by 4x and 31%,
respectively, without compromising on SLO's, when compared to the

puts all the other accounts at much higher risk. Generally, an adversary may
use any side-information he/she possesses about the user, be it demographic
information, password reuse on a previously compromised account, or any other
relevant information to devise a better brute-force strategy (so called
targeted attack). In this work, we consider a distributed brute-force attack
scenario in which $m$ adversaries, each observing some side information,
attempt breaching a password secured system. We compare two strategies: an
uncoordinated attack in which the adversaries query the system based on their
own side-information until they find the correct password, and a fully
coordinated attack in which the adversaries pool their side-information and
query the system together. For passwords $\mathbf{X}$ of length $n$, generated
independently and identically from a distribution $P_X$, we establish an
asymptotic closed-form expression for the uncoordinated and coordinated
strategies when the side-information $\mathbf{Y}_{(m)}$ are generated
independently from passing $\mathbf{X}$ through a memoryless channel $P_{Y|X}$,
as the length of the password $n$ goes to infinity. We illustrate our results
for binary symmetric channels and binary erasure channels, two families of
side-information channels which model password reuse. We demonstrate that two
coordinated agents perform asymptotically better than any finite number of
uncoordinated agents for these channels, meaning that sharing side-information
is very valuable in distributed attacks.

an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph G(n, 1/2), and one is interested in either detecting
or recovering this planted clique. This problem is interesting because it is
widely believed to show a statistical-computational gap at clique size
k=sqrt{n}, and has emerged as the prototypical problem with such a gap from
which average-case hardness of other statistical problems can be deduced. It
also displays a tight computational connection between the detection and
recovery variants, unlike other problems of a similar nature. This wide
investigation into the computational complexity of the planted clique problem
has, however, mostly focused on its time complexity. In this work, we ask-
  Do the statistical-computational phenomena that make the planted clique an
interesting problem also hold when we use `space efficiency' as our notion of
computational efficiency?
  It is relatively easy to show that a positive answer to this question depends
on the existence of a O(log n) space algorithm that can recover planted cliques
of size k = Omega(sqrt{n}). Our main result comes very close to designing such
an algorithm. We show that for k=Omega(sqrt{n}), the recovery problem can be
solved in O((log*{n}-log*{k/sqrt{n}}) log n) bits of space.
  1. If k = omega(sqrt{n}log^{(l)}n) for any constant integer l > 0, the space
usage is O(log n) bits.
  2.If k = Theta(sqrt{n}), the space usage is O(log*{n} log n) bits.
  Our result suggests that there does exist an O(log n) space algorithm to
recover cliques of size k = Omega(sqrt{n}), since we come very close to
achieving such parameters. This provides evidence that the
statistical-computational phenomena that (conjecturally) hold for planted
clique time complexity also (conjecturally) hold for space complexity.

built, its type or purpose, the dynasty which established it, etc.
Particularly, Indian subcontinent exhibits a huge deal of variation in terms of
architectural styles owing to its rich cultural heritage. In this paper, we
propose a framework that utilizes hierarchy to preserve semantic information
while performing image classification or image retrieval. We encode the learnt
deep embeddings to construct a dictionary of images and then utilize a
re-ranking framework on the the retrieved results using DeLF features. The
semantic information preserved in these embeddings helps to classify unknown
monuments at higher level of granularity in hierarchy. We have curated a large,
novel Indian heritage monuments dataset comprising of images of historical,
cultural and religious importance with subtypes of eras, dynasties and
architectural styles. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework
in image classification and retrieval tasks and compare it with other competing
methods on this dataset.

(i.e., observations from itself) but also on outer variables and inter-temporal
relationships (i.e., observations from other-selves). An extensive set of
experiments was conducted comparing ReGENN with dozens of ensemble methods and
classical statistical ones, showing sound improvement of up to 64.87% over the
competing algorithms. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the intermediate

improved if paying attention to how multiple multivariate data synchronously

Dirichlet space in which every metric ball has compact closure (MMD space), the
finiteness of the conformal walk dimension characterizes the conjunction of the
metric doubling property and the elliptic Harnack inequality. Roughly speaking,
the conformal walk dimension of an MMD space is defined as the infimum over all
possible values of the walk dimension with which the parabolic Harnack
inequality can be made to hold by a time change of the associated diffusion and
by a quasisymmetric change of the metric. We show that the conformal walk
dimension of any MMD space satisfying the metric doubling property and the
elliptic Harnack inequality is two, and provide a necessary condition for a
pair of such changes to attain the infimum defining the conformal walk
dimension when it is attained by the original pair. We also prove a necessary
condition for the existence of such a pair attaining the infimum in the setting
of a self-similar Dirichlet form on a self-similar set, and apply it to show

with increasing coupling strength from integrable to chaotic motion, following
the KAM scenario. Raising $N$ to values of the order of 10 and higher, the
dynamics crosses over to a quasi-relaxation, approaching either one of the
stable equilibria at the two minima of the potential. We corroborate the
irreversibility of this relaxation on other characteristic timescales of the

single model that will best generalize to an unseen target domain. As such,
many prior approaches focus on learning representations which persist across
all source domains with the assumption that these domain agnostic
representations will generalize well. However, often individual domains contain
characteristics which are unique and when leveraged can significantly aid
in-domain recognition performance. To produce a model which best generalizes to
both seen and unseen domains, we propose learning domain specific masks. The
masks are encouraged to learn a balance of domain-invariant and domain-specific
features, thus enabling a model which can benefit from the predictive power of
specialized features while retaining the universal applicability of
domain-invariant features. We demonstrate competitive performance compared to
naive baselines and state-of-the-art methods on both PACS and DomainNet.

transmission to numerous sensors from the BS using a single radio,
simultaneously, which we achieve by proposing a distributed implementation of

SNOW-tree through a seamless integration of multiple SNOWs where they form a
tree structure and are under the same management/control. We address the intra-
and inter-SNOW interferences by formulating a constrained optimization problem

maximize scalability by managing the spectrum sharing across the SNOWs. By
proving the NP-hardness of SOP, we then propose two polynomial-time methods to

scatter fluence and improve image quality in cone beam computed tomography
(CBCT). In this work, two different aspects of 2D ASGs, their scatter rejection
and correction capability, were investigated in CBCT experiments. To correct
residual scatter transmitted through the 2D ASG, it was used as a scatter
measurement device with a novel method: grid-based scatter sampling. Methods:
Three focused 2D ASG prototypes with grid ratios of 8, 12, and 16 were
developed for linac-mounted CBCT geometry. In the first phase, 2D ASGs were
used as a scatter rejection device, and the effect of grid ratio on CT number
accuracy and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) evaluated in CBCT images. In the
second phase, the grid-based scatter sampling method was implemented. The
percent change in CT numbers was measured by changing the phantom size from
head to pelvis configuration.Results: When 2D ASG was used as a scatter
rejection device, CT number variation due to change in phantom dimensions was
reduced from 23% to 2 - 6%. A grid ratio of 16 yielded the lowest CT number
variation. All three 2D ASGs yielded improvement in CNR, up to a factor of two
in pelvis-sized phantoms. When 2D ASG prototypes were used for both scatter
rejection and correction, CT number variations were reduced further, to 1.3 -
2.6%. Conclusions: When 2D ASG was used solely as a scatter rejection device,
substantial improvement in CT number accuracy could be achieved by increasing
the grid ratio. 2D ASGs could also provide significant CNR improvement even at
lower grid ratios. When 2D ASG was used in conjunction with the grid-based
scatter sampling method, it provided further improvement in CT number accuracy,
irrespective of the grid ratio, while preserving 2D ASG's capacity to improve
CNR.

particle suspensions over a wide range of particle-to-fluid density ratios. The
dynamics of particle suspensions are characterized by the average momentum
equation, where the dominant contribution to the average momentum transfer
between particles and fluid is the average drag force. In this study, the
average drag force is quantified using particle-resolved direct numerical
simulation in a canonical problem: a statistically homogeneous suspension where
an imposed mean pressure gradient establishes a steady mean slip velocity
between the phases. The effects of particle velocity fluctuations, particle
clustering, and mobility of particles are studied separately. It is shown that
the competing effects of these factors could decrease, increase, or keep
constant the drag of freely evolving suspensions in comparison to fixed beds at
different flow conditions. It is also shown that the effects of particle
clustering and particle velocity fluctuations are not independent. Finally, a
correlation for interphase drag force in terms of volume fraction, Reynolds
number, and density ratio is proposed. Two different approaches (symbolic
regression and predefined functional forms) are used to develop the drag
correlation. Since this drag correlation has been inferred from simulations of
particle suspensions, it includes the effect of the motion of the particles.
This drag correlation can be used in computational fluid dynamics simulations
of particle-laden flows that solve the average two-fluid equations where the
accuracy of the drag law affects the prediction of overall flow behavior.

structure was formed by joining four similar structures through softer material
at the vertices. A monolithic structure of this kind is accomplished through a
custom-built multi-material 3D printer. The model works in a way that, when
torque is applied along the face of the rotational squares, they tend to bend
at the vertex of the softer material, and due to the connected-ness of the
design, a proper opening and closing motion is achieved. To demonstrate the
potential of this part as an important component for robots, two applications
are presented: a soft gripper and a crawling robot. Vacuum-driven actuators
move both the applications. The proposed gripper combines the benefits of two
types of grippers whose fingers are placed parallel and equally spaced to each
other, in a single design. This gripper is adaptable to the size of the object
and can grasp objects with large and small cross-sections alike. A novel
bending actuator, which is made of soft material and bends in curvature when
vacuumed, provides the grasping nature of the gripper. Crawling robots, in
addition to their versatile nature, provide a better interaction with humans.
The designed crawling robot employs negative pressure-driven actuators to
highlight linear and turning locomotion.

eigenvalues. Degeneracy is the main signature of this topology, since it is
totally absent in fully unbalanced trees. We also establish some analytical and
numerical results about the largest eigenvalue of Laplacian matrices for these

important structural property of phylogenetic trees is the balance, which
measures how taxa are distributed among clades. Tree balance can be measured
using indices such as the Sackin ($S$) and the Total Cophenetic ($\Phi$), which
are based on the distance between nodes of the tree and its root. Here, we
propose a new metric for tree balance, $\bar{d}$, the Area per Pair (APP) of
the tree, which is a re-scaled version of the so called tree area. We compute
$\bar{d}$ for the rooted caterpillar and maximally balanced trees and we also
obtain exact formulas for its expected value and variance under the Yule model.
The variance of APP for Yule trees has the remarkable property of converging to
an asymptotic constant value for large trees. We compare the Sackin, Total
Cophenetic and APP indices for hundreds of empirical phylogenies and show that
APP represents the observed distribution of tree balances better than the two
other metrics.

semi-angle of the illumination. What is often overlooked however is that small
deviations from this optimum can degrade both the resolution and
interpretability of image contrast. A 30% error in aperture radius can lead to
a factor of 2 contrast reduction in typical lattice spacings, and a 5 {\AA}
error in the thickness measurement of thin layers (such as gate oxides).
Theoretical calculations of the optimum convergence angles, from a wave-optical
consideration of the probe forming conditions, are explained and their
consequences discussed. An experimental approach to the measurement and tuning
of the convergence angle is then introduced.

dataset is background). We demonstrate that both standard fine-tuning
approaches and state-of-the-art approaches for training on imbalanced datasets
do not produce accurate deep models in the presence of this extreme imbalance.
Our key observation is that the extreme imbalance due to the background
category can be drastically reduced by leveraging visual knowledge from an
existing pre-trained model. Specifically, the background category is ""split""
into smaller and more coherent pseudo-categories during training using a
pre-trained model. We incorporate background splitting into an image
classification model by adding an auxiliary loss that learns to mimic the
predictions of the existing, pre-trained image classification model. Note that
this process is automatic and requires no additional manual labels. The
auxiliary loss regularizes the feature representation of the shared network
trunk by requiring it to discriminate between previously homogeneous background
instances and reduces overfitting to the small number of rare category
positives. We also show that BG splitting can be combined with other background
imbalance methods to further improve performance. We evaluate our method on a
modified version of the iNaturalist dataset where only a small subset of rare
category labels are available during training (all other images are labeled as
background). By jointly learning to recognize ImageNet categories and selected
iNaturalist categories, our approach yields performance that is 42.3 mAP points

observable functions is fundamental for the application of EDMD to nonlinear
problems arising in systems and control. Existing methods either start from a
set of dictionary functions and look for the subset that best fits the
underlying nonlinear dynamics or they rely on machine learning algorithms to
""learn"" observable functions. Conversely, in this paper, we start from the
dynamical system model and lift it through the Lie derivatives, rendering it
into a polynomial form. This proposed transformation into a polynomial form is
exact, and it provides an adequate set of observable functions. The strength of
the proposed approach is its applicability to a broader class of nonlinear
dynamical systems, particularly those with nonpolynomial functions and
compositions thereof. Moreover, it retains the physical interpretability of the
underlying dynamical system and can be readily integrated into existing
numerical libraries. The proposed approach is illustrated with an application
to electric power systems. The modeled system consists of a single generator
connected to an infinite bus, where nonlinear terms include sine and cosine
functions. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure
in off-attractor nonlinear dynamics for estimation and prediction; the
observable functions obtained from the proposed construction outperform methods
that use dictionary functions comprising monomials or radial basis functions.

a tensor from incomplete observations. LRTC plays an important role in many
applications such as signal processing, computer vision, machine learning, and
neuroscience. A widely used approach is to combine the tensor completion data
fitting term with a regularizer based on a convex relaxation of the multilinear
ranks of the tensor. For the data fitting function, we model the tensor
variable by using the Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition and for the
low-rank promoting regularization function, we consider a graph Laplacian-based
function which exploits correlations between the rows of the matrix unfoldings.
For solving our LRTC model, we propose an efficient alternating minimization
algorithm. Furthermore, based on the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property, we show
that the sequence generated by the proposed algorithm globally converges to a
critical point of the objective function. Besides, an alternating direction
method of multipliers algorithm is also developed for the LRTC model. Extensive
numerical experiments on synthetic and real data indicate that the proposed
algorithms are effective and efficient.

processing applications. But much of the success of deep learning relies on
annotated examples. Annotation is time-consuming and expensive to produce at
scale. Here we are interested in methods for reducing the required quantity of
annotated data -- by making the learning methods more knowledge efficient so as
to make them more applicable in low annotation (low resource) settings. There
are various classical approaches to making the models more knowledge efficient
such as multi-task learning, transfer learning, weakly supervised and
unsupervised learning etc. This thesis focuses on adapting such classical
methods to modern deep learning models and algorithms.
  This thesis describes four works aimed at making machine learning models more
knowledge efficient. First, we propose a knowledge rich deep learning model
(KRDL) as a unifying learning framework for incorporating prior knowledge into
deep models. In particular, we apply KRDL built on Markov logic networks to
denoise weak supervision. Second, we apply a KRDL model to assist the machine
reading models to find the correct evidence sentences that can support their
decision. Third, we investigate the knowledge transfer techniques in
multilingual setting, where we proposed a method that can improve pre-trained
multilingual BERT based on the bilingual dictionary. Fourth, we present an
episodic memory network for language modelling, in which we encode the large
external knowledge for the pre-trained GPT.

critical ways, lack the intelligence of even a single-celled organism? The
answer is clearly 'yes' for narrow AI systems. Animals, plants, and even
single-celled organisms learn to reliably avoid danger and move towards food.
This is accomplished via a physical knowledge preserving metamodel that
autonomously generates useful models of the world. We posit that preserving the
structure of knowledge is critical for higher intelligences that manage
increasingly higher levels of abstraction, be they human or artificial. This is
the key lesson learned from applying AGI subsystems to complex real-world
problems that require continuous learning and adaptation. In this paper, we
introduce the Deep Fusion Reasoning Engine (DFRE), which implements a
knowledge-preserving metamodel and framework for constructing applied AGI
systems. The DFRE metamodel exhibits some important fundamental knowledge
preserving properties such as clear distinctions between symmetric and
antisymmetric relations, and the ability to create a hierarchical knowledge
representation that clearly delineates between levels of abstraction. The DFRE
metamodel, which incorporates these capabilities, demonstrates how this
approach benefits AGI in specific ways such as managing combinatorial explosion
and enabling cumulative, distributed and federated learning. Our experiments
show that the proposed framework achieves 94% accuracy on average on
unsupervised object detection and recognition. This work is inspired by the
state-of-the-art approaches to AGI, recent AGI-aspiring work, the granular
computing community, as well as Alfred Korzybski's general semantics.

modeling dependent binary data, where the sufficient statistic is a
multi-linear form of degree $p \geq 2$. This is a natural generalization of the
matrix Ising model, that provides a convenient mathematical framework for
capturing higher-order dependencies in complex relational data. In this paper,
we consider the problem of estimating the natural parameter of the $p$-tensor
Ising model given a single sample from the distribution on $N$ nodes. Our
estimate is based on the maximum pseudo-likelihood (MPL) method, which provides
a computationally efficient algorithm for estimating the parameter that avoids
computing the intractable partition function. We derive general conditions
under which the MPL estimate is $\sqrt N$-consistent, that is, it converges to
the true parameter at rate $1/\sqrt N$. In particular, we show the $\sqrt
N$-consistency of the MPL estimate in the $p$-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK)
model, spin systems on general $p$-uniform hypergraphs, and Ising models on the
hypergraph stochastic block model (HSBM). In fact, for the HSBM we pin down the
exact location of the phase transition threshold, which is determined by the
positivity of a certain mean-field variational problem, such that above this
threshold the MPL estimate is $\sqrt N$-consistent, while below the threshold
no estimator is consistent. Finally, we derive the precise fluctuations of the
MPL estimate in the special case of the $p$-tensor Curie-Weiss model. An
interesting consequence of our results is that the MPL estimate in the
Curie-Weiss model saturates the Cramer-Rao lower bound at all points above the
estimation threshold, that is, the MPL estimate incurs no loss in asymptotic
efficiency, even though it is obtained by minimizing only an approximation of
the true likelihood function for computational tractability.

The wave-breaking process
energizes turbulent fluctuations that break bubbles in quick succession to
generate a wide range of bubble sizes. Understanding this generation mechanism
paves the way towards the development of predictive models for large-scale
maritime and climate simulations. Garrett et al. (2000) suggested that
super-Hinze-scale turbulent breakup transfers entrained gas from large to small
bubble sizes in the manner of a cascade. We provide a theoretical basis for
this bubble-mass cascade by appealing to how energy is transferred from large
to small scales in the energy cascade central to single-phase turbulence
theories. A bubble break-up cascade requires that break-up events predominantly
transfer bubble mass from a certain bubble size to a slightly smaller size on
average. This property is called locality. In this paper, we analytically
quantify locality by extending the population balance equation in conservative
form to derive the bubble-mass transfer rate from large to small sizes. Using
our proposed measures of locality, we show that scalings relevant to turbulent
bubbly flows, including those postulated by Garrett et al. (2000) and observed
in breaking-wave experiments and simulations, are consistent with a strongly
local transfer rate, where the influence of non-local contributions decays in a
power-law fashion. These theoretical predictions are confirmed using numerical
simulations in Part 2, revealing key physical aspects of the bubble break-up
cascade phenomenology. Locality supports the universality of turbulent
small-bubble break-up, which simplifies the development of subgrid-scale models
to predict oceanic small-bubble statistics of practical importance.

perform image restoration by learning from training examples of noisy-clean
image pairs. It has become the go-to methodology for tackling image restoration
and has outperformed the traditional non-local class of methods. However, the
top-performing networks are generally composed of many convolutional layers and
hundreds of neurons, with trainable parameters in excess of several millions.
We claim that this is due to the inherent linear nature of convolution-based
transformation, which is inadequate for handling severe restoration problems.
Recently, a non-linear generalization of CNNs, called the operational neural
networks (ONN), has been shown to outperform CNN on AWGN denoising. However,
its formulation is burdened by a fixed collection of well-known nonlinear
operators and an exhaustive search to find the best possible configuration for
a given architecture, whose efficacy is further limited by a fixed output layer
operator assignment. In this study, we leverage the Taylor series-based
function approximation to propose a self-organizing variant of ONNs, Self-ONNs,
for image restoration, which synthesizes novel nodal transformations onthe-fly
as part of the learning process, thus eliminating the need for redundant
training runs for operator search. In addition, it enables a finer level of
operator heterogeneity by diversifying individual connections of the receptive
fields and weights. We perform a series of extensive ablation experiments
across three severe image restoration tasks. Even when a strict equivalence of
learnable parameters is imposed, Self-ONNs surpass CNNs by a considerable
margin across all problems, improving the generalization performance by up to 3

been widely studied in traditional ferromagnetic metal and insulator films and
scarcely in two-dimensional layered materials. Here we uncover a new
nonreciprocal magneto-inelastic light scattering effect in ferromagnetic
few-layer CrI3. We observed a rotation of the polarization plane of inelastic
light scattering between -20o and +60o that are tunable by an out-of-plane
magnetic field from -2.5 to 2.5 T. It is experimentally observed that the
degree of polarization can be magnetically manipulated between -20% and 85%.
This work raises a new magneto-optical phenomenon and could create
opportunities of applying 2D ferromagnetic materials in Raman lasing,
topological photonics, and magneto-optical modulator for information transport
and storage.

for their promising applications in spintronics. It has been indicated that in
the two materials within this class, CrI$_3$ and VI$_3$, the magnetic ground
state, the band gap, and the Fermi level could be manipulated by varying the
layer thickness, strain or doping. To understand how these factors impact the
properties, a detailed understanding of the electronic structure would be
required. However, the experimental studies of the electronic structure of
these materials are still very sparse. Here, we present the detailed electronic
structure of CrI$_3$ and VI$_3$ measured by angle-resolved photoemission
spectroscopy (ARPES). Our results show a band-gap of the order of 1 eV, sharply
contrasting some theoretical predictions such as Dirac half-metallicity and
metallic phases, indicating that the intra-atomic interaction parameter (U) and
spin-orbit coupling (SOC) were not properly accounted for in the calculations.
We also find significant differences in the electronic properties of these two
materials, in spite of similarities in their crystal structure. In CrI$_3$, the
valence band maximum is dominated by the I 5{\it p}, whereas in VI$_3$ it is
dominated by the V 3{\it d} derived states. Our results represent valuable
input for further improvements in the theoretical modeling of these systems.

radiological management of breast disease, facilitating a number of important
clinical applications, including quantitative assessment of breast density and
early detection of malignancies based on X-ray mammography. Common to such
applications is the need to automatically discriminate between breast tissue
and adjacent anatomy, with the latter being predominantly represented by
pectoralis major (or pectoral muscle). Especially in the case of mammograms
acquired in the mediolateral oblique (MLO) view, the muscle is easily
confusable with some elements of breast anatomy due to their morphological and
photometric similarity. As a result, the problem of automatic detection and
segmentation of pectoral muscle in MLO mammograms remains a challenging task,
innovative approaches to which are still required and constantly searched for.
To address this problem, the present paper introduces a two-step segmentation
strategy based on a combined use of data-driven prediction (deep learning) and
graph-based image processing. In particular, the proposed method employs a
convolutional neural network (CNN) which is designed to predict the location of
breast-pectoral boundary at different levels of spatial resolution.
Subsequently, the predictions are used by the second stage of the algorithm, in
which the desired boundary is recovered as a solution to the shortest path
problem on a specially designed graph. The proposed algorithm has been tested
on three different datasets (i.e., MIAS, CBIS-DDSm and InBreast) using a range
of quantitative metrics. The results of comparative analysis show considerable
improvement over state-of-the-art, while offering the possibility of model-free
and fully automatic processing.

orders be assigned to vehicles so that the delivery time is minimized? Several
decisions have to be made: (1) assignment of orders to vehicles, (2) grouping
orders into batches to cope with limited vehicle availability, and (3) adapting
to dynamic positions of delivery vehicles. We show that the minimization
problem is not only NP-hard but inapproximable in polynomial time. To mitigate
this computational bottleneck, we develop an algorithm called FoodMatch, which
maps the vehicle assignment problem to that of minimum weight perfect matching
on a bipartite graph. To further reduce the quadratic construction cost of the
bipartite graph, we deploy best-first search to only compute a subgraph that is
highly likely to contain the minimum matching. The solution quality is further
enhanced by reducing batching to a graph clustering problem and anticipating
dynamic positions of vehicles through angular distance. Extensive experiments
on food-delivery data from large metropolitan cities establish that FoodMatch
is substantially better than baseline strategies on a number of metrics, while
being efficient enough to handle real-world workloads.

Moreover, it is assumed that the players have no access to the explicit

problem, a discrete-time gradient-free Nash equilibrium seeking strategy, based
on the gradient tracking method, is proposed. Specifically, a gradient

With a sufficiently small constant step-size, we show that all players' actions

various age groups given a limited amount of speech. Moreover, the speech being
spontaneous has false starts transcribed as partial words, which in the test
transcriptions leads to unseen partial words. To cope with these two
challenges, we investigate a data augmentation-based approach. Firstly, we
apply the prosody-based data augmentation to supplement the audio data.
Secondly, we simulate false starts by introducing partial-word noise in the
language modeling corpora creating new words. Acoustic models trained on
prosody-based augmented data outperform the models using the baseline recipe or
the SpecAugment-based augmentation. The partial-word noise also helps to
improve the baseline language model. Our ASR system, a combination of these
schemes, is placed third in the evaluation period and achieves the word error
rate of 18.71%. Post-evaluation period, we observe that increasing the amounts
of prosody-based augmented data leads to better performance. Furthermore,

Hamiltonian amorphous elastic solids, the stress autocorrelation matrix
presents long range anisotropic contributions just as elastic Green's
functions. We find that in a standard model of frictional granular packing this
is not the case. We prove quite generally that mechanical balance and material
isotropy constrain the stress auto-correlation matrix to be fully determined by
two spatially isotropic functions: the pressure and torque auto-correlations.
The pressure and torque fluctuations being respectively normal and hyperuniform
force the stress autocorrelation to decay as the elastic Green's function.
Since we find the torque fluctuations to be hyper-uniform, the culprit is the
pressure whose fluctuations decay slower than normally as a function of the
system's size. Investigating the reason for these abnormal pressure
fluctuations we discover that anomalous correlations build up already during
the compression of the dilute system before jamming. Once jammed these
correlations remain frozen. Whether this is true for frictional matter in
general or is it the consequence of the model properties is a question that
must await experimental scrutiny and possible alternative models.

functions, which allow for flexible modeling of both covariance operators and
marginal structures. The proposed framework can guarantee that the resulting
estimator is automatically semi-positive definite, and can incorporate various
spectral regularizations. The trace-norm regularization in particular can
promote low ranks for both covariance operator and marginal structures. Despite
the lack of a closed form, under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator can
achieve unified theoretical results that hold for any relative magnitudes
between the sample size and the number of observations per sample field, and
the rate of convergence reveals the ""phase-transition"" phenomenon from sparse

axion electrodynamics and geometric optics are in good agreement, with
refraction occurring at $\mathcal{O}(g_{a \gamma \gamma}^2)$. However, for rays

down and the dominant refraction requires a full wave-optical treatment,
occurring at $\mathcal{O}(g_{a \gamma \gamma})$. In the presence of

benefits is to mitigate the privacy risks as the learning of algorithms can be
achieved without collecting or sharing data. While federated learning (i.e.,
many based on stochastic gradient algorithms) has shown great promise, there
are still many challenging problems in protecting privacy, especially during
the process of gradients update and exchange. This paper presents the first
gradient-free federated learning framework called GRAFFL for learning a
Bayesian generative model based on approximate Bayesian computation. Unlike
conventional federated learning algorithms based on gradients, our framework
does not require to disassemble a model (i.e., to linear components) or to
perturb data (or encryption of data for aggregation) to preserve privacy.
Instead, this framework uses implicit information derived from each
participating institution to learn posterior distributions of parameters. The
implicit information is summary statistics derived from SuffiAE that is a
neural network developed in this study to create compressed and linearly
separable representations thereby protecting sensitive information from
leakage. As a sufficient dimensionality reduction technique, this is proved to
provide sufficient summary statistics. We propose the GRAFFL-based Bayesian
Gaussian mixture model to serve as a proof-of-concept of the framework. Using
several datasets, we demonstrated the feasibility and usefulness of our model
in terms of privacy protection and prediction performance (i.e., close to an
ideal setting). The trained model as a quasi-global model can generate
informative samples involving information from other institutions and enhances
data analysis of each institution.

relation to a class of block structured Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) called
$2$-stage stochastic. A $2$-stage stochastic ILP is an integer program of the
form $\min \{c^T x \mid \mathcal{A} x = b, \ell \leq x \leq u, x \in
\mathbb{Z}^{r + ns} \}$ where the constraint matrix $\mathcal{A} \in
\mathbb{Z}^{nt \times r +ns}$ consists of $n$ matrices $A_i \in \mathbb{Z}^{t
\times r}$ on the vertical line and $n$ matrices $B_i \in \mathbb{Z}^{t \times
s}$ on the diagonal line aside.
  First, we show a stronger hardness result for a number theoretic problem
called Quadratic Congruences where the objective is to compute a number $z \leq
\gamma$ satisfying $z^2 \equiv \alpha \bmod \beta$ for given $\alpha, \beta,
\gamma \in \mathbb{Z}$. This problem was proven to be NP-hard already in 1978
by Manders and Adleman. However, this hardness only applies for instances where
the prime factorization of $\beta$ admits large multiplicities of each prime
number. We circumvent this necessity proving that the problem remains NP-hard,
even if each prime number only occurs constantly often.
  Then, using this new hardness result for the Quadratic Congruences problem,
we prove a lower bound of $2^{2^{\delta(s+t)}} |I|^{O(1)}$ for some $\delta >
0$ for the running time of any algorithm solving $2$-stage stochastic ILPs
assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). Here, $|I|$ is the encoding
length of the instance. This result even holds if $r$, $||b||_{\infty}$,
$||c||_{\infty}, ||\ell||_{\infty}$ and the largest absolute value $\Delta$ in
the constraint matrix $\mathcal{A}$ are constant. This shows that the
state-of-the-art algorithms are nearly tight. Further, it proves the suspicion
that these ILPs are indeed harder to solve than the closely related $n$-fold
ILPs where the contraint matrix is the transpose of $\mathcal A$.

reduce with reduction in the growth temperature. Films grown at 600 {\deg}C
show an electron concentration of 9.7 x 1012 cm-2 and a FWHM of 3.2 nm. High
resolution scanning/transmission electron microscopy of the epitaxial film did
not reveal any significant observable degradation in crystal quality of the
delta sheet and surrounding regions. Hall measurements of delta-doped film on
Fe-doped substrate showed a sheet charge density of 6.1 x 1012 cm-2 and carrier
mobility of 83 cm2/V. s. Realization of sharp delta doping profiles in

the wireless channels by controlling individual scattering elements' phase
shifts, namely, passive beamforming. Due to the large size of scattering
elements, the passive beamforming is typically challenged by the high
computational complexity and inexact channel information. In this article, we
focus on machine learning (ML) approaches for performance maximization in
IRS-assisted wireless networks. In general, ML approaches provide enhanced
flexibility and robustness against uncertain information and imprecise
modeling. Practical challenges still remain mainly due to the demand for a
large dataset in offline training and slow convergence in online learning.
These observations motivate us to design a novel optimization-driven ML
framework for IRS-assisted wireless networks, which takes both advantages of
the efficiency in model-based optimization and the robustness in model-free ML
approaches. By splitting the decision variables into two parts, one part is
obtained by the outer-loop ML approach, while the other part is optimized
efficiently by solving an approximate problem. Numerical results verify that
the optimization-driven ML approach can improve both the convergence and the

Optimization of the flux pump used in the conduction-cooling system is that a
constantan heater was added to keep the temperature of the pumping bridge at a
certain value. Excitation effects of the YBCO coil at different temperatures
were investigated in the conduction-cooling system. A fast-increasing of
pumping current in the YBCO coil occurs when the temperature of the YBCO sheet

between saturated pumping current and input voltage, working frequency, numbers

saturated current can reach 155 A when the frequency is 20 Hz and the voltage

Here, we perform a joint Fisher analysis of the tSZ power spectrum and
bispectrum to verify how much the full bispectrum can contribute to improve
parameter constraints. We go beyond similar studies of this kind in several
respects: first of all, we include the complete power spectrum and bispectrum
(auto- and cross-) covariance in the analysis, computing all NG contributions;
furthermore we consider a multi-component foreground scenario and model the
effects of component separation in the forecasts; finally, we consider an
extended set of both cosmological and intra-cluster medium parameters. We show
that the tSZ bispectrum is very efficient at breaking parameter degeneracies,
making it able to produce even stronger cosmological constraints than the tSZ
power spectrum: e.g. the standard deviation on $\sigma_8$ shrinks from
$\sigma^\text{PS}(\sigma_8)=0.35$ to $\sigma^\text{BS}(\sigma_8)=0.065$ when we
consider a multi-parameter analysis. We find that this is mostly due to the
different response of separate triangle types (e.g. equilateral and squeezed)
to changes in model parameters. While weak, this shape dependence is clearly
non-negligible for cosmological parameters, and it is even stronger, as
expected, for intra-cluster medium parameters.

trust game with the trustor's investment and the trustee's return of the
investment as the two key parameters. We study this game on different networks,
including the complete network, random and scale-free networks, and in the
well-mixed limit. We show that in all but one case the network structure has
little effect on the evolution of trust and trustworthiness. Specifically, for
well-mixed populations, lattices, random and scale-free networks, we find that
trust never evolves, while trustworthiness evolves with some probability
depending on the game parameters and the updating dynamics. Only for the
scale-free network with degree non-normalized dynamics, we find parameter
values for which trust evolves but trustworthiness does not, as well as values
for which both trust and trustworthiness evolve. We conclude with a discussion
about mechanisms that could lead to the evolution of trust and outline

study collective migration by considering the signal-dependent coordination of
contractile stress and adhesive friction to the substratum. We show that their
interplay forms a non-reciprocal motion that enhances the backward motion
against a signal wave. Moreover, the relaxation dynamics during this
non-reciprocal motion realize a noise filter by which the migration velocity is
optimized under a certain wave velocity. Our finding thus brings deep

residuals are generally numerically much smaller than the distances among all
the prototypes, the distributions of the unseen-class features synthesized by
the proposed network are less overlapped. In addition, considering that the
visual features from categorization CNNs are generally inconsistent with their
semantic features, a simple feature selection strategy is introduced for
extracting more compact semantic visual features. Extensive experimental
results on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method could achieve a
significantly better performance than existing state-of-the-art methods by

find only small, rather insignificant changes compared to the geodesic case.
For the other two models, on the other hand, there is a fair increase of the
estimated upper limit on the spin. Regarding the QPO model's falsifiability, we
find that one particular model from the examined set is incompatible with the
data. If the microquasar's spectral spin estimates that point to $a>0.65$ were
fully confirmed, two more QPO models would be ruled out. Moreover, if two very
different values of the spin, such as $a\approx 0.65$ in GRO J1655$-$40 vs.
$a\approx 1$ in GRS 1915+105, were confirmed, all the models except one would
remain unsupported by our results. Finally, we discuss the implications for a
model recently proposed in the context of neutron star (NS) QPOs as a
disk-oscillation-based modification of the relativistic precession model. This
model provides overall better fits of the NS data and predicts more realistic
values of the NS mass compared to the relativistic precession model. We
conclude that it also implies a significantly higher upper limit on the

ghosts are benign: there is no collapse and unitarity is not violated.
  As an example, we consider the 3-particle Toda periodic chain, with the cubic
invariant I chosen for the Hamiltonian. The classical trajectories exhibit
regular oscillations, and the spectrum of the quantum Hamiltonian is discrete
running from minus to plus infinity. We also discuss the classical dynamics of
a perturbed system with the Hamiltonian H = I + v, where v is an oscillator

theories involving an infinite number of conservation laws: any of them can be
chosen for the Hamiltonian. We illustrate this for the Sine-Gordon and KdV

acquire matched fully sampled k-space data, since the acquisition of fully
sampled k-space data requires long scan time and often leads to the change of

propose an unpaired deep learning approach using a optimal transport driven
cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (OT-cycleGAN) that employs a
single pair of generator and discriminator. The proposed OT-cycleGAN
architecture is rigorously derived from a dual formulation of the optimal

demonstrated great success in robotics. Previous works usually focus on
learning an end-to-end (direct) policy to directly output joint torques. While
the direct policy seems convenient, the resultant performance may not meet our
expectations. To improve its performance, more sophisticated reward functions
or more structured policies can be utilized. This paper focuses on the latter
because the structured policy is more intuitive and can inherit insights from
previous model-based controllers. It is unsurprising that the structure, such
as a better choice of the action space and constraints of motion trajectory,
may benefit the training process and the final performance of the policy at the
cost of generality, but the quantitative effect is still unclear. To analyze
the effect of the structure quantitatively, this paper investigates three
policies with different levels of structure in learning quadruped locomotion: a
direct policy, a structured policy, and a highly structured policy. The
structured policy is trained to learn a task-space impedance controller and the
highly structured policy learns a controller tailored for trot running, which
we adopt from previous work. To evaluate trained policies, we design a
simulation experiment to track different desired velocities under force
disturbances. Simulation results show that structured policy and highly
structured policy require 1/3 and 3/4 fewer training steps than the direct
policy to achieve a similar level of cumulative reward, and seem more robust
and efficient than the direct policy. We highlight that the structure embedded
in the policies significantly affects the overall performance of learning a
complicated task when complex dynamics are involved, such as legged locomotion.

corrupt them with a synthetic noise model to prevent the convergence of the

strongly-coupled partitioned method for fluid-structure interaction problems.
The flow is assumed to be viscous and incompressible, and the structure is
modeled using linear elastodynamics equations. We assume that the structure is
thick, i.e., modeled using the same number of spatial dimensions as fluid. Our
newly developed numerical method is based on generalized Robin boundary
conditions, as well as on the refactorization of the Cauchy's one-legged
`theta-like' method, written as a sequence of Backward Euler-Forward Euler
steps used to discretize the problem in time. This family of methods,
parametrized by theta, is B-stable for any theta in [0.5,1] and second-order
accurate for theta=0.5+O(tau), where tau is the time step. In the proposed
algorithm, the fluid and structure subproblems, discretized using the Backward
Euler scheme, are first solved iteratively until convergence. Then, the
variables are linearly extrapolated, equivalent to solving Forward Euler
problems. We prove that the iterative procedure is convergent, and that the
proposed method is stable provided theta in [0.5,1]. Numerical examples, based
on the finite element discretization in space, explore convergence rates using
different values of parameters in the problem, and compare our method to other
strongly-coupled partitioned schemes from the literature. We also compare our
method to both a monolithic and a non-iterative partitioned solver on a
benchmark problem with parameters within the physiological range of blood flow,
obtaining an excellent agreement with the monolithic scheme.

used to terminate victim TCP connections or inject forged data into victim TCP
connections by manipulating the new mixed IPID assignment method, which is
widely used in Linux kernel version 4.18 and beyond to help defend against TCP
hijacking attacks. The attack has three steps. First, an off-path attacker can
downgrade the IPID assignment for TCP packets from the more secure
per-socket-based policy to the less secure hash-based policy, building a shared
IPID counter that forms a side channel on the victim. Second, the attacker
detects the presence of TCP connections by observing the shared IPID counter on
the victim. Third, the attacker infers the sequence number and the
acknowledgment number of the detected connection by observing the side channel
of the shared IPID counter. Consequently, the attacker can completely hijack
the connection, i.e., resetting the connection or poisoning the data stream.
  We evaluate the impacts of this off-path TCP attack in the real world. Our
case studies of SSH DoS, manipulating web traffic, and poisoning BGP routing

results show that our off-path TCP attack can be constructed within 215 seconds

to a second transverse traveling sound wave imposes an additional acoustical
force that drives the sphere away from its mechanical equilibrium. The driving
force is shaped by interference between the standing trapping wave and the
traveling driving. If, furthermore, the traveling wave is detuned from the
standing wave, the driving force oscillates at the difference frequency. Far
from behaving like a textbook driven harmonic oscillator, however, the
wave-driven harmonic oscillator instead exhibits a remarkably rich variety of
dynamical behaviors arising from the spatial dependence of the driving force.
These include oscillations at both harmonics and subharmonics of the driving
frequency, period-doubling routes to chaos and Fibonacci cascades. This model
system therefore illustrates opportunities for dynamic acoustical manipulation
based on spectral control of the sound field, rather than spatial control.

is important for deploying models to realistic applications. However, most
defense methods are designed to defend against intensity perturbations and
ignore location perturbations, which should be equally important for deep model
security. In this paper, we focus on adversarial deformations, a typical class
of location perturbations, and propose a flow gradient regularization to
improve the resistance of models. Theoretically, we prove that, compared with
input gradient regularization, regularizing flow gradients is able to get a
tighter bound. Over multiple datasets, architectures, and adversarial
deformations, our empirical results indicate that models trained with flow
gradients can acquire a better resistance than trained with input gradients
with a large margin, and also better than adversarial training. Moreover,
compared with directly training with adversarial deformations, our method can
achieve better results in unseen attacks, and combining these two methods can
improve the resistance further.

spreading. For an entity that has completely eliminated the virus domestically,
and resumes ""normal"", very strict pre-departure screening and test and

From SIR type models only the model without vital dynamics has an exact
analytic solution, which can be obtained in an exact parametric form. The SIR
model with vital dynamics, the simplest extension of the basic SIR model, does
not admit a closed form representation of the solution. However, in order to
perform the comparison with the epidemiological data accurate representations
of the time evolution of the SIR model with vital dynamics would be very
useful. In the present paper, we obtain first the basic evolution equation of
the SIR model with vital dynamics, which is given by a strongly nonlinear
second order differential equation. Then we obtain a series representation of
the solution of the model, by using the Adomian and Laplace-Adomian
Decomposition Methods to solve the dynamical evolution equation of the model.
The solutions are expressed in the form of infinite series. The series
representations of the time evolution of the SIR model with vital dynamics are
compared with the exact numerical solutions of the model, and we find that, at
least for a specific range of parameters, there is a good agreement between the
Adomian and Laplace-Adomian semianalytical solutions, containing only a small
number of terms, and the numerical results.

the spacing error signal that dictates whether a collision occurs. We address
this discrepancy in the first part of our work, where we reconsider string
stability from a safety perspective and develop an upper limit on the maximum
spacing error in a homogeneous platoon as a function of the acceleration
maneuver of the lead vehicle. In the second part of this paper, we extend our
previous results by providing the minimum achievable time headway for platoons
with two-predecessor lookup schemes experiencing burst-noise packet losses.
Finally, we utilize throttle and brake maps to develop a longitudinal vehicle
model and validate it against a Lincoln MKZ which is then used for numerical
corroboration of the proposed time headway selection algorithms.

early 1990s that reversible computing based on adiabatic switching is possible
in CMOS, although almost all of the ""adiabatic"" CMOS logic families in the
literature are not actually fully adiabatic, which limits their achievable
energy savings. The first CMOS logic style that achieved truly, fully adiabatic
operation if leakage was negligible (CRL) is not fully static, which leads to a
number of practical engineering difficulties in the presence of certain
nonidealities. Later, ""static"" adiabatic logic families were described, but
they were not actually fully adiabatic, or fully static, and were much slower.
  In this paper, we describe a new logic family, Static 2-Level Adiabatic Logic
(S2LAL), which is, to our knowledge, the first CMOS logic family that is both
fully static, and truly, fully adiabatic (modulo leakage). In addition, S2LAL
is, we think, the fastest possible such family (among fully pipelined
sequential circuits), having a latency per logic stage of one ""tick""
(transition time), and a minimum clock period (initiation interval) of 8 ticks.
S2LAL requires 8 phases of a trapezoidal power-clock waveform (plus constant
power and ground references) to be supplied. We argue that, if implemented in a
suitable fabrication process designed to aggressively minimize leakage, S2LAL
should be capable of demonstrating a greater level of energy efficiency than
any other semiconductor-based digital logic family known today.

setup with radiative cooling. The relative motion between the dense cloud and
the diffuse medium produces a turbulent boundary layer of mixed gas with a
short cooling time. This mixed gas may explain the ubiquity of the range of
absorption/emission lines observed in various sources such as the
circumgalactic medium and galactic/stellar/AGN outflows. Recently Gronke & Oh
showed that the efficient radiative cooling of the mixed gas can lead to the
continuous growth of the dense cloud. They presented a threshold cloud size for
the growth of dense gas which was contradicted by the more recent works of Li
et al. & Sparre et al. These thresholds are qualitatively different as the
former is based on the cooling time of the mixed gas whereas the latter is
based on the cooling time of the hot gas. Our simulations agree with the
threshold based on the cooling time of the mixed gas. We argue that the
radiative cloud-crushing simulations should be run long enough to allow for the

long that the background gas cools catastrophically. Moreover, the simulation
domain should be large enough that the mixed gas is not lost through the
boundaries. While the mixing layer is roughly isobaric, the emissivity of the
gas at different temperatures is fundamentally different from an isobaric
single-phase steady cooling flow.

materials. Such states must propagate along the edges of the bulk either
clockwise or counterclockwise, and thus produce oppositely propagating edge
states along the two parallel edges of a strip sample. However, recent theories
have predicted a counterintuitive picture, where the two edge states at the two
parallel strip edges can propagate in the same direction; these anomalous
topological edge states are named as antichiral edge states. Here we report the
experimental observation of antichiral edge states in a gyromagnetic photonic
crystal. The crystal consists of gyromagnetic cylinders in a honeycomb lattice,
with the two triangular sublattices magnetically biased in opposite directions.
With microwave measurement, unique properties of antichiral edge states have
been observed directly, which include the titled dispersion, the chiral-like
robust propagation in samples with certain shapes, and the scattering into
backward bulk states at certain terminations. These results extend and
supplement the current understanding of chiral edge states.

one has to evaluate the usefulness of electronic properties of B and N doped

perturbation theory(DFPT) to calculate the inter-atomic forces=force constants
of pristine/doped graphene. Thermal conductivity calculations have been carried
out by making use of linearized Boltzmann transport equations (LBTE) under
single-mode relaxation time approximation (RTA). The thermal conductivity of
pristine graphene has been found to be of the order of 4000W/mK at 100K, which
decreases gradually with an increase in temperature. The thermal conductivity
decreases drastically by 96 % to 190 W/mK when doped with 12.5 % B and reduces
by 99 % to 30 W/mK with 25 % B doping. When graphene is doped with N, the
thermal conductivity decreases to 4 W/mK and 55 W/mK for 12.5 % and 25 % doping
concentration, respectively. We have found that the thermal conductivity of
doped graphene show less sensitivity to change in temperature. It has also been
shown that the thermal conductivity of graphene can be tuned with doping and
has a strong dependence on doping concentration.

turns out, this space reduction could be understood as another definition of
inflation. It is shown that the introduction of the non-associativity of the
algebra of physical fields in a homogeneous space leads to a nonlinear
equation, the solutions of which can be considered as two-stage inflation.
Using the example of reduction $T\times R^7$ to $T\times R^3$, it is shown that
there is a continuous cross-linking of the Friedmann and inflationary stages of
algebraic inflation at times $10^{-15}$ with the number of baryons $10^{80}$ in

  and optimal windspeed","7 figures",,"10.1142/S0129183121500443",,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We discuss the effects of spatial interference between two infectious
hotspots as a function of the mobility of individuals (wind speed) between the
two and their relative degree of infectivity. As long as the upstream hotspot
is less contagious than the downstream one, increasing the wind speed leads to
a monotonic decrease of the infection peak in the downstream hotspot. Once the
upstream hotspot becomes about between twice and five times more infectious
than the downstream one, an optimal wind speed emerges, whereby a local minimum
peak intensity is attained in the downstream hotspot, along with a local
maximum beyond which the beneficial effect of the wind is restored. Since this
non-monotonic trend is reminiscent of the equation of state of non-ideal f
luids, we dub the above phenomena epidemic condensation. When the relative
infectivity of the upstream hotspot exceeds about a factor five, the beneficial
effect of the wind above the optimal speed is completely lost: any wind speed
above the optimal one leads to a higher infection peak. It is also found that
spatial correlation between the two hotspots decay much more slowly than their
inverse distance. It is hoped that the above findings may offer a qualitative
clue for optimal confinement policies between different cities and urban
agglomerates.

and regional transportation networks throughout the United States, especially
the Motor City: Detroit. That was mainly a result of swift restrictive measures
such as statewide quarantine and lock-down orders to confine the spread of the
virus. This work is driven by analyzing five types of real-world data sets from
Detroit related to traffic volume, daily cases, weather, social distancing
index, and crashes from January 2019 to June 2020. The primary goal is figuring
out the impacts of COVID-19 on the transportation network usage (traffic
volume) and safety (crashes) for the Detroit, exploring the potential
correlation between these diverse data features, and determining whether each
type of data (e.g., traffic volume data) could be a useful factor in the
confirmed-cases prediction. In addition, a deep learning model was developed
using long short-term memory networks to predict the number of confirmed cases
within the next one week. The model demonstrated a promising prediction result
with a coefficient of determination (R^2) of up to approximately 0.91.
Moreover, in order to provide statistical evaluation measures of confirmed-case
prediction and to quantify the prediction effectiveness of each type of data,
the prediction results of six feature groups are presented and analyzed.
Furthermore, six essential observations with supporting evidence and analyses
are presented. The goal of this paper is to present a proposed approach which
can be applied, customised, adjusted, and replicated for analysis of the impact
of COVID-19 on a transportation network and prediction of the anticipated
COVID-19 cases using a similar data set obtained for other large cities in the
USA or from around the world.
