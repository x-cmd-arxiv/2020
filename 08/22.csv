it is demonstrated that the RIS application is particularly suitable to
increase the achievable rate in an indoor environment, as in this case even a

half-mass radii $R_\mathrm{h} \lesssim 1 pc$, central densities
$\rho_\mathrm{core} \gtrsim 10^5 M_\odot pc^{-3}$, and resolved stellar
populations with 10\% primordial binaries. Very massive stars (VMSs) with
masses up to $\sim 400 M_\odot$ grow rapidly by binary exchange and three-body
scattering events with main sequences stars in hard binaries. Assuming that in
VMS - stellar BH collisions all stellar material is accreted onto the BH, IMBHs
with masses up to $M_\mathrm{BH} \sim 350 M_\odot$ can form on timescales of
$\lesssim 15$ Myr. This process was qualitatively predicted from Monte Carlo
MOCCA simulations. Despite the stochastic nature of the process - typically not
more than 3/8 cluster realisations show IMBH formation - we find indications
for higher formation efficiencies in more compact clusters. Assuming a lower
accretion fraction of 0.5 for VMS - BH collisions, IMBHs can also form. The
process might not work for accretion fractions as low as 0.1. After formation,
the IMBHs can experience occasional mergers with stellar mass BHs in
intermediate mass-ratio inspiral events (IMRIs) on a 100 Myr timescale.
Realised with more than $10^5$ stars, 10 \% binaries, the assumed stellar
evolution model with all relevant evolution processes included and 300 Myr

hundred solar masses might form rapidly in massive star clusters right after
their birth while they are still compact.

consists of determining a measure of deformation (i.e.strain) of soft tissue in
response to an applied mechanical force. The strain is generally determined by
estimating the displacement between successive ultrasound frames acquired
before and after applying manual compression. The computational efficiency and
accuracy of the displacement prediction, also known as time-delay estimation,
are key challenges for real-time USE applications. In this paper, we present a
novel deep-learning method for efficient time-delay estimation between
ultrasound radio-frequency (RF) data. The proposed method consists of a
convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts a displacement field between a
pair of pre- and post-compression ultrasound RF frames. The network is trained
in an unsupervised way, by optimizing a similarity metric be-tween the
reference and compressed image. We also introduce a new regularization term
that preserves displacement continuity by directly optimizing the strain
smoothness. We validated the performance of our method by using both ultrasound
simulation and in vivo data on healthy volunteers. We also compared the
performance of our method with a state-of-the-art method called OVERWIND [17].
Average contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of our
method in 30 simulation and 3 in vivo image pairs are 7.70 and 6.95, 7 and
0.31, respectively. Our results suggest that our approach can effectively
predict accurate strain images. The unsupervised aspect of our approach
represents a great potential for the use of deep learning application for the
analysis of clinical ultrasound data.

for other algorithms. Applications of such algorithms can be found in
communication systems involving design of networks for efficient information
dissemination to a target group, targeted drug-delivery where drug molecules
search for the affected site before diffusing, and high-value target
localization with a network of drones. In several of such applications, the
agents face a hostile environment that can result in loss of agents during the
search. Such a loss changes the communication topology of the agents and hence
the information available to agents, ultimately influencing the performance of
the algorithm. In this paper, we present a study of the impact of loss of
agents on the performance of such algorithms as a function of the initial

objective function with multiple sub-optimal regions in a hostile environment
and study its performance for a range of network topologies with loss of

this performance using a set of heuristics, and produces suggestions of
possible interaction designs. Heuristics account for properties of the
interaction (e.g., target and event type) as well as the visualization (e.g.,
mark and scale types, and multiple views). Interaction design suggestions are
displayed as thumbnails; users can preview and test these suggestions,
iteratively refine them through additional demonstrations, and finally apply
and customize them via property inspectors. To evaluate our approach, we
instantiate it in Lyra, an existing visualization design environment. We
demonstrate its expressive extent with a gallery of diverse examples, and
evaluate its usability through a first-use study and via an analysis of its

(LOS) effects can strongly affect the interpretation of the data, especially in
regions just above the limb. We present a semi-empirical forward model, called
GHOSTS, to characterize these effects. GHOSTS uses inputs from several other
models to compute non-equilibrium ionization states (which include the
solar-wind freezing-in effect) for many ions. These are used to generate
ensembles of simulated spectral lines that are examined in detail, with
emphasis on: (1) relationships between quantities derived from observables and
the radial variation of the observed quantities, (2) the behavior of thermal
and non-thermal components of the line width, and (3) relative contributions of
collisionally excited and radiatively scattered photons. We find that rapidly
changing temperatures in the low corona can cause ion populations to vary
dramatically with height. This can lead to line-width measurements that are
constant with height (a ""plateau"" effect) even when the temperature is
increasing rapidly, as the plane-of-sky becomes evacuated and the
foreground/background plasma dominates the observation. We find that LOS
effects often drive the velocity width to be close to the plane-of-sky value of
the wind speed, despite it flowing perpendicularly to the LOS there. The
plateau effect can also cause the non-thermal component of the line width to
greatly exceed the solar wind velocity at the observation height. Lastly, we
study how much of the LOS is significant to the observation, and the importance
of including continuum in the solar spectrum when computing the radiatively
scattered emission.

available and these can be used to determine the chemical composition and
evolution of the Galaxy with unprecedented precision. One of the major
challenges in this endeavour involves constructing realistic models of stellar
spectra with which to reliably determine stellar abundances. At present, large
stellar surveys commonly use simplified models that assume that the stellar
atmospheres are approximately in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). To test
and ultimately relax this assumption, we have performed non-LTE calculations
for $13$ different elements (H, Li, C, N, O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Mn, and
Ba), using recent model atoms that have physically-motivated descriptions for
the inelastic collisions with neutral hydrogen, across a grid of $3756$ 1D
MARCS model atmospheres that spans $3000\leq
T_{\mathrm{eff}}/\mathrm{K}\leq8000$,
$-0.5\leq\log{g/\mathrm{cm\,s^{-2}}}\leq5.5$, and $-5\leq\mathrm{[Fe/H]}\leq1$.
We present the grids of departure coefficients that have been implemented into
the GALAH DR3 analysis pipeline in order to complement the extant non-LTE grid
for iron. We also present a detailed line-by-line re-analysis of $50126$ stars
from GALAH DR3. We found that relaxing LTE can change the abundances by between
$-0.7\,\mathrm{dex}$ and $+0.2\,\mathrm{dex}$ for different lines and stars.
Taking departures from LTE into account can reduce the dispersion in the
$\mathrm{[A/Fe]}$ versus $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}$ plane by up to $0.1\,\mathrm{dex}$,
and it can remove spurious differences between the dwarfs and giants by up to
$0.2\,\mathrm{dex}$. The resulting abundance slopes can thus be qualitatively
different in non-LTE, possibly with important implications for the chemical
evolution of our Galaxy.

naturally in the setting of complex algebraic geometry, via the Segre
embedding. This is a map describing how to take products of projective Hilbert
spaces. In this paper, we show that for pure states of n particles, the
corresponding Segre embedding may be described by means of a directed hypercube
of dimension n-1, where all edges are bipartite-type Segre maps. Moreover, we
describe the image of the original Segre map via the intersections of images of
the n-1 edges whose target is the last vertex of the hypercube. This purely
algebraic result is then transferred to physics. For each of the last edges of
the Segre hypercube, we introduce an observable which measures geometric
separability and is related to the trace of the squared reduced density matrix.
As a consequence, the hypercube approach gives a novel viewpoint on measuring
entanglement, naturally relating bipartitions with $q$-partitions for q>1. We
test our observables against well-known states, showing that these provide
well-behaved and fine measures of entanglement.

cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) images has achieved a level of

segmentations can lack spatial coherence, including spurious connected

topology of image segments, which is frequently known a priori. Addressing this
challenge, published work has employed persistent homology, constructing
topological loss functions for the evaluation of image segments against an

is to extract either one or more target speech signals, respectively, from a

been tackled using signal processing and machine learning techniques applied to
the available acoustic signals. Since the visual aspect of speech is
essentially unaffected by the acoustic environment, visual information from the
target speakers, such as lip movements and facial expressions, has also been
used for speech enhancement and speech separation systems. In order to
efficiently fuse acoustic and visual information, researchers have exploited
the flexibility of data-driven approaches, specifically deep learning,
achieving strong performance. The ceaseless proposal of a large number of
techniques to extract features and fuse multimodal information has highlighted
the need for an overview that comprehensively describes and discusses
audio-visual speech enhancement and separation based on deep learning. In this
paper, we provide a systematic survey of this research topic, focusing on the
main elements that characterise the systems in the literature: acoustic
features; visual features; deep learning methods; fusion techniques; training
targets and objective functions. In addition, we review deep-learning-based
methods for speech reconstruction from silent videos and audio-visual sound
source separation for non-speech signals, since these methods can be more or
less directly applied to audio-visual speech enhancement and separation.
Finally, we survey commonly employed audio-visual speech datasets, given their
central role in the development of data-driven approaches, and evaluation
methods, because they are generally used to compare different systems and

being the most common ones. Here we investigate the improvement brought by
using initial conditions based on third-order Lagrangian perturbation theory
(3LPT). We show that with 3LPT, truncation errors are vastly suppressed,
thereby opening the portal to initializing simulations accurately as late as
z=12 (for the resolution we consider). We analyse the competing effects of
perturbative truncation and particle discreteness on various summary

strongly amplified for earlier initialization times. We show that late starting
times with 3LPT provide the most accurate configuration, which we find to
coincide with the continuum fluid limit within 1 per cent for the power- and
bispectrum at z=0 up to the particle Nyquist wave number of our simulations (k
~ 3h/Mpc). In conclusion, to suppress non-fluid artefacts, we recommend
initializing simulations as late as possible with 3LPT. We make our 3LPT

challenging task, particularly when the system is composed of more fine-grained
services, such as service function chains. An important QoS metric in service
systems is the end-to-end delay, which becomes even more important in
delay-sensitive applications, where the jobs must be completed within a time
deadline. Admission control is one way of providing end-to-end delay guarantee,
where the controller accepts a job only if it has a high probability of meeting
the deadline. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based
admission controller that guarantees a probabilistic upper-bound on the
end-to-end delay of the service system, while minimizes the probability of
unnecessary rejections. Our controller only uses the queue length information
of the network and requires no knowledge about the network topology or system
parameters. Since long-term performance metrics are of great importance in
service systems, we take an average-reward reinforcement learning approach,
which is well suited to infinite horizon problems. Our evaluations verify that
the proposed RL-based admission controller is capable of providing
probabilistic bounds on the end-to-end delay of the network, without using
system model information.

between two-parties of a multipartite state is assumed to be free since there
exist states for which CCs for each of the reduced states can simultaneously
reach their algebraic maximum value. However, when one randomly picks out
states from the state space, we find that the probability of obtaining those
states possessing the algebraic maximum value is vanishingly small. We explore
the possibility of nontrivial upper bound by Haar uniformly generating random
multipartite states and computing the frequency distribution for various CC
measures, conventional classical correlators, and two axiomatic measures of
classical correlations, namely the classical part of quantum discord and local
work of work-deficit. We find that the distributions are typically
Gaussian-like and their standard deviations decrease with the increase in
number of parties. It also reveals that among the multiqubit random states,
most of the reduced density matrices possess a low amount of CCs which can also
be confirmed by the mean of the distributions, thereby showing a kind of
restrictions on the sharability of classical correlations for random states.
Furthermore, we also notice that the maximal value for random states is much
lower than the algebraic maxima obtained for a set of states, and the gap
between the two increases further for states with a higher number of parties.
We report that for a higher number of parties, the classical part of quantum
discord and local work can follow monogamy-based upper bound on sharability
while classical correlators have a different upper bound. The trends of
sharability for classical correlation measures in random states clearly
demarcate between the axiomatic definition of classical correlations and the
conventional ones.

  The study of hyperbolic polynomials dates back to the early 20th century when
used to solve PDEs by G{\aa}rding [G{\aa}r59]. In recent years, more
applications are found in control theory, optimization, real algebraic
geometry, and so on. In particular, the breakthrough result by Marcus,
Spielman, and Srivastava [MSS15] uses the theory of hyperbolic polynomials to
prove the Kadison-Singer conjecture [KS59], which is closely related to
discrepancy theory.
  In this paper, we present a list of new results for hyperbolic polynomials:
  * We show two nearly optimal hyperbolic Chernoff bounds: one for Rademacher
sum of arbitrary vectors and another for random vectors in the hyperbolic cone.
  * We show a hyperbolic anti-concentration bound.
  * We generalize the hyperbolic Kadison-Singer theorem [Br\""a18] for vectors
in sub-isotropic position, and prove a hyperbolic Spencer theorem for any
constant hyperbolic rank vectors.
  The classical matrix Chernoff and discrepancy results are based on
determinant polynomial. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first
work that shows either concentration or anti-concentration results for

quantum emission in liquid crystals by varying the temperature in the
vicinities of the crystalline-to-nematic phase transition, for both the

of the critical exponent that characterizes such a transition, which we show
not only to be independent of the inertial or dissipative dynamics, but also to
be in good agreement with experiments. We determine the orientation of the

spontaneous emission, paving the way to achieve directionality of the emitted
radiation, a result that could be applied in tuneable photonic devices such as
metasurfaces and tuneable light sources.

radiation, and water-oxygen-iron geochemistry. We present MagmOc, a versatile
magma ocean evolution model, validated against the rocky Super-Earth GJ 1132b

TRAPPIST-1 e, f, and g for a range of tidal and radiogenic heating rates, as
well as initial water contents between 1 and 100 Earth oceans. We also
reanalyze the structures of these planets and find they have water mass

respectively. Our model does not make a strong prediction about the water and
oxygen content of the atmosphere of TRAPPIST-1 e at the time of mantle

1-form symmetry of these 6d and 5d theories is captured by those elements of

that some massive BPS excitations, which includes the BPS instantons, are

result, some studies suggest that mobile traffic may increase more than 1000
times compared to the amount of traffic that is generated nowadays. This means
that network resources for mobile services must be managed and controlled in a
smart way, because resources are always limited, but the demand for services
and the need for keeping user equipment always connected to mobile networks can
be considered unlimited, leaving gap between huge service demands and available
resources. In order to narrow this gap, major consideration should be given to
the management of network resources to avoid network congestion and performance
degradation during peak hour/s and traffic spikes, and allow access to network
services to more customers when demand is high. On the other hand, guaranteeing
quality of service requirements for the wide range of new services is another
challenge that must be met in 5G networks. In this paper we will review 5G

introduced the cosmographic approach which allows us to express the free

theoretical bounds on the model parameters allowing the future deceleration of
the universe. Moreover, using the observational bounds on the cosmographic

examined the chance of a decelerating phase of the universe. Finally,
considering a variety of known cosmological models and parametrizations, we
have tested the same possibility. Our analysis shows that the chance of a
future decelerating expansion of the universe is highly dependent on the choice
of the cosmological models and parametrizations and also on the observational
data. Even though the future decelerating expansion is allowed in some
cosmological frameworks, but we do not see any strong evidence in favor of
this. Perhaps, the future cosmological surveys could offer some more
information regarding the fate of the universe.

Yang-Mills theory, gravity, and related field theories. Previous work has shown
that this has an explicit realisation in self-dual YM theory, where the
equation of motion can be written in a form that maps directly to Pleba\'nski's
heavenly equation for self-dual gravity. The self-dual YM equation involves an
area-preserving diffeomorphism algebra, two copies of which appear in the
heavenly equation. In this paper, we show that this construction is a special
case of a wider family of heavenly-type examples, by (i) performing Moyal
deformations, and (ii) replacing the area-preserving diffeomorphisms with a
less restricted algebra. As a result, we obtain a double-copy interpretation
for hyper-Hermitian manifolds, extending the previously known hyper-K\""ahler
case. We also introduce a double-Moyal deformation of the heavenly equation.
The examples where the construction of Lax pairs is possible are manifestly
consistent with Ward's conjecture, and suggest that the classical integrability
of the gravity-type theory may be guaranteed in general by the integrability of
at least one of two gauge-theory-type single copies.

apply a low-pass filter (e.g., Gaussian blur) before downsampling. However, it
can be suboptimal to apply the same filter across the entire content, as the
frequency of feature maps can vary across both spatial locations and feature

In this work we discuss the prospects of the Large Hadron electron Collider
(LHeC) to detect scalar particles with masses $\gtrsim$ 10 GeV produced from
decays of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson. These scalar particles decay
mainly to bottom pairs, and in a vast portion of the allowed parameter space
they acquire a macroscopic lifetime, hence giving rise to displaced hadronic
vertices. The LHeC provides a very clean environment that allows for easy
identification of these final states, in contrast to hadronic colliders where
the overwhelming backgrounds and high pile-up render such searches incredibly
challenging. We find that the LHeC provides a unique window of opportunity to
detect scalar particles with masses between 10 GeV and half the SM Higgs mass.
In the Higgs Portal scenarios we can test the mixing angle squared, $\sin^2
\alpha$, as low as $10^{-5} - 10^{-7}$, with the exact value depending on the
vacuum expectation value of the new scalar.
  Our results are also presented in a model-independent fashion in the

exotic branching ratios of the Higgs boson at the sub-percent level can be

$\sigma_8$ is a measure of the amplitude of matter fluctuations on 8
$h^{-1}$Mpc scales -- is $\sim3\sigma$ discrepant with the value reconstructed
from cosmic microwave background (CMB) data assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model. In
this article, we show that it is possible to resolve the tension if dark matter
(DM) decays with a lifetime of $\Gamma^{-1} \simeq 55 \ \text{Gyrs}$ into one
massless and one massive product, and transfers a fraction $\varepsilon\simeq
0.7 \ \%$ of its rest mass energy to the massless component. The velocity-kick
received by the massive daughter leads to a suppression of gravitational
clustering below its free-streaming length, thereby reducing the $\sigma_8$
value as compared to that inferred from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, in a
similar fashion to massive neutrino and standard warm DM. Contrarily to the
latter scenarios, the time-dependence of the power suppression and the
free-streaming scale allows the 2-body decaying DM scenario to accommodate CMB,
baryon acoustic oscillation, growth factor and un-calibrated supernova Ia data.
We briefly discuss implications for DM model building, galactic small-scale

the growth factor to high accuracy at $0\lesssim z\lesssim1$ can further test

dynamics are in principle possible even in linear models if the matrices
defining the models are non-normal, as characterized by a necessarily
non-orthogonal set of eigenvectors. However, the extent to which non-normality
is responsible for non-monotonic behavior remains an open question. Here, using
a master equation to model the reaction dynamics, we derive a general condition
for observing non-monotonic dynamics of individual species, establishing that
non-normality promotes non-monotonicity but is not a requirement for it. In
contrast, we show that non-normality is a requirement for non-monotonic
dynamics to be observed in the R\'enyi entropy. Using hydrogen combustion as an
example application, we demonstrate that non-monotonic dynamics under
experimental conditions are supported by a linear chain of connected
components, in contrast with the dominance of a single giant component observed
in typical random reaction networks. The exact linearity of the master equation
enables development of rigorous theory and simulations for dynamical networks
of unprecedented size (approaching $10^5$ dynamical variables, even for a

conclusions are expected to hold for other combustion processes, and the

first on transitions driven by the condensation of a subset of fractionalized

phase with intrinsic topological order. All other anyons have nontrivial mutual
statistics with the condensed subset and hence become confined at the anyon
condensation transition. Using a combination of microscopically exact duality
transformations and asymptotically exact real-space renormalization group
techniques applied to these two-dimensional disordered gauge theories, we argue
that the resulting critical scaling behavior is `superuniversal' across a wide
range of such condensation transitions, and is controlled by the same
infinite-randomness fixed point as that of the 2D random transverse-field Ising

functions in (2+1)D disordered interacting systems. We discuss generalizations
of these results to a large class of ground-state and excited-state topological
transitions in systems with intrinsic topological order as well as those where
topological order is either protected or enriched by global symmetries. When

SrTiO3 (FeSe/STO) has revitalized the field of Fe-based superconductors. In the
ultrathin limit, the superconducting transition temperature Tc is increased by
almost an order of magnitude, raising new questions on the pairing mechanism.
As in other unconventional superconductors, antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations
have been proposed as a candidate to mediate SC in this system. Thus, it is
essential to study the evolution of the spin dynamics of FeSe in the ultrathin
limit to elucidate their relationship with superconductivity. Here, we
investigate and compare the spin excitations in bulk and monolayer FeSe grown
on STO using high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) and
quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations. Despite the absence of long-range
magnetic order, bulk FeSe displays dispersive magnetic excitations reminiscent
of other Fe-pnictides. Conversely, the spin excitations in FeSe/STO are gapped,
dispersionless, and significantly hardened relative to the bulk counterpart. By
comparing our RIXS results with simulations of a bilayer Hubbard model, we
connect the evolution of the spin excitations to the Fermiology of the two
systems. The present study reveals a remarkable reconfiguration of spin
excitations in FeSe/STO, which is essential to understand the role of spin
fluctuations in the pairing mechanism.

the Fermi-surface nesting transforms to 3D with nesting vector

fluctuations around the mean limit remain bounded in mean square throughout
training. The upper bound is given by a Monte-Carlo resampling error, with a
variance that that depends on the 2-norm of the underlying measure, which also
controls the generalization error. This motivates the use of this 2-norm as a
regularization term during training. Furthermore, if the mean-field dynamics
converges to a measure that interpolates the training data, we prove that the
asymptotic deviation eventually vanishes in the CLT scaling. We also complement
these results with numerical experiments.

Massive compact galaxies are potential surviving relics of a high-redshift
phase of star formation. Some of these could be nearly unresolved in SDSS
imaging and thus not included in galaxy samples. To overcome this, a sample was
selected from the combination of SDSS and UKIDSS photometry to r<17.8. This was
done using colour-colour selection, and then by obtaining accurate photometric
redshifts (photo-z) using scaled flux matching (SFM). Compared to spectroscopic
redshifts (spec-z), SFM obtained a 1-sigma scatter of 0.0125 with only 0.3%
outliers (Delta:ln(1+z)>0.06). A sample of 163186 galaxies was obtained with
0.04<z<0.15 over 2300 sq.deg. using a combination of spec-z and photo-z.
Following Barro et al., log:Sigma_1.5=log:M_*-1.5log:reff was used to define
compactness. The spectroscopic completeness was 76% for compact galaxies
(log:Sigma_1.5>10.5) compared to 92% for normal-size galaxies. This difference
is primarily attributed to SDSS `fibre collisions' and not the completeness of
the main galaxy sample selection. Using environmental overdensities, this
confirms that compact quiescent galaxies are significantly more likely to be
found in high-density environments compared to normal-size galaxies. By
comparison with a high-redshift sample from 3D-HST, log:Sigma_1.5 distribution
functions show significant evolution, with this being a compelling way to
compare with simulations such as EAGLE. The number density of compact quiescent
galaxies drops by a factor of about 30 from z~2 to log(n/Mpc^-3)=-5.3+-0.4 in
the SDSS-UKIDSS sample. The uncertainty is dominated by the steep cut off in
log:Sigma_1.5, which is demonstrated conclusively using this complete sample.

supernova (SN II) SN 2017ivv (also known as ASASSN-17qp). Located in an
extremely faint galaxy (M$_r=-10.3$ mag), SN 2017ivv shows an unprecedented
evolution during the two years of observations. At early times, the light curve
shows a fast rise ($\sim6-8$ days) to a peak of ${\rm M}^{\rm max}_{g}= -17.84$
mag, followed by a very rapid decline of $7.94\pm0.48$ mag per 100 days in the
$V-$band. The extensive photometric coverage at late phases shows that the
radioactive tail has two slopes, one steeper than that expected from the decay
of $^{56}$Co (between 100 and 350 days), and another slower (after 450 days),
probably produced by an additional energy source. From the bolometric light
curve, we estimated that the amount of ejected $^{56}$Ni is $\sim0.059\pm0.003$
M$\odot$. The nebular spectra of SN 2017ivv show a remarkable transformation
that allows the evolution to be split into three phases: (1) H$\alpha$ strong
phase ($<200$ days); (2) H$\alpha$ weak phase (between 200 and 350 days); and
(3) H$\alpha$ broad phase ($>500$ days). We find that the nebular analysis
favours a binary progenitor and an asymmetric explosion. Finally, comparing the
nebular spectra of SN 2017ivv to models suggests a progenitor with a zero-age
main-sequence mass of 15 -- 17 \Msun.

available - requires the effective use of non-pharmaceutical interventions:
physical distancing, limits on group sizes, mask wearing, etc. To date, such
interventions have neither been uniformly nor systematically implemented in
most countries. For example, even when under strict stay-at-home orders,
numerous jurisdictions granted exceptions and/or were in close proximity to
locations with entirely different regulations in place. Here, we investigate
the impact of such geographic inconsistencies in epidemic control policies by
coupling search and mobility data to a simple mathematical model of SARS-COV2
transmission. Our results show that while stay-at-home orders decrease contacts
in most areas of the US, some specific activities and venues often see an
increase in attendance. Indeed, over the month of March 2020, between 10 and
30% of churches in the US saw increases in attendance; even as the total number
of visits to churches declined nationally. This heterogeneity, where certain
venues see substantial increases in attendance while others close, suggests
that closure can cause individuals to find an open venue, even if that requires
longer-distance travel. And, indeed, the average distance travelled to churches
in the US rose by 13% over the same period. Strikingly, our model reveals that
across a broad range of model parameters, partial measures can often be worse
than none at all where individuals not complying with policies by traveling to
neighboring areas can create epidemics when the outbreak would otherwise have
been controlled. Taken together, our data analysis and modelling results
highlight the potential unintended consequences of inconsistent epidemic
control policies and stress the importance of balancing the societal needs of a
population with the risk of an outbreak growing into a large epidemic.

the Hawking temperature parameter $\gamma$, which relates the energy exchange
between the bulk and the boundary of the Universe, and the matter creation rate
$\Gamma(t)$, must be very small in order to reproduce observational data.

ask how this monoid acts on topological spaces. Given a monoid action on a
topological space, we get an algebra action on each homology group. The main
theorem of this paper explicitly deduces the representation structure of the
homology groups in terms of a natural filtration associated with our
$\textrm{TL}_n$-space. As a corollary of this result, we are able to study
stability phenomena. There is a natural way to define representation stability
in the context of $\textrm{TL}_n(1)$, and the presence of filtrations enables
us to define a notion of topological stability. We are able to deduce that a
filtration-stable sequence of $\textrm{TL}_n$-spaces results in
representation-stable sequence of homology groups. This can be thought of as
the analogue of the statement that the homology of configuration spaces forms a
finitely generated $\textrm{FI}$-module.

purpose, two different power sources were used to produce the plasma jets, with
one of them producing a pulsed high-voltage (HV) output and the other one
producing a pulse-like HV output, which consists of a damped sine HV waveform.
Measurements of plasma parameters were performed for both configurations using
argon and helium as working gases. As a result, if the pulsed power source is
used, significant differences were found in discharge power ($P_{plasma}$),
rotational and vibrational temperatures ($T_r$ and $T_v$, respectively) when
switching from one configuration to the other. On the other hand, using the
pulse-like HV only the $P_{plasma}$ parameter presented significant differences
when switching the electrode's configuration. For the pulsed source it has been
observed that despite the remarkable increase in $P_{plasma}$ when changing
from the double barrier configuration to the single barrier one, the values
obtained for $T_r$ and $T_v$ also increased, but not in the same proportion as
the increase in $P_{plasma}$, which suggests a non-linear dependency between
temperatures and discharge power in the plasma jet. As an example for
application of plasmas in both configurations, tests in an attempt to remove
copper films deposited on alumina substrates were performed and, as a result,
there was significant material removal only when the powered electrode was in
contact with the plasma. As a general conclusion, if higher power is really
required for some application it is better to use this configuration.

metropolitan areas over the world, bike lanes are being planned and constructed
by many municipal governments to promote cycling and protect cyclists.
Traditional bike lane planning approaches often rely on surveys and heuristics.
We develop a general and novel optimization framework to guide the bike lane
planning from bike trajectories. We formalize the bike lane planning problem in
view of the cyclists' utility functions and derive an integer optimization
model to maximize the utility. To capture cyclists' route choices, we develop a
bilevel program based on the Multinomial Logit model. We derive structural
properties about the base model and prove that the Lagrangian dual of the bike
lane planning model is polynomial-time solvable. Furthermore, we reformulate
the route choice based planning model as a mixed integer linear program using a
linear approximation scheme. We develop tractable formulations and efficient
algorithms to solve the large-scale optimization problem. Via a real-world case
study with a city government, we demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed
algorithms and quantify the trade-off between the coverage of bike trips and
continuity of bike lanes. We show how the network topology evolves according to
the utility functions and highlight the importance of understanding cyclists'

One World Terrain (OWT) project with a variety of landscapes (i.e., various

qualities (i.e., flight altitudes and overlap between images). Although the
database is considerably larger than existing databases, it remains unknown
whether deep-learning algorithms have truly achieved their full potential in

currently lacking. Obtaining large annotated 3D point-cloud databases is
time-consuming and labor-intensive, not only from a data annotation perspective
in which the data must be manually labeled by well-trained personnel, but also
from a raw data collection and processing perspective. Furthermore, it is
generally difficult for segmentation models to differentiate objects, such as
buildings and tree masses, and these types of scenarios do not always exist in

data quality issues in the aircraft-based photogrammetric data, which can
negatively affect the segmentation performance, are identified. Based on the
findings, a workflow was designed specifically for segmenting Bing data while

combine the use of both small unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) collected data and
the Bing data in a virtual simulation environment, data from these two sources
needed to be aligned and registered together. To this end, the authors also
proposed a data registration workflow that utilized the traditional iterative

collected 141,063 ads from the Facebook Ad Library API. Using machine learning
classifiers, each ad was automatically labeled by the primary marketing
category (housing, employment, credit, political, other). For each of the
categories, we analyzed the distribution of the ad content by age group and
gender. From the audit findings, we considered and present the limitations,

Therefore, we consider mixtures where experts require different amounts of

expert. By appropriate hyperparameter selection, our approach is able to bias
mixtures of experts towards selecting specific experts over others. In this
way, we show that the data transfer optimization between visual sensing and

relation between data availability and performance, we evaluate biased mixtures
on a range of mainstream computer vision problems, namely: (i) single shot
detection, (ii) image super resolution, and (iii) realtime video action

to meet different limits on allowed data utility, biased mixtures significantly
outperform previous work optimized to meet the same constraints on available

neighborhood-scale demographics by extending a novel statistical physics
approach called Density-Functional Fluctuation Theory (DFFT) to multi-component
time-dependent systems. In particular, this technique observes the fluctuations
in neighborhood-scale demographics to extract effective drivers of segregation.
As a demonstration, we simulate a segregated city using a Schelling-type
segregation model, and found that DFFT accurately predicts how a city-scale
demographic change trickles down to block scales. Should these results extend
to actual human populations, DFFT could capitalize on the recent advances in
demographic data collection and regional-scale forecasts to improve upon

unknown boundary in a computational domain. The problem takes the form of a
Bernoulli problem where only the Dirichlet datum is known on the boundary that
is to be identified, but additional information on the Neumann condition is
available on the known part of the boundary. The approach uses a classical
constrained optimization problem, where a cost functional is minimized with
respect to the unknown boundary, the position of which is defined implicitly by
a level set function. To solve the optimization problem a steepest descent
algorithm using shape derivatives is applied. In each iteration the cut finite
element method is used to obtain high accuracy approximations of the pde-model
constraint for a given level set configuration without re-meshing. We consider
three different shape derivatives. First the classical one, derived using the
continuous optimization problem (optimize then discretize). Then the functional
is first discretized using the CutFEM method and the shape derivative is
evaluated on the finite element functional (discretize then optimize). Finally
we consider a third approach, also using a discretized functional. In this case
we do not perturb the domain, but consider a so-called boundary value
correction method, where a small correction to the boundary position may be
included in the weak boundary condition. Using this correction the shape
derivative may be obtained by perturbing a distance parameter in the discrete
variational formulation. The theoretical discussion is illustrated with a
series of numerical examples showing that all three approaches produce similar
result on the proposed Bernoulli problem.

percent of parents have no access to them and they tend to search for the

that eye-tracking technology is one of the most promising tools for the early

common envelope evolution, using a combination of analytic and numerical
techniques. The early stages of evolution are driven by dynamical friction with
the envelope, which causes the outer triple orbit to shrink faster than the
inner binary. In most cases, this leads to a chaotic dynamical interaction
between the three stars, culminating in the ejection of one of the stars from
the triple. This ejection and resulting recoil on the remnant binary are
sufficient to eject all three stars from the envelope, which expands and
dissipates after the stars have escaped. These results have implications for
the properties of post-common envelope triples: they may only exist in cases
where the envelope was ejected before the onset of dynamical instability, the
likelihood of which depends on the initial binary separation and the envelope
structure. In cases where the triple becomes dynamically unstable, the triple
does not survive and the envelope dissipates without forming a planetary
nebula.

favoring accuracy. Typically, these approaches rely on a strong underlying

quality and algorithm health; b) re-initialize those algorithms that might be
malfunctioning; c) generate a smooth state estimate by multiplexing the inputs

  a study of liquid silica","6 pages, 4 figures",,,,"cond-mat.soft cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The fragility of a glassforming liquid characterizes how rapidly its
relaxation dynamics slow down with cooling. The viscosity of strong liquids
follows an Arrhenius law with a temperature-independent barrier height to
rearrangements responsible for relaxation, whereas fragile liquids experience a
much faster increase in their dynamics, suggesting a barrier height that
increases with decreasing temperature. Strong glassformers are typically
network glasses, while fragile glassformers are typically molecular or
hard-sphere-like. As a result of these differences at the microscopic level,
strong and fragile glassformers are usually treated separately from a
theoretical point of view. Silica is the archetypal strong glassformer at low
temperatures, but also exhibits a mysterious strong-to-fragile crossover at
higher temperatures. Here we show that softness, a structure-based machine
learned parameter that has previously been applied to fragile glassformers
provides a useful description of model liquid silica in the strong and fragile
regimes, and through the strong-to-fragile crossover. Just as for fragile
glassformers, the relationship between softness and dynamics is invariant and
Arrhenius in all regimes, but the average softness changes with temperature.
The strong-to-fragile crossover in silica is not due to a sudden, qualitative
change in structure, but can be explained by a simple Arrhenius form with a
continuously and linearly changing local structure. Our results unify the study
of liquid silica under a single simple conceptual picture.

structures from graphs. Despite the recent progress, the performance gap
between the state-of-the-art GPM systems and an efficient algorithm--pattern
decomposition--is still at least an order of magnitude. This paper clears the
fundamental obstacles of adopting pattern decomposition to a GPM system.
  First, the performance of pattern decomposition algorithms depends on how to
decompose the whole pattern into subpatterns. The original method performs
complexity analysis of algorithms for different choices, and selects the one
with the lowest complexity upper bound. Clearly, this approach is not feasible
for average or even expert users. To solve this problem, we develop a GPM
compiler with conventional and GPM-specific optimizations to generate
algorithms for different decomposition choices, which are evaluated based on an
accurate cost model. The executable of the GPM task is obtained from the
algorithm with the best performance. Second, we propose a novel
partial-embedding API that is sufficient to construct advanced GPM applications
while preserving pattern decomposition algorithm advantages. Compared to
state-of-the-art systems, our new GPM system, DwarvesGraph, developed based on
the ideas, reduces the execution time of GPM on large graphs and patterns from
days to a few hours with low programming effort.

parameter to the PS mechanism, and that the collapse occurs at either a given
cosmic time, or as fluctuations enter the horizon. We study the case where
fluctuations obey Gaussian statistics and follow a primordial power spectrum of
broken power-law form with a blue spectral index for small scales. We use the
observed abundance of super-massive black holes (SMBH) to constrain the
extended mass functions taking into account dynamical friction. We further
constrain the modified PS by developing a method for converting existing
constraints on the PBH mass fraction, derived assuming monochromatic mass
distributions for PBHs, into constraints applicable for extended PBH mass
functions. We find that when considering well established monochromatic
constraints there are regions in parameter space where all the dark matter can
be made of PBHs. Of special interest is the region for the characteristic mass
of the distribution ~10^2 M_Sun, for a wide range of blue spectral indices in
the scenario where PBHs form as they enter the horizon, where the linear
threshold for collapse is of the order of the typical overdensities, as this is
close to the black hole masses detected by LIGO which are difficult to explain
by stellar collapse.

exploration and denoising of electroencephalography (EEG) or
magnetoencephalography (MEG) signals. In its most common formulation, ICA
assumes that the signal matrix is a noiseless linear mixture of independent
sources that are assumed non-Gaussian. A limitation is that it enforces to
estimate as many sources as sensors or to rely on a detrimental PCA step.
  Methods: We present the Spectral Matching ICA (SMICA) model. Signals are
modelled as a linear mixing of independent sources corrupted by additive noise,
where sources and the noise are stationary Gaussian time series. Thanks to the
Gaussian assumption, the negative log-likelihood has a simple expression as a
sum of divergences between the empirical spectral covariance matrices of the
signals and those predicted by the model. The model parameters can then be
estimated by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
  Results: Experiments on phantom MEG datasets show that SMICA can recover
dipole locations more precisely than usual ICA algorithms or Maxwell filtering
when the dipole amplitude is low. Experiments on EEG datasets show that SMICA
identifies a source subspace which contains sources that have less pairwise
mutual information, and are better explained by the projection of a single
dipole on the scalp.
  Comparison with existing methods: Noiseless ICA models lead to degenerate
likelihood when there are fewer sources than sensors, while SMICA succeeds
without resorting to prior dimension reduction.
  Conclusions: SMICA is a promising alternative to other noiseless ICA models
based on non-Gaussian assumptions.

a number of devastating neuro-degenerative diseases. Many experimental studies
indicate that the ability of existing aggregates to replicate is a key property
in generating their pathogenic effect across a range of diseases. However,
given the complexity of the process in vivo, no principled general approach
currently exists to obtain the rates of the fundamental steps that underlie
aggregate formation from measurements in living systems. In order to address
this challenge, here we present a general approach for analysing aggregation
kinetics that considers broad classes of processes that can be described by a
family of scaling solutions. Our approach is not limited only to fibrillar
aggregates, but applies to any aggregate shape. We show that the rates can
reliably be extracted by fitting of a simple logistic function, even from
experimental data in living systems, and give a very general analytical
expression that relates the scaling of the exponential rate with monomer
concentration to the microscopic details of the underlying reaction. This
approach can thus be used to infer the microscopic mechanism driving the
aggregation process from macroscopic measurements in complex systems.

produced in both simulated atmospheres with small particle size (20 to 140 nm)

the particle size and production rate is dependent on the initial gas mixtures
and the energy sources used in the simulation experiments. The gas phase mass
spectra show that complex chemical processes happen in these atmospheres and
generate new gas products that can further react to form larger molecules and
solid haze particles. Two H2-rich atmospheres with similar C/O ratios (~0.5)
yield different haze particles size, haze production rate, and gas products,
suggesting both the elemental abundances and their bonding environments in an
atmosphere can significantly affect the photochemistry. There is no methane
(CH4) in our initial gas mixtures, although CH4 is often believed to be
required to generate organic hazes. However, haze production rates from our
experiments with different initial gas mixtures indicate that CH4 is neither
required to generate organic hazes nor necessary to promote the organic haze
formation. The variety and relative yield of the gas products indicate that CO

several novel vulnerabilities in all devices, causing the exposure of the

include the dominant frequency (or first harmonic), $\omega_0$, along with the
second, $2\omega_0$; third, $3\omega_0$; and higher harmonics. This behavior is
common for the propagation of weakly nonlinear waves with a narrow band of
frequencies centered around the dominant frequency such as in the evolution of
ocean swell, pulse propagation in optical fibers, and Langmuir waves in
plasmas. Presented herein are measurements of the amplitudes of the first and
second harmonic bands from four surface water wave laboratory experiments.
  The Stokes expansion for small-amplitude surface water waves provides
predictions for the amplitudes of the second and higher harmonics given the
amplitude of the first harmonic. Similarly, the derivations of the NLS equation
and its generalizations (models for the evolution of weakly nonlinear,
narrow-banded waves) provide predictions for the second and third harmonic
bands given measurements of the first harmonic band. We test the accuracy of
these predictions by making two types of comparisons with the experimental
measurements. First, we consider the evolution of the second harmonic band
while neglecting all other harmonic bands. Second, we use explicit Stokes and
generalized NLS formulas to predict the evolution of the second harmonic band
using the first harmonic data as input. Comparisons of both types show
reasonable agreement, though predictions obtained from dissipative
generalizations of NLS consistently outperform the conservative ones. Finally,
we show that the predictions obtained from these two methods are qualitatively
different.

systems exhibiting uniform hyperbolic behavior. Therefore their properties are
intensively studied, including which spaces allow such a diffeomorphism. It is
conjectured that any closed manifold admitting an Anosov diffeomorphism is
homeomorphic to an infra-nilmanifold, i.e. a compact quotient of a 1-connected
nilpotent Lie group by a discrete group of isometries. This conjecture
motivates the problem of describing which infra-nilmanifolds admit an Anosov
diffeomorphism.
  So far, most research was focused on the restricted class of nilmanifolds,
which are quotients of 1-connected nilpotent Lie groups by uniform lattices.
For example, Dani and Mainkar studied this question for the nilmanifolds
associated to graphs, which form the natural generalization of nilmanifolds
modeled on free nilpotent Lie groups. This paper further generalizes their work
to the full class of infra-nilmanifolds associated to graphs, leading to a
necessary and sufficient condition depending only on the induced action of the

the ratio of nuclear to atomic size -- that nuclear properties actually
contribute to electronic energies through fewer parameters than the number of
these effective nuclear couplings naively suggests. Our result is derived using
a position-space method for matching effective parameters to nuclear properties
in the EFT, that more efficiently exploits the simplicity of the small-nucleus
limit in atomic systems. By showing that precision calculations of atomic
spectra depend on fewer nuclear uncertainties than naively expected, this
observation allows the construction of many nucleus-independent combinations of
atomic energy differences whose measurement can be used to test fundamental
physics (such as the predictions of QED) because their theoretical
uncertainties are not limited by the accuracy of nuclear calculations. We
provide several simple examples of such nucleus-free predictions for

prevents using precision atomic measurements to test fundamental theory. We
apply newly developed effective field theory tools to Hydrogen atoms, and use
them to show that (to the accuracy of present measurements) all nuclear
finite-size effects (e.g. the charge radius, Friar moments, nuclear
polarizabilities, recoil corrections, Zemach moments {\it etc.}) only enter
into atomic energies through exactly two parameters, independent of any
nuclear-modelling uncertainties. Since precise measurements are available for
more than two atomic levels in Hydrogen, this observation allows the use of
precision atomic measurements to eliminate the theory error associated with
nuclear matrix elements. We apply this reasoning to the seven atomic
measurements whose experimental accuracy is smaller than 10 kHz to provide
predictions for nuclear-size effects whose theoretical accuracy is not subject
to nuclear-modelling uncertainties and so are much smaller than 1 kHz.
Furthermore, the accuracy of these predictions can improve as atomic
measurements improve, allowing precision fundamental tests to become possible
well below the 'irreducible' error floor of nuclear theory.

build the IoT blockchain, where IoT devices could purchase computational
resources from the edge servers. In this paper, we consider the case that IoT
devices also have other tasks that need the help of edge servers, such as data
analysis and data storage. The profits they can get from these tasks is closely
related to the amounts of resources they purchased from the edge servers. In
this scenario, IoT devices will allocate their limited budgets to purchase
different resources from different edge servers, such that their profits can be
maximized. Moreover, edge servers will set ""best"" prices such that they can get
the biggest benefits. Accordingly, there raise a pricing and budget allocation

bond-based peridynamic models. There has been in recent years a renewed
interest in the class of so-called non-local models, which include peridynamic
models, for the simulation of structural mechanics problems as an alternative
approach to classical local continuum models. However, a major issue, which is
often disregarded when dealing with this class of models, is concerned with the
manner by which boundary conditions should be prescribed. Our point of view
here is that classical boundary conditions, since applied on surfaces of solid
bodies, are naturally associated with local models. The paper describes two
methods to incorporate classical Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions into
bond-based peridynamics. The first method consists in artificially extending
the domain with a thin boundary layer over which the displacement field is
required to behave as an odd function with respect to the boundary points. The
second method resorts to the idea that peridynamic models and local models
should be compatible in the limit that the so-called horizon vanishes. The
approach consists then in decreasing the horizon from a constant value in the
interior of the domain to zero at the boundary so that one can directly apply
the classical boundary conditions. We present the continuous and discrete
formulations of the two methods and assess their performance on several
numerical experiments dealing with the simulation of a one-dimensional bar.

to study time-dependent fluorescence spectra of a driven qubit in the weak- to

spontaneous decay rate are comparable to the transition frequency of the qubit.
Our method agrees well with the time-local master-equation approach in the
weak-coupling regime, and offers a flexible way to compute the spectra from the
bosonic dynamics instead of two-time correlation functions. While the
perturbative master equation breaks down in the strong-coupling regime, our
method actually becomes more accurate due to the use of bosonic coherent states
under certain conditions. We show that the counter-rotating coupling between
the qubit and the reservoir has considerable contributions to the photon number
dynamics and the spectra under strong driving conditions even though the
coupling is moderately weak. The time-dependent spectra are found to be
generally asymmetric, a feature that is derived from photon number dynamics. In
addition, it is shown that the spectral profiles can be dramatically different
from the Mollow triplet due to strong dissipation and/or multiphoton processes
associated with the strong driving. Our formalism provides a unique perspective
to interpret time-dependent spectra.

outbreaks of infectious disease. More precisely, one can use the search volume
of some search terms to predict the infection rate of an infectious disease in
nearly real-time. However, conducting accurate and stable prediction of
outbreaks using search engine logs is a challenging task due to the following
two-way instability characteristics of the search logs. First, the search
volume of a search term may change irregularly in the short-term, for example,
due to environmental factors such as the amount of media or news. Second, the
search volume may also change in the long-term due to the demographic change of
the search engine. That is to say, if a model is trained with such search logs
with ignoring such characteristic, the resulting prediction would contain
serious mispredictions when these changes occur.
  In this work, we proposed a novel feature selection method to overcome this
instability problem. In particular, we employ a seasonal-adjustment method that
decomposes each time series into three components: seasonal, trend and
irregular component and build prediction models for each component
individually. We also carefully design a feature selection method to select
proper search terms to predict each component. We conducted comprehensive
experiments on ten different kinds of infectious diseases. The experimental
results show that the proposed method outperforms all comparative methods in
prediction accuracy for seven of ten diseases, in both now-casting and

three-body interactions expressed in terms of conventional spin-half operators.
Of the model's two free parameters, one controls the preference for Ising
antiferromagnetism and the other controls the strength of quantum fluctuations.
In this formulation, the so-called $t$-deformed model (an exactly solvable,
frustration-free Hamiltonian) lives on a unit circle centered on the origin of
the phase diagram. The circle demarcates the boundary between ferromagnetic
order inside and various antiferromagnetic phases outside. Throughout most of
the non-ferromagnetic parts of the phase diagram, the ground state has Dyck
word form: i.e., all contributing spin configurations exhibit perfect matching
and nesting of spin up and spin down. The exceptions are two regions in which
Dyck word mismatches are energetically favorable. We remark that in those
regions the energy level spacing can be exponentially small in the system size.
It is also the case that exact diagonalization reveals a highly idiosyncratic
energy spectrum, presumably because the hard spin twist at the chain ends
induces strong incommensurability effects on the bulk system when the chain
length is small. As a convergence check, we benchmark our DMRG results to
near-double-precision floating-point accuracy against analytical results at
exactly solvable points and against exact diagonalization results for small
system sizes across the entire parameter space.

both designed in a 65-nm CMOS technology for the ATLAS Inner Tracker Pixel
Detector readout upgrade.
  The first prototype, GBCR1, has four upstream receiver channels and one
downstream transmitter channel with pre-emphasis. Each upstream channel
receives the data at 5.12 Gbps through a 5 meter AWG34 Twinax cable from an
ASIC driver located on the pixel module and restores the signal from the high
frequency loss due to the low mass cable. The signal is retimed by a recovered
clock before it is sent to the optical transmitter VTRx+. The downstream driver
is designed to transmit the 2.56 Gbps signal from lpGBT to the electronics on
the pixel module over the same cable. The peak-peak jitter (throughout the
paper jitter is always peak-peak unless specified) of the restored signal is
35.4 ps at the output of GBCR1, and 138 ps for the downstream channel at the
cable ends. GBCR1 consumes 318 mW and is tested.
  The second prototype, GBCR2, has seven upstream channels and two downstream
channels. Each upstream channel works at 1.28 Gbps to recover the data directly
from the RD53B ASIC through a 1 meter custom FLEX cable followed by a 6 meter
AWG34 Twinax cable. The equalized signal of each upstream channel is retimed by
an input 1.28 GHz phase programmable clock. Compared with the signal at the
FLEX input, the additional jitter of the equalized signal is about 80 ps when
the retiming logic is o . When the retiming logic is on, the jitter is 50 ps at
GBCR2 output, assuming the 1.28 GHz retiming clock is from lpGBT. The
downstream is designed to transmit the 160 Mbps signal from lpGBT through the
same cable connection to RD53B and the jitter is about 157 ps at the cable
ends. GBCR2 consumes about 150 mW when the retiming logic is on. This design
was submitted in November 2019.

hyperspectral images (HSIs) denoising. Among them, unsupervised methods such as
the deep image prior (DIP) have received much attention because these methods
do not require any training data. However, DIP suffers from the
semi-convergence behavior, i.e., the iteration of DIP needs to terminate by
referring to the ground-truth image at the optimal iteration point. In this
paper, we propose the spatial-spectral constrained deep image prior (S2DIP) for
HSI mixed noise removal. Specifically, we incorporate DIP with a
spatial-spectral total variation (SSTV) term to fully preserve the
spatial-spectral local smoothness of the HSI and an $\ell_1$-norm term to
capture the complex sparse noise. The proposed S2DIP jointly leverages the
expressive power brought from the deep CNN without any training data and
exploits the HSI and noise structures via hand-crafted priors. Thus, our method
avoids the semi-convergence behavior, showing higher stabilities than DIP.
Meanwhile, our method largely enhances the HSI denoising ability of DIP. To
tackle the proposed denoising model, we develop an alternating direction
multiplier method algorithm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed S2DIP outperforms optimization-based and supervised CNN-based
state-of-the-art HSI denoising methods.

  Computer Simulation Study",,,"10.1088/1361-6560/abc5ca",,"physics.med-ph","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Standard dual-energy computed tomography (CT) uses two different X-ray
energies to obtain energy-dependent tissue attenuation information to allow
quantitative material decomposition. The combined use of dual-energy CT and
positron emission tomography (PET) may provide a more comprehensive
characterization of disease states in cancer and many other diseases. However,
the integration of dual-energy CT with PET is not trivial, either requiring
costly hardware upgrade or increasing radiation dose. This paper proposes a
novel dual-energy CT imaging method that is enabled by the already-available
PET data on PET/CT. Instead of using a second X-ray CT scan with a different
energy, this method exploits time-of-flight PET image reconstruction via the
maximum likelihood attenuation and activity (MLAA) algorithm to obtain a 511
keV gamma-ray attenuation image from PET emission data. The high-energy
gamma-ray CT image is then combined with the low-energy X-ray CT of PET/CT to
provide a pair of dual-energy CT images. A major challenge with the standard
MLAA reconstruction is the high noise present in the reconstructed 511 keV
attenuation map, which does not compromise the PET activity reconstruction too

considered via both experimental measurements and linear stability theory.
Velocity snapshots of screeching jets are used to produce a reduced order model
of the screech cycle via proper orthogonal decomposition. Streamwise Fourier
filtering is then applied to isolate the negative and positive wavenumber
components, which for the waves of interest in this jet correspond to upstream
and downstream-travelling waves. A global stability analysis on an
experimentally derived base flow is conducted, demonstrating a close match to
the results obtained via experiment, indicating that the mechanisms considered
here are well represented in a linear framework. In both analyses, three
distinct wavelike structures are evident. These three waves are those first
shown by Tam & Hu (1989) to be supported by a cylindrical vortex sheet. One is
the Kelvin-Helmholtz mode. Another is the upstream-travelling guided jet mode
that has been a topic of recent discussion. The third component, with positive
phase velocity, has not previously been identified in screeching jets. We
provide evidence that this downstream-travelling wave is a duct-like mode
similar to that recently identified in high-subsonic jets by Towne et al.
(2017). We further demonstrate that both of the latter two waves are generated
by the interaction between the Kelvin-Helmholtz wavepacket and the shock cells
in the flow, according to a theory first proposed in Tam & Tanna (1982).
Finally, we consider the periodic spatial modulation of the coherent velocity
fluctuation evident in screeching jets, and show that this modulation is the
result of the superposition of the three wavelike structures, with no evidence
that the shocks in the flow modulate the growth of the Kelvin-Helmholtz
wavepacket.

the bond orientational order parameter. As the packing pressure, $p$, varies
from the marginally rigid limit at the jamming transition ($p \approx 0$) to
that of more robust systems ($p \gg 0$), the coordination number, $z$, follows
a familiar scaling relation with pressure, namely, $\Delta z = z - z_c \sim
p^{1/2}$, where $z_c = 2d = 6$ ($d=3$ is the spatial dimension). While it has
previously been noted that $\Delta z$ does indeed remain the control parameter
for determining the packing properties, here we show how the packing structure
plays an influential role on the mechanical properties of the packings.
Specifically, we find that the elastic (bulk $K$ and shear $G$) moduli,
generically referred to as $M$, become functions of both $\Delta z$ and the
structure, to the extent that $M-M_c \sim \Delta z$. Here, $M_c$ are values of
the elastic moduli at the jamming transition, which depend on the structure of
the packings. In particular, the zero shear modulus, $G_c=0$, is a special
feature of fully amorphous packings, whereas more ordered packings take larger,
positive values, $G_c > 0$.

The elemental abundance of neon is much higher than that of the argon. However,

engineering is still lacking. Here, we extend the 'twistnonics' to 2D puckered
materials with a 'phonon magic angle' discovered by molecular dynamics
simulation. The phonon magic angle, with the TP-1 and TP-2 direction
overlapped, remains a high level or even enhances phonon transport capability
due to van der Waals confinement. This novel phenomenon originates from the
confined vdW interaction and ordered atomic vibration caused by the perfect
lattice arrangement that the atoms of the top layer can be stuck to the spaces
of the bottom layer. Moreover, it is found that both the in-plane and
out-of-plane thermal transport properties can be effectively regulated by
applying the twist. Through the phononic and electronic analysis, the
deterioration of phonon transport capability for other twist angles are
attributed to the suppression of acoustic phonon modes, reduction of phonon
lifetimes and mismatched lattice vibration between layers. Our findings shed
light on the twistnonics of low-dimensional asymmetrical materials and can be
further extended to electronic and photonic devices.

retinopathy (DR). This disease occurs when high blood glucose levels cause
damage to blood vessels in the retina. Computer-aided DR diagnosis is a
promising tool for early detection of DR and severity grading, due to the great
success of deep learning. However, most current DR diagnosis systems do not
achieve satisfactory performance or interpretability for ophthalmologists, due
to the lack of training data with consistent and fine-grained annotations. To
address this problem, we construct a large fine-grained annotated DR dataset
containing 2,842 images (FGADR). This dataset has 1,842 images with pixel-level
DR-related lesion annotations, and 1,000 images with image-level labels graded
by six board-certified ophthalmologists with intra-rater consistency. The
proposed dataset will enable extensive studies on DR diagnosis. We set up three
benchmark tasks for evaluation: 1. DR lesion segmentation; 2. DR grading by
joint classification and segmentation; 3. Transfer learning for ocular
multi-disease identification. Moreover, a novel inductive transfer learning
method is introduced for the third task. Extensive experiments using different
state-of-the-art methods are conducted on our FGADR dataset, which can serve as
baselines for future research.

years, the most common and efficient way to detect sleep issues remains a sleep
examination performed in a sleep laboratory, in a procedure called
Polysomnography (PSG). This examination measures several vital signals during a
full night's sleep using multiple sensors connected to the patient's body. Yet,
despite being the golden standard, the connection of the sensors and the
unfamiliar environment inevitably impact the quality of the patient's sleep and
the examination itself. Therefore, with the novel development of more accurate
and affordable 3D sensing devices, new approaches for non-contact sleep study
emerged. These methods utilize different techniques with the purpose to extract
the same sleep parameters, but remotely, eliminating the need of any physical
connections to the patient's body. However, in order to enable reliable remote
extraction, these methods require accurate identification of the basic Region
of Interest (ROI) i.e. the chest area of the patient, a task that is currently
holding back the development process, as it is performed manually for each
patient. In this study, we propose an automatic chest area segmentation
algorithm, that given an input set of 3D frames of a sleeping patient, outputs
a segmentation image with the pixels that correspond to the chest area, and can
then be used as an input to subsequent sleep analysis algorithms. Except for
significantly speeding up the development process of the non-contact methods,
accurate automatic segmentation can also enable a more precise feature
extraction and it is shown it is already improving sensitivity of prior
solutions on average 46.9% better compared to manual ROI selection. All
mentioned will place the extraction algorithms of the non-contact methods as a
leading candidate to replace the existing traditional methods used today.

thermodynamics can be proposed. To investigate this issue, a physical process
that the black hole in Horndeski gravity is perturbed by the accreting matter
fields and finally settles down to a stationary state is considered. According
to the two assumptions that there is a regular bifurcation surface in the
background spacetime and that the matter fields always satisfy the null energy
condition, one can show that the Wald entropy monotonically increases along the
future event horizon under the linear order approximation without any specific
expression of the metric. It illustrates that the Wald entropy of black holes
in Horndeski gravitational theory still obeys the requirement of the linearized

Horndeski gravity and takes a step towards studying the area increase theorem
in the gravitational theories with non-minimal coupled matter fields.

effectiveness for modeling tabular data, but is not globally interpretable. In
this work, we find local piece-wise interpretations in DNN of a specific
feature are usually inconsistent in different samples, which is caused by
feature interactions in the hidden layers. Accordingly, we can design an
automatic feature crossing method to find feature interactions in DNN, and use
them as cross features in LR. We give definition of the interpretation
inconsistency in DNN, based on which a novel feature crossing method called
DNN2LR is proposed. Extensive experiments have been conducted on four public

benchmarks have alleviated this problem substantially, making it possible to
properly evaluate NAS methods in seconds on commodity machines. However, an
unintended consequence of tabular NAS benchmarks has been a focus on extremely
small architectural search spaces since their construction relies on exhaustive
evaluations of the space. This leads to unrealistic results that do not
transfer to larger spaces. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we propose
a methodology to create cheap NAS surrogate benchmarks for arbitrary search
spaces. We exemplify this approach by creating surrogate NAS benchmarks on the
existing tabular NAS-Bench-101 and on two widely used NAS search spaces with up
to $10^{21}$ architectures ($10^{13}$ times larger than any previous tabular
NAS benchmark). We show that surrogate NAS benchmarks can model the true

different NAS methods work on the original non-surrogate benchmark, and that
they can generate new scientific insight. We open-source all our code and
believe that surrogate NAS benchmarks are an indispensable tool to extend
scientifically sound work on NAS to large and exciting search spaces.

challenging problem. Here, to shed light on these localisation phenomena, we
studied the dc transport and optical conductivity properties of nanoscaled
multilayered films composed of disordered metallic Ta and magnetic FeNi
nanoisland layers, where ferromagnetic FeNi nanoislands have giant magnetic
moments of 10^3-10^5 Bohr magnetons (\mu_B). In these multilayered structures,
FeNi nanoisland giant magnetic moments are interacting due to the indirect
exchange forces acting via the Ta electron subsystem. We discovered that the
localisation phenomena in the disordered Ta layer lead to a decrease in the
Drude contribution of free charge carriers and the appearance of the low-energy
electronic excitations in the 1-2 eV spectral range characteristic of
electronic correlations, which may accompany the formation of electronic
inhomogeneities. From the consistent results of the dc transport and optical
studies we found that with an increase in the FeNi layer thickness across the
percolation threshold evolution from the superferromagnetic to ferromagnetic
behaviour within the FeNi layer leads to the delocalisation of Ta electrons
from the associated localised electronic states. On the contrary, we discovered
that when the FeNi layer is discontinuous and represented by randomly
distributed superparamagnetic FeNi nanoislands, the Ta layer normalized dc
conductivity falls down below the MIR limit by about 60%. The discovered effect
leading to the dc conductivity fall below the MIR limit can be associated with
non-ergodicity and purely quantum (many-body) localisation phenomena, which
need to be challenged further.

for very young stellar populations. Here we present new HST/COS ultraviolet
spectroscopy of seven nearby ($<120$ Mpc) star-forming regions hosting very
young stellar populations ($\sim$ 4-20 Myr) with optical Wolf-Rayet stellar
wind signatures, ideal laboratories in which to test these stellar models. We
detect nebular C III] in all seven, but at equivalent widths uniformly $< 10$
{\AA}. This suggests that even for very young stellar populations, the highest
equivalent width C III] emission at $\geq 15$ {\AA} is reserved for
inefficiently-cooled gas at metallicities at or below that of the SMC. The
spectra also reveal strong C IV P-Cygni profiles and broad He II emission
formed in the winds of massive stars, including some of the most prominent He
II stellar wind lines ever detected in integrated spectra. We find that the
latest stellar population synthesis prescriptions with improved treatment of
massive stars nearly reproduce the entire range of stellar He II wind strengths
observed here. However, we find that these models cannot simultaneously match
the strongest wind features alongside the optical nebular line constraints.
This discrepancy can be naturally explained by an overabundance of very massive
stars produced by a high incidence of binary mass transfer and mergers
occurring on short $\lesssim 10$ Myr timescales, suggesting these processes may
be crucial for understanding the highest-sSFR galaxies in the early Universe.
Reproducing both the stellar and nebular light of young systems such as these
will be a crucial benchmark for the next generation of stellar population
synthesis models.

stopping conditions are satisfied. This technique allows us to give a unified
analysis and converge rates in the general smooth non convex setting, as well
as convergence rates under a Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property, a setting that,
to our knowledge, has not been analyzed before for the projection-free methods
under study. In this context, we prove local convergence rates comparable to
those of projected gradient methods under the same conditions. Our analysis
relies on a sufficient slope condition, ensuring that the directions selected
by the methods have the steepest slope possible up to a constant among feasible
directions. This condition is satisfied, among others, by several Frank-Wolfe
(FW) variants on polytopes, and by some projection-free methods on convex sets
with smooth boundary.

Remeslennikov on the edge of algebra, logic and geometry. We start from a brief
review of the paper and motivations. The first sections deal with model theory.
In Section 2.1 we describe the geometric equivalence, the elementary
equivalence, and the isotypicity of algebras. We look at these notions from the
positions of universal algebraic geometry and make emphasis on the cases of the
first order rigidity. In this setting Plotkin's problem on the structure of
automorphisms of (auto)endomorphisms of free objects, and auto-equivalence of
categories is pretty natural and important. Section 2.2 is dedicated to
particular cases of Plotkin's problem. Section 2.3 is devoted to Plotkin's
problem for automorphisms of the group of polynomial symplectomorphisms. This
setting has applications to mathematical physics through the use of model
theory (non-standard analysis) in the studying of homomorphisms between groups
of symplectomorphisms and automorphisms of the Weyl algebra. The last two
sections deal with algorithmic problems for noncommutative and commutative
algebraic geometry. Section 3.1 is devoted to the Gr\""obner basis in
non-commutative situation. Despite the existence of an algorithm for checking
equalities, the zero divisors and nilpotency problems are algorithmically
unsolvable. Section 3.2 is connected with the problem of embedding of algebraic

an additional gender prediction objective in the main model. This auxiliary

apply our Fill-in the Identity model to establish links between the predicted

with both temporal and spatial dependence due to link failures, packet dropouts

convergence rate of distributed linear equation protocols over a $\ast$-mixing
random network, where the temporal and spatial dependencies between the

admits exact solutions, we prove the mean-squared exponential convergence rate
of the distributed projection consensus algorithm, while the lower and upper

identically distributed (i.i.d.) random graphs. Motivated by the randomized
Kaczmarz algorithm, we also propose a distributed randomized projection
consensus algorithm, where each node randomly selects one row of local linear
equations for projection per iteration, and establish an exponential
convergence rate. When the network linear equation admits no exact solution, we
prove that a distributed gradient-descent-like algorithm with diminishing

Baker omitted value, in short \textit{bov} if there is a disk $D$ centered at
the bov such that each component of the boundary of $f^{-1}(D)$ is bounded.
Assuming that the bov is in the Fatou set of $f$, this article investigates the
dynamics of the function. Firstly, the connectivity of all the Fatou components
are determined. If $U$ is the Fatou component containing the bov then it is
proved that a Fatou component $U'$ is infinitely connected if and only if it
lands on $U$, i.e. $f^{k}(U') \subset U$ for some $k \geq 1$. Every other Fatou
component is either simply connected or lands on a Herman ring. Further,
assuming that the number of critical points in the Fatou set whose forward
orbits do not intersect $U$ is finite, we have shown that the connectivity of
each Fatou component belongs to a finite set. This set is independent of the
Fatou components. It is proved that the Fatou component containing the bov is
completely invariant whenever it is forward invariant. Further, if the
invariant Fatou component is an attracting domain and compactly contains all
the critical values of the function then the Julia set is totally disconnected.
Baker domains are shown to be non-existent whenever the bov is in the Fatou
set. It is also proved that, if there is a $2$-periodic Baker domain (these are
not ruled out when the bov is in the Julia set), or a $2$-periodic attracting
or parabolic domain containing the bov then the function has no Herman ring.
Some examples exhibiting different possibilities for the Fatou set are
discussed. This includes the first example of a meromorphic function with an
omitted value which has two infinitely connected Fatou components.

Interferometric Optical Telescope Array (IOTA) to provide imagery of the LPV

given the low continuum opacity, which allows for emission to be observed over
a very long path in the stellar atmosphere and envelope. The observed
visibilities are consistent with a simple core-halo model to represent the
central object and the extended molecular layers but, in addition, they
demonstrate a substantial asymmetry. An analysis with image reconstruction
software shows that the asymmetry is consistent with a localized absorbing
patch. The observed opacity is tentatively associated with small dust grains,
which will grow substantially during a multi-year ejection process. Spatial
information along with a deduced dust content of the cloud, known mass loss
rates, and ejection velocities provide evidence for the pulsational pumping of
the extended molecular layers. The cloud may be understood as a spatially local
zone of enhanced dust formation, very near to the pulsating halo. The observed
mass loss could be provided by several such active regions around the star.
This result provides an additional clue for better understanding the clumpiness
of dust production in the atmosphere of AGB stars. It is compatible with
scenarios where the combination of pulsation and convection play a key role in
the process of mass loss.

Pakistan, could remain in the worst affected region by the COVID-19. In order
to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is important to predict the trend of

Fundamentally, the idea is to dependably estimate the reproduction number to
judge the spread rate of COVID-19 in a particular region. Consequently, this
paper uses publicly available epidemiological data of Bangladesh, India, and
Pakistan to estimate the reproduction numbers. More specifically, we use
various models (for example, susceptible infection recovery (SIR), exponential

dependent (TD)) to estimate the reproduction numbers and observe the model
fitness in the corresponding data set. Experimental results show that the
reproduction numbers produced by these models are greater than 1.2

stellar masses 2) an {\it ex situ} dependence of the HI mass on the halo
mass/environment. We find that if we solely use galaxy associated scaling

Function (SMF). The model involves both turbulent fragmentation and competitive
accretion. Turbulent fragmentation creates low-mass seed proto-systems (i.e.
single and multiple protostars). Some of these low-mass seed proto-systems then
grow by competitive accretion to produce the high-mass power-law tail of the
SMF. Turbulent fragmentation is relatively inefficient, in the sense that the
creation of low-mass seed proto-systems only consumes a fraction, $\sim 23\%$
(at most $\sim 50\%$), of the mass available for star formation. The remaining
mass is consumed by competitive accretion. Provided the accretion rate onto a
proto-system is approximately proportional to its mass ($dm/dt \propto m$), the
SMF develops a power-law tail at high masses with the Salpeter slope ($\sim
-2.3$). If the rate of supply of mass accelerates, the rate of proto-system
formation also accelerates, as appears to be observed in many clusters.
However, even if the rate of supply of mass decreases, or ceases and then
resumes, the SMF evolves homologously, retaining the same overall shape, and
the high-mass power-law tail simply extends to ever higher masses until the
supply of gas runs out completely. The Chabrier SMF can be reproduced very
accurately if the seed proto-systems have an approximately log-normal mass
distribution with median mass $\sim 0.11 {\rm M}_{_\odot}$ and logarithmic
standard deviation $\sigma_{\log_{10}(M/{\rm M}_\odot)}\sim 0.47$).

general, we consider two applied scenarios, \ie, deep classification and deep
metric learning. Under the long-tailed data distribution, the majority classes
(\ie, tail classes) only occupy relatively few samples and are prone to lack of
within-class diversity. A radical solution is to augment the tail classes with
higher diversity. To this end, we introduce a simple and reliable method named
Memory-based Jitter (MBJ). We observe that during training, the deep model
constantly changes its parameters after every iteration, yielding the
phenomenon of \emph{weight jitters}. Consequentially, given a same image as the
input, two historical editions of the model generate two different features in
the deeply-embedded space, resulting in \emph{feature jitters}. Using a memory
bank, we collect these (model or feature) jitters across multiple training
iterations and get the so-called Memory-based Jitter. The accumulated jitters
enhance the within-class diversity for the tail classes and consequentially
improves long-tailed visual recognition. With slight modifications, MBJ is
applicable for two fundamental visual recognition tasks, \emph{i.e.}, deep
image classification and deep metric learning (on long-tailed data). Extensive
experiments on five long-tailed classification benchmarks and two deep metric
learning benchmarks demonstrate significant improvement. Moreover, the achieved
performance are on par with the state of the art on both tasks.

issue due to the chirality-dependence of many chemical, biological, and

five-level double-$\Delta$ model of chiral molecules. By utilizing the breaking
of left-right symmetry in the two $\Delta$-type sub-structures, we can
establish the chiral-state-selective excitation with one chiral ground state
being excited to an achiral excited state and the other one being undisturbed.
In the meanwhile, the achiral excited state will relax to the two chiral ground
states. The two effects simultaneously acting on the chiral mixtures can
convert molecules of different chiralities to the ones of the same chirality,
i.e., the enantio-conversion via optical pumping. With typical parameters in
gas-phase experiments, we numerically show that highly efficient
enantio-conversion can be achieved. Our method works in the appearance of
decoherences and without the precise control of pulse-durations (pulse-areas)
and/or pulse-shapes. These advantages offer it promising features in promoting
the future exploring of enantio-conversion.

that the appraisal states can be reduced to a lower dimension due to the

unpredictability then become mere statements of undifferentiation of structure.
This gives us a notion of realism that is better informed by modern physics,

its need to be fed by an enriched dataset to increase its accuracy and avoid it

augment the training data with new synthesized adversarial samples. Recently,
researchers have worked extensively to propose methods for data augmentation.
In this paper, we generate adversarial samples to refine the Domains of

model learned by the primary and generated adversarial data (up to that stage)
to manipulate the primary data in a way that look complicated to the DNN. The
DNN is then retrained using the augmented data and then it again generates
adversarial data that are hard to predict for itself. As the DNN tries to
improve its accuracy by competing with itself (generating hard samples and then
learning them), the technique is called Self-Competitive Neural Network (SCNN).
To generate such samples, we pose the problem as an optimization task, where
the network weights are fixed and use a gradient descent based method to
synthesize adversarial samples that are on the boundary of their true labels
and the nearest wrong labels. Our experimental results show that data
augmentation using SCNNs can significantly increase the accuracy of the
original network. As an example, we can mention improving the accuracy of a CNN

radiative transfer we produce synthetic ALMA observations of these discs. In
doing so we demonstrate that our model is capable of producing observational
predictions, and able to model real image data of potentially self-gravitating
discs. For a disc to generate spiral structure that would be observable with
ALMA requires that the disc's dust mass budget is dominated by millimetre and
centimetre-sized grains. Discs in which grains have grown to the grain
fragmentation threshold may satisfy this criterion, thus we predict that
signatures of gravitational instability may be detectable in discs of lower
mass than has previously been suggested. For example, we find that discs with
disc-to-star mass ratios as low as $0.10$ are capable of driving observable
spiral arms. Substructure becomes challenging to detect in discs where no grain
growth has occurred or in which grain growth has proceeded well beyond the
grain fragmentation threshold. We demonstrate how we can use our model to
retrieve information about dust trapping and grain growth through
multi-wavelength observations of discs, and using estimates of the opacity
spectral index. Applying our disc model to the Elias 27, WaOph 6 and IM Lup

pipeline: depicting action instances by pre-defined anchors, learning to select
the anchors closest to the ground truth, and predicting the confidence of
anchors with refinements. Pre-defined anchors set prior about the location and
duration for action instances, which facilitates the localization for common
action instances but limits the flexibility for tackling action instances with
drastic varieties, especially for extremely short or extremely long ones. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a novel anchor-free action
localization module that assists action localization by temporal points.
Specifically, this module represents an action instance as a point with its
distances to the starting boundary and ending boundary, alleviating the
pre-defined anchor restrictions in terms of action localization and duration.
The proposed anchor-free module is capable of predicting the action instances
whose duration is either extremely short or extremely long. By combining the
proposed anchor-free module with a conventional anchor-based module, we propose
a novel action localization framework, called A2Net. The cooperation between
anchor-free and anchor-based modules achieves superior performance to the
state-of-the-art on THUMOS14 (45.5% vs. 42.8%). Furthermore, comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the complementarity between the anchor-free and the
anchor-based module, making A2Net simple but effective.

phenomena of the avoided crossing with the first pressure ($p_1$-) mode. We
find that the $f$-mode frequency and the average density for the neutron star
at the avoided crossing can be expressed as a function of the parameter,
$\eta$, which is the specific combination of the nuclear saturation parameters.
Owing to these relations, we can derive the empirical formula expressing the
$f$-mode frequency for a low-mass neutron star, whose central density is larger
than that for the neutron star at the avoided crossing, as a function of $\eta$
and the square root of the stellar average density, $x$. On the other hand, we
also derive the empirical formula expressing the $f$-mode frequency for a
neutron star, whose central density is less than that for the neutron star at
the avoided crossing, as a function of $x$ independently of the adopted EOS.
Furthermore, adopting the empirical formula of $x$ as a function of $\eta$ and
$u_c$, which is the ratio of the stellar central density to the saturation
density, we can also rewrite our empirical formula for the $f$-mode frequency
to a function of $\eta$ and $u_c$. So, by observing the $f$-mode gravitational
wave from a low-mass neutron star, whose mass or gravitational redshift is
known, one could evaluate the values of $\eta$ and $u_c$, which enables us to
severely constrain the EOS for neutron star matter.

privacy of the sensitive training data. The key to obtain differentially
private models is to introduce noise/randomness to the training process. In
particular, existing differentially private machine learning methods add noise
to the training data, the gradients, the loss function, and/or the model
itself. Bagging, a popular ensemble learning framework, randomly creates some
subsamples of the training data, trains a base model for each subsample using a
base learner, and takes majority vote among the base models when making
predictions. Bagging has intrinsic randomness in the training process as it
randomly creates subsamples. Our major theoretical results show that such
intrinsic randomness already makes Bagging differentially private without the
needs of additional noise. In particular, we prove that, for any base learner,
Bagging with and without replacement respectively achieves $\left(N\cdot k
\cdot \ln{\frac{n+1}{n}},1- (\frac{n-1}{n})^{N\cdot k}\right)$-differential
privacy and $\left(\ln{\frac{n+1}{n+1-N\cdot k}}, \frac{N\cdot k}{n}
\right)$-differential privacy, where $n$ is the training data size, $k$ is the
subsample size, and $N$ is the number of base models. Moreover, we prove that
if no assumptions about the base learner are made, our derived privacy
guarantees are tight. We empirically evaluate Bagging on MNIST and CIFAR10. Our
experimental results demonstrate that Bagging achieves significantly higher
accuracies than state-of-the-art differentially private machine learning

shows that the black hole and neutron star (BH-NS) or BH-BH systems with a BH
mass of tens of solar masses widely exist in the universe. Two main types of
scenarios have been invoked for the formation of BH-NS/BH systems, including
isolated binary evolution in galactic fields and dynamical interactions in
dense environments. Here we propose that if the BH-NS/BH systems are formed
from isolated binary evolution, the supernova (SN) signal associated with the
second core collapse would show some identifiable features, due to the
accretion feedback from the companion BH. Depending on the binary properties,
we show that the SN lightcurve could present a sharp peak around $\sim10$ days,
with luminosity even at the level of the super luminous SNe ( e.g.
$\sim10^{44}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$) or present a plateau feature lasting for several
tens of days with regular luminosity of core collapse SNe. Comparing the event
rate density of these special SN signals with the event rate density of
LIGO-Virgo detected BH-NS/BH systems could help to distinguish the BH-NS/BH
formation channel.

as they learn expressive non-linear models from exemplar data with minimal

However, exponential computational complexity growth with the number of
training samples has been a long standing challenge. During training, one has
to compute and invert an $N \times N$ kernel matrix at every iteration.
Regression requires computation of an $m \times N$ kernel where $N$ and $m$ are
the number of training and test points respectively. In this work we show how
approximating the covariance kernel using eigenvalues and functions leads to an
approximate Gaussian process with significant reduction in training and
regression complexity. Training with the proposed approach requires computing
only a $N \times n$ eigenfunction matrix and a $n \times n$ inverse where $n$
is a selected number of eigenvalues. Furthermore, regression now only requires
an $m \times n$ matrix. Finally, in a special case the hyperparameter
optimization is completely independent form the number of training samples. The
proposed method can regress over multiple outputs, estimate the derivative of
the regressor of any order, and learn the correlations between them. The

fluctuating about the mean value even in the the steady state. We develop here
a stochastic model motivated by length fluctuations of a type of appendage of
an eukaryotic cell called flagellum (also called cilium). Exploiting the
techniques developed for the calculation of level-crossing statistics of random
excursions of stochastic process, we have derived analytical expressions of
passage times for hitting various thresholds, sojourn times of random
excursions beyond the threshold and the extreme lengths attained during the
lifetime of these model flagella. We identify different parameter regimes of
this model flagellum that mimic those of the wildtype and mutants of a well
known flagellated cell. By analysing our model in these different parameter
regimes, we demonstrate how mutation can alter the level-crossing statistics
even when the steady state length remains unaffected by the same mutation.
Comparison of the theoretically predicted level crossing statistics, in
addition to mean and variance of the length, in the steady state with the
corresponding experimental data can be used in near future as stringent tests
for the validity of the models of flagellar length control. The experimental
data required for this purpose, though never reported till now, can be

temperature, locality and correlation, of the system. The key idea is that the
thermal states of the system encode the information of eigenvalues and
eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian. To obtain the full spectrum of the
Hamiltonian, we use a quantum imaginary time evolution algorithm with high
temperature, which prepares a thermal state with a small correlation length.
With Trotterization, this then allows us to implement each step of imaginary
time evolution by a local unitary transformation on only a small number of
sites. Diagonalizing these thermal states hence leads to a full knowledge of
the Hamiltonian eigensystem. We apply our algorithm to diagonalize local
Hamiltonians and return results with high precision. Our VQHD algorithm sheds
new light on the applications of near-term quantum computers.

Monitoring (NILM), performance evaluation can be conducted on real-world
aggregate signals, provided by smart energy meters or artificial superpositions
of individual load signals (i.e., denoised aggregates). It has long been

results mainly due to the the fact that the signal is less complex. Complexity
in real-world aggregate signals increases with the number of unknown/untracked

in the actual performance gap between real and denoised testing is still

strong tendency towards load disaggregation algorithms providing significantly
better performance on denoised aggregate signals. A closer look into the

have an impact on machine learning methods applied to traffic signal control.
In particular, we show that the average network flow tends to be independent of
the signal control policy as density increases. This property, which so far has
remained under the radar, implies that deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
methods becomes ineffective when trained under congested conditions, and might
explain DRL's limited success for traffic signal control. Our results apply to
all possible grid networks thanks to a parametrization based on two network
parameters: the ratio of the expected distance between consecutive traffic
lights to the expected green time, and the turning probability at
intersections. Networks with different parameters exhibit very different
responses to traffic signal control. Notably, we found that no control (i.e.
random policy) can be an effective control strategy for a surprisingly large
family of networks. The impact of the turning probability turned out to be very
significant both for baseline and for DRL policies. It also explains the loss
of symmetry observed for these policies, which is not captured by existing
theories that rely on corridor approximations without turns. Our findings also
suggest that supervised learning methods have enormous potential as they
require very little examples to produce excellent policies.

could adversely impact app reliability and user experience, leading to loss of
income. It is very challenging to balance the ad revenue and user experience
for app developers.
  In this paper, we present a large-scale analysis on ad-related user feedback.
The large user feedback data from App Store and Google Play allow us to
summarize ad-related app issues comprehensively and thus provide practical ad
integration strategies for developers. We first define common ad issues by
manually labeling a statistically representative sample of ad-related feedback,
and then build an automatic classifier to categorize ad-related feedback. We
study the relations between different ad issues and user ratings to identify
the ad issues poorly scored by users. We also explore the fix durations of ad
issues across platforms for extracting insights into prioritizing ad issues for
ad maintenance.
  We summarize 15 types of ad issues by manually annotating 903/36,309
ad-related user reviews. From a statistical analysis of 36,309 ad-related
reviews, we find that users care most about the number of unique ads and ad
display frequency during usage. Besides, users tend to give relatively lower
ratings when they report the security and notification related issues.
Regarding different platforms, we observe that the distributions of ad issues
are significantly different between App Store and Google Play. Moreover, some
ad issue types are addressed more quickly by developers than other ad issues.
We believe the findings we discovered can benefit app developers towards
balancing ad revenue and user experience while ensuring app reliability.

city, and transportation resources are the main components of urban resources.
Currently, a series of problems with transportation resources such as
unbalanced distribution and road congestion disrupt the scheduling discipline.
Therefore, it is significant to predict travel demand for urban resource
dispatching. Previously, the traditional time series models were used to
forecast travel demand, such as AR, ARIMA and so on. However, the prediction
efficiency of these methods is poor and the training time is too long. In order
to improve the performance, deep learning is used to assist prediction. But
most of the deep learning methods only utilize temporal dependence or spatial
dependence of data in the forecasting process. To address these limitations, a
novel deep learning traffic demand forecasting framework which based on Deep
Spatio-Temporal ConvLSTM is proposed in this paper. In order to evaluate the
performance of the framework, an end-to-end deep learning system is designed
and a real dataset is used. Furthermore, the proposed method can capture
temporal dependence and spatial dependence simultaneously. The closeness,
period and trend components of spatio-temporal data are used in three predicted
branches. These branches have the same network structures, but do not share
weights. Then a linear fusion method is used to get the final result. Finally,
the experimental results on DIDI order dataset of Chengdu demonstrate that our
method outperforms traditional models with accuracy and speed.

generalize the conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that are
homogenous only with a linear neuron model. As a heterogenous network model,
ONNs are based on a generalized neuron model that can encapsulate any set of
non-linear operators to boost diversity and to learn highly complex and
multi-modal functions or spaces with minimal network complexity and training
data. However, the default search method to find optimal operators in ONNs, the
so-called Greedy Iterative Search (GIS) method, usually takes several training
sessions to find a single operator set per layer. This is not only
computationally demanding, also the network heterogeneity is limited since the
same set of operators will then be used for all neurons in each layer. To
address this deficiency and exploit a superior level of heterogeneity, in this
study the focus is drawn on searching the best-possible operator set(s) for the
hidden neurons of the network based on the Synaptic Plasticity paradigm that
poses the essential learning theory in biological neurons. During training,
each operator set in the library can be evaluated by their synaptic plasticity
level, ranked from the worst to the best, and an elite ONN can then be
configured using the top ranked operator sets found at each hidden layer.
Experimental results over highly challenging problems demonstrate that the
elite ONNs even with few neurons and layers can achieve a superior learning
performance than GIS-based ONNs and as a result the performance gap over the
CNNs further widens.
