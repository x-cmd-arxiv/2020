achieved through reductions in power, particle and momentum; which are induced
through plasma-atom and plasma-molecule interactions. Experimental research in
how those reactions precisely contribute to detachment is limited. In this
work, we investigate a new spectroscopic technique to utilise Hydrogen Balmer
line measurements to 1) disentangle the Balmer line emission from the various
plasma-atom and plasma-molecule interactions; and 2) quantify their
contributions to ionisation, recombination and radiative power losses. During
detachment, the observed $H\alpha$ emission often strongly increases, which
could be an indicator for plasma-molecule interactions involving $H_2^+$ and/or
$H^-$. Our analysis technique quantifies the $H\alpha$ emission due to
plasma-molecule interactions and uses this to 1) quantify the Balmer line
emission contribution due to $H_2^+$ and/or $H^-$; 2) subsequently estimate its
resulting particle sinks/sources and radiative power losses. Its performance is
verified using synthetic diagnostic techniques of both detached TCV and MAST-U
SOLPS-ITER simulations. Experimental results of this technique on TCV data show
a bifurcation occurs between the measured total $H\alpha$ and the atomic
estimate of $H\alpha$ emission, indicative of the presence of additional
$H\alpha$ due to plasma-molecule interactions with $H_2^+$ (and/or $H^-$). An
example analysis shows that the hydrogenic line series, even $Ly\alpha$ as well
as the medium-n Balmer lines can be significantly influenced by plasma-molecule
interactions by tens of percent during which significant Molecular Activated
Recombination (MAR) is expected.

material deformation ahead of a crack tip. This also constitutes the first
fracture mechanics analysis of gradient plasticity theories adopting Nye's
tensor as primal kinematic variable. First, the asymptotic nature of crack tip
fields is analytically investigated. We show that an inner elastic region
exists, adjacent to the crack tip, where elastic strains dominate plastic
strains and Cauchy stresses follow the linear elastic stress singularity. This
finding is verified by detailed finite element analyses using a new numerical
framework, which builds upon a viscoplastic constitutive law that enables
capturing both rate-dependent and rate-independent behaviour in a
computationally efficient manner. Numerical analysis is used to gain further
insight into the stress elevation predicted by distortion gradient plasticity,
relative to conventional J2 plasticity, and the influence of the plastic spin
under both mode I and mixed-mode fracture conditions. It is found that Nye's
tensor contributions have a weaker effect in elevating the stresses in the
plastic region, while predicting the same asymptotic behaviour as constitutive
choices based on the plastic strain gradient tensor. A minor sensitivity to X,
the parameter governing the dissipation due to the plastic spin, is observed.
Finally, distortion gradient plasticity and suitable higher order boundary
conditions are used to appropriately model the phenomenon of brittle failure
along elastic-plastic material interfaces. We reproduce paradigmatic
experiments on niobium-sapphire interfaces and show that the combination of
strain gradient hardening and dislocation blockage leads to interface crack tip
stresses that are larger than the theoretical lattice strength, rationalising
cleavage in the presence of plasticity at bi-material interfaces.

boundary premelting and then quenched through a procedure that induces a
gradient of local cooling rate through the sample height. Amorphous complexion
thickness distributions were found to be invariant to local cooling rate in the
Cu-Zr-Hf alloy, demonstrating enhanced stability of the amorphous complexion
structure compared to the Cu-Zr alloy, which had thinner amorphous complexions
in the regions that were slowly cooled. The experimental results are used to
construct time-temperature-transformation diagrams of the amorphous-to-ordered
complexion transition for both the binary and ternary alloys, enabling a deeper
understanding of the influence of cooling rate and grain boundary chemistry on
complexion transitions. The critical cooling rate necessary to avoid complexion
transitions in the ternary alloy is found to be at least three orders of
magnitude slower than that for the binary alloy.

mass-segregated young stellar clusters composed of Sun-like stars, brown
dwarves, and massive O-type(50-100\msun) stars. Aims: To identify candidate
hub-filament systems (HFS) in the Milky-Way and examine their role in the
formation of the highest mass stars and star clusters. Methods: Filaments
around ~35000 HiGAL clumps that are detected using the DisPerSE algorithm. Hub
is defined as a junction of three or more filaments. Column density maps were
masked by the filament skeletons and averaged for HFS and non-HFS samples to
compute the radial profile along the filaments into the clumps. Results:
~3700~(11\%) are candidate HFS of which, ~2150~(60\%) are pre-stellar,
~1400~(40\%) are proto-stellar. All clumps with L>10^4 Lsun and L>10^5 Lsun at
distances respectively within 2kpc and 5kpc are located in the hubs of HFS. The
column-densities of hubs are found to be enhanced by a factor of ~2
(pre-stellar sources) up to ~10 (proto-stellar sources). Conclusions: All
high-mass stars preferentially form in the density enhanced hubs of HFS. This
amplification can drive the observed longitudinal flows along filaments
providing further mass accretion. Radiation pressure and feedback can escape
into the inter-filamentary voids. We propose a ""filaments to clusters"" unified
paradigm for star formation, with the following salient features: a)
low-intermediate mass stars form in the filaments slowly (10^6yr) and massive
stars quickly (10^5yr) in the hub, b) the initial mass function is the sum of
stars continuously created in the HFS with all massive stars formed in the hub,
c) Feedback dissiption and mass segregation arise naturally due to HFS
properties, and c) explain age spreads within bound clusters and formation of
isolated OB associations.

input-output functionality of a database index can be viewed as a prediction
task and, thus, be implemented using a machine learning model instead of
traditional algorithmic techniques. This novel angle for a decades-old problem
has inspired numerous exciting results in the intersection of machine learning
and data structures. However, the main advantage of learned index structures,
i.e., the ability to adjust to the data at hand via the underlying ML-model,
can become a disadvantage from a security perspective as it could be exploited.
  In this work, we present the first study of poisoning attacks on learned
index structures. The required poisoning approach is different from all
previous works since the model under attack is trained on a cumulative
distribution function (CDF) and, thus, every injection on the training set has
a cascading impact on multiple data values. We formulate the first poisoning
attacks on linear regression models trained on the CDF, which is a basic
building block of the proposed learned index structures. We generalize our
poisoning techniques to attack a more advanced two-stage design of learned
index structures called recursive model index (RMI), which has been shown to
outperform traditional B-Trees. We evaluate our attacks on real-world and
synthetic datasets under a wide variety of parameterizations of the model and
show that the error of the RMI increases up to $300\times$ and the error of its
second-stage models increases up to $3000\times$.

convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that are capable of learning
representations or features given a set of data. Making sense of such complex
models (i.e., millions of parameters and hundreds of layers) remains
challenging for developers as well as the end-users. This is partially due to
the lack of tools or interfaces capable of providing interpretability and
transparency. A growing body of literature, for example, class activation map
(CAM), focuses on making sense of what a model learns from the data or why it
behaves poorly in a given task. This paper builds on previous ideas to cope
with the increasing demand for interpretable, robust, and transparent models.
Our approach provides a simpler and intuitive (or familiar) way of generating
CAM. The proposed Eigen-CAM computes and visualizes the principle components of
the learned features/representations from the convolutional layers. Empirical
studies were performed to compare the Eigen-CAM with the state-of-the-art
methods (such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, CNN-fixations) by evaluating on
benchmark datasets such as weakly-supervised localization and localizing
objects in the presence of adversarial noise. Eigen-CAM was found to be robust
against classification errors made by fully connected layers in CNNs, does not
rely on the backpropagation of gradients, class relevance score, maximum
activation locations, or any other form of weighting features. In addition, it
works with all CNN models without the need to modify layers or retrain models.
Empirical results show up to 12% improvement over the best method among the

tumor staging ranging and ECOG performance status, are commonly seen in medical
settings. Statistically, it may be difficult to determine the functional form
of an ordinal predictor variable. Often, such a variable is dichotomized based
on whether it is above or below a certain cutoff. Other methods conveniently
treat the ordinal predictor as a continuous variable and assume a linear
relationship with the outcome. However, arbitrarily choosing a method may lead
to inaccurate inference and treatment. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian
mixture model to simultaneously assess the appropriate form of the predictor in
regression models by considering the presence of a changepoint through the lens
of a threshold detection problem. By using a mixture model framework to
consider both dichotomous and linear forms for the variable, the estimate is a
weighted average of linear and binary parameterizations. This method is
applicable to continuous, binary, and survival outcomes, and easily amenable to
penalized regression. We evaluated the proposed method using simulation studies

the debris disk around HD 15115 with the Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive
Optics system (SCExAO) coupled with the Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution
Imaging Spectrograph (CHARIS). SCExAO/CHARIS resolves the disk down to $\rho
\sim 0.2''$ ($\rm{r_{proj}} \sim 10$ $\rm{au}$), a factor of $\sim 3-5$ smaller
than previous recent studies. We derive a disk position angle of $\rm{PA}$
$\sim 279.4^\circ - 280.5^\circ$ and an inclination of $\rm{i}$ $\sim
85.3^\circ - 86.2^\circ$. While recent SPHERE/IRDIS imagery of the system could
suggest a significantly misaligned two ring disk geometry, CHARIS imagery does
not reveal conclusive evidence for this hypothesis. Moreover, optimizing models
of both one and two ring geometries using differential evolution, we find that
a single ring having a Hong-like scattering phase function matches the data
equally well within the CHARIS field of view ($\rho \lesssim 1''$). The disk's
asymmetry, well-evidenced at larger separations, is also recovered; the west
side of the disk appears on average around 0.4 magnitudes brighter across the
CHARIS bandpass between $0.25''$ and $1''$. Comparing STIS/50CCD optical
photometry ($2000-10500$ $\r{A}$) with CHARIS NIR photometry, we find a red
(STIS/50CCD$-$CHARIS broadband) color for both sides of the disk throughout the
$0.4'' - 1''$ region of overlap, in contrast to the blue color reported at
similar wavelengths for regions exterior to $\sim 2''$. Further, this color may
suggest a smaller minimum grain size than previously estimated at larger
separations. Finally, we provide constraints on planetary companions, and
discuss possible mechanisms for the observed inner disk flux asymmetry and

HAWC+/SOFIA at 53, 89, 154, and 214 $\mu$m. We find that the shape of the
far-infrared polarization spectrum is variable across the cloud and that there
is evidence of a correlation between the slope of the polarization spectrum and
the average line-of-sight temperature. The slope of the polarization spectrum
tends to be negative (falling toward longer wavelengths) in cooler regions and
positive or flat in warmer regions. This is very similar to what was discovered
in $\rho$ Oph A via SOFIA polarimetry at 89 and 154 $\mu$m. Like the authors of
this earlier work, we argue that the most natural explanation for our falling
spectra is line-of-sight superposition of differing grain populations, with
polarized emission from the warmer regions and less-polarized emission from the
cooler ones. In contrast with the earlier work on $\rho$ Oph A, we do not find
a clear correlation of polarization spectrum slope with column density. This
suggests that falling spectra are attributable to variations in grain alignment
efficiency in a heterogeneous cloud consistent with radiative torques theory.
Alternative explanations in which variations in grain alignment efficiency are
caused by varying gas density rather than by varying radiation intensity are
disfavored.

the policy employed ensures the satisfaction of a set of constraints. The
analytical formulation usually takes the form of a Constrained Markov Decision
Process (CMDP). We focus on the case where the CMDP is unknown, and RL
algorithms obtain samples to discover the model and compute an optimal
constrained policy. Our goal is to characterize the relationship between safety
constraints and the number of samples needed to ensure a desired level of
accuracy -- both objective maximization and constraint satisfaction -- in a PAC
sense. We explore two classes of RL algorithms, namely, (i) a generative model
based approach, wherein samples are taken initially to estimate a model, and
(ii) an online approach, wherein the model is updated as samples are obtained.
Our main finding is that compared to the best known bounds of the unconstrained
regime, the sample complexity of constrained RL algorithms are increased by a
factor that is logarithmic in the number of constraints, which suggests that
the approach may be easily utilized in real systems.

Past schemes that used only klinokinesis can follow the contour efficiently but
take excessive time to reach the setpoint. We address this shortcoming by
proposing a novel adaptive klinotaxis mechanism that builds upon a previously
proposed gradient climbing circuit. We demonstrate how our klinotaxis circuit
can autonomously be configured to perform gradient ascent, gradient descent and
subsequently be disabled to seamlessly integrate with the aforementioned
klinokinesis circuit. We also incorporate speed regulation (orthokinesis) to
further improve contour tracking performance. Thus for the first time, we
present a model that successfully integrates klinokinesis, klinotaxis and
orthokinesis. We demonstrate via contour tracking simulations that our proposed
scheme achieves an 2.4x reduction in the time to reach the setpoint, along with
a simultaneous 8.7x reduction in average deviation from the setpoint.

dynamics which leads to the emergence of periodic nonequilibrium structures.
One of the most prominent equations for the theoretical and numerical study of
the evolution of these textures is the Swift-Hohenberg (SH) equation, which
presents a bifurcation parameter (forcing) that controls the dynamics by
changing the energy landscape of the system, and has been largely employed in
phase-field models. Though a large part of the literature on pattern formation
addresses uniformly forced systems, nonuniform forcings are also observed in
several natural systems, for instance, in developmental biology and in soft
matter applications. In these cases, an orientation effect due to forcing
gradients is a new factor playing a role in the development of patterns,
particularly in the class of stripe patterns, which we investigate through the
nonuniformly forced SH dynamics. The present work addresses amplitude
instability of stripe textures induced by forcing gradients, and the
competition between the orientation effect of the gradient and other bulk,
boundary, and geometric effects taking part in the selection of the emerging
patterns. A weakly nonlinear analysis suggests that stripes are stable with
respect to small amplitude perturbations when aligned with the gradient, and
become unstable to such perturbations when when aligned perpendicularly to the
gradient. This analysis is vastly complemented by a numerical work that
accounts for other effects, confirming that forcing gradients drive stripe
alignment, or even reorient them from preexisting conditions. However, we
observe that the orientation effect does not always prevail in the face of
competing effects, whose hierarchy is suggested to depend on the magnitude of
the forcing gradient.

Chris Fuchs and Asher Peres presented a series of instrumentalist arguments
against the role played by 'interpretations' in QM. Since then --quite
regardless of the publication of this paper-- the number of interpretations has
experienced a continuous growth constituting what Adan Cabello has
characterized as a ""map of madness"". In this work, we discuss the reasons
behind this dangerous fragmentation in understanding and provide new arguments
against the need of interpretations in QM which --opposite to those of Fuchs
and Peres-- are derived from a representational realist understanding of
theories --grounded in the writings of Einstein, Heisenberg and Pauli.
Furthermore, we will argue that there are reasons to believe that the creation
of 'interpretations' for the theory of quanta has functioned as a trap designed
by anti-realists in order to imprison realists in a labyrinth with no exit.
Taking as a standpoint the critical analysis by David Deutsch to the
anti-realist understanding of physics, we attempt to address the references and
roles played by 'theory' and 'observation'. In this respect, we will argue that
the key to escape the anti-realist trap of interpretation is to recognize that
--as Einstein told Heisenberg almost one century ago-- it is only the theory
which can tell you what can be observed. Finally, we will conclude that what QM
needs is not a new interpretation but instead, a theoretical
(formal-conceptual) consistent, coherent and unified scheme which allows us to
understand what the theory is really talking about.

often impeded for data with large numbers of observations, $N$, due to the
cubic (in $N$) cost of matrix operations used in exact inference. Many
solutions have been proposed that rely on $M \ll N$ inducing variables to form
an approximation at a cost of $\mathcal{O}(NM^2)$. While the computational cost
appears linear in $N$, the true complexity depends on how $M$ must scale with
$N$ to ensure a certain quality of the approximation. In this work, we
investigate upper and lower bounds on how $M$ needs to grow with $N$ to ensure
high quality approximations. We show that we can make the KL-divergence between
the approximate model and the exact posterior arbitrarily small for a
Gaussian-noise regression model with $M\ll N$. Specifically, for the popular
squared exponential kernel and $D$-dimensional Gaussian distributed covariates,
$M=\mathcal{O}((\log N)^D)$ suffice and a method with an overall computational
cost of $\mathcal{O}(N(\log N)^{2D}(\log\log N)^2)$ can be used to perform
inference.

grasping and manipulation. The need for reliable grasping imposes stringent
accuracy requirements on pose estimation in cluttered, occluded scenes in
dynamic environments. Modern methods employ large sets of training data to
learn features in order to find correspondence between 3D models and observed
data. However these methods require extensive annotation of ground truth poses.
An alternative is to use algorithms that search for the best explanation of the
observed scene in a space of possible rendered scenes. A recently developed
algorithm, PERCH (PErception Via SeaRCH) does so by using depth data to
converge to a globally optimum solution using a search over a specially
constructed tree. While PERCH offers strong guarantees on accuracy, the current
formulation suffers from low scalability owing to its high runtime. In
addition, the sole reliance on depth data for pose estimation restricts the
algorithm to scenes where no two objects have the same shape. In this work, we
propose PERCH 2.0, a novel perception via search strategy that takes advantage
of GPU acceleration and RGB data. We show that our approach can achieve a
speedup of 100x over PERCH, as well as better accuracy than the
state-of-the-art data-driven approaches on 6-DoF pose estimation without the

finite complex X that is mod $p$ acyclic, then its space of fixed points, X^G,
will also be mod p acyclic.
  In their recent study of the Balmer spectrum of equivariant stable homotopy
theory, Balmer and Sanders were led to study chromatic versions of this
statement, with the question: given H<G and n, what is the smallest r such that
if X^H is acyclic in the (n+r)th Morava K-theory, then X^G must be acyclic in
the nth Morava K-theory? Barthel et.al. then answered this when G is abelian,
by finding general lower and upper bounds for these `blue shift' numbers which
agree in the abelian case.
  In our paper, we first prove that these potential chromatic versions of
Smith's theorem are equivalent to chromatic versions of a 1952 theorem of
E.E.Floyd, which replaces acyclicity by bounds on dimensions of homology, and
thus applies to all finite G-spaces. This unlocks new techniques and
applications in chromatic fixed point theory.
  In one direction, we are able to use classic constructions and representation
theory to search for blue shift number lower bounds. We give a simple new proof
of the known lower bound theorem, and then get the first results about
nonabelian 2-groups that don't follow from previously known results. In
particular, we are able to determine all blue shift numbers for extraspecial
2-groups.

constraints. Imagine a medical study where a dataset is sampled from a
population of both healthy and unhealthy individuals. Suppose healthy
individuals have no privacy concerns (in such case, we call their data
""public"") while the unhealthy individuals desire stringent privacy protection
for their data. In this example, the population (data distribution) is a
mixture of private (unhealthy) and public (healthy) sub-populations that could
be very different.
  Inspired by the above example, we consider a model in which the population
$\mathcal{D}$ is a mixture of two sub-populations: a private sub-population
$\mathcal{D}_{\sf priv}$ of private and sensitive data, and a public
sub-population $\mathcal{D}_{\sf pub}$ of data with no privacy concerns. Each
example drawn from $\mathcal{D}$ is assumed to contain a privacy-status bit
that indicates whether the example is private or public. The goal is to design
a learning algorithm that satisfies differential privacy only with respect to
the private examples.
  Prior works in this context assumed a homogeneous population where private
and public data arise from the same distribution, and in particular designed
solutions which exploit this assumption. We demonstrate how to circumvent this
assumption by considering, as a case study, the problem of learning linear
classifiers in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We show that in the case where the privacy
status is correlated with the target label (as in the above example), linear
classifiers in $\mathbb{R}^d$ can be learned, in the agnostic as well as the
realizable setting, with sample complexity which is comparable to that of the
classical (non-private) PAC-learning. It is known that this task is impossible
if all the data is considered private.

adopted, there is a growing appetite for private analytics on big data. Most
prior works on data-oblivious algorithms adopt the classical PRAM model to
capture parallelism. However, it is widely understood that PRAM does not best
capture realistic multicore processors, nor does it reflect parallel
programming models adopted in practice.
  In this paper, we initiate the study of parallel data oblivious algorithms on
realistic multicores, best captured by the binary fork-join model of
computation. We first show that data-oblivious sorting can be accomplished by a
binary fork-join algorithm with optimal total work and optimal
(cache-oblivious) cache complexity, and in O(log n log log n) span (i.e.,
parallel time) that matches the best-known insecure algorithm. Using our
sorting algorithm as a core primitive, we show how to data-obliviously simulate
general PRAM algorithms in the binary fork-join model with non-trivial
efficiency. We also present results for several applications including list
ranking, Euler tour, tree contraction, connected components, and minimum
spanning forest. For a subset of these applications, our data-oblivious
algorithms asymptotically outperform the best known insecure algorithms. For
other applications, we show data oblivious algorithms whose performance bounds
match the best known insecure algorithms.
  Complementing these asymptotically efficient results, we present a practical
variant of our sorting algorithm that is self-contained and potentially
implementable. It has optimal caching cost, and it is only a log log n factor
off from optimal work and about a log n factor off in terms of span; moreover,
it achieves small constant factors in its bounds.

as early as possible, which is critical to safety-guaranteed self-driving
systems. With cluttered traffic scenes and limited visual cues, it is of great
challenge to predict how long there will be an accident from early observed
frames. Most existing approaches are developed to learn features of
accident-relevant agents for accident anticipation, while ignoring the features
of their spatial and temporal relations. Besides, current deterministic deep
neural networks could be overconfident in false predictions, leading to high
risk of traffic accidents caused by self-driving systems. In this paper, we
propose an uncertainty-based accident anticipation model with spatio-temporal
relational learning. It sequentially predicts the probability of traffic
accident occurrence with dashcam videos. Specifically, we propose to take
advantage of graph convolution and recurrent networks for relational feature
learning, and leverage Bayesian neural networks to address the intrinsic
variability of latent relational representations. The derived uncertainty-based
ranking loss is found to significantly boost model performance by improving the
quality of relational features. In addition, we collect a new Car Crash Dataset

resolution better than 30 ps providing exceptional particle identification
capabilities. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous detector designs that
suffered from large neutral hadron resolution degradation from one interaction
length of crystals in front of a sampling hadron calorimeter, the
implementation of dual-readout on crystals permits to achieve a resolution
better than $30\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 2\%$ for neutral hadrons. Our studies find
that the integration of crystal calorimetry into future Higgs factory collider

Some of this aggregated information is referring to events that could or should

actionable information that serves this purpose. First, we show that predicting
time to event is possible for both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Second, we suggest a method which facilitates the definition of relevance for
an analyst's context and the use of this definition to analyze new data.
Finally, we propose a method to integrate the machine learning based relevant
information classification method with a rule-based information classification
technique to classify microtexts. Fully automatizing microtext analysis has
been our goal since the first day of this research project. Our efforts in this
direction informed us about the extent this automation can be realized. We
mostly first developed an automated approach, then we extended and improved it
by integrating human intervention at various steps of the automated approach.
Our experience confirms previous work that states that a well-designed human
intervention or contribution in design, realization, or evaluation of an
information system either improves its performance or enables its realization.
As our studies and results directed us toward its necessity and value, we were
inspired from previous studies in designing human involvement and customized

efficiently the effect of open-loop control on the linear stability properties
of unstable flows. Sensitivity maps identify regions where small-amplitude
control is the most effective, i.e. yields the largest first-order (linear)
eigenvalue variation. In this study an adjoint method is proposed for computing
a second-order (quadratic) sensitivity operator, and applied to the flow past a
circular cylinder, controlled with a steady body force or a passive device
model. Maps of second-order eigenvalue variations are obtained, without
computing controlled base flows and eigenmodes. For finite control amplitudes,
the second-order analysis improves the accuracy of the first-order prediction,
and informs about its range of validity, and whether it underestimates or
overestimates the actual eigenvalue variation. Regions are identified where
control has little or no first-order effect but a second-order effect. In the
cylinder wake, the effect of a control cylinder tends to be underestimated by
the first-order sensitivity, and including second-order effects yields larger
regions of flow restabilisation. Second-order effects can be decomposed into
two mechanisms: second-order base flow modification, and interaction between
first-order modifications of the base flow and eigenmode. Both contribute
equally in general in sensitive regions of the cylinder wake. Exploiting the
second-order sensitivity operator, the optimal control maximising the total
second-order stabilisation is computed via a quadratic eigenvalue problem. The
approach is applicable to other types of control (e.g. wall blowing/suction and
shape deformation) and other eigenvalue problems (e.g. amplification of
time-harmonic perturbations, or resolvent gain, in stable flows).

been of both theoretical interest and engineering importance. As a new class of
materials with an intrinsic compositional disorder, high/medium-entropy alloys
(HEAs/MEAs) are being immensely studied mainly for their excellent mechanical
properties. By contrast, electrical and thermal transport properties of
HEAs/MEAs are less well studied. Here we investigate these two properties of
silicon (Si)-germanium (Ge)-tin (Sn) MEAs, where we keep the same content of Si
and Ge while increasing the content of Sn from 0 to 1/3 to tune the
configurational entropy and thus the degree of compositional disorder. We
predict all SiyGeySnx MEAs to be semiconductors with a wide range of bandgaps
from near-infrared (0.28 eV) to visible (1.11 eV) in the light spectrum. We
find that the bandgaps and effective carrier masses decrease with increasing Sn
content. As a result, increasing the compositional disorder in SiyGeySnx MEAs
enhances their electrical conductivity. For the thermal transport properties of
SiyGeySnx MEAs, our molecular dynamics simulations show an opposite trend in
the thermal conductivity of these MEAs at room temperature, which decreases
with increasing compositional disorder, owing to enhanced Anderson localization
and strong phonon-phonon anharmonic interactions. The enhanced electrical
conductivity and weakened thermal conductivity make SiyGeySnx MEAs with high Sn
content promising functional materials for thermoelectric applications. Our
work demonstrates that HEAs/MEAs not only represent a new class of structural
alloys but also a novel category of functional alloys with unique electrical

proposed traps are broadband in the sense that can be set with beams
oscillating at any frequency within the wide range in which the metasurface
supports surface plasmons. Over that range, the metasurface evolves from an
anisotropic elliptic to a hyperbolic regime through a topological transition
and enables optical traps with distinctive spatially asymmetric potential
distribution, local potential barriers arising from the momentum imbalance of
the excited plasmons, and an enhanced potential depth that permits the stable

performance of this platform, we develop a rigorous formalism based on the

learning across a wide range of high-stakes applications, e.g., health care,
security, criminal justice, finance, and education, there is a growing need for
effective techniques for explaining such models and their predictions. We aim
to address this problem in settings where the predictive model is a black box;
That is, we can only observe the response of the model to various inputs, but
have no knowledge about the internal structure of the predictive model, its
parameters, the objective function, and the algorithm used to optimize the
model. We reduce the problem of interpreting a black box predictive model to
that of estimating the causal effects of each of the model inputs on the model
output, from observations of the model inputs and the corresponding outputs. We
estimate the causal effects of model inputs on model output using variants of
the Rubin Neyman potential outcomes framework for estimating causal effects
from observational data. We show how the resulting causal attribution of
responsibility for model output to the different model inputs can be used to
interpret the predictive model and to explain its predictions. We present
results of experiments that demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to
the interpretation of black box predictive models via causal attribution in the
case of deep neural network models trained on one synthetic data set (where the
input variables that impact the output variable are known by design) and two
real-world data sets: Handwritten digit classification, and Parkinson's disease
severity prediction. Because our approach does not require knowledge about the
predictive model algorithm and is free of assumptions regarding the black box
predictive model except that its input-output responses be observable, it can
be applied, in principle, to any black box predictive model.

ultrarelativistic electron-positron plasma, also known as the chirality
flipping rate. We find that contrary to the existing estimates, the chirality
flipping rate appears already in the first order in the fine-structure constant
$\alpha$ and is therefore orders of magnitude greater than previously believed.
The main channels for the rapid relaxation of the axial charge are the
collinear emission of a weakly damped photon and the Compton scattering. The
latter contributes to the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ result because of the infrared
divergence in its cross section, which is regularized on the soft scale $\sim
eT$ due to the thermal corrections. Our results are important for the
description of the early Universe processes (such as leptogenesis or
magnetogenesis) that affect differently left- and right-chiral fermions of the
Standard Model, as discussed in more details in the companion Letter.

animating a still image without operating in 3D domain. Whereas, prior arts can
only animate small images (typically no larger than 512x512) due to memory
limitations, difficulty of training and lack of high-resolution (HD) training
datasets, which significantly reduce their potential for applications in movie
production and interactive systems. Motivated by the idea that HD images can be
generated by adding high-frequency residuals to low-resolution results produced
by a neural network, we propose a novel framework known as Animating Through
Warping (ATW) to enable efficient animation of HD images.
  Specifically, the proposed framework consists of two modules, a novel
two-stage neural-network generator and a novel post-processing module known as
Animating Through Warping (ATW). It only requires the generator to be trained
on small images and can do inference on an image of any size. During inference,
an HD input image is decomposed into a low-resolution component(128x128) and
its corresponding high-frequency residuals. The generator predicts the
low-resolution result as well as the motion field that warps the input face to
the desired status (e.g., expressions categories or action units). Finally, the
ResWarp module warps the residuals based on the motion field and adding the
warped residuals to generates the final HD results from the naively up-sampled
low-resolution results. Experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of
our method in generating high-resolution animations. Our proposed framework
successfully animates a 4K facial image, which has never been achieved by prior
neural models. In addition, our method generally guarantee the temporal
coherency of the generated animations. Source codes will be made publicly

previous, smaller-scale studies using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation. The
probability density functions of the avalanche sizes and waiting times are
consistent with both exponential and log-normal distributions. We find weak

sparse landmark-based maps due to their real-time performance. However, these
techniques frequently assert that these landmarks are fixed in position over
time, known as the static-world assumption. This is rarely, if ever, the case
in most real-world environments. Even worse, over long deployments, robots are
bound to observe traditionally static landmarks change, for example when an
autonomous vehicle encounters a construction zone. This work addresses this
challenge, accounting for changes in complex three-dimensional environments
with the creation of a probabilistic filter that operates on the features that
give rise to landmarks. To accomplish this, landmarks are clustered into
cliques and a filter is developed to estimate their persistence jointly among
observations of the landmarks in a clique. This filter uses estimated
spatial-temporal priors of geometric objects, allowing for dynamic and
semi-static objects to be removed from a formally static map. The proposed
algorithm is validated in a 3D simulated environment.

from out-of-plane to in-plane easy axis configuration for fixed film thickness.
Contributions from conventional dipolar and orbital moment terms are
insufficient to explain the observed evolution of magnetic behavior with

none are substantially better than climatological forecasts. Space weather
researchers are increasingly looking towards methods used by the terrestrial
weather community to improve current forecasting techniques. Ensemble
forecasting has been used in numerical weather prediction for many years as a
way to combine different predictions in order to obtain a more accurate result.
Here we construct ensemble forecasts for major solar flares by linearly
combining the full-disk probabilistic forecasts from a group of operational
forecasting methods (ASAP, ASSA, MAG4, MOSWOC, NOAA, and MCSTAT). Forecasts
from each method are weighted by a factor that accounts for the method's
ability to predict previous events, and several performance metrics (both
probabilistic and categorical) are considered. It is found that most ensembles
achieve a better skill metric (between 5\% and 15\%) than any of the members
alone. Moreover, over 90\% of ensembles perform better (as measured by forecast
attributes) than a simple equal-weights average. Finally, ensemble
uncertainties are highly dependent on the internal metric being optimized and
they are estimated to be less than 20\% for probabilities greater than 0.2.
This simple multi-model, linear ensemble technique can provide operational
space weather centres with the basis for constructing a versatile ensemble
forecasting system -- an improved starting point to their forecasts that can be
tailored to different end-user needs.

can disperse the distribution of H$_2$ and HI fraction. We find that the energy
spectrum of moment maps gets shallower when the sonic Mach number MS increases.
We explore the ability in magnetic field tracing of gradients of higher-order
velocity centroids and compare their performance with that of traditional
velocity centroid gradients (VCGs) and with intensity gradients (IGs). We find
that the velocity gradients of the second-order centroids (VC$_2$Gs) are more

This problem can be formulated as a bi-objective optimization problem for

control. However, due to the large number of supplies, difficulties in
evaluating the effects, and the strict budget constraint, it is difficult for
existing evolutionary multiobjective algorithms to efficiently approximate the
Pareto front of the problem. In this paper, we present an approach that first
transforms the original high-dimensional, constrained multiobjective
optimization problem to a low-dimensional, unconstrained multiobjective
optimization problem, and then evaluates each solution to the transformed
problem by solving a set of simple single-objective optimization subproblems,
such that the problem can be efficiently solved by existing evolutionary

significantly better performance than that of directly solving the original

optimization based on problem-specific knowledge can be an efficient solution
approach to many other complex problems and, therefore, enlarge the application

  compositions",,,,,"stat.ME stat.AP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Studying the human microbiome has gained substantial interest in recent
years, and a common task in the analysis of these data is to cluster microbiome
compositions into subtypes. This subdivision of samples into subgroups serves
as an intermediary step in achieving personalized diagnosis and treatment. In
applying existing clustering methods to modern microbiome studies including the
American Gut Project (AGP) data, we found that this seemingly standard task,
however, is very challenging in the microbiome composition context due to
several key features of such data. Standard distance-based clustering
algorithms generally do not produce reliable results as they do not take into
account the heterogeneity of the cross-sample variability among the bacterial
taxa, while existing model-based approaches do not allow sufficient flexibility
for the identification of complex within-cluster variation from cross-cluster
variation. Direct applications of such methods generally lead to overly
dispersed clusters in the AGP data and such phenomenon is common for other
microbiome data. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dirichlet-tree
multinomial mixtures (DTMM) as a Bayesian generative model for clustering
amplicon sequencing data in microbiome studies. DTMM models the microbiome
population with a mixture of Dirichlet-tree kernels that utilizes the
phylogenetic tree to offer a more flexible covariance structure in
characterizing within-cluster variation, and it provides a means for
identifying a subset of signature taxa that distinguish the clusters. We
perform extensive simulation studies to evaluate the performance of DTMM and
compare it to state-of-the-art model-based and distance-based clustering
methods in the microbiome context. Finally, we report a case study on the fecal

finetuned on many directions at the same time. Compared to multilingual models

of large quantities of unlabeled monolingual data, which is particularly

various fields. As training deep models usually consumes massive data and
computational resources, trading the trained deep models is highly demanded and
lucrative nowadays. Unfortunately, the naive trading schemes typically involves
potential risks related to copyright and trustworthiness issues, e.g., a sold
model can be illegally resold to others without further authorization to reap
huge profits. To tackle this problem, various watermarking techniques are
proposed to protect the model intellectual property, amongst which the
backdoor-based watermarking is the most commonly-used one. However, the
robustness of these watermarking approaches is not well evaluated under
realistic settings, such as limited in-distribution data availability and
agnostic of watermarking patterns. In this paper, we benchmark the robustness
of watermarking, and propose a novel backdoor-based watermark removal framework
using limited data, dubbed WILD. The proposed WILD removes the watermarks of
deep models with only a small portion of training data, and the output model
can perform the same as models trained from scratch without watermarks
injected. In particular, a novel data augmentation method is utilized to mimic
the behavior of watermark triggers. Combining with the distribution alignment
between the normal and perturbed (e.g., occluded) data in the feature space,
our approach generalizes well on all typical types of trigger contents. The
experimental results demonstrate that our approach can effectively remove the
watermarks without compromising the deep model performance for the original
task with the limited access to training data.

vary from case to case, here, by a humanly interpretable classifier we restrict
it to be expressed in simplistic mathematical terms. As a novel approach, we
represent a classifier as an assembly of simple mathematical rules using a
non-linear decision tree (NLDT). Each conditional (non-terminal) node of the
tree represents a non-linear mathematical rule (split-rule) involving features
in order to partition the dataset in the given conditional node into two
non-overlapping subsets. This partitioning is intended to minimize the impurity
of the resulting child nodes. By restricting the structure of split-rule at
each conditional node and depth of the decision tree, the interpretability of
the classifier is assured. The non-linear split-rule at a given conditional
node is obtained using an evolutionary bilevel optimization algorithm, in which
while the upper-level focuses on arriving at an interpretable structure of the
split-rule, the lower-level achieves the most appropriate weights
(coefficients) of individual constituents of the rule to minimize the net
impurity of two resulting child nodes. The performance of the proposed
algorithm is demonstrated on a number of controlled test problems, existing
benchmark problems, and industrial problems. Results on two to 500-feature

observational in nature, where atmospheric phenomena are recreated through the
usage of appropriate substitutes. Miniature droplets were created inside a
box-like setup through the use of dry ice to cool the water vapor rising up, so
as to create suspended water droplets, and to induce precipitation of heavier
droplets. The experiment resulted in the creation of precipitated droplets,
which were found at the base of the chamber at 99-100% relative humidity. The
suspended droplets were used to study factors such as luminosity and variation
of droplet sizes with turbulence. It was found that up to 14.4 m/s of
turbulence, the droplet sizes increase with an increase in turbulence, with the
luminosity decreasing with increase in turbulence. The gaussian profile of
droplet size distribution has also been obtained, with a standard deviation of
2.83, 3.01 and 3.18 for low, medium and high turbulence speeds respectively.
The experiment can be extended to incorporate a higher number of variables, so
as to include a wider range of atmospheric phenomena.

attention due to their great capability in recovering high-frequency details on
real low-quality images. However, most of these methods require a high-quality
reference image of the same identity, making them only applicable in limited
scenes. To address this issue, this paper suggests a deep face dictionary
network (termed as DFDNet) to guide the restoration process of degraded
observations. To begin with, we use K-means to generate deep dictionaries for
perceptually significant face components (\ie, left/right eyes, nose and mouth)
from high-quality images. Next, with the degraded input, we match and select
the most similar component features from their corresponding dictionaries and
transfer the high-quality details to the input via the proposed dictionary
feature transfer (DFT) block. In particular, component AdaIN is leveraged to
eliminate the style diversity between the input and dictionary features (\eg,
illumination), and a confidence score is proposed to adaptively fuse the
dictionary feature to the input. Finally, multi-scale dictionaries are adopted
in a progressive manner to enable the coarse-to-fine restoration. Experiments
show that our proposed method can achieve plausible performance in both
quantitative and qualitative evaluation, and more importantly, can generate
realistic and promising results on real degraded images without requiring an
identity-belonging reference. The source code and models are available at

crystal symmetry is broken, and the associated corner states are disappeared.
It is well known that the emergence of robust edge states and quantized
transport can be induced by adding sufficient disorders into a topologically
trivial insulator, that is the so-called topological Anderson insulator. The
question is whether disorders can also cause the higher-order topological
phase. This is not known so far, because interactions between disorders and the
higher-order topological phases are completely different from those with the
first-order topological system. Here, we demonstrate theoretically that the
disorderinduced higher-order topological corner state and quantized fraction
corner charge can appear in a modified Haldane model. In experiments, we
construct the classical analog of such higherorder topological Anderson
insulators using electric circuits and observe the disorder-induced corner
state through the voltage measurement. Our work defies the conventional view
that the disorder is detrimental to the higher-order topological phase, and
offers a feasible platform to investigate the interaction between disorders and

problems in computer science. The first basic problem in the analysis of

problem is to consider concentration bounds, i.e. showing that large deviations
from the mean have small probability. Similarly, in the context of
probabilistic programs and randomized algorithms, the analysis of expected
termination time/running time and their concentration bounds are fundamental
problems.In this work, we focus on concentration bounds for probabilistic
programs and probabilistic recurrences of randomized algorithms. For
probabilistic programs, the basic technique to achieve concentration bounds is
to consider martingales and apply the classical Azuma's inequality. For
probabilistic recurrences of randomized algorithms, Karp's classical ""cookbook""
method, which is similar to the master theorem for recurrences, is the standard
approach to obtain concentration bounds. In this work, we propose a novel
approach for deriving concentration bounds for probabilistic programs and
probabilistic recurrence relations through the synthesis of exponential
supermartingales. For probabilistic programs, we present algorithms for
synthesis of such supermartingales in several cases. We also show that our
approach can derive better concentration bounds than simply applying the
classical Azuma's inequality over various probabilistic programs considered in
the literature. For probabilistic recurrences, our approach can derive tighter
bounds than the Karp's well-established methods on classical algorithms.
Moreover, we show that our approach could derive bounds comparable to the
optimal bound for quicksort, proposed by McDiarmid and Hayward. We also present

algebraic curves in mini-twistor space, known as spectral curves, which are in
turn in correspondence with rational maps between Riemann spheres. Hyperbolic
monopoles correspond to circle-invariant Yang-Mills instantons, with an
identification of the monopole and instanton numbers, providing the curvature
of hyperbolic space is tuned to a value specified by the asymptotic magnitude
of the Higgs field. In previous work, constraints on ADHM instanton data have
been identified that provide a non-canonical realization of the circle symmetry
that preserves the standard action of rotations in the ball model of hyperbolic
space. Here formulae are presented for the spectral curve and the rational map
of a hyperbolic monopole in terms of its constrained ADHM matrix. This extends
earlier results that apply only to the subclass of instantons of JNR type. The
formulae are applied to obtain new explicit examples of spectral curves that
are beyond the JNR class.

using as a proxy solar background magnetic field and detection of grand solar
cycles of about 400 years separated by grand solar minima (GSMs).The previous
GSM known as the Maunder minimum was recorded from 1645 to 1715. The
terrestrial temperature during Maunder Minimum was reduced by up to 1.0C that
led to freezing rivers, cold winters and summers. The modern GSM started in
2020 and will last for three solar cycles until 2053. During this GSM two
processes will affect the input of solar radiation: a decrease of solar
activity and an increase in total solar irradiance because of solar inertial
motion (SIM). For evaluation of the latter this study uses daily ephemeris of
the Sun-Earth (SE) distances in two millennia from 600 to 2600 showing
significant decreases of SE distances in the first 6 months of a year by 0.005
au in 600 to 1600 and by more than 0.01 au in 1600 to 2600 with consequent
increases of SE distances in the second halves of a year. Although, these
increases are not fully symmetric in the second millennium (1600 to 2600),
during which the longest SE distances are gradually shifted from 21 June to 15
July in 2600 while the shortest ones from 21 December to 15 January. These
distance variations impose significant increases of solar irradiance in the
first six months of each year in the two millennia, which are not fully offset
by the solar radiation decreases in the last six months in millennium 1600 to
2600. This misbalance creates an annual surplus of solar radiation to be
processed by the terrestrial atmosphere and ocean environments that can lead to
an increase of terrestrial temperature. We estimate that decrease of solar
activity during GSM combined with its increase imposed by SIM will lead to a
reduction of terrestrial temperature during the modern GSM to the levels of
1700.

of architectured materials can be precisely designed by tailoring
microstructures. As one of the primary design objectives, the elastic isotropy
is of great significance for many engineering applications. However, the
prevailing experimental and numerical methods are normally too costly and
time-consuming to determine the elastic isotropy of architectured materials
with tens of thousands of possible microstructures in design space. The quick
mechanical characterization is thus desired for the advanced design of
architectured materials. Here, a deep learning-based approach is developed as a
portable and efficient tool to identify the elastic isotropy of architectured
materials directly from the images of their representative microstructures with
arbitrary component distributions. The measure of elastic isotropy for
architectured materials is derived firstly in this paper to construct a
database with associated images of microstructures. Then a convolutional neural
network is trained with the database. It is found that the convolutional neural
network shows good performance on the isotropy identification. Meanwhile, it
exhibits enough robustness to maintain the performance under fluctuated
material properties in practical fabrications. Moreover, the well-trained
convolutional neural network can be successfully transferred among different
types of architectured materials, including two-phase composites and porous
materials, which greatly enhance the efficiency of the deep learning-based
approach. This study can give new inspirations on the fast mechanical
characterization for the big-data driven design of architectured materials.

  Locality and Globality","version preprint IJF",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Forecasting groups of time series is of increasing practical importance, e.g.
forecasting the demand for multiple products offered by a retailer or server
loads within a data center. The local approach to this problem considers each
time series separately and fits a function or model to each series. The global
approach fits a single function to all series. For groups of similar time
series, global methods outperform the more established local methods. However,
recent results show good performance of global models even in heterogeneous
datasets. This suggests a more general applicability of global methods,
potentially leading to more accurate tools and new scenarios to study.
  Formalizing the setting of forecasting a set of time series with local and
global methods, we provide the following contributions:
  1) Global methods are not more restrictive than local methods, both can
produce the same forecasts without any assumptions about similarity of the
series. Global models can succeed in a wider range of problems than previously
thought.
  2) Basic generalization bounds for local and global algorithms. The
complexity of local methods grows with the size of the set while it remains
constant for global methods. In large datasets, a global algorithm can afford
to be quite complex and still benefit from better generalization. These bounds
serve to clarify and support recent experimental results in the field, and
guide the design of new algorithms. For the class of autoregressive models,
this implies that global models can have much larger memory than local methods.
  3) In an extensive empirical study, purposely naive algorithms derived from
these principles, such as global linear models or deep networks result in
superior accuracy.
  In particular, global linear models can provide competitive accuracy with two
orders of magnitude fewer parameters than local methods.

initial spread rate often fail to predict the true scale of that epidemic. Most
epidemics with a rapid early rise die out before affecting a significant
fraction of the population, whereas the early pace of some pandemics is rather
modest. Recent models suggest that this could be due to the heterogeneity of
the target population's susceptibility. We study a computer malware ecosystem
exhibiting spread mechanisms resembling those of biological systems while
offering details unavailable for human epidemics. Rather than comparing models,
we directly estimate reach from a new and vastly more complete data from a
parallel domain, that offers superior details and insight as concerns
biological outbreaks. We find a highly heterogeneous distribution of computer
susceptibilities, with nearly all outbreaks initially over-affecting the tail
of the distribution, then collapsing quickly once this tail is depleted. This
mechanism restricts the correlation between an epidemic's initial growth rate
and its total reach, thus preventing the majority of epidemics, including
initially fast-growing outbreaks, from reaching a macroscopic fraction of the
population. The few pervasive malwares distinguish themselves early on via the
following key trait: they avoid infecting the tail, while preferentially
targeting computers unaffected by typical malware.

algorithm which seeks to decompose the RCS approximately inside the LM

we propose to relax it into a chance constrained problem and solve it through

about physical properties of objects and to foresee their dynamics under the
effect of applied forces. In order to scale learning through interaction to
many objects and scenes, robots should be able to improve their own performance
from real-world experience without requiring human supervision. To this end, we
propose a novel approach for modeling the dynamics of a robot's interactions
directly from unlabeled 3D point clouds and images. Unlike previous approaches,
our method does not require ground-truth data associations provided by a
tracker or any pre-trained perception network. To learn from unlabeled
real-world interaction data, we enforce consistency of estimated 3D clouds,
actions and 2D images with observed ones. Our joint forward and inverse network
learns to segment a scene into salient object parts and predicts their 3D
motion under the effect of applied actions. Moreover, our object-centric model
outputs action-conditioned 3D scene flow, object masks and 2D optical flow as
emergent properties. Our extensive evaluation both in simulation and with
real-world data demonstrates that our formulation leads to effective,
interpretable models that can be used for visuomotor control and planning.

simplicity can be found for a wide range of models from spin glasses to
k-regular maximum cut problems. Many optical, photonic, and electronic systems
are neuromorphic architectures that can naturally operate to optimise problems
satisfying this criterion and, therefore, such problems are often chosen to
illustrate the computational advantages of new Ising machines. We further probe
an intermediate complexity for sparse and dense models by analysing circulant
coupling matrices, that can be `rewired' to introduce greater complexity. A
compelling approach for distinguishing easy and hard instances within the same
NP-hard class of problems can be a starting point in developing a standardised

accumulating inventory in the foreign currency. Historical examples of failed
target zones illustrate that this inventory can become problematic, in

this situation through a continuous-time market impact model of
Almgren--Chriss-type with drift, in which the exchange rate is a diffusion
process controlled by the price impact of the central bank's intervention
strategy. The objective of the central bank is to enforce the target zone
through a strategy that minimizes the accumulated inventory. We formulate this
objective as a stochastic control problem with random time horizon. It is
solved by reduction to a singular boundary value problem that was solved by
Lasry and Lions (1989). Finally, we provide numerical simulations of optimally

characterizes the population heterogeneity. We show that our generalized model
is as simple as the original model which is contained as a limiting case.
Because of this simplicity, numerical solutions can be generated easily and key
properties of the epidemic wave can still be obtained exactly. In particular,
we present exact expressions for the herd immunity level, the final size of the
epidemic, as well as for the shape of the wave and for observables that can be
quantified during an epidemic. We find that in strongly heterogeneous
populations the epidemic reaches only a small fraction of the population. This
implies that the herd immunity level can be much lower than in commonly used
models with homogeneous populations. Using our model to analyze data for the
SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Germany shows that the reported time course is
consistent with several scenarios characterized by different levels of
immunity. These scenarios differ in population heterogeneity and in the time
course of the infection rate, for example due to mitigation efforts or
seasonality. Our analysis reveals that quantifying the effects of mitigation
requires knowledge on the degree of heterogeneity in the population. Our work
shows that key effects of population heterogeneity can be captured without
increasing the complexity of the model. We show that information about
population heterogeneity will be key to understand how far an epidemic has

stable and unstable matter waves is analyzed, revealing among others the
coherent evolution of magnetic dark-bright, nematic dark-bright-bright and
dark-dark-dark solitons. Moreover, for the unstable cases unmagnetized or
magnetic droplet-like configurations and spin-waves consisting of regular and
magnetic solitons are seen to dynamically emerge remaining thereafter robust

identify two wave modes, namely, a surface plasmon and a diffusive mode. In the
presence of an external static magnetic field, the diffusive mode combines the
features of both the conventional and Hall diffusion and may exhibit a negative
group velocity. In our analysis, we solve exactly a boundary value problem for
the time-harmonic Maxwell equations coupled with linearized hydrodynamic
equations for the flat, two-dimensional material. By numerically evaluating the
integrals for the electromagnetic field on the sheet, we find that the plasmon
contribution dominates in the intermediate-field region of the dipole source.
In contrast, the amplitude of the diffusive mode reaches its maximum value in
the near-field region, and quickly decays with the distance from the source. We
demonstrate that the diffusive mode can be distinguished from the plasmon in

segmentation. Recently, non-local self-attention based methods are proved to be
effective for context information collection. Since the desired context
consists of spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions, 3D representation is an
appropriate formulation. However, these non-local methods describe 3D context
information based on a 2D similarity matrix, where space compression may lead
to channel-wise attention missing. An alternative is to model the contextual
information directly without compression. However, this effort confronts a
fundamental difficulty, namely the high-rank property of context information.
In this paper, we propose a new approach to model the 3D context
representations, which not only avoids the space compression but also tackles
the high-rank difficulty. Here, inspired by tensor canonical-polyadic
decomposition theory (i.e, a high-rank tensor can be expressed as a combination
of rank-1 tensors.), we design a low-rank-to-high-rank context reconstruction
framework (i.e, RecoNet). Specifically, we first introduce the tensor
generation module (TGM), which generates a number of rank-1 tensors to capture
fragments of context feature. Then we use these rank-1 tensors to recover the
high-rank context features through our proposed tensor reconstruction module
(TRM). Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art on
various public datasets. Additionally, our proposed method has more than 100
times less computational cost compared with conventional non-local-based

stabilities of the three branches of the RNAdS black holes are determined by
the underlying free energy landscape topography. We suggest that the large
(small) RNAdS black hole can have the probability to switch to the small
(large) black hole due to the thermal fluctuation. Such a state switching
process under the thermal fluctuation is taken as a stochastic process and the
associated kinetics can be described by the probabilistic Fokker-Planck
equation. We obtained the time dependent solutions for the probabilistic
evolution by numerically solving Fokker-Planck equation with the reflecting
boundary conditions. We also investigated the first passage process which
describes how fast a system undergoes a stochastic process for the first time.
The distributions of the first passage time switching from small (large) to
large (small) black hole and the corresponding mean first passage time as well
as its fluctuations at different temperatures are studied in detail. We
conclude that the mean first passage time and its fluctuations are related to
the free energy landscape topography through barrier heights and temperatures.

enhanced as disorder approaches the transition but decreases sharply in the

to the disorder strength: for intermediate disorders below the transition, we
already observe a highly asymmetric distribution with an exponential tail.
Around the transition, it is well described by a log-normal distribution and a
parabolic singularity spectrum. These features are typical of a multifractal
measure. We determine quantitatively the critical disorder at which the
insulator transition occurs by an analysis of level statistics in the spectral
region that contributes to the formation of the order parameter. Interestingly,
spectral correlations at the transition are similar to those found in
non-interacting disordered systems at the Anderson transition. A percolation

compression. It boosts the performance of a miniaturized student network with
the supervision of the output distribution and feature maps from a
sophisticated teacher network. Some recent works introduce multi-teacher
distillation to provide more supervision to the student network. However, the
effectiveness of multi-teacher distillation methods are accompanied by costly
computation resources. To tackle with both the efficiency and the effectiveness
of knowledge distillation, we introduce the feature aggregation to imitate the
multi-teacher distillation in the single-teacher distillation framework by
extracting informative supervision from multiple teacher feature maps.
Specifically, we introduce DFA, a two-stage Differentiable Feature Aggregation
search method that motivated by DARTS in neural architecture search, to
efficiently find the aggregations. In the first stage, DFA formulates the
searching problem as a bi-level optimization and leverages a novel bridge loss,
which consists of a student-to-teacher path and a teacher-to-student path, to
find appropriate feature aggregations. The two paths act as two players against
each other, trying to optimize the unified architecture parameters to the
opposite directions while guaranteeing both expressivity and learnability of
the feature aggregation simultaneously. In the second stage, DFA performs
knowledge distillation with the derived feature aggregation. Experimental
results show that DFA outperforms existing methods on CIFAR-100 and CINIC-10

average treatment effect (ATE) based on the difference of novel double-robust
(DR) estimators of the treatment-specific outcome means. We compare our new
estimator with previously estimators both theoretically and via simulation.
DR-difference estimators may have poor finite sample behavior when the
estimated propensity scores in the treated and untreated do not overlap. We
therefore propose an alternative approach, which can be used even in this
unfavorable setting, based on locally efficient double-robust estimation of a
semiparametric regression model for the modification on an additive scale of
the magnitude of the treatment effect by the baseline covariates $X$. In
contrast with existing methods, our approach simultaneously provides estimates
of: i) the average treatment effect in the total study population, ii) the
average treatment effect in the random subset of the population with
overlapping estimated propensity scores, and iii) the treatment effect at each
level of the baseline covariates $X$.
  When the covariate vector $X$ is high dimensional, one cannot be certain,
owing to lack of power, that given models for the propensity score and for the
regression of the outcome on treatment and $X$ used in constructing our DR
estimators are nearly correct, even if they pass standard goodness of fit
tests. Therefore to select among candidate models, we propose a novel approach
to model selection that leverages the DR-nature of our treatment effect
estimator and that outperforms cross-validation in a small simulation study.

propose a new FL framework with sparsification-amplified privacy. Our approach
integrates random sparsification with gradient perturbation on each agent to
amplify privacy guarantee. Since sparsification would increase the number of
communication rounds required to achieve a certain target accuracy, which is
unfavorable for DP guarantee, we further introduce acceleration techniques to
help reduce the privacy cost. We rigorously analyze the convergence of our
approach and utilize Renyi DP to tightly account the end-to-end DP guarantee.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that our approach

of time-dependent multivariate data, for which dimensionality reduction (DR)
methods are often used to uncover the intrinsic structure and features of the
data. However, DR is usually applied to a subset of data that is either
single-time-point multivariate or univariate time-series, resulting in the need
to manually examine and correlate the DR results out of different data subsets.
When the number of dimensions is large either in terms of the number of time
points or attributes, this manual task becomes too tedious and infeasible. In
this paper, we present MulTiDR, a new DR framework that enables processing of
time-dependent multivariate data as a whole to provide a comprehensive overview
of the data. With the framework, we employ DR in two steps. When treating the
instances, time points, and attributes of the data as a 3D array, the first DR
step reduces the three axes of the array to two, and the second DR step
visualizes the data in a lower-dimensional space. In addition, by coupling with
a contrastive learning method and interactive visualizations, our framework
enhances analysts' ability to interpret DR results. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our framework with four case studies using real-world
datasets.

stock index prices, can be used to produce mood indicators -- in terms of
pessimism and optimism -- at country level. We analyse the ""very high human

different clusters of countries and markets in terms of pessimism and optimism.
Moreover, specific regimes along the time emerge, with an increasing optimism
spreading during the mid of June 2020. Furthermore, countries with different
government responses to the pandemic have experienced different levels of mood
indicators, so that countries with less strict lockdown had a higher level of

  arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1904.01892",,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We propose a novel deep visual odometry (VO) method that considers global

methods take the VO task as a pure tracking problem via recovering camera poses
from image snippets, leading to severe error accumulation. Global information
is crucial for alleviating accumulated errors. However, it is challenging to
effectively preserve such information for end-to-end systems. To deal with this
challenge, we design an adaptive memory module, which progressively and
adaptively saves the information from local to global in a neural analogue of
memory, enabling our system to process long-term dependency. Benefiting from
global information in the memory, previous results are further refined by an
additional refining module. With the guidance of previous outputs, we adopt a
spatial-temporal attention to select features for each view based on the
co-visibility in feature domain. Specifically, our architecture consisting of
Tracking, Remembering and Refining modules works beyond tracking. Experiments
on the KITTI and TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by large margins and produces competitive results

outstanding performance in challenging scenarios such as texture-less regions

the subsequent selection of the phenotype. The full enumeration of a given
genotype-phenotype (GP) map is therefore a powerful technique in examining
evolutionary landscapes. However, because the number of genotypes typically
grows exponentially with genome length, such calculations rapidly become
intractable. Here I apply graphics processing unit(GPU) techniques to the
hydrophobic-polar (HP)model for protein folding. This GP map is a simple and
well-studied model for the complex process of protein folding. Prior studies on
relatively small 2D and 3D lattices have been exclusively carried out using
conventional central processing unit (CPU) approaches. By using GPU techniques,
I was able to reproduce the pioneering calculations of Li et al.[1] with a
speed up of 580-700 fold over a CPU. I was also able to perform the largest
enumeration to date of the 6x6 lattice. These novel calculations provide
evidence that a popular ""plum-pudding"" metaphor that suggests that phenotypes
are disconnected in genotype space does not describe the data. Instead a
""spaghetti"" metaphor of connected genotype networks may be more suitable.
Furthermore, the data allows the relationships between designability and
complexity within GP space to be explored. GPU approaches appear extremely well
suited toGP mapping and the success of this work provides a promising
introduction for its wider application in this field.

investigate the reasons of the case fatality rate (CFR) differences across
Italian 20 regions and 107 provinces, using a multivariate OLS regression
approach; and ii) second, to build a taxonomy of provinces with similar
mortality risk of COVID-19, by using the Ward hierarchical agglomerative
clustering method. I considered health system metrics, environmental pollution,
climatic conditions, demographic variables, and three ad hoc indexes that
represent the health system saturation. The results showed that overall health
care efficiency, physician density, and average temperature helped to reduce
the CFR. By the contrary, population aged 70 and above, car and firm density,
level of air pollutants (NO2, O3, PM10, and PM2.5), relative average humidity,
COVID-19 prevalence, and all three indexes of health system saturation were
positively associated with the CFR. Population density, social vertical
integration, and altitude were not statistically significant. In particular,
the risk of dying increases with age, as 90 years old and above had a
three-fold greater risk than the 80 to 89 years old and four-fold greater risk
than 70 to 79 years old. Moreover, the cluster analysis showed that the highest
mortality risk was concentrated in the north of the country, while the lowest
risk was associated with southern provinces. Finally, since prevalence and
health system saturation indexes played the most important role in explaining
the CFR variability, a significant part of the latter may have been caused by
the massive stress of the Italian health system.

consideration of temporal information, the image saliency deep models may
become fragile in the video sequences dominated by temporal information. Thus,
the most recent video saliency detection approaches have adopted the network
architecture starting with a spatial deep model that is followed by an

encounter the performance bottleneck arising from the single stream learning
methodology, so the overall detection performance is largely determined by the
spatial deep model. In sharp contrast to the current mainstream methods, this
paper proposes a novel plug-and-play scheme to weakly retrain a pretrained

"2009.06359","Jinfeng Huang","Jin Feng Huang","The solitary wave in advanced nuclear energy system","22 pages, 6 figures",,,,"nlin.PS nucl-th physics.plasm-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The solitary wave naturally arises in many areas of mathematical physics,
including in nonlinear optics, plasma physics, quantum field theory, and fluid
mechanics. In the past few years, for an advanced nuclear energy system, a
particular class of traveling wave reactor called the Constant Axial shape of
Neutron flux, nuclide number densities and power shape During Life of Energy
production (CANDLE) reactor has been proposed, and an analytical solution has
been desired since it could reveal the global characters of the solution. In
this study, from the perspective of the solitary wave, the analytical solution
of this advanced nuclear energy system is demonstrated through coupling the
one-group neutron diffusion equation with the burnup equation. The
tanh-function method is applied to solve that nonlinear partial differential
equation. The relationship between the velocity of the solitary wave, wave
amplitude, or neutron flux and the evolution of the nuclide is revealed by the
analytical method. The results demonstrate that the neutron flux is
proportional to the wave velocity. The results also imply that the amplitude of
the neutron flux is proportional to the square root of the diffusion
coefficient but is inversely proportional to the initial 238U density.
