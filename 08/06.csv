each with nonlinear medium response. The equations are generally referred to as
""Newell-Whitehead-Segel equation,"" which model a wide variety of nonlinear
physical, mechanical and biological systems. Nonlinear medium response can be
viewed in many perspectives, such as, memory response from the medium, whereby,
the medium ""remembers"" earlier influences; reactive responses, whereby, the
medium is actively responsive to input, such as, chemical reactivity,
turbulence and many other circumstances; these equations arise often in the
biological sciences when modeling population dynamics, whether the population
be genomic, such as, alleles, or animal species in the environment; finally,
these sets of equations are often employed to model neurological responses from
excitable cellular media. The solutions provided are of a very general nature,
indeed, whereby, a canonical set of solutions are given for a class of
nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations with nonlinear medium
response expressed as either a p-times iterative convolution or p-times
multiplicative response. The advantage of canonical solution sets are these
solutions involve classic representative forms, such as, Green's function or
Green's heat kernel and aid researchers in further complication, analysis and
understanding of the systemic behavior of these types of nonlinear systems.

inertia-gravity waves (IGWs) often coexist with a geostrophically balanced
turbulent flow. Advection and refraction by this flow lead to wave scattering,
redistributing IGW energy in the position--wavenumber phase space. We give a
detailed description of this process by deriving a kinetic equation governing
the evolution of the IGW phase-space energy density. The derivation relies on
the smallness of the Rossby number characterising the geostrophic flow, which
is treated as a random field with known statistics, and makes no assumption of
spatial scale separation.
  The kinetic equation describes energy transfers that are restricted to IGWs
with the same frequency, as a result of the timescale separation between waves
and flow. We formulate the kinetic equation on the constant-frequency surface
-- a double cone in wavenumber space -- using polar spherical coordinates, and
we examine the form of the two scattering cross sections involved, which
quantify energy transfers between IGWs with, respectively, the same and
opposite directions of vertical propagation. The kinetic equation captures both
the horizontal isotropisation and the cascade of energy across scales that
result from scattering. We focus our attention on the latter to assess the
predictions of the kinetic equation against direct simulations of the
three-dimensional Boussinesq equations, finding good agreement.

However, it would be controversial to suggest a general guideline to construct
an optimal time partition. While a great deal of research has been done to
relax the assumption of the fixed split times for other non-parametric

this paper, we propose a new Bayesian framework for proportional hazards models

their posterior distributions.

on the electron spin resonance (ESR) properties of CrCl3 and CrI3 single
crystals upon photo-excitation in the visible range. We noticed remarkable
changes in the ESR spectra upon illumination. In the case of CrCl3, at 10 K,
the ESR signal is shifted from g = 1.492 (dark) to 1.661 (light), line width
increased from 376 to 506 Oe, and the signal intensity is reduced by 1.5 times.
Most interestingly, the observed change in the signal intensity is reversible
when the light is cycled on/off. We observed almost no change in the ESR
spectral parameters in the paramagnetic phase (>20 K) upon illumination. Upon
photo-excitation of CrI3, the ESR signal intensity is reduced by 1.9 times; the
g-value increased from 1.956 to 1.990; the linewidth increased from 1170 to
1260 Oe at 60 K. These findings are discussed by taking into account the skin
depth, the slow relaxation mechanism and the appearance of low-symmetry fields
at the photo-generated Cr2+ Jahn-Teller centers. Such an increase in the
g-value as a result of photo-generated Cr2+ ions is further supported by our

in signal processing, manufacturing processes, healthcare, among others. As one
of the most popular methods in tensor literature, Robust tensor principal
component analysis (RTPCA) is a very effective tool to extract the low rank and
sparse components in tensors. In this paper, a new method to analyze RTPCA is
proposed based on the recently developed tensor-tensor product and tensor
singular value decomposition (t-SVD). Specifically, it aims to solve a convex
optimization problem whose objective function is a weighted combination of the
tensor nuclear norm and the l1-norm. In most of literature of RTPCA, the exact
recovery is built on the tensor incoherence conditions and the assumption of a
uniform model on the sparse support. Unlike this conventional way, in this
paper, without any assumption of randomness, the exact recovery can be achieved
in a completely deterministic fashion by characterizing the tensor
rank-sparsity incoherence, which is an uncertainty principle between the
low-rank tensor spaces and the pattern of sparse tensor.

mechanism that would be less likely to occur in a high-density environment like
Virgo. We combine emission line observations with deep optical images to
investigate the origin of the peculiar metallicity gradient. The presence of
weak underlying substructures in both galaxies and the analysis of

spend in atrial fibrillation (AF) over a long enough monitoring period. Recent
research has demonstrated the added prognosis value that becomes available by
using the AFB as compared with the binary diagnosis. We evaluate, for the first
time, the ability to estimate the AFB over long-term continuous recordings,
using a deep recurrent neutral network (DRNN) approach. Methods: The models
were developed and evaluated on a large database of p=2,891 patients, totaling
t=68,800 hours of continuous electrocardiography (ECG) recordings acquired at
the University of Virginia heart station. Specifically, 24h beat-to-beat time
series were obtained from a single portable ECG channel. The network, denoted
ArNet, was benchmarked against a gradient boosting (XGB) model, trained on 21
features including the coefficient of sample entropy (CosEn) and AFEvidence.
Data were divided into training and test sets, while patients were stratified
by the presence and severity of AF. The generalizations of ArNet and XGB were
also evaluated on the independent test PhysioNet LTAF database. Results: the
absolute AF burden estimation error |E_AF|, median and interquartile, on the
test set, was 1.2 (0.1-6.7) for ArNet and 3.1 (0.0-11.7) for XGB for AF
individuals. Generalization results on LTAF were consistent with E_AF of 2.6
(1.1-14.7) for ArNet and 3.6 (1.0-16.7) for XGB. Conclusion: This research
demonstrates the feasibility of AFB estimation from 24h beat-to-beat interval
time series utilizing recent advances in DRNN. Significance: The novel
data-driven approach enables robust remote diagnosis and phenotyping of AF.

well-established numerical simulations already available to the FEL community.
The approach is not based on the period average approximation and can handle
long-wavelength waveguide FELs as it is possible to include the dispersion
effects of the boundaries. Futhermore, it correctly simulates lower charge
systems where both transverse and longitudinal space charge forces still play a
significant role in the dynamics. For free-space FEL interactions, a source
dependent expansion approximation can be used to limit the number of transverse
modes required to model the field profile and speed up the calculation of the
system evolution. Three examples are studied in detail including a single pass

the United States. To fill this gap, we construct a comprehensive, nationwide
database of 2,138 geocoded ISP offices that offer low- or no-cost legal
services to low-income immigrants. We use spatial optimization methods to
analyze the geographic network of ISPs and measure ISPs' proximity to the

concentrated in major urban areas, most low-income immigrants live close to an
ISP. However, we also find a sizable fraction of low-income immigrants in
underserved areas, which are primarily in midsize cities in the South. This
reflects both a general skew in non-governmental organization service provision

from placing new ISPs in underserved areas to maximize the number of low-income
immigrants who live near an ISP. Overall, our results provide vital information

Content Aware Rectification using Angle Supervision","Presented in ECCV 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The ubiquity of smartphone cameras has led to more and more documents being

documents are often folded and crumpled, resulting in large local variance in
text structure. The problem of document rectification is fundamental to the
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process on documents, and its ability to
overcome geometric distortions significantly affects recognition accuracy.
Despite the great progress in recent OCR systems, most still rely on a
pre-process that ensures the text lines are straight and axis aligned. Recent
works have tackled the problem of rectifying document images taken in-the-wild
using various supervision signals and alignment means. However, they focused on
global features that can be extracted from the document's boundaries, ignoring
various signals that could be obtained from the document's content.
  We present CREASE: Content Aware Rectification using Angle Supervision, the
first learned method for document rectification that relies on the document's
content, the location of the words and specifically their orientation, as hints
to assist in the rectification process. We utilize a novel pixel-wise angle
regression approach and a curvature estimation side-task for optimizing our
rectification model. Our method surpasses previous approaches in terms of OCR
accuracy, geometric error and visual similarity.

around the Fermi level and strong $p-d$ hybridization. In contrast,

it enhances the $p-d$ hybridization, and it produces low-spin (S=0,

  First, we prove a strong and quantitative form of the confluence of geodesics
phenomenon which states that any pair of geodesics which are sufficiently close

endpoints.
  Then, we show that the intersection of any two geodesics minus their
endpoints is connected, the number of geodesics which emanate from a single
point and are disjoint except at their starting point is at most $5$, and the
maximal number of geodesics which connect any pair of points is $9$. For each
$1\le k \le 9$, we obtain the Hausdorff dimension of the pairs of points
connected by exactly $k$ geodesics. For $k=7,8,9$, such pairs have dimension
zero and are countably infinite. Further, we classify the (finite number of)
possible configurations of geodesics between any pair of points in

this gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture of Angel, Kolesnik, and

drawback of FCS is that it does not invoke an appropriate data augmentation
mechanism and as such convergence of the resulting Markov chain Monte Carlo
procedure is not assured. Methods that use joint modeling lack these drawbacks
but have not been efficiently implemented in data of general structures. We
address these issues by developing a new method, the so-called GERBIL
algorithm, that draws imputations from a latent joint multivariate normal model
that underpins the generally structured data. This model is constructed using a
sequence of flexible conditional linear models that enables the resulting
procedure to be efficiently implemented on high dimensional datasets in
practice. Simulations show that GERBIL performs well when compared to those
that utilize FCS. Furthermore, the new method is computationally efficient

Quantification and localization of different adipose tissue compartments from
whole-body MR images is of high interest to examine metabolic conditions. For
correct identification and phenotyping of individuals at increased risk for
metabolic diseases, a reliable automatic segmentation of adipose tissue into
subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue is required. In this work we propose a
3D convolutional neural network (DCNet) to provide a robust and objective
segmentation. In this retrospective study, we collected 1000 cases (66$\pm$ 13
years; 523 women) from the Tuebingen Family Study and from the German Center
for Diabetes research (TUEF/DZD), as well as 300 cases (53$\pm$ 11 years; 152
women) from the German National Cohort (NAKO) database for model training,
validation, and testing with a transfer learning between the cohorts. These
datasets had variable imaging sequences, imaging contrasts, receiver coil
arrangements, scanners and imaging field strengths. The proposed DCNet was
compared against a comparable 3D UNet segmentation in terms of sensitivity,
specificity, precision, accuracy, and Dice overlap. Results: Fast (5-7seconds)
and reliable adipose tissue segmentation can be obtained with high Dice overlap
(0.94), sensitivity (96.6%), specificity (95.1%), precision (92.1%) and
accuracy (98.4%) from 3D whole-body MR datasets (field of view coverage
450x450x2000mm${}^3$). Segmentation masks and adipose tissue profiles are
automatically reported back to the referring physician. Conclusion: Automatic
adipose tissue segmentation is feasible in 3D whole-body MR data sets and is
generalizable to different epidemiological cohort studies with the proposed
DCNet.

accelerated rates in the non-convex case. Under Lipschitz assumptions on the

approximate first-order critical points faster than regular gradient descent. A
randomized version also finds approximate second-order critical points. Both
the algorithms and their analyses build extensively on existing work in the
Euclidean case. The basic operation consists in running the Euclidean
accelerated gradient descent method (appropriately safe-guarded against
non-convexity) in the current tangent space, then moving back to the manifold
and repeating. This requires lifting the cost function from the manifold to the
tangent space, which can be done for example through the Riemannian exponential
map. For this approach to succeed, the lifted cost function (called the
pullback) must retain certain Lipschitz properties. As a contribution of
independent interest, we prove precise claims to that effect, with explicit
constants. Those claims are affected by the Riemannian curvature of the
manifold, which in turn affects the worst-case complexity bounds for our
optimization algorithms.

relevant to find the best route in traffic and make autonomous robots able to
navigate. The use of path planning presents some issues in large and dynamic
environments. Large environments make these algorithms spend much time finding
the shortest path. On the other hand, dynamic environments request a new
execution of the algorithm each time a change occurs in the environment, and it
increases the execution time. The dimensionality reduction appears as a
solution to this problem, which in this context means removing useless paths
present in those environments. Most of the algorithms that reduce
dimensionality are limited to the linear correlation of the input data.
Recently, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Encoder was used to overcome
this situation since it can use both linear and non-linear information to data
reduction. This paper analyzes in-depth the performance to eliminate the
useless paths using this CNN Encoder model. To measure the mentioned model
efficiency, we combined it with different path planning algorithms. Next, the
final algorithms (combined and not combined) are checked in a database that is
composed of five scenarios. Each scenario contains fixed and dynamic obstacles.
Their proposed model, the CNN Encoder, associated to other existent path
planning algorithms in the literature, was able to obtain a time decrease to
find the shortest path in comparison to all path planning algorithms analyzed.
the average decreased time was 54.43 %.

In this study, two populations of SMIFRs were collected, i.e., SIMFRs

(SIMFR-SW). We defined the SIMFR-SUN (SIMFR-SW) as the SMIFRs that include
(exclude) the counter-streaming suprathermal electrons and stay away from

flux-rope model, 52 SIMFR-SUN and 57 SIMFR-SW events observed by Advanced
Composition Explorer (ACE) from 1998 February to 2011 August were qualified.
Using the approach of relating the measurements to their spatial position
within the flux-ropes, a comparative survey of plasma and composition
characteristics inside the two populations of SIMFRs is presented. Results show
that the two populations of SIMFRs have apparent differences. Compared with
SIMFR-SW, SIMFR-SUN are MC-like, featuring lower central proton density, higher
Vrad, higher low-FIP element abundances, higher and more fluctuate average ion
charge-states and the ion chargestate ratios which are related to the heating
in low corona. In addition, for the ion charge-state distributions inside
SIMFR-SUN, the sunward side is higher than earthward, which might be caused by
the flare heating during eruption. Moreover, both SIMFR-SUN and MCs show
anti-correlation between plasma beta and He/P trend. These characteristics
indicate that SIMFR-SUN and MCs are very likely to have the identical
origination. This study supports the two-source origin of SIMFRs, i.e., the
solar corona and the solar wind.

analyze the asymptotic behavior, as time $t$ tends to infinity, of inertial
continuous dynamics where the damping acts as a closed-loop control. The
function $f: H \to R$ to be minimized (not necessarily convex) enters the
dynamic through it gradient, which is assumed to be Lipschitz continuous on the
bounded subsets of $H$. This gives autonomous dynamical systems with nonlinear
damping and nonlinear driving force. We first consider the case where the
damping term $\partial \phi (\dot{x}(t))$ acts as a closed-loop control of the
velocity. The damping potential $\phi : H \to [0,+\infty)$ is a convex
continuous function which achieves its minimum at the origin. We show the
existence and uniqueness of a global solution to the associated Cauchy problem.
Then, we analyze the asymptotic convergence properties of the generated
trajectories generated. We use techniques from optimization, control theory,
and PDE's: Lyapunov analysis based on the decreasing property of an energy-like
function, quasi-gradient and Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz theory, monotone operator
theory for wave-like equations. Convergence rates are obtained based on the
geometric properties of the data $f$ and $\phi$. When $f$ is strongly convex,
we give general conditions which provide exponential convergence rates. Then,
we extend the results to the case where an additional Hessian-driven damping
enters the dynamic, which reduces the oscillations. Finally, we consider an
inertial system involving jointly the velocity $\dot{x}(t)$ and the gradient
$\nabla f(x(t))$. In addition to its original results, this work surveys the
numerous works devoted in recent years to the interaction between continuous
damped inertial dynamics and numerical algorithms for optimization, with the
emphasis on autonomous systems, closed-loop adaptive procedures, and
convergence rates.

the accuracy and convergence properties of our numerical implementation through

chiral single wall black phosphorus (i.e., phosphorene) nanotubes. We use our
simulations to evaluate the torsional stiffness of a zigzag nanotube ab initio.
Additionally, we observe an insulator-to-metal-like transition in the

$Gaia$ proper motions, we are able to infer the behaviour of the velocity
ellipsoid between $\approx3$ and $\approx30$ kpc from the centre of the Galaxy.
We detect the presence of two distinct components: a dominant non-rotating
halo-like population and a much smaller rotating disc-like population. We
demonstrate that the halo RR Lyrae can be described as a superposition of an
isotropic and radially-biased parts. The radially-biased portion of the halo is
characterised by a high orbital anisotropy $\beta\approx0.9$ and contributes
between 50\% and 80\% of the halo RR Lyrae at $5<R$(kpc)$<25$. In line with
previous studies, we interpret this high-$\beta$ component as the debris cloud
of the ancient massive merger also known as the $Gaia$ Sausage (GS) whose
orbital extrema we constrain. The lightcurve properties of the RR Lyrae support
the kinematic decomposition: the GS stars are more metal-rich and boast higher
fractions of Oosterhoff Type 1 and high amplitude short period (HASP) variables
compared to the isotropic halo component. The metallicity/HASP maps reveal that
the inner 10 kpc of the halo is likely inhabited by the RR Lyrae born in-situ.
The mean azimuthal speed and the velocity dispersion of the disc RR Lyrae out
to $R\approx30$ kpc are consistent with the behaviour of a young and metal-rich

population models, we fit the rest-UV spectra of galaxies in our sample to
estimate age and stellar metallicity which, in turn, determine the ionizing
spectrum. In addition to the median properties of well-defined subsets of our
sample, we derive the ages and stellar metallicities for 30 high-SNR individual
galaxies -- the largest sample of individual galaxies at high redshift with
such measurements. Most galaxies in this high-SNR subsample have stellar
metallicities of $0.001<Z_*<0.004$. We then use Cloudy+BPASS photoionization
models to match observed rest-optical line ratios and infer nebular properties.
Our high-SNR subsample is characterized by a median ionization parameter and
oxygen abundance, respectively, of $\log(U)_{\textrm{med}}=-2.98\pm0.25$ and
$12+\log(\textrm{O/H})_{\textrm{med}}=8.48\pm0.11$. Accordingly, we find that
all galaxies in our sample show evidence for $\alpha$-enhancement. In addition,
based on inferred $\log(U)$ and $12+\log(\textrm{O/H})$ values, we find that
the local relationship between ionization parameter and metallicity applies at
$z\sim2$. Finally, we find that the high-redshift galaxies most offset from the
local excitation sequence in the BPT diagram are the most $\alpha$-enhanced.
This trend suggests that $\alpha$-enhancement resulting in a harder ionizing
spectrum at fixed oxygen abundance is a significant driver of the high-redshift
galaxy offset on the BPT diagram relative to local systems. The ubiquity of
$\alpha$-enhancement among $z\sim2.3$ star-forming galaxies indicates important

Release 2.0. We consider the data's radial distribution, organizing
observations into four data subsets based on angular distance from the Galactic
Center. All data is modeled using both background-subtracted and
background-modeled approaches to account for the particle instrument
background, demonstrating statistical limitations of the currently-available
$\sim$1 Ms of particle background data. A non-detection is reported in the
total data set, allowing us to set an upper-limit on 3.5 keV line flux and
constrain the sterile neutrino dark matter mixing angle. The upper-limit on
sin$^2$(2$\theta$) is $2.58 \times 10^{-11}$ (though systematic uncertainty may
increase this by a factor of $\sim$2), corresponding to the upper-limit on 3.5
keV line flux of $2.34 \times 10^{-7}$ ph s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$. These limits show
consistency with recent constraints and several prior detections.
Non-detections are reported in all radial data subsets, allowing us to
constrain the spatial profile of 3.5 keV line intensity, which does not
conclusively differ from Navarro-Frenk-White predictions. Thus, while offering
heavy constraints, we do not entirely rule out the sterile neutrino dark matter
scenario or the more general decaying dark matter hypothesis for the 3.5 keV
line. We have also used the non-detection of any unidentified emission lines
across our continuum to further constrain the sterile neutrino parameter space.

dynamics of this process, we propose to quantum-simulate the reheating-like
dynamics of a generic cosmological single-field model in an ultracold Bose gas.
In our setup, the excitations on top of an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate play
the role of the particles produced by the decaying inflaton field after
inflation. Expanding spacetime as well as the background oscillating inflaton
field are mimicked in the non-relativistic limit by a time dependence of the
atomic interactions, which can be tuned experimentally via Feshbach resonances.
As we illustrate by means of classical-statistical simulations for the case of
two spatial dimensions, the dynamics of the atomic system exhibits the
characteristic stages of far-from-equilibrium reheating, including the
amplification of fluctuations via parametric instabilities and the subsequent
turbulent transport of energy towards higher momenta. The transport is governed
by a non-thermal fixed point showing universal self-similar time evolution as
well as a transient regime of prescaling with time-dependent scaling exponents.
While the classical-statistical simulations can capture only the earlier stages
of the dynamics for weak couplings, the proposed experiment has the potential
of exploring the evolution up to late times even beyond the weak coupling
regime.

limited set of geometric invariants for a given causal set while also
collecting these geometric invariants for small `perturbations' of the causal
set, a novel method that may also be useful in other areas of spectral
geometry. We show that with a suitably chosen set of geometric invariants, this
new method fully resolves the causal sets we considered. Concretely, we
consider for this purpose perturbations of the original causal set that are
formed by adding one element and a link. We discuss potential applications to

correspondence in two directions. First, beginning with a general disk
integrand dressed with a Koba-Nielsen factor, we demonstrate that exchange
symmetry for the factorization residue of the amplitude forces the integrand to
be expandable on SL(2,R) conformal blocks. Furthermore, positivity constraints
associated with unitarity imply the SL(2,R) blocks must come in linear
combinations for which the Virasoro block emerges at the ""kink"" in the space of
solutions. In other words, Virasoro symmetry arises at the boundary of
consistent factorization. Next, we consider the low energy EFT description,
where unitarity manifests as the EFThedron in which the couplings must live.
The existence of a worldsheet description implies, through the Koba-Nielsen
factor, monodromy relations which impose algebraic identities amongst the EFT
couplings. We demonstrate at finite derivative order that the intersection of
the ""monodromy plane"" and the EFThedron carves out a tiny island for the
couplings, which continues to shrink as the derivative order is increased. At
the eighth derivative order, on a three-dimensional monodromy plane, the
intersection fixes the width of this island to around 1.5$\%$ (of $\zeta(3)$)
and 0.2$\%$ (of $\zeta(5)$) with respect to the super string answer. This leads
us to conjecture that the four-point open superstring amplitude can be
completely determined by the geometry of the intersection of the monodromy
plane and the EFThedron.

solid into black dwarfs while pycnonuclear fusion will slowly process their
composition to iron-56. However, due to the declining electron fraction the
Chandrasekhar limit of these stars will be decreasing and will eventually be
below that of the most massive black dwarfs. As such, isolated dwarf stars with
masses greater than $\sim 1.2 M_\odot$ will collapse in the far future due to
the slow accumulation of iron-56 in their cores. If proton decay does not occur
then this is the ultimate fate of about $10^{21}$ stars, approximately one
percent of all stars in the observable universe. We present calculations of the
internal structure of black dwarfs with iron cores as a model for progenitors.

where the main memory is physically shared across all the GPUs. We eliminate
remote accesses and avoid data replication using an MGPU-TSM system, which
simplifies the memory hierarchy. Our preliminary analysis shows that MGPU-TSM
with 4 GPUs performs, on average, 3.9x? better than the current best performing
multi-GPU configuration for standard application benchmarks.

long-lasting examples of a SN interacting with its circumstellar environment.
The optical light curve plateaued at a nearly constant level for more than five
years, suggesting ongoing shock interaction with an extended and clumpy
circumstellar medium (CSM). Here we present continued observations of the SN
from $\sim 1000-5000$ days post-explosion at all wavelengths, including X-ray,
ultraviolet, near-infrared, and mid-infrared. The UV spectra probe the
pre-explosion mass loss and show evidence for CNO processing. From the
bolometric light curve, we find that the total radiated energy is in excess of
$10^{50}$ erg, the progenitor star's pre-explosion mass-loss rate was $\gtrsim
1 \times 10^{-2}\,{\rm M_{\odot}~ yr}^{-1}$, and the total mass lost shortly
before explosion was $\gtrsim 1\,{\rm M_\odot}$, though the mass lost could
have been considerably larger depending on the efficiency for the conversion of
kinetic energy to radiation. The ultraviolet through near-infrared spectrum is
characterised by two high density components, one with narrow high-ionisation
lines, and one with broader low-ionisation H I, He I, [O I], Mg II, and Fe II
lines. The rich Fe II spectrum is strongly affected by Ly$\alpha$ fluorescence,
consistent with spectral modeling. Both the Balmer and He I lines indicate a
decreasing CSM density during the late interaction period. We find similarities
to SN 1988Z, which shows a comparable change in spectrum at around the same
time during its very slow decline. These results suggest that, at long last,
the shock interaction in SN 2005ip may finally be on the decline.

randomly sampling regular hypergraphs. The resulting model has a new parameter,
$k$, defined as the ratio of the number of terms in the Hamiltonian to the
number of degrees of freedom, with the sparse limit corresponding to the
thermodynamic limit at fixed $k$. We argue that this sparse SYK model recovers
the interesting global physics of ordinary SYK even when $k$ is of order unity.
In particular, at low temperature the model exhibits a gravitational sector
which is maximally chaotic. Our argument proceeds by constructing a path
integral for the sparse model which reproduces the conventional SYK path
integral plus gapped fluctuations. The sparsity of the model permits larger
scale numerical calculations than previously possible, the results of which are
consistent with the path integral analysis. Additionally, we show that the
sparsity of the model considerably reduces the cost of quantum simulation
algorithms. This makes the sparse SYK model the most efficient currently known
route to simulate a holographic model of quantum gravity. We also define and
study a sparse supersymmetric SYK model, with similar conclusions to the
non-supersymmetric case. Looking forward, we argue that the class of models
considered here constitute an interesting and relatively unexplored sparse

enhance the anomalous behavior of water, in particular the value of the

experimentally in the early sixties, has remained elusive to a full explanation
in terms of atomistic models. In this paper, we first introduce a two-site
model of tert-butanol in which the interactions involving hydrogen bonding are
represented by a Stillinger-Weber potential, following the ideas first
introduced by Molinero and Moore, [J. Phys. Chem. B, 113, 4008, (2009)]. Our
model parameters are fit so as to semi-quantitatively reproduce the
experimental densities and vaporization enthalpies of previously proposed
united atom and all atom OPLS models. Water is represented using the
aforementioned potential model introduced by Molinero and Moore, with cross
interaction parameters between water and tert-butanol optimized to yield a
reasonable description of the experimental excess enthalpies and volumes over
the whole composition range of the mixture. We will see that our simple model
is able to reproduce the presence of a maximum in the change of the temperature
of maximum density for very low alcohol mole fractions, followed by a
considerable decrease until the density anomaly itself disappears. We have
correlated this behavior with changes in the local structure of water and
compared it with the results of all-atom simulations of water/tert-butanol

user-inaccessible data into the cache enables KASLR breaks and assists various
Meltdown-type attacks, especially Foreshadow.
  In this paper, we provide a systematic analysis of the root cause of this
prefetching effect. While we confirm the empirical results of previous papers,
we show that the attribution to a prefetching mechanism is fundamentally
incorrect in all previous papers describing or exploiting this effect. In
particular, neither the prefetch instruction nor other user-space instructions
actually prefetch kernel addresses into the cache, leading to incorrect
conclusions and ineffectiveness of proposed defenses. The effect exploited in
all of these papers is, in fact, caused by speculative dereferencing of
user-space registers in the kernel. Hence, mitigation techniques such as KAISER
do not eliminate this leakage as previously believed. Beyond our thorough
analysis of these previous works, we also demonstrate new attacks enabled by
understanding the root cause, namely an address-translation attack in more
restricted contexts, direct leakage of register values in certain scenarios,
and the first end-to-end Foreshadow (L1TF) exploit targeting non-L1 data. The
latter is effective even with the recommended Foreshadow mitigations enabled
and thus revives the Foreshadow attack. We demonstrate that these dereferencing
effects exist even on the most recent Intel CPUs with the latest hardware
mitigations, and on CPUs previously believed to be unaffected, i.e., ARM, IBM,

metaphors. Metaphors can present an agent as akin to a wry teenager, a toddler,
or an experienced butler. How might a choice of metaphor influence our
experience of the AI agent? Sampling metaphors along the dimensions of warmth
and competence---defined by psychological theories as the primary axes of
variation for human social perception---we perform a study (N=260) where we
manipulate the metaphor, but not the behavior, of a Wizard-of-Oz conversational
agent. Following the experience, participants are surveyed about their
intention to use the agent, their desire to cooperate with the agent, and the
agent's usability. Contrary to the current tendency of designers to use high
competence metaphors to describe AI products, we find that metaphors that
signal low competence lead to better evaluations of the agent than metaphors
that signal high competence. This effect persists despite both high and low
competence agents featuring human-level performance and the wizards being blind
to condition. A second study confirms that intention to adopt decreases rapidly
as competence projected by the metaphor increases. In a third study, we assess
effects of metaphor choices on potential users' desire to try out the system
and find that users are drawn to systems that project higher competence and
warmth. These results suggest that projecting competence may help attract new
users, but those users may discard the agent unless it can quickly correct with
a lower competence metaphor. We close with a retrospective analysis that finds
similar patterns between metaphors and user attitudes towards past
conversational agents such as Xiaoice, Replika, Woebot, Mitsuku, and Tay.

K, forming an electronic nematic phase with two 90$^\circ$ rotated (twinned)
domains, and orders antiferromagnetically below $T_N\approx 42$ K. We use
inelastic neutron scattering to study spin waves in uniaxial pressure-detwinned
NaFeAs. By comparing the data with combined density functional theory and
dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we conclude that spin waves up to an
energy scale of $E_\text{crossover} \approx 100$ meV are dominated by
$d_{yz}$-$d_{yz}$ intra-orbital scattering processes, which have the two-fold
($C_2$) rotational symmetry of the underlying lattice. On the other hand, the
spin wave excitations above $E_\text{crossover}$, which have approximately
fourfold ($C_4$) rotational symmetry, arise from the $d_{xy}$-$d_{xy}$
intra-orbital scattering that controls the overall magnetic bandwidth in this
material. In addition, we find that the low-energy ($E\approx 6$ meV) spin
excitations change from approximate $C_4$ to $C_2$ rotational symmetry below a
temperature $T^\ast$ ($>T_s$), while spin excitations at energies above
$E_\text{crossover}$ have approximate $C_4$ rotational symmetry and are weakly
temperature dependent. These results are consistent with angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy measurements, where the presence of an uniaxial
strain necessary to detwin NaFeAs also raises the onset temperature $T^\ast$ of
observable orbital-dependent band splitting to above $T_s$, thus supporting the
notion of orbital selective spin waves in the nematic phase of iron-based

for use when single ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding
whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot is taken after each ballot
draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop
(round-by-round (R2) audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant
inefficiency when directly applied to real R2 audits. We present the ATHENA
class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule
is at least as efficient as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at
the end of the round. We have open-source software libraries implementing most
of our results.
  We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required, for all state
margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$
stopping probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end
of the round). We present simulation results supporting the 90% stopping
probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the first round.
Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low
margins, when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in
selection order. This implies that keeping track of the order when drawing
ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient even without
information on selection order. These results are significant because current
approaches to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules,
requiring about twice as much work on the part of election officials. Applying
the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots, but keeping track of the
order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.

ubiquitous class of objects in human life. In this letter, we propose a novel
method for robots to ""imagine"" the open containability affordance of a
previously unseen object via physical simulations. We implement our imagination
method on a UR5 manipulator. The robot autonomously scans the object with an
RGB-D camera. The scanned 3D model is used for open containability imagination
which quantifies the open containability affordance by physically simulating
dropping particles onto the object and counting how many particles are retained
in it. This quantification is used for open-container vs. non-open-container
binary classification (hereafter referred to as open container classification).
If the object is classified as an open container, the robot further imagines
pouring into the object, again using physical simulations, to obtain the
pouring position and orientation for real robot autonomous pouring. We evaluate
our method on open container classification and autonomous pouring of granular
material on a dataset containing 130 previously unseen objects with 57 object
categories. Although our proposed method uses only 11 objects for simulation
calibration (training), its open container classification aligns well with
human judgements. In addition, our method endows the robot with the capability
to autonomously pour into the 55 containers in the dataset with a very high
success rate. We also compare to a deep learning method. Results show that our
method achieves the same performance as the deep learning method on open
container classification and outperforms it on autonomous pouring. Moreover,
our method is fully explainable.

city of Sao Paulo is particularly vulnerable because it is the most populous in
the country. Analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of COVID-19 is important to
help the urgent need to integrate better actions to face the pandemic. Thus,
this study aimed to analyze the COVID-19 mortality, from March to July 2020,
considering the spatio-time architectures, the socio-economic context of the
population, and using a fine granular level, in the most populous city in
Brazil. For this, we conducted an ecological study, using secondary public data
from the mortality information system. We describe mortality rates for each
epidemiological week and the entire period by sex and age. We modelled the
deaths using spatiotemporal and spatial architectures and Poisson probability
distributions in a latent Gaussian Bayesian model approach. We obtained the
relative risks for temporal and spatiotemporal trends and socio-economic
conditions. To reduce possible sub notification, we considered the confirmed
and suspected deaths. Our findings showed an apparent stabilization of the
temporal trend, at the end of the period, but that may change in the future.
Mortality rate increased with increasing age and was higher in men. The risk of
death was greater in areas with the worst social conditions throughout the
study period. However, this was not a uniform pattern over time, since we
identified a shift from the high risk in the areas with best socio-economic
conditions to the worst ones. Our study contributed by emphasizing the
importance of geographic screening in areas with a higher risk of death, and,
currently, worse socio-economic contexts, as a crucial aspect to reducing
disease mortality and health inequities, through integrated public health
actions.

theorists to understand the diversity of climates that may exist on terrestrial
planets in the habitable zone have also accelerated. These efforts have ranged
from analytical, to simple 0-D, 1-D, and 2-D models, to highly-sophisticated 3D
global climate models (GCMs) adapted from Earth climate and weather models. The
advantage of the latter is that fewer physical processes are reduced to simple
parameterizations and empirical fits, and may instead be represented by
physically-motivated algorithms. However, many such models are difficult to
use, and take a long time to reach a converged state relative to simpler
models, thereby limiting the amount of parameter space that can be explored. We
use PlaSim, a 3D climate model of intermediate complexity, to bridge this gap,
allowing us to produce hundreds to thousands of model outputs that have reached
energy balance equilibrium at the surface and top of the atmosphere. We are
making our model outputs available to the community in a permanent Dataverse
repository (https://dataverse.scholarsportal.info/dataverse/kmenou). A subset
of our model outputs can be used directly with external spectral postprocessing
tools, and we have used them with petitRADTRANS and SBDART in order to create
synthetic observables representative of fully-3D climates. Another natural use
of this repository will be to use more-sophisticated GCMs to cross-check and
verify PlaSim's results, and to explore in more detail those regions of the
exoplanet parameter space identified in our PlaSim results as being of
particular interest. We will continue to add models to this repository in the
future, including more than 1000 models in the short- to medium-term future,
expanding the diversity of climates represented therein.

There are at least two different bijective explanations of this formula, one by

used the finite field method to derive a formula for the number of
$k$-dimensional faces of the Shi arrangement for any $k$. Until now, the

extend a bijection for regions defined by Bernardi to obtain a bijection

converted to a simple set of functions of the form $f: [n-1] \to [n+1]$

surveillance. Risk, trust, and bias (R-T-B) are emerging measures of
performance of such systems. The existing studies on the R-T-B impact on system
performance mostly ignore the complementary nature of R-T-B and their causal
relationships, for instance, risk of trust, risk of bias, and risk of trust
over biases. This paper offers a complete taxonomy of the R-T-B causal
performance regulators for the biometric-enabled DSS. The proposed novel
taxonomy links the R-T-B assessment to the causal inference mechanism for
reasoning in decision making. Practical details of the R-T-B assessment in the

biometric and the risk of bias in face biometrics. The paper also outlines the
emerging applications of the proposed approach beyond biometrics, including
decision support for epidemiological surveillance such as for COVID-19

copper oxide layers and interlayer charge reservoirs. When not doped, these
cuprates are antiferromagnetic insulators. We propose to design new materials
by combining alternating layers of parents of hole-doped and electron-doped of
these cuprates and modifications thereof. Our goal is to find undoped cuprates
that can be either an antiferromagnetic insulator or a quantum metal. The term
quantum metal means a metal characterized by long range antiferromagnetic order
or only strong antiferromagnetic correlations, i.e., it is thus a stable ground
state against any other perturbations. The new metallic states sought here
could be precursors to new superconducting states in the absence or presence of
doping. Using the density functional theory, we report on two compounds
{La}{Pr}CuO4 and {La}{V}CuO4 that illustrate the different physics described
above. The curly brackets mean that the preparation of these compounds shall be
done by depositing a layer containing Pr, then one CuO2 layer, then finally the
La layer in {La}{Pr}CuO4 for example. The configuration formed by the positions
of the charge reservoir atoms with respect to the CuO2 layer is an important
factor in the new procedure we propose here. This paper reports on the X-ray
diffraction, electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of these hypothetical

an undoped correlated quantum metal with long-range order. Our calculations
were performed using the linearized plane wave method (FP-LAPW) implemented

Second, to maximize the performance of the feature extractor we propose a
reconstruction module that generates accurate high-resolution images from
overscaled feature maps and can be independently used to improve existing

and peripheral blood. The model includes CD4 T-lymphocytes in several states
(quiescent Q, naive N and activated T), cytotoxic CD8 T-cells, B-cells and
dendritic cells. Cytokines and immunoglobulins specific for each antigen (i.e.
gp41 or p24) have been also included in the model, modelling the atraction
effect of CD4 T-cells to the infected area and the reduction of virus
concentration by immunoglobulins. HIV virus infection of CD4 T-lymphocytes is
modelled in several stages: before fusion as HIV-attached (H) and after fusion
as non-permissive / abortively infected (M), and permissive / latently infected
(L) and permissive / actively infected (I). These equations have been
implemented in a C++/Python interface application, called Immune System app,
which runs Open Modelica software to solve the ODE system through a 4th order
Runge-Kutta numerical approximation. Results of the simulation show that
although HIV virus concentration in both compartments is lower than $10^{-10}$
virus/$\mu L$ after t=2 years, quiescent lymphocytes reach an equilibrium with
a concentration lower than the initial conditions, due to the latency state,
which serves as a reservoir in time of virus production. As a conclusion, this

that is, systems with inputs and outputs. In this framework, open systems are
seen as the morphisms of a category and can be composed as such, allowing
larger open systems to be built up from smaller ones. Much work has already
been done in this direction, but there is a problem: the notion of isomorphism
between decorated cospans is often too restrictive. Here we introduce and
compare two ways around this problem: structured cospans, and a new version of
decorated cospans. Structured cospans are very simple: given a functor $L
\colon \mathsf{A} \to \mathsf{X}$, a `structured cospan' is a diagram in
$\mathsf{X}$ of the form $L(a) \rightarrow x \leftarrow L(b)$. If $\mathsf{A}$
and $\mathsf{X}$ have finite colimits and $L$ is a left adjoint, there is a
symmetric monoidal category whose objects are those of $\mathsf{A}$ and whose
morphisms are isomorphism classes of structured cospans. However, this category
arises from a more fundamental structure: a symmetric monoidal double category.
Under certain conditions this symmetric monoidal double category is equivalent
to one built using our new version of decorated cospans. We apply these ideas
to symmetric monoidal double categories of open electrical circuits, open
Markov processes and open Petri nets.

narrow-band emission process, where the wide-band nature of the measured FRB
spectrum is due to relativistic motions. Although this scenario and the simple

a dimension-adaptive pooling (DAP) layer that makes DNNs flexible and more
robust to changes in sensor availability and in sampling rate. DAP operates on
convolutional filter maps of variable dimensions and produces an input of fixed

DAT comprises the random selection of dimensions during the forward passes and

differential equations that encode nominal behaviors on a space and can be used
to define the behavior of a smooth optimizer. Optimization fabrics can encode
commonalities among optimization problems that reflect the structure of the
space itself, enabling smooth optimization processes to intelligently navigate
each problem even when optimizing simple naive potential functions.
Importantly, optimization over a fabric is inherently asymptotically stable.
The majority of this paper is dedicated to the development of a tool set for
the design and use of a broad class of fabrics called geometric fabrics.
Geometric fabrics encode behavior as general nonlinear geometries which are
covariant second-order differential equations with a special homogeneity
property that ensures their behavior is independent of the system's speed
through the medium. A class of Finsler Lagrangian energies can be used to both
define how these nonlinear geometries combine with one another and how they
react when potential functions force them from their nominal paths.
Furthermore, these geometric fabrics are closed under the standard operations
of pullback and combination on a transform tree. For behavior representation,
this class of geometric fabrics constitutes a broad class of spectral
semi-sprays (specs), also known as Riemannian Motion Policies (RMPs) in the
context of robotic motion generation, that captures both the intuitive

analog non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies have been explored for deep
neural networks (DNN) to improve energy efficiency. Such architectures,
however, leverage charge conservation, an operation with infinite resolution,
and thus are susceptible to errors. The computations in DNN realized by analog
NVM thus have high uncertainty due to the device stochasticity. Several reports
have demonstrated the use of analog NVM for CIM in a limited scale. It is
unclear whether the uncertainties in computations will prohibit large-scale
DNNs. To explore this critical issue of scalability, this paper first presents
a simulation framework to evaluate the feasibility of large-scale DNNs based on
CIM architecture and analog NVM. Simulation results show that DNNs trained for
high-precision digital computing engines are not resilient against the
uncertainty of the analog NVM devices. To avoid such catastrophic failures,
this paper introduces the analog floating-point representation for the DNN, and
the Hessian-Aware Stochastic Gradient Descent (HA-SGD) training algorithm to
enhance the inference accuracy of trained DNNs. As a result of such
enhancements, DNNs such as Wide ResNets for the CIFAR-100 image recognition
problem are demonstrated to have significant performance improvements in
accuracy without adding cost to the inference hardware.

StyleFlow as a simple, effective, and robust solution to both the sub-problems
by formulating conditional exploration as an instance of conditional continuous

evaluate our method using the face and the car latent space of StyleGAN, and
demonstrate fine-grained disentangled edits along various attributes on both

first formulate the shock stability problem as an initial-boundary value
problem with the leading conical shock-front as a free boundary, and then
establish the existence and asymptotic behavior of global entropy solutions of
bounded variation (BV) of the problem. To achieve this, we first develop a
modified Glimm scheme to construct approximate solutions via self-similar
solutions as building blocks in order to incorporate with the geometric source
term. Then we introduce the Glimm-type functional, based on the local
interaction estimates between weak waves, the strong leading conical shock, and
self-similar solutions, as well as the estimates of the center changes of the
self-similar solutions. To make sure the decreasing of the Glimm-type
functional, we choose appropriate weights by careful asymptotic analysis of the
reflection coefficients in the interaction estimates, when the Mach number of
the incoming flow is sufficiently large. Finally, we establish the existence of
global entropy solutions involving a strong leading conical shock-front,
besides weak waves, under the conditions that the Mach number of the incoming
flow is sufficiently large and the weighted total variation of the slopes of
the generating curve of the Lipschitz perturbed cone is sufficiently small.
Furthermore, the entropy solution is shown to approach asymptotically the
self-similar solution that is determined by the incoming flow and the
asymptotic tangent of the cone boundary at infinity.

meaningful. For edge-colorings using $n-1$ colors and without rainbow cycles,
known in the literature as JL-colorings, there turns out to be a particularly
nice way of counting the rainbow spanning trees and we solve this problem
completely for JL-colored complete graphs $K_n$ and complete bipartite graphs
$K_{n,m}$. In both cases, we find tight upper and lower bounds; the lower bound
for $K_n$, in particular, proves to have an unexpectedly chaotic and

general graphs and prove several results including characterizing graphs which
have JL-colorings achieving the lowest possible number of rainbow spanning

providing electrical and photonic connections to every pixel, previous systems
have been restricted to fewer than 20 pixels. Here, we demonstrate the first

materials. Here, we present a DFT+$U$+$V$ study on 2D FEs represented by
single-layer $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ and its homologous III$_2$-VI$_3$ compounds
with both out-of-plane and in-plane polarization, using Hubbard parameters
computed from first-principles. We find that ACBN0, a pseudo-hybrid density
functional that allows self-consistent determination of $U$ parameters,
improves the prediction of band gaps for all investigated 2D FEs with a
computational cost much lower than the hybrid density functional. The
inter-site Coulomb interaction $V$ becomes critical for accurate descriptions
of the electronic structures of van der Waals heterostructures such as bilayer
In$_2$Se$_3$ and In$_2$Se$_3$/InTe. Pertinent to the study of FE-based
catalysis, we find that the application of self-consistent $U$ corrections can
strongly affect the adsorption energies of open-shell molecules on the polar
surfaces of 2D FEs.

for $N=1,2,3,4,5$ and also for $N=3k+2$, which generalizes the situation in
$N=2,5$. For $N=1$ a triangle identity is obtained. For $N=2,5$ it is found
that the realization of duality implies slight variations of a star-triangle

version of the asymmetric STR. The second case is a new duality for $2d$
$\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ $USp(2N)$ theories with matter in the antisymmetric tensor

associated to a triangle type identity for any value of $N$. In all cases
Boltzmann weights as well as interaction and normalization factors are

a large range of rotational support in their stellar kinematics, which
correspond to ranges in their physical structure. We find that
pressure-supported S0s with $v/{\sigma}$ below 0.5 tend to be more compact and
feature misaligned stellar and gas components, suggesting an external origin
for their gas. We postulate that these S0s are consistent with being formed
through a merger process. Meanwhile, comparisons of ellipticity, stellar mass
and S\'ersic index distributions with spiral galaxies shows that the
rotationally supported S0s with $v/{\sigma}$ above 0.5 are more consistent with
a faded spiral origin. In addition, a simulated merger pathway involving a
compact elliptical and gas-rich satellite results in an S0 that lies within the
pressure-supported group. We conclude that two S0 formation pathways are
active, with mergers dominating in isolated galaxies and small groups, and the
faded spiral pathway being most prominent in large groups ($10^{13} < M_{halo}

\sin \Theta (\widehat{\U}_k, \U_k) \|_q$ for any $q \geq 1$. We show the upper
bounds of mode-$k$ singular subspace estimation are unilateral and converge
linearly to a quantity characterized by blockwise errors of the perturbation
and signal strength. For the tensor reconstruction error bound, we express the
bound through a simple quantity $\xi$, which depends only on perturbation and
the multilinear rank of the underlying signal. Rate matching deterministic
lower bound for tensor reconstruction, which demonstrates the optimality of
HOOI, is also provided. Furthermore, we prove that one-step HOOI (i.e., HOOI
with only a single iteration) is also optimal in terms of tensor reconstruction
and can be used to lower the computational cost. The perturbation results are
also extended to the case that only partial modes of $\bcT$ have low-rank
structure. We support our theoretical results by extensive numerical studies.
Finally, we apply the novel perturbation bounds of HOOI on two applications,
tensor denoising and tensor co-clustering, from machine learning and
statistics, which demonstrates the superiority of the new perturbation results.

we also learn a labeling net to correct the labels of in-distribution noisy

can emit continuous gravitational wave (GW) signals. The spin frequencies and
their distribution of radio millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and accreting MSPs
provide some evidences of GW radiation, and MSPs are ideal probes detecting
high frequency GW signals. It is generally thought that MSPs originate from the
recycled process, in which the NS accretes the material and angular momentum
from the donor star. The accreted matter would be confined at the polar cap
zone by an equatorial belt of compressed magnetic field fixed in the deep crust
of the NS, and yields ""magnetic mountain"". Based on an assumption that the
spin-down rates of three transitional MSPs including PSR J1023+0038 are the
combinational contribution of the accretion torque, the propeller torque, and
the GW radiation torque, in this work we attempt to constrain the ellipticities
of MSPs with observed spin-down rates. Assuming some canonical parameters of
NSs, the ellipticities of three transitional MSPs and ten redbacks are
estimated to be $\epsilon=(0.9-23.4)\times 10^{-9}$. The electrical
resistivities of three transitional MSPs are also derived to be in the range
$\eta=(1.2-15.3)\times 10^{-31}~\rm s$, which display an ideal power law
relation with the accretion rate. The characteristic strains ($h_{\rm
c}=(0.6-2.5)\times10^{-27}$) of GW signals emitting by these sources are
obviously beyond the sensitivity scope of the aLIGO. We expect that the
third-generation GW detectors like the Einstein Telescope can seize the GW
signals from these sources in the future.

GRB~140423A, which was discovered by \emph{Swift}/BAT and by {\it Fermi}/GBM.
Its broadband afterglow was monitored by {\it Swift}/XRT and ground-based
optical telescopes from $T_0+$70.96~s to 4.8~d after the {\it Swift}/BAT
trigger. This is one more case of prompt optical emission observation. The
temporal and spectral joint fit of the multiwavelength light curves of GRB
140423A reveals that achromatic behavior is consistent with the external shock
model including a transition from a stellar wind to the interstellar medium
(ISM) and energy injection. In terms of the optical light curves, there is an
onset bump in the early afterglow with a rising index $\alpha_{\rm O,I} = -0.59
\pm 0.04$ (peaking at $t_{\rm peak}-T_0 \approx 206$~s). It then decays with a
steep index $\alpha_{\rm O,II} = 1.78 \pm 0.03$, and shows a steeper to flatter
""transition"" with $\alpha_{\rm O,III} = 1.13 \pm 0.03$ at around $T_0 +
5000$~s. The observed X-ray afterglow reflects an achromatic behavior, as does
the optical light curve. There is no obvious evolution of the spectral energy
distribution between the X-ray and optical afterglow, with an average value of
the photon index $\Gamma \approx 1.95$. This ""transition"" is consistent with an
external shock model having the circumburst medium transition from a wind to
the ISM, by introducing a long-lasting energy injection with a Lorentz factor
stratification of the ejecta. The best parameters from Monte Carlo Markov Chain

designing an effective model to extract ground-ing information from both visual

emphasizes which words to listen and attends to sentence information via
vanilla soft attention, but clues from query-by-video interactions implying

Fine-grained Iterative Attention Network (FIAN) that consists of an iterative
attention module for bilateral query-video in-formation extraction.
Specifically, in the iterative attention module, each word in the query is
first enhanced by attending to each frame in the video through fine-grained
attention, then video iteratively attends to the integrated query. Finally,
both video and query information is utilized to provide robust cross-modal
representation for further moment localization. In addition, to better predict

important practice in documenting vulnerabilities is to describe the key
vulnerability aspects, such as vulnerability type, root cause, affected
product, impact, attacker type and attack vector, for the effective search and
management of fast-growing vulnerabilities. We investigate 120,103
vulnerability reports in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) over
the past 20 years. We find that 56%, 85%, 38% and 28% of CVEs miss
vulnerability type, root causes, attack vector and attacker type respectively.
To help to complete the missing information of these vulnerability aspects, we
propose a neural-network based approach for predicting the missing information
of a key aspect of a vulnerability based on the known aspects of the
vulnerability. We explore the design space of the neural network models and
empirically identify the most effective model design. Using a large-scale

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been attracting increasing attention
in hyperspectral (HS) image classification, owing to their ability to capture
spatial-spectral feature representations. Nevertheless, their ability in
modeling relations between samples remains limited. Beyond the limitations of
grid sampling, graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have been recently proposed
and successfully applied in irregular (or non-grid) data representation and
analysis. In this paper, we thoroughly investigate CNNs and GCNs (qualitatively
and quantitatively) in terms of HS image classification. Due to the
construction of the adjacency matrix on all the data, traditional GCNs usually
suffer from a huge computational cost, particularly in large-scale remote
sensing (RS) problems. To this end, we develop a new mini-batch GCN (called
miniGCN hereinafter) which allows to train large-scale GCNs in a mini-batch
fashion. More significantly, our miniGCN is capable of inferring out-of-sample
data without re-training networks and improving classification performance.
Furthermore, as CNNs and GCNs can extract different types of HS features, an
intuitive solution to break the performance bottleneck of a single model is to
fuse them. Since miniGCNs can perform batch-wise network training (enabling the
combination of CNNs and GCNs) we explore three fusion strategies: additive
fusion, element-wise multiplicative fusion, and concatenation fusion to measure
the obtained performance gain. Extensive experiments, conducted on three HS
datasets, demonstrate the advantages of miniGCNs over GCNs and the superiority
of the tested fusion strategies with regards to the single CNN or GCN models.

of freedom of the whole system is a large but finite number, such a local
relaxation would come across a recurrence after a certain time, namely, the
dynamics of the local system suddenly appear random after a well-ordered
oscillatory decay process. It is found in this paper, for a collection of $N$
two-level systems (TLSs), the local relaxation of one TLS within has a
hierarchy structure hiding in the randomness after such a recurrence: similar
recurrences appear in a periodical way, and the later recurrence brings in
stronger randomness than the previous one. Both analytical and numerical
results that we obtained well explains such hierarchy recurrences: the
population of the local TLS (as an open system) diffuses out and regathers back
periodically due the finite-size effect of the bath [the remaining $(N-1)$
TLSs]. We also find that the total correlation entropy, which sums up the
entropy of all the $N$ TLSs, approximately exhibit a monotonic increase; in
contrast, the entropy of each single TLS increases and decreases from time to

which explores reconfigurable radio reflection with a surface/plane made of
metamaterial units for multi-user localization. By changing the reflectivity of

improves localization accuracy by making RSS values at adjacent locations have

radio maps for all the radio environments generated by metamaterial units and
select suitable maps from all the possible maps to realize a high accuracy
localization. To tackle this challenge, we propose a compressive construction
technique which can predict all the possible radio maps, and propose a

a significant improvement from a decimeter-level localization error in the

battery, and the thermodynamics of the lithiation of graphitic electrodes have
been heavily investigated. Intercalated lithium in bulk graphite undergoes
structural ordering known as staging to minimize electrostatic repulsions
within the crystal lattice. While this process is well-understood for bulk
graphite, confinement effects become important at the nanoscale, which can
significantly impact the electrochemistry of nanostructured electrodes.
Therefore, graphene offers a model platform to study intercalation dynamics at
the nanoscale by combining on-chip device fabrication and electrochemical
intercalation with in situ characterization. We show that microscale mechanical
strain significantly affects the formation of ordered lithium phases in
graphene. In situ Raman spectroscopy of graphene microflakes mechanically
constrained at the edge during lithium intercalation reveals a
thickness-dependent increase of up to 1.26 V in the electrochemical potential
that induces lithium staging. While the induced mechanical strain energy
increases with graphene thickness to the fourth power, its magnitude is small
compared to the observed increase in electrochemical energy. We hypothesize
that the mechanical strain energy increases a nucleation barrier for lithium
staging, greatly delaying the formation of ordered lithium phases. Our results
indicate that electrode assembly can critically impact lithium staging dynamics
important for cycling rates and power generation for batteries. We demonstrate
strain engineering in two-dimensional nanomaterials as an approach to
manipulate phase transitions and chemical reactivity.

multi-wavelength Raman spectroscopy, we investigated three types of graphene
bound on Cu: graphene grown on Cu foils and Cu film/SiO2, and Cu-evaporated
exfoliated graphene. 2D peak frequencies of the first two samples were ~17 cm-1
higher than expected for 1.96 eV excitation even when the effect of strain was

be significantly reduced by backing Cu films with dielectric substrates of

cavities of gravitational wave detectors. Although gravitational wave detectors
are extremely sensitive for measuring the differential arm length changes, the
sensitivity to dark matter is largely attenuated, as the effect of dark matter
is mostly common to arm cavity test masses. Here, we propose to use auxiliary
length channels, which measure the changes in the power and signal recycling
cavity lengths and the differential Michelson interferometer length. The
sensitivity to dark matter can be enhanced by exploiting the fact that
auxiliary interferometers are more asymmetric than two arm cavities. We show
that the sensitivity to $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson dark matter with masses below
$7\times 10^{-14}$ eV can be greatly enhanced when our method is applied to a
cryogenic gravitational wave detector KAGRA, which employs sapphire test masses

the mean and variance of infected individuals that reproduce the SIS epidemic
model at some point. This stochastic SIS epidemic model can be interpreted as a
Hamiltonian system, therefore we wondered if it could be geometrically handled
through the theory of Lie--Hamilton systems, and this happened to be the case.
The primordial result is that we are able to obtain a general solution for the
stochastic/ SIS-epidemic model (with fluctuations) in form of a nonlinear
superposition rule that includes particular stochastic solutions and certain
constants to be related to initial conditions of the contagion process. The
choice of these initial conditions will be crucial to display the expected
behavior of the curve of infections during the epidemic. We shall limit these
constants to nonsingular regimes and display graphics of the behavior of the
solutions. As one could expect, the increase of infected individuals follows a
sigmoid-like curve.
  Lie--Hamiltonian systems admit a quantum deformation, so does the stochastic
SIS-epidemic model. We present this generalization as well. If one wants to
study the evolution of an SIS epidemic under the influence of a constant heat
source (like centrally heated buildings), one can make use of quantum
stochastic differential equations coming from the so-called quantum
deformation.

outperformed traditional parallel approaches on the quality of synthesized
speech. However, they introduce new problems at the same time. Due to the
autoregressive nature, the time cost of inference has to be proportional to the
length of text, which pose a great challenge for online serving. On the other
hand, the style of synthetic speech becomes unstable and may change obviously
among sentences. In this paper, we propose a Phrase based Parallel End-to-End
TTS System (PPSpeech) to address these issues. PPSpeech uses autoregression
approach within a phrase and executes parallel strategies for different
phrases. By this method, we can achieve both high quality and high efficiency.
In addition, we propose acoustic embedding and text context embedding as the
conditions of encoder to keep successive and prevent from abrupt style or
timbre change. Experiments show that, the synthesis speed of PPSpeech is much
faster than sentence level autoregressive Tacotron 2 when a sentence has more
than 5 phrases. The speed advantage increases with the growth of sentence
length. Subjective experiments show that the proposed system with acoustic
embedding and context embedding as conditions can make the style transition

respect to the parameters, we show that the training error is at most of the
order $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$. Furthermore, if the loss inducing
the empirical risk attains its minimum, the optimal parameters converge to
minimal $L^2$--norm parameters which interpolate the dataset. By a natural
scaling between $T$ and the regularization hyperparameter $\lambda$ we obtain
the same results when $\lambda\searrow0$ and $T$ is fixed. This allows us to
stipulate generalization properties in the overparametrized regime, now seen
from the large depth, neural ODE perspective. To enhance the polynomial decay,
inspired by turnpike theory in optimal control, we propose a learning problem

impressive performance in various natural language understanding tasks.
However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus
suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention
heads query on the whole input sequence for generating the attention map from a
global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local
dependencies, which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore
propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to replace these self-attention
heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads,
together with the rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block
that is more efficient at both global and local context learning. We equip BERT
with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have
shown that ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various
downstream tasks, with lower training cost and fewer model parameters.
Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than
ELECTRAbase, while using less than 1/4 training cost. Code and pre-trained

are mostly set up with deterministic settings. Given the coarse-grained
modeling in theories of fluids, considerable uncertainties may exist between
flow-field solutions and real-world physics. To study the emergence,
propagation and evolution of uncertainties from molecular to hydrodynamic level
poses great opportunities and challenges to develop both sound theories and
reliable multi-scale algorithms. In this paper, we study the stochastic
behavior of multi-scale gas dynamic systems, especially focusing on the
non-equilibrium effects. The theoretical analysis is presented on the basis of
kinetic model equation and its upscaling macroscopic system, with the
reformulation from the stochastic Galerkin method. A newly developed stochastic
kinetic scheme is employed to conduct numerical simulation of homogeneous
relaxation, normal shock structure, shear layer and lid-driven cavity problems.
Different kinds of uncertainties are involved in conjunction with the gas
evolutionary processes. New physical observations, such as the synergistic
propagation pattern between mean fields and uncertainties, sensitivity of
different orders of uncertainties, and the influence of boundary effects from
continuum to rarefied regimes, will be identified and analyzed theoretically.
The paper serves as a heuristic study of quantifying the uncertainties within
multi-scale flow dynamics.

barrier positions and heights. In the present theoretical study, we illustrated
that the approximation is inaccurate when torsional modes present non-uniformly

reconstruct approximate potential to replace the periodic potential by using
information of the local minima and their Voronoi tessellation. First, we
established asymmetric barrier heights by introducing two periodicity
parameters and assuming that the exact barrier positions are at the boundaries
of Voronoi cells. Second, we used multiplicatively weighted Voronoi
tessellation to refine the barrier heights and positions by defining a
structure-related distance metric. The proposed method has been tested for a
few higher-dimensional cases, all of which show promising improved accuracy.

research because they enable the evaluation of events or interventions that are
difficult or impossible to manipulate experimentally, such as many policy and
health system reforms. However, there remains ambiguity in the literature about
their definition and how they differ from randomised controlled experiments and
from other observational designs.
  Methods: We conceptualise natural experiments in in the context of public
health evaluations, align the study design to the Target Trial Framework, and
provide recommendation for improvement of their design and reporting.
  Results: Natural experiment studies combine features of experiments and
non-experiments. They differ from RCTs in that exposure allocation is not
controlled by researchers while they differ from other observational designs in
that they evaluate the impact of event or exposure changes. As a result they
are, in theory, less susceptible to bias than other observational study
designs. Importantly, the strength of causal inferences relies on the
plausibility that the exposure allocation can be considered ""as-if randomised"".
The target trial framework provides a systematic basis for assessing the
plausibility of such claims, and enables a structured method for assessing
other design elements.
  Conclusions: Natural experiment studies should be considered a distinct study
design rather than a set of tools for analyses of non-randomised interventions.
Alignment of natural experiments to the Target Trial framework will clarify the
strength of evidence underpinning claims about the effectiveness of public
health interventions.

the ocean. In a stably stratified Boussinesq fluid, this irreversible mixing
describes the conversion of available potential energy (APE) to background
potential energy (BPE). In some settings the APE framework is difficult to
apply and approximate measures are used to estimate irreversible mixing. For
example, numerical simulations of stratified turbulence often use triply
periodic domains to increase computational efficiency. In this setup however,
BPE is not uniquely defined and the method of Winters et al. (1995, J. Fluid
Mech., 289) cannot be directly applied to calculate the APE. We propose a new
technique to calculate APE in periodic domains with a mean stratification. By
defining a control volume bounded by surfaces of constant buoyancy, we can
construct an appropriate background buoyancy profile $b_\ast(z,t)$ and
accurately quantify diapycnal mixing in such systems. This technique also
permits the accurate calculation of a finite amplitude local APE density in
periodic domains. The evolution of APE is analysed in various turbulent
stratified flow simulations. We show that the mean dissipation rate of buoyancy
variance $\chi$ provides a good approximation to the mean diapycnal mixing
rate, even in flows with significant variations in local stratification. When
quantifying measures of mixing efficiency in transient flows, we find
significant variation depending on whether laminar diffusion of a mean flow is
included in the kinetic energy dissipation rate. We discuss how best to
interpret these results in the context of quantifying diapycnal diffusivity in
real oceanographic flows.

improvement of accuracy in recent years. However, existing methods for
lipreading mainly build on autoregressive (AR) model, which generate target
tokens one by one and suffer from high inference latency. To breakthrough this
constraint, we propose FastLR, a non-autoregressive (NAR) lipreading model
which generates all target tokens simultaneously. NAR lipreading is a
challenging task that has many difficulties: 1) the discrepancy of sequence
lengths between source and target makes it difficult to estimate the length of
the output sequence; 2) the conditionally independent behavior of NAR
generation lacks the correlation across time which leads to a poor
approximation of target distribution; 3) the feature representation ability of
encoder can be weak due to lack of effective alignment mechanism; and 4) the
removal of AR language model exacerbates the inherent ambiguity problem of
lipreading. Thus, in this paper, we introduce three methods to reduce the gap
between FastLR and AR model: 1) to address challenges 1 and 2, we leverage
integrate-and-fire (I\&F) module to model the correspondence between source
video frames and output text sequence. 2) To tackle challenge 3, we add an
auxiliary connectionist temporal classification (CTC) decoder to the top of the
encoder and optimize it with extra CTC loss. We also add an auxiliary
autoregressive decoder to help the feature extraction of encoder. 3) To
overcome challenge 4, we propose a novel Noisy Parallel Decoding (NPD) for I\&F
and bring Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) into lipreading. Our experiments exhibit
that FastLR achieves the speedup up to 10.97$\times$ comparing with
state-of-the-art lipreading model with slight WER absolute increase of 1.5\%
and 5.5\% on GRID and LRS2 lipreading datasets respectively, which demonstrates
the effectiveness of our proposed method.

essential task in night-time intelligent surveillance systems. Except for the
intra-modality variance that RGB-RGB person re-identification mainly overcomes,
VI-ReID suffers from additional inter-modality variance caused by the inherent
heterogeneous gap. To solve the problem, we present a carefully designed dual
Gaussian-based variational auto-encoder (DG-VAE), which disentangles an
identity-discriminable and an identity-ambiguous cross-modality feature
subspace, following a mixture-of-Gaussians (MoG) prior and a standard Gaussian
distribution prior, respectively. Disentangling cross-modality
identity-discriminable features leads to more robust retrieval for VI-ReID. To
achieve efficient optimization like conventional VAE, we theoretically derive
two variational inference terms for the MoG prior under the supervised setting,
which not only restricts the identity-discriminable subspace so that the model
explicitly handles the cross-modality intra-identity variance, but also enables
the MoG distribution to avoid posterior collapse. Furthermore, we propose a
triplet swap reconstruction (TSR) strategy to promote the above disentangling
process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on two VI-ReID datasets.

trees for each multicast transmission session and distributing the traffic load
over all available routes in the cloud computing resources. The SDN is utilized
to tackle with various design hurdles in the cloud computing, including both
the current ones with the conventional multicast pattern and the newly emerged
ones with multi-tree multicast. The prototype implementation and experiments

NMPC with an online weight update strategy for fast, agile, and precise

white dwarf, with a distance and proper motion consistent with a physical
association with the planetary system. We present spectroscopy of the white
dwarf, with the aim of determining its mass, radius and temperature and hence
the age of the system. However, the spectra show the featureless continuum and
lack of spectral lines characteristic of the DC class of white dwarfs. We
therefore fitted theoretical white dwarf spectra to the ugriz apparent
magnitudes and Gaia DR2 parallax of this object in order to determine its
physical properties and the age of the system. We find that the system is old,
with a lower limit of 3.6 Gyr, but theoretical uncertainties preclude a precise
determination of its age. Its kinematics are consistent with membership of the
thick disc, but do not allow us to rule out the thin-disc alternative. The old
age and low metallicity of the system suggest it is subject to an
age-metallicity relation, but analysis of the most metal-rich and metal-poor
transiting planetary systems yields only insubstantial evidence of this. We
conclude that the study of bound white dwarfs can yield independent ages to
planetary systems, but such analysis may be better-suited to DA and DB rather
than DC white dwarfs.

successfully realized the generation of efficient chiral terahertz waves with

made use of the concept of minimum spanning tree obtained from the weighted
graph in the focal landscape, which suggested a viable corridor network for the
tiger population of the Protected Areas (PAs) in the landscape complex.
Centralities of the network identify the habitat patches and the critical
parameters that are central to the process of tiger movement across the
network. We extend the concept of vertex centrality to that of the simplicial
centrality yielding inter-vertices adjacency and connection. As a result, the
ecological information propagates expeditiously and even on a local scale in
these networks representing a well-integrated and self-explanatory model as a
community structure. A simplicial complex network based on the network
centralities calculated in the landscape matrix presents a tiger corridor
network in the landscape complex that is proposed to correspond better to

functional and structural properties of the network, the work proposes an
ecological network of corridors for the most tenable usage by the tiger

active beamforming at the access point (AP) and passive beamforming at the RIS
for the case where the RIS's state information is statistically known by the
AP, and propose a high-quality suboptimal solution based on the alternating
optimization technique. We analyze the asymptotic outage probability of the
proposed scheme under Rayleigh fading channels, for which a closed-form
expression is derived. The achievable rate of the proposed scheme is also
investigated for the case where the transmitted symbol is drawn from a finite

(BHXRBs) are a class of low-frequency QPOs that are observed in the soft
intermediate state in the rising and the declining phases of an outburst. They
are suspected to result from the precession of the jet that is ejected from the
source. The objective of the present work is to investigate in detail the
emissivity of the jet in hard X-rays and to see whether the type-B QPOs from GX
339-4, which is the best studied black-hole transient, can be explained
quantitatively with a precessing jet. We used our simple jet model, which
invokes Comptonization in the jet, and examined the angular dependence of the
upscattered photons that emerge from the jet and their energy distribution,
which is a power law. Due to the elongation of the jet, assisted by the bulk
motion of the electrons, the angular distribution of the emerging hard X-ray
photons from the jet is not isotropic. More importantly, the photon-number
spectral index, $\Gamma,$ is an increasing function of the polar angle,
$\theta,$ with respect to the axis of the jet. If the jet is fixed, then an
observer at infinity sees the photon index, $\Gamma,$ which corresponds to this
specific observational direction. However, if the jet is precessing, then the
observer sees a periodic variation of $\Gamma$ with the precession period. Such
a periodic variation of $\Gamma$ has been observed in GX 339-4 and in this
work, we reproduce it quantitatively, using our model. Our jet model nicely
explains through quantitative means the type-B QPOs seen in GX 339-4 as
originating from a precessing jet. The given model has previously explained
several observed correlations thus far.

between s-wave superconductivity, spin-orbit coupling, and an external magnetic
field. These states have been observed in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid
nanostructures in the presence of a Zeeman field, and in the limit of a low
density of particles. In this paper, we demonstrate and discuss the possibility
of the emergence of Majorana bound states in a superconducting Rashba nanowire
deposited on an antiferromagnetically ordered surface. We calculate the
relevant topological invariant in several complementary ways. Studying the
topological phase diagram reveals two branches of the non trivial topological
phase -- a main branch, which is typical for Rashba nanowires, and an
additional branch emerging due to the antiferromagnetic order. In the case of
the additional topological branch, Majorana bound states can also exist close
to half-filling, obviating the need for either doping or gating the nanowire to
reach the low density regime. Moreover, we show the emergence of the Majorana
bound states in the absence of the external magnetic field, which is possible
due to the antiferromagnetic order. We also discuss the properties of the bound
states in the context of real space localization and the spectral function of
the system. This allows one to perceive the band inversion within the spin and
sublattice subspaces in the additional branch, contrary to the main branch,
where the only band inversion reported in previous studies exists in the spin
subspace. Finally, we demonstrate how these topological phases can be confirmed
experimentally in transport measurements.

relevant for quantum simulations, ranging from arrays of superconducting

understanding is hampered by their large Hilbert space and by their intrinsic
nonequilibrium nature, limiting the applicability of many traditional
approaches. In this work we extend the nonequilibrium bosonic Dynamical Mean
Field Theory (DMFT) to Markovian open quantum systems. Within DMFT, a Lindblad
master equation describing a lattice of dissipative bosonic particles is mapped
onto an impurity problem describing a single site embedded in its Markovian
environment and coupled to a self-consistent field and to a non-Markovian bath,
where the latter accounts for finite lattice connectivity corrections beyond
Gutzwiller mean-field theory. We develop a non-perturbative approach to solve
this bosonic impurity problem, which treats the non-Markovian bath in a
non-crossing approximation. As a first application, we address the steady-state
of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model with two-body losses and incoherent
pump. We show that DMFT captures hopping-induced dissipative processes,
completely missed in Gutzwiller mean-field theory, which crucially determine
the properties of the normal phase, including the redistribution of
steady-state populations, the suppression of local gain and the emergence of a
stationary quantum-Zeno regime. We argue that these processes compete with
coherent hopping to determine the phase transition towards a non-equilibrium
superfluid, leading to a strong renormalization of the phase boundary at
finite-connectivity. We show that this transition occurs as a finite-frequency
instability, leading to an oscillating-in-time order parameter, that we connect
with a quantum many-body synchronization transition of an array of quantum van
der Pol oscillators.

creating annular substructures and planetesimals in protoplanetary disks. We
perform numerical simulations of the secular GI in a radially extended disk
with inward drifting dust grains. The results show that, even in the presence
of the dust diffusion, the dust rings form via the secular GI while the dust
grains are moving inward, and the dust surface density increases by a factor of
ten. Once the secular GI develops into a nonlinear regime, the total mass of
the resultant rings can be a significant fraction of the dust disk mass. In
this way, a large amount of drifting dust grains can be collected in the dusty
rings and stored for planetesimal formation. In contrast to the emergence of
remarkable dust substructures, the secular GI does not create significant gas
substructures. This result indicates that observations of a gas density profile
near the disk midplane enable us to distinguish the mechanisms for creating the
annular substructures in the observed disks. The resultant rings start decaying
once they enter the inner region stable to the secular GI. Since the ring-gap
contrast smoothly decreases, it seems possible that the rings are observed even
in the stable region. We also discuss the likely outcome of the non-linear
growth and indicate the possibility that a significantly developed region of
the secular GI may appear as a gap-like substructure in dust continuum emission
since dust growth into larger solid bodies and planetesimal formation reduce
the total emissivity.

as each movement induces a unique change in the wireless medium. These changes
can be used to identify particular body motions. This work produces a dataset

(ELEvoHI) assumes that the CME frontal shape within the ecliptic plane is an
ellipse, and allows the CME to adjust to the ambient solar wind speed, i.e. it
is drag-based. ELEvoHI is used to perform ensemble simulations by varying the
CME frontal shape within given boundary conditions that are consistent with the
observations made by HI. In this work, we evaluate different set-ups of the
model by performing hindcasts for 15 well-defined isolated CMEs that occurred
when STEREO was near L4/5, between the end of 2008 and the beginning of 2011.

faster compared to a sequential implementation using a two operand adder. Use
cases for such adders occur in modern processors for deep neural networks. Such
processors require massively parallel computing resources on chip. This paper
presents a method to estimate the upper bound on the size of carry. A method to
compute the exact number of carry bits required for a multi-operand addition
operation. A fast combinatorial parallel 4-operand adder module is presented.
An algorithm to reconfigure these adder modules to implement larger adders is
also described. Further, the paper presents two compact but slower iterative
structures that implement multi-operand addition, iterating with one column at
a time till the entire word is covered. Such serial/iterative operations are
slow but occupy small space while parallel operations are fast but use large
silicon area on chip. Interestingly, the area-to-throughput ratio of two
architectures can tilt in favor of slower, smaller and large number units
instead of the fewer numbers of fast and large compute units. A lemma presented
in the paper may be used to identify the condition when such tilt occurs.
Potentially, this can save silicon space and increase the throughput of chips
for high performance computing. Simulation results of a 16 operand adder and
using an set of 4-operand adders for use in neural networks have been
presented. Simulation results show that performance gain improves as the number

to the deteriorating efficiency and power with long transfer distance. WPT
systems based on multi-relay resonators can overcome this problem, which,
however, suffer from sensitivity to perturbations and fabrication

wireless power transfer (TWPT), where energy is transferred efficiently via the
near-field coupling between two topological edge states localized at the ends
of a one-dimensional radiowave topological insulator. Such a TWPT system can be
modelled as a parity-time-symmetric Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with
complex boundary potentials. Besides, the coil configurations are judiciously
designed, which significantly suppress the unwanted cross-couplings between
nonadjacent coils that could break the chiral symmetry of the SSH chain. By
tuning the inter- and intra-cell coupling strengths, we theoretically and
experimentally demonstrate high energy transfer efficiency near the exceptional
point of the topological edge states, even in the presence of disorder. The
combination of topological metamaterials, non-Hermitian physics, and WPT

humans derive semantic representations from perceptual objects, such as color
from an apple, pleasantness from a musical chord, or seriousness from a face.
Markov Chain Monte Carlo with People (MCMCP) is a prominent method for studying
such representations, in which participants are presented with binary choice
trials constructed such that the decisions follow a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
acceptance rule. However, while MCMCP has strong asymptotic properties, its
binary choice paradigm generates relatively little information per trial, and
its local proposal function makes it slow to explore the parameter space and
find the modes of the distribution. Here we therefore generalize MCMCP to a
continuous-sampling paradigm, where in each iteration the participant uses a
slider to continuously manipulate a single stimulus dimension to optimize a
given criterion such as 'pleasantness'. We formulate both methods from a
utility-theory perspective, and show that the new method can be interpreted as
'Gibbs Sampling with People' (GSP). Further, we introduce an aggregation
parameter to the transition step, and show that this parameter can be
manipulated to flexibly shift between Gibbs sampling and deterministic
optimization. In an initial study, we show GSP clearly outperforming MCMCP; we
then show that GSP provides novel and interpretable results in three other
domains, namely musical chords, vocal emotions, and faces. We validate these
results through large-scale perceptual rating experiments. The final
experiments use GSP to navigate the latent space of a state-of-the-art image
synthesis network (StyleGAN), a promising approach for applying GSP to
high-dimensional perceptual spaces. We conclude by discussing future cognitive
applications and ethical implications.

autonomously in an unknown environment by relying only on computer vision
methods for detecting the target gates. Due to the challenges such as
background objects and varying lighting conditions, traditional object
detection algorithms based on colour or geometry tend to fail. Convolutional
neural networks offer impressive advances in computer vision but require an
immense amount of data to learn. Collecting this data is a tedious process

from sensor failures. In this work, a semi-synthetic dataset generation method
is proposed, using a combination of real background images and randomised 3D

not suffer from those drawbacks. Using the detection results, a line-of-sight
guidance algorithm is used to cross the gates. In several experimental

channels improve these issues, data transmission is expensive. Furthermore,
recent research has shown that jointly decoding raw physical layers that are
offloaded by LPWAN gateways in the cloud can improve the signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) of week radio signals. However, when it comes to multiple channels, this
approach requires high bandwidth of network infrastructure to transport a large
amount of PHY samples from gateways to the cloud server, which results in
network congestion and high cost due to Internet data usage. In order to reduce
the operation's bandwidth, we propose a novel LPWAN packet acquisition
mechanism based on Compressive Sensing with a custom design dictionary that
exploits the structure of LPWAN packets, reduces the bit rate of samples on
each gateway, and demodulates PHY in the cloud with (joint) sparse
approximation. Moreover, we propose an adaptive compression method that takes
the Spreading Factor (SF) and SNR into account. Our empirical evaluation shows
that up to 93.7% PHY samples can be reduced by Nephalai when SF = 9 and SNR is
high without degradation in the packet reception rate (PRR). With four
gateways, 1.7x PRR can be achieved with 87.5% PHY samples compressed, which can
extend the battery lifetime of embedded IoT devices to 1.7.

first part, we are able to show that the federate learning (FL) procedure
presented by Kairouz et al. \cite{Kairouz1901}, is a random processing. Namely,
an $m$-ary functionality for the FL procedure can be defined in the context of
multi-party computation (MPC); Furthermore, an instance of FL protocol along
Kairouz et al.'s definition can be viewed as an implementation of the defined
$m$-ary functionality. As such, an instance of FL procedure is also an instance
of MPC protocol. In short, FL is a subset of MPC.
  To privately computing the defined FL (m-ary) functionality, various
techniques such as homomorphic encryption (HE), secure multi-party computation
(SMPC) and differential privacy (DP) have been deployed. In the second part, we
are able to show that if the underlying FL instance privately computes the
defined $m$-ary functionality in the simulation-based framework, then the
simulation-based FL solution is also an instance of SMPC. Consequently, SFL is
a subset of SMPC.

derive task constraints for a constraint-based robot controller from data and
adapt them with respect to previously unseen situations (contexts). We use a

learn explicit communication strategies that enable complex multi-agent
coordination. These works use models of cooperative multi-agent systems whereby
agents strive to achieve a shared global goal. When considering agents with

learning model that accommodates individual non-shared rewards and a
differentiable communication channel that is common among all agents. We focus
on the case where agents have self-interested objectives, and develop a
learning algorithm that elicits the emergence of adversarial communications. We
perform experiments on multi-agent coverage and path planning problems, and
employ a post-hoc interpretability technique to visualize the messages that
agents communicate to each other. We show how a single self-interested agent is
capable of learning highly manipulative communication strategies that allows it
to significantly outperform a cooperative team of agents.

however, relies on early human case series or animal studies mostly obtained in
the pre-antibiotic era, where rigorous statistical analyses were not performed.
It therefore remains unclear whether those early data support such assumptions.
With standard statistical survival models, and based on a systematic literature
review, we re-analyzed 14 radiobiological animal datasets in which animals
received mostly fractionated doses of radiation before or after bacterial/viral
inoculation, and assessing various health endpoints (mortality, pneumonia
morbidity). In most datasets absorbed doses did not exceed 7 Gy. Various
different model systems and types of challenging infection are considered. For
7 studies that evaluated post-inoculation radiation exposure (more relevant to
LDRT for COVID-19 pneumonia) the results are heterogeneous, with 2 studies
showing a significant increase (p<0.001) and another showing a significant
decrease (p<0.001) in mortality associated with radiation exposure. For
pre-inoculation exposure the results are also heterogeneous, with 6 datasets
showing a significant increase (p<0.01) in mortality risk associated with
radiation exposure and the other 2 showing a significant decrease (p<0.05) in
mortality risk. Collectively, these data do not provide clear support for
reductions in morbidity or mortality associated with post-infection radiation
exposure. For pre-infection radiation exposure the inconsistency of direction
of effect makes this body of data difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, one
must be cautious about adducing evidence from the published reports of these

approach for deep-learning based reconstruction of B-mode images from

sub-Nyquist sampled data, time-aligned in the frequency domain and transformed
back to the time domain. The data is further sampled spatially, so that only a
subset of the received signals is acquired. The partial data is used to train
an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network, using as targets
minimum-variance (MV) beamformed signals that were generated from the original,
fully-sampled data. Our approach yields high-quality B-mode images, with higher
resolution than previously proposed reconstruction approaches (NESTA) from
compressed data as well as delay-and-sum beamforming (DAS) of the fully-sampled
data. In terms of contrast to noise ratio, our results are comparable to MV
beamforming of the fully-sampled data, thus enabling better and more efficient
imaging than is mostly used in clinical practice today.

competencies, ranging from simply memorizing questions seen at training time,
to answering novel question formulations with answers seen during training, to
generalizing to completely novel questions with novel answers. However, single
aggregated test set scores do not show the full picture of what capabilities
models truly have. In this work, we perform a detailed study of the test sets
of three popular open-domain benchmark datasets with respect to these
competencies. We find that 60-70% of test-time answers are also present
somewhere in the training sets. We also find that 30% of test-set questions
have a near-duplicate paraphrase in their corresponding training sets. Using
these findings, we evaluate a variety of popular open-domain models to obtain
greater insight into what extent they can actually generalize, and what drives
their overall performance. We find that all models perform dramatically worse
on questions that cannot be memorized from training sets, with a mean absolute
performance difference of 63% between repeated and non-repeated data. Finally
we show that simple nearest-neighbor models out-perform a BART closed-book QA
model, further highlighting the role that training set memorization plays in
these benchmarks

the given type as its only singularities. The set of all such curves is a
quasi-projective variety, which we call an equisingular family (ESF). We

important result is, however, that the necessary and the sufficient conditions
show the same asymptotics for $T$-smooth equisingular families if the degree

  Model","CIKM2020",,,,"cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Social media is a vital means for information-sharing due to its easy access,
low cost, and fast dissemination characteristics. However, increases in social
media usage have corresponded with a rise in the prevalence of cyberbullying.
Most existing cyberbullying detection methods are supervised and, thus, have
two key drawbacks: (1) The data labeling process is often time-consuming and
labor-intensive; (2) Current labeling guidelines may not be generalized to
future instances because of different language usage and evolving social
networks. To address these limitations, this work introduces a principled
approach for unsupervised cyberbullying detection. The proposed model consists
of two main components: (1) A representation learning network that encodes the
social media session by exploiting multi-modal features, e.g., text, network,
and time. (2) A multi-task learning network that simultaneously fits the
comment inter-arrival times and estimates the bullying likelihood based on a
Gaussian Mixture Model. The proposed model jointly optimizes the parameters of
both components to overcome the shortcomings of decoupled training. Our core
contribution is an unsupervised cyberbullying detection model that not only
experimentally outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised models, but also
achieves competitive performance compared to supervised models.

to account for the flavor anomalies. In particular, they can provide the
necessary chiral enhancement (by a factor $m_t/m_\mu$) to address $a_\mu$ with
TeV scale new physics. In this letter we point out that such explanations of
$a_\mu$ also lead to enhanced effects in $h\to\mu^+\mu^-$ and we examine the

Such a seamless integration of graph signal filtering together with metric

the goal of metric learning is just to optimize signal filters or vice versa.
Further, we derive the solution of the graph comparison model as a classic
generalized eigenvalue decomposition problem, which has an exactly closed-form

speaker verification system, by enabling the use of privacy-sensitive speaker
data to train an auxiliary classification model that predicts vocal
characteristics of speakers. In particular, this paper explores the utility
achieved by approaches which combine different federated learning and
differential privacy mechanisms. These approaches make it possible to train a
central model while protecting user privacy, with users' data remaining on
their devices. Furthermore, they make learning on a large population of
speakers possible, ensuring good coverage of speaker characteristics when
training a model. The auxiliary model described here uses features extracted
from phrases which trigger a speaker verification system. From these features,
the model predicts speaker characteristic labels considered useful as side
information. The knowledge of the auxiliary model is distilled into a speaker
verification system using multi-task learning, with the side information labels
predicted by this auxiliary model being the additional task. This approach
results in a 6% relative improvement in equal error rate over a baseline

While the extended finite element (XFEM) has been successfully developed within

its application in natural geoscientific applications is not straightforward.
This is mainly due to the fact that subsurface formations are heterogeneous and
span large length scales with many fractures at different scales. In this work,
we propose a novel multiscale formulation for XFEM, based on locally computed
basis functions. The local multiscale basis functions capture the heterogeneity
and discontinuities introduced by fractures. Local boundary conditions are set
to follow a reduced-dimensional system, in order to preserve the accuracy of
the basis functions. Using these multiscale bases, a multiscale coarse-scale
system is then governed algebraically and solved, in which no enrichment due to
the fractures exist. Such formulation allows for significant computational cost
reduction, at the same time, it preserves the accuracy of the discrete
displacement vector space. The coarse-scale solution is finally interpolated
back to the fine scale system, using the same multiscale basis functions. The
proposed multiscale XFEM (MS-XFEM) is also integrated within a two-stage
algebraic iterative solver, through which error reduction to any desired level
can be achieved. Several proof-of-concept numerical tests are presented to
assess the performance of the developed method. It is shown that the MS-XFEM is
accurate, when compared with the fine-scale reference XFEM solutions. At the
same time, it is significantly more efficient than the XFEM on fine-scale
resolution. As such, it develops the first scalable XFEM method for large-scale

  Data Augmentation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Forecasting models that are trained across sets of many time series, known as
Global Forecasting Models (GFM), have shown recently promising results in
forecasting competitions and real-world applications, outperforming many
state-of-the-art univariate forecasting techniques. In most cases, GFMs are
implemented using deep neural networks, and in particular Recurrent Neural
Networks (RNN), which require a sufficient amount of time series to estimate
their numerous model parameters. However, many time series databases have only
a limited number of time series. In this study, we propose a novel, data
augmentation based forecasting framework that is capable of improving the
baseline accuracy of the GFM models in less data-abundant settings. We use
three time series augmentation techniques: GRATIS, moving block bootstrap
(MBB), and dynamic time warping barycentric averaging (DBA) to synthetically
generate a collection of time series. The knowledge acquired from these
augmented time series is then transferred to the original dataset using two
different approaches: the pooled approach and the transfer learning approach.
When building GFMs, in the pooled approach, we train a model on the augmented
time series alongside the original time series dataset, whereas in the transfer
learning approach, we adapt a pre-trained model to the new dataset. In our
evaluation on competition and real-world time series datasets, our proposed
variants can significantly improve the baseline accuracy of GFM models and
outperform state-of-the-art univariate forecasting methods.

to the planar 3-body problem as well as instabilities, chaos and ergodicity in
the 3-rotor problem.
  Trajectories of the planar 3-body problem are expressed as geodesics of the
Jacobi-Maupertuis (JM) metric on the configuration space $C^3$. Translation,
rotation and scaling isometries lead to reduced dynamics on quotients of $C^3$
that encode information on the full dynamics. Riemannian submersions are used
to find the quotient metrics and to show that the geodesic formulation
regularizes collisions for the $1/r^2$ but not for the $1/r$ potential.
Extending work of Montgomery, we show the negativity of the scalar curvature on
the center of mass configuration space and certain quotients for equal masses
and zero energy. Sectional curvatures are also found to be largely negative
indicating widespread geodesic instabilities.
  In the 3-rotor problem, 3 equal masses move on a circle subject to attractive
cosine inter-particle potentials. This problem arises as the classical limit of
a model of coupled Josephson junctions. The energy E serves as a control
parameter. We find analogues of the Euler-Lagrange family of periodic
solutions: pendula and breathers at all E and choreographies up to moderate E.
The model displays order-chaos-order behavior and undergoes a fairly sharp
transition to chaos at a critical energy E$_c$ with several manifestations: (a)
a dramatic rise in the fraction of Poincar\'e surfaces occupied by chaotic
sections, (b) spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries, (c) a geometric
cascade of stability transitions in pendula and (d) a change in the sign of the
JM curvature. Poincar\'e sections indicate global chaos in a band of energies
slightly above E$_c$ where we provide evidence for ergodicity and mixing with
respect to the Liouville measure and study the statistics of recurrence times.

equivariance, is a challenging constraint for most neural architectures. While
recent work has proposed global pooling and attention-based solutions, these

Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) is a well-known method to find a Nash
equilibrium strategy in a two-player zero-sum game with imperfect information.
The CFR method adopts a regret matching algorithm iteratively to reduce regret
values progressively, enabling the average strategy to approach a Nash
equilibrium. Although CFR-based methods have achieved significant success in
the field of imperfect information games, there is still scope for improvement
in the efficiency of convergence. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
CFR-based method named exponential counterfactual regret minimization (ECFR).
With ECFR, an exponential weighting technique is used to reweight the
instantaneous regret value during the process of iteration. A theoretical proof
is provided to guarantees convergence of the ECFR algorithm. The result of an
extensive set of experimental tests demostrate that the ECFR algorithm
converges faster than the current state-of-the-art CFR-based methods.

for evading some of the well-known singularity theorems by using their

symmetric, (locally) static four dimensional regular black hole solutions are
described from both an analytical and a topological point of view. While the
finiteness of both the scalar and Kretchmann curvature of the slices around the
regular center determines the geometry of the core, the positive answer to the
Poincar\'e conjecture assures that, under two assumptions, its topology is that
of a three-sphere. However, in general, the cores are shown to be $S^3$, $H^3$,
$\mathbb{R}\times S^1$ or $S^1\times S^2$, depending whether a de Sitter, anti
de Sitter, Nariai or Bertotti-Robinson geometries are employed to describe the
slices at the regular center. Then, a description of the aforementioned slices
in terms of Seifert fibre spaces is given in order to show that the Euler
characteristic of the bundle can be used to track the transition between the
core of the regular black hole and the rest of the slices in most of the cases
considered in the literature. After Geroch and Tipler's theorems are employed
to study the consequences of topology change on regular black hole spacetimes,
we show that Borde and Vilenkin's singularity theorem is used to restrict their

recognition performed in complex acoustic scenarios, e.g., noisy environments.
It is required to explore an effective audio-visual fusion strategy for
audiovisual alignment and modality reliability. Different from the previous
end-to-end approaches where the audio-visual fusion is performed after encoding
each modality, in this paper we propose to integrate an attentive fusion block
into the encoding process. It is shown that the proposed audio-visual fusion
method in the encoder module can enrich audio-visual representations, as the
relevance between the two modalities is leveraged. In line with the
transformer-based architecture, we implement the embedded fusion block using a
multi-head attention based audiovisual fusion with one-way or two-way
interactions. The proposed method can sufficiently combine the two streams and
weaken the over-reliance on the audio modality. Experiments on the LRS3-TED
dataset demonstrate that the proposed method can increase the recognition rate
by 0.55%, 4.51% and 4.61% on average under the clean, seen and unseen noise
conditions, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art approach.

To investigate the role of acoustic and magneto-acoustic waves in
heating the solar chromosphere, observations in strong chromospheric lines are
analyzed by comparing the deposited acoustic-energy flux with the total
integrated radiative losses.
  Methods. Quiet-Sun and weak-plage regions were observed in the Ca II 854.2 nm
and H-alpha lines with the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph (FISS) at the 1.6-m
Goode Solar Telescope (GST) on 2019 October 3 and in the H-alpha and H-beta
lines with the echelle spectrograph attached to the Vacuum Tower Telescope
(VTT) on 2018 December 11 and 2019 June 6. The deposited acoustic energy flux
at frequencies up to 20 mHz was derived from Doppler velocities observed in
line centers and wings. Radiative losses were computed by means of a set of
scaled non-LTE 1D hydrostatic semi-empirical models obtained by fitting
synthetic to observed line profiles.
  Results. In the middle chromosphere (h = 1000-1400 km), the radiative losses
can be fully balanced by the deposited acoustic energy flux in a quiet-Sun
region. In the upper chromosphere (h > 1400 km), the deposited acoustic flux is
small compared to the radiative losses in quiet as well as in plage regions.
The crucial parameter determining the amount of deposited acoustic flux is the
gas density at a given height.
  Conclusions. The acoustic energy flux is efficiently deposited in the middle
chromosphere, where the density of gas is sufficiently high. About 90% of the
available acoustic energy flux in the quiet-Sun region is deposited in these
layers, and thus it is a major contributor to the radiative losses of the
middle chromosphere. In the upper chromosphere, the deposited acoustic flux is
too low, so that other heating mechanisms have to act to balance the radiative
cooling.

schemes control phase activation or duration. Yet, such approaches may bypass
low volume links for several cycles in order to optimize the network-level

arterial coordination while maintaining phase order and timing predictability.
Using a validated and calibrated traffic model, we trained the policy of a deep
RL agent that aims to reduce travel delays in the network. We evaluated the
resulting policy by comparing its performance against the phase offsets
deployed along a segment of Huntington Drive in the city of Arcadia. The
resulting policy dynamically readjusts phase offsets in response to changes in
traffic demand. Simulation results show that the proposed deep RL agent
outperformed the baseline on average, effectively reducing delay time by 13.21%

closely follows a power law over almost three orders of magnitude in frequency,
with a spectral index of $\alpha_{\rm 58\,MHz}^{\rm 18.6\,GHz}=-1.16\pm0.03$.
Our finding is consistent with a power-law injection spectrum, as predicted by
diffusive shock acceleration theory. The result suggests that there is only
little magnetic field strength evolution downstream to the shock. From the lack
of spectral steepening, we find that either the Sunyaev-Zeldovich decrement
produced by the pressure jump is less extended than $\sim$ 600\,kpc along the
line of sight or, conversely, that the relic is located far behind in the
cluster. For the first time, we detect linearly polarized emission from the

brush increases at 18.6 GHz, suggesting a strong Faraday depolarization towards
lower frequencies. The observed depolarization is consistent with an
intervening magnetized screen that arise from the dense ICM containing
turbulent magnetic fields. The depolarization, corresponding to a standard
deviation of the Rotation Measures as high as $\sigma_{\rm RM}= 212\pm23\rm

findings indicate that the Toothbrush can be consistently explained by the

transmit their data according to a schedule and move to the doze state
afterwards. The main problem of this mechanism is the clock drift phenomenon,
because of which the devices cease to strictly comply with the schedule. As a
result, they can miss the scheduled transmission time, which increases active
time and thus power consumption. The paper investigates uplink transmission
with two different TWT operation modes. With the first mode, a sensor transmits
a packet to the access point (AP) after waking up, using the random channel
access. With the second mode, the AP polls stations and they can transmit a
packet only after receiving a trigger frame from the AP. For both modes, the
paper studies how the average transmission time, the packet loss rate and the
average energy consumption depend on the different TWT parameters. It is shown
that when configured to guarantee the given packet loss rate, the first mode
provides lower transmission time, while the second mode provides lower energy

essential but challenging task in the computer-aided diagnosis of

myriad number of densely annotated training images, which are difficult to
obtain due to extensive labor and associated expert costs related to histology
image annotations. In this paper, we propose the pairwise relation-based
semi-supervised (PRS^2) model for gland segmentation on histology images. This
model consists of a segmentation network (S-Net) and a pairwise relation
network (PR-Net). The S-Net is trained on labeled data for segmentation, and
PR-Net is trained on both labeled and unlabeled data in an unsupervised way to
enhance its image representation ability via exploiting the semantic
consistency between each pair of images in the feature space. Since both
networks share their encoders, the image representation ability learned by
PR-Net can be transferred to S-Net to improve its segmentation performance. We
also design the object-level Dice loss to address the issues caused by touching
glands and combine it with other two loss functions for S-Net. We evaluated our
model against five recent methods on the GlaS dataset and three recent methods
on the CRAG dataset. Our results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed PR-Net and object-level Dice loss, but also indicate that our PRS^2

quiescent periods? This is a fundamental question for storage and release
models of flares and ARs, yet it is presently poorly answered by observations.
Here we use the ""Sun-as-a-point-source"" spectra from the EUV Variability
Experiment (EVE) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) to provide a novel
estimate of radiative energy losses of an evolving active region. Although EVE
provides excellent spectral (5-105nm) and temperature (2-25MK) coverage for AR
analysis, to our knowledge, these data have not been used for this purpose due
to the lack of spatial resolution and the likelihood of source confusion. Here
we present a way around this problem. We analyze EVE data time series, when
only one large AR 11520 was present on the disk. By subtracting the quiet Sun
background, we estimate the radiative contribution in EUV from the AR alone. We
estimate the mean AR irradiance and cumulative AR radiative energy losses in
the 1-300A and astronomical standard ROSAT-PSPC, 3-124A, passbands and compare
these to the magnetic energy injection rate through the photosphere, and to
variations of the solar cycle luminosity. We find that while AR radiative
energy losses are ~100 times smaller than typical magnetic energy injection
rates at the photosphere, they are an order of magnitude larger or similar to
the bolometric radiated energies associated with large flares. This study is
the first detailed analysis of AR thermal properties using EVE Sun-as-a-star
observations, opening doors to AR studies on other stars.

a posttreatment intermediate variable between a treatment and an outcome, in
which the principal strata are defined by the joint potential values of the
intermediate variable. Because the principal strata are not fully observable,
the causal effects within them, also known as the principal causal effects, are
not identifiable without additional assumptions. Several previous empirical
studies leveraged auxiliary variables to improve the inference of principal
causal effects. We establish a general theory for identification and estimation
of the principal causal effects with auxiliary variables, which provides a
solid foundation for statistical inference and more insights for model building
in empirical research. In particular, we consider two commonly-used strategies
for principal stratification problems: principal ignorability, and the
conditional independence between the auxiliary variable and the outcome given
principal strata and covariates. For these two strategies, we give
non-parametric and semi-parametric identification results without modeling
assumptions on the outcome. When the assumptions for neither strategies are
plausible, we propose a large class of flexible parametric and semi-parametric
models for identifying principal causal effects. Our theory not only
establishes formal identification results of several models that have been used
in previous empirical studies but also generalizes them to allow for different
types of outcomes and intermediate variables.

an open quantum system evolution is used to obtain second law-like
inequalities. We discuss this first for generic quantum systems in contact with
a thermal bath and subsequently turn to a formulation suitable for the
description of local dynamics in a relativistic quantum field theory. A local
version of the second law similar to the one used in relativistic fluid

outlook towards isolated quantum field theories and discuss the role of
entanglement for relativistic fluid dynamics.

reconstructing various hadronic charmed $B$-meson decays with flavor-specific
final states. We use simulation to optimize our event selection criteria and to
train the flavor tagging algorithm. We determine the tagging efficiency and the
fraction of wrongly identified tag-side $B$~candidates from a measurement of
the time-integrated $B^0-\overline{B}^0$ mixing probability. The total
effective efficiency is measured to be $\varepsilon_{\rm eff} = \big(33.8 \pm

the predictions from simulation and comparable with the best one obtained by

  proof-of-concept application of reinforcement learning to medical images",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: AI in radiology is hindered chiefly by: 1) Requiring large annotated
data sets. 2) Non-generalizability that limits deployment to new scanners /
institutions. And 3) Inadequate explainability and interpretability. We believe
that reinforcement learning can address all three shortcomings, with robust and
intuitive algorithms trainable on small datasets. To the best of our knowledge,
reinforcement learning has not been directly applied to computer vision tasks
for radiological images. In this proof-of-principle work, we train a deep
reinforcement learning network to predict brain tumor location.
  Materials and Methods: Using the BraTS brain tumor imaging database, we
trained a deep Q network on 70 post-contrast T1-weighted 2D image slices. We
did so in concert with image exploration, with rewards and punishments designed
to localize lesions. To compare with supervised deep learning, we trained a
keypoint detection convolutional neural network on the same 70 images. We
applied both approaches to a separate 30 image testing set.
  Results: Reinforcement learning predictions consistently improved during
training, whereas those of supervised deep learning quickly diverged.
Reinforcement learning predicted testing set lesion locations with 85%
accuracy, compared to roughly 7% accuracy for the supervised deep network.
  Conclusion: Reinforcement learning predicted lesions with high accuracy,
which is unprecedented for such a small training set. We believe that
reinforcement learning can propel radiology AI well past the inherent
limitations of supervised deep learning, with more clinician-driven research
and finally toward true clinical applicability.

distribute their wealth or debt proportionally to the transition probabilities
of the Markov chain; the stationary probability of a node is computed as a
ratio of the cash distributed by this node to the total cash distributed by all

very different, and previously disconnected methods including power iterations,
Gauss-Southwell, and online distributed algorithms. We prove exponential
convergence of our method, demonstrate its high efficiency, and derive

for model training. However, trimmed datasets are manually annotated from

In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised method, referred to as
Exploring Relations in Untrimmed Videos (ERUV), which can be straightforwardly
applied to untrimmed videos (real unlabeled) to learn spatio-temporal features.
ERUV first generates single-shot videos by shot change detection. Then a
designed sampling strategy is used to model relations for video clips. The
strategy is saved as our self-supervision signals. Finally, the network learns
representations by predicting the category of relations between the video
clips. ERUV is able to compare the differences and similarities of videos,
which is also an essential procedure for action and video related tasks. We
validate our learned models with action recognition and video retrieval tasks
with three kinds of 3D CNNs. Experimental results show that ERUV is able to
learn richer representations and it outperforms state-of-the-art
self-supervised methods with significant margins.

  Adversarial Network","Accepted by TNNLS 2021",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Heterogeneous domain adaptation (HDA) tackles the learning of cross-domain
samples with both different probability distributions and feature
representations. Most of the existing HDA studies focus on the single-source
scenario. In reality, however, it is not uncommon to obtain samples from
multiple heterogeneous domains. In this article, we study the multisource HDA
problem and propose a conditional weighting adversarial network (CWAN) to
address it. The proposed CWAN adversarially learns a feature transformer, a
label classifier, and a domain discriminator. To quantify the importance of
different source domains, CWAN introduces a sophisticated conditional weighting
scheme to calculate the weights of the source domains according to the
conditional distribution divergence between the source and target domains.
Different from existing weighting schemes, the proposed conditional weighting
scheme not only weights the source domains but also implicitly aligns the
conditional distributions during the optimization process. Experimental results
clearly demonstrate that the proposed CWAN performs much better than several
state-of-the-art methods on four real-world datasets.

the first large-scale experiment to truly test and successfully demonstrate its
potential when applied recursively, which is when it leads to the stated
complexity. It required the equivalent of about 2900 core years on a single
core of an Intel Xeon Ivy Bridge processor running at 2.6 GHz, which is
comparable to the approximately 3100 core years expended for the discrete
logarithm record for prime fields, set in a field of bit-length 795, and
demonstrates just how much easier the problem is for this level of
computational effort. In order to make the computation feasible we introduced
several innovative techniques for the elimination of small degree irreducible
elements, which meant that we avoided performing any costly Gr\""obner basis
computations, in contrast to all previous records since early 2013. While such
computations are crucial to the $L(\frac 1 4 + o(1))$ complexity algorithms,
they were simply too slow for our purposes. Finally, this computation should
serve as a serious deterrent to cryptographers who are still proposing to rely
on the discrete logarithm security of such finite fields in applications,
despite the existence of two quasi-polynomial algorithms and the prospect of
even faster algorithms being developed.

organic disk-like molecules that form cylindrical aggregates. Despite the
growing interest in these materials, their flow behavior is poorly understood.
Here, we explore the effect of shear on dynamic structures of the nematic LCLC,
formed by 14wt ${\%}$ water dispersion of disodium cromoglycate (DSCG). We
employ in-situ polarizing optical microscopy (POM) and small-angle and
wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS/WAXS) to obtain independent and complementary
information on the director structures over a wide range of shear rates. The
DSCG nematic shows a shear-thinning behavior with two shear-thinning regions
(Region I at $\dot{\gamma}<1\,s^{-1}$ and Region III at $\dot{\gamma}>10
s^{-1}$) separated by a pseudo-Newtonian Region II ($1 s^{-1}<\dot{\gamma}<10
s^{-1}$). The material is of a tumbling type. In Region I, $\dot{\gamma}<1
s^{-1}$, the director realigns along the vorticity axis. An increase of
$\dot{\gamma}$ above $1 s^{-1}$ triggers nucleation of disclination loops. The
disclinations introduce patches of the director that deviates from the
vorticity direction and form a polydomain texture. Extension of the domains
along the flow and along the vorticity direction decreases with the increase of
the shear rate to $10 s^{-1}$. Above $10 s^{-1}$, the domains begin to elongate
along the flow. At $\dot{\gamma}>100 s^{-1}$, the texture evolves into periodic
stripes in which the director is predominantly along the flow with left and
right tilts. The period of stripes decreases with an increase of
$\dot{\gamma}$. The shear-induced transformations are explained by the balance
of the elastic and viscous energies. In particular, nucleation of disclinations
is associated with an increase of the elastic energy at the walls separating
nonsingular domains with different director tilts.

time-varying matrix problems and Zeroing Neural Networks in the West. Zeroing
Neural Networks (ZNN) were invented for time-varying matrix problems around
2001 in China and almost all of their advances have been made in and most still
come from its birthplace. ZNN methods have become a backbone for solving
discretized sensor driven time-varying matrix problems in real-time, in theory
and in on-chip applications for robots, in control theory and in engineering in
China. They have become the method of choice for many time-varying matrix
problems that benefit from or require efficient, accurate and predictive
real-time computations. The typical discretized ZNN algorithm needs seven
distinct steps for its initial set-up. The construction of discretized ZNN
algorithms starts from a model with its associated error equation and the
stipulation that the error function decrease exponentially fast. The error
function differential equation is then mated with a convergent look-ahead
finite difference formula to create a distinctly new multi-step style solver
that predicts the future state of the system reliably from current and earlier
state and solution data. Matlab codes for discretized ZNN matrix algorithms
typically consist of one linear equations solve and one recursion of already
available data per time step. This makes discretized ZNN based algorithms
highly competitive with ordinary differential equation initial value path
following or homotopy methods that are designed to work adaptively and gives
ZNN different characteristics and applicabilities from multi-step ODE initial
value solvers that by design cannot be predictive. Discretized ZNN time-varying
matrix methods can solve problems given by sensor data with constant sampling
gaps or from functional equations.

in this testing strategy. A generally accepted method to validate these sensor

In this paper, we introduce a sensitivity analysis approach for developing and
evaluating a radar simulation, with the objective to identify the parameters
with the greatest impact regarding the system under test. A modular radar
system simulation is presented and parameterized to conduct a sensitivity
analysis in order to evaluate a spatial clustering algorithm as the system

measurements to ensure a realistic model behavior. The presented approach is
evaluated and it is demonstrated that with this approach results from different

while such an emission is completely absent in the BCS-limit. In the
crossover-regime, the instability and phonon emission are enhanced, and the
lifetime of a doubly-quantized vortex becomes minimal. The emitted phonon is
amplified due to the rotational superradiance and can be observed as a
spiraling pattern in the superfluid. We also investigate the influence of
temperature, population imbalance, and three-dimensional effects.

However, the collected projection based on the 2*2 acquisition mode has low
resolution (LR) and the reconstructed image quality is poor, thus limiting the
use of this mode in CT imaging systems. In this study, a novel
sinogram-super-resolution generative adversarial network (SSR-GAN) model is
proposed to obtain high-resolution (HR) sinograms from LR sinograms, thereby
improving the reconstruction image quality under the 2*2 acquisition mode. The
proposed generator is based on the residual network for LR sinogram feature
extraction and super-resolution (SR) sinogram generation. A relativistic
discriminator is designed to render the network capable of obtaining more
realistic SR sinograms. Moreover, we combine the cycle consistency loss,
sinogram domain loss, and reconstruction image domain loss in the total loss
function to supervise SR sinogram generation. Then, a trained model can be
obtained by inputting the paired LR/HR sinograms into the network. Finally, the
classic FBP reconstruction algorithm is used for CT image reconstruction based
on the generated SR sinogram. The qualitative and quantitative results of
evaluations on digital and real data illustrate that the proposed model not
only obtains clean SR sinograms from noisy LR sinograms but also outperforms
its counterparts.

WaveGlow inference results in synthesized speech. We compare the proposed

voiced/unvoiced decision when predicting F0. The results demonstrate that
during the articulatory-to-acoustic mapping experiments, the WaveGlow neural
vocoder produces significantly more natural synthesized speech than the
baseline system. Besides, the advantage of WaveGlow is that F0 is included in
the mel-spectrogram representation, and it is not necessary to predict the

sexual networks only use sexual activity data, such as the number of partners
per month, to generate the sexual network. Real-world sexual networks also
depend on biased mixing based on age, location, and social and work activities.
We describe an approach to use a broad range of social activity data to
generate possible heterosexual networks. We start with a large-scale simulation
of thousands of people in a city as they go through their daily activities,
including work, school, shopping, and activities at home. We extract a social
network from these activities where the nodes are the people and the edges
indicate a social interaction, such as working in the same location. This
social network captures the correlations between people of different ages,
living in different locations, their economic status, and other demographic
factors. We use the social contact network to define a bipartite heterosexual
network that is embedded within an extended social network. The resulting
sexual network captures the biased mixing inherent in the social network, and
models based on this pairing of networks can be used to investigate novel
intervention strategies based on the social contacts of infected people. We
illustrate the approach in a model for the spread of Chlamydia in the

popular LSH (locality sensitive hashing) algorithm, which is generally
implemented on a single machine. We show how we can append the LSH algorithm
with heavy hitters sketches to provably solve the (high) similarity search
problem without a single distance computation. Overall, we mathematically show
that, under realistic data assumptions, we can identify the near-neighbor of a
given query $q$ in sub-linear ($ \ll O(n)$) number of simple sketch aggregation
operations only. To make such a system practical, we offer a novel design and
sketching solution to reduce the inter-machine communication overheads
exponentially. In a direct comparison on comparable hardware, SLASH is more
than 10000x faster than the popular LSH package in PySpark. PySpark is a
widely-adopted distributed implementation of the LSH algorithm for large
datasets and is deployed in commercial platforms. In the end, we show how our
system scale to Tera-scale Criteo dataset with more than 4 billion samples.
SLASH can index this 2.3 terabyte data over 20 nodes in under an hour, with

is no open-source system that can index and perform a similarity search on
Criteo with a commodity cluster.

study both chaotic and non-chaotic phenomena in the context of quantum
statistical mechanics. In this paper, we define a general class of OTOC, which
can perfectly capture quantum randomness phenomena in a better way. Further we
demonstrate an equivalent formalism of computation using a general time
independent Hamiltonian having well defined eigenstate representation for
integrable supersymmetric quantum systems. We found that one needs to consider
two new correlators apart from the usual one to have a complete quantum
description. To visualize the impact of the given formalism we consider the two
well known models viz. Harmonic Oscillator and one dimensional potential well
within the framework of supersymmetry. For the Harmonic Oscillator case we
obtain similar periodic time dependence but dissimilar parameter dependences
compared to the results obtained from both micro-canonical and canonical
ensembles in quantum mechanics without supersymmetry. On the other hand, for
one dimensional potential well problem we found significantly different time
scale and the other parameter dependence compared to the results obtained from
non-supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Finally, to establish the consistency of
the prescribed formalism in the classical limit, we demonstrate the phase space
averaged version of the classical version of OTOCs from a model independent

simple partial integro-differential equation, to explain how frictional
abrasion alone of a stone on a planar beach can lead to the oval shapes
observed empirically. The underlying idea in this theory is the intuitive
observation that the rate of ablation at a point on the surface of the stone is
proportional to the product of the curvature of the stone at that point and how
often the stone is likely to be in contact with the beach at that point.
Specifically, key roles in this new model are played by both the random wave
process and the global (non-local) shape of the stone, i.e., its shape away
from the point of contact with the beach. The underlying physical mechanism for
this process is the conversion of energy from the wave process into potential
energy of the stone. No closed-form or even asymptotic solution is known for
the basic equation, even in a 2-dimensional setting, but basic numerical
solutions are presented in both the deterministic continuous-time setting using
standard curve-shortening algorithms, and a stochastic discrete-time
polyhedral-slicing setting using Monte Carlo simulation.

uncertain and often involve multiple growth phases. The logistic-sigmoid
function has been suggested and applied in the domain of modelling such growth
processes. However, existing definitions are limiting, as they do not consider
growth as restricted in two-dimension. Additionally, as the number of growth
phases increase, the modelling and estimation of logistic parameters becomes
more cumbersome, requiring more complex tools and analysis. To remedy this, we
introduce the nlogistic-sigmoid function as a compact, unified modern
definition of logistic growth for modelling such real-world growth phenomena.
Also, we introduce two characteristic metrics of the logistic-sigmoid curve
that can give more robust projections on the state of the growth process in
each dimension. Specifically, we apply this function to modelling the daily
World Health Organization published COVID-19 time-series data of infection and
death cases of the world and countries of the world to date. Our results
demonstrate statistically significant goodness of fit greater than or equal to
99% for affected countries of the world exhibiting patterns of either single or
multiple stages of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, such as the USA.
Consequently, this modern logistic definition and its metrics, as a machine
learning tool, can help to provide clearer and more robust monitoring and
quantification of the ongoing pandemic growth process.

are two fold: (i) to train students in setting up Newton's equations of motion
by identifying force components and equating to the corresponding mass times
accelerations and (ii) to make the students familiar with the expressions for
acceleration in the polar coordinates that we introduce at the beginning of the
course. After guiding them through the solution which predicts an eventual
radially outward motion for the bead (except for a very special initial
condition), a typical question that gets asked is the following: The math is
all fine sir, but how does the bead that is initially at rest at some point on
the rod manage to move radially out if there are no radial forces? This article
is about the ways I have tried to answer this question over the years and help

model parameters to agree with survey data showing Ct prevalence of 12% of the
women and 10% of the men in the 15-25 year-old AA in New Orleans, Louisiana.
Our model accounts for long-term and casual partnerships. The network captures
assortative mixing of individuals by preserving the joint-degree distributions
observed in the data. We compare the efficiency of intervention strategies of
randomly screening men, partner notification, which includes partner treatment,
partner screening, and rescreening for infection. We compare the difference
between treating partners of an infected person both with and without testing
them. We observe that although increased Ct screening, rescreening and treating
most of the partners of infected people will reduce the prevalence, these
mitigations alone are not sufficient to control the epidemic. The current
practice is to treat the partners of an infected individual, without first
testing them for infection. The model predicts that if a sufficient number of
the partners of all infected people are tested and treated, then there is a
threshold condition where the epidemic can be mitigated. This threshold results
from the expanded treatment network created by treating the partners of the
infected partners of an individual. Although these conclusions can help design
future Ct mitigation studies, we caution the reader that these conclusions are
for the mathematical model, not the real world, and are contingent on the
validity of the model assumptions.

wettability change, in turn, alters the dynamics of relative permeabilities at

permeabilities is essential to understand fluids interaction in porous media.
In this study, we include time-dependent wettability change into the relative
permeability--saturation relation by modifying the existing relative

represented by the sorption-based model that is exposure time and chemistry

  Locomotion",,,,,"cs.RO cs.AI cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modern Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms promise to solve difficult
motor control problems directly from raw sensory inputs. Their attraction is
due in part to the fact that they can represent a general class of methods that
allow to learn a solution with a reasonably set reward and minimal prior
knowledge, even in situations where it is difficult or expensive for a human
expert. For RL to truly make good on this promise, however, we need algorithms
and learning setups that can work across a broad range of problems with minimal
problem specific adjustments or engineering. In this paper, we study this idea
of generality in the locomotion domain. We develop a learning framework that
can learn sophisticated locomotion behavior for a wide spectrum of legged
robots, such as bipeds, tripeds, quadrupeds and hexapods, including wheeled
variants. Our learning framework relies on a data-efficient, off-policy
multi-task RL algorithm and a small set of reward functions that are
semantically identical across robots. To underline the general applicability of
the method, we keep the hyper-parameter settings and reward definitions
constant across experiments and rely exclusively on on-board sensing. For nine
different types of robots, including a real-world quadruped robot, we
demonstrate that the same algorithm can rapidly learn diverse and reusable
locomotion skills without any platform specific adjustments or additional
instrumentation of the learning setup.

  Recurrent Neural Network","74 pages, Thesis",,,,"cs.CL cs.SI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sentiment Analysis is the task of classifying documents based on the
sentiments expressed in textual form, this can be achieved by using lexical and
semantic methods. The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of
semantics to perform sentiment analysis based on probabilistic graphical models
and recurrent neural networks. In the empirical evaluation, the classification
performance of the graphical models was compared with some traditional machine
learning classifiers and a recurrent neural network. The datasets used for the
experiments were IMDB movie reviews, Amazon Consumer Product reviews, and
Twitter Review datasets. After this empirical study, we conclude that the
inclusion of semantics for sentiment analysis tasks can greatly improve the
performance of a classifier, as the semantic feature extraction methods reduce
uncertainties in classification resulting in more accurate predictions.

  electrolytic method",,,,,"cond-mat.mtrl-sci physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The old creation method of this coating is using salt bath for an approximate
time of 6 to 10 hours, which means wasting a lot of time and energy while the
formation of this coating with the plasma electrolytic method just takes about
15 minutes and it can increase the efficiency strongly on an industrial scale.
In this research, the process has been applied on the samples of 1.2436 steel
in different periods. Then, thickness of the coating layers has been measured
by using SEM images and thermodynamic data of Vanadium carbide formation. These
results have been expanded to access and present a confirmed model to predict
the thickness of this diffusion-based coating as a function of time and
reaction temperature. The proven model can be used to demonstrate and prove the
kinetic advantage of this method and also find the optimal value of applying
time and temperature.

respiratory diseases. Early COVID-19 outbreaks in Wuhan, China and Lombardy,
Italy coincided with high levels of air pollution drawing attention to a
potential role of particulate matter and other pollutants in infections and
more severe outcomes of the new lung disease. Both air pollution and COVID-19
outcomes are driven by human mobility and economic activity leading to spurious
correlations in regression estimates. We use district-level panel data from
Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Italy, the UK, and the US to estimate the impact of
daily variation in air pollution levels on COVID-19 infections and deaths.
Using random variation in air pollution generated by thermal inversions, we
rule out that changes in mobility and economic activity are driving the
results. We find that a 1%-increase in air pollution levels over the three
preceding weeks leads to a 1.5% increase in weekly cases. A 1%-increase in air
pollution over four weeks leads to 5.1% more COVID-19 deaths. These results
indicate that short-term measures to reduce air pollution can help mitigate the
health damages of the virus.
