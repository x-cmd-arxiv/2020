pathogens contain asymptomatic phenotypes amongst their ranks, as evident
during the recent COVID-19 pandemic. Spreading of diseases has been studied
extensively under the paradigm of Susceptible - Infected - Recovered - Deceased
(SIRD) dynamics. Various game-theoretic approaches have also addressed disease
spread, many of which consider S, I, R, and D as strategies rather than as
states. Remarkably, most studies from the above approaches do not account for
the distinction between the symptomatic or asymptomatic aspect of the disease.
It is well-known that precautionary measures like washing hands, wearing masks
and social distancing significantly mitigate the spread of many contagious
diseases. Herein, we consider the adoption of such precautions as strategies
and treat S, I, R, and D as states. We also attempt to capture the differences
in epidemic spreading arising from symptomatic and asymptomatic diseases on
various network topologies. Through extensive computer simulations, we examine
that the cost of maintaining precautionary measures as well as the extent of
mass testing in a population affects the final fraction of socially responsible
individuals. We observe that the lack of mass testing could potentially lead to
a pandemic in case of asymptomatic diseases. Network topology also seems to
play an important role. We further observe that the final fraction of proactive
individuals depends on the initial fraction of both infected as well as
proactive individuals. Additionally, edge density can significantly influence
the overall outcome. Our findings are in broad agreement with the lessons
learnt from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

can be difficult with the inclusion of capacity-based grid tariffs. Scheduling
the building based on a proposed measured-peak (MP) grid tariff, which is a
cost based on the highest peak power over a period, requires the user to
consider the impact the current decision-making has in the future. Therefore,
the authors propose a mathematical model using stochastic dynamic programming
(SDP) that tries to represent the long-term impact of current decision-making.
The SDP algorithm calculates non-linear expected future cost curves (EFCC) for
the building based on the peak power backwards for each day over a month. The
uncertainty in load demand and weather are considered using a discrete Markov
chain setup. The model is applied to a case study for a Norwegian building with
smart control of flexible loads, and compared against methods where the MP grid
tariff is not accurately represented, and where the user has perfect
information of the whole month. The results showed that the SDP algorithm
performs 0.3 % better than a scenario with no accurate way of presenting future
impacts, and performs 3.6 % worse compared to a scenario where the user had
perfect information.

address this problem, HO skipping techniques have been studied in recent years.
In this paper, we propose a novel HO skipping scheme, namely, time-based HO
skipping. In the proposed scheme, HOs of a user are controlled by a certain
fixed period of time, which we call skipping time. The skipping time can be
managed as a system parameter, thereby enabling flexible operation of HO
skipping. We analyze the transmission performance of the proposed scheme on the

the time-based HO skipping, we derive the analytical expressions for two
performance metrics: the HO rate and the expected data rate. The analysis
results demonstrate that the scenario with the time-based HO skipping
outperforms the scenario without HO skipping particularly when the user moves

in the two-fluid description. Previously, numerical codes were unable to
incorporate streaming in this demanding regime, and have never been compared
against analytic solutions. First, we find a new analytic solution highly
discrepant in acceleration efficiency from the standard solution. It arises
from bi-directional streaming of CRs away from the subshock, similar to a
Zeldovich spike in radiative shocks. Since fewer CRs diffuse back upstream,
this results in a much lower acceleration efficiency, typically $\sim 10\%$ as
opposed to $\sim 50\%$ found in previous analytic work. At Mach number $\gtrsim
10$, the new solution bifurcates into 3 branches, with efficient, intermediate
and inefficient CR acceleration. Our two-moment code (Jiang & Oh 2018)
accurately recovers these solutions across the entire parameter space probed,
with no ad hoc closure relations. For generic initial conditions, the
inefficient branch is the most robust and preferred solution. The intermediate
branch is unstable, while the efficient branch appears only when the
inefficient branch is not allowed (for CR dominated or high plasma $\beta$
shocks). CR modified shocks have very long equilibration times ($\sim 1000$
diffusion time) required to develop the precursor, which must be resolved by
$\gtrsim 10$ cells for convergence. Non-equilibrium effects, poor resolution
and obliquity of the magnetic field all reduce CR acceleration efficiency.
Shocks in galaxy scale simulations will generally contribute little to CR
acceleration without a subgrid prescription.

trifecta: large data size $N$; high dimensions; and expensive algorithms. In
this setting, cross-validation (CV) serves as an important tool for model
assessment. Recent advances in approximate cross validation (ACV) provide
accurate approximations to CV with only a single model fit, avoiding
traditional CV's requirement for repeated runs of expensive algorithms.
Unfortunately, these ACV methods can lose both speed and accuracy in high
dimensions -- unless sparsity structure is present in the data. Fortunately,
there is an alternative type of simplifying structure that is present in most
data: approximate low rank (ALR). Guided by this observation, we develop a new
algorithm for ACV that is fast and accurate in the presence of ALR data. Our
first key insight is that the Hessian matrix -- whose inverse forms the
computational bottleneck of existing ACV methods -- is ALR. We show that,
despite our use of the \emph{inverse} Hessian, a low-rank approximation using
the largest (rather than the smallest) matrix eigenvalues enables fast,
reliable ACV. Our second key insight is that, in the presence of ALR data,
error in existing ACV methods roughly grows with the (approximate, low) rank
rather than with the (full, high) dimension. These insights allow us to prove
theoretical guarantees on the quality of our proposed algorithm -- along with
fast-to-compute upper bounds on its error. We demonstrate the speed and
accuracy of our method, as well as the usefulness of our bounds, on a range of

correspond to the same real-world entity. Our goal is to develop a procedure
that samples uniformly from the set of entities present in the database in the
presence of duplicates. We accomplish this by a two-stage process. In the first
step, we estimate the frequencies of all the entities in the database. In the
second step, we use rejection sampling to obtain a (approximately) uniform
sample from the set of entities. However, efficiently estimating the frequency
of all the entities is a non-trivial task and not attainable in the general
case. Hence, we consider various natural properties of the data under which
such frequency estimation (and consequently uniform sampling) is possible.
Under each of those assumptions, we provide sampling algorithms and give proofs
of the complexity (both statistical and computational) of our approach. We
complement our study by conducting extensive experiments on both real and

the incorporation of increasingly many particle density correlations, can
remedy some of the inherent limitations of the ideal mode-coupling theory
(MCT). However, despite MCT's limitations, the ideal theory also enjoys several
remarkable successes, notably including the analytical scaling laws for the
$\alpha$- and $\beta$-relaxation dynamics. Here we mathematically derive
similar scaling laws for arbitrary-order multi-point density correlation
functions obtained from GMCT under arbitrary mean-field closure levels. More
specifically, we analytically derive the asymptotic and preasymptotic solutions
for the long-time limits of multi-point density correlators, the critical
dynamics with two power-law decays, the factorization scaling laws in the
$\beta$-relaxation regime, and the time-density superposition principle in the
$\alpha$-relaxation regime. The two characteristic power-law-divergent
relaxation times for the two-step decay and the non-trivial relation between
their exponents are also obtained. The validity ranges of the leading-order
scaling laws are also provided by considering the leading preasymptotic
corrections. Furthermore, we test these solutions for the Percus-Yevick
hard-sphere system. We demonstrate that GMCT preserves all the celebrated
scaling laws of MCT while quantitatively improving the exponents, rendering the
theory a promising candidate for an ultimately quantitative first-principles

these atoms follow almost constant speed, force-free trajectories. For the ISN
populations, dynamical and ballistic selection effects are important, and times
of flight are much longer. We estimate these times for ISN He and H atoms
observed by IBEX and in the future by IMAP using the WTPM model with synthesis

on the order of three solar cycle periods, with a spread equivalent to one
solar cycle. For the secondary populations, the times of flight are on the

observations, IBEX has been collecting secondary He atoms produced in the OHS

separating a disordered paramagnetic phase from a period doubled phase, the

one-point and two-point correlation functions are obtained within the Gaussian
approximation and perturbatively in the drive amplitude. The correlations are
found to show not only period doubling, but also power-law decays at large
spatial distances. These features are compared with the undriven O(N) model, in
the vicinity of the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic critical point. The algebraic
decays in space are found to be qualitatively different in the driven and the
undriven cases. In particular, the spatio-temporal order of the Floquet time
crystal leads to position-momentum and momentum-momentum correlation functions
which are more long-ranged in the driven than in the undriven model. The
light-cone dynamics associated with the correlation functions is also
qualitatively different as the critical line of the Floquet time crystal shows
a light-cone with two distinct velocities, with the ratio of these two
velocities scaling as the square-root of the dimensionless drive amplitude. The
Floquet unitary, which describes the time evolution due to a complete cycle of
the drive, is constructed for modes with small momenta compared to the drive
frequency, but having a generic relationship with the square-root of the drive
amplitude. At intermediate momenta, which are large compared to the square-root
of the drive amplitude, the Floquet unitary is found to simply rotate the
modes. On the other hand, at momenta which are small compared to the
square-root of the drive amplitude, the Floquet unitary is found to primarily
squeeze the modes, to an extent which increases upon increasing the wavelength
of the modes, with a power-law dependence on it.

the ionized interstellar medium. In addition to the frequency-dependent pulse
times of arrival due to dispersion, pulse shapes are also distorted and
shifted, having been scattered by the inhomogeneous interstellar plasma,
affecting pulse arrival times. Understanding the degree to which scattering
affects pulsar timing is important for gravitational wave detection with pulsar
timing arrays (PTAs), which depend on the reliability of pulsars as stable
clocks with an uncertainty of ~100ns or less over ~10yr or more. Scattering can
be described as a convolution of the intrinsic pulse shape with an impulse
response function representing the effects of multipath propagation. In
previous studies, the technique of cyclic spectroscopy has been applied to
pulsar signals to deconvolve the effects of scattering from the original
emitted signals. We present an analysis of simulated data to test the quality
of deconvolution using cyclic spectroscopy over a range of parameters
characterizing interstellar scattering and pulsar signal-to-noise ratio. We
show that cyclic spectroscopy is most effective for high-S/N and/or highly
scattered pulsars. We conclude that cyclic spectroscopy could play an important
role in scattering correction to distant populations of highly scattered
pulsars not currently included in PTAs. For future telescopes and for current
instruments such as the Green Bank Telescope upgraded with the ultrawide
bandwidth (UWB) receiver, cyclic spectroscopy could potentially double the
number of PTA-quality pulsars.

galaxies in the local Universe, we deliver a census of ultraluminous X-ray
source (ULX) populations in nearby galaxies. We find 629 ULX candidates in 309
galaxies with distance smaller than 40\,Mpc. The foreground/background
contamination is ${\sim}20\%$. The ULX populations in bona-fide star-forming
galaxies scale on average with star-formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass
($M_\star$) such that the number of ULXs per galaxy is
$0.45^{+0.06}_{-0.09}\times\frac{\rm SFR}{\rm
M_\odot\,yr^{-1}}{+}3.3^{+3.8}_{-3.2}\times\frac{M_\star}{\rm M_\odot}$. The
scaling depends strongly on the morphological type. This analysis shows that
early spiral galaxies contain an additional population of ULXs that scales with
$M_\star$. We also confirm the strong anti-correlation of the ULX rate with the
host galaxy's metallicity. In the case of early-type galaxies we find that
there is a non-linear dependence of the number of ULXs with $M_\star$, which is
interpreted as the result of star-formation history differences. Taking into
account age and metallicity effects, we find that the predictions from X-ray
binary population synthesis models are consistent with the observed ULX rates
in early-type galaxies, as well as, spiral/irregular galaxies.

extensions of this methodology to nonlinear inverse problems have been met with
potentially fundamental sample complexity bottlenecks. In particular, tractable
algorithms for compressive phase retrieval with sparsity priors have not been
able to achieve optimal sample complexity. This has created an open problem in
compressive phase retrieval: under generic, phaseless linear measurements, are
there tractable reconstruction algorithms that succeed with optimal sample
complexity? Meanwhile, progress in machine learning has led to the development
of new data-driven signal priors in the form of generative models, which can
outperform sparsity priors with significantly fewer measurements. In this work,
we resolve the open problem in compressive phase retrieval and demonstrate that
generative priors can lead to a fundamental advance by permitting optimal
sample complexity by a tractable algorithm in this challenging nonlinear
inverse problem. We additionally provide empirics showing that exploiting
generative priors in phase retrieval can significantly outperform sparsity
priors. These results provide support for generative priors as a new paradigm
for signal recovery in a variety of contexts, both empirically and
theoretically. The strengths of this paradigm are that (1) generative priors
can represent some classes of natural signals more concisely than sparsity
priors, (2) generative priors allow for direct optimization over the natural
signal manifold, which is intractable under sparsity priors, and (3) the
resulting non-convex optimization problems with generative priors can admit
benign optimization landscapes at optimal sample complexity, perhaps
surprisingly, even in cases of nonlinear measurements.

optimal lightness in various graph classes, such as general graphs, Euclidean
spanners, and minor-free graphs. Three shortcomings of previous works on light
spanners are: (i) The runtimes of these constructions are almost always
sub-optimal and usually far from optimal. (ii) These constructions are optimal
in the standard and crude sense but not in a refined sense that takes into
account a wider range of involved parameters. (iii) The techniques are ad hoc
per graph class and thus can't be applied broadly.
  This work aims at addressing these shortcomings by presenting a unified
framework of light spanners in a variety of graph classes. Informally, the
framework boils down to a transformation from sparse spanners to light
spanners; since the state-of-the-art for sparse spanners is much more advanced
than that for light spanners, such a transformation is powerful. First, we
apply our framework to design fast constructions with optimal lightness for
several graph classes. Second, we apply our framework to achieve more refined
optimality bounds for several graph classes, i.e., the bounds remain optimal
when taking into account a wider range of involved parameters, most notably
$\epsilon$. Our new constructions are significantly better than the
state-of-the-art for every examined graph class.

client individually, cable plans need to be drawn automatically. The drawings
must be well readable so that technicians can use them to debug the machines.
In order to model plug sockets, we introduce port groups; within a group, ports
can change their position (which we use to improve the aesthetics of the
layout), but together the ports of a group must form a contiguous block.
  We approach the problem of drawing such cable plans by extending the
well-known Sugiyama framework such that it incorporates ports and port groups.
Since the framework assumes directed graphs, we propose several ways to orient
the edges of the given undirected graph. We compare these methods
experimentally, both on real-world data and synthetic data that carefully
simulates real-world data. We measure the aesthetics of the resulting drawings
by counting bends and crossings. Using these metrics, we experimentally compare
our approach to Kieler [JVLC 2014], a library for drawing graphs in the
presence of port constraints. Our method produced 10--30 % fewer crossings,
while it performed equally well or slightly worse than Kieler with respect to
the number of bends and the time used to compute a drawing.

fixed position to estimate the three orientations (roll, tilt, and yaw) and the
horizontal position of the LiDAR attachment with sub-degree and millimeter

that are the closest to each target corner are extracted and used to calculate
the sensor attachment pose with respect to the target board frame using a
nonlinear optimization method and with a low computational cost. The
performance of the proposed method is evaluated using a test bench that can
control the reference yaw and horizontal translation of LiDAR within ranges of
3 degrees and 30 millimeters, respectively. The experimental results for a
low-resolution 16 channel LiDAR (Velodyne VLP-16) confirmed that misalignment
could be estimated with accuracy within 0.2 degrees and 4 mm. The high accuracy

Gregory-Loredo algorithm, which applies Bayes's theorem to the phase-folded
light curve and is well-suited for irregularly sampled X-ray data, we detect 25
periodic signals in 23 discrete sources, among which 15 signals are new
discoveries and two sources show dual periods. The vast majority of the 23
periodic sources are classified as magnetic cataclysmic variables (CVs), based
on their period range, X-ray luminosities, spectral properties, and
phase-folded light curves that are characteristic of spin modulation.
Meanwhile, there is a paucity of non-magnetic CVs seen as periodic sources,
which can be understood as due to a low detection efficiency for eclipsing
sources. Under reasonable assumptions about the geometry of magnetic CVs and a
large set of simulated X-ray light curves, we estimate the fraction of magnetic
CVs in the inner Galactic bulge to be $\lesssim$23%, which is similar to that
in the solar neighborhood. There is an apparent lack of long-period
($\gtrsim$3.3 hours) CVs in the LW, when contrasted with the range of known CVs
in the solar neighborhood. We suggest that this might be an age effect, in the
sense that CVs in the inner bulge are more evolved systems and have

use a patch-based classifier with limited receptive fields to visualize which

to the theory of Yangians is that, for each $c\in \mathbb{C}$, there is an

design of both waveforms is characterized by the ODE Bloch equations, to which
there is no known direct solution. Existing approaches therefore typically rely
on simplified problem formulations based on, e.g., the small-tip approximation
or constraining the gradient waveforms to particular shapes, and often apply
only to specific objective functions for a narrow set of design goals (e.g.,
ignoring hardware constraints). This paper develops and exploits an
auto-differentiable Bloch simulator to directly compute Jacobians of the
(Bloch-simulated) excitation pattern with respect to RF and gradient waveforms.
This approach is compatible with \emph{arbitrary} sub-differentiable loss
functions, and optimizes the RF and gradients directly without restricting the
waveform shapes. For computational efficiency, we derive and implement explicit
Bloch simulator Jacobians (approximately halving computation time and memory
usage). To enforce hardware limits (peak RF, gradient, and slew rate), we use a
change of variables that makes the 3D pulse design problem effectively
unconstrained; we then optimize the resulting problem directly using the
proposed auto-differentiation framework. We demonstrate our approach with two
kinds of 3D excitation pulses that cannot be easily designed with conventional
approaches: Outer-volume saturation (90{\deg} flip angle), and inner-volume
inversion.

These Q-vectors turn out to parameterise a collection of complete flags which
are fused with one another in a particular way. We show that the fused flag is
a finite-difference oper in a particular gauge, explicit identification depends
on a choice of a Coxeter element.
  The paper considers the case of simple Lie algebras with a simply-laced
Dynkin diagram. For the $A_r$ series, the construction coincides with already
known results in the literature. We apply the proposed formalism to the case of
the $D_r$ series and the exceptional algebras $E_r$, $r=6,7,8$. In particular,
we solve Hirota bilinear equations in terms of Q-functions and give the
explicit character solution of the extended Q-system in the $D_r$ case. We also
show how to build up the extended Q-system of $D_r$ type starting either from
vectors, by a procedure similar to the $A_r$ scenario which however constructs
a fused flag of isotropic spaces, or from pure spinors, \via fused Fierz
relations.
  Finally, for the case of rational, trigonometric, and elliptic spin chains,
we propose an explicit ansatz for the analytic structure of Q-functions of the
extended Q-system. We conjecture that the extended Q-system constrained in such
a way is always in bijection with the Bethe algebra of commuting transfer
matrices of these models and moreover can be used to show that the Bethe
algebra has a simple joint spectrum.

generated by hybrid dynamics of unitaries and measurements, we study the long
time behavior of such systems. We demonstrate that even in the ""mixed"" phase, a
maximally mixed initial density matrix is purified on a time scale equal to the
Hilbert space dimension (i.e., exponential in system size), albeit with noisy
dynamics at intermediate times which we connect to Dyson Brownian motion. In
contrast, we show that free fermion systems -- i.e., ones where the unitaries
are generated by quadratic Hamiltonians and the measurements are of fermion
bilinears -- purify in a time quadratic in the system size. In particular, a
volume law phase for the entanglement entropy cannot be sustained in a free
fermion system.

of many binary stars. Recently, a WD merger product, IRAS 00500+6713, was
identified. IRAS 00500+6713 consists of a central star embedded in a circular
nebula. The analysis of the optical spectrum of the central star revealed that
it is hot, hydrogen and helium free, and drives an extremely fast wind with a
record breaking speed. The nebula is visible in infrared and in the [O III]
line images. No nebula spectroscopy was obtained prior to our observations.
Here we report the first deep X-ray imaging spectroscopic observations of IRAS
00500+6713. Both the central star and the nebula are detected in X-rays,
heralding the WD merger products as a new distinct type of strong X-ray
sources. Low-resolution X-ray spectra reveal large neon, magnesium, silicon,
and sulfur enrichment of the central star and the nebula. We conclude that IRAS
00500+6713 resulted from a merger of an ONe and a CO WD, which supports earlier
suggestion for a super-Chandrasekhar mass of this object. X-ray analysis
indicates that the merger was associated with an episode of carbon burning and
possibly accompanied by a SN Iax. In X-rays, we observe the point source
associated with the merger product while the surrounding diffuse nebula is a
supernova remnant. IRAS 00500+6713 will likely terminate its evolution with
another peculiar Type I supernova, where the final core collapse to a neutron
star might be induced by electron captures.

regions known as protoclusters. The large gas reservoirs and high rate of
galaxy interaction in protoclusters are expected to trigger star-formation
activity and luminous SMBH accretion in the host galaxies. We investigated the
AGN content of a gas-rich and starbursting protocluster at $z=4$, known as the
Distant Red Core (DRC). We observed with Chandra (139 ks) the 13 identified
members of the structure, and searched for luminous and possibly obscured AGN
among them. We also tested whether a hidden AGN can power the $Ly\alpha$ blob
(LAB) detected with VLT/MUSE in the DRC. We detected obscured X-ray emission
from the two most gas-rich members of the DRC, named DRC-1 and DRC-2. Both of
them are resolved into multiple interacting clumps in high-resolution ALMA and
HST observations. In particular, DRC-2 is found to host a luminous
($L_{2-10\,\mathrm{keV}}\approx3\times10^{45}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$)
Compton-thick ($N_H\gtrsim10^{24}\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$) QSO, comparable to the
most luminous QSOs known at all cosmic times. The AGN fraction among DRC
members is consistent with results found for lower redshift protoclusters.
However, X-ray stacking analysis reveals that SMBH accretion is likely also
taking place in other DRC galaxies that are not detected individually by
Chandra. Our results point toward the presence of a strong link between large
gas reservoirs, galaxy interactions, and luminous and obscured nuclear activity
in protocluster members. The powerful and obscured QSO detected in DRC-2 is
likely powering the nearby LAB detected with VLT/MUSE, possibly through
photoionization; however, we propose that the diffuse $Ly\alpha$ emission may
be due to gas shocked by a massive outflow launched by DRC-2 over a $\approx10$
kpc scale.

gives rise to macroscopically degenerate ground states thanks to a completely
flat lowest single-magnon band. The corresponding excitations can be localized
on loops in real space and have been coined ""localized magnons"". Thus, the
description of the many-body ground states amounts to characterizing the
allowed classical loop configurations and eliminating the quantum mechanical
linear relations between them. Here, we investigate this loop-gas description
on finite kagome lattices with open boundary conditions and compare the results
with exact diagonalization for the spin-1/2 XY model on the same lattice. We
find that the loop gas provides an exact account of the degenerate ground-state
manifold while a hard-hexagon description misses contributions from nested loop
configurations. The densest packing of the loops corresponds to a magnon
crystal that according to the zero-temperature magnetization curve is a stable
ground state of the spin-1/2 XY model in a window of magnetic fields of about
4% of the saturation field just below this saturation field. We also present
numerical results for the specific heat obtained by the related methods of
thermal pure quantum (TPQ) states and the finite-temperature Lanczos method
(FTLM). For a field in the stability range of the magnon crystal, one finds a
low-temperature maximum of the specific heat that corresponds to a
finite-temperature phase transition into the magnon crystal at low
temperatures.

absorption spectra from these observations. Firstly, the data have been
wavelength calibrated using LFC and ThAr methods. The LFC wavelength
calibration residuals are six times smaller than when using the standard ThAr
calibration. We give a direct comparison between $\alpha$ measurements made
using the two methods. Secondly, spectral modelling was performed using
Artificial Intelligence (fully automated, all human bias eliminated), including
a temperature parameter for each absorption component. Thirdly, in contrast to
previous work, additional model parameters were assigned to measure $\alpha$
for each individual absorption component. The increase in statistical
uncertainty from the larger number of model parameters is small and the method
allows a substantial advantage; outliers that would otherwise contribute a
significant systematic, possibly corrupting the entire measurement, are
identified and removed, permitting a more robust overall result. The $z_{abs} =
1.15$ absorption system along the HE0515$-$4414 sightline yields 40 new
$\alpha$ measurements. We constrain spatial fluctuations in $\alpha$ to be
$\Delta\alpha/\alpha \leq 9 \times 10^{-5}$ on scales $\approx 20\;{\rm

induce an exotic axionic insulating phase in which the sliding mode (phason) of
the CDW acts as a dynamical axion field, giving rise to a large positive
magneto-conductance [Wang et al., Phys. Rev. B 87, 161107(R) (2013); Roy et
al., Phys. Rev. B 92, 125141 (2015); J. Gooth et al., Nature 575, 315 (2019)].
In this work, we predict that dynamical strain can induce a bulk orbital
magnetization in time-reversal- (TR-) invariant WSMs that are gapped by a CDW.
We term this effect the ""dynamical piezomagnetic effect"" (DPME). Unlike in [J.
Gooth et al., Nature 575, 315 (2019)], the DPME introduced in this work occurs
in a bulk-constant (i.e., static and spatially homogeneous in the bulk) CDW,
and does not rely on fluctuations, such as a phason. By studying the low-energy
effective theory and a minimal tight-binding (TB) model, we find that the DPME
originates from an effective valley axion field that couples the
electromagnetic gauge field with a strain-induced pseudo-gauge field. In
particular, whereas the piezoelectric effects studied in previous works are
characterized by 2D Berry curvature, the DPME represents the first example of a
fundamentally 3D strain effect originating from the Chern-Simons 3-form. We
further find that the DPME has a discontinuous change at a critical value of
the phase of the CDW order parameter. We demonstrate that, when there is a jump
in the DPME, the surface of the system undergoes a topological quantum phase

modes and to quasiresonance. Next, we examine the three physical polarizations
of the Proca field and their relation to the electromagnetic field modes in the
massless limit. Exploiting a separation of variables, we obtain a five-term
recurrence relation from an appropriate ansatz for the radial function.
Gaussian elimination and the modified Lentz algorithm are applied, and the
quasinormal frequencies are computed from the roots of a continued fraction. We
validate our method by calculating quasibound state frequencies, which are

are derived through direct expansion of the MST solutions within the RWZ
formalism for first-order black hole perturbation theory (BHPT). By utilizing
factorization and a few computational simplifications, we are able to compute
the fluxes to 19PN, with each PN term calculated as a power series in (Darwin)
eccentricity to $e^{10}$. This compares favorably with the numeric fitting
approach used in previous work. We also compute PN terms to $e^{20}$ through
10PN. Then, we analyze the convergence properties of the composite energy flux
expansion by checking against numeric data for several orbits, both for the
full flux and also for the individual 220 mode, with various resummation
schemes tried for each. The match between the high-order series and numerical
calculations is generally strong, maintaining relative error better than
$10^{-5}$ except when $p$ (the semi-latus rectum) is small and $e$ is large.
However, the full-flux expansion demonstrates superior fidelity (particularly
at high $e$), as it is able to incorporate additional information from PN
theory. For the orbit $(p=10, e=1/2)$, the full flux achieves a best error near
$10^{-5}$, while the 220 mode exhibits error worse than $1\%$. Finally, we
describe a procedure for transforming these expansions to the harmonic gauge of
PN theory by analyzing Schwarzschild geodesic motion in harmonic coordinates.
This will facilitate future comparisons between BHPT and PN theory.

days, polarization arises from the forward shock emission which depends on the
post-shock magnetic field. The latter can originate both from compression of
existing fields, here the ISM magnetic field, and from shock generated
instabilities. For short GRBs, previous modelling of the polarization arising
from the forward shock considered a random field fully or partially confined to
the shock plane. However, the ISM magnetic field likely consists of both random
and ordered components. Here we study the impact of a more realistic magnetic
field having both ordered and random components. We present our semi-analytical
model and compute polarization curves arising for different magnetic field
configurations. We find that the presence of an ordered component, even
significantly weaker than the random one, has distinct signatures that could be
detectable. In the presence of an ordered component not in the observer plane,
we show that: i) for an observer inside the jet, the polarization angle
$\theta_p$ either remains constant during all the afterglow phase or exhibits
variations smaller than the 90\textdegree swing expected from a random
component solely, ii) for an observer outside the jet, the polarization angle
evolves from $\theta_p^{\max}$, before the jet break to its opposite after the
jet break. We also find that the upper limit polarization for GRB170817
requires a random field not fully confined to the shock plane and is compatible
with an ordered component as large as half the random one.

of its kind model to implement the idea of leptogenesis from three body decay

diagrams using resummed propagators along with DM. The standard model is
extended by three heavy singlet fermions, one scalar singlet and one scalar
doublet with appropriate discrete charges. Two of these singlet fermions not
only play non-trivial roles in generating light neutrino mass at radiative
level in scotogenic fashion, but also act as mediators in three body decay of
the third singlet fermion leading to desired CP asymmetry through interference
of such diagrams. With just one additional field compared to the minimal
scotogenic model, we show that successful leptogenesis can occur at a scale as
low as approximately 1 TeV which is much lower than the leptogenesis scale
found for minimal scotogenic model. Also, the realisation of this three body
decay leptogenesis naturally leads to a two component scalar singlet-doublet
dark matter scenario offering a rich phenomenology. Apart from having
interesting interplay of different couplings involved in processes related to
both leptogenesis and dark matter, the model can also be tested at different
experiments due to the existence of its particle spectrum at TeV scale.

constructed (tool construction), from available objects. In this paper, we
introduce a novel Tool Macgyvering framework that combines tool substitution
and construction using arbitration that decides between the two options to
output a final macgyvering solution. Our tool construction approach reasons
about the shape, material, and different ways of attaching objects to construct
a desired tool. We further develop value functions that enable the robot to
effectively arbitrate between substitution and construction. Our results show
that our tool construction approach is able to successfully construct working
tools with an accuracy of 96.67%, and our arbitration strategy successfully
chooses between substitution and construction with an accuracy of 83.33%.

played several key roles over the last decade: it aided the identification of
multiple images in this cluster and the study of MACS1149-JD1 at redshift
$z\simeq9$, it was used to estimate the properties of the first multiply imaged
supernova, Refsdal, in its discovery paper, and of the first caustic crossing
event by a cluster, Lensed Star 1. Supernova Refsdal supplied an invaluable
opportunity to conduct a blind test of the ability of common lens-modeling
techniques to accurately describe the properties of SN Refsdal's images and
predict the reappearance of one of its counter images that was due about a year
post-discovery of the original Einstein cross. Thanks to this practice, in
which our submitted model yielded some outlying results, we located a numerical
artifact in the time delay (TD) calculation part of the code, which was now
fixed. This artifact did not influence the reproduction of multiple images
(i.e., the deflection fields -- which are those constrained directly from the
observations) or the derived mass model, and so it remained unnoticed prior to
supernova Refsdal, emphasizing the importance of blind tests in astronomy. Here
we update our model and present revised LTM measurements for Refsdal. These are
important not only for completing the LTM view of the Refsdal event, but also
because they affect the range of values predicted from different lens-modeling
techniques and thus the range of systematic uncertainties for the TD
calculation and the resulting Hubble constant.

strong-lensing model for this cluster, described in a companion paper, and is
generated using the same pipeline but with a different parametrization.
Together these two models probe different possible solutions in a relatively
self-consistent manner and can be used to examine systematic uncertainties and
relevant differences between the two parameterizations. We obtain reasonably
similar (agreeing to within $\simeq1-3\sigma$, in most cases) time delays and
magnification ratios, with respect to S1, from the two different methods,
although the LTM predictions seem to be systematically shorter/smaller for some
of the images. Most notably, the time delay [and 95\% CI] between the Einstein
cross (in particular, image S1), and SX, the image that appeared about a year
after the original discovery of the cross, differs substantially between the
parametric method (326 [300 -- 359] days) and the LTM method (224 [198 -- 306]
days), which seems to underestimates the true reappearance time. The cause for
this systematic difference is unclear at present. We speculate on its possible
origin and note that a refined measurement of SN Refsdal's properties should
help to more strongly discriminate between the two solutions, and thus between
the two descriptions for the intrinsic shape of the underlying matter
distribution. We also discuss the implications of our results for the Hubble
constant.

great potential to increase the efficiency and reproducibility of computing
more complete tumor measurements and imaging biomarkers, comparing to (often

the large-scale clinical oncology patient studies that utilize medical imaging.
Deep learning approaches have shown robust segmentation performances for
certain types of tumors, e.g., brain tumors in MRI imaging, when a training
dataset with plenty of pixel-level fully-annotated tumor images is available.
However, more than often, we are facing the challenge that only (very) limited
annotations are feasible to acquire, especially for hard tumors. Pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) segmentation is one of the most challenging tumor
segmentation tasks, yet critically important for clinical needs. Previous work
on PDAC segmentation is limited to the moderate amounts of annotated patient
images (n<300) from venous or venous+arterial phase CT scans. Based on a new
self-learning framework, we propose to train the PDAC segmentation model using
a much larger quantity of patients (n~=1,000), with a mix of annotated and
un-annotated venous or multi-phase CT images. Pseudo annotations are generated
by combining two teacher models with different PDAC segmentation specialties on
unannotated images, and can be further refined by a teaching assistant model
that identifies associated vessels around the pancreas. A student model is
trained on both manual and pseudo annotated multi-phase images. Experiment
results show that our proposed method provides an absolute improvement of 6.3%
Dice score over the strong baseline of nnUNet trained on annotated images,
achieving the performance (Dice = 0.71) similar to the inter-observer

specification of the coefficients for each case, which can be functions of

data-driven modeling approach. When the data available is directly on the PDF,
then there exist methods for inverse problems that can be employed to infer the
coefficients and thus determine the FP equation and subsequently obtain its
solution. Herein, we address a more realistic scenario, where only sparse data
are given on the particles' positions at a few time instants, which are not
sufficient to accurately construct directly the PDF even at those times from
existing methods, e.g., kernel estimation algorithms. To this end, we develop a
general framework based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) that
introduces a new loss function using the Kullback-Leibler divergence to connect
the stochastic samples with the FP equation, to simultaneously learn the
equation and infer the multi-dimensional PDF at all times. In particular, we
consider two types of inverse problems, type I where the FP equation is known
but the initial PDF is unknown, and type II in which, in addition to unknown
initial PDF, the drift and diffusion terms are also unknown. In both cases, we
investigate problems with either Brownian or Levy noise or a combination of
both. We demonstrate the new PINN framework in detail in the one-dimensional
case (1D) but we also provide results for up to 5D demonstrating that we can
infer both the FP equation and} dynamics simultaneously at all times with high
accuracy using only very few discrete observations of the particles.

and social networks, which persists even under the influence of strong noise.
Previous research on oscillators subject to common noise has shown that noise
can actually facilitate synchronization, as correlations in the dynamics can be
inherited from the noise itself. However, in many spatially distributed
networks, such as the mammalian circadian system, the noise that different
oscillators experience can be effectively uncorrelated. Here, we show that
uncorrelated noise can in fact enhance synchronization when the oscillators are
coupled. Strikingly, our analysis also shows that uncorrelated noise can be
more effective than common noise in enhancing synchronization. We first
establish these results theoretically for phase and phase-amplitude oscillators
subject to either or both additive and multiplicative noise. We then confirm
the predictions through experiments on coupled electrochemical oscillators. Our
findings suggest that uncorrelated noise can promote rather than inhibit
coherence in natural systems and that the same effect can be harnessed in
engineered systems.

one-class support vector machines (OCSVM). Designed to detect sources deviating

create a model for the expected data based on WISE objects with spectroscopic
identifications in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Subsequently, it marked
as anomalous those sources whose WISE photometry was shown to be inconsistent

spectroscopy follow-up observations of a subset of 36 bright ($g_{AB}$<19.5)
objects marked as 'anomalous' by the OCSVM code to verify its performance.
Among the observed objects, we identified three main types of sources: i) low

including three Wolf-Rayet galaxies; ii) broad-line quasi-stellar objects
(QSOs) (33%) including low-ionisation broad absorption line (LoBAL) quasars and
a rare QSO with strong and narrow ultraviolet iron emission; iii) Galactic
objects in dusty phases of their evolution (3%). The nature of four of these

modulator, the corrugated feedhorns array, and the lower temperature stages; a
4He evaporator cooling at ~1K the interferometer beam combiner; a 3He
evaporator cooling at ~0.3K the focal-plane detector arrays. The cryogenic
system has been tested and validated for more than 6 months of continuous
operation. The detector arrays have reached a stable operating temperature of
0.33K, while the polarization modulator has been operated from a ~10K base

hyperbolic nature of viscoelastic constitutive equations. Despite their
superior accuracy and efficiency, pseudo-spectral methods require the
introduction of artificial diffusion (AD) for numerical stability in hyperbolic
problems, which alters the physical nature of the system. This study presents a
hybrid numerical procedure that integrates an upwind total variation
diminishing (TVD) finite-difference scheme, which is known for its stability in
hyperbolic problems, for the polymer stress convection term into an overall
pseudo-spectral numerical framework. Numerically stable solutions are obtained
for Weissenberg number well beyond O(100) without the need for either global or
local AD. Side-by-side comparison with an existing pseudo-spectral code reveals
the impact of AD, which is shown to differ drastically between flow regimes.
Elastoinertial turbulence (EIT) becomes unphysically suppressed when AD, at any
level necessary for stabilizing the pseudo-spectral method, is used. This is
attributed to the importance of sharp stress shocks in its self-sustaining
cycles. Nevertheless , in regimes dominated by the classical inertial mechanism
for turbulence generation, there is still an acceptable range of AD that can be
safely used to predict the statistics, dynamics, and structures of drag-reduced
turbulence. Detailed numerical resolution analysis of the new hybrid method,
especially for capturing the EIT states, is also presented.

interstellar medium and hosts a central dust lane with emission lines. These
dust lanes are frequent in elliptical galaxies, but the case of NGC 3311 might
be particularly interesting for problems of dust lifetime and the role of cool
gas in the central parts. We aim to use archival HST images and MUSE data to
investigate the central dust structure of NGC 3311. We used the tool PyParadise
to model the stellar population and extract the emission lines. The HST/ACS
colour map reveals the known dust structures, but also blue spots, which are
places of strong line emission. A dusty 'mini-jet' emanates from the centre.
The distribution of the emission line gas matches the dust silhouette almost
exactly. Close to the brightest Halpha emission, the ratio [NII]/Halpha
resembles that of HII-regions; in the outer parts, [NII] gets stronger and is
similar to LINER-like spectra. The gas kinematics is consistent with that of a
rotating disc. The Doppler shifts of the strongest line emissions, which
indicate the areas of highest star formation activity, smoothly fit into the
disc symmetry. The metallicity is supersolar. The presence of neutral gas is
indicated by the fit residuals of the stellar NaI D absorption line, which we
interpret as interstellar absorption. We estimate the mass of the neutral gas
to be of the order of the X-ray mass. The dynamical mass infers a stellar
population of intermediate age, whose globular clusters have already been
identified. Our findings can be harmonised in a scenario in which the star
formation is triggered by the accretion of cold gas onto a pre-existing
gas/dust disc or ring. Newly produced dust then contributes to the longevity of
the dust.

localized by disordered small variations in the substrate potential provided by

expected to coat the pore walls smoothing out the substrate potential, and
superfluidity is observed in the central region. Building on earlier quantum
Monte Carlo results, we propose a scenario for this crossover using a shell
model of coupled Luttinger liquids. We find that a small radius pore will
always localize the helium atoms, but above a critical radius, a single 1D
channel flows through the pore and can be described by Luttinger liquid theory.

of modern large angular scale cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments
around the world. A big effort is undergoing with the deployment of many
ground-based, balloon-borne and satellite experiments using different methods
to separate this faint polarized component from the incoming radiation. One of
the largely used technique is the Stokes Polarimetry that uses a rotating
half-wave plate (HWP) and a linear polarizer to separate and modulate the
polarization components with low residual cross-polarization. This paper
describes the QUBIC Stokes Polarimeter highlighting its design features and its
performances. A common systematic with these devices is the generation of large
spurious signals synchronous with the rotation and proportional to the
emissivity of the optical elements. A key feature of the QUBIC Stokes
Polarimeter is to operate at cryogenic temperature in order to minimize this
unwanted component. Moving efficiently this large optical element at low
temperature constitutes a big engineering challenge in order to reduce friction
power dissipation. Big attention has been given during the designing phase to
minimize the differential thermal contractions between parts. The rotation is
driven by a stepper motor placed outside the cryostat to avoid thermal load
dissipation at cryogenic temperature. The tests and the results presented in
this work show that the QUBIC polarimeter can easily achieve a precision below
0.1{\deg} in positioning simply using the stepper motor precision and the
optical absolute encoder. The rotation induces only few mK of extra power load
on the second cryogenic stage (~ 8 K).

indicate the presence of a much stronger $\approx$2 kG axisymmetric dipolar
field, which contributes no circular polarization signal due to the equator-on

mass proxies at all scales are necessary in order to fully utilize clusters as
cosmological probes. At the cores of strong lensing clusters, the Einstein
radius can be turned into a mass estimate. This efficient method has been
routinely used in literature, in lieu of detailed mass models; however, its
scatter, assumed to be $\sim30\%$, has not yet been quantified. Here, we assess
this method by testing it against ray-traced images of cluster-scale halos from
the Outer Rim N-body cosmological simulation. We measure a scatter of $13.9\%$
and a positive bias of $8.8\%$ in $M(<\theta_E)$, with no systematic
correlation with total cluster mass, concentration, or lens or source
redshifts. We find that increased deviation from spherical symmetry increases
the scatter; conversely, where the lens produces arcs that cover a large
fraction of its Einstein circle, both the scatter and the bias decrease. While
spectroscopic redshifts of the lensed sources are critical for accurate
magnifications and time delays, we show that for the purpose of estimating the
total enclosed mass, the scatter introduced by source redshift uncertainty is
negligible compared to other sources of error. Finally, we derive and apply an
empirical correction that eliminates the bias, and reduces the scatter to
$10.1\%$ without introducing new correlations with mass, redshifts, or
concentration. Our analysis provides the first quantitative assessment of the
uncertainties in $M(<\theta_E)$, and enables its effective use as a core mass
estimator of strong lensing galaxy clusters.

forecast models is a relatively new endeavour there is a rich history of
climate model emulation. This is primarily because while weather modelling is

steady-state climate response has been possible for many years and provides
significant speed increases that allow solving inverse problems for e.g.

secure than traditional patterns based on standard guessability metrics, more
similar to that of 4-/6-digit PINs, and even more difficult to guess for a
simulated attacker. Users express positive sentiments in qualitative feedback,
particularly those who currently (or previously) used Android unlock patterns,

certain class of Scalar Tensor Theories of gravity (STT's) where a new order
parameter, the {\it scalar charge}, appears within the star. This is the well
known phenomenon of spontaneous scalarization (SC) discovered by Damour and
Esposito-Far\`ese in 1993. Under such mechanism neutron stars can afford in
principle a maximum mass larger than in general relativity (GR) for a given
equation of state without taking into account additional observational
constraints (e.g. binary systems). This opens the possibility that neutron
stars might be formed with masses as large as $\sim 2 M_\odot$ without the need
of stiff, or more exotic, equations of state for the nuclear matter. Thus,
STT's through SC may account for compact objects with large masses observed
recently in the sky in the form of pulsars (PSR J0348+0432 with $M= 2.01 M_\pm
0.04\odot$ observed in 2013, PSR J1614-2230 with $M= 1.97\pm 0.04 M_\odot$
observed in 2010 or J0740+6620 $M= 2.14^{+0.10}_{-0.09} M_\odot$ observed in
2019). However, we argue that even if that was possible such maximum mass
models within STT cannot be formed solely from the dynamic transition of an
initial ""isolated"" unscalarized neutron star whose mass cannot exceed the
maximum mass in GR. This is because SC, being an energetic-preferred
configuration, produces a final static star with a mass lower that the initial
one with a fixed baryon mass. The mass difference between the initial and final
configurations is radiated away in the form of a scalar-field. Thus, maximum
mass models of scalarized neutron stars, if present in nature, must have formed
by a different process, perhaps of cosmological origin or by the subsequent
accretion of additional scalar charge and mass.

to start with a nonmagnetic Dirac semimetal and break time-reversal symmetry
via magnetic doping or magnetic proximity. Here we explore this scenario in the
case of the Dirac semimetal Cd$_{3}$As$_{2}$, based on first-principles
density-functional calculations and subsequent low-energy modeling of
Cd$_{3}$As$_{2}$ in the presence of a Zeeman field applied along the symmetry
axis. We clarify how each four$-$fold degenerate Dirac node splits into four
Weyl nodes, two with chirality $\pm 1$ and two higher-order nodes with
chirality $\pm 2$. Using a minimal \kdotp model Hamiltonian whose parameters
are fit to the first-principles calculations, we detail the evolution of the
Fermi surfaces and their Chern numbers as the Fermi energy is scanned across
the region of the Weyl nodes at fixed Zeeman field. We also compute the
intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity as a function of Fermi-level position,
finding a characteristic inverted-dome structure. Cd$_{3}$As$_{2}$ is
especially well suited to such a study because of its high mobility, but the
qualitative behavior revealed here should be applicable to other Dirac

have been transplanted to Software Engineering tasks, often quite successfully.
Yet a transplanted model's initial success at a given task does not necessarily
mean it is well-suited for the task. In this work, we examine a common example
of this phenomenon: the conceit that ""software patching is like language
translation"". We demonstrate empirically that there are subtle, but critical
distinctions between sequence-to-sequence models and translation model: while
program repair benefits greatly from the former, general modeling architecture,
it actually suffers from design decisions built into the latter, both in terms
of translation accuracy and diversity. Given these findings, we demonstrate how
a more principled approach to model design, based on our empirical findings and
general knowledge of software development, can lead to better solutions. Our
findings also lend strong support to the recent trend towards synthesizing
edits of code conditional on the buggy context, to repair bugs. We implement
such models ourselves as ""proof-of-concept"" tools and empirically confirm that
they behave in a fundamentally different, more effective way than the studied
translation-based architectures. Overall, our results demonstrate the merit of
studying the intricacies of machine learned models in software engineering: not

Subsequently, the sub-optimal control problem is formulated and solved to

is addressed for ease-of-implementability on low-cost controller boards.
Finally controller hardware-in-the-loop simulations on OPAL-RT are performed in

\subseteq[t]$ of $|T|=w$ tasks, a memoryless worker-task assignment function is
any function $\phi$ that assigns the workers $[w]$ to the tasks $T$ based only
on the current value of $T$. The assignment function $\phi$ is said to have
switching cost at most $k$ if, for every task multiset $T$, changing the
contents of $T$ by one task changes $\phi(T)$ by at most $k$ worker
assignments. The goal of memoryless worker task assignment is to construct an
assignment function with the smallest possible switching cost.
  In past work, the problem of determining the optimal switching cost has been
posed as an open question. There are no known sub-linear upper bounds, and
after considerable effort, the best known lower bound remains 4 (ICALP 2020).
  We show that it is possible to achieve polylogarithmic switching cost. We
give a construction via the probabilistic method that achieves switching cost
$O(\log w \log (wt))$ and an explicit construction that achieves switching cost
$\operatorname{polylog} (wt)$. We also prove a super-constant lower bound on
switching cost: we show that for any value of $w$, there exists a value of $t$
for which the optimal switching cost is $w$. Thus it is not possible to achieve
a switching cost that is sublinear strictly as a function of $w$.
  Finally, we present an application of the worker-task assignment problem to a
metric embeddings problem. In particular, we use our results to give the first
low-distortion embedding from sparse binary vectors into low-dimensional

1) inherently suboptimal due to information loss incurred by non-invertible
operations in ISP, and 2) inconsistent with the real imaging pipeline where VSR
in fact serves as a pre-processing unit of ISP. To address this issue, we
propose a new VSR method that can directly exploit camera sensor data,
accompanied by a carefully built Raw Video Dataset (RawVD) for training,
validation, and testing. This method consists of a Successive Deep Inference
(SDI) module and a reconstruction module, among others. The SDI module is
designed according to the architectural principle suggested by a canonical
decomposition result for Hidden Markov Model (HMM) inference; it estimates the
target high-resolution frame by repeatedly performing pairwise feature fusion
using deformable convolutions. The reconstruction module, built with
elaborately designed Attention-based Residual Dense Blocks (ARDBs), serves the
purpose of 1) refining the fused feature and 2) learning the color information
needed to generate a spatial-specific transformation for accurate color
correction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that owing to the informativeness
of the camera raw data, the effectiveness of the network architecture, and the
separation of super-resolution and color correction processes, the proposed
method achieves superior VSR results compared to the state-of-the-art and can
be adapted to any specific camera-ISP. Code and dataset are available at

evaluate whether this claim is supported by physics graduate school admissions
decisions. We used admissions data from five PhD-granting physics departments
over a 2-year period (N=2537) to see how the fraction of applicants admitted
varied based on their physics GRE scores. We compared applicants with low GPAs
to applicants with higher GPAs, applicants from large undergraduate
universities to applicants from smaller undergraduate universities, and
applicants from selective undergraduate institutions to applicants from less
selective undergraduate institutions. We also performed a mediation and
moderation analysis to provide statistical rigor and to better understand the
previous relationships. We find that for applicants who might otherwise have
been missed (e.g. have a low GPA or attended a small or less selective school)
having a high physics GRE score did not seem to increase the applicant's
chances of being admitted to the schools. However, having a low physics GRE
score seemed to penalize otherwise competitive applicants. Thus, our work
suggests that the physics GRE does not, in fact, help applicants who might

  Deep Reinforcement Learning",,,,,"cs.LG cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Dynamic dispatching is one of the core problems for operation optimization in
traditional industries such as mining, as it is about how to smartly allocate
the right resources to the right place at the right time. Conventionally, the
industry relies on heuristics or even human intuitions which are often
short-sighted and sub-optimal solutions. Leveraging the power of AI and
Internet of Things (IoT), data-driven automation is reshaping this area.
However, facing its own challenges such as large-scale and heterogenous trucks
running in a highly dynamic environment, it can barely adopt methods developed
in other domains (e.g., ride-sharing). In this paper, we propose a novel Deep
Reinforcement Learning approach to solve the dynamic dispatching problem in
mining. We first develop an event-based mining simulator with parameters
calibrated in real mines. Then we propose an experience-sharing Deep Q Network
with a novel abstract state/action representation to learn memories from
heterogeneous agents altogether and realizes learning in a centralized way. We
demonstrate that the proposed methods significantly outperform the most widely
adopted approaches in the industry by $5.56\%$ in terms of productivity. The
proposed approach has great potential in a broader range of industries (e.g.,
manufacturing, logistics) which have a large-scale of heterogenous equipment
working in a highly dynamic environment, as a general framework for dynamic
resource allocation.

~1 micrometer per orbit (Cheng et al., 2017; Grundy et al., 2018). While there
could be spatial variation in the deposition rate, this has not yet been
rigorously quantified, and naively the haze should coat the surface more
uniformly than was observed. One way (among many) to explain this contradiction
is for atmospheric pressure at the surface to drop low enough to interrupt haze
production and stop the deposition of particles onto part of the surface,
driving heterogeneity. If the surface pressure drops to less than 10^-3 - 10^-4
microbar and the CH4 mixing ratio remains nearly constant at the observed 2015
value, the atmosphere becomes transparent to ultraviolet radiation (Young et
al., 2018), which would shut off haze production at its source. If the surface
pressure falls below 0.06 microbar, the atmosphere ceases to be global, and
instead is localized over only the warmest part of the surface, restricting the
location of deposition (Spencer et al., 1997). In Pluto's current atmosphere,
haze monomers collect together into aggregate particles at beginning at 0.5
microbar; if the surface pressure falls below this limit, the appearance of
particles deposited at different times of year and in different locations could
be different. We use VT3D, an energy balance model (Young, 2017), to model the

induced by a periodically oscillating wall in a Newtonian fluid between two
infinite parallel plates as well as flow in an infinitely long duct. We first
derived the formula of the flow produced by the wall motions. Second, we
calculate the second Aris moment for all time and its long-time limiting
effective diffusivity as a function of the geometrical parameters, frequency,
viscosity, and diffusivity. Using a new formalism based upon the Helmholtz
operator we establish a new single series formula for the variance. We show
that the viscous-dominated limit results in a linear shear layer for which the
effective diffusivity is bounded. For finite viscosities, the enhanced
diffusion diverges in the high-frequency limit. We present a study of the
effective diffusivity surface as a function of the non-dimensional parameters

experiments are performed in water using particle tracking velocimetry to
quantitatively measure the fluid flow. Using fluorescein dye as the passive

image analysis suggests that the distribution variance be measured using the
full width at half maximum is robust to noise. Further, we show that the scalar
skewness is zero for linear shear flows at all times, whereas for the nonlinear
Stokes layer, the skewness sign can be controlled through the oscillating
phase. Last, for single-frequency wall motion, the long-time skewness decays at
the faster rate as compared with the case with steady flow.

allow the user to provide feedback about large errors by drawing scribbles in
desired 2D views. Next, we aim to correct minor errors, in which users drag and
drop mesh vertices, assisted by a neural interactive module implemented as a
Graph Convolutional Network. Experimentally, we show that only a few user
interactions are needed to produce good quality 3D shapes on popular benchmarks

scattered by ambient phonons. Large-polaron mobilities, e.g. 1 cm2/V-sec at 300
K, are much smaller than the minimum possible for conventional electronic
charge carriers. The minimum mobility for an itinerant charge carrier of
effective mass m, eh/mkT, occurs when its mean-free-path falls to its de
Broglie wavelength, e.g. 300 cm2/V-sec at room temperature for m equaling the
free-electron mass. Distinctively, large-polarons frequency-dependent
conductivities consist of two contributions that separate as the temperature is
reduced. Large polarons Drude-like contributions are relegated to frequencies
below those of characteristic phonons. Contributions from excitations of large
polarons self-trapped electronic carriers occur above those of characteristic
phonons. Oppositely charged large polarons repel one another at short range.
The resulting suppressed recombination facilitates exceptionally efficient
solar cells. Large polarons of the same charge attract one another at short

a (quasi-) thermal spectral component in addition to the Band function. In
photospheric emission models, a prominent thermal component broadened by
sub-photospheric dissipation is expected to be released at the photospheric
radius, $r_{\rm ph}\sim10^{12}\,$cm. We consider an ultra-relativistic strongly
magnetized outflow with a striped-wind magnetic-field structure undergoing
gradual and continuous magnetic energy dissipation at $r<r_s$ that heats and
accelerates the flow, leading to a bulk Lorentz factor
$\Gamma(r)=\Gamma_\infty\min[1,(r/r_s)^{1/3}]$, where typically $r_{\rm
ph}<r_s$. Similar dynamics and energy dissipation rates are also expected in
highly-variable magnetized outflows without stripes/field-reversals. Two modes
of particle energy injection are considered: (a) power-law electrons, e.g.
accelerated by magnetic reconnection, and (b) continuous distributed heating of
all electrons (and $e^\pm$-pairs), e.g. due to MHD instabilities. Time-resolved
energy spectra are obtained using a numerical code that evolves coupled kinetic
equations for a photon-electron-positron plasma. We find that (i) the thermal
component peaks at $(1+z)E_{\rm pk}\sim0.2-1\,$MeV, for a source at redshift
$z$, and becomes subdominant if the total injected energy density exceeds the
thermal one, (ii) power-law electrons cool mainly by synchrotron emission
whereas mildly relativistic and almost monoenergetic electrons in the
distributed heating scenario cool by Comptonization on thermal peak photons,
(iii) both scenarios can yield a low-energy break at $E_{\rm br}\approx E_{\rm
th}$, and (iv) the $0.5(1+z)^{-1}\,$keV X-ray emission is suppressed in the
power-law injection case, but it is expected for the distributed heating
scenario. Energy-dependent linear polarization can differentiate between the
two energy injection cases.

rare-event simulations involving the behavior of a diffusion process pertaining
to a chain of distributed systems with random perturbations. We also assume
that the distributed system formed by $n$-subsystems -- in which a small random
perturbation enters in the first subsystem and then subsequently transmitted to
the other subsystems -- satisfies an appropriate H\""{o}rmander condition. Here
we provide an efficient importance sampling estimator, with an exponential
variance decay rate, for the asymptotics of the probabilities of the rare
events involving such a diffusion process that also ensures a minimum relative
estimation error in the small noise limit. The framework for such an analysis
basically relies on the connection between the probability theory of large
deviations and the values functions for a family of stochastic control problems
associated with the underlying distributed system, where such a connection
provides a computational paradigm -- based on an exponentially-tilted biasing
distribution -- for constructing efficient importance sampling estimators for
the rare-event simulation. Moreover, as a by-product, the framework also allows
us to derive a family of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman for which we also provide a

measurements show a prominent variability in phase with the solar cycle, as
well as fluctuations on timescales shorter than a few days. However, the
measurements were done by multiple and usually relatively short-lived missions
making the possible long-term trend in the TSI highly uncertain. While the
variability in the UV irradiance is clearly in-phase with the solar cycle, the
phase of the variability in the visible range has been debated. In this paper,
we aim at getting an insight into the long-term trend of TSI since 1996 and the
phase of the solar irradiance variations in the visible part of the spectrum.
We use independent ground-based full-disc photometric observations in Ca~II~K
and continuum from the Rome and San Fernando observatories to compute the TSI
since 1996. We follow the empirical San Fernando approach based on the
photometric sum index. We find a weak declining trend in the TSI of
-7.8$^{+4.9}_{-0.8}\times10^{-3}$ Wm$^{-2}$y$^{-1}$ between the 1996 and 2008
activity minima, while between 2008 and 2019 the reconstructed TSI shows no
trend to a marginally decreasing (but statistically insignificant) trend of
-0.1$^{+0.25}_{-0.02}\times10^{-3}$ Wm$^{-2}$y$^{-1}$. The reference TSI series
used for the reconstruction does not significantly affect the determined trend.
The variation in the blue continuum (409.2 nm) is rather flat, while the
variation in the red continuum (607.1 nm) is marginally in anti-phase, although
this result is extremely sensitive to the accurate assessment of the quiet Sun
level in the images. These results provide further insights into the long-term
variation of the total solar irradiance. The amplitude of the variations in the
visible is below the uncertainties of the processing, which prevents an
assessment of the phase of the variations.

previous solutions required some restrictive assumptions on the IBV conditions,
e.g., zero initial velocity, smallness of boundary conditions. For arbitrary
non-breaking initial conditions in the physical space, we present an explicit
formula for equivalent IBV conditions in the hodograph plane, which can readily
be treated by conventional methods. Our procedure, which we call the method of
data projection, is based on the Taylor formula and allows us to reduce the
transformed IBV data given on curves in the hodograph plane to the equivalent
data on lines. Our method works equally well for any inclined bathymetry (not
only plane beaches) and, moreover, is fully analytical for U-shaped bays.
Numerical simulations show that our method is very robust and can be used to
give express forecasting of tsunami wave inundation in narrow bays and fjords

parameter space, making any two gapped phases adiabatically connected to each
other without closing the band gap. Using the Pfaffian approach based on the

jurisdictional governments -- such as cities, counties, states, and countries

quarantine policy's effectiveness depends upon whether (i) the network of

short delay in detection, and (iii) the government has control over and
knowledge of the necessary parts of the network (no leakage of behaviors). As
these conditions generally fail to be satisfied, especially when interactions
cross borders, we show that substantial improvements are possible if
governments are outward-looking and proactive: triggering quarantines in
reaction to neighbors' infection rates, in some cases even before infections
are detected internally. We also show that even a few lax governments -- those
that wait for nontrivial internal infection rates before quarantining -- impose
substantial costs on the whole system. Our results illustrate the importance of
understanding contagion across policy borders and offer a starting point in
designing proactive policies for decentralized jurisdictions.

(SO) magnetic field. We find that the polarization properties in a SM model are
very similar to these in a corresponding SO model (e.g., synchrotron emission
in a mixed magnetic field with an aligned ordered part (SMA) and synchrotron
emission with a purely ordered aligned magnetic field (SOA)), only with a lower
polarization degree (PD). We also discuss the statistical properties of the
models. We find PDs of the simulated bursts are concentrated around $25\%$ for
both SOA and synchrotron emission in a purely ordered toroidal magnetic field
(SOT), while they can range from $0\%$ to $25\%$ for SMA and synchrotron
emission in a mixed magnetic field with a toroidal ordered part (SMT),
depending on $\xi_B$ value, i.e., the ratio of magnetic reduction of the
ordered magnetic field over that of random magnetic field. From statistics, if
PDs of majority GRBs are non-zero, then it favours SO and SM models. Further,
if there are some bright GRBs with a prominently lower PDs than that of the
majority GRBs, it favours SOT (SMT) models; if all the bright GRBs have
comparable PDs with the majority ones, it favours SOA (SMA) models. Finally, we
apply our results to POLAR's data and find that $\sim10\%$ time-integrated PDs
of the observed bursts favor SMA and SMT models, and $\xi_B$ parameter of these
bursts is constrained to be around 1.135.

challenging data mining task in the field of knowledge discovery in databases

to introduce a preference relation into patterns and to discover the most
preferred patterns under the constraint of statistical significance, which has
never been considered in existing SSPM problems. We propose an iterative
multiple testing procedure that can alternately reject a hypothesis and safely
ignore the hypotheses that are less useful than the rejected hypothesis. One
advantage of filtering out patterns with low utility is that it avoids
consumption of the significance budget by rejection of useless (that is,
uninteresting) patterns. This allows the significance budget to be focused on
useful patterns, leading to more useful discoveries.
  We show that the proposed method can control the familywise error rate (FWER)
under certain assumptions, that can be satisfied by a realistic problem class
in SSPM.\@We also show that the proposed method always discovers a set of
patterns that is at least equally or more useful than those discovered using
the standard Tarone-Bonferroni method SSPM.\@Finally, we conducted several
experiments with both synthetic and real-world data to evaluate the performance

under consideration. Experimental results show that choosing an optimal number
of events for feature encoding is challenging, resulting in the need to
consider each event log individually when selecting an optimal value. Ensemble
schemes improve the performance of low performing classifiers in this task,
such as SVM, whereas high performing classifiers, such as tree-based

Therefore, encouraging conversations between different groups of users and

describe the connection between DD and global assortativity of the network from
both formal and conceptual perspective, and show that DD can reveal structural

Typically, edges with different DD play different structural roles and the DD
distribution is an important network signature. Notably, DD is the basic unit
of assortativity. We provide an explanation as to why DD can characterize
structural heterogeneity in mixing patterns unlike global assortativity and
local node assortativity. By analyzing synthetic and real networks, we show
that DD distribution can be used to distinguish between different types of
networks including those networks that cannot be easily distinguished using
degree sequence and global assortativity. Moreover, we show DD to be an
indicator for topological robustness of scale-free networks. Overall, DD is a
local measure that is simple to define, easy to evaluate, and that reveals
structural properties of networks not readily seen from other measures.

Increased integration densities, speed, and power of electronic and

higher thermal conductivity, improved reliability, and lower cost. Graphene has
emerged as a promising filler material that can meet the demands of future
high-speed and high-powered electronics. This review describes the use of
graphene as a filler in curing and non-curing polymer matrices. Special
attention is given to strategies for achieving the thermal percolation
threshold with its corresponding characteristic increase in the overall thermal
conductivity. Many applications require high thermal conductivity of the
composites while simultaneously preserving electrical insulation. A hybrid

technology for independent control of electrical and thermal conduction.
Reliability and lifespan performance of thermal interface materials is an

first steps when analysing multivariate data for which only the directions (and
not the magnitudes) are of interest. In this work, a projection-based
Cram\'er-von Mises test of uniformity on the hypersphere is introduced. This
test can be regarded as an extension of the well-known Watson test of circular
uniformity to the hypersphere. The null asymptotic distribution of the test
statistic is obtained and, via numerical experiments, shown to be tractable and
practical. A novel study on the uniformity of the distribution of craters on
Venus illustrates the usage of the test.

electroproduction process,1H(e,e'p)pi0, in the backward-angle regime (u-channel
process) above the resonance region. The produced pi0 is emitted 180 degrees
opposite to the virtual-photon momentum. This study also aims to apply the
well-known Rosenbluth separation technique that provides the model-independent
differential cross-sections at the never explored u-channel kinematics region.
Currently, the ""soft-hard transition"" in u-channel meson production remains an
interesting and unexplored subject. The available theoretical frameworks offer
competing interpretations for the observed backward-angle cross section peaks.
In a ""soft"" hadronic Regge exchange description, the backward meson production
comes from the interference between nucleon exchange and the meson produced via
re-scattering within the nucleon. Whereas in the ""hard"" GPD-like backward
collinear factorization regime, the scattering amplitude factorizes into a hard
subprocess amplitude and baryon to meson transition distribution amplitudes
(TDAs), otherwise known as super skewed parton distributions (SuperSPDs). Both
TDAs and SPDs are universal non-perturbative objects of nucleon structure
accessible only through backward-angle kinematics. The separated cross
sections:sigma_T,sigma_L and T/L ratio at Q2=2-6 GeV2, provide a direct test of
two predictions from the TDA model. The magnitude and u-dependence of the
separated cross sections also provide a direct connection to the re-scattering
Regge picture. The extracted interaction radius (from u-dependence) at
different Q2 can be used to study the soft-hard transition in the u-channel
kinematics. The acquisition of these data will be an important step forward in
validating the existence of a backward factorization scheme of the nucleon
structure function and establishing its applicable kinematic range.

Gaussian process (GP) regression. We consider a sparse projection of input
variables and a general stationary covariance model that depends on the
Euclidean distance between the projected features. The sparse projection matrix
is considered as an unknown parameter. We propose a forward stagewise approach
with embedded gradient descent steps to co-optimize the parameter with other
covariance parameters based on the maximization of a non-convex marginal
likelihood function with a concave sparsity penalty, and some convergence
properties of the algorithm are provided. The proposed model covers a broader
class of stationary covariance functions than the existing automatic relevance
determination approaches, and the solution approach is more computationally
feasible than the existing MCMC sampling procedures for the automatic relevance
parameter estimation with a sparsity prior. The approach is evaluated for a
large number of simulated scenarios. The choice of tuning parameters and the
accuracy of the parameter estimation are evaluated with the simulation study.
In the comparison to some chosen benchmark approaches, the proposed approach
has provided a better accuracy in the variable selection. It is applied to an
important problem of identifying environmental factors that affect an
atmospheric corrosion of metal alloys.

of microdata tables. Although existing approaches based on generalization can
provide enough protection for identities, anonymized tables always suffer from
various attribute disclosures because generalization is inefficient to protect
sensitive values and the partition of equivalence groups is directly shown to
the adversary. Besides, the generalized table also suffers from serious
information loss because the original Quasi-Identifier (QI) values are hardly
preserved and the protection against attribute disclosure often causes
over-protection against identity disclosure. To this end, we propose a novel
technique, called mutual cover, to hinder the adversary from matching the
combination of QI values in microdata tables. The rationale is to replace the
original QI values with random QI values according to some random output tables
that make similar tuples to cover for each other at the minimal cost. As a
result, the mutual cover prevents identity disclosure and attribute disclosure
more effectively than generalization while retaining the distribution of
original QI values as far as possible, and the information utility hardly
decreases when enhancing the protection for sensitive values. The effectiveness
of mutual cover is verified with extensive experiments.

laboratory study, we used a simulated search task to examine contextual and
interstitial disinformation warning designs. We found that users routinely
ignore contextual warnings, but users notice interstitial warnings -- and
respond by seeking information from alternative sources. We then conducted a
follow-on crowdworker study with eight interstitial warning designs. We
confirmed a significant impact on user information-seeking behavior, and we
found that a warning's design could effectively inform users or convey a risk
of harm. We also found, however, that neither user comprehension nor fear of
harm moderated behavioral effects. Our work provides evidence that
disinformation warnings can -- when designed well -- help users identify and
avoid disinformation. We show a path forward for designing effective warnings,
and we contribute repeatable methods for evaluating behavioral effects. We also
surface a possible dilemma: disinformation warnings might be able to inform
users and guide behavior, but the behavioral effects might result from user

designing efficient and sustainable transport models. Drivers' delivery
strategy is well understood, but their search strategy and learning process
still lack an empirically validated model. Here we provide a game-theoretic
model of driver search strategy and learning dynamics, interpret the collective
outcome in a thermodynamic framework, and verify its various implications
empirically. We capture driver search strategies in a multi-market oligopoly
model, which has a unique Nash equilibrium and is globally asymptotically
stable. The equilibrium can therefore be obtained via heuristic learning rules
where drivers pursue the incentive gradient or simply imitate others. To help
understand city-scale phenomena, we offer a macroscopic view with the laws of
thermodynamics. With 870 million trips of over 50k drivers in New York City, we
show that the equilibrium well explains the spatiotemporal patterns of driver
search behavior, and estimate an empirical constitutive relation. We find that
new drivers learn the equilibrium within a year, and those who stay longer
learn better. The collective response to new competition is also as predicted.
Among empirical studies of driver strategy in on-demand services, our work
examines the longest period, the most trips, and is the largest for taxi
industry.

to be transmitted to a data processing center. However, planning the trajectory
of a collaborative UAV swarm depends on multi-fold constraints, such as data
collection requirements, UAV maneuvering capacity, and budget limitation. Since
a UAV may fail or be compromised, it is important to provide necessary
resilience to such contingencies, thus ensuring data security. It is important
to provide the UAVs with efficient spatio-temporal trajectories so that they
can efficiently cover necessary data sources. In this work, we present
Synth4UAV, a formal approach for automated synthesis of efficient trajectories
for a UAV swarm by logically modeling the aerial space and data point topology,
UAV moves, and associated constraints in terms of the turning and climbing
angle, fuel usage, data collection point coverage, data freshness, and
resiliency properties. We use efficient, logical formulas to encode and solve
the complex model. The solution to the model provides the routing and

paths and corresponding fuel usage such that the necessary data points are
visited while satisfying the resiliency requirements. We evaluate the proposed

$\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N(N\leq4)$ with smooth boundary, where the

proposed by Keller and Segel in \cite{Keller-1} to describe the aggregation
phase of Dictyostelium discoideum cells, where the two motility functions
satisfy a proportional relation $\chi(v)=(\alpha -1)\gamma'(v)$ with $\alpha>0$
denoting the ratio of effective body length (i.e. distance between receptors)

possible degeneracy of diffusion. In this work, we show that if $\gamma(v)>0$

\frac{d\gamma(v)}{v\phi(v)(v\phi(v)+d-\gamma(v))_+}>\frac{N}{2},$$ then the

classical solutions uniformly bounded in time. The main idea of proving our
results is the estimates of a weighted functional $\int_\Omega u^{p}v^{-q}dx$
for $p>\frac{N}{2}$ by choosing a suitable exponent $p$ depending on the

discrepancy when transferring knowledge from a labeled source domain to an
unlabeled target domain. Previous UDA methods assume that the source and target
domains share an identical label space, which is unrealistic in practice since
the label information of the target domain is agnostic. This paper focuses on a
more realistic UDA scenario, i.e. partial domain adaptation (PDA), where the
target label space is subsumed to the source label space. In the PDA scenario,
the source outliers that are absent in the target domain may be wrongly matched
to the target domain (technically named negative transfer), leading to
performance degradation of UDA methods. This paper proposes a novel Target
Domain Specific Classifier Learning-based Domain Adaptation (TSCDA) method.
TSCDA presents a soft-weighed maximum mean discrepancy criterion to partially
align feature distributions and alleviate negative transfer. Also, it learns a
target-specific classifier for the target domain with pseudo-labels and
multiple auxiliary classifiers, to further address classifier shift. A module
named Peers Assisted Learning is used to minimize the prediction difference
between multiple target-specific classifiers, which makes the classifiers more
discriminant for the target domain. Extensive experiments conducted on three
PDA benchmark datasets show that TSCDA outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods with a large margin, e.g. $4\%$ and $5.6\%$ averagely on Office-31 and
Office-Home, respectively.

fractional quantum-Hall states, respectively. The quantum computational
performance of the different anyon models is quantified at single qubit level
by the difference between a target unitary operator and its approximation
realised by anyon braiding. To facilitate efficient comparisons, we have
developed a Monte Carlo enhanced Solovay-Kitaev quantum compiler algorithm that
finds optimal braid words in polynomial time from the exponentially large
search tree. Since universal quantum computation cannot be achieved within the
Ising anyon model by braiding alone, we have introduced an additional
elementary phase gate to model a non-topological measurement process, which
restores universality of the anyon model at the cost of breaking the full
topological protection. We model conventional kinds of decoherence processes
algorithmically by introducing a controllable noise term to all non-topological
gate operations. We find that for reasonable levels of decoherence, even the
hybrid Ising anyon model retains a significant topological advantage over a
conventional, non-topological, quantum computer. Furthermore, we find that only
surprisingly short anyon braids are ever required to be compiled due to the
gate noise exceeding the intrinsic error of the braid words already for word
lengths of the order of $100$ elementary braids. We conclude that the future

While this noncommutativity issue originates from the pinching singularity at

would violate the axial-vector Ward identity and as a result a modification of
the longitudinal component of the axial-vector vertex is required, which
contributes to CME. The pinching singularity with free fermion propagators was
then taken over by the singularity stemming from the dressed axial-vector

general the vanishing CME in the limit order that the static limit was taken
prior to the homogeneous limit in the light of Coleman-Hill theorem for a

vision. Classical model-based methods and recent deep learning (DL)-based
methods represent two different methodologies for this problem, each with their
own merits and drawbacks. In this paper, we propose a novel blind image
restoration method, aiming to integrate both the advantages of them.
Specifically, we construct a general Bayesian generative model for the blind
IR, which explicitly depicts the degradation process. In this proposed model, a
pixel-wise non-i.i.d. Gaussian distribution is employed to fit the image noise.
It is with more flexibility than the simple i.i.d. Gaussian or Laplacian
distributions as adopted in most of conventional methods, so as to handle more
complicated noise types contained in the image degradation. To solve the model,
we design a variational inference algorithm where all the expected posteriori
distributions are parameterized as deep neural networks to increase their model
capability. Notably, such an inference algorithm induces a unified framework to
jointly deal with the tasks of degradation estimation and image restoration.
Further, the degradation information estimated in the former task is utilized
to guide the latter IR process. Experiments on two typical blind IR tasks,
namely image denoising and super-resolution, demonstrate that the proposed
method achieves superior performance over current state-of-the-arts.

decentralized user data is increasingly harder to collect, by recommendation

regulations such as Europe's General Data Privacy Regulations(GDPR). Federated
Learning(FL) is a newly developed privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm
to bridge data repositories without compromising data security and privacy.
Thus many federated recommendation(FedRec) algorithms have been proposed to
realize personalized privacy-preserving recommendations. However, existing
FedRec algorithms, mostly extended from traditional collaborative filtering(CF)
method, cannot address cold-start problem well. In addition, their performance
overhead w.r.t. model accuracy, trained in a federated setting, is often
non-negligible comparing to centralized recommendations. This paper studies
this issue and presents FL-MV-DSSM, a generic content-based federated
multi-view recommendation framework that not only addresses the cold-start
problem, but also significantly boosts the recommendation performance by
learning a federated model from multiple data source for capturing richer
user-level features. The new federated multi-view setting, proposed by
FL-MV-DSSM, opens new usage models and brings in new security challenges to FL

empirical evaluations on FL-MV-DSSM and its variations with public datasets

is realized in collinear magnets when cluster and bond multipoles contain the

noncollinear antiferromagnets when a bond-type magnetic toroidal multipole is

correlations between the spectral parameters of the MSPs and the spin-down rate

consistently be described as arising from a common evolutionary trajectory for

cannot provide the required energy for the interpretation of GeV afterglow
emission and a baryonic poor outflow is additionally needed to explain the
afterglow emission. A baryonic rich outflow is also viable, as it can explain
the variability and observed quasi-thermal spectrum of the prompt emission if
dissipation is happening below the photosphere via internal shocks. Using the
peak energy ($E_p$) of the time-resolved prompt emission spectra and their
fluxes ($F_p$), we found correlation between $E_p$ and $F_p$ or $E_p$ and
isotropic luminosity $L_{\rm iso}$ for GRB 200415A. This supports the intrinsic
nature of $E_p$-$E_{\rm iso}$ correlation found in SGRs-GFs, hence favoring a

later time. However, binary black hole formation and subsequent merger events
are significantly reduced compared to the prediction when the present-day IMBH
mass is more massive than $\sim10^4 \rm M_{\odot}$ or the present-day IMBH mass
exceeds about 1 per cent of cluster's initial total mass. By examining the
maximum black hole mass in the system at the moment of black hole binary
escaping, we find that $\sim$ 90 per cent of the merging binary black holes
escape before the formation and growth of the IMBH. Furthermore, large fraction
of stellar mass black holes are merged into the IMBH or escape as single black
holes from globular clusters in cases of massive IMBHs, which can lead to the
significant under-population of binary black holes merging with gravitational

that are developed are a combination of multiple building blocks, making
comparison among them a tedious task. Finally, most of the work surrounding
image denoising presents performance results based on Peak-Signal-to-Noise
Ratio (PSNR) between a denoised image and a reference image (which is perturbed
with Additive White Gaussian Noise). This paper starts with a statistical
analysis on non-local similarity and its effectiveness under various noise
levels, followed by a theoretical comparison of different state-of-the-art
image denoising algorithms. Finally, we argue for a methodological overhaul to
incorporate no-reference image quality measures and unprocessed images (raw)
during performance evaluation of image denoising algorithms.

phases leading to an upper critical temperature for magnetism,
superconductivity, and other phenomena. A notable exception is the Pomeranchuk
effect in 3He, in which the liquid ground state freezes upon increasing the
temperature due to the large entropy of the paramagnetic solid phase. Here we
show that a similar mechanism describes the finite temperature dynamics of spin
and valley-isospins in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Most strikingly a
resistivity peak appears at high temperatures near superlattice filling factor
nu = -1, despite no signs of a commensurate correlated phase appearing in the
low-temperature limit. Tilted field magnetotransport and thermodynamic
measurements of the inplane magnetic moment show that the resistivity peak is
adiabatically connected to a finite-field magnetic phase transition at which
the system develops finite isospin polarization. These data are suggestive of a
Pomeranchuk-type mechanism, in which the entropy of disordered isospin moments
in the ferromagnetic phase stabilizes it relative to an isospin unpolarized
Fermi liquid phase at elevated temperatures. Measurements of the entropy, S/kB
indeed find it to be of order unity per unit cell area, with a measurable
fraction that is suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field consistent with a
contribution from disordered physical spins. In contrast to 3He, however, no
discontinuities are observed in the thermodynamic quantities across this
transition. Our findings imply a small isospin stiffness, with implications for
the nature of finite temperature transport as well as the mechanisms underlying

significant guidance for the recovery of the unobserved pixels' depth. However,
due to the sparsity of the depth data, the standard convolution operation,
exploited by most of existing methods, is not effective to model the observed
contexts with depth values. To address this issue, we propose to adopt the
graph propagation to capture the observed spatial contexts. Specifically, we
first construct multiple graphs at different scales from observed pixels. Since
the graph structure varies from sample to sample, we then apply the attention
mechanism on the propagation, which encourages the network to model the
contextual information adaptively. Furthermore, considering the mutli-modality
of input data, we exploit the graph propagation on the two modalities
respectively to extract multi-modal representations. Finally, we introduce the
symmetric gated fusion strategy to exploit the extracted multi-modal features
effectively. The proposed strategy preserves the original information for one
modality and also absorbs complementary information from the other through
learning the adaptive gating weights. Our model, named Adaptive Context-Aware

user using the principle of NOMA, where the entrusted users harvest energy from
the received light intensity, decode the legitimate user's message, forward it
using a RF link, and then decode their messages. It is required to maximize the

nature, which can lead to the chiral patterning of cells and even to the
left-right symmetry breaking in our body. The general mechanism of how the
dynamics of bio-matters can couple with its own inherent chirality to produce
macroscopic patterns is yet to be elucidated. Here we report that cultured
neural progenitor cells (NPCs), which undergo self-propelled motion with
nematic cell-to-cell interactions, exhibit large scale chiral patterns when
flowing out from containers made by gel. Moreover, a robust chiral cell flow is
produced along the boundary when the NPCs are cultured on substrates with

chirality, resulting in the switching of the direction of the chiral patterning

non-Hermitian Schrodinger equation, we find an edge-localized unidirectional
mode in the Fourier spectrum of the cell density, which corresponds to the
topological Kelvin wave. These results establish a novel mechanism of flow that
emerges from a pool of bipolar cells, and demonstrate how topological concepts
from condensed matter physics can naturally arise in chiral active systems and

dynamics with adaptive human behavior during a disease outbreak, considering

application scenario is that commuters may adjust their behavior upon observing
the symptoms and countermeasures from their physical contacts during travel,
thus altering the trajectories of a disease outbreak. We introduce the
heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) approach in a multiplex network setting to
jointly model the spreading dynamics of the infectious disease in the contact
network and the dissemination dynamics of information in the observation
network. The disease spreading is captured using the classic
susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) process, while an SIS-alike process
models the spread of awareness termed as unaware-aware-unaware (UAU). And the
use of multiplex network helps capture the interplay between disease spreading
and information dissemination, and how the dynamics of one may affect the
other. Theoretical analyses suggest that there are three potential equilibrium
states, depending on the percolation strength of diseases and information. The
dissemination of information may help shape herd immunity among the population,
thus suppressing and eradicating the disease outbreak. Finally, numerical
experiments using the contact networks among metro travelers are provided to
shed light on the disease and information dynamics in the real-world scenarios
and gain insights on the resilience of transportation system against the risk

of (1) the route generation step to and from the activity hub with connectivity
to existing transit systems, and (2) the robust route scheduling step which
determines the vehicle assignment and route headway under demand uncertainty.
Efficient exact and heuristic algorithms are developed for identifying the
minimum number of routes that maximize passenger coverage, and a matching
scheme is proposed to combine routes to and from the hub into roundtrips
optimally. With the generated routes, the robust route scheduling problem is
formulated as a two-stage robust optimization problem. Model reformulations are
introduced to solve the robust optimization problem into the global optimum. In
this regard, the proposed framework presents both algorithmic and analytic
solutions for developing the hub-based transit services in response to the
varying passenger demand over a short-time period. To validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework, comprehensive numerical experiments
are conducted for planning the HHMoD services at the JFK airport in New York
City (NYC). The results show the superior performance of the proposed route
generation algorithm to maximize the citywide coverage more efficiently. The
results also demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the robust route schedules
under normal demand conditions and against worst-case-oriented realizations of
passenger demand.

reinforcement learning (DRL), to replace the conventional update rule, given as
an exponential moving average. The target network is for smoothly generating
the reference signals for a main network in DRL, thereby reducing learning
variance. The problem with its conventional update rule is the fact that all
the parameters are smoothly copied with the same speed from the main network,
even when some of them are trying to update toward the wrong directions. This
behavior increases the risk of generating the wrong reference signals. Although
slowing down the overall update speed is a naive way to mitigate wrong updates,
it would decrease learning speed. To robustly update the parameters while
keeping learning speed, a t-soft update method, which is inspired by student-t
distribution, is derived with reference to the analogy between the exponential
moving average and the normal distribution. Through the analysis of the derived
t-soft update, we show that it takes over the properties of the student-t
distribution. Specifically, with a heavy-tailed property of the student-t
distribution, the t-soft update automatically excludes extreme updates that
differ from past experiences. In addition, when the updates are similar to the
past experiences, it can mitigate the learning delay by increasing the amount
of updates. In PyBullet robotics simulations for DRL, an online actor-critic
algorithm with the t-soft update outperformed the conventional methods in terms
of the obtained return and/or its variance. From the training process by the
t-soft update, we found that the t-soft update is globally consistent with the

  Context","PhD thesis",,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The amount of data for processing and categorization grows at an ever
increasing rate. At the same time the demand for collaboration and transparency
in organizations, government and businesses, drives the release of data from
internal repositories to the public or 3rd party domain. This in turn increase
the potential of sharing sensitive information. The leak of sensitive
information can potentially be very costly, both financially for organizations,
but also for individuals. In this work we address the important problem of
sensitive information detection. Specially we focus on detection in
unstructured text documents.
  We show that simplistic, brittle rule sets for detecting sensitive
information only find a small fraction of the actual sensitive information.
Furthermore we show that previous state-of-the-art approaches have been
implicitly tailored to such simplistic scenarios and thus fail to detect actual
sensitive content. We develop a novel family of sensitive information detection
approaches which only assumes access to labeled examples, rather than
unrealistic assumptions such as access to a set of generating rules or
descriptive topical seed words. Our approaches are inspired by the current
state-of-the-art for paraphrase detection and we adapt deep learning approaches
over recursive neural networks to the problem of sensitive information
detection. We show that our context-based approaches significantly outperforms
the family of previous state-of-the-art approaches for sensitive information
detection, so-called keyword-based approaches, on real-world data and with
human labeled examples of sensitive and non-sensitive documents.

the respective poles by solving an optimization problem. If the frequency
surrogates are constructed by a suitable rational interpolation strategy,
frequency and parameters can both be sampled in an adaptive fashion. This, in
general, yields frequency surrogates with different numbers of poles, a
situation addressed by our proposed algorithm. Moreover, we explain how our
method can be applied even in high-dimensional settings, by employing
locally-refined sparse grids in parameter space to weaken the curse of
dimensionality. Numerical examples are used to showcase the effectiveness of
the method, and to highlight some of its limitations in dealing with unbalanced
pole matching, as well as with a large number of parameters.

to learn in non-stationary environments, in which the underlying data
distribution changes over time. A typical scenario is the domain drift, i.e.
different domains of data come one after another, where the MRC model is
required to adapt to the new domain while maintaining previously learned
ability. To tackle such a challenge, in this work, we introduce the
\textit{Continual Domain Adaptation} (CDA) task for MRC. So far as we know,
this is the first study on the continual learning perspective of MRC. We build
two benchmark datasets for the CDA task, by re-organizing existing MRC
collections into different domains with respect to context type and question
type, respectively. We then analyze and observe the catastrophic forgetting

cylinder with a radius of 700 pc around the Sun extending to |Z|=1800 pc.
Accurate data of these stars in the Gaia DR2 GRP and WISE W3 bands have allowed
the spatial GRP-W3 color variations to be used to calculate the model
parameters and two characteristics of the sample, the mode of the dereddened
color (GRP-W3)0 of the giant clump and the linear change of this mode with
coordinate |Z|. As a result, an improved version of the three-dimensional model
first proposed by Gontcharov (2009b) has been obtained. As in the previous
version, the model suggests two dust layers, along the Galactic equator and in
the Gould Belt, that intersect near the Sun at an angle of 18\pm2 degs. In
contrast to the previous version of the model with a midplane of the Gould Belt
dust layer in the form of a circle with the center at the Sun, in the new
version this midplane is an ellipse decentered relative to the Sun. A scale
height of 170\pm40 pc has been found for both dust layers. The modes of the
absolute magnitude MW3=-1.70\pm0.02 and the dereddened color
(GRP-W3)0=(1.43\pm0.01)-(0.020\pm0.007)|Z|, where Z is expressed in kpc, have
been calculated for the giant clump near the Sun. The dispersions of the
quantities under consideration have allowed the natural small-scale density
fluctuations of the dust medium relative to the mean reddening calculated from
the model to be characterized. These fluctuations make a major contribution to
the uncertainty in the reddening.

in society. They have a wide range of applications to help either the elderly
and disabled to walk or to treat certain illnesses or for post-operative
rehabilitation. But there are many different types of crutches, including
shoulder crutches and elbow crutches. How to choose has become an issue that
deserves to be debated. Because while crutches help people walk, they also have
an impact on the body. Inappropriate choice of crutches or long-term misuse can
lead to problems such as scoliosis. Previous studies were mainly experimental
measurements or the construction of dynamic models to calculate the load on
joints with crutches. These studies focus only on the level of the joints,
ignoring the role that muscles play in this process. Although some also take
into account the degree of muscle activation, there is still a lack of
quantitative analysis. The traditional dynamic model can be used to calculate
the load on each joint. However, due to the activation of the muscle, this
situation only causes part of the load transmitted to the joint, and the work

level allows a better understanding of the impact of crutches on the body. By
comparing the levels of activation of the trunk muscles, it was found that the
use of crutches for walking, especially a single crutch, can cause a large
difference in the activation of the back muscles on the left and right sides,
and this difference will cause muscle degeneration for a long time, leading to
scoliosis. In this article taking scoliosis as an example, by analyzing the
muscles around the spine, we can better understand the pathology and can better
prevent diseases. The objective of this article is to analyze normal walking
compared to walking with one or two crutches using OpenSim software to obtain
the degree of activation of different muscles in order to analyze the impact of
crutches on the body.

which has attracted continuous attention through the past decades. Many
different tasks have been proposed for understanding users' search queries,
e.g., query classification or query clustering. However, it is not that precise
to understand a search query at the intent class/cluster level due to the loss
of many detailed information. As we may find in many benchmark datasets, e.g.,
TREC and SemEval, queries are often associated with a detailed description
provided by human annotators which clearly describes its intent to help
evaluate the relevance of the documents. If a system could automatically
generate a detailed and precise intent description for a search query, like
human annotators, that would indicate much better query understanding has been
achieved. In this paper, therefore, we propose a novel
Query-to-Intent-Description (Q2ID) task for query understanding. Unlike those
existing ranking tasks which leverage the query and its description to compute
the relevance of documents, Q2ID is a reverse task which aims to generate a
natural language intent description based on both relevant and irrelevant
documents of a given query. To address this new task, we propose a novel
Contrastive Generation model, namely CtrsGen for short, to generate the intent
description by contrasting the relevant documents with the irrelevant documents
given a query. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model by comparing with
several state-of-the-art generation models on the Q2ID task. We discuss the
potential usage of such Q2ID technique through an example application.

mesoscopic scales, studies have been focused on the limit of the energy
dissipation in an open system by refining the concept of the Maxwell's demon.
The well-known Sagawa-Ueda fluctuation theorem provides an explanation of the
demon: the absence of a part of demon's information leads to an improper
entropy production which violates the thermodynamic 2nd law. Realizing that the
demon contributes not only to the system but also to the environments, we
introduce the dissipative information to quantify the total contribution of the
demon, rather than using an improper entropy production. We prove a set of new
fluctuation theorems based on this, which can be used to uncover the truth
behind the demon: The controlled system does not violate the 2nd law at any
coarse-grained level for the demon's control. However, there exists an
inevitable demon-induced dissipative information which always increases the
entropy production. A consequence of these theorems is that, less work and more
heat can be extracted and generated respectively by a demon than the limits
predicted by the Ueda-Sagawa theorem. We also suggest a possible realization of
the experimental estimation of these work and heat bounds, which can be
measured and tested.

  In this work, we propose a framework of decentralized asset custody scheme
that is able to support a large number of custodians and safely hold customer

custody scheme distributes custodians and assets into many custodian groups via
combinatorial designs, where each group fully controls the assigned assets.
Since every custodian group is small, the overhead cost is significantly
reduced. The liveness is also improved because even a single alive group would
be able to process transactions.
  The security of this custody scheme is guaranteed under the rational
adversary model, such that any adversary corrupting a bounded fraction of

analyze the security and performance of our constructions from both theoretical

This paper generalizes this result to a cooperative cellular network, in which
remote access-points are deployed as relays in serving the users under the
coordination of a central processor (CP). In this model, the users and the
relays are connected over noisy wireless links, while the relays and the CP are
connected over noiseless but rate-limited fronthaul links. Based on a

such a multiple-access relay channel and broadcast relay channel, under the

are used. The key observations are that if the beamforming vectors at the
relays are fixed, the sum-power minimization problems under the achievable rate
and fronthaul constraints in both the uplink and the downlink can be
transformed into either a linear programming or a semidefinite programming
problem depending on the compression technique, and that the uplink and
downlink problems are Lagrangian duals of each other. Moreover, the dual
variables corresponding to the downlink rate constraints become the uplink
powers; the dual variables corresponding to the downlink fronthaul constraints
become the uplink quantization noises. This duality relationship enables an
efficient algorithm for optimizing the downlink transmission and relaying
strategies based on the uplink.

where matching ambiguity is difficult to resolve even with learned deep
features. We tackle this problem by taking into account the confidence in

errors. Specifically, we introduce a Confidence-Aware Semantic Matching Network
(CAMNet) which instantiates two key ideas of our approach. First, we propose to
estimate a dense confidence map for a matching prediction through
self-supervised learning. Second, based on the estimated confidence, we refine
initial predictions by propagating reliable matching to the rest of locations
on the image plane. In addition, we develop a new hybrid loss in which we
integrate a semantic alignment loss with a confidence loss, and an adversarial
loss that measures the quality of semantic correspondence. We are the first
that exploit confidence during refinement to improve semantic matching accuracy
and develop an end-to-end self-supervised adversarial learning procedure for
the entire matching network. We evaluate our method on two public benchmarks,
on which we achieve top performance over the prior state of the art. We will

insight into the dynamics of transitional and turbulent flows and can provide a
model for the dominant coherent structures within the flow, particularly for
flows with large gain separation. Direct computation of force and response
modes using a singular value decomposition of the full resolvent matrix is
feasible only for simple problems; despite recent progress, the cost of
resolvent analysis for complex flows remains considerable. In this paper, we
propose a new matrix-free method for computing resolvent modes based on
integration of the linearized equations and the corresponding adjoint system in
the time domain. Our approach achieves an order of magnitude speedup when
compared to previous matrix-free time stepping methods by enabling all
frequencies of interest to be computed simultaneously. Two different methods
are presented: one based on analysis of the transient response, providing
leading modes with fine frequency discretization; and another based on the
steady-state response to a periodic forcing, providing optimal and suboptimal
modes for a discrete set of frequencies. The methods are validated using a
linearized Ginzburg-Landau equation and applied to the three dimensional flow
around a parabolic body.

Within the literary texts, a distinction is made between canonical and
non-canonical works. The central hypothesis of the study is that the three text
types (non-literary, literary/canonical and literary/non-canonical) exhibit
systematic differences with respect to structural design features as correlates
of aesthetic responses in readers. To investigate these differences, we
compiled a corpus containing texts of the three categories of interest, the
Jena Textual Aesthetics Corpus. Two aspects of global structure are
investigated, variability and self-similar (fractal) patterns, which reflect
long-range correlations along texts. We use four types of basic observations,
(i) the frequency of POS-tags per sentence, (ii) sentence length, (iii) lexical
diversity in chunks of text, and (iv) the distribution of topic probabilities
in chunks of texts. These basic observations are grouped into two more general
categories, (a) the low-level properties (i) and (ii), which are observed at
the level of the sentence (reflecting linguistic decoding), and (b) the
high-level properties (iii) and (iv), which are observed at the textual level
(reflecting comprehension). The basic observations are transformed into time
series, and these time series are subject to multifractal detrended fluctuation
analysis (MFDFA). Our results show that low-level properties of texts are
better discriminators than high-level properties, for the three text types
under analysis. Canonical literary texts differ from non-canonical ones
primarily in terms of variability. Fractality seems to be a universal feature
of text, more pronounced in non-literary than in literary texts. Beyond the
specific results of the study, we intend to open up new perspectives on the
experimental study of textual aesthetics.

However, currently, loop-shaping is achieved using the describing function (DF)
and performance analysed using linear control sensitivity functions not

the wider adaptation of reset control with two contributions in this paper.
First, we present the extension of frequency-domain tools for reset controllers

two-scale constitutive model for shale in which anisotropic viscoplastic
behavior naturally emerges from semi-analytical homogenization of a bi-layer

representing a ductile matrix formed by clay and organics, and hard layers,
corresponding to a brittle matrix composed of stiff minerals. This layered
microstructure renders the macroscopic behavior anisotropic, even when the
individual layers are modeled with isotropic constitutive laws. Using a common
correlation between clay and organic content and magnitude of creep, we apply a
viscoplastic Modified Cam-Clay plasticity model to the soft layers, while
treating the hard layers as a linear elastic material to minimize the number of
calibration parameters. We then describe the implementation of the proposed
model in a standard material update subroutine. The model is validated with
laboratory creep data on samples from three gas shale formations. We also
demonstrate the computational behavior of the proposed model through simulation

in the thermodynamic limit and are associated with the divergence of the linear

in the linear response that can be framed in the context of critical
transitions. Finally, we show how our results can elucidate the properties of

time belongs to the large class of ${\cal PC}$ kernels. In particular, the case
of a fractional time derivative of order less than 1 is included. A key
ingredient in the proof is a new compactness criterion of Aubin-Lions type
which involves function spaces defined in terms of the integro-differential
operator in time. Boundedness of the solution is obtained by the De Giorgi

represent a valuable tool for different branches in the chemical and physical

predictions. In a recent publication (arXiv:1709.05075 [physics.chem-ph]), Hait
and Head-Gordon took a first step in this regard by providing recommendations
on the best density functionals suitable for these purposes. However, no
extensive study has been performed to provide recommendations on the basis set
choice. Here, we shed some light into this matter by evaluating the performance
of 38 general-purpose basis sets of single up to triple zeta-quality, when
coupled with nine different levels of theory, in the computation of dipole
moments. The calculations were performed on a data set with 114 small molecules
containing second- and third-row elements. We based our analysis in regularised
root mean square errors (regularised RMSE) as this procedure ensures relative
errors for ionic species and absolute errors for species with small dipole
moment values. Our results indicate that the best compromise between accuracy
and computational efficiency is achieved by performing the computations with an
augmented double zeta-quality basis set (i.e. aug-pc-1, aug-pcseg-1,
aug-cc-pVDZ) together with a hybrid functional (e.g. wB97X-V, SOGGA11-X).
Augmented triple-zeta basis sets could enhance the accuracy of the
computations, but the computational cost of introducing such a basis set is
substantial compared with the small improvement provided. These findings also
highlight the crucial role that augmentation of the basis set with diffuse
functions on both hydrogen and non-hydrogen atoms plays in the computation of
dipole moments.

is used to communicate among Electronic Control Units (ECUs) and has been
de-facto standard. CAN is simple and has several vulnerabilities such as unable
to distinguish spoofing messages because it does not support any authentication
or sender identification properties. In previous work, some voltage-based
methods to identify the sender node have been proposed. The methods can
identify ECUs with high accuracy. However, the accuracy of source
identification depends on a feature that is extracted from a continuous
function of voltage use sampling. In general, as the sampling rate increases,
the accuracy of identification is improved. Though the amount of data used for
the identification increases too. Hence, it is desired to create an Intrusion
Detection System (IDS) that identifies ECUs using few sampling features as
there is a limited computing resource in vehicles. In this paper, we propose a
delay-time based sender identification method of ECUs. We confirm that the
proposed method achieved a true positive rate of 96.7% in CAN bus prototype
against spoofing attack from a compromised ECU, detecting spoofing attack from
an unmonitored ECU with a true positive rate of 98.0% in real-vehicle.

deviation from uniformity (p-value < $10^{-5}$) in the 2D analysis at angular
scales of about four degrees, mainly caused by sources with the largest flux

We further review briefly the few existing univariate tests under dependence

union-intersection principle to decompose the null hypothesis into
intersections of univariate normality hypotheses for projection data, and it
rejects the multivariate normality if any individual hypothesis is rejected.
The individual hypotheses for univariate normality are conducted using a

are intimately related to Coxeter groups of smallest rank. For $n=2$ and $3$,
these Coxeter groups are given by the triangle group $[7,3]$ and the
tetrahedral group $[3,5,3]$, and they are also distinguished by the fact that
they have minimal growth rate among all cocompact hyperbolic Coxeter groups in
$\hbox{Isom}\mathbb H^n$, respectively. In this work, we consider the cocompact
Coxeter simplex group $G_4$ with Coxeter symbol $[5,3,3,3]$ in
$\hbox{Isom}\mathbb H^4$ and the cocompact Coxeter prism group $G_5$ based on
$[5,3,3,3,3]$ in $\hbox{Isom}\mathbb H^5$. Both groups are arithmetic and
related to the fundamental group of the minimal volume arithmetic compact
hyperbolic $n$-orbifold for $n=4$ and $5$, respectively. Here, we prove that
the group $G_n$ is distinguished by having smallest growth rate among all
Coxeter groups acting cocompactly on $\mathbb H^n$ for $n=4$ and $5$,

hyperbolic Coxeter polyhedra, some partial classification results and certain
monotonicity properties of growth rates of the associated Coxeter groups.

macroeconomic model whereby physical power is fueling economic power. From 1820
to 1920, the linearity between global PEC and world GDP justifies basic
equations where, originally, PEC incorporates unskilled human labor that
consumes and converts energy from food. In a consistent model, both physical
capital and human capital are fed by PEC and represent a form of stored energy.
In the following century, from 1920 to 2016, GDP grows quicker than PEC.
Periods of quasi-linearity of the two variables are separated by distinct
jumps, which can be interpreted as radical technology shifts. The GDP to PEC
ratio accumulates game-changing innovation, at an average growth rate
proportional to PEC. These results seed alternative strategies for modeling and
for political management of the climate crisis and the energy transition.

galaxies from radio data, the radio SED is often assumed to be described by a
simple power law, usually with a spectral index of 0.7 for all sources. Even
though radio SEDs have been shown to exhibit deviations from this assumption,
both in differing spectral indices and complex spectral shapes, it is often
presumed that their individual differences cancel out in large samples. We
constructed the average radio SED of radio-excess active galactic nuclei
(RxAGN), defined as those that exhibit a 3 $\sigma$ radio luminosity excess
with respect to the value expected only from contribution from star formation,
out to z~4. We combined VLA observations of the COSMOS field at 1.4 GHz and 3
GHz with GMRT observations at 325 MHz and 610 MHz. To account for nondetections
in the GMRT maps, we employed the survival analysis technique. We selected a
sample of RxAGN out to z~4. We find that a sample of RxAGN can be described by
a spectral index of $\alpha_1=0.28\pm0.03$ below the break frequency
$\nu_b=(4.1\pm0.2)$ GHz and $\alpha_2=1.16\pm0.04$ above, while a simple
power-law model yields a single spectral index of $\alpha=0.64\pm0.07$. By
binning in 1.4 GHz radio luminosity and redshift, we find that the power-law
spectral index, as well as broken power-law spectral indices, may increase for
larger source sizes, while the power-law spectral index and lower-frequency (<4

Here, we carry out a comprehensive study of the $J$-$K$-$\Gamma$ model on the

the HK limit ($\Gamma=0$), we find five quantum phases which are quite similar

120$^\circ$ N\'{e}el phase also extends to a finite $\Gamma$, its region has
been largely reduced compared to the previous classical result. Interestingly,
the ferromagnetic (dubbed as FM-A) phase and the stripe-B phase are unstable in
response to an infinitesimal $\Gamma$ interaction. Moreover, we find five new
phases for $\Gamma\ne 0$ which are elaborated by both the quantum and classical
numerical methods. Part of the space previously identified as 120$^\circ$
N\'{e}el phase in the classical study is found to give way to the modulated
stripe phase. Depending on the sign of the $\Gamma$, the FM-A phase transits
into the FM-B ($\Gamma>0$) and FM-C ($\Gamma<0$) phase with different spin
orientations, and the stripe-B phase transits into the stripe-C ($\Gamma>0$)

application of the method. I compute asymptotic dipole mode frequencies as a
function of coupling factor and dipole period spacing, and other parameters.
For each star, I collapse the power in an echelle diagramme aligned onto the
monopole and dipole mixed modes. The power at the null frequency is used as a
figure of merit. Using a genetic algorithm, I then optimise the figure of merit
by adjusting the location of the dipole frequencies in the power spectrum}.
Using published frequencies, I compare the asymptotic dipole mode frequencies
with published frequencies. I also used published frequencies for deriving
coupling factor and dipole period spacing using a non-linear least squares fit.
I use Monte-Carlo simulations of the non-linear least square fit for deriving
error bars for each parameters. From the 44 subgiants studied, the automatic
identification allows to retrieve within 3 $\mu$Hz at least 80\% of the modes
for 32 stars, and within 6 $\mu$Hz at least 90% of the modes for 37 stars. The
optimised and fitted gravity-mode period spacing and coupling factor agree with
previous measurements. Random errors for the mixed-mode parameters deduced from
Monte-Carlo simulation are about 30-50 times smaller than previously determined
errors, which are in fact systematic errors. The period spacing and coupling
factors of mixed modes in subgiants are confirmed. The current automated
procedure will need to be improved using a more accurate asymptotic model

which allow to perform extended simulations of large systems at a small
fraction of the computational costs of electronic structure calculations. The
key to the success of modern ML potentials is the close-to first principles
quality description of the atomic interactions. This accuracy is reached by
using very flexible functional forms in combination with high-level reference
data from electronic structure calculations. These data sets can include up to
hundreds of thousands of structures covering millions of atomic environments to
ensure that all relevant features of the potential energy surface are well
represented. The handling of such large data sets is nowadays becoming one of
the main challenges in the construction of ML potentials. In this paper we
present a method, the bin-and-hash (BAH) algorithm, to overcome this problem by
enabling the efficient identification and comparison of large numbers of
multidimensional vectors. Such vectors emerge in multiple contexts in the
construction of ML potentials. Examples are the comparison of local atomic
environments to identify and avoid unnecessary redundant information in the
reference data sets that is costly in terms of both the electronic structure
calculations as well as the training process, the assessment of the quality of
the descriptors used as structural fingerprints in many types of ML potentials,
and the detection of possibly unreliable data points. The BAH algorithm is
illustrated for the example of high-dimensional neural network potentials using
atom-centered symmetry functions for the geometrical description of the atomic

fluctuations occur when the oscillator is coupled to a heat bath of temperature
$T$. At finite temperature quantum statistical mechanics allows the description
of the transition from pure quantum fluctuations at $T=0$ to classical thermal
fluctuations in the high temperature limit. It was early pointed out by Peierls
that the mean square thermal fluctuations in a {\it harmonic chain} increase
{\it linearly} with the distance of the atoms in the chain, destroying long
range crystalline order. The corresponding pure quantum fluctuations lead to a
much slower {\it logarithmic} increase with the distance from the fixed end of
the chain. It is also shown that this implies, for example, the absence of
sharp Bragg peaks in x-ray scattering in an infinite chain at zero temperature,

for adding space to accommodate volumetric expansion, electrolyte access to all
active materials, helping to mitigate poor C-rate performance for thicker
electrodes and for allowing infilling with other materials. Ordered porous
electrode, such as inverse opals that have macroporosity, have been a model
system: binder and conductive additive free, interconnected electrically,
defined porosity and pore size with thickness, good electrolyte wettability and
surprisingly good electrode performance in half cells and Li-battery cells at
normal rates. We show that the intrinsic electronic conductivity is important,
and at fast rates the intrinsic conductivity ultimately suppresses any charge
storage in electrode materials. Using a model system of inverse opal V2O5in a
flooded Li battery three-electrode cell, whose Li electrochemistry is very well
understood, we show that beyond 10 C, electrodes can store almost no charge,
but completely recover once reduced to < 1C. We show how the IO material is
modified under lithiation using X-ray diffraction, Raman scattering and
electron microscopy, and that little or no reaction occurs to the material at
higher rates. We also use chronoamperometry to examine rate behaviour and link
the limitations in high rate performance, and complete capacity suppression, to
the intrinsic out-of-plane conductivity of the IO network. The data show that
even idealized electrodes with nanoscale dimensions, functional porosity and
full material interconnectivity, are fundamentally limited for high rate
performance when they are less conductive even when fully soaked with
electrolyte. While adding so-called functional size reduction, porosity etc.
can be useful for some materials, these potential benefits are clearly not
universally useful for high rate electrodes in Li-ion batteries.

have to delineate potentially unequal relationships in terms of their relative
importance or direction. The intrinsic unequal relationships of such kind,
however, are opaque or hidden in numerous real systems. For instance, when a
node in a network with limited interaction capacity spends its capacity to its
neighboring nodes, the allocation of the total amount of interactions to them
can be vastly diverse. Even if such potentially heterogeneous interactions
epitomized by weighted networks are observable, as a result of the
aforementioned ego-centric allocation of interactions, the relative importance
or dependency between two interacting nodes can only be implicitly accessible.
In this work, we precisely pinpoint such relative dependency by proposing the
framework to discover hidden dependent relations extracted from weighted
networks. For a given weighted network, we provide a systematic criterion to
select the most essential interactions for individual nodes based on the
concept of information entropy. The criterion is symbolized by assigning the
effective number of neighbors or the effective out-degree to each node, and the
resultant directed subnetwork decodes the hidden dependent relations by leaving
only the most essential directed interactions. We apply our methodology to two
time-stamped empirical network data, namely the international trade relations
between nations in the world trade web (WTW) and the network of people in the
historical record of Korea, Annals of the Joseon Dynasty (AJD). Based on the
data analysis, we discover that the properties of mutual dependency encoded in
the two systems are vastly different.

aggregating multi-level features from fully convolutional network (FCN) and
introducing edge information as auxiliary supervision. Though remarkable
progress has been achieved, we observe that the closer the pixel is to the
edge, the more difficult it is to be predicted, because edge pixels have a very
imbalance distribution. To address this problem, we propose a label decoupling
framework (LDF) which consists of a label decoupling (LD) procedure and a
feature interaction network (FIN). LD explicitly decomposes the original
saliency map into body map and detail map, where body map concentrates on
center areas of objects and detail map focuses on regions around edges. Detail
map works better because it involves much more pixels than traditional edge
supervision. Different from saliency map, body map discards edge pixels and
only pays attention to center areas. This successfully avoids the distraction
from edge pixels during training. Therefore, we employ two branches in FIN to
deal with body map and detail map respectively. Feature interaction (FI) is
designed to fuse the two complementary branches to predict the saliency map,
which is then used to refine the two branches again. This iterative refinement
is helpful for learning better representations and more precise saliency maps.
Comprehensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that LDF
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on different evaluation metrics.

Background radiation is one of the current frontiers in cosmology. In
particular, the detection of the primordial B-modes, could reveal the presence
of gravitational waves in the early Universe. The detection of such component
is at the moment the most promising technique to probe the inflationary theory
describing the very early evolution of the Universe. We present the updated
performance forecast of the Large Scale Polarization Explorer (LSPE), a program
dedicated to the measurement of the CMB polarization. LSPE is composed of two
instruments: Strip, a radiometer-based telescope on the ground in Tenerife, and
SWIPE (Short-Wavelength Instrument for the Polarization Explorer) a
bolometer-based instrument designed to fly on a winter arctic stratospheric
long-duration balloon. The program is among the few dedicated to observation of
the Northern Hemisphere, while most of the international effort is focused into
ground-based observation in the Southern Hemisphere. Measurements are currently
scheduled in Winter 2021/22 for SWIPE, with a flight duration up to 15 days,
and in Summer 2021 with two years observations for Strip. We describe the main
features of the two instruments, identifying the most critical aspects of the
design, in terms of impact into performance forecast. We estimate the expected
sensitivity of each instrument and propagate their combined observing power to
the sensitivity to cosmological parameters, including the effect of scanning
strategy, component separation, residual foregrounds and partial sky coverage.
We also set requirements on the control of the most critical systematic effects
and describe techniques to mitigate their impact. LSPE can reach a sensitivity
in tensor-to-scalar ratio of $\sigma_r<0.01$, and improve constrains on other
cosmological parameters.

in previous experiments, we design our experiment such that (at least on
timescales relevant to our study) the false minimum is reached preferentially
in forward annealing due to high levels of quantum fluctuations. This allows us
to demonstrate the key principle of reverse annealing, that the solution space
can be searched locally, preferentially finding nearby solutions, even in the
presence of a false minimum. The techniques used here are, to the best of our
knowledge, distinct from previously used experimental techniques, and allow us
to probe the fundamental search range of the device in a way which has not been
previously explored. We perform these experiments on two flux qubit quantum
annealers, one with higher noise levels than the other. We find evidence that
the lower noise device is more likely to find the more distant energy minimum
(the false minimum in this case), suggesting that reducing noise fundamentally
increases the range over which flux qubit quantum annealers are able to search.
Our work explains why reducing the noise leads to improved performance on these
quantum annealers. This supports the idea that these devices may be able to
search over broad regions of the solution space quickly, one of the core
reasons why quantum annealers are viewed as a potential avenue for a quantum
computational advantage.

distant regions in full-face images. This mechanism can also create better and
more spatially-aware feature representations derived from the face and eye
images before gaze regression. We dubbed our framework ARes-gaze, which

DevOps context. This communication often takes place through deployment
diagrams of a system under development. However, it is common diagrams to
become ambiguous or inconsistent as the system progresses and goes to a
continuous delivery pipeline or production. Moreover, diagrams could not follow
the evolution of systems, and it is challenging to associate diagrams to
production. In this paper, we propose the use of system descriptors to address
the ambiguity of deployment diagrams. We state three main hypotheses (1) if a
deployment diagram is generated from a valid system descriptor then the diagram
is unambiguous; (2) if a valid system descriptor is generated from a deployment
diagram then the descriptor is unambiguous; (3) if a diagram $\mu$ generated
from a descriptor $A$ is unambiguous and if a descriptor $B$ is generated from
the diagram $\mu$ equally unambiguous then descriptors $A$ and $B$ are
equivalent. We report a case study to test our hypotheses. We constructed a
system descriptor from Netflix deployment diagram, and we applied our tool to
generate a new deployment diagram. Finally, we compare the original and
generated diagrams to evaluate our proposal. Our case study shows the generated
deployment diagrams are graphically equivalent to system descriptors and
eliminated ambiguous aspects of the original diagram. Thus, our preliminary
results lead to further evaluation in controlled and empirical experiments to
test our hypotheses conclusively.

various computer vision applications, and recently start to be deployed to
resource-constrained mobile devices. Similar to other deep models,
state-of-the-art GANs suffer from high parameter complexities. That has
recently motivated the exploration of compressing GANs (usually generators).
Compared to the vast literature and prevailing success in compressing deep
classifiers, the study of GAN compression remains in its infancy, so far
leveraging individual compression techniques instead of more sophisticated
combinations. We observe that due to the notorious instability of training
GANs, heuristically stacking different compression techniques will result in
unsatisfactory results. To this end, we propose the first unified optimization
framework combining multiple compression means for GAN compression, dubbed GAN
Slimming (GS). GS seamlessly integrates three mainstream compression
techniques: model distillation, channel pruning and quantization, together with
the GAN minimax objective, into one unified optimization form, that can be
efficiently optimized from end to end. Without bells and whistles, GS largely
outperforms existing options in compressing image-to-image translation GANs.
Specifically, we apply GS to compress CartoonGAN, a state-of-the-art style
transfer network, by up to 47 times, with minimal visual quality degradation.

growing trend of industry 4.0 and the availability of inexpensive sensors.
However, the adoption rate for predictive maintenance by companies remains low.
The majority of companies are sticking to corrective and preventive
maintenance. This is not due to a lack of information on the technical
implementation of predictive maintenance, with an abundance of research papers
on state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms that can be used effectively.
The main issue is that most upper management has not yet been fully convinced
of the idea of predictive maintenance. The economic value of the implementation
has to be linked to the predictive maintenance program for better justification
by the management. In this study, three machine learning models were trained to
demonstrate the economic value of predictive maintenance. Data was collected
from a testbed located at the Singapore University of Technology and Design.
The testbed closely resembles a real-world water treatment plant. A
cost-benefit analysis coupled with Monte Carlo simulation was proposed. It
provided a structured approach to document potential costs and savings by
implementing a predictive maintenance program. The simulation incorporated
real-world risk into a financial model. Financial figures were adapted from
CITIC Envirotech Ltd, a leading membrane-based integrated environmental
solutions provider. Two scenarios were used to elaborate on the economic values
of predictive maintenance. Overall, this study seeks to bridge the gap between
technical and business domains of predictive maintenance.

consists in first predicting pseudo-masks for the unlabeled pool of samples,

estimate of the Intersection Over Union (IoU) of the segment with the ground

nano/micro heat transfer and thermal management for advanced electronics. As
the thickness of thin films is comparable to or shorter than a phonon
wavelength, phonon dispersion relations and transport properties are
significantly modulated, which should be taken into account for heat conduction
in thin films. Although phonon confinement and depletion effects have been
considered, it should be emphasized that surface-localized phonons (surface
phonons) arise whose influence on heat conduction may not be negligible due to
the high surface-to-volume ratio. However, the role of surface phonons in heat
conduction has received little attention thus far. In the present work, we
performed anharmonic lattice dynamics calculations to investigate the thickness
and temperature dependence of in-plane thermal conductivity of silicon thin
films with sub-10-nm thickness in terms of surface phonons. Through systematic
analysis of the influences of surface phonons, we found that anharmonic
coupling between surface and internal phonons localized in thin films
significantly suppresses overall in-plane heat conduction in thin films. We

contribute to surface--internal phonon scattering and heat conduction
suppression. Our findings are beneficial for the thermal management of

demand locations with many similar trip requests. However, here we reveal that
people's willingness to share rides does not follow this trend. Modeling the
fundamental incentives underlying individual ride-sharing decisions, we find
two opposing adoption regimes, one with constant and another one with
decreasing adoption as demand increases. In the high demand limit, the
transition between these regimes becomes discontinuous, switching abruptly from
low to high ride-sharing adoption. Analyzing over 360 million ride requests in
New York City and Chicago illustrates that both regimes coexist across the
cities, consistent with our model predictions. These results suggest that even
a moderate increase in the financial incentives may have a disproportionately
large effect on the ride-sharing adoption of individual user groups.

trip-chaining behavior involving making stops of multiple purposes between two
anchors. According to the 2001 National Household Travel Survey, about one half
of weekday U.S. workers made a stop during their commute. In excess commuting
studies that examine a region's overall commuting efficiency, commuting is,
however, simplified as nonstop travel from homes to jobs. This research fills
this gap by proposing a trip-chaining-based model to integrate trip-chaining
behavior into excess commuting. Based on a case study of the Tampa Bay region
of Florida, this research finds that traditional excess commuting studies
underestimate both actual and optimal commute, while overestimate excess
commuting. For chained commuting trips alone, for example, the mean minimum
commute time is increased by 70 percent from 5.48 minutes to 9.32 minutes after
trip-chaining is accounted for. The gaps are found to vary across trip-chaining
types by a disaggregate analysis by types of chain activities. Hence,
policymakers and planners are cautioned of omitting trip-chaining behavior in
making urban transportation and land use policies. In addition, the proposed
model can be adopted to study the efficiency of non-work travel.

different MCS systems have different goals and there are possibly conflicting

Backtracking Gradient Descent and New Q-Newton's method to the Riemannian

where X is a general Riemannian manifold of finite dimension and
$f:X\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ a $C^2$ function which is Morse (that is, all its
critical points are non-degenerate).
  {\bf Theorem.} For random choices of the hyperparameters in the Riemanian
Local Backtracking Gradient Descent algorithm and for random choices of the
initial point $x_0$, the sequence $\{x_n\}$ constructed by the algorithm either
(i) converges to a local minimum of $f$ or (ii) eventually leaves every compact
subsets of $X$ (in other words, diverges to infinity on $X$). If $f$ has
compact sublevels, then only the former alternative happens. The convergence
rate is the same as in the classical paper by Armijo.
  {\bf Theorem.} Assume that $f$ is $C^3$. For random choices of the
hyperparametes in the Riemannian New Q-Newton's method, if the sequence
constructed by the algorithm converges, then the limit is a critical point of
$f$. We have a local Stable-Center manifold theorem, near saddle points of $f$,
for the dynamical system associated to the algorithm. If the limit point is a
non-degenerate minimum point, then the rate of convergence is quadratic. If
moreover $X$ is an open subset of a Lie group and the initial point $x_0$ is
chosen randomly, then we can globally avoid saddle points.
  As an application, we propose a general method using Riemannian Backtracking
GD to find minimum of a function on a bounded ball in a Euclidean space, and do
explicit calculations for calculating the smallest eigenvalue of a symmetric
square matrix.

desirable property to provide explanations that are proportional to the

study. Based on the long term spin-frequency evolution, the source is found to
spun up in the last 17 years. We observed a strongly energy-dependent pulse
profile that evolved from a complex broad structure in soft X-rays into a
profile with a narrow emission peak followed by a plateau in energy ranges
above 20 keV. This behaviour ensured a positive correlation between the energy
and pulse fraction. The pulse profile morphology and its energy-evolution are
almost similar during both the observations, suggesting a persistent emission
geometry of the pulsar over time. The broadband energy spectrum of the pulsar
is approximated by an absorbed high energy exponential cutoff power law model
with iron emission lines. In contrast to the previous report, we found no
statistical evidence for the presence of cyclotron absorption features in the
X-ray spectra. We performed phase-resolved spectroscopy by using data from the
NuSTAR observation. Our results showed a clear signature of absorbing material
at certain pulse-phases of the pulsar. These findings are discussed in terms of
stellar wind distribution and its effect on the beam geometry of this wind-fed
accreting neutron star. We also reviewed the subsonic quasi-spherical accretion

samples are not complete or homogeneous we obtain some first findings through
the comparison of a few intensity line ratios and nebular parameters. We find
that the ionized masses and the luminosities in H$\beta$, L$_{H\beta}$, of
around 30 objects previously identified as PNe indicate that they are most
likely compact HII regions. We find an anticorrelation between the electron
densities and the ionized masses in M31, M33, and NGC 300 which suggests that
most of the PNe observed in these galaxies are probably ionization bounded.
This trend is absent in LMC and SMC suggesting that many of their PNe are
density bounded. The He II/H$\beta$ values found in many PNe in LMC and some in
M33 and SMC are higher than in the other galaxies. Photoionization models
predict that these high values can only be reached in density bounded PNe. We
also find that the brightest PNe in the sample are not necessarily the youngest
since there is no correlation between electron densities and the H$\beta$
luminosities. The strong correlation found between L$_{H\beta}$-L$_{[O III]}$
implies that the so far not understood cut off of the planetary luminosity

star systems. We selected a huge set of initial conditions for planetary orbits
of the S-type, to perform high precision and very extended in time
integrations.
  For our numerical integrations, we resorted to the use of a 15th order
integration scheme (IAS15, available within the REBOUND framework), that
provides an optimal solution for long-term time integrations. We estimated the
probability of different types of instability: planet collisions with the
primary or secondary star or planet ejected away from the binary star system.
We confirm and generalize to massive planets the dependence of the critical
semi-major axis on eccentricity and mass ratio of the binary already found by
Holman and Wiegert (1999). We were also able to pick a significant number of
orbits that are only `marginally' stable, according to the classification
introduced by Musielak et al. (2005).
  A, natural, extension of this work has been the study of the effect of
perturbations induced to circumbinary planet motion by a passing-by star, like
it often happens in a star cluster. One of the targets of this analysis is the
investigation of the possibility that a planet, formerly on a stable S-type
orbit around one of the two stars, could transit to a stable P-type orbit (or
viceversa). We performed a series of more than 4500 scattering experiments with
different initial conditions typical of encounters in small star clusters. We
found some interesting behaviors of the systems after perturbation and showed
how a transition from an inner (S-type) stable orbit to a circumbinary (P-type)
(and vice-versa) has a very low (but non null) probability.

crystal cavities (PCCs) can augment the optical emission of the $V_{Si}^-$, yet
fine-tuning the defect-cavity interaction remains challenging. We report on two
post-fabrication processes that result in enhancement of the $V_1^{'}$ optical
emission from our 1-dimensional PCCs, indicating improved coupling between the
ensemble of silicon vacancies and the PCC. One process involves below bandgap
illumination at 785 nm and 532 nm wavelengths and above bandgap illumination at
325 nm, carried out at times ranging from a few minutes to several hours. The
other process is thermal annealing at $100^o C$, carried out over 20 minutes.
Every process except above bandgap irradiation improves the defect-cavity
coupling, manifested in augmented Purcell factor enhancement of the $V_1^{'}$
zero phonon line at 77K. The below bandgap laser process is attributed to a
modification of charge states, changing the relative ratio of $V_{Si}^0$ (dark
state) to $V_{Si}^-$ (bright state), while the thermal annealing process may be
explained by diffusion of carbon interstitials, $C_i$, that subsequently
recombine with other defects to create additional $V_{Si}^-$s. Above bandgap
radiation is proposed to initially convert $V_{Si}^{0}$ to $V_{Si}^-$, but also
may lead to diffusion of $V_{Si}^-$ away from the probe area, resulting in an
irreversible reduction of the optical signal. Observations of the PCC spectra
allow insights into defect modifications and interactions within a controlled,
designated volume and indicate pathways to improve defect-cavity interactions.

problem-specific constraints and dependency within the labeling space, the
straightforward application of existing deep learning models can lead to
unsatisfactory results. Here, we argue that the following ideas can help
resolve structured prediction problems in bioinformatics. Firstly, we can
combine deep learning with other classic algorithms, such as probabilistic
graphical models, which model the problem structure explicitly. Secondly, we
can design the problem-specific deep learning architectures or methods by
considering the structured labeling space and problem constraints, either
explicitly or implicitly. We demonstrate our ideas with six projects from four
bioinformatics subfields, including sequencing analysis, structure prediction,
function annotation, and network analysis. The structured outputs cover 1D
signals, 2D images, 3D structures, hierarchical labeling, and heterogeneous
networks. With the help of the above ideas, all of our methods can achieve SOTA
performance on the corresponding problems. The success of these projects
motivates us to extend our work towards other more challenging but important
problems, such as health-care problems, which can directly benefit people's
health and wellness.

open question: Under what conditions is the policy iteration method robustly
stable from a dynamical systems perspective? Using advanced stability results
in control theory, it is shown that policy iteration for LQR is inherently
robust to small errors in the learning process and enjoys small-disturbance
input-to-state stability: whenever the error in each iteration is bounded and
small, the solutions of the policy iteration algorithm are also bounded, and,
moreover, enter and stay in a small neighbourhood of the optimal LQR solution.
As an application, a novel off-policy optimistic least-squares policy iteration
for the LQR problem is proposed, when the system dynamics are subjected to
additive stochastic disturbances. The proposed new results in robust
reinforcement learning are validated by a numerical example.

our model, the wave operator of the higher derived theory is a $n$-th order
polynomial expressed in terms of the usual Maxwell operator. Any symmetry of
the primary wave operator gives rise to a collection of independent
higher-order symmetries of the field equations which thus leads to a series of
independent conserved quantities of derived system. In particular, by the
extension of Noether's theorem, the spacetime translation invariance of the
Maxwell primary operator results in the series of conserved second-rank tensors
which includes the standard canonical energy-momentum tensors. Although this
canonical energy is unbounded from below, by introducing a set of parameters,
the other conserved tensors in the series can be bounded which ensure the
stability of the higher derivative dynamics. In addition, with the aid of
auxiliary fields, we successfully obtain the relations between the roots
decomposition of characteristic polynomial of the wave operator and the
conserved energy-momentum tensors within the context of another equivalent
lower-order representation. Under the certain conditions, the 00-component of
the linear combination of these conserved quantities is bounded and by this
reason, the original derived theory is considered stable. Finally, as an
instructive example, we discuss the third-order derived system and analyze
extensively the stabilities in different cases of roots decomposition.

surroundings based on material transport can assist search-and-rescue planning
by reducing the search domain. The spectral clustering method partitions the
domain by identifying fluid particle trajectories that are similar. The
partitioning validity depends on the accuracy of the ocean forecasting, which
is subject to several sources of uncertainty: model initialization, limited
knowledge of the physical processes, boundary conditions, and forcing terms.
Instead of a single model output, multiple realizations are produced spanning a
range of potential outcomes, and trajectory clustering is used to identify
robust features and quantify the uncertainty of the ensemble-averaged results.
First, ensemble statistics are used to investigate the cluster sensitivity to
the spectral clustering method free-parameters and the forecast parameters for
the analytic Bickley jet, a geostrophic flow model. Then, we analyze an
operational coastal ocean ensemble forecast and compare the clustering results
to drifter trajectories south of Martha's Vineyard. This approach accurately
identifies regions of low uncertainty where drifters released within a cluster
remain there throughout the window of analysis. Drifters released in regions of
high uncertainty tend to either enter neighboring clusters or deviate from all
predicted outcomes.

one base reality, ostensibly indicating a high probability that we do not live

such simulations are technically possible remains unproven, then statistical
calculations need to consider not just the number of state spaces, but the
intrinsic model uncertainty. This is achievable through a Bayesian treatment of
the problem, which is presented here. Using Bayesian model averaging, it is
shown that the probability that we are sims is in fact less than 50%, tending
towards that value in the limit of an infinite number of simulations. This
result is broadly indifferent as to whether one conditions upon the fact that
humanity has not yet birthed such simulations, or ignore it. As argued
elsewhere, it is found that if humanity does start producing such simulations,
then this would radically shift the odds and make it very probable that we are
in fact sims.

modeling the recommender system as a user-item bipartite graph to learn

Other factors could, nonetheless, have played a role. This research attempts to

under polymer deformations, and the use of the stretch measure projected from
the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor (or non-affine micro-stretches
derived from that measure) as a basic state variable for the micro-macro
transition. These ingredients are standard, taken from the statistical theory
of polymers, and used in most micromechanical polymer network and soft tissue
models.
  The affinity assumption imposes a constraint in the network which results in
an anisotropic distribution of the orientation of the chains and, hence, in an
additional configurational entropy that should be included. This additional
entropy would result in an additional stress tensor. But an arguably more
natural alternative, in line with the typical assumption for the chain behavior
itself and with the disregard of these forces, is to consider that the network
may fluctuate unconstrained to adapt to macroscopic deformations. This way, the
isotropic statistical distribution of the orientation of the chains is
maintained unconstrained during deformation and no additional stress is
imposed. Then, we show that this free-fluctuating network assumption is
equivalent to consider the stretch projected from the stretch tensor (instead
of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor) as the state variable for the
deformation of the network chains.
  We show very important differences in predictions using both assumed
behaviors, and demonstrate that with the free-fluctuating network assumption,
we can obtain accurate predictions for all tests in polymers using just one
test curve to calibrate the model. With the same macro-micro-macro approach
employing the network affinity assumption, we are capable of capturing
accurately only the test used for calibration of the model, but not the overall
polymer behavior.
