exhibit exotic, and often counter-intuitive, effective behaviour. Such a
behaviour is often achieved through instability-induced transformations of the
underlying periodic microstructure into one or multiple patterning modes. Due
to a strong kinematic coupling of individual repeating microstructural cells,
non-local behaviour and size effects emerge, which cannot easily be captured by
classical homogenization schemes. In addition, the individual patterning modes
can mutually interact in space as well as in time, while at the engineering
scale the entire structure can buckle globally. For efficient numerical
macroscale predictions, a micromorphic computational homogenization scheme has
recently been developed. Although this framework is in principle capable of
accounting for spatial and temporal interactions between individual patterning
modes, its implementation relied on a gradient-based quasi-Newton solution
technique. This solver is suboptimal because (i) it has sub-quadratic
convergence, and (ii) the absence of Hessians does not allow for proper
bifurcation analyses. Given that mechanical metamaterials often rely on
controlled instabilities, these limitations are serious. To address them, a
full Newton method is provided in detail in this paper. The construction of the
macroscopic tangent operator is not straightforward due to specific model
assumptions on the decomposition of the underlying displacement field pertinent
to the micromorphic framework, involving orthogonality constraints. Analytical
expressions for the first and second variation of the total potential energy
are given, and the complete algorithm is listed. The developed methodology is
demonstrated with two examples in which a competition between local and global
buckling exists and where multiple patterning modes emerge.

to the behavioural immune system. While disgust-motivated avoidance occurs in

genetic adaptation, side-lining social transmission and denying parental
modelling. Here, we test whether this strong view is warranted by simulating
100000 years of cultural and biological evolution in various scenarios. We
modelled disgust as a trait that governed the extent to which individuals
forewent potentially contaminated nutrition. This lowered their risk of
gastrointestinal illness, at the cost of increasing starvation risk and
birth-interval. As environmental levels and costs of contamination rose, so did
relative fitness of high-disgust individuals. Evolutionary shifts in disgust as
polygenic trait occurred as a consequence of germ-cell mutations, but were most
prominent in populations with high initial genetic variance. Crucially,
cultural transmission between generations operated at a higher rate, even if
parental modelling was eliminated. This study serves not only as evidence of
cultural evolution shaping the behavioural immune system, but also as an
illustration of emerging theories that paint affective and cognitive mechanisms

($M_h\lesssim10^{9.5}$M$_\odot$) with lower luminosities ($M_{UV} \gtrsim-16$)
and over-densities; (iii) reionization imprints its topology on the ionizing
emissivity of low-mass galaxies ($M_h\lesssim10^{9}$M$_\odot$) through
radiative feedback. Low-mass galaxies experience a stronger suppression of star
formation by radiative feedback and show lower ionizing emissivities in

2D simulations. First, we address the angular distribution of wave-vectors in
the kinetic range between ion and electron scales by studying the variance
anisotropy of the magnetic field components. When taking into account the
single-direction sampling performed by spacecraft in the solar wind, the main
properties of the fluctuations observed in situ are also recovered in our
numerical description. This result confirms that solar wind turbulence in the
sub-ion range is characterized by a quasi-2D gyrotropic distribution of
k-vectors around the mean field. We then consider the magnetic compressibility
associated with the turbulent cascade and its evolution from large-MHD to
sub-ion scales. The ratio of field-aligned to perpendicular fluctuations,
typically low in the MHD inertial range, increases significantly when crossing
ion scales and its value in the sub-ion range is a function of the total plasma
beta only, as expected from theoretical predictions, with higher magnetic
compressibility for higher beta. Moreover, we observe that this increase has a
gradual trend from low to high beta values in the in situ data; this behaviour
is well captured by the numerical simulations. The level of magnetic field
compressibility that is observed in situ and in the simulations is in fairly
good agreement with theoretical predictions, especially at high beta,
suggesting that in the kinetic range explored the turbulence is supported by
low-frequency and highly-oblique fluctuations in pressure balance, like kinetic
Alfv\'en waves or other slowly evolving coherent structures.

investigates how to integrate these human interaction modalities to the

compared to traditional supervised learning algorithms. Finally,
Cycle-of-Learning develops an effective transition between policies learned

to handle advanced manufacturing and high precision tasks. However, further
integration of industrial robots is hampered by their limited flexibility,
adaptability and decision making skills compared to human operators. Assembly
tasks are especially challenging for robots since they are contact-rich and
sensitive to even small uncertainties. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers
a promising framework to learn contact-rich control policies from scratch, its
applicability to high-dimensional continuous state-action spaces remains rather
limited due to high brittleness and sample complexity. To address those issues,
we propose different pruning methods that facilitate convergence and
generalization. In particular, we divide the task into free and contact-rich
sub-tasks, perform the control in Cartesian rather than joint space, and
parameterize the control policy. Those pruning methods are naturally
implemented within the framework of dynamic movement primitives (DMP). To
handle contact-rich tasks, we extend the DMP framework by introducing a
coupling term that acts like the human wrist and provides active compliance
under contact with the environment. We demonstrate that the proposed method can
learn insertion skills that are invariant to space, size, shape, and closely
related scenarios, while handling large uncertainties. Finally we demonstrate
that the learned policy can be easily transferred from simulations to real
world and achieve similar performance on UR5e robot.

wherein all the document vectors are pre-computed, and near-neighbor search
(NNS) is performed with the query vector to find relevant documents. However,
the bottleneck of indexing a large number of dense vectors and performing an
NNS hurts the query time and accuracy of these models. In this paper, we argue
that high-dimensional and ultra-sparse embedding is a significantly superior
alternative to dense low-dimensional embedding for both query efficiency and
accuracy. Extreme sparsity eliminates the need for NNS by replacing them with
simple lookups, while its high dimensionality ensures that the embeddings are
informative even when sparse. However, learning extremely high dimensional
embeddings leads to blow up in the model size. To make the training feasible,
we propose a partitioning algorithm that learns such high dimensional
embeddings across multiple GPUs without any communication. This is facilitated
by our novel asymmetric mixture of Sparse, Orthogonal, Learned and Random
(SOLAR) Embeddings. The label vectors are random, sparse, and near-orthogonal
by design, while the query vectors are learned and sparse. We theoretically
prove that our way of one-sided learning is equivalent to learning both query
and label embeddings. With these unique properties, we can successfully train
500K dimensional SOLAR embeddings for the tasks of searching through 1.6M books
and multi-label classification on the three largest public datasets. We achieve
superior precision and recall compared to the respective state-of-the-art
baselines for each of the tasks with up to 10 times faster speed.

objective does not make a significant distinction between a good and poor
hierarchical clustering in metric spaces. Motivated by this, the paper develops
a new global objective for hierarchical clustering in Euclidean space. The
objective captures the criterion that has motivated the use of divisive
clustering algorithms: that when a split happens, points in the same cluster
should be more similar than points in different clusters. Moreover, this
objective gives reasonable results on ground-truth inputs for hierarchical
clustering. The paper builds a theoretical connection between this objective

inclination from photometry, imply masses of
$M_1=0.869\pm0.006\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and $M_2=0.295\pm0.004\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$
for the white dwarf and the donor. The radius of the donor,
$R_2=0.43\pm0.002\,\mathrm{R}_\odot$, is $\approx 50$ per cent larger than
expected given its mass, while its spectral type is much earlier than the M3.5
type that would be expected from a main sequence star with a similar mass. HST
spectra show strong $\mathrm{N{\small V}}$ 1240 A emission but no
$\mathrm{C{\small IV}}$ 1550 A emission, evidence for CNO-processed material.
The donor is therefore a bloated, over-luminous remnant of a thermal-timescale

Remarkably, the HST ultraviolet data also show a strong 30 per cent
peak-to-peak, $38.9\,$s pulsation that we explain as being due to the spin of
the white dwarf, potentially putting V1460 Her in a similar category to the
propeller system AE Aqr in terms of its spin frequency and evolutionary path.
AE Aqr also features a post-thermal timescale mass donor, and V1460 Her may
therefore be its weak magnetic field analogue since the accretion disc is still

``standing'' within the mathematics community. Highly ranked departments tend
to specialize in some subfields more than in others, and the same subfields are
also over-represented in the most selective mathematics journals or among
recipients of top prizes. Moreover this status of subfields evolves markedly
over the period of observation (1984--2016), with some subfields gaining and
others losing in standing. The status of subfields is related to different
publishing habits, but some of those differences are opposite to those observed
when considering the hierarchy of scientific fields.
  We examine possible explanations for the ``status'' of different subfields.
Some natural explanations -- availability of funding, importance of
applications -- do not appear to function, suggesting that factors internal to
the discipline are at work. We propose a different type of explanation, based
on a notion of ``focus'' of a subfield, that might or might not be specific to
mathematics.

parameters $s=d(d'-1), \ t=d'(d-1), \ \alpha=(d-1)(d'-1)$, $d, d' \ge 2$. In
all known examples, $q=dd'$ is a power of 2 and the partial geometry arises
from a maximal arc of degree $d$ or $d'$ in a projective plane of order $q$ via
a known construction due to Thas \cite{Thas73} and Wallis \cite{W}, with a
single known exception of a partial geometry $pg(4,6,3)$ found by Mathon
\cite{Math} that is not associated with a maximal arc in the projective plane
of order 8. A parallel class of lines is a set of pairwise disjoint lines that
covers the point set. Two parallel classes are called orthogonal if they share
exactly one line. An upper bound on the maximum number of pairwise orthogonal
parallel classes in a partial geometry $G$ with parameters
$pg(d(d'-1),d'(d-1),(d-1)(d'-1))$ is proved, and it is shown that a necessary
and sufficient condition for $G$ to arise from a maximal arc of degree $d$ or
$d'$ in a projective plane of order $q=dd'$ is that both $G$ and its dual
geometry contain sets of pairwise orthogonal parallel classes that meet the
upper bound. An alternative construction of Mathon's partial geometry is
presented, and the new necessary condition is used to demonstrate why this
partial geometry is not associated with any maximal arc in the projective plane
of order 8. The partial geometries associated with all known maximal arcs in
projective planes of order 16 are classified up to isomorphism, and their
parallel classes of lines and the 2-rank of their incidence matrices are
computed. Based on these results, some open problems and conjectures are
formulated.

the Hochschild lattice and is congruence uniform and extremal. These properties
allow for the definition of three associated structures: the Galois graph, the

positive semidefinite evaluation on the linear equations defining a classical
quadrilateral. Such a set is closed under a rich class of convex combinations
called matrix convex combination. That is, given elements $X=(X_1, \dots, X_g)

  A natural class of extreme point for free quadrilaterals is free extreme

nontrivial matrix convex combination of elements of the free quadrilateral.
These free extreme points serve as the minimal set which recovers a free

  In this article we show that the set of free extreme points of a free

polynomials. More precisely, given a free quadrilateral $\mathcal{Q}$, we
construct noncommutative polynomials $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4$ such that a tuple $X \in

\in \mathcal{Q}$ and $p_i(X) =0 $ for $i=1,2,3,4$ and $X$ is irreducible. In

rolling horizon mechanisms have achieved extraordinary results in these type of
problems. However, some limitations are present in Rolling Horizon EAs making
it a grand challenge of AI. These limitations include the wasteful mechanism of
creating a population and evolving it over a fraction of a second to propose an
action to be executed by the game agent. Another limitation is to use a scalar
value (fitness value) to direct evolutionary search instead of accounting for a
mechanism that informs us how a particular agent behaves during the rolling
horizon simulation. In this work, we address both of these issues. We introduce
the use of a statistical tree that tackles the latter limitation. Furthermore,
we tackle the former limitation by employing a mechanism that allows us to seed
part of the population using Monte Carlo Tree Search, a method that has
dominated multiple General Video Game AI competitions. We show how the proposed
novel mechanism, called Statistical Tree-based Population Seeding, achieves
better results compared to vanilla Rolling Horizon EAs in a set of 20 games,

assessed through coursework based assessment methods which include either
modules that are fully assessed through coursework or a mixture of coursework
and examinations than assessed by examination alone. There are a large number
of educational data mining studies that preprocess data through conventional
data mining processes including data preparation process, but they are using
transcript data as they stand without looking at examination and coursework
results weighting which could affect prediction accuracy. This paper proposes a
different data preparation process through investigating more than 230000
student records in order to prepare students marks based on the assessment
methods of enrolled modules. The data have been processed through different
stages in order to extract a categorical factor through which students module
marks are refined during the data preparation process. The results of this work
show that students final marks should not be isolated from the nature of the
enrolled modules assessment methods. They must rather be investigated
thoroughly and considered during EDMs data preprocessing phases. More
generally, it is concluded that educational data should not be prepared in the
same way as other data types due to differences as data sources, applications,
and types of errors in them. Therefore, an attribute, coursework assessment
ratio, is proposed to be used in order to take the different modules assessment
methods into account while preparing student transcript data. The effect of CAR
on prediction process using the random forest classification technique has been
investigated. It is shown that considering CAR as an attribute increases the
accuracy of predicting students second year averages based on their first year

broadly. Here, a PAIN-filtered flavonoid database was screened against four
sites of the protease: a free (normal) conformation of the Substrate Binding
Site (NSBS), an induced-fit state of the SBS (ISBS), a Dimerization Site (DS)
and a Cryptic Site (CS). The mean binding energies of the top five ligands from
each site were -9.52, -11.512, -7.042 and -10.348 kcal/mol for the NSBS, the
ISBS, the DS and the CS, respectively. For the DS and CS, these top five
compounds were selected as candidates to bind their respective site. In the
case of SBS, the top 30 ligands with the lowest binding energies from NSBS and
ISBS were contrasted and the ones present in both lists were selected as the
final candidates. The final list was: Dorsilurin E (FL3FQUNP0001), Euchrenone
a11 (FL2FALNP0014), Kurziflavolactone C (FL2FA9NC0016), Licorice glycoside E
(FL2F1AGSN001) and Taxifolin 3'- (6""-phenyl- acetylglucoside) (FL4DACGS0020)

integrated several confirmation methods, including cross-docking assays and

each user in secondary tier can be served simultaneously by multiple SBSs over
a subcarrier via Joint Transmission (JT). In particular, we formulate a joint

leverage on Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM). Simulation results reveal that

  birthday",,,,"cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The capacity of finite state channels (FSCs) has been established as the
limit of a sequence of multi-letter expressions only and, despite tremendous
effort, a corresponding finite-letter characterization remains unknown to date.
This paper analyzes the capacity of FSCs from a fundamental, algorithmic point
of view by studying whether or not the corresponding achievability and converse
bounds on the capacity can be computed algorithmically. For this purpose, the
concept of Turing machines is used which provide the fundamental performance
limits of digital computers. To this end, computable continuous functions are
studied and properties of computable sequences of such functions are
identified. It is shown that the capacity of FSCs is not Banach-Mazur
computable which is the weakest form of computability. This implies that there
is no algorithm (or Turing machine) that can compute the capacity of a given
FSC. As a consequence, it is then shown that either the achievability or
converse must yield a bound that is not Banach-Mazur computable. This also
means that there exist FSCs for which computable lower and upper bounds can
never be tight. To this end, it is further shown that the capacity of FSCs is
not approximable, which is an even stricter requirement than non-computability.
This implies that it is impossible to find a finite-letter entropic
characterization of the capacity of general FSCs. All results hold even for
finite input and output alphabets and finite state set. Finally, connections to
the theory of effective analysis are discussed. Here, results are only allowed
to be proved in a constructive way, while existence results, e.g., proved based
on the axiom of choice, are forbidden.

respect to random sources in real-world structures, yet an accurate sensitivity
analysis requires the solution of many systems of equations at each
optimization step, leading to a high computational cost. To open up the full
potential of RTO under a variety of random sources, this paper presents a
momentum-based accelerated mirror descent stochastic approximation (AC-MDSA)
approach to efficiently solve RTO problems involving various types of load
uncertainties. The proposed framework can perform high-quality design updates
with highly noisy stochastic gradients. We reduce the sample size to two
(minimum for unbiased variance estimation) and show only two samples are
sufficient for evaluating stochastic gradients to obtain robust designs, thus
drastically reducing the computational cost. We derive the AC-MDSA update
formula based on $\ell_1$-norm with entropy function, which is tailored to the
geometry of the feasible domain. To accelerate and stabilize the algorithm, we
integrate a momentum-based acceleration scheme, which also alleviates the step
size sensitivity. Several 2D and 3D examples with various sizes are presented
to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed AC-MDSA
framework to handle RTO involving various types of loading uncertainties.

Blelloch et al. very recently, in which a thread can fork a concurrent child
thread, recursively and asynchronously. The model incurs a cost of $\Theta(\log
n)$ to spawn or synchronize $n$ tasks or threads. The binary-forking model
realistically captures the performance of parallel algorithms implemented using
modern multithreaded programming languages on multicore shared-memory machines.
In contrast, the widely studied theoretical PRAM model does not consider the
cost of spawning and synchronizing threads, and as a result, algorithms
achieving optimal performance bounds in the PRAM model may not be optimal in
the binary-forking model. Often, algorithms need to be redesigned to achieve
optimal performance bounds in the binary-forking model and the non-constant
synchronization cost makes the task challenging.
  Though the binary-forking model allows the use of atomic {\em test-and-set}
(TS) instructions to reduce some synchronization overhead, assuming the
availability of such instructions puts a stronger requirement on the hardware
and may limit the portability of the algorithms using them. In this paper, we
avoid the use of locks and atomic instructions in our algorithms except
possibly inside the join operation which is implemented by the runtime system.
  In this paper, we design efficient parallel algorithms in the binary-forking
model without atomics for three fundamental problems: Strassen's (and
Strassen-like) matrix multiplication (MM), comparison-based sorting, and the
Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). All our results improve over known results for
the corresponding problem in the binary-forking model both with and without
atomics.

arrangement is essential to predict geomagnetic disturbance. Thus, the
classification relies on the assumption that the ICME's internal structure is a
well organized magnetic flux rope. This paper applies machine learning and a
current physical flux rope analytical model to identify and further understand
the internal structures of ICMEs. We trained an image recognition artificial
neural network with analytical flux rope data, generated from the range of many
possible trajectories within a cylindrical (circular and elliptical

rate to calculate statistics regarding their students' final educational
outcomes (graduating or not graduating). As~an alternative to the six-year
graduation rate method, many studies have applied absorbing Markov chains for
estimating graduation rates. In both cases, a frequentist approach is used.
For~the standard six-year graduation rate method, the frequentist approach
corresponds to counting the number of students who finished their program
within six years and dividing by the number of students who entered that year.
In the case of absorbing Markov chains, the frequentist approach is used to
compute the underlying transition matrix, which is then used to estimate the
graduation rate. In this paper, we apply a sensitivity analysis to compare the
performance of the standard six-year graduation rate method with that of
absorbing Markov chains. Through the analysis, we highlight significant
limitations with regards to the estimation accuracy of both approaches when
applied to small sample sizes or cohorts at a university. Additionally, we note
that the Absorbing Markov chain method introduces a significant bias, which
leads to an underestimation of the true graduation rate. To~overcome both these
challenges, we propose and evaluate the use of a regularly updating multi-level
absorbing Markov chain (RUML-AMC) in which the transition matrix is updated
year to year. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed RUML-AMC approach
nearly eliminates estimation bias while reducing the estimation variation by
more than 40%, especially for populations with small sample sizes.

many business settings, data is distributed across multiple edge locations and
cannot be aggregated due to a variety of constraints. Hence, the applicability

addresses this gap by proposing novel unsupervised algorithms called
\emph{SEEC} for learning and applying semantic vector embedding in a variety of

can engage in joint learning, we adapt the recently proposed federated learning
techniques for semantic vector embedding. Where joint learning is not possible,
we propose novel semantic vector translation algorithms to enable semantic

clique number of a graph of edge metric dimension at most $k$ is
$2^{\Theta(k)}$. We also make progress on a problem from (N. Zubrilina, On the
edge dimension of a graph, Discrete Math. 341, 2018, 2083-2088) by finding a
family of new triples $(x, y, n)$ for which there exists a graph of metric
dimension $x$, edge metric dimension $y$, and order $n$. In particular, we show
that for each integer $k > 0$, there exist graphs $G$ with metric dimension
$k$, edge metric dimension $3^k(1-o(1))$, and order $3^k(1+o(1))$.

practical uses. Quantization and structure simplification are promising ways to
adapt DNNs to mobile devices, and adversarial training is the most popular
method to make DNNs robust. In this work, we try to obtain both features by
applying a convergent relaxation quantization algorithm, Binary-Relax (BR), to
a robust adversarial-trained model, ResNets Ensemble via Feynman-Kac Formalism

4-bit, quantization will produce sparse DNNs. However, this sparsity is
unstructured under advarsarial training. To solve the problems that adversarial
training jeopardizes DNNs' accuracy on clean images and the struture of
sparsity, we design a trade-off loss function that helps DNNs preserve their
natural accuracy and improve the channel sparsity. With our trade-off loss
function, we achieve both goals with no reduction of resistance under weak

with quantized EnResNet with trade-off loss function, we provide robust models

required for subsequent analyses. However, most of these sampling algorithms
are designed for univariate data and cater to post-hoc analyses of single

preserves the original variable relationships and enables different
multivariate analyses directly on the sampled data. Our proposed strategy
utilizes principal component analysis to capture the variance of multivariate
data and can be built on top of any existing state-of-the-art sampling
algorithms for single variables. In addition, we also propose variants of
different data partitioning schemes (regular and irregular) to efficiently
model the local multivariate relationships. Using two real-world multivariate

performing efficient post-hoc multivariate analyses.

various researchers to propose a multitude of modified spacetimes that mimic

possible, but that crucially do not contain singularities at their cores. Due
to recent advances in near-horizon astronomy, the ability to observationally
distinguish between a classical black hole and a potential black hole mimicker
is becoming increasingly feasible. Herein, we calculate some physically
observable quantities for a recently proposed regular black hole with an
asymptotically Minkowski core -- the radius of the photon sphere and the
extremal stable timelike circular orbit (ESCO). The manner in which the photon
sphere and ESCO relate to the presence (or absence) of horizons is much more
complex than for the Schwarzschild black hole. We find situations in which
photon spheres can approach arbitrarily close to (near extremal) horizons,
situations in which some photon spheres become stable, and situations in which
the locations of both photon spheres and ESCOs become multi-valued, with both
ISCOs (innermost stable circular orbits) and OSCOs (outermost stable circular
orbits). This provides an extremely rich phenomenology of potential
astrophysical interest.

models are mostly built upon von Neumann-Morgenstern expected utility theory,
the theory of convex risk measures, or Yaari's dual theory of choice, all of

we extend the preference robust approach to a broader class of choice functions

extends the coverage of decision-making problems, it also brings new
computational challenges due to the non-convexity of the optimization

solving a sequence of linear programming problems. Then, we show how to solve

performance can be tested and compared in those environments in a systematic

on-the-mission UAV recharging by a low-power laser source (below 1 kilowatt).
In order to achieve the maximal energy gain from the low-power laser source, we
propose an operational compromise, which consists of the UAV resting over
buildings with cleared line-of-sight to the laser source. Second, to provide a
precise energy consumption/harvesting estimation at the UAV, we investigate the
latter's dynamics in a mission environment. Indeed, we study the UAV's battery
dynamics by leveraging the electrical models for motors and battery.
Subsequently, using these models, the path planning problem in a particular
Internet-of-Things based use-case is revisited from the battery perspective.
The objective is to extend the UAV's operation time using both laser-charging
and accurate battery level estimation. Through a graph theory approach, the
problem is solved optimally, and compared to benchmark trajectory approaches.
Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency of this novel battery perspective
for all path planning approaches. In contrast, we found that the energy
perspective is very conservative and does not exploit optimally the available
energy resources. Nevertheless, we propose a simple adjustment method to
correct the energy perspective, by carefully evaluating the energy as a
function of the UAV motion regimes. Finally, the impact of several parameters,
such as turbulence and distance to charging source, is studied.

Prior research in blockchain security identified financially incentivized

advance such threats to generate greater reward advantage to the attackers
while undermining the other miners and introduce the share withholding attack
(SWH). SWH withholds shares to increase the attacker's reward payout within the
pool, in contrast to the prior threats withholding blocks, and rather builds on
the block-withholding threats in order to exploit the information about the
impending block submission timing, challenging the popularly established
assumption that the block submission time is completely random and unknown to
miners. We analyze SWH's incentive compatibility and the vulnerability scope by
identifying the critical systems and environmental parameters which determine
the attack's impact. Our results show that SWH in conjunction with block
withholding yield unfair reward advantage at the expense of the
protocol-complying victim miners and that a rational miner will selfishly

arbitrarily on the Ricci scalar, $R$, and the trace of the stress-energy

$\mathcal{L}_{m}$. In the modified theories of gravity where field equations
depend on Lagrangian, there is no uniqueness on the Lagrangian definition and
the dynamics of the gravitational and matter fields can be different depending

depend on fundamental constants and few inputs from the standard model. Our
proposal resolves two limitations: first the energy-momentum tensor of the
$f(R,T)$ gravity is not the perfect fluid one; second, the Lagrangian is not

a supersymmetric abelian gauge group and a possible existence of long-range
force mediated by an ultra-light gauge boson $Z^\prime$ are two extreme
examples of models based on extra $U(1)$ symmetries. Large vacuum energy sets
the scale of inflation while the scales of long-range forces induced by anomaly
free extra gauged $U(1)$ symmetries are constrained by neutrino oscillations,
binary pulsar timings and invisible neutrino decay. There exists a difference
of about 40 orders of magnitude between the scales of these two. Also, gauge
couplings associated with the long-range forces are very small compared to the
standard model couplings and the one required for inflation. We propose a
framework based on clockwork mechanism in which these vastly different scales
and associated new physics can coexist without invoking any arbitrarily small
or large parameter in the fundamental theory. A chain of $U(1)$ is introduced
with characteristic nearest-neighbour interactions. A large $D$-term introduced
at one end governs the dynamics of inflation. $Z^\prime$ is localized on the
other end of the chain, and it can be massless or can get naturally suppressed
mass. The standard model fields can be charged under one of the intermediate
$U(1)$ in the chain to give rise to their small effective coupling $g^\prime$
with $Z^\prime$. Constraints on $g^\prime$ and $M_{Z^\prime}$ are discussed in
the context of the long-range forces of type $L_\mu - L_\tau$, $L_e - L_\mu$

we explore how shape bias can be incorporated into CNNs to improve their
robustness. Two algorithms are proposed, based on the observation that edges
are invariant to moderate imperceptible perturbations. In the first one, a
classifier is adversarially trained on images with the edge map as an
additional channel. At inference time, the edge map is recomputed and
concatenated to the image. In the second algorithm, a conditional GAN is
trained to translate the edge maps, from clean and/or perturbed images, into
clean images. Inference is done over the generated image corresponding to the
input's edge map. Extensive experiments over 10 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithms against FGSM and $\ell_\infty$ PGD-40

adversarial training methods, and b) CNNs trained on edge-augmented inputs are
more robust against natural image corruptions such as motion blur, impulse

capability to measure MIR absorption spectra at a rate of above 10 kHz. PC-FTIR
demonstrates the high scan rate with a high SNR for various spectral bandwidths
by arbitrarily adjusting the instrumental spectral resolution. As a proof of
principle demonstration, we measure high-speed mixing dynamics of two liquids
at a rate of 24 kHz. We also measure MIR spectra of gas-phase molecules with
higher spectral resolution at a rate of 12 kHz. This high-speed MIR
spectrometer could be especially useful for measuring non-repetitive fast

effective recommender system. The sequential recommender system can learn
powerful hidden representations of users from successive user-item interactions
and dynamic users' preferences. To analyze such sequential data, conventional
methods mainly include Markov Chains (MCs) and Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs). Recently, the use of self-attention mechanisms and bi-directional
architectures have gained much attention. However, there still exists a major
limitation in previous works that they only model the user's main purposes in
the behavioral sequences separately and locally, and they lack the global
representation of the user's whole sequential behavior. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel bidirectional sequential recommendation
algorithm that integrates the user's local purposes with the global preference
by additive supervision of the matching task. We combine the mask task with the
matching task in the training process of the bidirectional encoder. A new
sample production method is also introduced to alleviate the effect of mask
noise. Our proposed model can not only learn bidirectional semantics from
users' behavioral sequences but also explicitly produces user representations
to capture user's global preference. Extensive empirical studies demonstrate
our approach considerably outperforms various state-of-the-art models.

quantum state at a particular time, conditioned on a measurement record from
both before and after that time. The technique assumes that an observer, Alice,
monitors part of the environment of a quantum system and that the remaining
part of the environment, unobserved by Alice, is measured by a secondary
observer, Bob, who may have a choice in how he monitors it. The effect of Bob's
measurement choice on the effectiveness of Alice's smoothing has been studied
in a number of recent papers. Here we expand upon the Letter which introduced
linear Gaussian quantum (LGQ) state smoothing [Phys. Rev. Lett., 122, 190402
(2019)]. In the current paper we provide a more detailed derivation of the LGQ
smoothing equations and address an open question about Bob's optimal
measurement strategy. Specifically, we develop a simple hypothesis that allows
one to approximate the optimal measurement choice for Bob given Alice's
measurement choice. By 'optimal choice' we mean the choice for Bob that will
maximize the purity improvement of Alice's smoothed state compared to her
filtered state (an estimated state based only on Alice's past measurement
record). The hypothesis, that Bob should choose his measurement so that he
observes the back-action on the system from Alice's measurement, seems contrary
to one's intuition about quantum state smoothing. Nevertheless we show that it
works even beyond a linear Gaussian setting.

We show that, for the star compactness ${\cal C}$ smaller than $1/3$, they are
prone to Laplacian instabilities of the even-parity perturbation associated
with the scalar-field propagation along an angular direction. Even for ${\cal

find that even the other branch with a vanishing background field derivative is
unstable for a positive perfect-fluid pressure, due to nonstandard propagation
of the field perturbation $\delta \phi$ inside the star. Thus, there are no
stable star configurations in derivative coupling theory without a standard
kinetic term, including both relativistic and nonrelativistic compact objects.

streaming data, which emerges unknown classes sequentially. Different from
traditional closed set learning, CIL has two main challenges: 1) Novel class
detection. The initial training data only contains incomplete classes, and
streaming test data will accept unknown classes. Therefore, the model needs to
not only accurately classify known classes, but also effectively detect unknown
classes; 2) Model expansion. After the novel classes are detected, the model
needs to be updated without re-training using entire previous data. However,
traditional CIL methods have not fully considered these two challenges, first,
they are always restricted to single novel class detection each phase and
embedding confusion caused by unknown classes. Besides, they also ignore the
catastrophic forgetting of known categories in model update. To this end, we
propose a Class-Incremental Learning without Forgetting (CILF) framework, which
aims to learn adaptive embedding for processing novel class detection and model
update in a unified framework. In detail, CILF designs to regularize
classification with decoupled prototype based loss, which can improve the
intra-class and inter-class structure significantly, and acquire a compact
embedding representation for novel class detection in result. Then, CILF
employs a learnable curriculum clustering operator to estimate the number of
semantic clusters via fine-tuning the learned network, in which curriculum
operator can adaptively learn the embedding in self-taught form. Therefore,
CILF can detect multiple novel classes and mitigate the embedding confusion
problem. Last, with the labeled streaming test data, CILF can update the
network with robust regularization to mitigate the catastrophic forgetting.
Consequently, CILF is able to iteratively perform novel class detection and
model update.

contextual semantics is on the one hand forgiving with respect to the details
of the operational semantics, and on the other hand implies strong requirements
for the interplay between the processes after translation. Our result is that
CH embraces the synchronous pi-calculus. Our main task is to find and prove
correctness of encodings of pi-calculus channels by CH's concurrency
primitives, which are MVars. They behave like (blocking) 1-place buffers
modelling the shared-memory. The first developed translation uses an extra
private MVar for every communication.We also automatically generate and check
potentially correct translations that reuse the MVars where one MVar contains
the message and two additional MVars for synchronization are used to model the
synchronized communication of a single channel in the pi-calculus.Our automated
experimental results lead to the conjecture that one additional MVar is
insufficient.

process interactions in Information and Communication Technology systems.
Recent years have witnessed increasing efforts in detecting anomalies with
discrete-event sequences. However, it still remains an extremely difficult task
due to several intrinsic challenges including data imbalance issues, the
discrete property of the events, and sequential nature of the data. To address
these challenges, in this paper, we propose OC4Seq, a multi-scale one-class
recurrent neural network for detecting anomalies in discrete event sequences.
Specifically, OC4Seq integrates the anomaly detection objective with recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) to embed the discrete event sequences into latent
spaces, where anomalies can be easily detected. In addition, given that an
anomalous sequence could be caused by either individual events, subsequences of
events, or the whole sequence, we design a multi-scale RNN framework to capture
different levels of sequential patterns simultaneously. Experimental results on
three benchmark datasets show that OC4Seq consistently outperforms various
representative baselines by a large margin. Moreover, through both quantitative
and qualitative analysis, the importance of capturing multi-scale sequential
patterns for event anomaly detection is verified.

we argue that Lewis's functionalism is an improvement on Nagelian reduction.
This paper thereby sets the scene for the other papers, which will apply our
framework to theories of space and time.
  Overall, we come to praise spacetime functionalism, not to bury it. But we
criticize the recent philosophical literature for failing to stress:
  (i) functionalism's being a species of reduction (in particular: reduction of
chrono-geometry to the physics of matter and radiation);
  (ii) functionalism's idea of specifying several concepts simultaneously by
their roles;
  (iii) functionalism's providing bridge laws that are mandatory, not optional:
they are statements of identity (or co-extension) that are conclusions of a
deductive argument; and once we infer them, we have a reduction in a Nagelian
sense.
  On the other hand, some of the older philosophical literature, and the
mathematical physics literature, is faithful to these ideas (i) to (iii). In
various papers, falling under various research programmes, the unique
definability of a chrono-geometric concept (or concepts) in terms of matter and
radiation, and a corresponding bridge law and reduction, is secured by a
precise theorem. Hence our desire to celebrate these results as rigorous
renditions of spacetime functionalism.

facial affect contributed towards the highest-performing multimodal approach

vocal, and verbal features to detect deception in this dataset, but did not use
facial affect. Across all videos, deceptive and truthful speakers exhibited
significant differences in facial valence and facial arousal, contributing

white color similar to smoke, while in reality haze can be distributed
non-uniformly with different patterns and colors. In this paper, we focus on
haze created by sunlight as it is one of the most prevalent type of haze in the

changes due to sun rays and also a spectrum of haze color due to sunlight color
changes during the day. This presents a new challenge to image dehazing

reproduce the SFMS and generally agree with observations, but the slope is
about unity and thus significantly larger than observed values. This is because
observed galaxies at large stellar masses, although still being part of the
SFMS, are already influenced by quenching. This partial suppression of star
formation by AGN feedback leads to lower star formation rates and therefore to
lower observed slopes. We confirm that including the effects of AGN in our
galaxies leads to slopes in agreement with observations. We find the deviation
of a galaxy from the SFMS is correlated with its $z=0$ dark matter halo
concentration and thus with its halo formation time. This means galaxies with a
higher-than-average star formation rate (SFR) form later and vice versa. We
explain this apparent correlation with the SFR by re-interpreting galaxies that
lie above the SFMS (higher-than-average SFR) as lying to the left of the SFMS
(lower-than-average stellar mass) and vice versa. Thus later forming haloes
have a lower-than-average stellar mass, this is simply because they have had
less-than-average time to form stars, and vice versa. It is thus the nature,
i.e. how and when these galaxies form, that sets the path of a galaxy in the
SFR versus stellar mass plane.

Preceding $P_{\rm c}^{\rm AF}$, however, the NQR frequency $\nu_{\rm Q}$
undergoes an abrupt increase at $P_{\rm c}^{\rm *}$ = 0.8 GPa in the

an unusually large fraction of gapless excitations well below $T_{\rm c}$ that

isotopic fractionation through multiple observations. To understand such
effects, we have developed a new gas-grain chemical model with updated 13C
fractionation reactions (also including the corresponding reactions for 15N,
18O and 34S). For chemical ages typical of dense clouds, our nominal model
leads to two 13C reservoirs: CO and the species that derive from CO, mainly
s-CO and s-CH3OH, as well as C3 in the gas phase. The nominal model leads to
strong enrichment in C3, c-C3H2 and C2H in contradiction with observations.
When C3 reacts with oxygen atoms the global agreement between the various
observations and the simulations is rather good showing variable 13C
fractionation levels which are specific to each species. Alternatively,
hydrogen atom reactions lead to notable relative 13C fractionation effects for
the two non-equivalent isotopologues of C2H, c-C3H2 and C2S. As there are
several important fractionation reactions, some carbon bearing species are
enriched in 13C, particularly CO, depleting atomic 13C in the gas phase. This
induces a 13C depletion in CH4 formed on grain surfaces, an effect that is not
observed in the CH4 in the solar system, in particular on Titan. This seems to
indicate a transformation of matter between the collapse of the molecular
clouds, leading to the formation of the protostellar disc, and the formation of
the planets. Or it means that the atomic carbon sticking to the grains reacts
with the species already on the grains giving very little CH4.

de-identified data from a cohort of 66430 COVID-19 positive patients seen at

COVID-19 related mortality from $78.8\%$ ($95\%$ confidence interval [CI]:
$76.0$, $84.7\%$) to $69.4\%$ ($95\%$ CI: $57.6, 75.2\%$) specificity at a

economic deployment at the global level and stakeholder preferences in a case
study of Japan. The model is mathematically formulated as a very large-scale
linear optimization problem, aiming to minimize system costs, including
generation type, fuel costs, conversion costs, and carbon reduction costs,
subject to the constraint of carbon dioxide reductions for each nation. Results
show that between approximately 0.8% and 2% of global energy consumption needs
can be met by hydrogen out to the year 2050, with city gas and transport
emerging as significant use cases. Passenger FCVs and hydrogen buses account
for almost all of the hydrogen-based transportation sector, leading to a global
deployment of approximately 120 million FCVs by 2050. Hydrogen production is
reliant on fossil fuels, and OECD nations are net importers - especially Japan
with a 100% import case. To underpin hydrogen production from fossil fuels,
carbon capture and storage (CCS) is required in significant quantities when
anticipating a large fleet of FCVs. Stakeholder engagement suggests optimism
toward FCV deployment while policy issues identified include necessity for
large-scale future energy system investment and rapid technical and economic

dwarf planets suggests that they may often coexist, as for example around
Haumea. A ring perturbed by an oblate central body and by an inclined satellite
may disperse on a short timescale. The conditions under which a ring may
survive are explored both analytically and numerically. The trajectories of
ring particles are integrated under the influence of the gravitational field of
a triaxial ellipsoid and (a) massive satellite(s), including the effects of
collisions. A ring initially formed in the equatorial plane of the central body
will be disrupted if the satellite has an inclination in the Kozai Lidov regime
(39.2 < i < 144.8). For lower inclinations, the ring may relax to the satellite
orbital plane thanks to an intense collisional damping. On the other hand, a
significant J2 term easily suppresses the perturbations of an inclined
satellite within a critical semimajor axis, even in the case of Kozai Lidov
cycles. However, if the ring is initially inclined with respect to the
equatorial plane, the same J2 perturbations are not a protective factor but
instead disrupt the ring on a short timescale. The ring found around Haumea is
stable despite the rise in the impact velocities that is due to the asymmetric
shape of the the body and the presence of a 3:1 resonance with the rotation of
the central body. A ring close to an oblate central body should be searched for
in the proximity of the equatorial plane, where the J2 perturbations protect it
against the perturbations of an external inclined satellites. In an inclined
configuration, the J2 term is itself disruptive.

been investigated by means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at Cu K edge
and ab-initio calculations, up to 17 GPa. The crystal structure of CuO consists
of Cu motifs within CuO$_4$ square planar units and two elongated apical Cu-O
bonds. The CuO$_4$ square planar units are stable in the studied pressure
range, with Cu-O distances that are approximately constant up to 5 GPa, and
then decrease slightly up to 17 GPa. In contrast, the elongated Cu-O apical
distances decrease continuously with pressure in the studied range. An
anomalous increase of the mean square relative displacement (EXAFS Debye
Waller, \sigma$^2$) of the elongated Cu-O path is observed from 5 GPa up to 13
GPa, when a drastic reduction takes place in \sigma$^2$. This is interpreted in
terms of local dynamic disorder along the apical Cu-O path. At higher pressures
(P>13 GPa), the local structure of Cu$^{2+}$ changes from a 4-fold square
planar to a 4+2 Jahn-Teller distorted octahedral ion. We interpret these
results in terms of the tendency of the Cu$^{2+}$ ion to form favorable
interactions with the apical O atoms. Also, the decrease in Cu-O apical
distance caused by compression softens the normal mode associated with the
out-of-plane Cu movement. CuO is predicted to have an anomalous rise in
permittivity with pressure as well as modest piezoelectricity in the 5-13 GPa
pressure range. In addition, the near edge features in our XAS experiment show
a discontinuity and a change of tendency at 5 GPa. For P < 5 GPa the evolution
of the edge shoulder is ascribed to purely electronic effects which also affect
the charge transfer integral. This is linked to a charge migration from the Cu
to O, but also to an increase of the energy band gap, which show a change of
tendency occurring also at 5 GPa.

numerous trace molecules are effective from ground based telescopes, but the
relationships between the emission of one molecular line and the H2 column
density (NH2) is non-linear and sensitive to excitation conditions, optical
depths, abundance variations due to the underlying physico-chemistry. We aim to
use multi-molecule line emission to infer NH2 from radio observations. We
propose a data-driven approach to determine NH2 from radio molecular line
observations. We use supervised machine learning methods (Random Forests) on
wide-field hyperspectral IRAM-30m observations of the Orion B molecular cloud
to train a predictor of NH2, using a limited set of molecular lines as input,
and the Herschel-based dust-derived NH2 as ground truth output. For conditions
similar to the Orion B molecular cloud, we obtain predictions of NH2 within a
typical factor of 1.2 from the Herschel-based estimates. An analysis of the
contributions of the different lines to the predictions show that the most
important lines are $^{13}$CO(1-0), $^{12}$CO(1-0), C$^{18}$O(1-0), and
HCO$^+$(1-0). A detailed analysis distinguishing between diffuse, translucent,
filamentary, and dense core conditions show that the importance of these four
lines depends on the regime, and that it is recommended to add the
N$_2$H$^+$(1-0) and CH$_3$OH(20-10) lines for the prediction of NH2 in dense

giant elliptical galaxy, Centaurus A. We find that a single major merger event
with a mass ratio up to 1.5, and which has happened ~2 Gyr ago, is able to
reproduce many of its properties, including galaxy kinematics, the inner gas
disk, stellar halo ages and metallicities, and numerous faint features observed
in the halo. The elongated halo shape is mostly made of progenitor residuals
deposited by the merger, which also contribute to stellar shells observed in
the Centaurus A halo. The current model also reproduces the measured Planetary
Nebulae line of sight velocity and their velocity dispersion. Models with small
mass ratio and relatively low gas fraction result in a de Vaucouleurs profile
distribution, which is consistent with observations and model expectations. A
recent merger left imprints in the age distribution that are consistent with
the young stellar and Globular Cluster populations (2-4 Gyrs) found within the
halo. We conclude that even if not all properties of Centaurus A have been
accurately reproduced, a recent major merger has likely occurred to form the
Centaurus A galaxy as we observe it at present day.

generated by quasi-2D structures (with wave vectors mostly-perpendicular to the
mean magnetic field) is able to generate a temperature profile close to the one
observed in solar wind ($\simeq 1/R$) in the range 0.2 $\le R \le$ 1 au.
Theory, observations and numerical simulations point to another robust
structure, the radial-slab, with dominant wave vectors along the radial: we
study here the efficiency of the radial-slab cascade in building the $1/R$
temperature profile. As in MGV18, we solve the three-dimensional MHD equations
including expansion to simulate the turbulent evolution. We find that an
isotropic distribution of wave vectors with large cross helicity at 0.2 au,
along with a large wind expansion rate, lead again to a temperature decay rate
close to $1/R$ but with a radial-slab anisotropy at 1 au. Surprisingly, the
turbulent cascade concentrates in the plane transverse to the radial direction,
displaying 1D spectra with scalings close to $k^{-5/3}$ in this plane. This
supports both the idea of turbulent heating of the solar wind, and the
existence of two different turbulent cascades, quasi-2D and radial slab, at the
origin of the heating.
  We conclude that sampling the radial spectrum in the solar wind may give but
a poor information on the real cascade regime and rate when the radial slab is
a non-negligible part of turbulence.

alternative steady states with contrasting properties. Such a sudden transition
demonstrates a network's resilience, which is the ability of a system to
persist in the face of perturbations. Most of the research on network
resilience has focused on the transition from one equilibrium state to an
alternative equilibrium state. Although the presence of non-equilibrium
dynamics in some nodes may advance or delay sudden transitions in networks and
give early warning signals of an impending collapse, it has not been studied
much in the context of network resilience. Here we bridge this gap by studying
a neuronal network model with diverse topologies, in which non-equilibrium
dynamics may appear in the network even before the transition to a resting
state from an active state in response to environmental stress deteriorating
their external conditions. We find that the percentage of uncoupled nodes
exhibiting non-equilibrium dynamics plays a vital role in determining the
network's transition type. We show that a higher proportion of nodes with
non-equilibrium dynamics can delay the tipping and increase networks'
resilience against environmental stress, irrespective of their topology.
Further, predictability of an upcoming transition weakens, as the network
topology moves from regular to disordered.

considering rank constraint, the achieved graph will have exactly $c$ connected

principled way. Theoretically, we show that our model is equivalent to a

charge accumulation by ionic gating enables a substantial upshift in the Fermi
level of the Pd film, which was corroborated by suppression of the resistivity
in the Pd. Electromotive forces arising from the inverse spin Hall effect in Pd
under spin pumping were substantially modulated by the gating, in consequence
of the modulation of the spin Hall conductivity of Pd as in an ultrathin Pt
film. The same experiment using a thin Cu film, for which the band structure is
largely different from Pd and Pt and its SOI is quite small, provides further
results supporting our claim. The results obtained help in developing a

have determined the nucleonic gluon distribution at the $J/\psi$ mass scale.
Moreover, we predict the differential cross section of the electroproduction of

First, we simulate errors in demand prediction through unbiased noise

representations to operate receptive region ranges, rather than current
approaches on input images or output features, thus can enhance the
representation of locality while remaining proper local association. Toward
this end, the local partitions are adaptively pooled by using
significance-balanced activations for uniform stripes. Random shifting
augmentation is further introduced for a higher variance of person appearing
regions within bounding boxes to ease misalignment. By two-branch network
architecture, different scales of discriminative identity representation can be
learned. In this way, our model can provide a more comprehensive and efficient
feature representation without larger model storage costs. Extensive

effectiveness of the proposed approach. Especially, our approach achieves a

NFV-based network, a network function (NF) instance may be placed at any node.
On the one hand this offers great flexibility in allocation of redundant
instances, but on the other hand it makes the allocation a unique and difficult
challenge. One particular concern is that there is inherent correlation among
nodes due to the structure of the network, thus requiring special care in this
allocation. To this aim, our novel approach, called CoShare, is proposed.
Firstly, its design takes into consideration the effect of network structural
dependency, which might result in the unavailability of nodes of a network
after failure of a node. Secondly, to efficiently make use of resources,
CoShare proposes the idea of shared reservation, where multiple flows may be
allowed to share the same reserved backup capacity at an NF instance.
Furthermore, CoShare factors in the heterogeneity in nodes, NF instances and
availability requirements of flows in the design. The results from a number of
experiments conducted using realistic network topologies show that the
integration of structural dependency allows meeting availability requirements
for more flows compared to a baseline approach. Specifically, CoShare is able
to meet diverse availability requirements in a resource-efficient manner,
requiring, e.g., up to 85% in some studied cases, less resource overbuild than
the baseline approach that uses the idea of dedicated reservation commonly
adopted for redundancy allocation in NFV.

input data are given as numerical vectors of equal lengths, euclidean distance,
or a Hilbertian inner product is frequently used in modeling algorithms. In a
more generic view, objects are compared by a (symmetric) similarity or
dissimilarity measure, which may not obey particular mathematical properties.
This renders many machine learning methods invalid, leading to convergence
problems and the loss of guarantees, like generalization bounds. In many cases,
the preferred dissimilarity measure is not metric, like the earth mover
distance, or the similarity measure may not be a simple inner product in a
Hilbert space but in its generalization a Krein space. If the input data are
non-vectorial, like text sequences, proximity-based learning is used or ngram
embedding techniques can be applied. Standard embeddings lead to the desired
fixed-length vector encoding, but are costly and have substantial limitations
in preserving the original data's full information. As an information
preserving alternative, we propose a complex-valued vector embedding of
proximity data. This allows suitable machine learning algorithms to use these
fixed-length, complex-valued vectors for further processing. The complex-valued
data can serve as an input to complex-valued machine learning algorithms. In
particular, we address supervised learning and use extensions of

the existence of other non-dark-matter elements in the whole system (such as

through a reference length. Although the fuel flow was the most significant
factor, the visualization plane and the image source were also found to be
particularly relevant, since certain flame features were only perceivable
depending on the approach. The measurements were compared to different existing
theoretical correlations, yielding an overall adjustment ranging from 3.25 to
3.97cm. The present methodology yields an overall statistical tolerance of 1.27
cm and an expanded uncertainty of 0.599 cm. Furthermore, the thermal imaging
has revealed a consistent difference in the overall luminous observable flame
of 2.54 cm. For this particular burner configuration, correlations were derived
by statistical modelling, which explain the flame height fluctuations with an
average setting of 97.23%.

interactions with the circumstellar disk. In this scenario, convergent
migration may occur and lead to the formation of resonant pairs of planets. We
explore the conditions under which convergent migration and resonance capture
take place, and what dynamical consequences can be expected on the dust
distribution surrounding the resonant pair. We combine hydrodynamic
planet--disk interaction models with dust evolution calculations to investigate
the signatures produced in the dust distribution by a pair of planets in
mean-motion resonances. We find that convergent migration takes place when the
outer planet is the more massive. However, convergent migration also depends on
the local properties of the disk, and divergent migration may result as well.
For similar disk parameters, the capture in low degree resonances (e.g., 2:1 or
3:2) is preferred close to the star where the resonance strength can more
easily overcome the tidal torques exerted by the gaseous disk. Farther away
from the star, convergent migration may result in capture in high degree
resonances. The dust distribution shows potentially observable features
typically when the planets are trapped in a 2:1 resonance. In other cases, with
higher degree resonances (e.g., 5:4 or 6:5) dust features may not be
sufficiently pronounced to be easily observable. The degree of resonance
established by a pair of super-Earths may be indicative of the location in the
disk where capture occurred. There can be significant differences in the dust
distribution around a single super-Earth and a pair of super-Earths in
resonance.

array burner where the fuel is injected by four peripheral nozzles and mixed
with the surrounding air. Simulations are conducted with the Reynolds-Averaged
Navier-Stokes technique, and the turbulence effect is modelled with the
realizable k-e model. In addition, the eddy dissipation model is implemented to
calculate the effect of the turbulent chemical reaction rate. Results show that
the essential mixture mechanism occurs within a flame cone derived from the
fuel jets interaction. However, the mixing process is driven by jets drag
allowing an air/fuel smooth mixture to reach the flammability limits at two
zones: one at a lower location or close to the burner surface and a second
before the flame front development. The entire mixing mechanism culminates with
the development of the flame necking cone. Any air concentration that falls
into the cone radius will be entrained, contributing to the overall flame
structure. Since the cone radius reach is limited only by radial distance of
the jet array and the nozzles distance, the flame heights, consequently, depend
solely on fuel mass flow.

We show that the proposed algorithm, named distributed zeroth-order ADMM
(D-ZOA), has intrinsic privacy-preserving properties. Unlike the existing
privacy-preserving methods based on the ADMM where the primal or the dual
variables are perturbed with noise, the inherent randomness due to the use of a
zeroth-order method endows D-ZOA with intrinsic differential privacy. By
analyzing the perturbation of the primal variable, we show that the privacy
leakage of the proposed D-ZOA algorithm is bounded. In addition, we employ the
moments accountant method to show that the total privacy leakage grows
sublinearly with the number of ADMM iterations. D-ZOA outperforms the existing
differentially private approaches in terms of accuracy while yielding the same
privacy guarantee. We prove that D-ZOA converges to the optimal solution at a
rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/M)$ where $M$ is the number of ADMM iterations. The
convergence analysis also reveals a practically important trade-off between

reactions taking place on heterogeneous catalysts require that the catalyst be
stable over long measurement times. But catalyst are often non-stationary, they
may become activated under reaction conditions or become poisoned through use.
It is therefore desirable to develop methods with high data acquisition rates
for kinetics, so that transient rates can be measured on non-stationary
catalysts. In this work, we present velocity resolved kinetics using high
repetition rate pulsed laser ionization and high-speed ion imaging detection.
The reaction is initiated by molecular beam pulses incident at the surface and
the product formation rate is observed by a sequence of laser pulses at a high
repetition rate. Ion imaging provides the desorbing product flux (reaction
rate) as a function of reaction time for each laser pulse. We demonstrate the
method using a 10 Hz pulsed CO molecular beam pulse train to initiate CO
desorption from Pd(332) - desorbing CO is detected every millisecond by
non-resonant multiphoton ionization using a 1-kHz Ti:Sapphire laser. This
approach overcomes the time-consuming scanning of the delay between CO and
laser pulses needed in past experiments and delivers a data acquisition rate
that is 10-1000 times higher. We also apply this method to CO oxidation on
Pd(332) - we record kinetic traces of CO$_2$ formation while a CO beam titrates
oxygen atoms from an O-saturated surface. This provides the reaction rate as a
function of O-coverage in a single experiment. We exploit this to produce
controlled yet inhomogeneously mixed reactant samples for measurements of
reaction rates under diffusion-controlled conditions.

exposed to environmental loads. The basic idea of the method is to decouple the
environmental description from the structural response. This is done by
establishing an envelope of environmental conditions, such that any structure
tolerating loads on this envelope will have a failure probability smaller than
a prescribed value. Specifically, given an $n$-dimensional random variable
$\mathbf{X}$ and a target probability of failure $p_{e}$, an environmental
contour is the boundary of a set $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$ with the
following property: For any failure set $\mathcal{F} \subset \mathbb{R}^{n}$,
if $\mathcal{F}$ does not intersect the interior of $\mathcal{B}$, then the
probability of failure, $P(\mathbf{X} \in \mathcal{F})$, is bounded above by
$p_{e}$. As is common for many real-world applications, we work under the
assumption that failure sets are convex.
  In this paper, we show that such environmental contours may be regarded as
boundaries of Voronoi cells. This geometric interpretation leads to new
theoretical insights and suggests a simple novel construction algorithm that
guarantees the desired probabilistic properties. The method is illustrated with
examples in two and three dimensions, but the results extend to environmental
contours in arbitrary dimensions. Inspired by the Voronoi-Delaunay duality in
the numerical discrete scenario, we are also able to derive an analytical
representation where the environmental contour is considered as a
differentiable manifold, and a criterion for its existence is established.

analyzing dynamics of quantum spin systems. Since the DTWA includes the
leading-order quantum corrections to a mean-field approximation, it is
naturally expected that the DTWA becomes more accurate when the range of
interactions of the system increases. However, quantitative corroboration of
this expectation is still lacking mainly because it is generally difficult in a
large system to evaluate a timescale on which the DTWA is quantitatively valid.
In order to investigate how the validity timescale depends on the interaction
range, we analyze dynamics of quantum spin models with a step function type
interaction subjected to a sudden quench of a magnetic field by means of both
DTWA and its extension including the second-order correction, which is derived
from the Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon equation. We also develop a
formulation for calculating the second-order R\'enyi entropy within the

computed by the DTWA with that by the extension including the correction, we
find that both in the one- and two-dimensional systems the validity timescale

Fluid Mech. 919 (2021) A17","10.1017/jfm.2021.371",,"physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Turbulence in the flow of fluid through a pipe can be suppressed by buoyancy
forces. As the suppression of turbulence leads to severe heat transfer
deterioration, this is an important and undesirable phenomenon in both heating
and cooling applications. Vertical flow is often considered, as the axial
buoyancy force can help drive the flow. With heating measured by the buoyancy
parameter $C$, our DNS show that shear-driven turbulence may either be
completely laminarised or transitions to a relatively quiescent
convection-driven state. Buoyancy forces cause a flattening of the base flow
profile, which in isothermal pipe flow has recently been linked to complete
suppression of turbulence (K\""{u}hnen et al. Nat. Phys., 2018), and the
flattened laminar base profile has enhanced nonlinear stability (Marensi et al.
JFM, 2019). In agreement with these findings, the nonlinear lower-branch
travelling-wave solution analysed here, which is believed to mediate transition
to turbulence in isothermal pipe flow, is shown to be suppressed by buoyancy. A
linear instability of the laminar base flow is responsible for the appearance
of the relatively quiescent convection driven state for $C\gtrsim 4$ across the
range of Reynolds numbers considered. In the suppression of turbulence,
however, i.e. in the transition from turbulence, we find clearer association
with the analysis of He et al. (JFM, 2016) than with the above dynamical
systems approach, which describes better the transition to turbulence. The
laminarisation criterion He et al. propose, based on an apparent Reynolds
number of the flow as measured by its driving pressure gradient, is found to
capture the critical $C=C_{cr}(Re)$ above which the flow will be laminarised or
switch to the convection-driven type. Our analysis suggests that it is the
weakened rolls, rather than the streaks, which appear to be critical for
laminarisation.

because it is difficult to determine the right combination of transfer learner

with two nested levels in a hierarchical manner. Specifically, the upper-level
optimization routine is designed to search for the right combination of
transfer learner and classifier while the nested lower-level optimization
routine aims to optimize the corresponding hyper-parameter settings.To
evaluateBiLO-CPDP, we conduct experiments on 20 projects to compare it with a

variant and Auto-Sklearn, a state-of-the-art automated machine learning tool.

Cartan connection, as we proposed in previous works. A first theorem allows us
to obtain parallel transport from the Cartan connection into a proper Ehresmann
connection, while a second ensures to link the TEGR-Cartan connection to the
Ehresmann one-form that contains the Levi-Civita connection. This yields a
coupling to matter in agreement with observations and the Equivalence
Principle. As the fundamental fields proceed from the Cartan connection, if one
insists on interpreting TEGR as a gauge theory of translations, such
translation gauge field can be extracted from the consistent theory presented.
However, this would entail a fundamental change in the structures known for
gauge theory and a split between gauge field and connection is imperative. The
willingness to take such a step is left to the reader.

issue here stems from the leakage of n258 band transmissions impacting the
observations of passive sensors (e.g. AMSU-A) operating at 23.8 GHz on weather
satellites used to detect the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, which in
turn affects weather forecasting and predictions. In this paper, we study the
impact of 5G leakage on the accuracy of data assimilation based weather
prediction algorithms by using a first order propagation model to characterize
the effect of the leakage signal on the brightness temperature (atmospheric
radiance) and the induced noise temperature at the receiving antenna of the
passive sensor (radiometer) on the weather observation satellite. We then
characterize the resulting inaccuracies when using the Weather Research and
Forecasting Data Assimilation model (WRFDA) to predict temperature and
rainfall. For example, the impact of 5G leakage of -20dBW to -15dBW on the
well-known Super Tuesday Tornado Outbreak data set, affects the meteorological

both the cosmological constant and the curvature of space set to zero. Although
the Einstein-deSitter model went on to serve as a standard model in 'big bang'

was neither original nor important; we find that, by providing the first
specific analysis of the case of a dynamic cosmology without a cosmological
constant or spatial curvature, the authors delivered a unique, simple model
with a straightforward relation between cosmic expansion and the mean density
of matter that set an important benchmark for both theorists and observers. We
consider some philosophical aspects of the model and provide a brief review of
its use as a prototype 'big bang' model over much of the 20th century.

the context of cloud formation processes. We studied the cold neutral medium
(CNM) by means of $\rm HI$ self-absorption (HISA) toward the giant molecular
filament GMF20.0-17.9 and compared our results with molecular gas traced by
$^{13}\rm CO$ emission. We fitted baselines of HISA features to $\rm HI$
emission spectra using first and second order polynomial functions. The CNM
identified by this method spatially correlates with the morphology of the
molecular gas toward the western region. However, no spatial correlation
between HISA and $^{13}\rm CO$ is evident toward the eastern part of the
filament. The distribution of HISA peak velocities and line widths agrees well
with $^{13}\rm CO$ within the whole filament. The column density probability
density functions (N-PDFs) of HISA (CNM) and $\rm HI$ emission (tracing both
the CNM and the warm neutral medium, WNM) have a log-normal shape for all parts
of the filament, indicative of turbulent motions as the main driver for these
structures. The $\rm H_2$ N-PDFs show a broad log-normal distribution with a
power-law tail suggesting the onset of gravitational contraction. The
saturation of $\rm HI$ column density is observed at
$\sim$25$\rm\,M_{\odot}\,pc^{-2}$. We conjecture that different evolutionary
stages are evident within the filament. In the eastern region, we witness the
onset of molecular cloud formation out of the atomic gas reservoir while the
western part is more evolved, as it reveals pronounced $\rm H_2$ column density

necessary to re-train again the model with old and new data samples.

view-points and adding new walking conditions. In both cases, our results are
close to the classical `training-from-scratch' approach, obtaining a marginal
drop in accuracy ranging from 0.2% to 1.2%, what shows the efficacy of our
approach. In addition, the comparison of iLGaCo with other incremental learning

generalization of the most widely used model in literature to which it will
converge when the number of samples and measurement time-window tend to

as short term average crosstalk (STAXT), keeping the same convergence
properties and it showed to be almost independent to time-window. To validate
this model, a new type of characterization of the IC-XT in the dB domain (based
on a pseudo random walk) has been proposed and the statistical properties of
its step distribution have been evaluated. The performed analysis showed that
this characterization is capable of fitting every type of signal source with an
accuracy above 99.3%. It also proved to be very robust to time-window length,
temperature and other signal properties such as symbol rate and pseudo-random
bit stream (PRBS) length. The obtained results suggest that the model was able
to communicate most of the relevant information using a short observation time,
making it suitable for IC-XT characterization and core-pair source signal
classification. Using machine-learning (ML) techniques for source-signal
classification, we empirically demonstrated that this technique carries more

forecasting systems, especially applications based on convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). These are usually trained on atmospheric data represented as
regular latitude-longitude grids, neglecting the curvature of the Earth. We
assess the benefit of replacing the convolution operations with a spherical
convolution operation, which takes into account the geometry of the underlying
data, specifically near the poles. Additionally, we assess the effect of
including the information that the two hemispheres of the Earth have
``flipped'' properties - for example cyclones circulating in opposite
directions - into the structure of the network. Both approaches are examples of
informed machine learning. The methods are tested on the Weatherbench dataset,
at a high resolution of $\sim1.4^{\circ}$ which is higher than many previous
studies on CNNs for weather forecasting. For most lead times up to day +10 for
500 hPa geopotential and 850 hPa temperature, we find that using spherical
convolution or including hemisphere-specific information individually lead to
improvement in forecast skill. Combining the two methods typically gives the
highest forecast skill. The spherical convolution is implemented flexibly and
scales well to high resolution datasets, but is still significantly more
expensive than a standard convolution operation. Finally, we analyze cases with
high forecast error. These occur mainly in winter, and are relatively
consistent across different training realizations of the networks, pointing to
flow-dependent atmospheric predictability.

structure among data by performing clustering on the learned optimal embedding
across views. Though demonstrating promising performance in various
applications, most of existing methods usually linearly combine a group of
pre-specified first-order Laplacian matrices to construct the optimal Laplacian
matrix, which may result in limited representation capability and insufficient
information exploitation. Also, storing and implementing complex operations on
the $n\times n$ Laplacian matrices incurs intensive storage and computation
complexity. To address these issues, this paper first proposes a multi-view
spectral clustering algorithm that learns a high-order optimal neighborhood
Laplacian matrix, and then extends it to the late fusion version for accurate
and efficient multi-view clustering. Specifically, our proposed algorithm
generates the optimal Laplacian matrix by searching the neighborhood of the
linear combination of both the first-order and high-order base Laplacian
matrices simultaneously. By this way, the representative capacity of the
learned optimal Laplacian matrix is enhanced, which is helpful to better
utilize the hidden high-order connection information among data, leading to
improved clustering performance. We design an efficient algorithm with proved
convergence to solve the resultant optimization problem. Extensive experimental
results on nine datasets demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm against
state-of-the-art methods, which verifies the effectiveness and advantages of
the proposed algorithm.

on the evolution of both masses and spins of massive black holes (MBHs) across

statistically extract the intrinsic relation between radiative efficiency
($\epsilon$) and mass ($M_{\bullet}$) of QSOs from their distribution on the
luminosity-(empirically estimated virial) mass plane. By using mock samples, we
find that strong constraint can be put on the $\epsilon-M_{\bullet}$ relation
at redshift $z\lesssim 0.4$ from uniform QSO samples similar to those in Sloan
Digital Sky Survey, and from QSO samples at $z \sim 0.6$ (or $\lesssim 1.0$) if
the magnitude limit of the survey can be $\sim 1-2$ (or $2-3$) magnitude
deeper. Applying this method to the SDSS DR7 QSOs with $z\lesssim 0.7$, we find
$\epsilon \propto M_{\bullet}^{0\sim 1.1}$ (or $\epsilon \propto
M_{\bullet}^{-1.0\sim 0}$) correlation for QSOs with the masses obtained
according to the H$\beta$ (or Mg II) empirical mass estimator. These
contradictory results may be due to the unknown systematic errors in the two
mass estimators, preventing an accurate constraint on the
$\epsilon-M_{\bullet}$ relation by using current available QSO samples. We find
that both the estimates of MBH mass and Eddington ratio distribution functions
can be affected by the $\epsilon-M_\bullet$ relation, suggesting that the
determination of this relation is important for understanding the accretion and
growth history of MBHs. In future, the intrinsic $\epsilon-M_{\bullet}$
relation is expected to be strongly constrained by using QSO samples obtained
from surveys deeper than SDSS if the host galaxy contamination and systematic
errors of the mass estimator(s) can be well modeled or removed.

interfaces for map exploration require their users to zoom in and out
frequently. Indeed, zooming and panning are tools suitable for choosing the map
extent corresponding to an area of interest. They are not as suitable, however,
for resolving the graphical clutter caused by a high feature density since
zooming in to a large map scale leads to a loss of context. Therefore we
present new external labeling methods that allow navigating through dense sets
of points of interest while keeping the current map extent fixed. We provide a
unified model, in which labels are placed at the boundary of the map and
visually associated with the corresponding features via connecting lines, which
are called leaders. Since the screen space is limited, labeling all features at
the same time is impractical. Therefore, at any time, we label a subset of the
features. We offer interaction techniques to change the current selection of
features systematically and, thus, give the user access to all features. We
distinguish three methods, which allow the user either to slide the labels
along the bottom side of the map or to browse the labels based on pages or
stacks. We present a generic algorithmic framework that provides us with the
possibility of expressing the different variants of interaction techniques as
optimization problems in a unified way. We propose both exact algorithms and
fast and simple heuristics that solve the optimization problems taking into
account different criteria such as the ranking of the labels, the total leader
length and the distance between leaders. We experimentally evaluate these
algorithms and discuss the three variants with respect to their strengths and
weaknesses proving the flexibility of the presented algorithmic framework.

waveguide. The chirality can be tuned by changing either the atom-waveguide
coupling or the external bias of the PCW. Furthermore, the chiral bound states
can induce directional dipole-dipole interactions between multiple giant atoms

channels is fundamentally limited by mode-dependent loss (MDL) and
mode-dependent gain (MDG) generated in components and amplifiers. In these
systems, MDL/MDG must be accurately estimated for performance analysis and
troubleshooting. Most recent demonstrations of SDM with coupled channels
perform MDL/MDG estimation by digital signal processing (DSP) techniques based
on the coefficients of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) adaptive
equalizers.
  Although these methods provide a valid indication of the order of magnitude
of the accumulated MDL/MDG over the link, MIMO equalizers are usually updated
according to the minimum mean square error (MMSE) criterion, which is known to
depend on the channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Therefore, MDL/MDG
estimation techniques based on the adaptive filter coefficients are also
impaired by noise. In this paper, we model analytically the influence of the
SNR on DSP-based MDL/MDG estimation, and show that the technique is prone to
errors. Based on the transfer function of MIMO MMSE equalizers, and assuming a
known SNR, we calculate a correction factor that improves the estimation
process in moderate levels of MDL/MDG and SNR. The correction factor is
validated by simulation of a 6-mode long-haul transmission link, and
experimentally using a 3-mode transmission link. The results confirm the
limitations of the standard estimation method in scenarios of high additive
noise and MDL/MDG, and indicate the correction factor as a possible solution in
practical SDM scenarios.

Particular attention is paid to the steady-state creep rates and
stress-exponents (n) during isostress treatments. Three regimes of stress
dependence are observed. Two of these were previously reported for WC-Co: power
law creep (n~3) at medium stresses; and grain boundary sliding (n~1) at higher
stresses, generally >100MPa. A previously unreported low stress (<10MPa) regime
with an exponent of n~2 is also observed. By combining electron microscopy with
X-ray diffraction texture measurements, the low stress regime is attributed to
viscous flow of the binder, which is accommodated by diffusional creep in the
WC skeleton. The mechanism may be applicable to other hardmetals. Compared to
analogous WC-Co materials, WC-FeCr shows improved creep resistance below 1000
{\deg}C, which can be explained by its lower self-diffusivity, and a lower
solubility for WC than Co. However, at temperatures corresponding to liquid
eutectic formation (~1140 {\deg}C), its creep resistance becomes inferior.
These results indicate FeCr may be a suitable replacement for Co provided the
eutectic temperature is not exceeded.

medical imaging and are considered as key approaches for revolutionizing
diagnostic imaging practices. However, there are still challenges for the
successful integration of deep learning into medical imaging tasks due to a
lack of large annotated imaging data. To address this issue, we propose a
teacher-student learning framework to transfer knowledge from a carefully
pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) teacher to a student CNN. In
this study, we explore the performance of knowledge transfer in the medical
imaging setting. We investigate the proposed network's performance when the
student network is trained on a small dataset (target dataset) as well as when
teacher's and student's domains are distinct. The performances of the CNN
models are evaluated on three medical imaging datasets including Diabetic
Retinopathy, CheXpert, and ChestX-ray8. Our results indicate that the
teacher-student learning framework outperforms transfer learning for small
imaging datasets. Particularly, the teacher-student learning framework improves
the area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of the CNN model on a small sample of
CheXpert (n=5k) by 4% and on ChestX-ray8 (n=5.6k) by 9%. In addition to small
training data size, we also demonstrate a clear advantage of the
teacher-student learning framework in the medical imaging setting compared to
transfer learning. We observe that the teacher-student network holds a great
promise not only to improve the performance of diagnosis but also to reduce
overfitting when the dataset is small.

convergence bears no significant dependence on the underlying topology, whereas
the picture changes completely under the majority rule, where network density
negatively affects convergence. We believe that the model we propose is at the

training deep neural networks, that are often counteracted by pruning and
regularization strategies. However, these strategies remain secondary to most
learning approaches and suffer from time and computational intensive
procedures. We suggest a multiobjective perspective on the training of neural
networks by treating its prediction accuracy and the network complexity as two
individual objective functions in a biobjective optimization problem. As a
showcase example, we use the cross entropy as a measure of the prediction
accuracy while adopting an l1-penalty function to assess the total cost (or
complexity) of the network parameters. The latter is combined with an
intra-training pruning approach that reinforces complexity reduction and
requires only marginal extra computational cost. From the perspective of
multiobjective optimization, this is a truly large-scale optimization problem.
We compare two different optimization paradigms: On the one hand, we adopt a
scalarization-based approach that transforms the biobjective problem into a
series of weighted-sum scalarizations. On the other hand we implement
stochastic multi-gradient descent algorithms that generate a single Pareto
optimal solution without requiring or using preference information. In the
first case, favorable knee solutions are identified by repeated training runs
with adaptively selected scalarization parameters. Preliminary numerical
results on exemplary convolutional neural networks confirm that large
reductions in the complexity of neural networks with neglibile loss of accuracy
are possible.

measured by impulse radio UWB (IR-UWB) through-wall radar system. Three test
subjects were measured in different environments and several defined motion
statuses. Using the presented dataset, we propose a human-motion-status

well-trained network, the recognition accuracy of testing data for three kinds
of motion statuses is higher than 99.7%. The dataset presented in this paper

challenges arising over inference on massive real-world datasets, including

Bayesian methods (such as uncertainty-aware predictions, incorporation of
experts knowledge, and hierarchical modeling), the quality of classic Bayesian
inference depends critically on whether observations conform with the assumed
data generating model, which is impossible to guarantee in practice. In this
work, we propose a variational inference method that, in a principled way, can
simultaneously scale to large datasets, and robustify the inferred posterior
with respect to the existence of outliers in the observed data. Reformulating
Bayes theorem via the $\beta$-divergence, we posit a robustified
pseudo-Bayesian posterior as the target of inference. Moreover, relying on the
recent formulations of Riemannian coresets for scalable Bayesian inference, we
propose a sparse variational approximation of the robustified posterior and an
efficient stochastic black-box algorithm to construct it. Overall our method
allows releasing cleansed data summaries that can be applied broadly in
scenarios including structured data corruption. We illustrate the applicability
of our approach in diverse simulated and real datasets, and various statistical
models, including Gaussian mean inference, logistic and neural linear
regression, demonstrating its superiority to existing Bayesian summarization
methods in the presence of outliers.

over the theory of Quantifier-Free Non-linear Integer Arithmetic, SMT(QF-NIA),
which consists in deciding the satisfiability of ground formulas with integer
polynomial constraints. Following previous work, we propose to solve
SMT(QF-NIA) instances by reducing them to linear arithmetic: non-linear
monomials are linearized by abstracting them with fresh variables and by
performing case splitting on integer variables with finite domain. For
variables that do not have a finite domain, we can artificially introduce one
by imposing a lower and an upper bound, and iteratively enlarge it until a
solution is found (or the procedure times out).
  The key for the success of the approach is to determine, at each iteration,
which domains have to be enlarged. Previously, unsatisfiable cores were used to
identify the domains to be changed, but no clue was obtained as to how large
the new domains should be. Here we explain two novel ways to guide this process
by analyzing solutions to optimization problems: (i) to minimize the number of
violated artificial domain bounds, solved via a Max-SMT solver, and (ii) to
minimize the distance with respect to the artificial domains, solved via an
Optimization Modulo Theories (OMT) solver. Using this SMT-based optimization
technology allows smoothly extending the method to also solve Max-SMT problems
over non-linear integer arithmetic. Finally we leverage the resulting
Max-SMT(QF-NIA) techniques to solve $\exists \forall$ formulas in a fragment of
quantified non-linear arithmetic that appears commonly in verification and
synthesis applications.

the presence of muons is well understood in the context of neutron stars, until
the recent study by Bollig et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 242702 (2017)] the
role of muons in core-collapse supernovae had been neglected--electrons and
neutrinos were the only leptons considered. In their study, Bollig et al.
disentangled the muon and tau neutrinos and antineutrinos and included a
variety of muonic weak reactions, all of which the present paper follows
closely. Only then does it becomes possible to quantify the appearance of muons
shortly before stellar core bounce and how the post-bounce prompt neutrino
emission is modified

$D$. We focus on the relations between two abovementioned physical quantities

extends the application of quantum entanglement and correlations as tools for
depicting QPTs in spin-1 systems.

Shortening the paths of arrows from non-branching numbers to branching numbers
into arrows yields a strictly binary graph, labeled $T_{\ge 0}$ with numbers
$S_{\ge 0}$ comprising the congruence classes $[4,16]_{18}$. Each branching
number has an upward child $U:n \to 2n\cdot2^{p-1}$ and a leftward child $L:n

can be turned into disjoint same-generation cotrees, each containing one
generation of either $U$pward successors of $L$eftward numbers or of $L$eftward

Every branching number except the trivial root number $c=4$ is contained in one

crack model (OPC) to investigate the mobility of road networks and propose a
new proxy for resilience of urban mobility. In contrast to static approaches,
the OPC accounts for the dynamics of rerouting as a response to traffic jams.
Precisely, one simulates a sequence of failures (cracks) at the most vulnerable
segments of the optimal origin-destination paths that are capable to collapse
the system. Our results with synthetic and real road networks reveal that their
levels of disorder, fractions of unidirectional segments and spatial
correlations can drastically affect the vulnerability to traffic congestion. By
applying the OPC to downtown Boston and Manhattan, we found that Boston is
significantly more vulnerable than Manhattan. This is compatible with the fact
that Boston heads the list of American metropolitan areas with the highest
average time waste in traffic. Moreover, our analysis discloses that the origin
of this difference comes from the intrinsic spatial correlations of each road
network. Finally, we argue that, due to their global influence, the most
important cracks identified with OPC can be used to pinpoint potential small
rerouting and structural changes in road networks that are capable to
substantially improve urban mobility.

favors the formation of massive seed BHs in protogalaxies. One possible
scenario is formation of massive stars ~ 1e3-1e4 Msun via runaway stellar
collisions in a dense cluster, leaving behind massive BHs without significant
mass loss. We study the pulsational instability of massive stars with the
zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) mass Mzams/Msun = 300-3000 and metallicity Z/Zsun
= 0-0.1, and discuss whether or not pulsation-driven mass loss prevents massive
BH formation. In the MS phase, the pulsational instability excited by the
epsilon-mechanism grows in ~ 1e3 yrs. As the stellar mass and metallicity
increase, the mass-loss rate increases to < 1e-3 Msun/yr. In the red
super-giant (RSG) phase, the instability is excited by the kappa-mechanism
operating in the hydrogen ionization zone and grows more rapidly in ~ 10 yrs.
The RSG mass-loss rate is almost independent of metallicity and distributes in
the range of ~ 1e-3-1e-2 Msun/yr. Conducting the stellar structure calculations
including feedback due to pulsation-driven winds, we find that the stellar
models of Mzams/Msun = 300-3000 can leave behind remnant BHs more massive than
~ 200-1200 Msun. We conclude that massive merger products can seed monster
SMBHs observed at z > 6.

decide if the span of a given $l$-tuple $\V=(\V_1, \ldots, \V_l)$ of $N \times
N$ complex matrices contains a non-singular matrix.
  In this paper, we provide a quiver invariant theoretic approach to this
problem. Viewing $\V$ as a representation of the $l$-Kronecker quiver $\K_l$,
Edmonds' problem can be rephrased as asking to decide if there exists a
semi-invariant on the representation space $(\CC^{N\times N})^l$ of weight
$(1,-1)$ that does not vanish at $\V$. In other words, Edmonds' problem is
asking to decide if the weight $(1,-1)$ belongs to the orbit semigroup of $\V$.
  Let $Q$ be an arbitrary acyclic quiver and $\V$ a representation of $Q$. We
study the membership problem for the orbit semi-group of $\V$ by focusing on
the so-called $\V$-saturated weights. We first show that for any given
$\V$-saturated weight $\sigma$, checking if $\sigma$ belongs to the orbit
semigroup of $\V$ can be done in deterministic polynomial time.
  Next, let $(Q, \R)$ be an acyclic bound quiver with bound quiver algebra
$A=KQ/\langle \R \rangle$ and assume that $\V$ satisfies the relations in $\R$.
We show that if $A/\Ann_A(\V)$ is a tame algebra then any weight $\sigma$ in
the weight semigroup of $\V$ is $\V$-saturated.
  Our results provide a systematic way of producing families of tuples of
matrices for which Edmonds' problem can be solved effectively.

The orthorhombic distortion present in the parent compound CaBaCo$_4$O$_7$

CaBaCo$_3$ZnO$_7$ and CaBaCo$_{4-x}$Fe$_x$O$_7$ with $x \leq 1.5$ are
metrically hexagonal but much better refinements in the neutron diffraction
patterns are obtained using an orthorhombic unit cell. The two types of
substitution have opposite effects on the structural and magnetic properties.
Fe atoms preferentially occupy the sites at the triangular layer. Thus, the
replacement of Co by Fe supresses the ferrimagnetic ordering and
CaBaCo$_{4-x}$Fe$_x$O$_7$ samples are antiferromagnetically ordered with a new
propagation vector k=(1/3,0,0). However, the Zn atoms prefer occupying the
Kagome layer, which is very detrimental for the long range magnetic
interactions giving rise to a magnetic glass. The oxidation state of iron and
zinc is found to be 3+ and 2+, respectively, independently of the content.
Therefore, the average Co oxidation state changes accordingly with the
Fe$^{3+}$ or Zn$^{2+}$ doping. Also, x-ray absorption spectroscopy data
confirms the different preferential occupation for both Fe and Zn cations. The
combined information obtained by neutron diffraction and x-ray absorption
spectroscopy indicates that cobalt atoms can be either in a fluctuating
Co$^{2+}$/Co$^{3+}$ valence state or, alternatively, Co$^{2+}$ and Co$^{3+}$
ions being randomly distributed in the lattice. These results explain the
occurrence of local disorder in the CoO$_4$ tetrahedra obtained by EXAFS. An
anomaly in the lattice parameters and an increase in the local disorder is
observed only at the ferrimagnetic transition for CaBaCo$_4$O$_7$ revealing the
occurrence of local magneto-elastic coupling.

models with noisily measured confounders. The key feature is that a large set
of noisy measurements are linked with the underlying latent confounders through
an unknown, possibly nonlinear factor structure. The main building block is a
local principal subspace approximation procedure that combines $K$-nearest
neighbors matching and principal component analysis. Estimators of many causal
parameters, including average treatment effects and counterfactual
distributions, are constructed based on doubly-robust score functions.
Large-sample properties of these estimators are established, which only require
relatively mild conditions on the principal subspace approximation. The results
are illustrated with an empirical application studying the effect of political
connections on stock returns of financial firms, and a Monte Carlo experiment.
The main technical and methodological results regarding the general local
principal subspace approximation method may be of independent interest.

high hardness and enhanced fracture toughness; a material combination often
being mutually exclusive. While the hardness enhancement obtained whentwo
materials form a superlattice is well described by existing models based on
dislocation mobility, the underlying mechanisms behind the increase in fracture
toughness are yet to be unraveled. Here we provide a model based on linear
elasticity theory to predict the fracture toughness enhancement in
(semi-)epitaxial nanolayers due to coherency stresses and formation of misfit
dislocations. We exemplarily study a superlattice structure composed of two
cubic transition metal nitrides (TiN, CrN) on a MgO (100) single-crystal
substrate. Minimization of the overall strain energy, each time a new layer is
added on the nanolayered stack, allows estimating the density of misfit
dislocations formed at the interfaces. The evolving coherency stresses, which
are partly relaxed by the misfit dislocations, are then used to calculate the
apparent fracture toughness of respective SL architectures by applying the
weight function method. The results show that the critical stress intensity
increases steeply with increasing bilayer period for very thin (essentially
dislocation-free) SLs, before the K_IC values decline more gently along with
the formation of misfit dislocations. The characteristic K_IC vs.
bilayer-period-dependence nicely matches experimental trends. Importantly, all
critical stress intensity values of the superlattice films clearly exceed the
intrinsic fracture toughness of the constituting layer materials, evincing the
importance of coherency stresses for increasing the crack growth resistance.

for all paths of fragment formation and destruction, but instead keeping the
spatial grid resolution high enough to properly resolve the physical length
scales of the problem. We use a 3D grid in spherical coordinates with a
logarithmic scaling in the radial direction and cosine scaling in the polar
direction. Because of that, roughly 25% of the total number of grid cells,
corresponding to $\sim$ 26 million grid cells, are used to model the disk
physics. They constitute the highest resolution simulations performed up to now
on disk fragmentation around a forming massive star with the physics considered
here. We study the convergence of our results by performing the same simulation
for 5 different resolutions. We start from the collapse of a molecular cloud; a
massive (proto)star is formed in its center, surrounded by a fragmenting
Keplerian-like accretion disk with spiral arms. The fragments have masses of
$\sim 1 M_\odot$, and their continuous interactions with the disk, spiral arms
and other fragments results in eccentric orbits. Fragments form hydrostatic
cores, surrounded by secondary disks with spiral arms that also produce new
fragments. We identified several mechanisms of fragment formation, interaction
and destruction. Central temperatures of the fragments can reach the hydrogen
dissociation limit, form second Larson cores and evolve into companion stars.
Based on this, we study the multiplicity predicted by the simulations and find
$\sim 6$ companions at different distances from the primary: from possible
spectroscopic multiples, to companions at distances between 1000 and 2000 au.

be classified as extreme is not straight forward. To assess the extremes of the
traffic flow curves in a coherent way, we use a directional definition of
extremeness and apply the dimension reduction technique called principal
component analysis (PCA) in an asymmetric norm. In the classical PCA one
reduces the dimensions of the data by projecting it in the direction of the
largest variation of the projection around its mean. In the PCA in an
asymmetric norm one chooses the projection directions, such that the
asymmetrically weighted variation around a tail index -- an expectile -- of the
data is the largest possible. Expectiles are tail measures that generalize the
mean in a similar manner as quantiles generalize the median. Focusing on the
asymmetrically weighted variation around an expectile of the data, we find the
appropriate projection directions and the low dimensional representation of the
traffic flow profiles that uncover different patterns in their extremes. Using
the traffic flow data from the roundabout on Ernst-Reuter-Platz in the city
center of Berlin, Germany, we estimate, visualize and interpret the resulting
principal expectile components. The corresponding directional extremes of the
traffic flow profiles are simple to identify and to connect to their location-

principal expectile component which is useful for extracting and analyzing
traffic patterns. Our approach to dimensionality reduction towards the
directional extremes of traffic flow extends the related methodological basis
and gives promising results for subsequent analysis, prediction and control of
traffic flow patterns.

superpolynomials. The theory significantly differs from the supersymmetric Jack
polynomials introduced and studied in several papers by Desrosiers, Mathieu and
Lapointe (Nucl. Phys. B606, 2001). The vector-valued Jack polynomials arise in
standard modules of the rational Cherednik algebra and were originated by
Griffeth (T.A.M.S. 362, 2010) for the family G(n,p,N) of complex reflection
groups. In the present situation there is an orthogonal basis of anti-commuting
polynomials which corresponds to hook tableaux arising in Young's
representations of the symmetric group. The basis is then used to construct
nonsymmetric Jack polynomials by specializing the machinery set up in a paper
by Luque and the author (SIGMA 7,2011). There is an inner product for which
these polynomials form an orthogonal basis, and the squared norms are
explicitly found. Supersymmetric polynomials are obtained as linear
combinations of the nonsymmetric Jack polynomials contained in a submodule;
this is based on an idea of Baker and Forrester (Ann. Comb. 3, 1999). The
Poincar\'e series for supersymmetric polynomials graded by degree is obtained
and is interpreted in terms of certain minimal polynomials. There is a brief
discussion of antisymmetric polynomials and an application to wavefunctions of
the Calogero-Moser quantum model on the circle.

antiferromagnetic orderings, charge density waves and subleading,
superconducting pairing tendencies. For certain parameter regimes we find a
competition of phases, which is also common in crystals, but additionally
encounter phases coexisting in a spatially separated fashion and ordering

resonance production rates of J/Psi, Upsilon(1S), Upsilon(2S), Upsilon(3S) and
makes it extremely difficult to observe resonance production of the Higgs

open up great opportunities in the search for new physics in rare decays of
narrow resonances, the search for new narrow states with small
$\Gamma_{e^+e^-}$, the study of true muonium and tauonium, etc. The existing
monochromatization scheme is only suitable for head-on collisions, while
$e^+e^-$ colliders with crossing angles (the so-called Crab Waist collision
scheme) can provide significantly higher luminosity due to reduced collision
effects. In this paper, we propose a new monochromatization method for
colliders with a large crossing angle. The contribution of the beam energy
spread to the spread of the center-of-mass energy is canceled by introducing an
appropriate energy-angle correlation at the interaction point; $\sigma_W/W \sim
(3-5)10^{-6}$ appears possible. Limitations of the proposed method are also
considered.

learning-based object detectors on drone surveillance footage. The traditional
way of hiding military assets from sight is camouflage, for example by using
camouflage nets. However, large assets like planes or vessels are difficult to
conceal by means of traditional camouflage nets. An alternative type of
camouflage is the direct misleading of automatic object detectors. Recently, it
has been observed that small adversarial changes applied to images of the
object can produce erroneous output by deep learning-based detectors. In
particular, adversarial attacks have been successfully demonstrated to prohibit
person detections in images, requiring a patch with a specific pattern held up
in front of the person, thereby essentially camouflaging the person for the
detector. Research into this type of patch attacks is still limited and several
questions related to the optimal patch configuration remain open.
  This work makes two contributions. First, we apply patch-based adversarial
attacks for the use case of unmanned aerial surveillance, where the patch is
laid on top of large military assets, camouflaging them from automatic
detectors running over the imagery. The patch can prevent automatic detection
of the whole object while only covering a small part of it. Second, we perform
several experiments with different patch configurations, varying their size,
position, number and saliency. Our results show that adversarial patch attacks
form a realistic alternative to traditional camouflage activities, and should
therefore be considered in the automated analysis of aerial surveillance
imagery.

ridges (MORs) is concentrated in narrow regions of elevated melt fraction
called channels. Two feedback mechanisms have been proposed to explain why
these channels grow by linear instability: shear flow of partially molten
mantle and reactive flow of the ascending magma. These two mechanisms have been
studied extensively, in isolation from each other, through theory and
laboratory experiments as well as field and geophysical observations. Here, we
develop a consistent theory that accounts for both proposed mechanisms and
allows us to weigh their relative contributions. We show that interaction of
the two feedback mechanisms is insignificant and that the total linear growth
rate of channels is well-approximated by summing their independent growth
rates. Furthermore, we explain how their competition is governed by the
orientation of channels with respect to gravity and mantle shear. By itself,
analysis of the reaction-infiltration instability predicts the formation of
tube-shaped channels. We show that with the addition of even a small amount of
extension in the horizontal, the combined instability favours tabular channels,
consistent with the observed morphology of dunite bodies in ophiolites. We
apply the new theory to MORs by calculating the accumulated growth and rotation
of channels along streamlines of the solid flow. We show that reactive flow is
the dominant mechanism deep beneath the ridge axis, where the most unstable
orientation of high-porosity channels is sub-vertical. Channels are then
rotated by the solid flow away from the vertical. The contribution of the
shear-driven instability is confined to the margins of the melting region.
Within the limitations of our study, the shear-driven feedback is not
responsible for significant melt focusing or for shallowly dipping seismic
anisotropy [abridged].

accretion during the 2008 ZCMa NW outburst. Over 1000 optical emission lines
reveal accretion, a variable, multi-component wind, and double-peaked lines of
disk origin. The variable, non-axisymmetric, accretion-powered wind has slow
($\sim $0 km s$^{-1}$), intermediate ($\sim -$100 km s$^{-1}$) and fast ($\geq
-$400 km s$^{-1}$) components. The fast components are of stellar origin and
disappear in quiescence, while the slow component is less variable and could be
related to a disk wind. The changes in the optical depth of the lines between
outburst and quiescence are consistent with increased accretion being
responsible for the observed outburst. We derive an accretion rate of 10$^{-4}$
M$_\odot$/yr in outburst. The Fe I and weak Fe II lines arise from an
irradiated, flared disk at $\sim$0.5-3 $\times$M$_*$/16M$_\odot$ au with
asymmetric upper layers, revealing that the energy from the accretion burst is
deposited at scales below 0.5 au. Some line profiles have redshifted
asymmetries, but the system is unlikely sustained by magnetospheric accretion,
especially in outburst. The accretion-related structures extend over several
stellar radii and, like the wind, are likely non-axisymmetric. The stellar mass
may be $\sim$6-8 M$_\odot$, lower than previously thought ($\sim$16 M$_\odot$).
Emission line analysis is found to be a powerful tool to study the innermost
regions and accretion in stars within a very large range of effective
temperatures. The density ranges in the disk and accretion structures are
higher than in late-type stars, but the overall behavior, including the
innermost disk emission and variable wind, is very similar independently of the
spectral type. Our work suggests a common outburst behavior for stars with
spectral types ranging from M-type to intermediate-mass stars.

zeroth (non-oscillatory) and non-zero (oscillatory) harmonics. For the latter
it is possible to eliminate one component of the vector potential resulting in
a fully transverse vector potential orthogonal to the transverse magnetic
field. In addition to the Poisson-like equation for the longitudinal component
of the non-oscillatory problem, a general curl-curl Helmholtz equation results
for the transverse problem covering both, non-oscillatory and oscillatory case.
The derivation is performed in the covariant formalism for curvilinear
coordinates with a tensorial permeability and symmetry restrictions on metric

usual nodal finite element method for the longitudinal problem and by a
two-dimensional edge element method for the transverse problem. The numerical

orders of magnitude longer than achieved by HOFI channels. Hydrodynamic and

such as lead-halides which exhibit long non-radiative lifetimes of carriers

tolerance of materials mostly look at the properties of the host material
and/or the chemical nature of defects that affect the capture coefficients of
defects. However, the recombination activity of a defect is not only a function
of its capture coefficients alone but are also dependent on the electrostatics
and the design of the layer stack of a photovoltaic device. Here we study the
influence of device geometry on defect tolerance by combining calculations of
capture coefficients with device simulations. We derive generic device design
principles which can inhibit recombination inside a photovoltaic device for a
given set of capture coefficients based on the idea of slowing down the slower
of the two processes (electron and hole capture) even further by modifying
electron and hole injection into the absorber layer. We use the material
parameters and typical p-i-n device geometry representing methylammonium lead
halide perovskites solar cells to illustrate the application of our generic
design principles to improve specific devices .

with a dominant metal-rich peak of [Fe/H] ~ +0.3 dex and a metal-poor peak
around [Fe/H]= -0.5 dex, which is 0.2 dex poorer than Baade's Window. The
alpha-elements Mg, Si, Ca, and O show a similar trend to the Galactic Bulge.
The metal-poor component is enhanced in the alpha-elements, suggesting that
this population could be associated with the classical bulge and a fast
formation scenario. We find a clear signature of a rotating nuclear stellar
disk and a significant fraction of high velocity stars with $\rm v_{gal} >
300\,km/s$; the metal-rich stars show a much higher rotation velocity ($\rm

investigated under classical uncertainties in the generators of the dynamics
and nonclassical uncertainties due to decoherence and initial state preparation
errors. A formalism is developed to measure performance based on the
transmission of a dynamic perturbation or initial state preparation error to
the quantum state error. This makes it possible to apply tools from classical
robust control such as structured singular value analysis. A difficulty arising
from the singularity of the closed-loop Bloch equations for the quantum state
is overcome by introducing the #-inversion lemma, a specialized version of the
matrix inversion lemma. Under some conditions, this guarantees continuity of
the structured singular value at s = 0. Additional difficulties occur when
symmetry gives rise to multiple open-loop poles, which under symmetry-breaking
unfold into single eigenvalues. The concepts are applied to systems subject to
pure decoherence and a general dissipative system example of two qubits in a
leaky cavity under laser driving fields and spontaneous emission. A
nonclassical performance index, steady-state entanglement quantified by the
concurrence, a nonlinear function of the system state, is introduced.
Simulations confirm a conflict between entanglement, its log-sensitivity and
stability margin under decoherence.

Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ were measured in the normal state down
to low temperature, reached by applying a magnetic field (up to 66T) large
enough to suppress superconductivity. The electrical resistivity, Hall
coefficient, thermal conductivity, Seebeck coefficient and thermal Hall
conductivity were measured in two overdoped single crystals, with La
concentration $x = 0.2$ ($T_{\rm c}=18$K) and $x = 0.0$ ($T_{\rm c}=10$K). The
samples have dopings $p$ very close to the critical doping $p^{\star}$ where
the pseudogap phase ends. The resistivity displays a linear dependence on
temperature whose slope is consistent with Planckian dissipation. The Hall
number $n_{\rm H}$ decreases with reduced $p$, consistent with a drop in
carrier density from $n = 1+p$ above $p^{\star}$ to $n=p$ below $p^{\star}$.
This drop in $n_{\rm H}$ is concomitant with a sharp drop in the density of
states inferred from prior NMR Knight shift measurements. The thermal
conductivity satisfies the Wiedemann-Franz law, showing that the pseudogap
phase at $T = 0$ is a metal whose fermionic excitations carry heat and charge
as do conventional electrons. The Seebeck coefficient diverges logarithmically
at low temperature, a signature of quantum criticality. The thermal Hall
conductivity becomes negative at low temperature, showing that phonons are
chiral in the pseudogap phase. Given the observation of these same properties
in other, very different cuprates, our study provides strong evidence for the
universality of these five signatures of the pseudogap phase and its critical
point.

significant and anisotropic deformations when adsorbed to a liquid interface.
This, in turn, leads to a complex phase behavior upon compression. Here we
develop a multiscale framework to rationally link the molecular particle
architecture to the resulting interfacial morphology and, ultimately, to the
collective interfacial phase behavior, enabling us to identify the key
single-particle properties underlying two-dimensional continuous,
heterostructural, and isostructural solid-solid transitions. Our approach
resolves existing discrepancies between experiments and simulations and thus
provides a unifying framework to describe phase transitions in interfacial
soft-particle systems. We establish proof-of-principle for our rational
approach by synthesizing three different poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
soft-particle architectures, each of which corresponds to a different targeted
phase behavior. In parallel, we introduce a versatile and highly efficient
coarse-grained simulation method that adequately captures the qualitative key
features of each soft-particle system; the novel ingredient in our simulation
model is the use of auxiliary degrees of freedom to explicitly account for the
swelling and collapse of the particles as a function of surface pressure.
Notably, these combined efforts allow us to establish the first experimental
demonstration of a heterostructural transition to a chain phase in a
single-component system, as well as the first accurate in silico account of the
two-dimensional isostructural transition. Overall, our multiscale framework
provides a bridge between physicochemical soft-particle characteristics at the

luminescent coupling. As a result, luminescent coupling strongly relaxes the

combination with bifacial operation, the optimum perovskite bandgap shifts from

optical based measurements, such an enhancement can be achieved through two
approaches, increasing the number of photons used to interrogate the system and
using quantum states of light to increase the amount of quantum Fisher
information gained per photon. Here we consider the use of quantum states of
light with a large number of photons, namely the bright single-mode and
two-mode squeezed states, that take advantage of both of these approaches for
the problem of transmission estimation. We show that, in the limit of large
squeezing, these states approach the maximum possible quantum Fisher
information per photon for transmission estimation that is achieved with the
Fock state and the vacuum two-mode squeezed state. Since the bright states we
consider can be generated at much higher powers than the quantum states that
achieve the maximum quantum Fisher information per photon, they can achieve an
much higher absolute precision as quantified by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound.
We discuss the effects of losses external to the system on the precision of
transmission estimation and identify simple measurements techniques that can
saturate the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound for the bright squeezed states even in
the presence of such external losses.

achieve smart and reconfigurable wireless communication environment
cost-effectively. Prior works on IRS mainly consider its passive beamforming
design and performance optimization without the inter-IRS signal reflection,
which thus do not unveil the full potential of multi-IRS assisted wireless
networks. In this paper, we study a double-IRS assisted multi-user
communication system with the \emph{cooperative} passive beamforming design
that captures the multiplicative beamforming gain from the inter-IRS channel.
Under the general channel setup with the co-existence of both double- and
single-reflection links, we jointly optimize the (active) receive beamforming
at the base station (BS) and the cooperative (passive) reflect beamforming at
the two distributed IRSs (deployed near the BS and users, respectively) to
maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of all
users. Moreover, for the single-user and multi-user setups, we analytically
show the superior performance of the double-IRS cooperative system over the
conventional single-IRS system in terms of the maximum signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and multi-user effective channel rank, respectively. Simulation results
validate our analytical results and show the practical advantages of the
proposed double-IRS system with cooperative passive beamforming designs.

study the Voronoi model, which takes its inspiration from dense epithelial
monolayers and which displays anomalous, sub-Arrhenius scaling of its dynamical
relaxation time with decreasing temperature. Despite these differences, we find
that the likelihood of rearrangements can vary by several orders of magnitude
within the model tissue and extract a local structural quantity, ""softness""
that accurately predicts the temperature-dependence of the relaxation time. We
use an information-theoretic measure to quantify the extent to which softness
determines impending topological rearrangements; we find that softness captures
nearly all of the information about rearrangements that is obtainable from

non-invasively monitor human cerebral blood flow (CBF). However, the number of
reflected photons that interact with the brain is low when detecting blood flow
in deep tissue. To tackle this photon-starved problem, we present and
demonstrate the idea of interferometric speckle visibility spectroscopy (ISVS).
In ISVS, an interferometric detection scheme is used to boost the weak signal
light. The blood flow dynamics are inferred from the speckle statistics of a
single frame speckle pattern. We experimentally demonstrated the improvement of
measurement fidelity by introducing interferometric detection when the signal
photon number is insufficient. We apply the ISVS system to monitor the human
CBF in situations where the light intensity is $\sim$100-fold less than that in
common diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) implementations. Due to the large
number of pixels ($\sim 2\times 10^5$) used to capture light in the ISVS
system, we are able to collect a similar number of photons within one exposure
time as in normal DCS implementations. Our system operates at a sampling rate
of 100 Hz. At the exposure time of 2 ms, the average signal photon electron
number is $\sim$0.95 count/pixel, yielding a single pixel interferometric
measurement signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of $\sim$0.97. The total $\sim 2\times
10^5$ pixels provide an expected overall SNR of 436. We successfully
demonstrate that the ISVS system is able to monitor the human brain pulsatile
blood flow, as well as the blood flow change when a human subject is doing a
breath holding task.

conditions in elongation simulations using the 3D nerve bundle models. At high
impact speed, mechanical failure occurs at lower strain values in large
unmyelinated bundles than in myelinated bundles or small unmyelinated bundles;
signal propagation continues in large myelinated bundles during and after
loading, although there is a large shift in baseline voltage during loading; a
linear relationship is observed between the generated plastic strain in the

web privacy, image processing and computational biology. In this paper, graph
matching is considered under a stochastic model, where a pair of randomly
generated graphs with pairwise correlated edges are to be matched such that
given the labeling of the vertices in the first graph, the labels in the second
graph are recovered by leveraging the correlation among their edges. The
problem is considered under various settings and graph models. In the first
step, the Correlated Erd\""{o}s-R\'enyi (CER) graph model is studied, where all
edge pairs whose vertices have similar labels are generated based on identical
distributions and independently of other edges. A matching scheme called the
\textit{typicality matching scheme} is introduced. The scheme operates by
investigating the joint typicality of the adjacency matrices of the two graphs.
New results on the typicality of permutations of sequences lead to necessary
and sufficient conditions for successful matching based on the parameters of
the CER model. In the next step, the results are extended to graphs with
community structure generated based on the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). The
SBM model is a generalization of the CER model where each vertex in the graph
is associated with a community label, which affects its edge statistics. The
results are further extended to matching of ensembles of more than two
correlated graphs. Lastly, the problem of seeded graph matching is investigated
where a subset of the labels in the second graph are known prior to matching.
In this scenario, in addition to obtaining necessary and sufficient conditions
for successful matching, a polytime matching algorithm is proposed.

Health Monitoring (SHM) systems are deployed to monitor civil infrastructure.
The continuous monitoring provides valuable information about the structure

environmental conditions, the data measured by the SHM systems tend to be
affected by multiple anomalies caused by faulty or broken sensors. Given a
deluge of high-dimensional data collected continuously over time, research into
using machine learning methods to detect anomalies are a topic of great
interest to the SHM community. This paper contributes to this effort by
proposing the use of a relatively new time series representation named Shapelet
Transform in combination with a Random Forest classifier to autonomously
identify anomalies in SHM data. The shapelet transform is a unique time series
representation that is solely based on the shape of the time series data. In
consideration of the individual characteristics unique to every anomaly, the
application of this transform yields a new shape-based feature representation
that can be combined with any standard machine learning algorithm to detect
anomalous data with no manual intervention. For the present study, the anomaly
detection framework consists of three steps: identifying unique shapes from
anomalous data, using these shapes to transform the SHM data into a local-shape
space and training machine learning algorithm on this transformed data to
identify anomalies. The efficacy of this method is demonstrated by the
identification of anomalies in acceleration data from a SHM system installed on
a long-span bridge in China. The results show that multiple data anomalies in
SHM data can be automatically detected with high accuracy using the proposed
method.

the optimal tracking control problem to achieve the prescribed performance of

is converted as an optimal regulation problem based on an auxiliary system. The
requirements of prescribed performances are transformed into constraint
satisfaction problems that are dealt with by risk sensitive state penalty terms
under an optimization framework. To get approximated solutions of the Hamilton
Jacobi Bellman equation, an off policy adaptive critic learning architecture is
developed by using current data and experience data together. By using
experience data, the proposed weight estimation update law of the critic
learning agent guarantees weight convergence to the actual value. This
technique enjoys practicability comparing with common methods that need to
incorporate external signals to satisfy the persistence of excitation condition
for weight convergence. The proofs of stability and weight convergence of the
closed loop system are provided. Simulation results reveal the validity of the

phenomena. One area that ABM has rarely been applied is coalition formation.
Traditionally, coalition formation is modeled using cooperative game theory. In
this paper, a heuristic algorithm is developed that can be embedded into an ABM
to allow the agents to find coalition. The resultant coalition structures are
comparable to those found by cooperative game theory solution approaches,
specifically, the core. A heuristic approach is required due to the
computational complexity of finding a cooperative game theory solution which
limits its application to about only a score of agents. The ABM paradigm
provides a platform in which simple rules and interactions between agents can
produce a macro-level effect without the large computational requirements. As
such, it can be an effective means for approximating cooperative game solutions
for large numbers of agents. Our heuristic algorithm combines agent-based
modeling and cooperative game theory to help find agent partitions that are
members of a games' core solution. The accuracy of our heuristic algorithm can
be determined by comparing its outcomes to the actual core solutions. This
comparison achieved by developing an experiment that uses a specific example of
a cooperative game called the glove game. The glove game is a type of exchange
economy game. Finding the traditional cooperative game theory solutions is
computationally intensive for large numbers of players because each possible
partition must be compared to each possible coalition to determine the core
set; hence our experiment only considers games of up to nine players. The
results indicate that our heuristic approach achieves a core solution over 90%
of the time for the games considered in our experiment.

applications. The ability to predict, anticipate and reason about future events
is the essence of intelligence and one of the main goals of decision-making
systems such as human-machine interaction, robot navigation and autonomous

there may be multiple future sequences possible for the same input video shot.
A naively designed model averages multiple possible futures into a single
blurry prediction.
  Recently, two distinct approaches have attempted to address this problem as:
(a) use of latent variable models that represent underlying stochasticity and
(b) adversarially trained models that aim to produce sharper images. A latent
variable model often struggles to produce realistic results, while an
adversarially trained model underutilizes latent variables and thus fails to
produce diverse predictions. These methods have revealed complementary
strengths and weaknesses. Combining the two approaches produces predictions
that appear more realistic and better cover the range of plausible futures.
This forms the basis and objective of study in this project work.
  In this paper, we proposed a novel multi-scale architecture combining both
approaches. We validate our proposed model through a series of experiments and
empirical evaluations on Moving MNIST, UCF101, and Penn Action datasets. Our

criterion identifies a maximum in the loading curve beyond which the elastomer
will stretch rapidly and lose stability, and can be seen as a path to failure.
We present numerical calculations for neo-Hookean ideal dielectrics, and obtain
the maximum allowable actuation stretch of a dielectric before failure by
electrical breakdown. We find that applying a fixed pre-stress or a fixed

the elastomer, a scenario which is the opposite of what happens in the case of
a voltage-driven dielectric. Results show that a reversible large actuation of

However, it relies on the assumption that the tissue is initially in a

of tissue is under a significant level of residual stresses that helps to
maintain its ideal mechanical conditions. Here, we propose a modified
multiplicative decomposition model where the initial state (or reference
configuration) of biological tissue is endowed with residual stress instead of
being stress-free. Releasing theoretically the initial residual stress, the
initially stressed state is first transmitted into a virtual stress-free state,
resulting in an initial elastic deformation. The initial virtual stress-free
state subsequently grows to another counterpart with a growth deformation and
the latter is further integrated into its natural configuration with an
excessive elastic deformation that ensures tissue compatibility. With this
decomposition, the total deformation may be expressed as the product of elastic
deformation, growth deformation and initial elastic deformation, while the
corresponding free energy density depends on the initial residual stress and
the total deformation. We address three key issues: explicit expression of the
free energy density,predetermination of the initial elastic deformation, and
initial residual stress. Finally, we consider a tubular organ to demonstrate
the effects of the proposed initial residual stress on stress distribution and
on shape formation through an incremental stability analysis. Our results
suggest that the initial residual stress exerts a major influence on the growth
stress and the morphology of tissues.

(strolling period) of infected cases extending in between waves. We demonstrate
that this constitutes evidence for the existence of near time-scale invariance
that is neatly encoded via complex fixed points in the epidemic Renormalisation
Group approach. As a result we achieve a deeper understanding of multiple wave
dynamics and its inter-wave strolling regime. Our results are tested and
calibrated against the COVID-19 pandemic data. Because of the simplicity of our
approach that is organised around symmetry principles our discovery amounts to
a paradigm shift in the way epidemiological data are mathematically modelled.

linear TV programs. The proposed approach first leverages user viewing patterns
regarding time and TV channels to identify potential candidates for
recommendation and then further leverages user preferences to rank these
candidates given textual information about programs. To evaluate the method, we
conduct empirical studies on a real-world TV dataset, the results of which
demonstrate the superior performance of our model in terms of both
recommendation accuracy and time efficiency.

language for validating RDF data. Specifically, SHACL documents are collections
of constraints that enforce particular shapes on an RDF graph. Previous work on
the topic has provided theoretical and practical results for the validation
problem, but did not consider the standard decision problems of satisfiability
and containment, which are crucial for verifying the feasibility of the
constraints and important for design and optimization purposes. In this paper,
we undertake a thorough study of different features of non-recursive SHACL by
providing a translation to a new first-order language, called SCL, that
precisely captures the semantics of SHACL w.r.t. satisfiability and
containment. We study the interaction of SHACL features in this logic and
provide the detailed map of decidability and complexity results of the
aforementioned decision problems for different SHACL sublanguages. Notably, we
prove that both problems are undecidable for the full language, but we present
decidable combinations of interesting features.

tasks, the application of deep convolutional neural networks to basic research
utilizing natural imaging data has been somewhat limited; particularly in cases
where a set of interpretable features for downstream analysis is needed, a key
requirement for many scientific investigations. We present an algorithm and
training paradigm designed specifically to address this: decontextualized
hierarchical representation learning (DHRL). By combining a generative model
chaining procedure with a ladder network architecture and latent space
regularization for inference, DHRL address the limitations of small datasets
and encourages a disentangled set of hierarchically organized features. In
addition to providing a tractable path for analyzing complex hierarchal
patterns using variation inference, this approach is generative and can be
directly combined with empirical and theoretical approaches. To highlight the
extensibility and usefulness of DHRL, we demonstrate this method in application
to a question from evolutionary biology.

ventilation and difficulty getting rid of bacteria, especially in rush hours
where congestion in mosques leads to air pollution and spread of bacteria, in
addition to unpleasant odors and to a state of discomfort during the pray
times, where in most mosques there are no enough windows to ventilate the
mosque well. This paper aims to solve these problems by building a model of
smart mosques domes using weather features and outside temperatures. Machine
learning algorithms such as k Nearest Neighbors and Decision Tree were applied
to predict the state of the domes open or close. The experiments of this paper
were applied on Prophet mosque in Saudi Arabia, which basically contains twenty
seven manually moving domes. Both machine learning algorithms were tested and
evaluated using different evaluation methods. After comparing the results for
both algorithms, DT algorithm was achieved higher accuracy 98% comparing with
95% accuracy for kNN algorithm. Finally, the results of this study were
promising and will be helpful for all mosques to use our proposed model for
controlling domes automatically.

  Intelligence Self-Improvement",,,,,"cs.AI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recent advances in the development of artificial intelligence, technological
progress acceleration, long-term trends of macroeconomic dynamics increase the
relevance of technological singularity hypothesis. In this paper, we build a
model of finite-time technological singularity assuming that artificial
intelligence will replace humans for artificial intelligence engineers after
some point in time when it is developed enough. This model implies the
following: let A be the level of development of artificial intelligence. Then,
the moment of technological singularity n is defined as the point in time where
artificial intelligence development function approaches infinity. Thus, it
happens in finite time. Although infinite level of development of artificial
intelligence cannot be reached practically, this approximation is useful for
several reasons, firstly because it allows modeling a phase transition or a
change of regime. In the model, intelligence growth function appears to be
hyperbolic function under relatively broad conditions which we list and
compare. Subsequently, we also add a stochastic term (Brownian motion) to the
model and investigate the changes in its behavior. The results can be applied
for the modeling of dynamics of various processes characterized by
multiplicative growth.

electricity prices have discernibly dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Geographical variances in the impact are observed and quantified, and the bulk
