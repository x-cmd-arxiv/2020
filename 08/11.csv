by measurement on system $A$ entangled with $B$, constitute a real disturbance
-- i.e., an objective alteration -- of $B$ in an operational sense? Employing
information theoretic criteria motivated by operational considerations alone,
we argue that the disturbance in question is real for a subset of steerable
correlations. This result highlights the distinction between quantum
no-signaling and relativistic signal-locality. It furthermore suggests a
natural reason why a convex operational theory should be non-signaling: namely,
to ensure the consistency between the properties of reduced systems and those
of single systems.

additional variations in the stellar emission that contaminate the signal
induced by a planet and that need to be corrected. The study of activity
indicators in active stars can improve our capability of modelling this signal.
Our aim is to understand the behaviour of stellar chromospheres of M stars,
studying the more sensitive chromospheric activity indicators, characterising
their variability and on finding the correlations among these indicators to
obtain information on the origin of the magnetic activity in low-mass stars. We
studied the main optical activity indicators (Ca II H&K, Balmer lines, Na I
D$_{1,2}$ doublet, He I D$_3$ and other helium lines) measured for AD Leonis
using the data provided by HARPS-N in 2018 and by HARPS in 2006. We measured
excess flux of the selected activity indicators and analysed the correlation
between the different indicators as well as the temporal evolution of fluxes. A
stellar flare was identified during the 2018 observing run and the H$\alpha$,
H$\beta$, He I 4471 A and He I 5876 A lines were analysed in detail by fitting
the line profiles with two Gaussian components. We found that the Ca II H&K
flux excesses are strongly correlated with each other, but the Ca II H&K
doublet is generally less correlated with the other indicators. Moreover,
H$\alpha$ is correlated with Na I doublet and helium lines. Analysing the time
variability of flux of the studied lines, we found a higher level of activity
of the star during the observations in 2018 than in 2006, while Ca II H&K
showed more intense emission on spectra obtained during the observations in
2006. We investigated the flare evaluating the mass motion during the event.

multitude of speech recognition tasks. Nevertheless, the widespread deployment
of deep neural networks for on-device speech recognition remains a challenge,
particularly in edge scenarios where the memory and computing resources are
highly constrained (e.g., low-power embedded devices) or where the memory and
computing budget dedicated to speech recognition is low (e.g., mobile devices
performing numerous tasks besides speech recognition). In this study, we
introduce the concept of attention condensers for building low-footprint,
highly-efficient deep neural networks for on-device speech recognition on the
edge. An attention condenser is a self-attention mechanism that learns and
produces a condensed embedding characterizing joint local and cross-channel
activation relationships, and performs selective attention accordingly. To
illustrate its efficacy, we introduce TinySpeech, low-precision deep neural
networks comprising largely of attention condensers tailored for on-device
speech recognition using a machine-driven design exploration strategy, with one
tailored specifically with microcontroller operation constraints. Experimental
results on the Google Speech Commands benchmark dataset for limited-vocabulary
speech recognition showed that TinySpeech networks achieved significantly lower
architectural complexity (as much as $507\times$ fewer parameters), lower
computational complexity (as much as $48\times$ fewer multiply-add operations),
and lower storage requirements (as much as $2028\times$ lower weight memory
requirements) when compared to previous work. These results not only
demonstrate the efficacy of attention condensers for building highly efficient
networks for on-device speech recognition, but also illuminate its potential
for accelerating deep learning on the edge and empowering TinyML applications.

which states that any graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be decomposed
into at most $\left\lceil \frac{\Delta}{2}\right\rceil$ linear forests. (A
forest is linear if all of its components are paths.) In 1988, Alon proved the
conjecture holds asymptotically. The current best bound is due to Ferber, Fox
and Jain from 2020 who showed that $\frac{\Delta}{2}+ O(\Delta^{.661})$
suffices for large enough $\Delta$. Here, we show that $G$ admits a
decomposition into at most $\frac{\Delta}{2}+ 3\sqrt{\Delta} \log^4 \Delta$
linear forests provided $\Delta$ is large enough.
  Moreover, our result also holds in the more general list setting, where edges
have (possibly different) sets of permissible linear forests. Thus our bound
also holds for the List Linear Arboricity Conjecture which was only recently
shown to hold asymptotically by Kim and the second author. Indeed, our proof
method ties together the Linear Arboricity Conjecture and the well-known List
Colouring Conjecture; consequently, our error term for the Linear Arboricity
Conjecture matches the best known error-term for the List Colouring Conjecture
due to Molloy and Reed from 2000. This follows as we make two copies of every
colour and then seek a proper edge colouring where we avoid bicoloured cycles
between a colour and its copy; we achieve this via a clever modification of the
nibble method.

passing network model, assuming that the nodes know a linear upper bound on $n$
and that each edge has a unique ID known to both its endpoints (or,
alternatively, assuming the $KT_{1}$ model). The highlight of this algorithm is
its superior communication efficiency: It is guaranteed to send a total of
$\tilde{O} (n)$ messages, each of constant size, till stabilization, while
stabilizing in $\tilde{O} (n)$ rounds, in expectation and with high
probability. After stabilization, the algorithm sends at most one constant size
message per round while communicating only over the ($n - 1$) edges of $T$. In
all these aspects, the communication overhead of the new algorithm is far
smaller than that of the existing (mostly deterministic) self-stabilizing
leader election algorithms.
  The algorithm is relatively simple and relies mostly on known modules that
are common in the fault free leader election literature; these modules are
enhanced in various subtle ways in order to assemble them into a communication
efficient self-stabilizing algorithm.

we propose a light-weight model-agnostic method, namely Informative Dropout
(InfoDrop), to improve interpretability and reduce texture bias. Specifically,
we discriminate texture from shape based on local self-information in an image,
and adopt a Dropout-like algorithm to decorrelate the model output from the
local texture. Through extensive experiments, we observe enhanced robustness
under various scenarios (domain generalization, few-shot classification, image
corruption, and adversarial perturbation). To the best of our knowledge, this
work is one of the earliest attempts to improve different kinds of robustness
in a unified model, shedding new light on the relationship between shape-bias

emission measure (EM) and the coronal temperature ($T$) during the periods when
no prominent stellar flares were observed. We attempted to explain the relation
on the basis of our understanding of the present Sun: a steady corona model
based on the so-called RTV scaling laws and the observed power-law distribution
function of surface magnetic features. We derived a theoretical scaling law of
the EM--$T$ relation for a star with multiple active regions, and applied it to
the observations combined with data in literature. We found that with the solar
parameters, our scaling law seems to be consistent with the data of
slowly-rotating stars. However, more X-ray bright stars are located well above
the scaling law based on the solar parameter. The scaling law may explain the
observations if those stars show a power-law distribution function of active
regions with the same power-law index but a 10-100 times larger coefficient.
This suggests that X-ray bright stars show more active regions for a given size
than the Sun. Since our samples include rapidly-rotating stars, we infer that
the offset of the X-ray bright stars from the present-Sun-based scaling law is
due to the enhancement of the surface magnetic field generation by their rapid
rotation.

the epistemic system; not by the decision system. Based on this remark, I prove
the existence of Newcomb-like problems for which an epistemic system
necessarily expects the entity to make a counterfactually bad decision. I then
address (a slight generalization of) Newcomb's paradox. I solve the specific
case where the player believes that the predictor applies Bayes rule with a
supset of all the data available to the player. I prove that the counterfactual
optimality of the 1-Box strategy depends on the player's prior on the
predictor's additional data. If these additional data are not expected to
reduce sufficiently the predictor's uncertainty on the player's decision, then
the player's epistemic system will counterfactually prefer to 2-Box. But if the
predictor's data is believed to make them quasi-omniscient, then 1-Box will be
counterfactually preferred. Implications of the analysis are then discussed.
More generally, I argue that, to better understand or design an entity, it is
useful to clearly separate the entity's epistemic, decision, but also data
collection, reward and maintenance systems, whether the entity is human,
algorithmic or institutional.

over-testing and over-treatment dramatically increase. Hence, it is important
to understand the influence of testing on treatment selection in general
practice. Most statistical methods focus on average effects of testing on
treatment decisions. However, this may be ill-advised, particularly for patient
subgroups that tend not to benefit from such tests. Furthermore, missing data
are common, representing large and often unaddressed threats to the validity of
statistical methods. Finally, it is desirable to conduct analyses that can be
interpreted causally. We propose to classify patients into four potential
outcomes subgroups, defined by whether or not a patient's treatment selection
is changed by the test result and by the direction of how the test result
changes treatment selection. This subgroup classification naturally captures
the differential influence of medical testing on treatment selections for
different patients, which can suggest targets to improve the utilization of
medical tests. We can then examine patient characteristics associated with
patient potential outcomes subgroup memberships. We used multiple imputation
methods to simultaneously impute the missing potential outcomes as well as
regular missing values. This approach can also provide estimates of many
traditional causal quantities. We find that explicitly incorporating causal
inference assumptions into the multiple imputation process can improve the
precision for some causal estimates of interest. We also find that bias can
occur when the potential outcomes conditional independence assumption is
violated; sensitivity analyses are proposed to assess the impact of this
violation. We applied the proposed methods to examine the influence of 21-gene
assay, the most commonly used genomic test, on chemotherapy selection among

with other Galactic star formation complexes, the Sgr E complex is unusual
because its HII regions all have similar radio luminosities and angular
extents, and they are deficient in ~10micron emission from their
photodissociation regions (PDRs). Our Green Bank Telescope (GBT) radio
recombination line observations increase the known membership of Sgr E to 19
HII regions. There are 43 additional HII region candidates in the direction of
Sgr E, 26 of which are detected for the first time here using MeerKAT 1.28GHz
data. Therefore, the true HII region population of Sgr E may number >60. Using
APEX SEDIGISM 13CO 2-1 data we discover a 3.0x10^5 Solar mass molecular cloud
associated with Sgr E, but find few molecular or far-infrared concentrations at
the locations of the Sgr E HII regions. Comparison with simulations and an
analysis of its radio continuum properties indicate that Sgr E formed upstream
in the far dust lane of the Galactic bar a few Myr ago and will overshoot the

x-ray to create spatially encoded spectra data. For improved sampling, the
spatial-spectral filter is moved continuously with respect to the source. A
model-based material decomposition algorithm is adopted to directly reconstruct
multiple material densities from projection data that is sparse in each
spectral channel. Physical effects associated with the x-ray focal spot size
and motion blur for the moving filter are expected to impact overall
performance. In this work, those physical effects are modeled and a performance
analysis is conducted. Specifically, experiments are presented with simulated
focal spot widths between 0.2 mm and 4.0 mm. Additionally, filter motion blur
is simulated for a linear translation speeds between 50 mm/s and 450 mm/s. The
performance differential between a 0.2 mm and a 1.0 mm focal spot is less than

Moreover, for reasonable filter actuation speeds, higher speeds are shown to
decrease error (due to improved sampling) despite motion-based spectral blur.

  [This version post reviews]",,,,"physics.med-ph physics.app-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Purpose: Phosphorus saturation-transfer experiments can quantify metabolic
fluxes non-invasively. Typically, the forward flux through the creatine-kinase
reaction is investigated by observing the decrease in phosphocreatine (PCr)
after saturation of $\gamma$-ATP. The quantification of total ATP utilisation
is currently under-explored, as it requires simultaneous saturation of
inorganic phosphate (Pi) and PCr. This is challenging, as currently available
saturation pulses reduce the already-low $\gamma$-ATP signal present.
  Methods: Using a hybrid optimal-control and Shinnar-Le-Roux method, a
quasi-adiabatic RF pulse was designed for the dual-saturation of PCr and Pi to
enable determination of total ATP utilisation. The pulses were evaluated in
Bloch equation simulations, compared with a conventional hard-cosine DANTE
saturation sequence, before application to perfused rat hearts at 11.7 Tesla.
  Results: The quasi-adiabatic pulse was insensitive to a $>2.5$-fold variation
in $B_1$, producing equivalent saturation with a 53% reduction in delivered
pulse power and a 33-fold reduction in spillover at the minimum effective
$B_1$. This enabled the complete quantification of the synthesis and
degradation fluxes for ATP in 30-45 minutes in the perfused rat heart. While
the net synthesis flux ($4.24\pm0.8$ mM/s, SEM) was not significantly different
from degradation flux ($6.88\pm2$ mM/s, $p=0.06$) and both measures are
consistent with prior work, nonlinear error analysis highlights uncertainties
in the Pi-to-ATP measurement that may explain a trend suggesting a possible
imbalance.
  Conclusion: This work demonstrates a novel quasi-adiabatic dual-saturation RF
pulse with significantly improved performance that can be used to measure ATP
turnover in the heart in vivo.

  application to Bayesian inversion",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transport maps have become a popular mechanic to express complicated
probability densities using sample propagation through an optimized
push-forward. Beside their broad applicability and well-known success,
transport maps suffer from several drawbacks such as numerical inaccuracies
induced by the optimization process and the fact that sampling schemes have to
be employed when quantities of interest, e.g. moments are to compute. This
paper presents a novel method for the accurate functional approximation of
probability density functions (PDF) that copes with those issues. By
interpreting the pull-back result of a target PDF through an inexact transport
map as a perturbed reference density, a subsequent functional representation in
a more accessible format allows for efficient and more accurate computation of
the desired quantities. We introduce a layer-based approximation of the
perturbed reference density in an appropriate coordinate system to split the
high-dimensional representation problem into a set of independent
approximations for which separately chosen orthonormal basis functions are
available. This effectively motivates the notion of h- and p-refinement (i.e.
``mesh size'' and polynomial degree) for the approximation of high-dimensional
PDFs. To circumvent the curse of dimensionality and enable sampling-free access
to certain quantities of interest, a low-rank reconstruction in the tensor
train format is employed via the Variational Monte Carlo method. An a priori
convergence analysis of the developed approach is derived in terms of Hellinger
distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Applications comprising Bayesian
inverse problems and several degrees of concentrated densities illuminate the
(superior) convergence in comparison to Monte Carlo and Markov-Chain Monte
Carlo methods.

speaker encoding are two typical methods based on base model trained from
multiple speakers. The former uses a small set of target speaker data to
transfer the multi-speaker model to target speaker's voice through direct model
update, while in the latter, only a few seconds of target speaker's audio
directly goes through an extra speaker encoding model along with the
multi-speaker model to synthesize target speaker's voice without model update.
Nevertheless, the two methods need clean target speaker data. However, the
samples provided by user may inevitably contain acoustic noise in real
applications. It's still challenging to generating target voice with noisy
data. In this paper, we study the data efficient voice cloning problem from
noisy samples under the sequence-to-sequence based TTS paradigm. Specifically,
we introduce domain adversarial training (DAT) to speaker adaptation and
speaker encoding, which aims to disentangle noise from speech-noise mixture.
Experiments show that for both speaker adaptation and encoding, the proposed
approaches can consistently synthesize clean speech from noisy speaker samples,
apparently outperforming the method adopting state-of-the-art speech

based CBCT still remains to be a challenge. To address the scatter problem, we
have been investigating the feasibility of a two dimensional antiscatter grid
(2D ASG) concept for FPDs. Although a 2D ASG can potentially provide high
scatter rejection capability, primary transmission characteristics of a 2D ASG
and its implications in image quality plays a more critical role in
implementation of the 2D ASG concept. Thus, in this work, a computational model
was developed to investigate the primary transmission properties of the 2D ASG
for various grid and FPD pixel geometries, and the improvement in signal to
noise ratio,SNR, was calculated analytically to demonstrate the impact of 2D
ASG's transmission characteristics on image quality. Computational model showed
that average primary transmission fraction (Tp) strongly depends on the septal
thickness of 2D ASG, and 2D ASG can provide higher Tp than existing
radiographic ASGs at a septal thickness of 0.1 mm. Due to the higher Tp, 2D ASG
was also predicted to provide SNR improvements in projections in low to
moderate scatter environments typically observed in CBCT imaging. On the other
hand, the model also indicated that the shadow or footprint of the 2D ASG leads
to spatially nonuniform variations in primary signal in FPD pixels. Reduction
of septal thickness and optimization of 2D ASG's pitch may play an essential
role in reducing such variations in primary image signal, and avoiding
potential image artifacts associated with 2D ASG's footprint.

Ryugu. Their oblate shapes with equatorial ridges, or the so-called top shapes,
may have evolved due to their rotational conditions at present and in the past.
Different shape evolution scenarios were previously proposed; Bennu's top shape
may have been driven by surface processing, while Ryugu's may have been
developed due to large deformation. These two scenarios seem to be
inconsistent. Here, we revisit the structural analyses in earlier works and
fill a gap to connect these explanations. We also apply a semi-analytical
technique for computing the cohesive strength distribution in a uniformly
rotating triaxial ellipsoid to characterize the global failure of top-shaped
bodies. Assuming that the structure is uniform, our semi-analytical approach
describes the spatial variations in failed regions at different spin periods;
surface regions are the most sensitive at longer spin periods, while interiors
fail structurally at shorter spin periods. This finding suggests that the shape
evolution of a top shape may vary due to rotation and internal structure, which
can explain the different evolution scenarios of Bennu's and Ryugu's top
shapes. We interpret our results as the indications of top shapes' various
evolution processes.

considering a time-dependent one-body number density. Despite the large number
of recent successes, properly modeling the long-time dynamics in interacting
systems within DDFT remains a notoriously difficult problem, since structural
information, accounting for temporary or permanent particle cages, gets lost.
Here we address such a caging scenario by reducing it to a clean
one-dimensional problem, where the particles are naturally ordered (arranged on
a line) by perfect cages created by their two next neighbors. In particular, we
construct a DDFT approximation based on an equilibrium system with an
asymmetric pair potential, such that the corresponding one-body densities still
carry the footprint of particle order. Applied to a system of confined hard
rods, this order-preserving dynamics (OPD) yields exact results at the system

said to {\em strongly resolve} $u$ and $v$, if there is either a shortest
$u$-$w$ path that contains $v$ or a shortest $v$-$w$ path that contains $u$. A
set $W$ of vertices of $G$ is a {\em strong resolving set} if every pair of
vertices of $G$ is strongly resolved by some vertex of $W$. A smallest strong
resolving set of a graph is called a {\em strong basis} and its cardinality,
denoted $\beta_s(G)$, the {\em strong dimension} of $G$. The {\em threshold
strong dimension} of a graph $G$, denoted $\tau_s(G)$, is the smallest strong
dimension among all graphs having $G$ as spanning subgraph. A graph whose
strong dimension equals its threshold strong dimension is called $\beta_s$-{\em
irreducible}. In this paper we establish a geometric characterization for the
threshold strong dimension of a graph $G$ that is expressed in terms of the
smallest number of paths (each of sufficiently large order) whose strong
product admits a certain type of embedding of $G$. We demonstrate that the
threshold strong dimension of a graph is not equal to the previously studied
threshold dimension of a graph. Graphs with strong dimension $1$ and $2$ are
necessarily $\beta_s$-irreducible. It is well-known that the only graphs with
strong dimension $1$ are the paths. We completely describe graphs with strong
dimension $2$ in terms of the strong resolving graphs introduced by Oellermann
and Peters-Fransen. We obtain sharp upper bounds for the threshold strong
dimension of general graphs and determine exact values for this invariant for
certain subclasses of trees.

  at PHENIX","Thesis submitted to the University of Michigan in partial fulfillment
  of the requirements for the degree of Ph.D",,,,"hep-ex nucl-ex","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Experimental observations of strikingly large transverse single-spin
asymmetries (TSSAs) opened a window into quark and gluon dynamics present in
hadronic collisions, revealing large spin-momentum correlations within nucleons
and in the process of forming hadrons. Though originally measured in lower
energy fixed target experiments, they have been found to persist in collisions
with momentum transfer well into the perturbative regime of quantum
chromodynamics (QCD) and yet their origin remains poorly understood. TSSA
measurements have allowed for the development of both transverse momentum
dependent and collinear twist-3 descriptions of nonperturbative spin-momentum
correlations for both initial- and final-state effects. Results are presented
for the TSSAs of direct photons, neutral pions, and eta mesons in the
pseudorapidity range $|\eta|<0.35$ from $p^\uparrow+p$ collisions with
$\sqrt{s} = 200$ GeV at PHENIX. As hadrons, $\pi^0$ and $\eta$ mesons are
sensitive to both initial- and final-state effects. At midrapidity, $\pi^0$ and
$\eta$ measurements are sensitive to the dynamics of gluons along with a mix of
quark flavors. These results are a factor of three increase in statistical
precision and extend to higher transverse momentum when compared with previous
PHENIX measurements in this kinematic region. Because direct photon production
does not include hadronization, the direct photon TSSA is only sensitive to
spin-momentum correlations in the proton. The kinematics of this result in
particular make the direct photon TSSA a clean probe of gluon dynamics in the
transversely polarized proton. All three of these asymmetries will help
constrain the twist-3 trigluon collinear correlation function as well as the
gluon Sivers function, improving our knowledge of spin-dependent gluon dynamics
in QCD.

lines in J-PAS up to $z = 0.35$. J-PAS will observe $8000$~deg$^2$ of the
northern sky in the upcoming years with 56 photometric bands. The release of
such amount of data brings us the opportunity to employ machine learning
methods in order to overcome the difficulties associated with photometric data.
We used Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) trained and tested with synthetic
J-PAS photometry from CALIFA, MaNGA, and SDSS spectra. We carry out two tasks:
firstly, we cluster galaxies in two groups according to the values of the
equivalent width (EW) of $H\alpha$, $H\beta$, $[NII]{\lambda 6584}$, and $
[OIII]{\lambda 5007}$ lines measured in the spectra. Then, we train an ANN to
assign to each galaxy a group. We are able to classify them with the
uncertainties typical of the photometric redshift measurable in J-PAS.
Secondly, we utilize another ANN to determine the values of those EWs.
Subsequently, we obtain the $[NII]/H\alpha$, $[OIII]/H\beta$, and
\ion{O}{3}\ion{N}{2} ratios recovering the BPT diagram . We study the
performance of the ANN in two training samples: one is only composed of
synthetic J-PAS photo-spectra (J-spectra) from MaNGA and CALIFA (CALMa set) and
the other one is composed of SDSS galaxies. We can reproduce properly the main
sequence of star forming galaxies from the determination of the EWs. With the
CALMa training set we reach a precision of 0.093 and 0.081 dex for the
$[NII]/H\alpha$ and $[OIII]/H\beta$ ratios in the SDSS testing sample.
Nevertheless, we find an underestimation of those ratios at high values in
galaxies hosting an AGN. We also show the importance of the dataset used for
both training and testing the model. ANNs are extremely useful to overcome the
limitations previously expected concerning the detection and measurements of
the emission lines in surveys like J-PAS.

In this set up, we show that in any dimension $d\geq 1$ and for any inverse
temperature, the GMC-volume of a ball, uniformly around all paths, decays
exponentially with an explicit decay rate. The exponential rate reflects the
balance between two competing terms, namely the principal eigenvalue of the
Dirichlet Laplacian and an energy functional defined over a certain
compactification developed earlier in [MV14]. For $d\geq 3$ and high
temperature, the underlying Gaussian field is also shown to attain very high
values under the GMC -- that is, all paths are ""GMC-thick"" in this regime. Both
statements are natural infinite dimensional extensions of similar behavior
captured by $2d$ Liouville quantum gravity and reflect a certain ""atypical
behavior"" of the GMC: while the GMC volume decays exponentially fast uniformly
over all paths, the field itself attains atypically large values on all paths
when sampled according to the GMC. It is also shown that, despite the
exponential decay of volume for any temperature, for small enough temperature,
the normalized overlap of two independent paths tends to follow one of only a
finite number of independent paths for most of its allowed time horizon,
allowing the GMC probability to accumulate most of its mass along such
trajectories.

accurately we can map the colors of galaxies to an underlying spectral
template. Current techniques utilize spectrophotometric samples of galaxies or
spectra derived from spectral synthesis models. Both of these approaches have
their limitations, either the sample sizes are small and often not
representative of the diversity of galaxy colors or the model colors can be
biased (often as a function of wavelength) which introduces systematics in the
derived redshifts. In this paper we learn the underlying spectral energy
distributions from an ensemble of $\sim$100K galaxies with measured redshifts
and colors. We show that we are able to reconstruct emission and absorption
lines at a significantly higher resolution than the broadband filters used to
measure the photometry for a sample of 20 spectral templates. We find that our
training algorithm reduces the fraction of outliers in the derived photometric
redshifts by up to 28%, bias up to 91%, and scatter up to 25%, when compared to
estimates using a standard set of spectral templates. We discuss the current
limitations of this approach and its applicability for recovering the

recovery of parameters from incomplete data. By combining these methods as
presented here, this work demonstrates that potential limitations around the
availability of fine-grained data can be overcome. Thus, finding useful
operational results despite using only administrative data. The paper begins by
finding a useful clustering of the population from this granular data that
feeds into a multi-class M/M/c model, whose parameters are recovered from the
data via parameterisation and the Wasserstein distance. This model is then used
to conduct an informative analysis of the underlying queuing system and the

only effective intervention to reduce the strain caused by those presenting

boundary element method in the time domain, coupled to a finite element method
for the Lam\'{e} equation inside the elastic body. Based on ideas from the
time-independent coupling formulation, we obtain an a priori error estimate and
discuss the implementation of the proposed method. Numerical experiments
illustrate the performance of our scheme for model problems.

Van der Waals interactions out of plane gives rise to interesting properties
for applications such as solid lubrication, optoelectronics, and catalysis,
which can be enhanced by transition-metal doping. However, the mechanisms for
improvement and even the structure of the doped material can be unclear, which
we address with theoretical calculations. Building on our previous work on
Ni-doping of the bulk 2H phase, now we compare to polytypes (1H monolayer and
3R bulk), to determine favorable sites for Ni and the doping effect on
structure, electronic properties, and the layer dissociation energy. The most
favorable intercalation/adatom sites are tetrahedral intercalation for 3R (like
2H) and Mo-atop for 1H. The relative energies indicate a possibility of phase
change from 2H to 3R with substitution of Mo or S. We find structural and
electronic properties that can be used to identify the doping sites, including
metallic behavior in Mo-substituted 3R and 2H, and in-gap states for Mo- and
S-substituted 1H, which could have interesting optoelectronic applications. We
observe a large enhancement in the interlayer interactions of Ni-doped MoS$_2$,
opposite to the effect of other transition metals. For lubrication
applications, this increased layer dissociation energy could be the mechanism
of low wear. Our systematic study shows the effect of doping concentration and
we extrapolate to the low-doping limit. This work gives insight into the
previously unclear structure of Ni-doped MoS$_2$ and how it can be detected
experimentally, the relation of energy and structures of doped monolayers and
bulk systems, the electronic properties under doping, and the effect of doping

then measuring the expectation value of the molecular Hamiltonian. Due to
finite coherence times and frequent gate errors, the number of gates that can
be implemented remains limited on current quantum devices, preventing accurate
applications to systems with significant entanglement, such as strongly

is removed entirely and replaced by a quantum control routine which
variationally shapes a pulse to drive the initial Hartree-Fock state to the

removing the quantum circuit, the coherence times required for state

low angular momentum material from the infalling stellar envelope will
circularize into an accretion disk located just outside the black hole horizon,
resulting in high accretion rates necessary to power a GRB jet. Temperatures in
the disk midplane at these small radii are sufficiently high to dissociate
nuclei, while outflows from the disk can be neutron-rich and may synthesize
r-process nuclei. However, at later times, and for high progenitor angular
momentum, the outer layers of the stellar envelope can circularize at larger
radii $\gtrsim 10^{7}$ cm, where nuclear reaction can take place in the disk
midplane ((e.g.~$^{4}$He + $^{16}$O $\rightarrow$ $^{20}$Ne + $\gamma$).. Here
we explore the effects of nuclear burning on collapsar accretion disks and
their outflows by means of hydrodynamical $\alpha$-viscosity torus simulations
coupled to a 19-isotope nuclear reaction network, which are designed to mimic
the late infall epochs in collapsar evolution when the viscous time of the
torus has become comparable to the envelope fall-back time. Our results address
several key questions, such as the conditions for quiescent burning and
accretion versus detonation and the generation of $^{56}$Ni in disk outflows,

located in the slowest, innermost layers of the ejecta, the latter could
provide the radioactive heating source necessary to make the spectral

First, we use quantum chemistry simulations to explore the entire field of

atmospheres. In this process, we discover 33 new reactions with no previously
known rate coefficients. From here, we develop a consistent reduced atmospheric

chemical kinetic model (ChemKM) to compute the HCN abundance as a function of
atmospheric depth on Titan. Our simulated atmospheric HCN profile agrees very
well with the Cassini observations. CRAHCN contains 104 reactions however
nearly all of the simulated atmospheric HCN profile can be obtained using a
scaled down network of only 19 dominant reactions. From here, we form a
complete picture of HCN chemistry in Titan's atmosphere, from the dissociation
of the main atmospheric species, down to the direct production of HCN along 4
major channels. One of these channels was first discovered and characterized in

excess radiation background above the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at low
frequencies. Their effect on the redshifted 21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen is
usually neglected, as it is assumed that the associated background is small.
Recently, an excess radio background above the level of the CMB has been
proposed as one of the possible explanations for the unusually strong 21-cm
signal from redshift $z\sim 17$ reported by the EDGES collaboration. As a
result, the implications of a smooth and extremely strong excess radio
background on both the sky-averaged (global) 21-cm signal and its fluctuations
have been considered. Here we take into account the inhomogeneity of the radio
background created by a population of high-redshift galaxies, and show that it
adds a new type of 21-cm fluctuations to the well-known contributions of
density, velocity, Ly-${\alpha}$ coupling, heating and reionization. We find
that a population of high-redshift galaxies even with a moderately-enhanced
radio efficiency (unrelated to the EDGES result) can have a significant effect
on the 21-cm power spectrum and global signal in models with weak X-ray
heating. For models that can explain the EDGES data, we conduct a large
parameter survey to explore their signatures. We show that in such models the
21-cm power spectrum at $z\sim 17$ is enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude
compared to the CMB-only standard case, and the shape and time evolution of the
power spectrum is significantly modified by the radio fluctuations. These
fluctuations are within reach of upcoming radio interferometers. We also find
that these models can be significantly constrained by current and future
observations of radio sources.

with large, complex, dynamically-evolving sunspots. This points to the
importance of monitoring the evolution of starspots, not only in visible but
also in ultra violet (UV) and X-rays, in understanding the origin and
occurrence of stellar flares. To this end, we perform spectral irradiance
analysis on different types of transiting solar active regions by using a
variety of full-disk synoptic observations. The target events are an isolated
sunspot, spotless plage, and emerging flux in prolonged quiet-Sun conditions
selected from the past decade. We find that the visible continuum and total
solar irradiance become darkened when the spot is at the central meridian,
whereas it is bright near the solar limb; UV bands sensitive to the
chromosphere correlate well with the variation of total unsigned magnetic flux
in the photosphere; amplitudes of EUV and soft X-ray increase with the
characteristic temperature, whose light curves are flat-topped due to their
sensitivity to the optically thin corona; the transiting spotless plage does
not show the darkening in the visible irradiance, while the emerging flux
produces an asymmetry in all light curves about the central meridian. The
multi-wavelength sun-as-a-star study described here indicates that such time
lags between the coronal and photospheric light curves have the potential to
probe the extent of coronal magnetic fields above the starspots. In addition,
EUV wavelengths that are sensitive to the transition-region temperature
sometimes show anti-phased variations, which may be used for diagnosing plasmas
around starspots.

cluster population forming in a high-resolution GRIFFIN project simulation of a
metal-poor dwarf galaxy starburst. The star clusters, which follow a power-law
mass distribution, form from the cold ISM phase with an IMF sampled with
individual stars down to 4 solar masses at sub-parsec spatial resolution.
Massive stars and their important feedback mechanisms are modelled in detail.
The simulated clusters follow a surprisingly tight relation between the
specific angular momentum and mass with indications of two sub-populations.
Massive clusters ($M_\mathrm{cl}\gtrsim 3\times 10^4 M_{\odot})$ have the
highest specific angular momenta at low ellipticities ($\epsilon\sim 0.2$) and
show alignment between their shapes and rotation. Lower mass clusters have
lower specific angular momenta with larger scatter, show a broader range of
elongations, and are typically misaligned indicating that they are not shaped
by rotation. The most massive clusters $(M \gtrsim 10^5\,M_{\odot})$ accrete
gas and proto-clusters from a $ \lesssim 100\,\rm pc$ scale local galactic
environment on a $t \lesssim 10\,\rm Myr$ timescale, inheriting the ambient
angular momentum properties. Their two-dimensional kinematic maps show ordered
rotation at formation, up to $v \sim 8.5\,\rm km s^{-1}$, consistent with
observed young massive clusters and old globular clusters, which they might
evolve into. The massive clusters have angular momentum parameters
$\lambda_R\lesssim 0.5$ and show Gauss-Hermite coefficients $h_3$ that are
anti-correlated with the velocity, indicating asymmetric line-of-sight velocity
distributions as a signature of a dissipative formation process.

present optical and UV data on onee such object, SN 2018gep, that displayed a
fast rise with a mostly featureless blue continuum around maximum light, and
evolved to develop broad features more typical of a SN Ic-bl while retaining
significant amounts of blue flux throughout its observations. The blue excess
is most evident in its near-UV flux that is over 4 magnitudes brighter than
other stripped envelope supernovae, but also visible in optical g$-$r colors at
early times. Its fast rise time of $t_{\rm rise,V} \lesssim 6.2 \pm 0.8$ days
puts it squarely in the emerging class of Fast Evolving Luminous Transients, or
Fast Blue Optical Transients. With a peak absolute magnitude of M$_r=-19.49 \pm

iPTF16asu, for which less of the important early time and UV data have been

interpret high-$z$ galaxy luminosity functions and make predictions for future
galaxy surveys. A common approach assumes a ""universal"" star formation
efficiency, $f_{\ast}$, independent of cosmic time but strongly dependent on
the masses of dark matter halos. Though this class of models has been very
successful in matching observations over much of cosmic history, simple stellar
feedback models do predict redshift evolution in $f_{\ast}$, and are commonly
used in semi-analytic models. In this work, we calibrate a set of universal
$f_{\ast}$ and feedback-regulated models to the same set of rest-ultraviolet $z
\gtrsim 4$ observations, and find that a rapid, $\sim (1+z)^{-3/2}$ decline in
both the efficiency of dust production and duty cycle of star formation are
needed to reconcile feedback-regulated models with current observations. By
construction, these models remain nearly identical to universal $f_{\ast}$
models in rest-ultraviolet luminosity functions and colours. As a result, the
only way to distinguish these competing scenarios is either via (i) improved
constraints on the clustering of galaxies -- universal and feedback-regulated
models differ in predictions for the galaxy bias by $0.1 \lesssim \Delta
\langle b \rangle \lesssim 0.3$ over $4 \lesssim z \lesssim 10$ -- or (ii)
independent constraints on the dust contents and/or duty cycle of star
formation. This suggests that improved constraints on the `dustiness' and
`burstiness' of high-$z$ galaxies will not merely add clarity to a given model
of star formation in high-$z$ galaxies, but rather fundamentally determine our
ability to identify the correct model in the first place.

wavelengths has provided a wealth of information about the universe. However,
at PeV (10$^{15}$ eV) energies and above, most of the universe is impenetrable
to photons. New messengers, namely cosmic neutrinos, are needed to explore the
most extreme environments of the universe where black holes, neutron stars, and
stellar explosions transform gravitational energy into non-thermal cosmic rays.
The discovery of cosmic neutrinos with IceCube has opened this new window on
the universe. In this white paper, we present an overview of a next-generation
instrument, IceCube-Gen2, which will sharpen our understanding of the processes
and environments that govern the universe at the highest energies. IceCube-Gen2
is designed to: 1) Resolve the high-energy neutrino sky from TeV to EeV
energies; 2) Investigate cosmic particle acceleration through multi-messenger
observations; 3) Reveal the sources and propagation of the highest energy
particles in the universe; 4) Probe fundamental physics with high-energy
neutrinos. IceCube-Gen2 will increase the annual rate of observed cosmic
neutrinos by a factor of ten compared to IceCube, and will be able to detect
sources five times fainter than its predecessor. Furthermore, through the
addition of a radio array, IceCube-Gen2 will extend the energy range by several
orders of magnitude compared to IceCube. Construction will take 8 years and
cost about \$350M. The goal is to have IceCube-Gen2 fully operational by 2033.
IceCube-Gen2 will play an essential role in shaping the new era of
multi-messenger astronomy, fundamentally advancing our knowledge of the
high-energy universe. This challenging mission can be fully addressed only in
concert with the new survey instruments across the electromagnetic spectrum and
gravitational wave detectors which will be available in the coming years.

and latitude of the direction of aphelion, $L$ and $B$. Using the analytical
solutions, we show that the ratio of the periods of the evolution of $L$ and
$B$ is very close to either 2 or $\infty$ for initial eccentricities $e_i\simeq
1$, as is true for the Oort cloud comets. From the relation between $L$ and
$B$, we predict that Oort cloud comets returning to the planetary region are
concentrated on the ecliptic plane and a second plane, which we call the ""empty
ecliptic."" This consists in a rotation of the ecliptic around the Galactic pole
by 180$^\circ$. Our numerical integrations confirm that the radial component of
the Galactic tide, which is neglected in the derivation of the analytical
solutions, is not strong enough to break the relation between $L$ and $B$
derived analytically. Brief examination of observational data shows that there
are concentrations near both the ecliptic and the empty ecliptic. We also show
that the anomalies of the distribution of $B$ of long-period comets mentioned

Lifshitz transition, where two Dirac cones merge. At the transition, the
electronic spectrum is characterized by massive quadratic dispersion in one
direction, while it remains linear in the other. We have found that, to lowest
order, the unconventional log squared (double logarithmic) correction to the
quasiparticle mass in bare perturbation theory leads to resummation into strong
mass renormalization in the exact full solution of the perturbative
renormalization group equations. This behavior effectively wipes out the
curvature of the dispersion and leads to Dirac cone restoration at low energy:
the system flows towards Dirac dispersion which is anisotropic but linear in
momentum, with interaction-depended logarithmic modulation. The Berry phase
associated with the restored critical Dirac spectrum is zero - a property
guaranteed by time-reversal symmetry and unchanged by renormalization. Our
results are in contrast with the behavior that has been found within the

probes may be revolutionary in studying entangled matter such as unconventional
phases of strongly correlated systems. Our presentation focuses on a neutron
beam probe that is mode-entangled in spin and path as is experimentally
realized in [1], although similar ideas also apply to photon probes. We
generalize the traditional van Hove theory [2] whereby the response is written
as a properly-crafted combination of two-point correlation functions. Tuning
the probe's entanglement length allows us to interrogate spatial scales of
interest by analyzing interference patterns in the differential cross-section.
Remarkably, for a spin dimer target we find that the typical Young-like
interference pattern observed if the target state is un-entangled gets quantum
erased when that state becomes maximally entangled.

means of measuring SFR in high redshift galaxies that is unaffected by dust
obscuration. In this study, we make the first test for redshift evolution in

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) GOODS North field. Using a stacking analysis we
compare the observed radio continuum luminosities with those predicted from the
dust-corrected H$\alpha$ SFR assuming a range of $z\sim0$ relations. We find no
evidence for a systematic evolution with redshift, when stacking the radio
continuum as a function of dust-corrected H$\alpha$ SFR and when stacking both
optical spectroscopy and radio continuum as a function of stellar mass. We
conclude that locally calibrated relations between SFR and radio continuum

helicity soft graviton is equivalent to the Ward identities for

$\overline{SL(2,\mathbb C)}$ current algebra living on the celestial sphere.
The generators of the $\overline{SL(2,\mathbb C)}$ current algebra and the
supertranslations, coming from a positive helicity leading soft graviton, form
a closed algebra. We find that the OPE of two graviton primaries in the
Celestial CFT, extracted from MHV amplitudes, is completely determined in terms
of this algebra. To be more precise, 1) The subleading terms in the OPE are
determined in terms of the leading OPE coefficient if we demand that both sides
of the OPE transform in the same way under this local symmetry algebra. 2)
Positive helicity gravitons have null states under this local algebra whose
decoupling leads to differential equations for MHV amplitudes. An $n$ point MHV
amplitude satisfies two systems of $(n-2)$ linear first order PDEs
corresponding to $(n-2)$ positive helicity gravitons. We have checked, using
Hodges' formula, that one system of differential equations is satisfied by any
MHV amplitude, whereas the other system has been checked up to six graviton MHV
amplitude. 3) One can determine the leading OPE coefficients from these
differential equations.
  This points to the existence of an autonomous sector of the Celestial CFT
which holographically computes the MHV graviton scattering amplitudes and is
completely defined by this local symmetry algebra. The MHV-sector of the
Celestial CFT is like a minimal model of $2$-D CFT.

Owing to exponential increase in cases of COVID-19, the pandemic will ensue in

and statistics. However, while they enjoy desirable statistical properties,
they have an obvious drawback in that the computation becomes impractical as
the data size $n$ increases. Specifically, the number of combinations, say $m$,
that a U-statistic of order $d$ has to evaluate is $O(n^d)$. Many efforts have
been made to approximate the original U-statistic using a small subset of

incomplete U-statistic. To the best of our knowledge, all existing methods
require $m$ to grow at least faster than $n$, albeit more slowly than $n^d$, in
order for the corresponding incomplete U-statistic to be asymptotically
efficient in terms of the mean squared error. In this paper, we introduce a new
type of incomplete U-statistic that can be asymptotically efficient, even when
$m$ grows more slowly than $n$. In some cases, $m$ is only required to grow
faster than $\sqrt{n}$. Our theoretical and empirical results both show

is shown that their electrokinetic (zeta) potential is generally augmented
compared to the surface electrostatic potential, thanks to a large liquid slip
at their surface emerging due to an electro-osmotic flow in the enriched by
counter-ions porous films. The inner flow shows a very rich behavior controlled
by the volume charge density of the coating, its Brinkman length, and
concentration of added salt. Interestingly, even for relatively small Brinkman
length the zeta-potential can, in some cases, become huge, providing a very
fast outer flow in the bulk electrolyte. When the Brinkman length is large
enough, the zeta-potential could be extremely high even at practically
vanishing surface potential.
  To describe the slip velocity in a simple manner, we introduce a concept of
an electro-osmotic slip length and demonstrate that the latter is always
defined by the hydrodynamic permeability of the porous film, and also,
depending on the regime, either by its volume charge density or

amplify as successive driver reactions propagate from the errant vehicle to
vehicles upstream. Known as phantom jams, this phenomenon has been identified
in the literature as one of the main causes of traffic congestion. This paper
is based on the premise that vehicle automation and connectivity can help
mitigate such jams. In the paper, we design a controller for use in a connected
and autonomous vehicle (CAV) to stabilize the flow of human-driven vehicles
(HDVs) that are upstream of the CAV, and consequently to lower collision risk
in the upstream traffic environment. In modeling the HDV dynamics in the mixed
traffic stream, we duly consider HDV driver heterogeneity and the time delays
associated with their perception reaction time. We can find that the maximum
number of HDVs that a CAV can stabilize is lower when human drivers potential
time delay and heterogeneity are considered, compared to the scenario where
such are not considered. This result suggests that heterogeneity and time delay
in HDV behavior impairs the CAVs capability to stabilize traffic. Therefore, in
designing CAV controllers for traffic stabilization, it is essential to
consider such uncertainty-related conditions. In our demonstration, we also
show that the designed controller can significantly improve both the stability
of the mixed traffic stream and the safety of both CAVs and HDVs in the stream.
The results are useful for real-time calibration of the model parameters that
characterize HDV movements in the mixed stream.

power transfer (SWIPT) system enabled with massive multiple-input
multiple-output (MIMO) is studied. A base station (BS) with a large number of
antennas transmits energy and information signals to its intended users, but
these signals are also received by an active eavesdropper. The users and
eavesdropper employ a power splitting technique to simultaneously decode
information and harvest energy. Massive MIMO helps the BS to focus energy to
the users and prevent information leakage to the eavesdropper. The harvested
energy by each user is employed for decoding information and transmitting
uplink pilot signals for channel estimation. It is assumed that the active
eavesdropper also harvests energy in the downlink and then contributes during
the uplink training phase. Achievable secrecy rate is considered as the
performance criterion and a closed-form lower bound for it is derived. To
provide secure transmission, the achievable secrecy rate is then maximized
through an optimization problem with constraints on the minimum harvested
energy by the user and the maximum harvested energy by the eavesdropper.
Numerical results show the effectiveness of using massive MIMO in providing
physical layer security in SWIPT systems and also show that our closed-form

quantum correlated NESS may be dissipatively prepared and, secondly, they
increase the attainable concurrence. Most remarkably, we find a heat current

is presented here in a model of symplectic fermions with a nonlocal

quartic interaction. We identify the Banach space of interactions, which the
fixed point belongs to, and we determine it via a convergent approximation
scheme. The Banach space is not limited to relevant interactions, but it
contains all possible irrelevant terms with short-ranged kernels, decaying like
a stretched exponential at large distances. As the model shares a number of
features in common with $\phi^4$ or Ising models, the result can be used as a
benchmark to test the validity of truncations and approximations in RG studies.

broadening pattern of the back-to-back peak in the relative azimuthal angle

with gold nuclei. Our results suggest that photon+jet final states in inclusive

gluon saturation that is complementary to inclusive and diffractive dijet
production. They also provide a sensitive empirical test of the universality of
dipole matrix elements when compared to identical measurements in
proton-nucleus collisions. However because photon+jet correlations at small $x$

self-supervision information within the input image itself. We observe that,
when analyzing images, human eyes often compare images against each other
instead of examining images individually. In addition, they often pay attention
to certain keypoints, image regions, or objects which are discriminative
between image classes but highly consistent within classes. Even if the image
is being transformed, the attention pattern will be consistent. Motivated by
this observation, we develop a new approach to unsupervised deep metric
learning where the network is learned based on self-supervision information
across images instead of within one single image. To characterize the
consistent pattern of human attention during image comparisons, we introduce
the idea of transformed attention consistency. It assumes that visually similar
images, even undergoing different image transforms, should share the same
consistent visual attention map. This consistency leads to a pairwise
self-supervision loss, allowing us to learn a Siamese deep neural network to
encode and compare images against their transformed or matched pairs. To
further enhance the inter-class discriminative power of the feature generated
by this network, we adapt the concept of triplet loss from supervised metric
learning to our unsupervised case and introduce the contrastive clustering
loss. Our extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for
unsupervised metric learning by a large margin.

single-layer networks defined by one inter-agent sensing modality and agents
homogeneous in protocol. We define and analyze the heterogeneous multiplex LTM
to study spread on multi-layer networks with each layer representing a
different sensing modality and agents heterogeneous in protocol. Protocols are
designed to distinguish signals from different layers: an agent becomes active
if a sufficient number of its neighbors in each of any $a$ of the $m$ layers is
active. We focus on Protocol OR, when $a=1$, and Protocol AND, when $a=m$,
which model agents that are most and least readily activated, respectively. We
develop theory and algorithms to compute the size of the spread at steady state
for any set of initially active agents and to analyze the role of distinguished
sensing modalities, network structure, and heterogeneity. We show how
heterogeneity manages the tension in spreading dynamics between sensitivity to
inputs and robustness to disturbances.

distribution to another such that the Kullback-Leibler and R\'enyi divergences
between the two distributions are symmetric. Two general classes of link models
are proposed. The first model links two survival functions and is applicable to
models such as the proportional odds and change point, which are used in
survival analysis and reliability modeling. A prototype application involving
the proportional odds model demonstrates advantages of symmetric divergence
measures over asymmetric measures for assessing the efficacy of features and
for model averaging purposes. The advantages include providing unique ranks for
models and unique information weights for model averaging with one-half as much
computation requirement of asymmetric divergences. The second model links two
cumulative probability distribution functions. This model produces a
generalized location model which are continuous counterparts of the binary
probability models such as probit and logit models. Examples include the
generalized probit and logit models which have appeared in the survival
analysis literature, and a generalized Laplace model and a generalized

critical in order to increase the scope of reinforcement learning. It will both
increase the diversity of learned skills and reduce the burden of manually
designing reward functions for each skill. Self-supervised agents, setting
their own goals, and trying to maximize the diversity of those goals have shown
great promise towards this end. However, a currently known limitation of agents
trying to maximize the diversity of sampled goals is that they tend to get
attracted to noise or more generally to parts of the environments that cannot
be controlled (distractors). When agents have access to predefined goal
features or expert knowledge, absolute Learning Progress (ALP) provides a way
to distinguish between regions that can be controlled and those that cannot.
However, those methods often fall short when the agents are only provided with
raw sensory inputs such as images. In this work we extend those concepts to
unsupervised image-based goal exploration. We propose a framework that allows
agents to autonomously identify and ignore noisy distracting regions while
searching for novelty in the learnable regions to both improve overall
performance and avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our framework can be combined
with any state-of-the-art novelty seeking goal exploration approaches. We
construct a rich 3D image based environment with distractors. Experiments on
this environment show that agents using our framework successfully identify

``\textit{What is the critical growth rate of the dimension $p$ as a function
of the sample size $n$ for which the Central Limit Theorem holds uniformly over
the collection of $p$-dimensional hyper-rectangles ?''}. Specifically, we are
interested in the normal approximation of suitably scaled versions of the sum
$\sum_{i=1}^{n}X_i$ in $\mathcal{R}^p$ uniformly over the class of
hyper-rectangles
$\mathcal{A}^{re}=\{\prod_{j=1}^{p}[a_j,b_j]\cap\mathcal{R}:-\infty\leq a_j\leq
b_j \leq \infty, j=1,\ldots,p\}$, where $X_1,\dots,X_n$ are independent
$p-$dimensional random vectors with each having independent and identically
distributed (iid) components. We investigate the critical cut-off rate of $\log
p$ below which the uniform central limit theorem (CLT) holds and above which it
fails. According to some recent results of Chernozukov et al. (2017), it is
well known that the CLT holds uniformly over $\mathcal{A}^{re}$ if $\log
p=o\big(n^{1/7}\big)$. They also conjectured that for CLT to hold uniformly
over $\mathcal{A}^{re}$, the optimal rate is $\log p = o\big(n^{1/3}\big)$. We
show instead that under some conditions, the CLT holds uniformly over
$\mathcal{A}^{re}$, when $\log p=o\big(n^{1/2}\big)$. More precisely, we show
that if $\log p =\epsilon \sqrt{n}$ for some sufficiently small $\epsilon>0$,
the normal approximation is valid with an error $\epsilon$, uniformly over
$\mathcal{A}^{re}$. Further, we show by an example that the uniform CLT over
$\mathcal{A}^{re}$ fails if $\limsup_{t\rightarrow \infty} n^{-(1/2+\delta)}
\log p >0$ for some $\delta>0$. Hence the critical rate of the growth of $p$
for the validity of the CLT is given by $\log p=o\big(n^{1/2}\big)$.

theory we have systematically investigated the structural, electronic, and
magnetic properties of NdNiO$_2$/SrTiO$_3$ and CaCuO$_2$/SrTiO$_3$ systems. Our
results revealed a strong lattice reconstruction in the case of
NdNiO$_2$/SrTiO$_3$, resulting in a polar film, with the surface and
interfacial NiO$_2$ layers presenting opposite displacements. However, for
CaCuO$_2$/SrTiO$_3$, the distortions of those same two CuO$_2$ layers were in
the same direction. In addition, we found this distortion to be approximately
independent of the studied range of film thickness for both the nickelate and
cuprates films. Furthermore, we also observed a two-dimensional electron gas at
the interface between NdNiO$_2$ and SrTiO$_3$, caused by the polar
discontinuity, in agreement with recent literature. For NdNiO$_2$/SrTiO$_3$ the
two-dimensional electron gas extends over several layers, while for
CaCuO$_2$/SrTiO$_3$ this electronic rearrangement is very localized at the
interface between CaCuO$_2$ and SrTiO$_3$. The electronic reconstruction found
at the interface involves a strong occupation of the Ti $3d_{xy}$ state. In
both cases, there is a significant electronic charge transfer from the surface
Ni or Cu layers to the Ti interface layer. The interfacial Ni and Cu layer is
hole and electron doped, respectively. By introducing magnetism and electronic
correlation, we observed that the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital of Ni becomes
itinerant while the same orbital for Cu remains doubly occupied, establishing a
clear two- vs one-orbital active framework for the description of these
systems.

fact that the intensity range is much wider and denser than those in

Above all, intensity values in PET have absolute significance, and are used to
compute parameters that are reproducible across the population. Yet, usually
much manual adjustment has to be made in pre-/post- processing when
synthesizing PET images, because its intensity ranges can vary a lot, e.g.,
between -100 to 1000 in floating point values. To overcome these challenges, we
adopt the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)
algorithm that has had great success in natural language processing (NLP),
where wide-range floating point intensity values are represented as integers
ranging between 0 to 10000 that resemble a dictionary of natural language
vocabularies. BERT is then trained to predict a proportion of masked values
images, where its ""next sentence prediction (NSP)"" acts as GAN discriminator.
Our proposed approach, is able to generate PET images from MRI images in wide
intensity range, with no manual adjustments in pre-/post- processing. It is a
method that can scale and ready to deploy.

study of the impact of submitting letters of recommendation on subsequent
admission, with the goal of estimating how impacts vary across pre-defined
subgroups. Understanding this variation is challenging in observational
studies, however, because estimated impacts reflect both actual treatment
effect variation and differences in covariate balance across groups. To address
this, we develop balancing weights that directly optimize for ``local balance''
within subgroups while maintaining global covariate balance between treated and
control units. We then show that this approach has a dual representation as a
form of inverse propensity score weighting with a hierarchical propensity score
model. In the UC Berkeley pilot study, our proposed approach yields excellent
local and global balance, unlike more traditional weighting methods, which fail
to balance covariates within subgroups. We find that the impact of letters of
recommendation increases with the predicted probability of admission, with
mixed evidence of differences for under-represented minority applicants.

techniques with the highest dosage of radiation. Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(MRI), in contrast, is more widely available and provides more flexibility when
setting the desired image resolution. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of AD using
MRI is difficult due to the very subtle physiological differences between
healthy and AD subjects visible on MRI. As a result, many attempts have been
made to synthesize PET images from MR images using generative adversarial
networks (GANs) in the interest of enabling the diagnosis of AD from MR.
Existing work on PET synthesis from MRI has largely focused on Conditional
GANs, where MR images are used to generate PET images and subsequently used for
AD diagnosis. There is no end-to-end training goal. This paper proposes an
alternative approach to the aforementioned, where AD diagnosis is incorporated
in the GAN training objective to achieve the best AD classification
performance. Different GAN lossesare fine-tuned based on the discriminator
performance, and the overall training is stabilized. The proposed network
architecture and training regime show state-of-the-art performance for three-

and transitive preference relation over a fixed set of alternatives. While
completeness of preferences is usually regarded as a strong assumption,
weakening it requires care to ensure that the resulting model still has enough
structure to yield interesting results. This paper takes a step in this
direction by studying the class of ""connected preferences"", that is,
preferences that may fail to be complete but have connected maximal domains of
comparability. We offer four new results. Theorem 1 identifies a basic
necessary condition for a continuous preference to be connected in the sense
above, while Theorem 2 provides sufficient conditions. Building on the latter,
Theorem 3 characterizes the maximal domains of comparability. Finally, Theorem
4 presents conditions that ensure that maximal domains are arc-connected.

mid-UV features. SN 2011fe is the best observed core-normal SNe Ia, therefore

between different metalicities and progenitor scenarios of Type Ia supernovae,

many biological and medical systems. Bubble cavitation can induce such strain
rates, and the resulting bubble dynamics are sensitive to the material
properties. Thus, in principle, these properties can be inferred via
measurements of the bubble dynamics. Estrada et al. (2018) demonstrated such
bubble-dynamic high-strain-rate rheometry by using least-squares shooting to
minimize the difference between simulated and experimental bubble radius
histories. We generalize their technique to account for additional
uncertainties in the model, initial conditions, and material properties needed
to uniquely simulate the bubble dynamics. Ensemble-based data assimilation
minimizes the computational expense associated with the bubble cavitation
model. We test an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), an iterative ensemble Kalman
smoother (IEnKS), and a hybrid ensemble-based 4D--Var method (En4D--Var) on
synthetic data, assessing their estimations of the viscosity and shear modulus
of a Kelvin--Voigt material. Results show that En4D--Var and IEnKS provide
better moduli estimates than EnKF. Applying these methods to the experimental
data of Estrada et al. (2018) yields similar material property estimates to
those they obtained, but provides additional information about uncertainties.
In particular, the En4D--Var yields lower viscosity estimates for some
experiments, and the dynamic estimators reveal a potential mechanism that is
unaccounted for in the model, whereby the viscosity is reduced in some cases
due to material damage occurring at bubble collapse.

reveal that they can increase the carrier density by up to 200 times. This
persistent photoconductivity appears to be dominated by contributions from the
multilayer MoS$_2$ domains, and we attribute the flake-wide response in part to
charge transfer across the heterointerface. Spatial correlation of our SMM

Fermi-liquid-like behaviour, heavily overdoped high-Tc cuprates sport several
unexpected features. Thermodynamic properties expected to be roughly constant
with doping decrease towards zero, signalling that a growing fraction of
carriers remain in the normal state below Tc. Near Tc, the superconducting
energy gap fills in with temperature, contrary to the expectations of BCS
theory. Most recently a transition in the Hall number of some cuprates was
found to extend to a very high doping (x~0.27), far beyond the pseudogap
critical point identified by a peak in thermodynamic properties (x=0.19). This
presents a challenge to the view that the pseudogap is a consequence of Fermi
surface reconstruction. In this paper we present a consistent explanation for
all these observations by combining pair-breaking scattering with a Fermi
surface reconstruction model for the pseudogap. Notably, an increase in
pair-breaking with doping leads to a separation of the points where
reconstruction begins and the thermodynamic properties peak. This result
highlights pair-breaking as an essential ingredient in the electronic recipe
for heavily overdoped cuprate superconductors.

Instead, they get trapped in the old phase and accumulate to form macroscopic
objects, dubbed Fermi-balls. We show that Fermi-balls can explain the DM
abundance in a wide range of models and parameter space, depending most
crucially on the dark-fermion asymmetry and the phase transition energy scale
(possible up to the Planck scale). They are stable by the balance between
fermion's quantum pressure against free energy release, hence turn out to be
macroscopic in mass and size. However, this scenario generally produces no
detectable signals (which may explain the null results of DM searches), except
for detectable gravitational waves (GWs) for electroweak scale phase
transitions; although the detection of such stochastic GWs does not necessarily

unit radius is determined by both numerical and analytical techniques. A
numerical solution is obtained by enclosing the system in an outer cylinder of
radius R_0>>1, on which different boundary conditions can be imposed. With a
gap 2epsilon between the inner cylinders, attention is focused on the small gap
situation epsilon<<1 when lubrication theory becomes applicable. Good agreement
with the numerical solution is obtained for both counter-rotating and
co-rotating cases. In the counter-rotating situation, the total force F acting
on the cylinders is determined. Numerical evidence is presented for the
conclusion that F~log(R_0)^-1 as R_0->infty. An exact analytic solution is
obtained in the contact limit epsilon=0, and a contact force in F_c is
identified, which contributes to the torque that each cylinder experiences
about its axis. The far-field torque doublet is also identified. The manner in
which the flow topology adapts to the change in topology of the fluid domain
when the cylinders are brought into contact is noted. The sliced-cylinder
situation when epsilon<0 is also considered, and in this case a distributed
contact force is identified, and a similarity solution is found that describes
the flow near the corner singularities. In the case of co-rotating cylinders,
the theory of Watson is elucidated and shown to agree well with the numerical
solution and with lubrication theory when epsilon<0.01. The torque generated by
the co-rotation of the cylinders is determined, with asymptotic value ~17.25 as
epsilon->0. An alternative exact analytic solution in the contact limit is
obtained, for which the torque is zero and the far-field flow is one of uniform
rotation; in a rotating frame of reference in which the fluid at infinity is at
rest, the relative flow in this case is identified as a `radial quadrupole'.

hypermagnetic field in the early universe with an assumption that the flavon of
the Froggatt-Nielsen carries an asymmetry. Through the decay of the flavon to
Standard Model fermions, this asymmetry is transferred to fermions, where the
right-handed electron keeps its asymmetry while its Yukawa interaction is out
of thermal equilibrium. Through the existence of the flavon, we can ensure that
the freezing-in temperature of the right-handed electron is closer to the
electroweak phase transition than the Standard cosmology scenario. With this
trick, the asymmetry in the right-handed electron is saved for a longer time.
Moreover, the injection of the asymmetry to the right-handed electron is
gradual, which helps the preservation of the asymmetry in the right-handed
sector significantly. Due to the intimate relationship between fermion number
violation and the helicity of the hypermagnetic field, some of the asymmetry is
used to amplify the hypermagnetic field which itself helps to preserve the
remnant asymmetry through keeping the Yukawa processes out of thermal
equilibrium. We find the sweet region of the parameter space that can produce
the right asymmetry in the baryons while generating a large hypermagnetic field

fast-forwarding agent, which periodically chooses from multiple strategies to
selectively process video frames and transmits the selected frames at

to discriminate 100 different fabric textures, the spatially and temporally
selective attention has resulted in a significant improvement of the

and partially incorrect, making interpreting structures and activities of such
networks challenging. For legal reasons, real data about active covert networks
is inaccessible to researchers. To address these challenges, we introduce here
a network generator for synthetic networks that are statistically similar to a
real network but void of personal information about its members. The generator
uses statistical data about a real or imagined covert organization network. It
generates randomized instances of the Stochastic Block model of the network
groups but preserves this network organizational structure. The direct use of
such anonymized networks is for training on them the research and analytical
tools for finding structure and dynamics of covert networks. Since these
synthetic networks differ in their sets of edges and communities, they can be
used as a new source for network analytics. First, they provide alternative
interpretations of the data about the original network. The distribution of
probabilities for these alternative interpretations enables new network
analytics. The analysts can find community structures which are frequent,
therefore stable under perturbations. They may also analyze how the stability
changes with the strength of perturbation. For covert networks, the analysts
can quantify statistically expected outcomes of interdiction. This kind of
analytics applies to all complex network in which the data are incomplete or
partially incorrect.

analysis of matrices, including the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and
related low-rank approximation techniques. QR with Column Pivoting (QRCP) is
usually suitable for these purposes, but it can be much slower than the
unpivoted QR algorithm. For large matrices, the difference in performance is
due to increased communication between the processor and slow memory, which
QRCP needs in order to choose pivots during decomposition. Our main algorithm,
Randomized QR with Column Pivoting (RQRCP), uses randomized projection to make
pivot decisions from a much smaller sample matrix, which we can construct to
reside in a faster level of memory than the original matrix. This technique may
be understood as trading vastly reduced communication for a controlled increase
in uncertainty during the decision process. For rank-revealing purposes, the
selection mechanism in RQRCP produces results that are the same quality as the
standard algorithm, but with performance near that of unpivoted QR (often an
order of magnitude faster for large matrices). We also propose two formulas
that facilitate further performance improvements. The first efficiently updates
sample matrices to avoid computing new randomized projections. The second
avoids large trailing updates during the decomposition in truncated low-rank
approximations. Our truncated version of RQRCP also provides a key initial step
in our truncated SVD approximation, TUXV. These advances open up a new
performance domain for large matrix factorizations that will support efficient
problem-solving techniques for challenging applications in science,
engineering, and data analysis.

from traditional consensus-based fully-replicated designs. One direction is to
explore the usage of sharding in which we partition the managed dataset over
many shards that independently operate as blockchains. Sharding requires an
efficient fault-tolerant primitive for the ordering and execution of
multi-shard transactions, however.
  In this work, we seek to design such a primitive suitable for distributed
ledger networks with high transaction throughput. To do so, we propose
Cerberus, a set of minimalistic primitives for processing single-shard and
multi-shard UTXO-like transactions. Cerberus aims at maximizing parallel
processing at shards while minimizing coordination within and between shards.
First, we propose Core-Cerberus, that uses strict environmental requirements to
enable simple yet powerful multi-shard transaction processing. In our intended
UTXO-environment, Core-Cerberus will operate perfectly with respect to all
transactions proposed and approved by well-behaved clients, but does not
provide any guarantees for other transactions.
  To also support more general-purpose environments, we propose two
generalizations of Core-Cerberus: we propose Optimistic-Cerberus, a protocol
that does not require any additional coordination phases in the well-behaved
optimistic case, while requiring intricate coordination when recovering from
attacks; and we propose Pessimistic-Cerberus, a protocol that adds sufficient
coordination to the well-behaved case of Core-Cerberus, allowing it to operate
in a general-purpose fault-tolerant environments without significant costs to
recover from attacks. Finally, we compare the three protocols, showing their
potential scalability and high transaction throughput in practical

years. Yet, human grasps are still difficult to synthesize realistically. There
are several key reasons: (1) the human hand has many degrees of freedom (more
than robotic manipulators); (2) the synthesized hand should conform to the
surface of the object; and (3) it should interact with the object in a
semantically and physically plausible manner. To make progress in this
direction, we draw inspiration from the recent progress on learning-based
implicit representations for 3D object reconstruction. Specifically, we propose
an expressive representation for human grasp modelling that is efficient and
easy to integrate with deep neural networks. Our insight is that every point in
a three-dimensional space can be characterized by the signed distances to the
surface of the hand and the object, respectively. Consequently, the hand, the
object, and the contact area can be represented by implicit surfaces in a
common space, in which the proximity between the hand and the object can be
modelled explicitly. We name this 3D to 2D mapping as Grasping Field,
parameterize it with a deep neural network, and learn it from data. We
demonstrate that the proposed grasping field is an effective and expressive
representation for human grasp generation. Specifically, our generative model
is able to synthesize high-quality human grasps, given only on a 3D object
point cloud. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our generative model
compares favorably with a strong baseline and approaches the level of natural
human grasps. Our method improves the physical plausibility of the hand-object
contact reconstruction and achieves comparable performance for 3D hand
reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art methods.

stellar feedback, both self-gravitating star clusters and unbound stars
generally remain, which arise from the same underlying continuum of
substructured stellar density, ie. the hierarchical cluster formation scenario.
The fraction of stars that are born within gravitationally-bound star clusters
is related to the overall cloud star formation efficiency set by stellar
feedback, but has significant scatter due to stochastic variations in the
small-scale details of the star-forming gas flow. We use our numerical results
to calibrate a model for mapping the bulk properties (mass, size, and
metallicity) of self-gravitating GMCs onto the star cluster populations they
form, expressed statistically in terms of cloud-level distributions.
Synthesizing cluster catalogues from an observed GMC catalogue in M83, we find
that this model predicts initial star cluster masses and sizes that are in good
agreement with observations, using only standard IMF and stellar evolution

gravity to stellar feedback is the key parameter setting the masses of star

the scalability issues by, for instance, taking advantage of the symmetry of DC
topologies and the programmability of DC switches to compactly encode multicast
group information inside packets, thereby reducing the overhead resulting from
the need to store the states of flows at the network switches. However,
although these scale well with the number of multicast groups, they do not do
so with group sizes, and as a result, they yield substantial traffic control
overhead and network congestion. In this paper, we present Bert, a scalable,
source-initiated DC multicast routing approach that scales well with both the
number and the size of multicast groups, and does so through clustering, by
dividing the members of the multicast group into a set of clusters with each
cluster employing its own forwarding rules. Compared to the state-of-the-art

reducing the packet header sizes and the number of extra packet transmissions,

By leveraging a dynamic phase modulation, the proposed linear phased array is

involves occlusions and partial views. Given object models, one approach is to
perform object pose estimation and use the most likely candidate pose per
object to pick the target without collisions. This approach, however, ignores
the uncertainty of the perception process both regarding the target's and the
surrounding objects' poses. This work proposes first a perception process for
6D pose estimation, which returns a discrete distribution of object poses in a
scene. Then, an open-loop planning pipeline is proposed to return safe and
effective solutions for moving a robotic arm to pick, which (a) minimizes the
probability of collision with the obstructing objects; and (b) maximizes the
probability of reaching the target item. The planning framework models the
challenge as a stochastic variant of the Minimum Constraint Removal (MCR)
problem. The effectiveness of the methodology is verified given both simulated
and real data in different scenarios. The experiments demonstrate the
importance of considering the uncertainty of the perception process in terms of
safe execution. The results also show that the methodology is more effective
than conservative MCR approaches, which avoid all possible object poses
regardless of the reported uncertainty.

multitude of projects. This growing interest is due to the fact that Docker
technology supports a convenient process for creating and building containers,
promoting close cooperation between developer and operations teams, and
enabling continuous software delivery. As a fast-growing technology, it is
important to identify the Docker-related topics that are most popular as well
as existing challenges and difficulties that developers face. This paper
presents a large-scale empirical study identifying practitioners' perspectives
on Docker technology by mining posts from the Stack Overflow (SoF) community.
Method: A dataset of 113,922 Docker-related posts was created based on a set of
relevant tags and contents. The dataset was cleaned and prepared. Topic
modelling was conducted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), allowing the
identification of dominant topics in the domain. Our results show that most
developers use SoF to ask about a broad spectrum of Docker topics including
framework development, application deployment, continuous integration,
web-server configuration and many more. We determined that 30 topics that
developers discuss can be grouped into 13 main categories. Most of the posts
belong to categories of application development, configuration, and networking.
On the other hand, we find that the posts on monitoring status, transferring
data, and authenticating users are more popular among developers compared to
the other topics. Specifically, developers face challenges in web browser
issues, networking error and memory management. Besides, there is a lack of
experts in this domain. Our research findings will guide future work on the
development of new tools and techniques, helping the community to focus efforts
and understand existing trade-offs on Docker topics.

collect only the information necessary for a target machine learning task. In
this paper, we introduce key-nets, which are convolutional networks paired with
a custom vision sensor which applies an optical/analog transform such that the
key-net can perform exact encrypted inference on this transformed image, but
the image is not interpretable by a human or any other key-net. We provide five
sufficient conditions for an optical transformation suitable for a key-net, and
show that generalized stochastic matrices (e.g. scale, bias and fractional
pixel shuffling) satisfy these conditions. We motivate the key-net by showing
that without it there is a utility/privacy tradeoff for a network fine-tuned
directly on optically transformed images for face identification and object
detection. Finally, we show that a key-net is equivalent to homomorphic
encryption using a Hill cipher, with an upper bound on memory and runtime that
scales quadratically with a user specified privacy parameter. Therefore, the
key-net is the first practical, efficient and privacy preserving vision sensor

which presents spherical symmetry and a de Sitter type equation of state, where
the radial pressure $p_r$ is equal to the negative of energy density $\rho$,
$p_r=-\rho$. Then, two solutions for the Einstein equations are built, a
regular interior solution for the region with matter satisfying a de Sitter
equation of state, and an external solution for the region outside the matter,
that corresponds to the Reissner-Nordstr\""om metric. To complete the solution
we apply the Darmois-Israel junction conditions with a timelike thin shell at
the matching surface. It is assumed that the matching surface is composed by a
thin shell of matter, i.e., a surface layer in the form a perfect fluid obeying

online atomicity checkers incur either false positives or false negatives in
detecting transactions experiencing transactional atomicity violations. This
paper proposes RegionTrack. RegionTrack tracks cross-thread dependences at the
event, dynamic subregion, and transaction levels. It maintains both dynamic
subregions within selected transactions and transactional happens-before
relations through its novel timestamp propagation approach. We prove that
RegionTrack is sound and complete in detecting both transactional atomicity
violations and non-serializable traces. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first online technique that precisely captures the transitively closed set of
happens-before relations over all conflicting events with respect to every

RegionTrack on 19 subjects of the DaCapo and the Java Grande Forum benchmarks.

promise for extraction of useful work from its seemingly chaotic
out-of-equilibrium dynamics. Streamlining active matter to produce work is
especially important at microscale, where the viscous forces prevail over
inertia and the useful modes of transport require very specific non-reciprocal
type of motion. Here we report that microscopic active droplets representing
aqueous dispersions of swimming bacteria Bacillus subtilis show unidirectional
propulsion when placed in an inactive nematic medium. Random motion of bacteria
inside the droplet is rectified into a directional self-locomotion of the
droplet by the polar director structure that the droplet itself creates in the
surrounding nematic through anisotropic molecular interactions at its surface.
Droplets without swimming bacteria show no net displacement. The trajectory of
the active droplet can be predesigned as rectilinear or curvilinear by
patterning the molecular orientation of the nematic medium. The effect
demonstrates that swimming at microscale can be achieved at the expense of
broken spatial symmetry of the medium; it can be used in development of
micromachines.

the use of high-intensity ultrasound that controls the process of
solidification during AM of 316L stainless steel. We find that the use of
ultrasound favours the columnar-to-equiaxed transition, promoting the formation
of fine equiaxed grains with random crystallographic texture. Moreover, the use
of ultrasound increases the number density of grains from 305 mm-2 to 2748 mm-2
despite an associated decrease in cooling rate and temperature gradient in the
melt pool during AM. Our assessment of the relationship between grain size and
cooling rate indicates that the formation of crystallites during AM is enhanced
by ultrasound. Furthermore, the use of ultrasound increases the amount of
constitutional supercooling during solidification by lowering the temperature
gradient in the bulk of the melt pool, thus creating an environment that
favours nucleation, growth, and survival of grains. This new understanding
provides opportunities to better exploit ultrasound to control grain structure
in AM-fabricated metal products.

the traditional model fails to explain experimentally observed dependence of

Planning CT and structure datasets for 120 patients with intact prostate cancer
were retrospectively selected and divided for 10-fold cross-validation. The
proposed adversarial multi-residual multi-scale pooling Markov Random Field
(MRF) enhanced network (ARPM-net) implements an adversarial training scheme. A
segmentation network and a discriminator network were trained jointly, and only
the segmentation network was used for prediction. The segmentation network
integrates a newly designed MRF block into a variation of multi-residual U-net.
The discriminator takes the product of the original CT and the
prediction/ground-truth as input and classifies the input into fake/real. The
segmentation network and discriminator network can be trained jointly as a
whole, or the discriminator can be used for fine-tuning after the segmentation
network is coarsely trained. Multi-scale pooling layers were introduced to
preserve spatial resolution during pooling using less memory compared to atrous
convolution layers. An adaptive loss function was proposed to enhance the
training on small or low contrast organs. The accuracy of modeled contours was
measured with the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Average Hausdorff Distance
(AHD), Average Surface Hausdorff Distance (ASHD), and relative Volume
Difference (VD) using clinical contours as references to the ground-truth. The
proposed ARPM-net method was compared to several stateof-the-art deep learning

``searchers'' moving through a complex network. For example, intracellular
cargo is transported on tubular networks, news and rumors spread through online
social networks, and the rapid global spread of infectious diseases occurs
through passengers traveling on the airport network. To understand the
timescale of search/transport/spread, one commonly studies the first passage
time (FPT) of a single searcher (or ``spreader'') to a target. However, in many
scenarios the relevant timescale is not the FPT of a single searcher to a
target, but rather the FPT of the fastest searcher to a target out of many
searchers. For example, many processes in cell biology are triggered by the
first molecule to find a target out of many, and the time it takes an
infectious disease to reach a particular city depends on the first infected
traveler to arrive out of potentially many infected travelers. Such fastest
FPTs are called extreme FPTs. In this paper, we study extreme FPTs for a
general class of continuous-time random walks on networks (which includes
continuous-time Markov chains). In the limit of many searchers, we find
explicit formulas for the probability distribution and all the moments of the
$k$th fastest FPT. These rigorous formulas depend only on network parameters
along a certain geodesic path(s) from the starting location to the target since
the fastest searchers take a direct route to the target. Furthermore, our
results allow one to estimate if a particular system is in a regime
characterized by fast extreme FPTs. We also prove similar results for mortal
searchers on a network that are conditioned to find the target before a fast
inactivation time. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations and
uncover potential pitfalls of modeling diffusive or subdiffusive processes

analyzed for gapless and gapped single and double barriers. We find that in the
energy range where Fano resonances occur, the Seebeck coefficient attains
values of tens of mV/K and the power factor reaches values of the order nW/K.
Hybrid resonances also sustain high values for the thermoelectric properties,
however not as high as Fano resonances. We also find that despite the Fano and
hybrid profiles are manifested in the conductance of gapped barrier structures,
the Seebeck coefficient and the power factor are systematically reduced as the
bandgap gets larger. So, our findings indicate that bilayer graphene barrier

version have been widely used in machine learning. In the iterations of ADMM,
model updates using local private data and model exchanges among agents impose
critical privacy concerns. Despite some pioneering works to relieve such
concerns, differentially private ADMM still confronts many research challenges.
For example, the guarantee of differential privacy (DP) relies on the premise
that the optimality of each local problem can be perfectly attained in each
ADMM iteration, which may never happen in practice. The model trained by DP
ADMM may have low prediction accuracy. In this paper, we address these concerns
by proposing a novel (Improved) Plausible differentially Private ADMM
algorithm, called PP-ADMM and IPP-ADMM. In PP-ADMM, each agent approximately
solves a perturbed optimization problem that is formulated from its local
private data in an iteration, and then perturbs the approximate solution with
Gaussian noise to provide the DP guarantee. To further improve the model
accuracy and convergence, an improved version IPP-ADMM adopts sparse vector
technique (SVT) to determine if an agent should update its neighbors with the
current perturbed solution. The agent calculates the difference of the current
solution from that in the last iteration, and if the difference is larger than
a threshold, it passes the solution to neighbors; or otherwise the solution
will be discarded. Moreover, we propose to track the total privacy loss under
the zero-concentrated DP (zCDP) and provide a generalization performance
analysis. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that under the same
privacy guarantee, the proposed algorithms are superior to the state of the art
in terms of model accuracy and convergence rate.

certain topic according to the given photo stream. The existing studies focus
on designing complex models, which rely on a huge amount of human-annotated
data. However, the annotation of VIST is extremely costly and many topics
cannot be covered in the training dataset due to the long-tail topic
distribution. In this paper, we focus on enhancing the generalization ability
of the VIST model by considering the few-shot setting. Inspired by the way
humans tell a story, we propose a topic adaptive storyteller to model the
ability of inter-topic generalization. In practice, we apply the gradient-based
meta-learning algorithm on multi-modal seq2seq models to endow the model the
ability to adapt quickly from topic to topic. Besides, We further propose a
prototype encoding structure to model the ability of intra-topic derivation.
Specifically, we encode and restore the few training story text to serve as a
reference to guide the generation at inference time. Experimental results show
that topic adaptation and prototype encoding structure mutually bring benefit
to the few-shot model on BLEU and METEOR metric. The further case study shows
that the stories generated after few-shot adaptation are more relative and
expressive.

conductivity is taken into account for the plasma through Ohm law; however, the
shear viscous stress is neglected, as well as the self-gravity of the disk. In
order to solve the integrated equations that govern the dynamical behaviour of
the magneto-fluid, we have used a self-similar solution. We introduce two
dimensionless variables, $S_0$ and $\epsilon_\rho$, which show the magnitude of
electrical conductivity and the density behaviour with time, respectively. The
effect of each of these on the structure of the disk is studied. While the
pressure is obtained simply by solving an ordinary differential equation, the

any pair of languages, given a corpus of paired translated documents for
\emph{a small subset} of all pairs of languages. Despite impressive empirical
results and an increasing interest in massively multilingual models,
theoretical analysis on translation errors made by such universal machine
translation models is only nascent. In this paper, we formally prove certain
impossibilities of this endeavour in general, as well as prove positive results
in the presence of additional (but natural) structure of data.
  For the former, we derive a lower bound on the translation error in the
many-to-many translation setting, which shows that any algorithm aiming to
learn shared sentence representations among multiple language pairs has to make
a large translation error on at least one of the translation tasks, if no
assumption on the structure of the languages is made. For the latter, we show
that if the paired documents in the corpus follow a natural
\emph{encoder-decoder} generative process, we can expect a natural notion of
``generalization'': a linear number of language pairs, rather than quadratic,
suffices to learn a good representation. Our theory also explains what kinds of
connection graphs between pairs of languages are better suited: ones with
longer paths result in worse sample complexity in terms of the total number of
documents per language pair needed. We believe our theoretical insights and
implications contribute to the future algorithmic design of universal machine
translation.

magnetic perturbation (RMP) in a tokamak has been rigorously developed in the
resistive-inertial (RI) and viscous-resistive (VR) regimes purely from the
two-field reduced MHD model. Models for plasma response to RMP are commonly
composed of equations for the resonant magnetic field response (i.e. the
magnetic island) and the torque balance of plasma flow. However, in previous
plasma response models, the magnetic island and the torque balance equations
are often derived separately from reduced MHD and full MHD equations,
respectively. By contrast, in this work we derive both the magnetic island
response and the torque balance equations in a quasi-linear model for plasma
flow response entirely from a set of two-field reduced MHD equations. Such a
quasi-linear model can recover previous plasma flow response models within
certain limits and approximations. Furthermore, the physical origins of
quasi-linear forces and moments in the flow response equation are also
accurately calculated and clarified self-consistently.

conditions is an environmentally benign and energy-efficient process that
produces a green oxidizer. Despite its industrial importance, the reaction
mechanism of HPDS is still controversial, even for the prototypical catalyst
Pd. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a comprehensive
consideration of entropic and solvation effects reveal that the conventionally
accepted Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism fails to explain why H2O2 production
dominates over H2O production, which was experimentally reported. Inspired by
the recently suggested heterolytic mechanism that involves electron and proton
transfer at Pd catalysts, we propose a new electrochemical DFT model that is
applicable for nonelectrochemical systems where a protonation intrinsically
occurs. Our model is based on combining the Butler-Volmer equation and constant
potential DFT with hybrid explicit-implicit solvent treatments. Application of
this model to Pd(111) surfaces produces accurate descriptions of the activation
barriers of both H2O2 and H2O production (within only ~0.1 eV of experimentally
measured values). The heterolytic mechanism has a lower barrier for the
protonation steps for H2O2 production than the nonelectrochemical hydrogenation
steps, leading to advantageous kinetics for H2O2 production over H2O
production. This work is the first theoretical and computational study
supporting the heterolytic H2O2 production mechanism, and it resolves the
unanswered discrepancies between previous experimental and DFT results. We
expect that these results will readily help the systematic development of
improved catalysts for H2O2 synthesis.

slowly compared to the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and Hermitian qubits.

eruptions in 12 hours from a large bipolar active region (AR) observed by SDO,
STEREO, RHESSI, and GOES. Evidently, the AR initially had a triple-decker
configuration: three flux ropes in a vertical stack above the polarity
inversion line (PIL). Upon being bumped by a confined eruption of the middle
flux rope, the top flux rope erupts to make the first CME and its accompanying
AR-spanning flare arcade rooted in a far-apart pair of flare ribbons. The
second CME is made by eruption of the previously-arrested middle flux rope,
which blows open the flare arcade of the first CME and produces a flare arcade
rooted in a pair of flare ribbons closer to the PIL than those of the first
CME. The third CME is made by blowout eruption of the bottom flux rope, which
blows open the second flare arcade and makes its own flare arcade and pair of
flare ribbons. Flux cancellation observed at the PIL likely triggers the
initial confined eruption of the middle flux rope. That confined eruption
evidently triggers the first CME eruption. The lid-removal mechanism instigated
by the first CME eruption plausibly triggers the second CME eruption. Further
lid removal by the second CME eruption plausibly triggers the final CME
eruption.

this challenge, we propose a novel SAFRON (Stitching Across the FRONtiers)

realistic image tiles of arbitrarily large size after training it on relatively

to other existing approaches, our framework is efficient in terms of the memory

verification systems use a generative model based on probabilistic linear
discriminant analysis (PLDA) for computing the verification score. Recently, we
had proposed a neural network approach for backend modeling in speaker
verification called the neural PLDA (NPLDA) where the likelihood ratio score of
the generative PLDA model is posed as a discriminative similarity function and
the learnable parameters of the score function are optimized using a
verification cost. In this paper, we extend this work to achieve joint
optimization of the embedding neural network (x-vector network) with the NPLDA
network in an end-to-end (E2E) fashion. This proposed end-to-end model is
optimized directly from the acoustic features with a verification cost function
and during testing, the model directly outputs the likelihood ratio score. With
various experiments using the NIST speaker recognition evaluation (SRE) 2018

shadow is a high probability event, which can affect the quality of subsequent
processing and limit the scenarios of application. Hence, removing the thick
cloud and cloud shadow as well as recovering the cloud-contaminated pixels is
indispensable to make good use of remote sensing images. In this paper, a novel
thick cloud removal method for remote sensing images based on temporal
smoothness and sparsity-regularized tensor optimization (TSSTO) is proposed.
The basic idea of TSSTO is that the thick cloud and cloud shadow are not only
sparse but also smooth along the horizontal and vertical direction in images
while the clean images are smooth along the temporal direction between images.
Therefore, the sparsity norm is used to boost the sparsity of the cloud and
cloud shadow, and unidirectional total variation (UTV) regularizers are applied
to ensure the unidirectional smoothness. This paper utilizes alternation
direction method of multipliers to solve the presented model and generate the
cloud and cloud shadow element as well as the clean element. The cloud and
cloud shadow element is purified to get the cloud area and cloud shadow area.
Then, the clean area of the original cloud-contaminated images is replaced to
the corresponding area of the clean element. Finally, the reference image is
selected to reconstruct details of the cloud area and cloud shadow area using
the information cloning method. A series of experiments are conducted both on
simulated and real cloud-contaminated images from different sensors and with
different resolutions, and the results demonstrate the potential of the
proposed TSSTO method for removing cloud and cloud shadow from both qualitative
and quantitative viewpoints.

who has had COVID; and, 2) ensure those that have been exposed to the virus do
not unknowingly infect others. ""COVI"" is the name of a recent contact tracing

informed decisions about their movement and allow for a data-driven approach to
public health policy; all the while ensuring data is safeguarded from
governments, companies, and individuals. This article will provide a critical

scenarios. In an arbitrary bounded 3-D domain, the existence, linear stability,
and slow dynamics of localized multi-spot patterns is analyzed for the
well-known singularly perturbed Gierer-Meinhardt (GM) activator-inhibitor
system in the limit of a small activator diffusivity $\varepsilon^2\ll 1$. Our
main focus is to classify the different types of multi-spot patterns, and
predict their linear stability properties, for different asymptotic ranges of
the inhibitor diffusivity $D$. For the range $D={\mathcal
O}(\varepsilon^{-1})\gg 1$, although both symmetric and asymmetric
quasi-equilibrium spot patterns can be constructed, the asymmetric patterns are
shown to be always unstable. On this range of $D$, it is shown that symmetric
spot patterns can undergo either competition instabilities or a Hopf
bifurcation, leading to spot annihilation or temporal spot amplitude
oscillations, respectively. For $D={\mathcal O}(1)$, only symmetric spot
quasi-equilibria exist and they are linearly stable on ${\mathcal O}(1)$ time
intervals. On this range, it is shown that the spot locations evolve slowly on
an ${\mathcal O}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ time scale towards their equilibrium
locations according to an ODE gradient flow, which is determined by a discrete
energy involving the reduced-wave Green's function. The central role of the
far-field behavior of a certain core problem, which characterizes the profile
of a localized spot, for the construction of quasi-equilibria in the

showed promising results for simulated speech mixtures consisting of various

application of the model. In this paper, we extend the prior work by addressing
the case where no speaker profile is available. Specifically, we perform
speaker counting and clustering by using the internal speaker representations
of the E2E SA-ASR model to diarize the utterances of the speakers whose

graph completion. It also serves as a fundamental step towards multi-hop
reasoning over learned knowledge. Previously, several rotation-based
translational methods have been developed to model composite relations using
the product of a series of complex-valued diagonal matrices. However, these
methods tend to make several oversimplified assumptions on the composite
relations, e.g., forcing them to be commutative, independent from entities and
lacking semantic hierarchy. To systematically tackle these problems, we have
developed a novel knowledge graph embedding method, named DensE, to provide an
improved modeling scheme for the complex composition patterns of relations. In
particular, our method decomposes each relation into an SO(3) group-based
rotation operator and a scaling operator in the three dimensional (3-D)
Euclidean space. This design principle leads to several advantages of our
method: (1) For composite relations, the corresponding diagonal relation
matrices can be non-commutative, reflecting a predominant scenario in real
world applications; (2) Our model preserves the natural interaction between
relational operations and entity embeddings; (3) The scaling operation provides
the modeling power for the intrinsic semantic hierarchical structure of
entities; (4) The enhanced expressiveness of DensE is achieved with high
computational efficiency in terms of both parameter size and training time; and
(5) Modeling entities in Euclidean space instead of quaternion space keeps the
direct geometrical interpretations of relational patterns. Experimental results
on multiple benchmark knowledge graphs show that DensE outperforms the current
state-of-the-art models for missing link prediction, especially on composite
relations.

development of novel verification methods and the speed-up of supporting
technologies like SMT solving. To keep software verification tools up to date
with these advances, tool developers keep on integrating newly designed methods
into their tools, almost exclusively by re-implementing the method within their
own framework. While this allows for a conceptual re-use of methods, it
requires novel implementations for every new technique.
  In this paper, we employ cooperative verification in order to avoid
reimplementation and enable usage of novel tools as black-box components in

software verification which is invariant generation. Finding an adequate loop
invariant is key to the success of a verification run. Our framework named
CoVerCIG allows a master verification tool to delegate the task of invariant
generation to one or several specialized helper invariant generators. Their
results are then utilized within the verification run of the master verifier,
allowing in particular for crosschecking the validity of the invariant. We
experimentally evaluate our framework on an instance with two masters and three
different invariant generators using a number of benchmarks from SV-COMP 2020.

low-rank approximation and kernel methods.
  Low-rank approximation is very important in numerical linear algebra. Many
applications depend on matrix decomposition algorithms that provide accurate
low-rank representations of data. In modern problems, however, various factors
make this hard to accomplish. One solution to these problems is the use of
random projections. Instead of directly computing the matrix factorization, we
randomly project the matrix onto a lower-dimensional subspace and then compute
the factorization. Often, we are able to do this without significant loss of
accuracy. We describe how randomization can be used to create more efficient
algorithms to perform low-rank matrix approximation, as well as introducing a
novel randomized algorithm for matrix decomposition. Compared to standard
approaches, random algorithms are often faster and more robust. With these
randomized algorithms, analyzing massive data sets becomes tractable.
  Kernel methods are almost diametrically opposite from low-rank approximation.
The idea is to project low-dimensional data into a higher-dimensional 'feature
space,' such that it is linear separable in the feature space. This enables the
model to learn a nonlinear separation of the data. As before, with large data
matrices, computing the kernel matrix can be expensive, so we use randomized
methods to approximate the matrix. In addition, we propose an extension of the
random Fourier features kernel in which hyperparameter values are randomly
sampled from an interval or Borel set.

Previous studies on cross-lingual voice conversion mainly focus on spectral
conversion with a linear transformation for F0 transfer. However, as an
important prosodic factor, F0 is inherently hierarchical, thus it is
insufficient to just use a linear method for conversion. We propose the use of
continuous wavelet transform (CWT) decomposition for F0 modeling. CWT provides
a way to decompose a signal into different temporal scales that explain prosody

ranging from 43 to $>$500 K with an unweighted average of $\sim$170 K. There is
no evidence for internal sources playing an important role in the heating of
the various structures identified in previous work, namely the elongated ridge,
the northwestern clump, and the eastern region of the compact ridge, while the
high temperatures in the western region of the compact ridge may be dominated
by internal massive star formation. Significant gradients of kinetic
temperature along molecular filaments traced by H$_2$CS indicate that the dense
gas is heated by the shocks induced by the enigmatic explosive event, which
occurred several hundred years ago greatly affecting the energetics of the
Orion KL region. Thus, with the notable exception of the western region of the
compact ridge, the high temperatures of the dense gas in Orion KL are probably
caused by shocks from the explosive event, leading to a dominant component of
externally heated dense gas.

non-proximable mixed norm minimization. Mixed norm regularization methods play
a central role in signal reconstruction and processing, where their
optimization relies on the fact that the proximity operators of the mixed norms
can be computed efficiently. To bring out the power of regularization,
sophisticated layered modeling of mixed norms that can capture inherent signal
structure is a key ingredient, but the proximity operator of such a mixed norm
is often unavailable (non-proximable). Our ERx decouples a layered
non-proximable mixed norm into a norm and multiple epigraphical constraints.
This enables us to handle a wide range of non-proximable mixed norms in
optimization, as long as both the proximal operator of the outermost norm and
the projection onto each epigraphical constraint are efficiently computable.
Moreover, under mild conditions, we prove that ERx does not change the
minimizer of the original problem despite relaxing equality constraints into
inequality ones. We also develop new regularizers based on ERx: one is
decorrelated structure-tensor total variation for color image restoration, and
the other is amplitude-spectrum nuclear norm for low-rank amplitude recovery.
We examine the power of these regularizers through experiments, which
illustrates the utility of ERx.

polytopes (IUP) in expanding piecewise affine mappings whose linear components
are isotropic scalings. The approach relies on using empirical information
embedded in trajectories in order to infer, and then to solve, a so-called
conditioning problem for some generating collection of polytopes. A
conditioning problem consists of a series of requirements on the polytopes'
localisation and on the dynamical transitions between these elements. The core
element of the approach is a reformulation of the problem as a set of piecewise
linear inequalities for some matrices which encapsulate geometric constraints.
In that way, the original topological puzzle is converted into a standard
problem in computational geometry. This transformation involves an optimization
procedure that ensures that both problems are equivalent.
  As a proof of concept, the approach is applied to the study of the loss of
ergodicity in basic examples of globally coupled maps. The study explains,
completes and substantially extends previous achievements about asymmetric IUP
in these systems. Comparison with the numerics reveals sharp existence
conditions depending on the map parameters, and accurate fits of the empirical
ergodic components. In addition, this application also reveals unanticipated
features about conditioning problem solutions, especially as the dependence on
the set of admissible face directions is concerned.

Existing deep learning frameworks usually concentrate on optimizing training
speed and pay fewer attentions to inference-specific optimizations. Actually,
model inference differs from training in terms of computation, e.g. parameters
are refreshed each gradient update step during training, but kept invariant
during inference. These special characteristics of model inference open new
opportunities for its optimization. In this paper, we propose a hardware-aware
optimization framework, namely Woodpecker-DL (WPK), to accelerate inference by
taking advantage of multiple joint optimizations from the perspectives of graph
optimization, automated searches, domain-specific language (DSL) compiler
techniques and system-level exploration. In WPK, we investigated two new
automated search approaches based on genetic algorithm and reinforcement
learning, respectively, to hunt the best operator code configurations targeting
specific hardware. A customized DSL compiler is further attached to these
search algorithms to generate efficient codes. To create an optimized inference
plan, WPK systematically explores high-speed operator implementations from
third-party libraries besides our automatically generated codes and singles out
the best implementation per operator for use. Extensive experiments
demonstrated that on a Tesla P100 GPU, we can achieve the maximum speedup of
5.40 over cuDNN and 1.63 over TVM on individual convolution operators, and run
up to 1.18 times faster than TensorRT for end-to-end model inference.

mechanism remains obscure to the research community. In this paper, we perform
an in-depth investigation and observe that the efficacy of pseudo-LiDAR
representation comes from the coordinate transformation, instead of data
representation itself. Based on this observation, we design an image based CNN
detector named Patch-Net, which is more generalized and can be instantiated as
pseudo-LiDAR based 3D detectors. Moreover, the pseudo-LiDAR data in our
PatchNet is organized as the image representation, which means existing 2D CNN
designs can be easily utilized for extracting deep features from input data and
boosting 3D detection performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the
challenging KITTI dataset, where the proposed PatchNet outperforms all existing
pseudo-LiDAR based counterparts. Code has been made available at:

has received considerable attention in multimedia and computer vision community

by only modeling the inter-frame inconsistency, leaving potential high risks
for DeepFake attackers. In this paper, we introduce a new problem of partial
face attack in DeepFake video, where only video-level labels are provided but
not all the faces in the fake videos are manipulated. We address this problem
by multiple instance learning framework, treating faces and input video as
instances and bag respectively. A sharp MIL (S-MIL) is proposed which builds
direct mapping from instance embeddings to bag prediction, rather than from
instance embeddings to instance prediction and then to bag prediction in
traditional MIL. Theoretical analysis proves that the gradient vanishing in
traditional MIL is relieved in S-MIL. To generate instances that can accurately
incorporate the partially manipulated faces, spatial-temporal encoded instance
is designed to fully model the intra-frame and inter-frame inconsistency, which
further helps to promote the detection performance. We also construct a new
dataset FFPMS for partially attacked DeepFake video detection, which can
benefit the evaluation of different methods at both frame and video levels.
Experiments on FFPMS and the widely used DFDC dataset verify that S-MIL is
superior to other counterparts for partially attacked DeepFake video detection.
In addition, S-MIL can also be adapted to traditional DeepFake image detection
tasks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on single-frame datasets.

Feshbach resonances in cold-atom systems. We analyze the onset of itinerant
ferromagnetism, pinpointing the critical attraction strength where partially

the nucleation of a fully imbalanced band-insulating domain hosting the

strength, therefore increasing the (opposite) imbalance of the other domain,
until the two spin components are fully separated. In the presence of a
harmonic trap, the ferromagnetic state hosts a partially imbalanced domain in
the center with an excess of the attractive component and filling lower than
one. This central region is surrounded by fully imbalanced domains, located in
the trap tails, hosting only fermions belonging to the other component.

Model-based Quality-Diversity search (M-QD), the network is trained

pair of permutations P and T whether the pattern P is contained in the text T.
Bose, Buss and Lubiw showed that PPM is NP-complete. In view of this result, it
is natural to ask how the situation changes when we restrict the pattern P to a
fixed permutation class C; this is known as the C-Pattern PPM problem.
  Grid classes are special kind of permutation classes, consisting of
permutations admitting a grid-like decomposition into simpler building blocks.
Of particular interest are the so-called monotone grid classes, in which each
building block is a monotone sequence. Recently, it has been discovered that
grid classes, especially the monotone ones, play a fundamental role in the
understanding of the structure of general permutation classes. This motivates
us to study the hardness of C-Pattern PPM for a (monotone) grid class C.
  We provide a complexity dichotomy for C-Pattern PPM when C is taken to be a
monotone grid class. Specifically, we show that the problem is polynomial-time
solvable if a certain graph associated with C, called the cell graph, is a
forest, and it is NP-complete otherwise. We further generalize our results to
grid classes whose blocks belong to classes of bounded grid-width. We show that
the C-Pattern PPM for such a grid class C is polynomial-time solvable if the
cell graph of C avoids a cycle or a certain special type of path, and it is
NP-complete otherwise.

neural networks, which rapidly segments 3D volumes into 27 anatomical

performance on various contrasts of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
computed tomography (CT) scans. Methods: Deep convolutional neural networks are
trained to segment 3D MRI (MPRAGE, DWI, FLAIR) and CT scans. A large database
of in total 851 MRI/CT scans is used for neural network training. Training
labels are obtained on the MPRAGE contrast and coregistered to the other
imaging modalities. The segmentation quality is quantified using the Dice
metric for a total of 27 anatomical structures. Dropout sampling is implemented
to identify corrupted input scans or low-quality segmentations. Full
segmentation of 3D volumes with more than 2 million voxels is obtained in less
than 1s of processing time on a graphical processing unit. Results: The best
average Dice score is found on $T_1$-weighted MPRAGE ($85.3\pm4.6\,\%$).
However, for FLAIR ($80.0\pm7.1\,\%$), DWI ($78.2\pm7.9\,\%$) and CT ($79.1\pm
7.9\,\%$), good-quality segmentation is feasible for most anatomical
structures. Corrupted input volumes or low-quality segmentations can be
detected using dropout sampling. Conclusion: The flexibility and performance of
deep convolutional neural networks enables the direct, real-time segmentation

physical systems. In the presence of uncertainty, accurate prediction of the
behavior of these systems using the models requires understanding the effect of
uncertainty in the response. In uncertainty quantification, statistics such as
mean and variance of the response of these physical systems are sought. To
estimate these statistics sampling-based methods like Monte Carlo often require
many evaluations of the models' governing equations for multiple realizations
of the uncertainty. However, for large complex engineering systems, these
methods become computationally burdensome. In structural engineering, often an
otherwise linear structure contains spatially local nonlinearities with
uncertainty present in them. A standard nonlinear solver for them with
sampling-based methods for uncertainty quantification incurs significant
computational cost for estimating the statistics of the response. To ease this
computational burden of uncertainty quantification of large-scale locally
nonlinear dynamical systems, a method is proposed herein, which decomposes the
response into two parts -- response of a nominal linear system and a corrective
term. This corrective term is the response from a pseudoforce that contains the
nonlinearity and uncertainty information. In this paper, neural network, a
recently popular tool for universal function approximation in the scientific
machine learning community due to the advancement of computational capability
as well as the availability of open-sourced packages like PyTorch and
TensorFlow is used to estimate the pseudoforce. Since only the nonlinear and
uncertain pseudoforce is modeled using the neural networks the same network can
be used to predict a different response of the system and hence no new network
is required to train if the statistic of a different response is sought.

matter and dense plasmas. Important occurrences of WDM include dense
astrophysical objects, matter in the core of our Earth, as well as matter
produced in strong compression experiments. As of late, x-ray Thomson
scattering has become an advanced tool to diagnose WDM. The interpretation of
the data requires model input for the dynamic structure factor $S(q,\omega)$
and the plasmon dispersion $\omega(q)$. Recently the first \textit{ab initio}
results for $S(q,\omega)$ of the homogeneous warm dense electron gas were
obtained from path integral Monte Carlo simulations, [Dornheim \textit{et al.},
Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{121}, 255001 (2018)]. Here, we analyse the effects of
correlations and finite temperature on the dynamic dielectric function and the
plasmon dispersion. Our results for the plasmon dispersion and damping differ
significantly from the random phase approximation and from earlier models of
the correlated electron gas. Moreover, we show when commonly used weak damping
approximations break down and how the method of complex zeros of the dielectric
function can solve this problem for WDM conditions.

consequences on the estimate of the Hubble constant (H$_0$). We aim at
investigating the dependence on metal abundance ([Fe/H]) of the PL/PW relations

spectroscopic data, gathering a total sample of 413 Galactic DCEPs (372
fundamental mode -- DCEP\_F and 41 first overtone -- DCEP\_1O) and constructed
new metallicity-dependent PL/PW relations in the near infra-red (NIR) adopting
the Astrometric Based Luminosity. We find indications that the slopes of the
PL$(K_S)$ and PW$(J,K_S)$ relations for Galactic DCEPs might depend on
metallicity when compared to the Large Magellanic Cloud relationships.
Therefore, we have used a generalized form of the PL/PW relations to
simultaneously take into account the metallicity dependence of the slope and
intercept of these relations. We calculated PL/PW relations which, for the
first time, explicitly include a metallicity dependence of both the slope and
intercept terms. Although the insufficient quality of the available data makes

S=1 and 2, maintained by a confining harmonic-oscillator potential. The system
can be implemented in BEC and optics. By means of the Thomas-Fermi

when the cross-component repulsion is stronger that the self-repulsion in each

which gives rise to states featuring broken symmetry in an inner area, and
intact symmetry in a surrounding layer. Unlike stable GSs and vortices with
S=1, the states with S=2 are unstable against splitting. We also address SSB
for 1D gap solitons in the system including a lattice potential. In this case,
SSB takes place under the opposite condition, i.e., the cross-component

algorithm, HoldOut SGD, for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization.
HoldOut SGD uses the well known machine learning technique of holdout
estimation, in a distributed fashion, in order to select parameter updates that
are likely to lead to models with low loss values. This makes it more effective
at discarding Byzantine workers inputs than existing methods that eliminate
outliers in the parameter-space of the learned model. HoldOut SGD first
randomly selects a set of workers that use their private data in order to
propose gradient updates. Next, a voting committee of workers is randomly
selected, and each voter uses its private data as holdout data, in order to
select the best proposals via a voting scheme. We propose two possible
mechanisms for the coordination of workers in the distributed computation of
HoldOut SGD. The first uses a truthful central server and corresponds to the
typical setting of current federated learning. The second is fully distributed
and requires no central server, paving the way to fully decentralized federated
learning. The fully distributed version implements HoldOut SGD via ideas from
the blockchain domain, and specifically the Algorand committee selection and
consensus processes. We provide formal guarantees for the HoldOut SGD process
in terms of its convergence to the optimal model, and its level of resilience
to the fraction of Byzantine workers. Empirical evaluation shows that HoldOut
SGD is Byzantine-resilient and efficiently converges to an effectual model for
deep-learning tasks, as long as the total number of participating workers is
large and the fraction of Byzantine workers is less than half (<1/3 for the

transition studies is whether one can connect the growing relaxation time to a
concomitantly growing length scale. In this paper, we go beyond the realm of
ordinary glass forming liquids and study the origin of a growing dynamical
length scale $\xi$ in a self propelled ""active"" glass former. This length scale
which is constructed using structural correlations agrees well with the average
size of the clusters of slow moving particles that are formed as the liquid
becomes spatially heterogeneous. We further report that the concomitantly
growing $\alpha$- relaxation time exhibits a simple scaling law, $\tau_\alpha
\sim \text{exp} (\xi \mu / T_{eff})$, with $\mu$ as an effective chemical
potential, $T_{eff}$ as the effective temperature, and $\xi \mu$ as the growing

that as long as the origin remains stable, it is surrounded by a ""resilience
gap"": there are no other fixed points within a radius r*>0 and the system is
therefore expected to be resilient to a typical initial displacement small in
comparison to r*. The radius r* is shown to vanish at the same threshold where
the origin loses local stability, revealing a mechanism by which systems close
to the tipping point become less resilient. We also find that beyond the
resilience radius the number of fixed points in a ball surrounding the original
point of equilibrium grows exponentially with N, making systems dynamics highly
sensitive to far enough displacements from the origin.

flow is found to be highly heterogeneous, consisting of convection channels
with strong flow strength and stagnant regions with low velocities. The
modifications of flow field due to porous structure have a significant
influence on the dynamics of fluid particles. Evaluation of the particle
displacement along the trajectory reveals the emergence of anomalous transport
for long times as $\phi$ is decreased, which is associated with the long-time

such as CPU, memory footprint, and disk access are used to measure and compare
them to each other. In order to measure the use of resources, each simulator
executes 20 times a robotic scenario composed by a NAO robot that must navigate

applications. A new spectrum of important applications is currently emerging
from quantum technology and especially from electrical circuits behaving
quantum mechanically. This circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has given
rise to unprecedented single-photon detectors and a quantum computer supreme to
the classical supercomputers in a certain task. Thermal sensors are appealing
in enhancing these devices since they are not plagued by quantum noise and are
smaller, simpler, and consume about six orders of magnitude less power than the
commonly used traveling-wave parametric amplifiers. However, despite great
progress in the speed and noise levels of thermal sensors, no bolometer to date
has proven fast and sensitive enough to provide advantages in cQED. Here, we
experimentally demonstrate a bolometer surpassing this threshold with a noise
equivalent power of $30\, \rm{zW}/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}$ on par with the current
record while providing two-orders of magnitude shorter thermal time constant of
500 ns. Importantly, both of these characteristic numbers have been measured
directly from the same device, which implies a faithful estimation of the
calorimetric energy resolution of a single 30-GHz photon. These improvements
stem from the utilization of a graphene monolayer as the active material with
extremely low specific heat. The minimum demonstrated time constant of 200 ns
falls greatly below the state-of-the-art dephasing times of roughly 100 {\mu}s
for superconducting qubits and meets the timescales of contemporary readout
schemes thus enabling the utilization of thermal detectors in cQED.

$n$) is balanced by the repulsive beyond-mean-field quantum fluctuations (i.e.,
$E_{\textrm{BMF}}\propto n^{2+\gamma}$). The parameter $\gamma>0$ typically
takes the value $1/2$ if we consider the Lee-Huang-Yang (LHY) energy

three-body interaction becomes dominant. Here, we theoretically investigate how
collective excitations of a three-dimensional quantum droplet are affected by
the parameter $\gamma$ and a weak harmonic trapping potential, both of which
could be tuned in experiments. We use both the approximate approach based on a
Gaussian variational ansatz and the exact numerical solution of the Bogoliubov

magnetic field is crucial for the acceleration and collimation of relativistic
jets of electrically charged particles on superhorizon length scales. In this
context, we further study the effect of a large-scale magnetic field on the
dynamics of charged particles near a rotating black hole. We consider a
scenario in which the initially neutral particles on regular geodesic orbits in
the equatorial plane are destabilized by a charging process (e.g., by
photoionization). Some charged particles are accelerated out of the equatorial
plane, and they follow jetlike trajectories with relativistic velocities. In
our previous paper, we investigated this scenario for the case of perfect
alignment of the magnetic field with the axis of rotation; i.e., the system was
considered axisymmetric. Here we relax this assumption and investigate
nonaxisymmetric systems in which the magnetic field is arbitrarily inclined
with respect to the black hole spin. We study the system numerically in order
to locate the zones of escaping trajectories and compute the maximum (terminal)
escape velocity. It appears that breaking the axial symmetry (even by small
inclination angles) substantially increases the fraction of escaping orbits and
allows the acceleration to ultrarelativistic velocities that were excluded in
the axisymmetric setup. The presence of transient chaotic dynamics in the
launching region of the relativistic outflow is confirmed with chaotic
indicators.

important role in data organization and storage. Its performance and efficiency
are directly related to the performance of software. Nowadays, we have many
general relational database systems that can be used in our projects, such as
SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle, etc. It is undeniable that in most cases, we can
easily use these database systems to complete our projects, but considering the
generality, the general database systems often can't play the ultimate speed
and fully adapt to our projects. In very few projects, we will need to design a
database system that fully adapt to our projects and have a high efficiency and
concurrency. Therefore, it is very important to consider a feasible solution of
designing a database system (We only consider the relational database system
here). Meanwhile, for a database system, SQL interpretation and execution
module is necessary. According to the theory of formal language and automata,
the realization of this module can be completed by automata. In our experiment,
we made the following contributions: 1) We designed a small relational
database, and used the database to complete a highly concurrent student course
selection system. 2) We design a general automaton module, which can complete
the operation from parsing to execution. The using of strategy model and event
driven design scheme is used and some improvement on general automata, for
example a memory like structure is added to automata to make it better to store
context. All these make the automata model can be used in a variety of
occasions, not only the parsing and execution of SQL statements.

interactions with its environment. These interactions dictate electronic and
optical processes at interfaces, and is especially relevant in the case of thin

charge transport and interfaces between multiple layers occur along the
thickness or vertical direction, and thus such electronic interactions are
crucial in determining the device properties. Here, we introduce a new in-situ
spectroscopic ellipsometry data analysis method called DART with the ability to
directly probe electronic coupling due to intermolecular interactions along the
thickness direction using vacuum-deposited organic semiconductor thin films as
a model system. The analysis, which does not require any model fitting, reveals
direct observations of electronic coupling between frontier orbitals under
optical excitations leading to delocalization of the corresponding electronic
wavefunctions with thickness or, equivalently, number of molecules away from
the interface in C60 and MeO-TPD deposited on an insulating substrate (SiO2).
Applying the same methodology for C60 deposited on phthalocyanine thin films,
the analyses shows strong, anomalous features - in comparison to C60 deposited
on SiO2 - of the electronic wavefunctions corresponding to specific excitation
energies in C60 and phthalocyanines. Translation of such interactions in terms
of dielectric constants reveals plasmonic type resonance absorptions resulting
from oscillations of the excited state wavefunctions between the two materials
across the interface. Finally, reproducibility, angstrom-level sensitivity and
simplicity of the method are highlighted showcasing its applicability for
studying electronic coupling between any vapor-deposited material systems where
real-time measurements during deposition are possible.

solve this problem both numerically and analytically. In the latter case we
consider the regime of small external electrostatic fields and small

rate computed with the two approaches, even when the approximate result is
pushed beyond its expected validity. The ionization rate is very sensitive to
small changes of the external electrostatic field, spanning many orders of
magnitude for small changes of the intensity of the external field. The
dependence of the ionization on the internuclear distance is also studied, as
this has a direct connection with experimental methods in molecular physics. It
is shown that for large distances the ionization rate saturates, which is a
direct consequence of the behavior of the energy eigenvalue with the
internuclear distance. The Stark shift is computed and from it we extract the
static polarizability of H$_{2}^{+}$ and compare our results with those found

mass X-ray binaries hosting a neutron star accreting from the stellar wind of a

pronounced variability in X-rays that has long been (at least partly) ascribed
to the presence of clumps in the stellar wind. We report here on the first set
of results of an on-going XMM-Newton observational program aimed at searching
for spectroscopic variability during the X-ray flares and outbursts of the
SFXTs. The goal of the paper is to present the observational program and show
that the obtained results are according to expectations, with a number of
flares (between one and four) generally observed per source and per observation
(20~ks-long, on average). We base our work on a systematic and uniform analysis
method optimized to consistently search for spectral signatures of a variable
absorption column density, as well as other parameters of the spectral
continuum. Our preliminary results show that the program is successful and the
outcomes of the analysis support previous findings that most of the X-ray
flares seem associated to the presence of a massive structure approaching and
getting accreted by the compact object. However, we cannot rule out that other
mechanisms are at work together with clumps to enhance the X-ray variability of
SFXTs. This is expected according to current theoretical models. The success of
these observations shows that our observational program can be a powerful
instrument to deepen our understanding of the X-ray variability in SFXTs.
Further observations will help us in achieving a statistically robust sample.
This is required to conduct, in the future, a systematic analysis on the whole
SFXT class with the ultimate goal of disentangling the role of different

labeling is time-consuming and labor expensive, resulting there is little
well-labeled dataset available for singing-voice detection (S-VD). Hence, we
propose a data augmentation method for S-VD by transfer learning. In this
study, clean speech clips with voice activity endpoints and separate
instrumental music clips are artificially added together to simulate polyphonic
vocals to train a vocal/non-vocal detector. Due to the different articulation
and phonation between speaking and singing, the vocal detector trained with the
artificial dataset does not match well with the polyphonic music which is
singing vocals together with the instrumental accompaniments. To reduce this
mismatch, transfer learning is used to transfer the knowledge learned from the
artificial speech-plus-music training set to a small but matched polyphonic
dataset, i.e., singing vocals with accompaniments. By transferring the related
knowledge to make up for the lack of well-labeled training data in S-VD, the
proposed data augmentation method by transfer learning can improve S-VD
performance with an F-score improvement from 89.5% to 93.2%.

theoretical nucleosynthesis yields and event rates of all chemical enrichment
sources. This enables us to predict the origin of elements as a function of
time and environment. In the solar neighborhood, we find that stars with
initial masses of M>30M_\odot can become failed supernovae if there is a
significant contribution from hypernovae (HNe) at M~20-50M_\odot. The
contribution to GCE from super asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (with
M~8-10M_\odot at solar metallicity) is negligible, unless hybrid white dwarfs
from low-mass super-AGB stars explode as so-called Type Iax supernovae, or
high-mass super-AGB stars explode as electron-capture supernovae (ECSNe). Among
neutron-capture elements, the observed abundances of the second (Ba) and third
(Pb) peak elements are well reproduced with our updated yields of the slow
neutron-capture process (s-process) from AGB stars. The first peak elements,
Sr, Y, and Zr, are sufficiently produced by ECSNe together with AGB stars.
Neutron star mergers can produce rapid neutron-capture process (r-process)
elements up to Th and U, but the timescales are too long to explain
observations at low metallicities. The observed evolutionary trends, such as
for Eu, can well be explained if ~3% of 25-50 M_\odot hypernovae are
magneto-rotational supernovae producing r-process elements. Along with the
solar neighborhood, we also predict the evolutionary trends in the halo, bulge,

train discriminative or generative models with in-class data, then utilize the
pre-trained models to classify test data directly. However, these methods
always suffer from embedding confusion problem, i.e., partial out-of-class
instances are mixed with in-class ones of similar semantics, making it
difficult to classify. To solve this problem, we unify semi-supervised learning
to develop a novel OSC algorithm, S2OSC, that incorporates out-of-class
instances filtering and model re-training in a transductive manner. In detail,
given a pool of newly coming test data, S2OSC firstly filters distinct
out-of-class instances using the pre-trained model, and annotates super-class

in-class and out-of-class labeled data and remaining unlabeled test data in

experimental results show that S2OSC achieves state-of-the-art performance

coupling (SOC), which could be either intrinsic to the underlying crystal
lattice or heterostructure, or extrinsic via, for example, a micro-magnet. Here
we show that a key difference between the intrinsic SOC and the synthetic SOC
introduced by a micro-magnet is their symmetry under time reversal.
Specifically, the time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$-symmetry) of the
intrinsic SOC leads to not only the traditional van Vleck cancellation known
for spin relaxation, but also vanishing spin dephasing to the lowest order of
SOC, which we term as ""longitudinal spin-orbit field cancellation"". On the
other hand, the synthetic SOC from a micro-magnet breaks the
$\mathcal{T}$-symmetry, therefore eliminates both the ""van Vleck cancellation""
and the ""longitudinal spin-orbit field cancellation"". In other words, the
effective field $\vec\Omega$ experienced by the spin qubit does not depend on
the quantization magnetic field anymore, and a longitudinal component is
allowed for $\vec\Omega$ to the first order of SOC. Consequently, spin
relaxation and dephasing are qualitatively modified compared with the case of
the intrinsic SOC. Furthermore, the fidelity of electric-dipole spin resonance
based on $\vec\Omega$ could be optimized, with potential applications in
spin-based quantum computing.

have recently emerged taking advantage of light fields, as this new imaging
modality captures much more information about the angular direction of light

In this paper, we propose a novel depth estimation method from light fields
based on existing optical flow estimation methods. The optical flow estimator
is applied on a sequence of images taken along an angular dimension of the
light field, which produces several disparity map estimates. Considering both
accuracy and efficiency, we choose the feature flow method as our optical flow
estimator. Thanks to its spatio-temporal edge-aware filtering properties, the
different disparity map estimates that we obtain are very consistent, which
allows a fast and simple aggregation step to create a single disparity map,
which can then converted into a depth map. Since the disparity map estimates
are consistent, we can also create a depth map from each disparity estimate,
and then aggregate the different depth maps in the 3D space to create a single
dense depth map.

impact on the processing cost, especially when it is used for Big Data

differ based on the contents of the data blocks. Data variety-oblivious
allocation causes a reduction in the performance of VMs and increases the
processing cost. Thus, it is possible to reduce the total cost of the job by
matching the VMs with the given data blocks. We use a data-variety-aware
resource allocation approach to reduce the processing cost of the considered
job. For this issue, we divide the input data into some data blocks. We define
the significance of each data block and based on it we choose the appropriate
VMs to reduce the cost. For detecting the significance of each data portion, we
use a specific sampling method. This approach is applicable to accumulative
applications. We use some well-known benchmarks and configured servers for our
evaluations. Based on the results, our provisioning approach improves the

help identify and group malware families, as well as discover novel attacker

nearest-neighbor interactions and strong spin orbit coupling. The low symmetry
of these materials makes theoretical description complicated, with six distinct
nearest-neighbor coupling parameters allowed. In this Article, we ask what
kinds of classical, ordered, ground states can be expected to occur in these
materials, assuming generic (i.e. non-fine-tuned) sets of exchange parameters.
We use symmetry analysis to show that there are only five distinct classical
ground state phases occurring for generic parameters. The five phases are: (i)
a coplanar, 2-fold degenerate, state with vanishing magnetization (${\sf
A_1}$), (ii) a noncoplanar, 2-fold degenerate, state with magnetization
perpendicular to the kagome plane (${\sf A_2}$), (iii) a coplanar, 6-fold
degenerate, state with magnetization lying within the kagome plane (${\sf
E}$-coplanar), (iv) a noncoplanar, 6-fold degenerate, state with magnetization
lying within a mirror plane of the lattice (${\sf E}$-noncoplanar$_{6}$), (v) a
noncoplanar, 12-fold degenerate, state with magnetization in an arbitrary
direction (${\sf E}$-noncoplanar$_{12}$). All five are translation invariant
(${\bf q}=0$) states. Having found the set of possible ground states, the
ground state phase diagram is obtained by comparing numerically optimized
energies for each possibility as a function of the coupling parameters. The
state ${\sf E}$ noncoplanar$_{12}$ is extremely rare, occupying $<1\%$ of the
full phase diagram, so for practical purposes there are four main ordered
states likely to occur in anisotropic kagome magnets with dominant nearest
neighbor interactions. These results can aid in interpreting recent experiments
on ``tripod kagome'' systems R$_3$A$_2$Sb$_3$O$_{14}$, as well as materials
closer to the isotropic limit such as Cr- and Fe- jarosites.

formation theory and clusters' dynamical evolution. We develop a comprehensive
approach that models the color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of the cluster members
as the mixture of single stars and photometric unresolved binaries. This method
enables us to infer the binary properties, including the binary fraction
$f_\mathrm{b}$ and binary mass-ratio distribution index $\gamma_q$ when a
power-law is assumed, with high accuracy and precision, which were unfeasible
in conventional methods. We employ a modified Gaussian process to determine the
main sequence ridge line and its scatter from the observed CMD as model input.
As a first example, we apply the method to the open cluster NGC3532 with the
Gaia DR2 photometry. For the cluster members within a magnitude range
corresponding to FGK dwarfs, we obtain $f_\mathrm{b} = 0.267\pm0.019$ and
$\gamma_q = - 0.10\pm0.22$ for binaries with mass ratio $q > 0.2$. The
$f_\mathrm{b}$ value is consistent with the previous work on NGC3532 and
smaller than that of field stars. The close to zero $\gamma_q$ indicates that
the mass ratios of binaries follow a nearly uniform distribution. For the first
time, we unveil that the stars with smaller mass or in the inner region tend to
have lower $f_\mathrm{b}$ and more positive value of $\gamma_q$ due to the lack
of low mass-ratio binaries. The clear dependences of binary properties on mass
and radius are most likely caused by the internal dynamics.

observation: users are more sensitive to low quality in certain parts of a
video than in others. For instance, rebuffering during key moments of a sports
video (e.g., before a goal is scored) is more annoying than rebuffering during
normal gameplay. Such dynamic quality sensitivity, however, is rarely captured
by current approaches, which predict QoE (quality-of-experience) using
one-size-fits-all heuristics that are too simplistic to understand the nuances
of video content. Instead of proposing yet another heuristic, we take a
different approach: we run a separate crowdsourcing experiment for each video
to derive users' quality sensitivity at different parts of the video. Of
course, the cost of doing this at scale can be prohibitive, but we show that
careful experiment design combined with a suite of pruning techniques can make
the cost negligible compared to how much content providers invest in content
generation and distribution. Our ability to accurately profile time-varying
user sensitivity inspires a new approach: dynamically aligning higher (lower)
quality with higher (lower) sensitivity periods. We present a new video
streaming system called SENSEI that incorporates dynamic quality sensitivity
into existing quality adaptation algorithms. We apply SENSEI to two
state-of-the-art adaptation algorithms. SENSEI can take seemingly unusual
actions: e.g., lowering bitrate (or initiating a rebuffering event) even when
bandwidth is sufficient so that it can maintain a higher bitrate without
rebuffering when quality sensitivity becomes higher in the near future.
Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, SENSEI improves QoE by 15.1% or
achieves the same QoE with 26.8% less bandwidth on average.

Tomography (CT) exams depends significantly on the quantity and variability of

challenge itself, the variability of lesions in the dataset also depends on the
prevalence of different types of lesions. This phenomenon adds an inherent bias
to lesion segmentation algorithms that can be diminished, among different
possibilities, using aggressive data augmentation methods. In this paper, we
present a method for implanting realistic lesions in CT slices to provide a
rich and controllable set of training samples and ultimately improving semantic
segmentation network performances for delineating lesions in CT exams. Our
results show that implanting synthetic lesions not only improves (up to around
12\%) the segmentation performance considering different architectures but also
that this improvement is consistent among different image synthesis networks.
We conclude that increasing the variability of lesions synthetically in terms
of size, density, shape, and position seems to improve the performance of
segmentation models for liver lesion segmentation in CT slices.

theory, thermodynamics, regularization theory and non-destructive imaging,
especially for photoacoustic and photothermal imaging. The goal is to get a
better understanding of how information gaining for subsurface imaging works
and how the spatial resolution limit can be overcome by using additional
information. Here, the resolution limit in photoacoustic and photothermal
imaging is derived from the irreversibility of attenuation of the pressure wave
and of heat diffusion during propagation of the signals from the imaged
subsurface structures to the sample surface, respectively. The acoustic or
temperature signals are converted into so-called virtual waves, which are their
reversible counterparts and which can be used for image reconstruction by
well-known ultrasound reconstruction methods. The conversion into virtual waves
is an ill-posed inverse problem which needs regularization. The reason for that
is the information loss during signal propagation to the sample surface, which
turns out to be equal to the entropy production. As the entropy production from
acoustic attenuation is usually small compared to the entropy production from
heat diffusion, the spatial resolution in acoustic imaging is higher than in
thermal imaging. Therefore, it is especially necessary to overcome this
resolution limit for thermographic imaging by using additional information.
Incorporating sparsity and non-negativity in iterative regularization methods
gives a significant resolution enhancement, which was experimentally
demonstrated by one-dimensional imaging of thin layers with varying depth or by
three-dimensional imaging, either from a single detection plane or from three
perpendicular detection planes on the surface of a sample cube.

earthquakes along geological faults, invokes an analogy to ordinary cracks. A
distinct feature of ordinary cracks is that their near edge fields are
characterized by a square root singularity, which is intimately related to the
existence of strict dissipation-related lengthscale separation and
edge-localized energy balance. Yet, the interrelations between the singularity
order, lengthscale separation and edge-localized energy balance in frictional
rupture are not fully understood, even in physical situations in which the
conventional square root singularity remains approximately valid. Here we
develop a macroscopic theory that shows that the generic rate-dependent nature
of friction leads to deviations from the conventional singularity, and that
even if this deviation is small, significant non-edge-localized rupture-related
dissipation emerges. The physical origin of the latter, which is predicted to
vanish identically in the crack analogy, is the breakdown of scale separation
that leads an accumulated spatially-extended dissipation, involving macroscopic
scales. The non-edge-localized rupture-related dissipation is also predicted to
be position dependent. The theoretical predictions are quantitatively supported
by available numerical results, and their possible implications for earthquake
physics are discussed.

computationally simpler compared to many existing gradient-filters such as
multi-KRUM, geometric median-of-means, and the spectral filters. We empirically
show, by simulating distributed learning on neural networks, that the
fault-tolerance of CGE is comparable to that of existing gradient-filters. We
also empirically show that exponential averaging of stochastic gradients
improves the fault-tolerance of a generic gradient-filter.

also extracts more coherent topics compared with existing neural topic models

concerned with two major challenges. The first one is the integration of

ultrasound and lidar, offline map data or backend information. The second
challenge comprises in finding an abstract representation of this aggregated

is a reasonable choice. In this paper, we show that role-based motion

range. In the last years, the flat radio-to-mid-IR spectra of Black Hole (BH)
X-ray binaries was described using the internal shocks model, which assumes
that the fluctuations in the velocity of the ejecta along the jet are driven by
the fluctuations in the accretion flow, described by the X-ray Power Density

to a Neutron Star (NS) LMXB, i.e. 4U 0614+091. We used the multi-wavelength

updated version of the internal shocks code for the ejection. The new version
of the code allows to change the geometry of the jet for the case of
non-conical jets. Only two alternative scenarios provide a satisfactory
description of the data: using the X-ray PDS but in a non-conical geometry for
the jet, or either using a conical geometry but with a ""flicker-noise"" PDS.
Both scenarios would imply some differences with the results obtained with
similar models on BH X-ray binaries, shedding light on the possibility that
jets in NS and BH binaries might somehow have a different geometry or a
different coupling with the accretion flow.

Our model departs from the usual, unrealistic assumption of uniform probability

randomly. Instead, we demonstrate that a two-mechanism model in which the
probability of direct citation is proportional to the number of authors on a
paper (team size) is able to reproduce the empirical citation distributions of
articles published in the field of astronomy remarkably well, and at different
points in time. Interpretation of our model is that the intrinsic citation
capacity, and hence the initial visibility of a paper, will be enhanced when
more people are intimately familiar with some work, favoring papers from larger
teams. While the intrinsic citation capacity cannot depend only on the team
size, our model demonstrates that it must be to some degree correlated with it,
and distributed in a similar way, i.e., having a power-law tail. Consequently,
our team-size model qualitatively explains the existence of a correlation
between the number of citations and the number of authors on a paper.

%, to guide ablation therapy and predict treatment results for atrial

challenging, due to the poor image quality, the various LA shapes, the thin

the two tasks independently and ignored the intrinsic spatial relationship
between LA and scars. In this work, we develop a new framework, namely
AtrialJSQnet, where LA segmentation, scar projection onto the LA surface, and
scar quantification are performed simultaneously in an end-to-end style. We
propose a mechanism of shape attention (SA) via an explicit surface projection,
to utilize the inherent correlation between LA and LA scars. In specific, the
SA scheme is embedded into a multi-task architecture to perform joint LA
segmentation and scar quantification. Besides, a spatial encoding (SE) loss is
introduced to incorporate continuous spatial information of the target, in
order to reduce noisy patches in the predicted segmentation. We evaluated the
proposed framework on 60 LGE MRIs from the MICCAI2018 LA challenge. Extensive
experiments on a public dataset demonstrated the effect of the proposed
AtrialJSQnet, which achieved competitive performance over the state-of-the-art.
The relatedness between LA segmentation and scar quantification was explicitly
explored and has shown significant performance improvements for both tasks. The

Building on the class of congestion games we study the evolution of commuting

Universe at large scales, but shows some serious difficulties at small scales:
the inner dark matter (DM) density profiles of spiral galaxies generally appear
to be cored, without the $r^{-1}$ predicted by N-body simulations in the above
scenario.
  In a more physical context, the baryons in the galaxy might backreact and
erase the original cusp through supernova explosions. Before that this effect
be investigated, it is important to determine how wide and frequent the
discrepancy between observed and N-body predicted profiles is and what its
features are. We used more than 3200 quite extended rotation curves (RCs) of
good quality and high resolution of disk systems. The curves cover all
magnitude ranges. These RCs were condensed into 26 coadded RCs, each of them
built with individual RCs of galaxies of similar luminosity and morphology. We
performed mass models of these 26 RCs using the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)
profile for the contribution of the DM halo to the circular velocity and the
exponential Freeman disk for that of the stellar disk. The fits are generally
poor in all the 26 cases: in several cases, we find $\chi^2_{red}>2$. Moreover,
the best-fitting values of three parameters of the model ($c$, $M_D$, and
$M_{vir}$) combined with those of their 1$\sigma$ uncertainty clearly
contradict well-known expectations of the $\Lambda$CDM scenario. We also tested
the scaling relations that exist in spirals with the fitting outcome: the
modeling does not account for these scaling relations.
  Therefore, NFW halo density law cannot account for the kinematics of the
whole family of disk galaxies. It is therefore mandatory for the $\Lambda CDM$

approach is to represent the DGP as a non-linear hierarchical system of linear
stochastic differential equations (SDEs), where each SDE corresponds to a
conditional GP. The DGP regression problem then becomes a state estimation
problem, and we can estimate the state efficiently with sequential methods by
using the Markov property of the state-space DGP. The computational complexity
scales linearly with respect to the number of measurements. Based on this, we
formulate state-space MAP as well as Bayesian filtering and smoothing solutions
to the DGP regression problem. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed

These advances motivate the study of the interaction between topological matter

this work, we study a waveguide-interfaced topological atom array. The
light-matter interaction is nontrivially modified by topology, yielding novel
optical phenomena. We find topology-enhanced photon absorption from the
waveguide for large Purcell factor, i.e., $\Gamma/\Gamma_0\gg 1$, where
$\Gamma$ and $\Gamma_0$ are the atomic decays to waveguide and environment,
respectively. To understand this unconventional photon absorption, we propose a
multi-channel scattering approach and study the interaction spectra for edge-
and bulk-state channels. We find that, by breaking inversion and time-reversal
symmetries, optical anisotropy is enabled for reflection process, but the
transmission is isotropic. Through a perturbation analysis of the edge-state
channel, we show that the anisotropy in the reflection process originates from
the waveguide-mediated non-Hermitian interaction. However, the inversion
symmetry in the non-Hermitian interaction makes the transmission isotropic. At
a topology-protected atomic spacing, the subradiant edge state exhibits huge
anisotropy. Due to the interplay between edge- and bulk-state channels, a large
topological bandgap enhances nonreciprocal reflection of photons in the
waveguide for weakly broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e., $\Gamma_0/\Gamma\ll
1$, producing complete photon absorption. We show that our proposal can be
implemented in superconducting quantum circuits. The topology-enhanced photon
absorption is useful for quantum detection. This work shows the potential to
manipulate light with topological quantum matter.

exciton resonances has not been fully clarified yet. Here, we combine first
principle calculations with the excitonic density matrix formalism to study
transitions between different moir\'e exciton phases and their impact on
optical properties of the twisted MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ heterostructure. At angles
smaller than 2$^{\circ}$ we find flat, moir\'e trapped states for inter- and
intralayer excitons. This moir\'e exciton phase drastically changes into
completely delocalized states already at 3$^{\circ}$. We predict a linear and
quadratic twist-angle dependence of excitonic resonances for the
moir\'e-trapped and delocalized exciton phase, respectively. Our work provides
microscopic insights opening the possibility to tailor moir\'e exciton phases
in van der Waals superlattices.

networks achieved significant progress w.r.t. the mean Intersection-over Union

essentially ignore the difference of severity for an autonomous car with
different wrong prediction mistakes. For example, predicting the car to the
road is much more servery than recognize it as the bus. Targeting for this
difficulty, we develop a Wasserstein training framework to explore the
inter-class correlation by defining its ground metric as misclassification
severity. The ground metric of Wasserstein distance can be pre-defined
following the experience on a specific task. From the optimization perspective,
we further propose to set the ground metric as an increasing function of the
pre-defined ground metric. Furthermore, an adaptively learning scheme of the
ground matrix is proposed to utilize the high-fidelity CARLA simulator.
Specifically, we follow a reinforcement alternative learning scheme. The
experiments on both CamVid and Cityscapes datasets evidenced the effectiveness
of our Wasserstein loss. The SegNet, ENet, FCN and Deeplab networks can be
adapted following a plug-in manner. We achieve significant improvements on the

for the Riemann hypothesis by creating a new harmonic series $H^\prime_n = 2H_n
- H_{2n}$ and demonstrating that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to
$\sigma(n) \leq \frac{3n}{\log{n}} + \exp{H^\prime_n}\log{H^\prime_n}$ for all
odd $n \geq 3$. We prove stronger analogues to Robin's inequality for odd
squarefree numbers. Furthermore, we find a general formula that studies the

physical conditions and the abundances of simple, most abundant molecules based

calculated chemical output, the calculations are redone with the same chemical
model for all three sets of physical input parameters. With the differences
arising from the chemical models eliminated, the output is compared based on
the influence of the physical model. Results suggest that the impact of the

address this challenge by proposing a stereo matching network that considers

entropy operations. Next, a learned attenuation is applied as the robust loss
function to alleviate the influence of weakly matchable pixels in the training.
Finally, a matchability-aware disparity refinement is introduced to improve the
depth inference in weakly matchable regions. The proposed deep stereo
matchability (DSM) framework can improve the matching result or accelerate the
computation while still guaranteeing the quality. Moreover, the DSM framework
is portable to many recent stereo networks. Extensive experiments are conducted
on Scene Flow and KITTI stereo datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework over the state-of-the-art learning-based stereo methods.

random case selection; and (2) Phase 2 - concerned with simulated-clinical
Trialing of the developed algorithm on a per-case basis in a more real-world

application which provides a vessel-by-vessel graphic display of algorithm
inference results integrated into a clinically capable viewer. Algorithm
performance evaluation used Area Under the Receiver-Operating-Characteristic

determinations. The vessel-based algorithm demonstrated strong performance with
AUC-ROC = 0.96. In both Phase 1 and Phase 2, independent of disease prevalence
differences, negative predictive values at the case level were very high at
95%. The rate of completion of the algorithm workflow process (96% with

ask how habitability, defined in part by the presence of liquid water, was

coevolving environments and biosphere spanning the last few billion years

the findings have profoundly impacted the search for life beyond Earth. Yet
life's very beginnings during the first hundreds of millions of years of our

emergence on Earth were tied intimately to the evolving chemical and physical
conditions of our earliest environments. Yet, a rigorous, interdisciplinary
understanding of that relationship has not been explored adequately and once
better understood will inform our search for life beyond Earth. In this way,
studies of the emergence of life must become a truly interdisciplinary effort,
requiring a mix that expands the traditional platform of prebiotic chemistry to

approximation for the case with $S'(r_h)\leq 0$, where $S(r_h)$ is the entropy
of the background black hole geometry in Lanczos-Lovelock gravity. It implies
that the WCCC is violated in these situations. For the case with $S'(r_h)>0$,
the nearly extremal black holes cannot be overcharged by the new version of the

that the WCCC will play a natural role to constrain the Lanczos-Lovelock

the continuous spontaneous localization (CSL) dynamical collapse theory to the

here will have to await, not only for a general relativistic CSL theory, but
for a fully workable theory of quantum gravity. Our concern here is to explore
these issues, and to warn against premature conclusions. This exploration
includes: two different approaches to deal with quantum field theory and
gravitation, the identification of the collapse-generating operator and the
general nature and values of the parameters of the CSL theory. All the choices
connected with these issues have the potential to dramatically alter the
conclusions one can draw. We also argue that the incompatibilities found in a
recent paper, between the CSL parameter values and the CMB observational data,
are associated with specific choices made for the extrapolation to the
cosmological context of the CSL theory (as it is known to work in
non-relativistic laboratory situations) which do not represent the most natural
ones.

coaxial illumination of dual incoherent counter propagating Bessel beams. In
the case of spheres we derive analytical expressions for the optical binding

years. Highly complex sequential decision making problems have been solved in

some important applications. Model-based reinforcement learning creates an
explicit model of the environment dynamics to reduce the need for environment

correct high energy asymptotics of correlation functions in QCD. It is known,
however, that the KK modes of dual theory must be qualitatively different from
real hadrons. And what is more important, the radially excited states appear in
lattice calculations not as ""excitations"" of some ground state, but rather as
independent states coupled to higher dimensional QCD operators - the larger is
a basis of interpolating operators, the larger set of states can be resolved. A
question arises whether it is possible to reconcile the holographic and lattice
descriptions of radially excited hadrons? We propose a new phenomenological
""consistency test"" for bottom-up holographic models: If the KK spectrum of
massive 5D fields corresponding to higher dimensional operators in QCD
coincides with the conventional radial KK spectrum, then the holographic KK
states can be identified with real excited mesons in the large-Nc limit of QCD
- as in the lattice QCD, they become a superposition of several states
interpolated by operators of different canonical dimensions. We demonstrate
that the Soft Wall holographic model passes this test while the Hard Wall model
does not.

automated decision-making systems, AI bias is becoming more apparent and
problematic. One of its negative consequences is discrimination: the unfair, or
unequal treatment of individuals based on certain characteristics. However, the
relationship between bias and discrimination is not always clear. In this
paper, we survey relevant literature about bias and discrimination in AI from
an interdisciplinary perspective that embeds technical, legal, social and
ethical dimensions. We show that finding solutions to bias and discrimination
in AI requires robust cross-disciplinary collaborations.

appearance of research centres, projects or institutions addressing AI

new approach to assessment comprising ethical guidelines, reports or tools and
frameworks to help both academia and business to move towards a responsible
conceptualisation of AI. They all highlight the relevance of three key aspects:
(i) enhancing cooperation among the different stakeholders involved in the
design, deployment and use of AI; (ii) promoting multidisciplinary dialogue,
including different domains of expertise in this process; and (iii) fostering
public engagement to maximise a trusted relation with new technologies and
practitioners. In this paper, we introduce the Observatory on Society and
Artificial Intelligence (OSAI), an initiative grew out of the project AI4EU
aimed at stimulating reflection on a broad spectrum of issues of AI (ethical,
legal, social, economic and cultural). In particular, we describe our work in
progress around OSAI and suggest how this and similar initiatives can promote a
wider appraisal of progress in AI. This will give us the opportunity to present
our vision and our modus operandi to enhance the implementation of these three

present a prototype able to support collectors in predicting the payment of
invoices. This prototype is part of a solution developed in partnership with a

interaction. Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) are an machine learning (ML) subclass
inspired by the process of natural selection - Survival of the Fittest, as
stated by the Darwinian Theory of Evolution. The most notable algorithm in that
class is the Genetic Algorithm (GA) - a powerful heuristic tool which enables
the generation of a high-quality solutions to optimization problems. In recent
decades the algorithm underwent remarkable improvement, which adapted it into a
wide range of engineering problems, by heuristically searching for the optimal
solution. Despite being well-defined, many engineering problems may suffer from
heavy analytical entanglement when approaching the derivation process, as
required in classic optimization methods. Therefore, the main motivation here,
is to work around that obstacle. In this piece of work, I would like to harness
the GA capabilities to examine optimality with respect to a unique combustion
problem, in a way that was never performed before. To be more precise, I would
like to utilize it to answer the question : What form of an initial droplet
size distribution (iDSD) will guarantee an optimal flame ? To answer this
question, I will first provide a general introduction to the GA method, then
develop the combustion model, and eventually merge both into an optimization
problem.

on multiple timescales. On short timescales, super-spreading events lead to
burstiness and overdispersion, while long-term persistent heterogeneity in
susceptibility is expected to lead to a reduction in the infection peak and the
herd immunity threshold (HIT). Here, we develop a general approach to encompass
both timescales, including time variations in individual social activity, and
demonstrate how to incorporate them phenomenologically into a wide class of
epidemiological models through parameterization. We derive a non-linear
dependence of the effective reproduction number Re on the susceptible
population fraction S. We show that a state of transient collective immunity
(TCI) emerges well below the HIT during early, high-paced stages of the
epidemic. However, this is a fragile state that wanes over time due to changing
levels of social activity, and so the infection peak is not an indication of
herd immunity: subsequent waves can and will emerge due to behavioral changes
in the population, driven (e.g.) by seasonal factors. Transient and long-term
levels of heterogeneity are estimated by using empirical data from the COVID-19
epidemic as well as from real-life face-to-face contact networks. These results
suggest that the hardest-hit areas, such as NYC, have achieved TCI following
the first wave of the epidemic, but likely remain below the long-term HIT.
Thus, in contrast to some previous claims, these regions can still experience
subsequent waves.

challenge, to cite the flow field reconstruction as a typical example. The huge
computational cost of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) makes it much
expensive for large scale CFD data producing, which is the reason why we need
some cheaper ways to do this, of which the traditional reduced order models
(ROMs) were promising but they couldn't generate a large number of full domain
flow field data (FFD) to realize high-precision flow field reconstructions.
Motivated by the problems of existing approaches and inspired by the success of
the generative adversarial networks (GANs) in the field of computer vision, we
prove an optimal discriminator theorem that the optimal discriminator of a GAN
is a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) while dealing with nonlinear
sparse FFD regression and generation. Based on this theorem, two radial basis
function-based GANs (RBF-GAN and RBFC-GAN), for regression and generation
purposes, are proposed. Three different datasets are applied to verify the
feasibility of our models. The results show that the performance of the RBF-GAN
and the RBFC-GAN are better than that of GANs/cGANs by means of both the mean
square error (MSE) and the mean square percentage error (MSPE). Besides,
compared with GANs/cGANs, the stability of the RBF-GAN and the RBFC-GAN improve
by 34.62% and 72.31%, respectively. Consequently, our proposed models can be
used to generate full domain FFD from limited and sparse datasets, to meet the
requirement of high-precision flow field reconstructions.

applies prioritized replay to redistribute data between the three algorithms in

enhances sample diversity and algorithm exploration. Additionally, greedy
replay is used implicitly within SA to improve PESA exploitation close to the
end of evolution. The validation against 12 high-dimensional continuous
benchmark functions shows superior performance by PESA against standalone ES,
PSO, and SA, under similar initial starting points, hyperparameters, and number

statistical models were used to compute the deceleration, acceleration and

kinematic equations that were then used to compute both the deceleration and
acceleration times. The adopted method to estimate both the deceleration time
and the acceleration time was validated utilizing transit data from Blacksburg
Transit (BT) using the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean
square error (RMSE). The MAPE and RMSE values were calculated to be 0.3 and
13.3 percent for the deceleration time and 0.42 and 2.72 percent for the

estimating the merge-time model coefficients. The proposed models can be
