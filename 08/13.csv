assembly and the difficulty of non-contact high-precision measurement, a
structured light binocular measurement technology for key components of
aero-engine is proposed in this paper. Combined with three-dimensional point
cloud data processing and assembly position matching algorithm, the
high-precision measurement of shaft hole assembly posture in the process of
turbine shaft docking is realized. Firstly, the screw thread curve on the bolt
surface is segmented based on PCA projection and edge point cloud clustering,
and Hough transform is used to model fit the three-dimensional thread curve.
Then the preprocessed two-dimensional convex hull is constructed to segment the
key hole location features, and the mounting surface and hole location obtained
by segmentation are fitted based on RANSAC method. Finally, the geometric
feature matching is used the evaluation index of turbine shaft assembly is
established to optimize the pose. The final measurement accuracy of mounting
surface matching is less than 0.05mm, and the measurement accuracy of mounting
hole matching based on minimum ance optimization is less than 0.1 degree. The
measurement algorithm is implemented on the automatic assembly test-bed of a
certain type of aero-engine low-pressure turbine rotor. In the narrow
installation space, the assembly process of the turbine shaft assembly, such as
the automatic alignment and docking of the shaft hole, the automatic heating
and temperature measurement of the installation seam, and the automatic
tightening of the two guns, are realized in the narrow installation space
Guidance, real-time inspection and assembly result evaluation.

compared to a control in the overall population and in subpopulations defined
by baseline characteristics. Often, however, clinical questions also arise
regarding the treatment effect in subpopulations of patients, which would
experience clinical or disease related events post-randomization. Events that
occur after treatment initiation and potentially affect the interpretation or
the existence of the measurements are called {\it intercurrent events} in the
ICH E9(R1) guideline. If the intercurrent event is a consequence of treatment,
randomization alone is no longer sufficient to meaningfully estimate the
treatment effect. Analyses comparing the subgroups of patients without the
intercurrent events for intervention and control will not estimate a causal
effect. This is well known, but post-hoc analyses of this kind are commonly
performed in drug development. An alternative approach is the principal stratum
strategy, which classifies subjects according to their potential occurrence of
an intercurrent event on both study arms. We illustrate with examples that
questions formulated through principal strata occur naturally in drug
development and argue that approaching these questions with the ICH E9(R1)
estimand framework has the potential to lead to more transparent assumptions as
well as more adequate analyses and conclusions. In addition, we provide an
overview of assumptions required for estimation of effects in principal strata.
Most of these assumptions are unverifiable and should hence be based on solid
scientific understanding. Sensitivity analyses are needed to assess robustness
of conclusions.

diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) capable of resolving complex fiber

number of gradient directions (b-vecs), a high maximum b-value(b-vals), and
multiple b-values (multi-shell). However, acquisition time is limited in a
clinical setting and commercial scanners may not provide such dMRI sequences.
Therefore, dMRI is often acquired as single-shell (single b-value). In this
work, we learn improved FODs for commercially acquired MRI. We evaluate
patch-based 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs)on their ability to regress
multi-shell FOD representations from single-shell representations, where the
representation is a spherical harmonics obtained from constrained spherical
deconvolution (CSD) to model FODs. We evaluate U-Net and HighResNet 3D CNN
architectures on data from the Human Connectome Project and an in-house

orientation 1) when training and testing on datasets with the same dMRI
acquisition protocol; 2) when testing on a dataset with a different dMRI
acquisition protocol than used to train the CNN models; and 3) when testing on
a dataset with a fewer number of gradient directions than used to train the CNN
models. Our approach may enable robust CSD model estimation on single-shell
dMRI acquisition protocols with few gradient directions, reducing acquisition
times, facilitating translation of improved FOD estimation to time-limited

distinct set of global parametric transformations to be applied to the

prior state-of-the-art. In contrast to existing attention shifting algorithms,
our global parametric approach better preserves image semantics and avoids
typical generative artifacts. Our edits enable inference at interactive rates
on any image size, and easily generalize to videos. Extensions of our model
allow for multi-style edits and the ability to both increase and attenuate
attention in an image region. Furthermore, users can customize the edited
images by dialing the edits up or down via interpolations in parameter space.

theoretical framework has been well established for most aspects, feature
extraction and association is still empirically designed in most cases, and can
be vulnerable in complex environments. This paper shows that feature extraction
with deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be seamlessly incorporated
into a modern SLAM framework. The proposed SLAM system utilizes a
state-of-the-art CNN to detect keypoints in each image frame, and to give not
only keypoint descriptors, but also a global descriptor of the whole image.
These local and global features are then used by different SLAM modules,
resulting in much more robustness against environmental changes and viewpoint
changes compared with using hand-crafted features. We also train a visual
vocabulary of local features with a Bag of Words (BoW) method. Based on the
local features, global features, and the vocabulary, a highly reliable loop
closure detection method is built. Experimental results show that all the
proposed modules significantly outperforms the baseline, and the full system
achieves much lower trajectory errors and much higher correct rates on all
evaluated data. Furthermore, by optimizing the CNN with Intel OpenVINO toolkit
and utilizing the Fast BoW library, the system benefits greatly from the SIMD
(single-instruction-multiple-data) techniques in modern CPUs. The full system
can run in real-time without any GPU or other accelerators. The code is public

implies a higher radiative accretion efficiency, and thus possibly a higher
spin for black holes than indicated by surveys in the optical and X-ray. The
unique mid-infrared spectrographic capability of Spitzer gave important
insights into the distribution and nature of the dust surrounding AGNs,
enabling the separation of AGN and starburst components, the detection of
silicate features in emission from hot dust, and the identification of shocked
gas associated with AGN activity. The sensitivity of Spitzer allowed almost
complete identification of the host galaxies of samples of AGNs selected in the
X-ray and radio. As we look forward to the James Webb Space Telescope, the
lessons learned from Spitzer studies will inform observational programs with
new and upcoming infrared facilities.

Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP) is examined which has yet to materialise as

the NASA Rover/NERVA programs, actually has a higher TRL than laser propulsion.
Various solid reactor core options are studied, using either engines directly
derived from the NASA programs, or more advanced options, like a proposed
particle bed NTP system. With specific impulses at least twice those of
chemical rockets, NTP opens the opportunity for much higher {\Delta}V budgets,
allowing simpler and more direct, time-saving trajectories to be exploited. For
example a spacecraft with an upgraded NERVA/Pewee-class NTP travelling along an

becomes constrained to travel along certain substrate symmetry directions. Such
locking effects arise for colloids and superconducting vortices moving over
ordered substrates when the direction of the external drive is varied. Here we
study the directional locking of run-and-tumble active matter particles
interacting with a periodic array of obstacles. In the absence of an external
biasing force, we find that the active particle motion locks to various
symmetry directions of the substrate when the run time between tumbles is
large. The number of possible locking directions depends on the array density
and on the relative sizes of the particles and the obstacles. For a square
array of large obstacles, the active particle only locks to the $x$, $y$, and
$45^{\circ}$ directions, while for smaller obstacles, the number of locking
angles increases. Each locking angle satisfies $\theta = \arctan(p/q)$, where
$p$ and $q$ are integers, and the angle of motion can be measured using the
ratio of the velocities or the velocity distributions in the $x$ and $y$
directions. When a biasing driving force is applied, the directional locking
behavior is affected by the ratio of the self-propulsion force to the biasing
force. For large biasing, the behavior resembles that found for directional
locking in passive systems. For large obstacles under biased driving, a
trapping behavior occurs that is non-monotonic as a function of increasing run
length or increasing self-propulsion force, and the trapping diminishes when
the run length is sufficiently large.

aspects of shapes, geometry, and structure, are encoded in a synergistic manner
to ensure plausibility of the generated shapes, while also being disentangled

applications with disentangled control, such as interpolation of structure

simultaneously learn structure and geometry through variational autoencoders

AAAtrig inherits all the favourable characteristics of AAA and is thus
extremely flexible and robust, being able to consider quite general sets of
sample points in the complex plane. We consider a range of applications with
particular emphasis on solving Laplace's equation in periodic domains and
compressing periodic conformal maps. These results reproduce the tapered
exponential clustering effect observed in other recent studies. The algorithm

  version v2",,,,"math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  There are two main classes of dispersion models studied in the literature:
proper (PDM), and exponential dispersion models (EDM). Dispersion models that
are neither proper nor exponential dispersion models are termed here
non-standard dispersion models (NSDM). This paper exposes a technique for
constructing new PDMs and NSDMs. This construction provides a solution to an
open question in the theory of dispersion models about the extension of
non-standard dispersion models. Given a unit deviance function, a dispersion
model is usually constructed by calculating a normalising function that makes
the density function integrates one. This calculation involves the solution of
non-trivial integral equations. The main idea explored here is to use
characteristic functions of real non-lattice symmetric probability measures to
construct a family of unit deviances that are sufficiently regular to make the
associated integral equations tractable. The integral equations associated to
those unit deviances admit a trivial solution, in the sense that the
normalising function is a constant function independent of the observed values.
However, we show, using the machinery of distributions (i.e., generalised
functions) and expansions of the normalising function with respect to specially
constructed Riez systems, that those integral equations also admit infinitely
many non-trivial solutions, generating many NSDMs. We conclude that, the
cardinality of the class of non-standard dispersion models is larger than the
cardinality of the class of real non-lattice symmetric probability measures.

usually implemented within smart contracts developed through Solidity, a
programming language for writing smart contracts on different blockchain

on the machines of miners and the gas corresponds to the execution fee
compensating such computing resources. However, the deployment and execution
costs of a smart contract depend on the implementation choices done by
developers. Unappropriated design choices could lead to higher gas consumption
than necessary. In this paper, we (i) identify a set of 19 Solidity code smells
affecting the deployment and transaction costs of a smart contract, and (ii)
assess the relevance of such smells through a survey involving 34 participants.
On top of these smells, we propose GasMet, a suite of metrics for statically
evaluating the code quality of a smart contract from the gas consumption

the proposed metrics have direct associations with deployment costs. The
metrics in our suite can be used for more easily identifying source code

quantum verification algorithms, which encode the solution into quantum bits

verify satisfiable and unsatisfiable SAT instances and achieve a clear
completeness-soundness gap even in the presence of experimental imperfections.
The protocol requires only unentangled photons, linear operations on multiple

protocol suitable for photonic realization and scalable to large problem sizes.

giant stars plays an important role in shaping the orbits of pre-common
envelope systems. Such systems are possible sources of transients and close
compact binary systems that will eventually merge and produce detectable
gravitational wave signals. Most previous studies of the onset of common
envelope episodes have focused on circular orbits and synchronously rotating
donor stars under the assumption that tidal dissipation can quickly spin up the
primary and circularize the orbit before the binary reaches Roche-lobe overflow
(RLO). We test this assumption by coupling numerical models of the post main
sequence stellar evolution of massive-stars with the model for tidal
dissipation in convective envelopes developed in Vick & Lai (2020) $-$ a tidal
model that is accurate even for highly eccentric orbits with small pericentre
distances. We find that, in many cases, tidal dissipation does not circularize
the orbit before RLO. For a $10~M_\odot$ ($15~M_\odot$) primary star
interacting with a $1.4~M_\odot$ companion, systems with pericentre distances
within 3 AU (6 AU) when the primary leaves the main sequence will retain the
initial orbital eccentricity when the primary grows to the Roche radius. Even
in systems that tidally circularize before RLO, the donor star may be rotating
subsynchronously at the onset of mass transfer. Our results demonstrate that
some possible precursors to double neutron star systems are likely eccentric at
the Roche radius. The effects of pre-common envelope eccentricity on the
resulting compact binary merit further study.

known about low-mass host galaxies at higher red-shift. To improve our

Fornax dwarf spheroidal satellite of the Milky Way, remain mostly unchanged

of satellites per host, which suggests that the stellar masses of the hosts are
in the power-law regime of the stellar mass to halo mass relation
$(M_*-M_{\text{halo}})$ for low-mass galaxies. Finally, we test the

subset of the transiting planet population. With masses in the super-Earth
range ($1-10$ M$_{\oplus}$) and radii akin to those of giant planets ($>4$
R$_{\oplus}$), their large envelopes may have been accreted beyond the water
snow line and many appear to be susceptible to catastrophic mass loss. Both the
presence of water and the importance of mass loss can be explored using
transmission spectroscopy. Here, we present new HST WFC3 spectroscopy and
updated Kepler transit depth measurements for the super-puff Kepler-79d. We do
not detect any molecular absorption features in the $1.1-1.7$ $\mu$m WFC3
bandpass and the combination of Kepler and WFC3 data are consistent with a flat
line model, indicating the presence of aerosols in the atmosphere. We compare
the shape of Kepler-79d's transmission spectrum to predictions from a
microphysical haze model that incorporates an outward particle flux due to
ongoing mass loss. We find that photochemical hazes offer an attractive
explanation for the observed properties of super-puffs like Kepler-79d, as they
simultaneously render the near-infrared spectrum featureless and reduce the
inferred envelope mass loss rate by moving the measured radius (optical depth
unity surface during transit) to lower pressures. We revisit the broader
question of mass loss rates for super-puffs and find that the age estimates and
mass loss rates for the majority of super-puffs can be reconciled if hazes move
the photosphere from the typically assumed pressure of $\sim 10$ mbar to $\sim

twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), for which local fluctuations of the twist angle
give rise to a spatially random Fermi velocity. In a description that includes
only spatial variation of Fermi velocity, we derive the
incident-angle-dependent localization length for the case of
quasi-one-dimensional disorder by mapping this problem onto one dimensional
Anderson localization. The localization length diverges at normal incidence as
a consequence of Klein tunneling, leading to a power-law decay of the
transmission when averaged over incidence angle. In a minimal model of TBG, the
modulation of twist angle also shifts the location of the Dirac cones in
momentum space in a way that can be described by a random gauge field, and thus
Klein tunneling is inexact. However, when the Dirac electron's incident
momentum is large compared to these shifts, the primary effect of twist
disorder is only to shift the incident angle associated with perfect
transmission away from zero. These results suggest a mechanism for
disorder-induced collimation, valley filtration, and energy filtration of Dirac
electron beams, so that TBG offers a promising new platform for Dirac fermion
optics.

analyse in detail the kinematics of seven TNG50 galaxies from five different
projections per galaxy, and compare them to observations of twelve massive SFGs
by Genzel et al. (2020). The simulated galaxies show clear signs of disc
rotation but mostly exhibit more asymmetric rotation curves, partly due to
large intrinsic radial and vertical velocity components. At identical
inclination angle, their one-dimensional velocity profiles can vary along
different lines of sight by up to $\Delta v=200$ km s$^{-1}$. From dynamical
modelling we infer rotation speeds and velocity dispersions that are broadly
consistent with observational results. We find low central dark matter
fractions compatible with observations ($f_{\rm DM}^v(<R_e)=v_{\rm
DM}^2(R_e)/v_{\rm circ}^2(R_e)\sim0.32\pm0.10$), however for disc effective
radii $R_e$ that are mostly too small: at fixed $R_e$ the TNG50 dark matter
fractions are too high by a factor of $\sim2$. We speculate that the
differences in gas kinematics and dark matter content compared to the
observations may be due to physical processes that are not resolved in
sufficient detail with the numerical resolution available in current
cosmological simulations.

globular clusters (GCs), and its kinematics is consistent with the presence of
little to no dark matter. As the velocity dispersion among the GCs is
comparable to the expected internal dispersions of the individual GCs, the
galaxy might be highly conducive to GC-GC merging. If true, this could explain
the puzzling luminosity function of its GCs. Here, we examine this possibility
by re-simulating three of our earlier simulations of the GC system (Dutta
Chowdhury et al. 2019), where the GCs were modeled as single particles, with
live GCs. Somewhat surprisingly, we infer a low merger rate of $\sim 0.03\ \rm
Gyr^{-1}$. The main reason is that the GCs are too dense for tidal shock
capture, caused by impulsive encounters among them, to operate efficiently (we
infer a tidal capture rate of only $\sim 0.002\ \rm Gyr^{-1}$). Therefore,
whatever mergers occur are driven by other mechanisms, which we find to be
captures induced by dynamical friction and compressive tides from other GCs.
The low merger rate inferred here makes it unlikely that the unusually large
luminosities of the GCs can be explained as a result of past GC-GC mergers. Our
simulations also indicate that, if NGC 1052-DF2 is indeed largely devoid of
dark matter, its tidal field is too weak to induce any significant mass loss
from the GCs. Therefore, in such a scenario, we predict that it is improbable
for the GCs to reveal tidal features, something that can be tested with future
deep observations.

of the radio continuum emission at 33 GHz from 33 extranuclear star-forming

metallicity-dependent scatter and offsets. We find similar
metallicity-dependent trends in commonly used SFR tracers such as H$\alpha$ and
24$\mu$m. As seen in previous studies, PAH emission alone is a poor SFR tracer
due to a strong metallicity dependence: lower metallicity regions show
decreased PAH emission relative to their SFR compared to higher metallicity
regions. We construct combinations of PAH bands, neon emission lines, and their
respective ratios to minimize metallicity trends. The calibrations that most
accurately trace SFR with minimal metallicity dependence involve the sum of the
integrated intensities of the 12.81$\mu$m [Ne II] line and the 15.56$\mu$m [Ne

emission. This mid-IR calibration is a useful tool for measuring SFR as it is
minimally sensitive to variations in metallicity and it is composed of bright,
ubiquitous emission features. The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on the James
Webb Space Telescope will detect these features from galaxies as far as
redshift z$\sim$1. We also investigate the behavior of the PAH band ratios and
find that subtracting the local background surrounding a star-forming region
decreases the ratio of PAH 11.3$\mu$m to 7.7$\mu$m emission. This implies PAHs
are more ionized in star-forming regions relative to their surroundings.

planetary growth by pebble accretion inside the ice line. The pebble flux is
computed self-consistently from dust growth by solving the advection-diffusion

and sublimation at the water iceline are included. The disc evolution is
computed for $\alpha$-discs with photoevaporation from the central star. The
planets grow from a moon-mass embryo by silicate pebble accretion and gas
accretion. We analyse the effect of a different initial disc mass,
$\alpha$-viscosity, disc metallicity and embryo location. Finally, we compute
atmospheric mass-loss due to evaporation. We find that inside the ice line, the
fragmentation barrier determines the size of pebbles, which leads to different
planetary growth patterns for different disc viscosities. Within the iceline
the pebble isolation mass typically decays to values below 5 M$_{\oplus}$
within the first million years of disc evolution, limiting the core masses to
that value. After computing atmospheric-mass loss, we find that planets with
cores below $\sim$4 M$_{\oplus}$ get their atmospheres completely stripped, and
a few 4-5 M$_{\oplus}$ cores retain a thin atmosphere that places them in the
gap/second peak of the Kepler size distribution. Overall, we find that rocky
planets form only in low-viscosity discs ($\alpha \lesssim 10^{-4}$). When
$\alpha \geq 10^{-3}$, rocky objects do not grow beyond Mars-mass. The most
typical outcome of dry pebble accretion is terrestrial planets with masses
spanning from Mars to $\sim$4 M$_{\oplus}$.

shown a number of outstanding properties. Here, we investigate defect evolution
and radiation tolerance of two MAB phases, MoAlB and Fe2AlB2, using a
combination of experimental characterization and first-principles calculations.
We find that Fe2AlB2 is more tolerant to radiation-induced amorphization than
MoAlB, both at 150 {\deg}C and at 300 {\deg}C. The results can be explained by
the fact that the Mo Frenkel pair is unstable in MoAlB and as a result,
irradiated MoAlB is expected to have a significant concentration of MoAl
antisites, which are difficult to anneal even at 300 {\deg}C. We find that the
tolerance to radiation-induced amorphization of MAB phases is lower than in MAX
phases, but it is comparable to that of SiC. However, MAB phases do not show
radiation-induced cracking which is observed in MAX phases under the same
irradiation conditions. This study suggests that MAB phases might be a
promising class of materials for applications that involve radiation.

physiological signal is a burning research topic in biomedical signal
processing. However, existing literature provides only binary assessment of
stress, while multiple levels of assessment may be more beneficial for
healthcare applications. Furthermore, in present research, ECG signal for
stress analysis is examined independently in spatial domain or in transform
domains but the advantage of fusing these domains has not been fully utilized.
To get the maximum advantage of fusing diferent domains, we introduce a dataset
with multiple stress levels and then classify these levels using a novel deep
learning approach by converting ECG signal into signal images based on R-R
peaks without any feature extraction. Moreover, We made signal images
multimodal and multidomain by converting them into time-frequency and frequency
domain using Gabor wavelet transform (GWT) and Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
respectively. Convolutional Neural networks (CNNs) are used to extract features
from different modalities and then decision level fusion is performed for
improving the classification accuracy. The experimental results on an in-house
dataset collected with 15 users show that with proposed fusion framework and
using ECG signal to image conversion, we reach an average accuracy of 85.45%.

contains all complete graphs. Recently, a class of (even-hole, $K_4$)-free
graphs was constructed, that still has unbounded tree-width [Sintiari and
Trotignon, 2019]. The class has unbounded degree and contains arbitrarily large
clique-minors. We ask whether this is necessary.
  We prove that for every graph $G$, if $G$ excludes a fixed graph $H$ as a
minor, then $G$ either has small tree-width, or $G$ contains a large wall or
the line graph of a large wall as induced subgraph. This can be seen as a
strengthening of Robertson and Seymour's excluded grid theorem for the case of
minor-free graphs. Our theorem implies that every class of even-hole-free
graphs excluding a fixed graph as a minor has bounded tree-width. In fact, our
theorem applies to a more general class: (theta, prism)-free graphs. This
implies the known result that planar even hole-free graph have bounded
tree-width [da Silva and Linhares Sales, Discrete Applied Mathematics 2010].
  We conjecture that even-hole-free graphs of bounded degree have bounded
tree-width. If true, this would mean that even-hole-freeness is testable in the
bounded-degree graph model of property testing. We prove the conjecture for
subcubic graphs and we give a bound on the tree-width of the class of (even
hole, pyramid)-free graphs of degree at most 4.

the results of a paired comparison experiment that investigates the effects of

perceived as nearer than dark colors for a high-fidelity, simple 3D object,

other color. These effects were not observed for a low-fidelity version of the

adoption of self-driving networks. However, network operators or home-network

Intent-based networking (IBN) allows operators to specify high-level policies
that dictate how the network should behave without worrying how they are
translated into configuration commands in the network devices. However, the
existing research proposals for IBN fail to exploit the knowledge and feedback
from the network operator to validate or improve the translation of intents. In
this paper, we introduce a novel intent-refinement process that uses machine
learning and feedback from the operator to translate the operator's utterances
into network configurations. Our refinement process uses a sequence-to-sequence
learning model to extract intents from natural language and the feedback from
the operator to improve learning. The key insight of our process is an
intermediate representation that resembles natural language that is suitable to
collect feedback from the operator but is structured enough to facilitate
precise translations. Our prototype interacts with a network operator using
natural language and translates the operator input to the intermediate
representation before translating to SDN rules. Our experimental results show
that our process achieves a correlation coefficient squared (i.e., R-squared)

formulate the problem as the maximization of individual offloading throughput,

iteratively solved. Simulation results demonstrate the convergence of our

goal of this work is to provide insights into the existence of the Radius
Valley from, first, a pure formation point of view, and second, a combined
formation-evolution model. We run global planet formation simulations including
the evolution of dust by coagulation, drift and fragmentation; and the
evolution of the gaseous disc by viscous accretion and photoevaporation. A
planet grows from a moon-mass embryo by either silicate or icy pebble
accretion, depending on its position with respect to the water ice line. We
account for gas accretion and type-I/II migration. We perform an extensive
parameter study evaluating a wide range in disc properties and embryo's initial
location. We account for photoevaporation driven mass-loss after formation. We
find that due to the change in dust properties at the water ice line, rocky
cores form typically with $\sim$3 M$_{\oplus}$ and have a maximum mass of
$\sim$5 M$_{\oplus}$, while icy cores peak at $\sim$10 $M_{\oplus}$, with
masses lower than 5 M$_{\oplus}$ being scarce. When neglecting the gaseous
envelope, rocky and icy cores account naturally for the two peaks of the Kepler
size distribution. The presence of massive envelopes for cores more massive
than $\sim$10 M$_{\oplus}$ inflates the radii of those planets above 4
R$_{\oplus}$. While the first peak of the Kepler size distribution is
undoubtedly populated by bare rocky cores, the second peak can host water-rich
planets with thin H-He atmospheres. Some envelope-loss mechanism should operate
efficiently at short orbital periods to explain the presence of $\sim$10-40
M$_{\oplus}$ planets falling in the second peak of the size distribution.

co-training as a semi-supervised learning method for self-labeling objects in

domain shift; in particular, when we have automatically generated virtual-world
images with object bounding boxes and we have real-world images which are
unlabeled. Moreover, we are particularly interested in using co-training for
deep object detection in the context of driver assistance systems and/or

waves within a flux tube with a known driver and atmospheric parameters. We
invert the Stokes profiles for the 6301 $\unicode{0xc5}$ and 6302
$\unicode{0xc5}$ line pair emergent from the simulations using the well-known
Stokes Inversions from Response functions (SIR) code to see if the atmospheric

original input spectra, even with asymmetries introduced in the spectra from
wave propagation in the atmosphere. The output models from the inversions match
closely to the simulations in temperature, line-of-sight magnetic field and
line-of-sight velocity within typical formation heights of the inverted lines.
Deviations from the simulations are seen away from these height regions. The
inversion results are less accurate during passage of the waves within the line
formation region. The original wave period could be recovered from the
atmosphere output by the inversions, with empirical mode decomposition
performing better than the wavelet approach in this task.

the corresponding potential is invariant under linear symmetry transforms such

scattering conditions do not respect the symmetries of the potential and there
is no systematic way to predetermine their imprint on the scattered wave field.
Here we show that symmetry induced, non-local, divergence-free currents can be
a useful tool for the description of the consequences of symmetries on higher
dimensional wave scattering, focusing on the two-dimensional case. The
condition of a vanishing divergence of these non-local currents, being in
one-to-one correspondence with the presence of a symmetry in the scattering
potential, provides a systematic pathway to to take account if the symmetries
in the scattering solution. It leads to a description of the scattering process
which is valid in the entire space including the near field regime.
Furthermore, we argue that the usual asymptotic representation of the
scattering wave function does not account for insufficient account for a proper
description of the underlying potential symmetries. Within our approach we
derive symmetry induced conditions for the coefficients in the wave field
expansion with respect to the angular momentum basis in two dimensions, which
determine the transition probabilities between different angular momentum

orientation, leading to the formation of large-scale ordered structures,
including topological defects and microdomains. These structures may benefit
bacterial strains, providing invasive advantages during colonization. Active
matter dynamics of growing colonies drives the emergence of these ordered
structures. However, additional biomechanical factors also play a significant
role during this process. Here we show that the velocity profile of growing
colonies creates strong radial orientation during inward growth when crowded
populations invade a closed area. During this process, growth geometry sets
virtual confinement and dictates the velocity profile. Herein, flow-induced
alignment and torque balance on the rod-shaped bacteria significantly differed,
resulting in new stable orientational equilibrium in the radial direction. Our
analysis revealed that the dynamics of these orientational defects depend on
bacterial length and can promote the survival of the longest bacteria around
localized nutritional hot spots. The present results indicate a new mechanism
underlying structural order and provide mechanistic insights into the dynamics
of bacterial growth on complex surfaces.

causality and passivity have played in various areas of physics and
engineering, including in the modern field of metamaterials. The aim is not to
provide a comprehensive list of references as that number would be in the
thousands, but to review the major results and contributions which have
animated these areas and to provide a unified framework from which to
understand the developments in different fields. Towards these goals, we chart
the early history of the field through its dual beginnings in the analysis of
the Sellmeier equation and in Hilbert transforms, giving rise to the far
reaching dispersion relations in the early works of Kramers, Kronig, and
Titchmarsh. However, these early relations constitute a limited result as they
only apply to a restricted class of transfer functions. To understand how this
restriction can be lifted, we take a quick detour into the distributional
analysis of Schwartz. This approach expands the reach of the dispersion
analysis to distributional transfer functions and also to those functions which
exhibit polynomial growth properties. To generalize the results even further to
tensorial transfer functions, we consider the concept of passivity - originally
studied in the theory of electrical networks. We clarify why passivity implies
causality. Subsequently, as special cases, we present examples of dispersion
relations from several areas of physics including electromagnetism, acoustics,
seismology, reflectance measurements, and scattering theory. We discuss sum
rules, derivative analyticity relations, and nearly local approximations.
Finally we review the clever applications of ideas from causality and passivity
to the recent field of metamaterials. These ideas have provided limits to what
can be achieved in metamaterial property design and metamaterial device
performance.

planetary systems. Recent works have shown that giant planet growth and
migration can shape the asteroid belt, but these works have not considered
interactions between planetesimals. We have calculated the evolution of
planetesimal disks, including planetesimal-planetesimal collisions, during gas
giant growth and migration. The numbers, locations, and impact velocities of
these collisions depend on the specific growth and migration path. We find that
giant planet growth alone has little effect on impact velocities, and most of
the planetesimals scattered by growing giants do not undergo collisions with
each other during the growth period. In contrast, we find that giant planet
migration induces large numbers of high velocity collisions between
planetesimals. These impacts have sufficient velocities to cause shock-induced
vaporization for both water ice and silicate components of planetesimals, and
to cause catastrophic disruption of the bodies. New bodies may form from impact
debris. Collisional evolution reduces the efficiency of planetesimal
implantation into the asteroid belt via giant planet growth and migration. A
small fraction of the largest planetesimals implanted into the asteroid belt
would have been processed via collisions. We identify important consequences of
planetesimal collisions that have not been considered in planet accretion
models. The prevalence of high velocity collisions during giant planet
migration, and their potential links to the properties of meteorites, and the
formation of chondrules, makes impact vaporization a critically important
phenomenon. The consequences of vaporizing planetesimal constituents require
further detailed study. New collision outcome models for impacts within the
nebula, and models for new planetesimal formation are needed.

confidentiality and the time required for expert manual annotation. Therefore,
being able to train models incrementally without having access to previously
used data is desirable. A common form of sequential training is fine tuning
(FT). In this setting, a model learns a new task effectively, but loses
performance on previously learned tasks. The Learning without Forgetting (LwF)
approach addresses this issue via replaying its own prediction for past tasks
during model training. In this work, we evaluate FT and LwF for class
incremental learning in multi-organ segmentation using the publicly available
AAPM dataset. We show that LwF can successfully retain knowledge on previous
segmentations, however, its ability to learn a new class decreases with the
addition of each class. To address this problem we propose an adversarial
continual learning segmentation approach (ACLSeg), which disentangles feature
space into task-specific and task-invariant features. This enables preservation
of performance on past tasks and effective acquisition of new knowledge.

Lagrangians, which form a new family of null Lagrangians. The conditions
required for the action to be invariant are derived for all null Lagrangians
presented in this paper, thus, making them exact. As a specific application,
the exact null Lagrangians are derived for a second-order ordinary differential
equation. The application shows that the exact null Lagrangians can be obtained
for any ordinary differential equation with known Lagrangian.

find evidence that the formula currently used by NICER can be used in the
inference of the radii of rapidly rotating stars, outside of the formula's

While a good amount of work has been performed on mammography image
classification, especially with deep neural networks, there has not been much
exploration into the confidence or uncertainty measurement of the

metric for breast cancer screening. We propose a modular network architecture,
where a traditional neural network is used as a feature extractor with transfer
learning, followed by a simple Bayesian neural network. Utilizing a two-stage
approach helps reducing the computational complexity, making the proposed
framework attractive for wider deployment. We show that by providing the
medical practitioners with a tool to tune two hyperparameters of the Bayesian
neural network, namely, fraction of sampled number of networks and minimum
probability, the framework can be adapted as needed by the domain expert.
Finally, we argue that instead of just a single number such as accuracy, a
tuple (accuracy, coverage, sampled number of networks, and minimum probability)
can be utilized as an evaluation metric of our framework. We provide
experimental results on the CBIS-DDSM dataset, where we show the trends in
accuracy-coverage tradeoff while tuning the two hyperparameters. We also show
that our confidence tuning results in increased accuracy with a reduced set of
images with high confidence when compared to the baseline transfer learning. To

interactions are often lack of naturalness and physical plausibility. Our key
observation is that humans interact with the world through body-scene contact.
To synthesize realistic human-scene interactions, it is essential to
effectively represent the physical contact and proximity between the body and
the world. To that end, we propose a novel interaction generation method, named
PLACE (Proximity Learning of Articulation and Contact in 3D Environments),
which explicitly models the proximity between the human body and the 3D scene
around it. Specifically, given a set of basis points on a scene mesh, we
leverage a conditional variational autoencoder to synthesize the minimum
distances from the basis points to the human body surface. The generated
proximal relationship exhibits which region of the scene is in contact with the
person. Furthermore, based on such synthesized proximity, we are able to
effectively obtain expressive 3D human bodies that interact with the 3D scene
naturally. Our perceptual study shows that PLACE significantly improves the
state-of-the-art method, approaching the realism of real human-scene
interaction. We believe our method makes an important step towards the fully
automatic synthesis of realistic 3D human bodies in 3D scenes. The code and

that Self-Path improves domain adaptation for classification of histology image

fundamental to understand the evolution of massive stars. Special interest has
been given to the range of initial masses of their progenitors, but despite the
efforts made, it is still uncertain. Direct imaging of progenitors in
pre-explosion images point out an upper initial mass cutoff of
$\sim$18$M_{\odot}$. However, this is in tension with previous studies in which
progenitor masses inferred by light curve modelling tend to favour high-mass
solutions. Moreover, it has been argued that light curve modelling alone cannot
provide a unique solution for the progenitor and explosion properties of SNe
II. We develop a robust method which helps us to constrain the physical
parameters of SNe II by fitting simultaneously their bolometric light curve and
the evolution of the photospheric velocity to hydrodynamical models using
statistical inference techniques. Pre-supernova red supergiant models were
created using the stellar evolution code MESA, varying the initial progenitor
mass. The explosion of these progenitors was then processed through
hydrodynamical simulations, where the explosion energy, synthesised nickel
mass, and the latter's spatial distribution within the ejecta were changed. We
compare to observations via Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. We apply this
method to a well-studied set of SNe with an observed progenitor in
pre-explosion images and compare with results in the literature. Progenitor
mass constraints are found to be consistent between our results and those
derived by pre-SN imaging and the analysis of late-time spectral modelling. We
have developed a robust method to infer progenitor and explosion properties of
SN II progenitors which is consistent with other methods in the literature,
which suggests that hydrodynamical modelling is able to accurately constrain
physical properties of SNe II.

is not confounded with any possible effects of covariates. However, covariate
imbalance often exists, because the experiment is carried out based on a single
realization of the complete randomization. It is more likely to occur and
worsen when the size of the experimental units is small or moderate. In this
paper, we introduce a new covariate balancing criterion, which measures the
differences between kernel density estimates of the covariates of treatment
groups. To achieve covariate balance before the treatments are randomly
assigned, we partition the experimental units by minimizing the criterion, then
randomly assign the treatment levels to the partitioned groups. Through

$3800 \pm 100~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $2300 \pm
200~\mathrm{km}~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for Blobs A and B, respectively. Since a dense
molecular clump is located close to Blob B, its slower velocity is attributed
to shock deceleration as a result of a shock-cloud interaction. This result
provides solid evidence that the forward shock of RX J1713.7$-$3946 is indeed
colliding with dense gas discovered through radio observations reported in the
literature. The locations and velocity differences of the two blobs lead to an
estimate that the shock encountered with the dense gas $\sim 100~\mathrm{yr}$
ago. The shock velocities, together with cutoff energies of the synchrotron
X-ray spectra of the blobs, indicate that particle acceleration in these
regions is close to the Bohm limit. Blob B, in particular, is almost at the
limit, accelerating particles at the fastest possible rate. We discuss possible
influence of the shock-cloud interaction on the efficiency of particle
acceleration.

exploiting the ring structure of this system, it is shown that velocity
perturbations impacting any vehicle on the ring enter an uncontrollable and
marginally stable mode defined by the sum of relative vehicle spacings. These
disturbances are then integrated up by the system and cannot be unwound via
controlling the autonomous vehicle. In particular, if the velocity disturbances
are zero-mean Gaussians, then the traffic flow on the ring will undergo a
random walk with the variance growing indefinitely and independently of the

benign as these disturbances do no enter the uncontrollable mode, meaning that
they can be easily regulated using the autonomous vehicle. Our results support

interferometer. However, it can be challenging to develop physical intuition
about what a particular interferometer is actually measuring or about whether a
given classical measurement provides equivalent information. Here we
investigate the physical content of the interferometer phase through a series
of thought experiments. In low-order potentials, a matter-wave interferometer
with a single internal state provides the same information as a sum of position
measurements of a classical test object. In high-order potentials, the
interferometer phase becomes decoupled from the motion of the interferometer
arms, and the phase contains information that cannot be obtained by any set of
position measurements on the interferometer trajectory. This phase shift in a
high-order potential fundamentally distinguishes matter-wave interferometers
from classical measuring devices.

are developed in this work to enable the stable hovering and deformation.
Furthermore, the state estimation which involves the time synchronization
between sensors and the multilinked kinematics is also presented in this work
to enable the fully autonomous flight in the outdoor environment. Various
autonomous outdoor experiments, including the fast maneuvering for interception
with target, object grasping for delivery, and blanket manipulation for
firefighting are performed to evaluate the feasibility and versatility of the
proposed robot platform. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study
for the multilinked aerial robot to achieve the fully autonomous flight and the

may help to reveal the origin of the ""super-Chandrasekhar"" (or 03fg-like)
group. The optical spectrum is typical of a 03fg-like SN Ia, but the light
curves are unlike those of any SNe Ia observed. The light curves of LSQ14fmg
rise extremely slowly. At -23 rest-frame days relative to B-band maximum,
LSQ14fmg is already brighter than $M_V$=-19 mag before host extinction
correction. The observed color curves show a flat evolution from the earliest
observation to approximately one week after maximum. The near-infrared light
curves peak brighter than -20.5 mag in the J and H bands, far more luminous
than any 03fg-like SNe Ia with near-infrared observations. At one month past
maximum, the optical light curves decline rapidly. The early, slow rise and
flat color evolution are interpreted to result from an additional excess flux
from a power source other than the radioactive decay of the synthesized
$^{56}Ni$. The excess flux matches the interaction with a typical superwind of
an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star in density structure, mass-loss rate, and
duration. The rapid decline starting at around one month past B-band maximum
may be an indication of rapid cooling by active carbon monoxide (CO) formation,
which requires a low temperature and high density environment. These
peculiarities point to an AGB progenitor near the end of its evolution and the
core degenerate scenario as the likely explosion mechanism for LSQ14fmg.

the Universe and often exhibit strong accretion activities and powerful jets.
These SMBH mergers are also promising candidates for future gravitational wave
detectors such as Laser Space Inteferometric Antenna (LISA). In this work, we
consider neutrino counterpart emission originating from the jet-induced shocks.
The physical picture is that relativistic jets launched after the merger will
push forward inside the premerger disk wind material, and then they
subsequently get collimated, leading to the formation of internal shocks,
collimation shocks, forward shocks and reverse shocks. Cosmic rays can be
accelerated in these sites and neutrinos are expected via the photomeson
production process. We formulate the jet structures and relevant interactions
therein, and then evaluate neutrino emission from each shock site. We find that
month-to-year high-energy neutrino emission from the postmerger jet after the
gravitational wave event is detectable by IceCube-Gen2 within approximately
five to ten years of operation in optimistic cases where the cosmic-ray loading
is sufficiently high and a mildly super-Eddington accretion is achieved. We
also estimate the contribution of SMBH mergers to the diffuse neutrino
intensity, and find that a significant fraction of the observed very
high-energy ($E_\nu\gtrsim1$ PeV) IceCube neutrinos could originate from them
in the optimistic cases. In the future, such neutrino counterparts together
with gravitational wave observations can be used in a multimessenger approach
to elucidate in greater detail the evolution and the physical mechanism of SMBH

are studied by density functional theory (DFT). It is found that the increasing
strain can reduce the elastic coefficient $C_{11}$-$C_{12}$, and increases
piezoelectric stress coefficient $e_{11}$, which lead to the enhanced
piezoelectric strain coefficient $d_{11}$. Compared to unstrained one, strain
of 4\% can raise the $d_{11}$ by about 330\%. From -4\% to 4\%, strain can
induce the improved ionic contribution to $e_{11}$ of g-$\mathrm{C_3N_4}$, and
almost unchanged electronic contribution, which is different from
$\mathrm{MoS_2}$ monolayer (the enhanced electronic contribution and reduced

frequency is a Nyquist alias. The revised pulsation frequency is $191.5151 \pm

0.00005$d$^{-1}$ ($P_{\rm rot} = 3.1028$d). The star is an oblique pulsator
with pulsation amplitude modulated by the rotation, reaching pulsation
amplitude maximum at the time of the rotational light minimum. The oblique
pulsation generates a frequency quintuplet split by exactly the rotation
frequency. The phases of sidelobes, the pulsation phase modulation, and a
spherical harmonic decomposition all show this star to be pulsating in a
distorted quadrupole mode. Following the oblique pulsator model, we calculated
the rotation inclination $i$ and magnetic oblique $\beta$ of this star, which
provide detailed information of pulsation geometry. The $i$ and $\beta$ derived
by the best fit of pulsation amplitude and phase modulation through a
theoretical model differ from those calculated for a pure quadrupole,
indicating the existence of strong magnetic distortion. The model also predicts
the polar magnetic field strength is as high as about 6kG which is predicted to
be observed in a high resolution spectrum of this star.

  Adversaries",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Cyber deception is one of the key approaches used to mislead attackers by
hiding or providing inaccurate system information. There are two main factors
limiting the real-world application of existing cyber deception approaches. The
first limitation is that the number of systems in a network is assumed to be
fixed. However, in the real world, the number of systems may be dynamically
changed. The second limitation is that attackers' strategies are simplified in
the literature. However, in the real world, attackers may be more powerful than
theory suggests. To overcome these two limitations, we propose a novel
differentially private game theoretic approach to cyber deception. In this
proposed approach, a defender adopts differential privacy mechanisms to
strategically change the number of systems and obfuscate the configurations of
systems, while an attacker adopts a Bayesian inference approach to infer the
real configurations of systems. By using the differential privacy technique,
the proposed approach can 1) reduce the impacts on network security resulting
from changes in the number of systems and 2) resist attacks regardless of
attackers' reasoning power. The experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.

requiring fewer input files and shuffle groups. The FLCD scheme is the first
proposed low-complexity CDC design that can operate on a network with an
arbitrary number of nodes and computation load. We perform empirical

that introduces non-Markovian effects in the standard (Markovian) Majority-Vote
model (SMV). The SMV model is one of the simplest two-state stochastic models
for studying opinion dynamics, and displays a continuous order-disorder phase
transition at a critical noise. In the NMMV model we assume that the
probability that an agent changes state is not only dependent on the majority
state of his neighbors but it also depends on his {\em age}, i.e. how long the
agent has been in his current state. The NMMV model has two regimes: the aging
regime implies that the probability that an agent changes state is decreasing
with his age, while in the anti-aging regime the probability that an agent
changes state is increasing with his age. Interestingly, we find that the
critical noise at which we observe the order-disorder phase transition is a
non-monotonic function of the rate $\beta$ of the aging (anti-aging) process.
In particular the critical noise in the aging regime displays a maximum as a
function of $\beta$ while in the anti-aging regime displays a minimum. This
implies that the aging/anti-aging dynamics can retard/anticipate the transition
and that there is an optimal rate $\beta$ for maximally perturbing the value of
the critical noise. The analytical results obtained in the framework of the
heterogeneous mean-field approach are validated by extensive numerical
simulations on a large variety of network topologies.

show that the observational properties of FRB 200428 and the associated XRB are
consistent with the predictions of synchrotron maser emission at
ultrarelativistic magnetized shocks, including radiation efficiency, similar
energy occurrence frequency distributions, and simultaneous arrive times. It
requires that the upstream medium is a mildly relativistic baryonic shell
ejected by a previous flare. The energy injection by flares responsible for the
radio bursts will produce a magnetar wind nebula, which has been used to
explain the persistent radio source associated FRB 121102. We find that the
radio continuum around SGR 1935+2154 can be well understood in the magnetar
wind nebula model, by assuming the same energy injection rate $\dot{E} \propto
t^{-1.37}$ as FRB 121102. The required baryonic mass is also estimated form the
observations of FRB 121102 by GBT and FAST. By assuming the same radiation
efficiency $\eta \sim 10^{-5}$, the total baryonic mass ejected from the
central magnetar is about 0.005 solar mass. This value is much larger than the
typical mass of a magnetar outer crust, but is comparable to the total mass of

few centuries, and particularly during the Space Age. The nagging suspicion of
extant Martian life is both fed by, and drives the many space missions to Mars
and recent detections of large, seasonal volumes of atmospheric methane have
re-fuelled the discussion. Methane's strongest vibrational frequency (around
3.3 micron) occurs in the lower half of astronomers' L Band in the near infra
red, and is readily detectable in the Martian atmosphere from ground based
spectroscopes at high, dry locations such as Hawaii and Chile. However,
resolution of specific spectral absorption lines that categorically identify
methane are disputed in the literature, as are their origins. With the proposed
construction of extremely large telescopes operating in the optical/NIR, the
question became: could these ELTs supplement, or even replace space-based
instruments trained on Martian methane? A 2012 review of immediate-past,
present and future NIR spectrometers on Earth, in the air, in Earth orbit, in
solar orbit, in L2 orbit, in Mars orbit, and on Mars, revealed a wide range of
capabilities and limitations. Spatial, spectral, radiometric and temporal
resolutions were all considered and found to be complex, inter-related and
highly instrument-specific. The Giant Magellan Telescope, the Thirty Meter
Telescope and the European Extremely Large Telescope will each have at least
one L Band spectrometer supported by state-of-the-art adaptive optics and be
capable of extreme spatial, spectral and radiometric resolution. Replicating
observations over time will provide a critical constraint to theoretical
considerations about the biotic or abiotic origins of any detected methane and
it is recommended that existing datasets be mined, science cases for the ELTs

concerned with checking which temporal logic properties will hold in a system

Unfortunately, rational verification is computationally complex, and requires

In this paper, we present such a technique. This technique relies on a
reduction of the rational verification problem to the solution of a collection
of parity games. Our approach has been implemented in the Equilibrium
Verification Environment (EVE) system. The EVE system takes as input a model of
a concurrent/multi-agent system represented using the Simple Reactive Modules
Language (SRML), where agent goals are represented as Linear Temporal Logic
(LTL) formulae, together with a claim about the equilibrium behaviour of the
system, also expressed as an LTL formula. EVE can then check whether the LTL
claim holds on some (or every) computation of the system that could arise
through agents choosing Nash equilibrium strategies; it can also check whether
a system has a Nash equilibrium, and synthesise individual strategies for
players in the multi-player game. After presenting our basic framework, we
describe our new technique and prove its correctness. We then describe our
implementation in the EVE system, and present experimental results which show
that EVE performs favourably in comparison to other existing tools that support
rational verification.

multi-turn dialogue generation. Previous works usually employ various neural
network architectures (e.g., recurrent neural networks, attention mechanisms,

study by Sankar et al. has shown that these architectures lack the ability of
understanding and modeling the dynamics of the dialogue history. For example,
the widely used architectures are insensitive to perturbations of the dialogue
history, such as words shuffling, utterances missing, and utterances
reordering. To tackle this problem, we propose a Ranking Enhanced Dialogue
generation framework in this paper. Despite the traditional representation
encoder and response generation modules, an additional ranking module is
introduced to model the ranking relation between the former utterance and
consecutive utterances. Specifically, the former utterance and consecutive
utterances are treated as query and corresponding documents, and both local and
global ranking losses are designed in the learning process. In this way, the
dynamics in the dialogue history can be explicitly captured. To evaluate our
proposed models, we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets,
i.e., bAbI, PersonaChat, and JDC. Experimental results show that our models
produce better responses in terms of both quantitative measures and human
judgments, as compared with the state-of-the-art dialogue generation models.

of parameter values in all the scaling regimes. The value of the des Cloizeaux
exponent proposed by Dobrynin for sticky polymer solutions, is shown to lead to
a collapse of simulation data for all the scaling relations considered here.
Three different signatures for the characterisation of gelation are identified,
with each leading to a different value of the concentration at the sol-gel

by simulations for all three gelation signatures. Simulation results confirm
the prediction of scaling theory for the gelation line that separates sol and

\pi} + o_{n,d}(1)\right)/\sqrt d$, where $2\sqrt{\frac 2 \pi} = 1.595\ldots$
and $o_{n,d}(1)$ denotes an error term that depends on $n$ and $d$ and goes to
zero if we first take the limit $n\rightarrow \infty$ and then the limit $d
\rightarrow \infty$.
  This is established by analyzing linear-size cuts using techniques of
Jagannath and Sen derived from ideas in statistical physics, and analyzing
small cuts via martingale inequalities.
  We also prove new lower bounds on spectral sparsification of the clique. If
$G$ is a spectral sparsifier of the clique and $G$ has average degree $d$, we
prove that the approximation error is at least the ""Ramanujan bound''
$(2-o_{n,d}(1))/\sqrt d$, which is met by $d$-regular Ramanujan graphs,
provided that either the weighted adjacency matrix of $G$ is a (multiple of) a
doubly stochastic matrix, or that $G$ satisfies a certain high ""odd
pseudo-girth"" property. The first case can be seen as an ""Alon-Boppana theorem
for symmetric doubly stochastic matrices,"" showing that a symmetric doubly
stochastic matrix with $dn$ non-zero entries has a non-trivial eigenvalue of
magnitude at least $(2-o_{n,d}(1))/\sqrt d$; the second case generalizes a
lower bound of Srivastava and Trevisan, which requires a large girth
assumption.
  Together, these results imply a separation between spectral sparsification
and cut sparsification. If $G$ is a random $\log n$-regular graph on $n$
vertices, we show that, with high probability, $G$ admits a (weighted subgraph)
cut sparsifier of average degree $d$ and approximation error at most
$(1.595\ldots + o_{n,d}(1))/\sqrt d$, while every (weighted subgraph) spectral
sparsifier of $G$ having average degree $d$ has approximation error at least
$(2-o_{n,d}(1))/\sqrt d$.

An estimating equation approach is proposed for the estimation of the model

performance than conventional signal processing methods. The existed DNNbased
models always handcrafted a fixed window to make use of the contextual speech

contextual speech information can't handle various unpredicatable noise
environments and highlight the critical speech information to VAD task. In
order to solve this problem, this paper proposed an adaptive multiple

the characteristic properties of supercohomology phases - namely, symmetry
fractionalization on fermion parity flux loops - predicted by continuum

extending the protecting symmetries, analogous to the construction of

community for its various real-world applications, such as diet management and

as for providing the benchmark dataset for such algorithms. To encourage
further progress in food recognition, we introduce the dataset ISIA Food- 500
with 500 categories from the list in the Wikipedia and 399,726 images, a more
comprehensive food dataset that surpasses existing popular benchmark datasets
by category coverage and data volume. Furthermore, we propose a stacked
global-local attention network, which consists of two sub-networks for food
recognition. One subnetwork first utilizes hybrid spatial-channel attention to
extract more discriminative features, and then aggregates these multi-scale
discriminative features from multiple layers into global-level representation
(e.g., texture and shape information about food). The other one generates
attentional regions (e.g., ingredient relevant regions) from different regions
via cascaded spatial transformers, and further aggregates these multi-scale
regional features from different layers into local-level representation. These
two types of features are finally fused as comprehensive representation for
food recognition. Extensive experiments on ISIA Food-500 and other two popular
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, and
thus can be considered as one strong baseline. The dataset, code and models can

with the phoneme sequence to reconstruct the mel-spectrum. Meanwhile, the
sematic features of text from the pre-trained language model is introduced to

modeled by the relative position matrices so that the position encodings is no

learning approach with performance highly competitive to deep neural networks

coding driven deep decision tree ensembles that we abbreviate as ScD2TE,
provides a new perspective on representation learning. We explore the
possibility of stacking several layers based on non-differentiable pairwise
modules and generate a densely concatenated architecture holding the
characteristics of feature map reuse and end-to-end dense learning. Under this
architecture, fast convolutional sparse coding is used to extract multi-level
features from the output of each layer. In this way, rich image appearance
models together with more contextual information are integrated by learning a
series of decision tree ensembles. The appearance and the high-level context
features of all the previous layers are seamlessly combined by concatenating
them to feed-forward as input, which in turn makes the outputs of subsequent
layers more accurate and the whole model efficient to train. Compared with deep
neural networks, our proposed ScD2TE does not require back-propagation
computation and depends on less hyper-parameters. ScD2TE is able to achieve a
fast end-to-end pixel-wise training in a layer-wise manner. We demonstrated the
superiority of our segmentation technique by evaluating it on the multi-disease

visual representations by constructing separate embedding spaces, each of which
is invariant to all but one augmentation. We use a multi-head network with a
shared backbone which captures information across each augmentation and alone
outperforms all baselines on downstream tasks. We further find that the

is based on the notion of feature binding, which is defined as the process by
which activation's spread across space and layers in the network are
successfully integrated to arrive at a correct inference decision. In our work,
this is accomplished for the task of dense image labelling by blending images
based on their class labels, and then training a feature binding network, which
simultaneously segments and separates the blended images. Subsequent feature
denoising to suppress noisy activations reveals additional desirable properties
and high degrees of successful predictions. Through this process, we reveal a
general mechanism, distinct from any prior methods, for boosting the
performance of the base segmentation network while simultaneously increasing
robustness to adversarial attacks.

market, hence an understanding of its nonequilibrium statistical mechanics is
of great importance to human society. For this aim, a simple and efficient
one-dimensional (1D) lattice gas automaton (LGA) is presented for wealth
distribution of agents with or without saving propensity. The LGA comprises two
stages, i.e., random propagation and economic transaction. During the former
phase, an agent either remains motionless or travels to one of its neighboring
empty sites with a certain probability. In the subsequent procedure, an
economic transaction takes place between a pair of neighboring agents randomly.
It requires at least 4 neighbors to present correct simulation results. The LGA
reduces to the simplest model with only random economic transaction if all
agents are neighbors and no empty sites exist. The 1D-LGA has a higher
computational efficiency than the 2D-LGA and the famous Chakraborti-Chakrabarti
economic model. Finally, the LGA is validated with two benchmarks, i.e., the
wealth distributions of individual agents and dual-earner families. With the
increasing saving fraction, both the Gini coefficient and Kolkata index (for
individual agents or two-earner families) reduce, while the deviation degree
(defined to measure the difference between the probability distributions with
and without saving propensities) increases. It is demonstrated that the wealth
distribution is changed significantly by the saving propensity which alleviates
wealth inequality.

Dyck paths with respect to the number of symmetric valleys and the sum of their
widths, which provides an unexpected connection between symmetric valleys and
statistics on ordered rooted trees. Finally, we enumerate Dyck paths whose peak

introducing a new concept of texture mosaic images. Instead of optimizing a

systems, such as display advertising and recommender systems. Recently,
modeling user behavior sequences attracts much attention and shows great
improvements in the CTR field. Existing works mainly exploit attention
mechanism based on embedding product when considering relations between user

semantics and overlooks the underlying reasons driving a user to click on a
target item. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Multiplex
Target-Behavior Relation enhanced Network (MTBRN) to leverage multiplex
relations between user behaviors and target item to enhance CTR prediction.
Multiplex relations consist of meaningful semantics, which can bring a better
understanding on users' interests from different perspectives. To explore and
model multiplex relations, we propose to incorporate various graphs (e.g.,
knowledge graph and item-item similarity graph) to construct multiple
relational paths between user behaviors and target item. Then Bi-LSTM is
applied to encode each path in the path extractor layer. A path fusion network
and a path activation network are devised to adaptively aggregate and finally
learn the representation of all paths for CTR prediction. Extensive offline and

large number of object categories with a long-tailed data distribution remains
a challenging problem and is less investigated. For a large-vocabulary
classifier, the chance of obtaining noisy logits is much higher, which can
easily lead to a wrong recognition. In this paper, we exploit prior knowledge
of the relations among object categories to cluster fine-grained classes into
coarser parent classes, and construct a classification tree that is responsible
for parsing an object instance into a fine-grained category via its parent
class. In the classification tree, as the number of parent class nodes are
significantly less, their logits are less noisy and can be utilized to suppress
the wrong/noisy logits existed in the fine-grained class nodes. As the way to
construct the parent class is not unique, we further build multiple trees to
form a classification forest where each tree contributes its vote to the
fine-grained classification. To alleviate the imbalanced learning caused by the
long-tail phenomena, we propose a simple yet effective resampling method, NMS
Resampling, to re-balance the data distribution. Our method, termed as Forest
R-CNN, can serve as a plug-and-play module being applied to most object
recognition models for recognizing more than 1000 categories. Extensive
experiments are performed on the large vocabulary dataset LVIS. Compared with
the Mask R-CNN baseline, the Forest R-CNN significantly boosts the performance

signal is still evident, while the 2-halo conformity signal is reduced to a
very weak amplitude. Our results confirm the previous study in the optical band
that the 2-halo term is possibly caused by the bias effect in the sample
selection. Furthermore, we confirm the existence of the 1-halo conformity
discovered in the optical and radio band in previous lectures. Our results

incorporate triple modular redundancy (TMR) to embed fault tolerance in their
physical implementations. In a TMR realization, an original function block,
which may be a circuit or a system, and two exact copies of the function block
are used to successfully overcome any temporary fault or permanent failure of
an arbitrary function block during the routine operation. The corresponding
outputs of the function blocks are majority voted using 3-input majority voters
whose outputs define the outputs of a TMR realization. Hence, a 3-input
majority voter forms an important component of a TMR realization. Many
synchronous majority voters and an asynchronous non-delay insensitive majority
voter have been presented in the literature. Recently, quasi delay insensitive
(QDI) asynchronous majority voters for TMR applications were also discussed in
the literature. In this regard, this paper presents a new QDI asynchronous
majority voter for TMR applications, which is better optimized in area compared
to the existing QDI majority voters. The proposed QDI majority voter requires
30.2% less area compared to the best of the existing QDI majority voters, and
this could be useful for resource-constrained fault tolerance applications. The
example QDI TMR circuits were implemented using a 32/28nm complementary metal
oxide semiconductor (CMOS) process. The delay insensitive dual rail code was
used for data encoding, and 4-phase return-to-zero and return-to-one handshake
protocols were used for data communication.

methods that can learn in a distributed manner without the data ever leaving
the local devices. In light of this need, federated learning has emerged as a
popular training paradigm. However, many federated learning approaches trade
transmitting data for communicating updated weight parameters for each local
device. Therefore, a successful breach that would have otherwise directly
compromised the data instead grants whitebox access to the local model, which
opens the door to a number of attacks, including exposing the very data
federated learning seeks to protect. Additionally, in distributed scenarios,
individual client devices commonly exhibit high statistical heterogeneity. Many
common federated approaches learn a single global model; while this may do well
on average, performance degrades when the i.i.d. assumption is violated,
underfitting individuals further from the mean, and raising questions of
fairness. To address these issues, we propose Weight Anonymized Factorization
for Federated Learning (WAFFLe), an approach that combines the Indian Buffet
Process with a shared dictionary of weight factors for neural networks.
Experiments on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10 demonstrate WAFFLe's
significant improvement to local test performance and fairness while
simultaneously providing an extra layer of security.

likely to be useful in the analysis of any data set whose volume is sufficient
to obscure a naked-eye view of its features. Unfortunately, such large data
sets are in short supply in the actuarial literature. Accordingly, one needs to
turn to synthetic data. Although the ultimate objective of these methods is
application to real data, the use of synthetic data containing features
commonly observed in real data is also to be encouraged.
  While there are a number of claims simulators in existence, each valuable

superimposed inflation, and various discontinuities, and also enables various
dependencies between variables. The user has full control of the mechanics of

$G_0W_0$ methods are found to be in good agreement with the experiment, whereas
mBJ underestimates the bandgap. The estimated value of fully screened Coulomb
interaction ($W$) for Sn (Te) 5$p$ orbitals is $\sim$1.39 ($\sim$1.70) eV. The
nature of frequency dependent $W$ reveals that the correlation strength of this
compound is relatively weaker and hence the excited electronic state can be
properly studied by full-$GW$ many-body technique. The plasmon excitation is
found to be important in understanding this frequency dependent $W$. In order
to describe the experimental phonon modes, the long range Coulomb forces using
nonanalytical term correction is considered. The temperature dependent
electron-electron interactions (EEI) reduces the bandgaps with increasing
temperature. The value of bandgap at 300 K is obtained to be $\sim$161 meV. The
temperature dependent lifetimes of electronic state along W-L-$\Gamma$

explain the high temperature transport behaviour of SnTe. We have also explored

systems contain many sensors and actuators that can communicate with each other

composed of a high-level controller that creates a virtual control input vector
and a low-level control allocator that distributes the virtual control effort
among redundant actuators. Virtual control input incorporates the required
traction force, yaw, pitch, and roll moment corrections, and the lateral force
correction to ensure stability while following a maneuvering reference
initiated by the driver. Based on the virtual control input vector, the
allocation module determines front steering angle correction, rear steering
angle, traction forces at each tire, and active suspension forces. The proposed
control framework distinguishes itself from earlier results in the literature
by its ability to adapt to failures and uncertainties by updating its
parameters online, without the need for fault identification. The control
structure is validated in the simulation environment using a fourteen degree of
freedom nonlinear vehicle model. Our results demonstrate that the proposed
approach ensures that the vehicle follows references created by the driver
despite the loss of actuator effectiveness up to 30% higher longitudinal
maneuver velocity and approximately 35% lower roll and pitch angles during
steering with representative driving scenarios.

a single remaining outer giant. In contrast to similar studies which used on
N-body simulations with specific (and limited) parameters or scenarios, we

between the outer planets prior to eventual ejection/merger. When
$N_{\mathrm{ej}}$ is small, the eventual evolution of the inner planets can be
well described by secular dynamics. For larger values of $N_{\mathrm{ej}}$, the
inner planets gain orbital inclination, inclination and eccentricity in a

made at cm-wavelengths where it is often not possible to uniquely identify the
emission mechanism, hindering the utility of radio observations in probing
coronal conditions. In anticipation of stellar observations from a suite of
sensitive low-frequency ($\nu\sim 10^2\,{\rm MHz}$) radio telescopes, here I
apply the general theory of coherent emission in non-relativistic plasma to the
low-frequency case. I consider the recently reported low-frequency emission

cases. My main conclusion is that unlike the cm-wave regime, for reasonable
turbulence saturation regimes, the emission mechanism in metre-wave
observations ($\nu\sim 10^2\,{\rm MHz}$) can often be identified based on the
observed brightness temperature, emission duration and polarisation fraction. I
arrive at the following heuristic: M-dwarf emission that is $\gtrsim
\,$hour-long with $\gtrsim 50\%$ circular polarised fraction at brightness
temperatures of $\gtrsim 10^{12}\,$K at $\sim 100\,{\rm MHz}$ in canonical

introduce an optimal selection strategy using reinforcement learning (RL). We
define an RL environment for image matching in which each individual action

time and its mass and redshift dependence in a large dynamic range. We further
provide a unified and accurate model validated across cosmic time, which can
serve as the initial condition for semi-analytic models. We find that the
infall velocity $v$ follows a nearly universal distribution peaked near the

the infall orbit is most radially biased when $v\sim V_{\mathrm{h}}$. Moreover,
subhalos that have a higher host mass or a higher sub-to-host ratio tend to
move along a more radial direction with a relatively smaller angular momentum

share the same normalized orbital energy. These relations are nearly
independent of the redshift when using the density peak height as the proxy for
host halo mass. The above trends are consistent with the scenario where the
dynamical environment is relatively colder for more massive structures because
their own gravity is more likely to dominate the local potentials. Based on
this understanding, the more massive or isolated halos are expected to have
higher velocity anisotropy.

learning requiring sufficient annotations. However, in real applications, a
pretrained pose estimation model usually need be adapted to a novel domain with
no labels or sparse labels. Such domain adaptation for 2D pose estimation
hasn't been explored. The main reason is that a pose, by nature, has typical
topological structure and needs fine-grained features in local keypoints. While
existing adaptation methods do not consider topological structure of
object-of-interest and they align the whole images coarsely. Therefore, we
propose a novel domain adaptation method for multi-person pose estimation to
conduct the human-level topological structure alignment and fine-grained
feature alignment. Our method consists of three modules: Cross-Attentive
Feature Alignment (CAFA), Intra-domain Structure Adaptation (ISA) and
Inter-domain Human-Topology Alignment (IHTA) module. The CAFA adopts a
bidirectional spatial attention module (BSAM)that focuses on fine-grained local
feature correlation between two humans to adaptively aggregate consistent
features for adaptation. We adopt ISA only in semi-supervised domain adaptation
(SSDA) to exploit the corresponding keypoint semantic relationship for reducing
the intra-domain bias. Most importantly, we propose an IHTA to learn more
domain-invariant human topological representation for reducing the inter-domain
discrepancy. We model the human topological structure via the graph convolution
network (GCN), by passing messages on which, high-order relations can be
considered. This structure preserving alignment based on GCN is beneficial to
the occluded or extreme pose inference. Extensive experiments are conducted on
two popular benchmarks and results demonstrate the competency of our method
compared with existing supervised approaches.

significantly on the nonlinear two-phonon loss of the vdP oscillator, where the
degree of the antibunching increases monotonically with the two-phonon loss and
the distinguished parameter regimes with optimal antibunching and single-phonon
emission are identified clearly. In addition, we give an in-depth insight into
strong antibunching in the emitted phonon statistics by analytical calculations
using a three-oscillator-level model, which agree well with the full numerical
simulations employing a master-equation approach and a Schrodinger-equation
approach at weak driving. In turn, the fluorescence phonon emission spectra of
the vdP oscillator, given by the power spectral density, are also evaluated. We
further show that high phonon emission amplitudes, simultaneously accompanied
by strong phonon antibunching, are attainable in the vdP system, which are
beneficial to the correlation measurement in practical experiments. Our
approach only requires a single vdP oscillator, without the need for
reconfiguring the two coupled nonlinear resonators or the complex nanophotonic

accuracy upon fine tuning. State of the art AL approaches typically rely on
measures of visual diversity or prediction uncertainty, which are unable to
effectively capture the variations in spatial context. On the other hand,
modern CNN architectures make heavy use of spatial context for achieving highly
accurate predictions. Since the context is difficult to evaluate in the absence
of ground-truth labels, we introduce the notion of contextual diversity that
captures the confusion associated with spatially co-occurring classes.
Contextual Diversity (CD) hinges on a crucial observation that the probability
vector predicted by a CNN for a region of interest typically contains
information from a larger receptive field. Exploiting this observation, we use
the proposed CD measure within two AL frameworks: (1) a core-set based strategy
and (2) a reinforcement learning based policy, for active frame selection. Our

sky, and great dry visibility, and the accuracy is 73.4%.Our study finds that
Beijing shares the most significant acceleration in the BTH region, with a
growth rate of 2.66 d/year. The greatest seasonal average and the maximum
acceleration rate appear in winter for total BBI and continuous BBI days, the
least is in summer, while Beijing blue appears most frequently in January. BBI
is more related to relative humidity and rainless day on an annual scale, but
different in different seasons.

For improved lesion localization, foreground/background separation is trained
through self-supervision, in such a way that occluding foreground pixels
transforms the input image into a healthy-looking image. The advantage of such
an architecture is that automatic diagnoses can be explained simply by an image

model predicts a subset of X-ray flares seen in some gamma-ray bursts. We can
further explain the diversity of X-ray plateaus by altering the radiative
efficiency and measure the braking index of newly-born millisecond magnetars.
We measure the braking index of GRB061121 as $n=4.85^{+0.11}_{-0.15}$
suggesting the millisecond-magnetar born in this gamma-ray burst spins down
predominantly through gravitational-wave emission.

  Roy-Chowdhury","Adversarial Knowledge Transfer from Unlabeled Data","Accepted to ACM Multimedia 2020",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  While machine learning approaches to visual recognition offer great promise,
most of the existing methods rely heavily on the availability of large
quantities of labeled training data. However, in the vast majority of
real-world settings, manually collecting such large labeled datasets is
infeasible due to the cost of labeling data or the paucity of data in a given
domain. In this paper, we present a novel Adversarial Knowledge Transfer (AKT)
framework for transferring knowledge from internet-scale unlabeled data to
improve the performance of a classifier on a given visual recognition task. The
proposed adversarial learning framework aligns the feature space of the
unlabeled source data with the labeled target data such that the target
classifier can be used to predict pseudo labels on the source data. An
important novel aspect of our method is that the unlabeled source data can be
of different classes from those of the labeled target data, and there is no
need to define a separate pretext task, unlike some existing approaches.
Extensive experiments well demonstrate that models learned using our approach
hold a lot of promise across a variety of visual recognition tasks on multiple
standard datasets.

calls for radically different measurement methods that do not suffer from
decreasing accuracy with the decreasing size of the system. For nanoelectric
devices in the state of Coulomb blockade, with only two energetically
accessible charge states, two purely electric, size-independent methods of
measuring the entropy difference between the charge states have been proposed:
through transport properties and charge balance measurements. We suggest a
self-consistent thermodynamic framework for the treatment of entropy in
Coulomb-blocked electric nanodevices which incorporates both existing entropy
measurement methods, generalises them, and expands to systems with arbitrarily

Odometry using Lines. Event cameras, also called Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVSs),
generate highly asynchronous streams of events triggered upon illumination
changes for each individual pixel. This novel paradigm presents advantages in
low illumination conditions and high-speed motions. Nonetheless, this
unconventional sensing modality brings new challenges to perform scene
reconstruction or motion estimation. The proposed method offers to leverage a
continuous-time representation of the inertial readings to associate each event
with timely accurate inertial data. The method's front-end extracts event
clusters that belong to line segments in the environment whereas the back-end
estimates the system's trajectory alongside the lines' 3D position by
minimizing point-to-line distances between individual events and the lines'
projection in the image space. A novel attraction/repulsion mechanism is
presented to accurately estimate the lines' extremities, avoiding their
explicit detection in the event data. The proposed method is benchmarked
against a state-of-the-art frame-based visual-inertial odometry framework using
public datasets. The results show that IDOL performs at the same order of
magnitude on most datasets and even shows better orientation estimates. These
findings can have a great impact on new algorithms for DVS.

significantly less training time than RNN-based models. The original
Transformer, with encoder-decoder architecture, is only suitable for offline
ASR. It relies on an attention mechanism to learn alignments, and encodes input
audio bidirectionally. The high computation cost of Transformer decoding also
limits its use in production streaming systems. To make Transformer suitable
for streaming ASR, we explore Transducer framework as a streamable way to learn
alignments. For audio encoding, we apply unidirectional Transformer with
interleaved convolution layers. The interleaved convolution layers are used for
modeling future context which is important to performance. To reduce
computation cost, we gradually downsample acoustic input, also with the
interleaved convolution layers. Moreover, we limit the length of history
context in self-attention to maintain constant computation cost for each
decoding step. We show that this architecture, named Conv-Transformer
Transducer, achieves competitive performance on LibriSpeech dataset (3.6\% WER
on test-clean) without external language models. The performance is comparable
to previously published streamable Transformer Transducer and strong hybrid
streaming ASR systems, and is achieved with smaller look-ahead window (140~ms),

emitting and receiving frequency signals controlled by precise clocks between

We set the TS with polar orbits, altitude of around 500 km above ground, and
three evenly distributed GSs with equatorial orbits, altitudes of around 35000
km from the Earth's center. In this case, at any time the TS can be observed
via frequency signal links by at least one GS. In this way we may determine a
potential distribution over the TS-defined sphere (TDS), which is a sphere that
best fits the TS' orbits. Then, based on the potential distribution over the

CT denoising thanks to its superior performance despite the fast computational
time. In particular, cycleGAN has been demonstrated as a powerful unsupervised
learning scheme to improve the low-dose CT image quality without requiring
matched high-dose reference data. Unfortunately, one of the main limitations of
the cycleGAN approach is that it requires two deep neural network generators at
the training phase, although only one of them is used at the inference phase.
The secondary auxiliary generator is needed to enforce the cycle-consistency,
but the additional memory requirement and increases of the learnable parameters
are the main huddles for cycleGAN training. To address this issue, here we
propose a novel cycleGAN architecture using a single switchable generator. In
particular, a single generator is implemented using adaptive instance
normalization (AdaIN) layers so that the baseline generator converting a
low-dose CT image to a routine-dose CT image can be switched to a generator
converting high-dose to low-dose by simply changing the AdaIN code. Thanks to
the shared baseline network, the additional memory requirement and weight
increases are minimized, and the training can be done more stably even with
small training data. Experimental results show that the proposed method
outperforms the previous cycleGAN approaches while using only about half the
parameters.

to compare both data sets. We aim to compare observations from RESIK and RHESSI

with synthetic spectra calculated based on the results of one-dimensional
hydrodynamical (1D-HD) modelling. The analysis was performed for the flare on
20 September 2002. We estimated the geometry of the flaring loop, necessary for
1D-HD modelling, based on images from RHESSI and SOHO/EIT. The distribution of
non-thermal electrons (NTEs) was determined from RHESSI spectra. The 1D-HD
model assumes that non-thermal electrons with a power-law spectrum were
injected at the apex of the flaring loop. The NTEs then heat and evaporate the
chromosphere, filling the loop with hot and dense plasma radiating in soft
X-rays. The total energy of electrons was constrained by comparing observed and
calculated fluxes from GOES 1 - 8 A data. We determined the temperature and
density at every point of the flaring loop throughout the evolution of the
flare, calculating the resulting X-ray spectra. The synthetic spectra
calculated based on the results of hydrodynamic modelling for the 20 September
2002 flare are consistent within a factor of two with the observed RESIK
spectra during most of the duration of the flare. This discrepancy factor is
probably related to the uncertainty on the cross-calibration between RESIK and

objective and constraint functions involve expectations with respect to the
data indices or environmental variables, in addition to deterministic convex
constraints on the domain of the variables. Although the setting is generic and
arises in different machine learning applications, online and efficient
approaches for solving such problems have not been widely studied. Since the
underlying data distribution is unknown a priori, a closed-form solution is
generally not available, and classical deterministic optimization paradigms are
not applicable. State-of-the-art approaches, such as those using the saddle
point framework, can ensure that the optimality gap as well as the constraint
violation decay as $\O\left(T^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)$ where $T$ is the number of
stochastic gradients. The domain constraints are assumed simple and handled via
projection at every iteration. In this work, we propose a novel conservative
stochastic optimization algorithm (CSOA) that achieves zero constraint
violation and $\O\left(T^{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)$ optimality gap.
  Further, the projection operation (for scenarios when calculating projection
is expensive) in the proposed algorithm can be avoided by considering the
conditional gradient or Frank-Wolfe (FW) variant of the algorithm. The
state-of-the-art stochastic FW variants achieve an optimality gap of
$\O\left(T^{-\frac{1}{3}}\right)$ after $T$ iterations, though these algorithms
have not been applied to problems with functional expectation constraints. In
this work, we propose the FW-CSOA algorithm that is not only projection-free
but also achieves zero constraint violation with
$\O\left(T^{-\frac{1}{4}}\right)$ decay of the optimality gap. The efficacy of
the proposed algorithms is tested on two relevant problems: fair classification
and structured matrix completion.

single-layer and bulk-phase BP show slight anisotropic screening. Electron and
hole doping can increase the charge screening of BP and significantly change
the relative static dielectric tensor elements along two different in-plane

We find these technologically-appealing features to be combined with an exotic
microscopic origin of magnetism in doped CdOHCl, a van der Waals material from
which 2D layers may be exfoliated. By means of first principles simulations, we
predict homogeneous hole-doping to give rise to $p$-band magnetism in both the
bulk and monolayer phases and interpret our findings in terms of Stoner
instability: as the Fermi level is tuned via hole-doping through singularities
in the 2D-like density of states, ferromagnetism develops with large saturation
magnetization of 1 $\mu_B$ per hole, leading to a half-metallic behaviour for
layer carrier densities of the order of 10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, we
put forward electrostatic doping as an additional handle to induce magnetism in
monolayers and bilayers of CdOHCl. Upon application of critical electric fields
perpendicular to atomically-thin-films (as low as 0.2 V/$A{\deg}$ and 0.5
V/$A{\deg}$ in the bilayer and monolayer case, respectively), we envisage the
emergence of a magnetic half-metallic state. The different behaviour of
monolayer vs bilayer systems, as well as an observed asymmetric response to
positive and negative electric fields in bilayers, are interpreted in terms of
intrinsic polarity of CdOHCl atomic stacks, a distinctive feature of the
material. In perspective, given the experimentally accessible magnitude of
critical fields in bilayer of CdOHCl, one can envisage $p$ band magnetism to be

parallel gripper. The key is a crawler on the fingertip, which is underactuated
together with other finger joints and switched with a passive and spring-loaded
mechanism. While the idea of crawling finger is not a new one, this paper
contributes to realize the crawling without additional motor. The gripper can
passively change the mode from the parallel approach mode to the pull-in mode,
then finally to the power grasp mode, according to the grasping state. To
optimize the highly underactuated system, we take a combination of black-box
optimization and physics simulation of the whole grasp process. We show that
this simulation-based approach can effectively consider the precontact motion,
in-hand manipulation, power grasp stability, and even failure mode, which is
difficult for the static-equilibrium-analysis-based approaches. In the last
part of the paper, we demonstrate that a prototype gripper with the proposed
structure and design parameters optimized under the proposed process
successfully power-grasped a thin sheet, a softcover book, and a cylinder lying
on a flat surface.

the reaction center (RC) in photosynthetic organisms. As the emitted

of the excitation, the measured fluorescence yield is informed by the migration
of the excitation in the antenna. In this work, the fluorescence yield
concomitant with the oxidized dimer (P+) of the RC were measured during light
excitation (induction) and relaxation (in the dark) for whole cells of
photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides lacking cytochrome c_2 as
natural electron donor to P+ (mutant cycA). The relationship between the
fluorescence yield and P+ (fraction of closed RC) showed deviations from the
standard Joliot-Lavergne-Trissl model: 1) the hyperbola is not symmetric and 2)
exhibits hysteresis. These phenomena originate from the difference between the
delays of fluorescence relative to P+ kinetics during induction and relaxation,
and in structural terms from the non-random distribution of the closed RCs
during induction. The experimental findings are supported by Monte Carlo
simulations and by results from statistical physics based on random walk
approximations of the excitation in the antenna. The applied mathematical
treatment demonstrates the generalization of the standard theory and sets the
stage for a more adequate description of the long-debated kinetics of
fluorescence and of the delicate control and balance between efficient light

a pathological region segmentation network (PRSN). Specifically, the ASSN aims
to segment the anatomical structure where the pathology may exist, and it can
provide a spatial prior for the pathological region segmentation. In addition,
we integrate a denoising auto-encoder (DAE) into the ASSN to generate
segmentation results with plausible shapes. The PRSN is designed to segment

crossing (RISC). Even highly efficient TADF OLEDs are limited by long excited
state lifetimes though, which limit current densities and cause device
degradation. When singlet-triplet energy gaps are comparable to thermal
energies (~tens of millielectronvolts), RISC is fast and limited only by
bottlenecks due to spin-selection rules. We have studied this phenomenon under
device operating conditions using pulsed electrically detected magnetic
resonance spectroscopy (pEDMR) in OLEDs based on the donor:acceptor combination
m MTDATA:BPhen (4,4',4''-tris[phenyl(m-tolyl)amino]triphenylamine : 4,7
diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline). These experiments showed magnetic resonance
signatures of emissive exciplex states at the donor:acceptor interface, yet
these signals did not reveal coherent spin propagation effects. Instead, the
intensity of these signals scales linearly with the energy dose of the applied
microwave pulses. This observation excludes the direct involvement of the
resonantly prepared coherent spin states and indicates that the observed
current response is due to magnetic resonant heating. This implies that the
studied TADF blend is not limited by spin-forbidden RISC, but rather by the

of a task that is presupposed to contain one or more routines. However, a UI
log usually takes the form of a single unsegmented sequence of events. This
paper presents an approach to discover candidate routines from unsegmented UI
logs in the presence of noise, i.e. events within or between routine instances
that do not belong to any routine. The approach is implemented as an
open-source tool and evaluated using synthetic and real-life UI logs.

practically relevant situations such as market equilibria. They also connect
many sub-areas of mathematics like game theory, optimization, and matrix
theory. Despite their close relation to optimization, the protection of LCPs
against uncertainties -- especially in the sense of robust optimization -- is
still in its infancy. During the last years, robust LCPs have only been studied
using the notions of strict and $\Gamma$-robustness. Unfortunately, both
concepts lead to the problem that the existence of robust solutions cannot be
guaranteed. In this paper, we consider affinely adjustable robust LCPs. In the
latter, a part of the LCP solution is allowed to adjust via a function that is
affine in the uncertainty. We show that this notion of robustness allows to
establish strong characterizations of solutions for the cases of uncertain
matrix and vector, separately, from which existence results can be derived.
  Our main results are valid for the case of an uncertain LCP vector. Here, we
additionally provide sufficient conditions on the LCP matrix for the uniqueness
of a solution. Moreover, based on characterizations of the affinely adjustable
robust solutions, we derive a mixed-integer programming formulation that allows
to solve the corresponding robust counterpart. If, in addition, the certain LCP
matrix is positive semidefinite, we prove polynomial-time solvability and
uniqueness of robust solutions. If the LCP matrix is uncertain,
characterizations of solutions are developed for every nominal matrix, i.e.,
these characterizations are, in particular, independent of the definiteness of
the nominal matrix. Robust solutions are also shown to be unique for positive
definite LCP matrix but both uniqueness and mixed-integer programming
formulations still remain open problems if the nominal LCP matrix is not psd.

features. This expense is further multiplied when a query image is evaluated
against a gallery, e.g. in visual relocalization. While we don't obviate the
need for geometric verification, we propose an interpretable image-embedding
that cuts the search in scale space to essentially a lookup.
  Our approach measures the asymmetric relation between two images. The model
then learns a scene-specific measure of similarity, from training examples with
known 3D visible-surface overlaps. The result is that we can quickly identify,
for example, which test image is a close-up version of another, and by what
scale factor. Subsequently, local features need only be detected at that scale.
We validate our scene-specific model by showing how this embedding yields
competitive image-matching results, while being simpler, faster, and also
interpretable by humans.

detection, mainly because of the architectural differences between the two and
the dimensionality of the prediction space of modern detectors. To assess shift
equivariance of object detection models end-to-end, in this paper we propose an
evaluation metric, built upon a greedy search of the lower and upper bounds of
the mean average precision on a shifted image set. Our new metric shows that
modern object detection architectures, no matter if one-stage or two-stage,
anchor-based or anchor-free, are sensitive to even one pixel shift to the input
images. Furthermore, we investigate several possible solutions to this problem,
both taken from the literature and newly proposed, quantifying the
effectiveness of each one with the suggested metric. Our results indicate that
none of these methods can provide full shift equivariance. Measuring and
analyzing the extent of shift variance of different models and the
contributions of possible factors, is a first step towards being able to devise
methods that mitigate or even leverage such variabilities.

crystalline ordering in the black-lipped pearl oyster, Pinctada margaritifera,
reveals that biominerals with varying crystal textures are an unrecognized
class of functionally graded materials. Changing crystal textures inevitably
cause a variation in Young modulus due to the orientation-dependent mechanical
properties of crystals. The case of Pinctada margaritifera demonstrates that
bioceramics with such crystallographical gradients are toughened by stress
delocalization and reduced stress intensity factors, outperforming non-graded
counterparts. These findings suggest that a multitude of biominerals, which are
perceived as poorly ordered because of their polycrystallinity and changing
crystal textures, may be considered as graded materials with hitherto
unidentified emergent mechanical properties. The underlying design principle is
remarkably simple and applicable to a wide range of crystalline material
classes and may thus serve as a blueprint for future bioinspired functional

remarkably isotropic, and this is a consequence of the smearing of the

Non-zero x-ray magnetic circular dichroism signals are observed for every
element in every alloy indicating differences in the populations of the

included in the solid solution, the Cr spin moment is unambiguously
antiparallel to the total magnetic moment, while a vanishingly small magnetic

significant discrepancies are observed between the experimental bulk and

artificial noise scheme is proposed where the radio frequency (RF) source acts
as a jammer that transmits interference signal to the legitimate receivers and
eavesdropper. On this basis, the analytical expressions for the outage

insights, the asymptotic analysis and diversity orders for the OP in the high

behaviors of the IP in the high main-to-eavesdropper ratio (MER) region are
explored as well. Numerical results show that: 1) RHIs, CEEs and ipSIC have
negative effects on the OP but positive effects on the IP; 2) Compared with
CEEs, RHIs have a more serious impact on the reliability and security of the
considered system; 3) There exists a trade-off between reliability and
security, and this trade-off can be optimized by reducing the power coefficient
of the artificial noise or increasing the interfering factor of readers; 4)
There are error floors for the OP due to the CEEs and the reflection

corresponding decision problem, that asks whether a given graph is Hamiltonian

problems. In this paper we study graphs of bounded degree that are \emph{far}
from being Hamiltonian, where a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices is \emph{far} from
being Hamiltonian, if modifying a constant fraction of $n$ edges is necessary
to make $G$ Hamiltonian. We give an explicit deterministic construction of a
class of graphs of bounded degree that are locally Hamiltonian, but (globally)
far from being Hamiltonian. Here, \emph{locally Hamiltonian} means that every
subgraph induced by the neighbourhood of a small vertex set appears in some
Hamiltonian graph. More precisely, we obtain graphs which differ in $\Theta(n)$
edges from any Hamiltonian graph, but non-Hamiltonicity cannot be detected in
the neighbourhood of $o(n)$ vertices. Our class of graphs yields a class of
hard instances for one-sided error property testers with linear query
complexity. It is known that any property tester (even with two-sided error)
requires a linear number of queries to test Hamiltonicity (Yoshida, Ito, 2010).
This is proved via a randomised construction of hard instances. In contrast,
our construction is deterministic. So far only very few deterministic
constructions of hard instances for property testing are known. We believe that
our construction may lead to future insights in graph theory and towards a
characterisation of the properties that are testable in the bounded-degree

proposed agglomerative miner enjoys the similar theoretical guarantee to
produce sound process models (without deadlocks and other anomalies) while
exhibiting some advantages like avoiding silent activities and accommodating
duplicate activities. The proposed algorithm works by iteratively applying a
few graph rewriting rules to the directly-follows-graph of activities. For
real-world (sparse) directly-follows-graphs, the algorithm has quadratic
computational complexity with respect to the number of distinct activities. To
our knowledge, this is the first process discovery algorithm that is made for
the purpose of program synthesis. Experiments on the BPI-Challenge 2020 dataset

the azimuthal wave\-number, $n$. The analysis helps regularizing the governing
system of equations at the centreline, and allows for a complete stability
analysis of three-dimensional perturbations for a general integer value of $n$,
which has hitherto remained a challenge for FENE-P models. It is shown here
that the symmetry and analytic behaviours of the velocity and pressure fields
of the Newtonian counterpart are both preserved in this flow, and the reason is
elucidated. For $|n|=1$, the perturbations to the correlations between the
axial component and the radial or azimuthal components of the end-to-end
polymer vector exhibit behaviour similar to that of the velocity perturbations
close to the centreline, and are traced to the uniformity of axial traction
with respect to the azimuthal direction. For all values of $n$, the fluctuation
to the end-to-end length of the polymer chain vanishes at the centreline. The
ansatzes for the perturbations to the components of conformation tensor arrived
here, using heuristics, are later proved in two separate ways: Frobenius
method, and a method that utilizes observations from Fourier analysis. We also
reveal the existence of natural modes of polymers with trivial velocity
perturbations in the limit of vanishing polymer viscosity. The complex

addition, we predict the invariant mass spectrum for dilepton emission and
explore the most important sources of dileptons above 1 GeV, that are expected

high-resolution spectroscopy, but attempts to improve the wavelength coverage
and versatility of these instruments results in a complicated and variable
footprint of the entrance slit projection onto the science detector.
Traditional spectral extraction methods fail to perform a truly optimal
extraction, when the slit image is not aligned with the detector columns but
instead is tilted or even curved.
  We here present the mathematical algorithms and examples of their application
to the optimal extraction and the following reduction steps for echelle

tilt/curvature of the slit image on the detector and achieve optimal extraction
without prior assumptions about the slit illumination. Thus the new method can
handle arbitrary image slicers, slit scanning, and other observational

wherein each token pays attention to every other token. Recent studies have
shown that these heads exhibit syntactic, semantic, or local behaviour. Some
studies have also identified promise in restricting this attention to be local,
i.e., a token attending to other tokens only in a small neighbourhood around
it. However, no conclusive evidence exists that such local attention alone is
sufficient to achieve high accuracy on multiple NLP tasks. In this work, we
systematically analyse the role of locality information in learnt models and
contrast it with the role of syntactic information. More specifically, we first
do a sensitivity analysis and show that, at every layer, the representation of
a token is much more sensitive to tokens in a small neighborhood around it than
to tokens which are syntactically related to it. We then define an attention
bias metric to determine whether a head pays more attention to local tokens or
to syntactically related tokens. We show that a larger fraction of heads have a
locality bias as compared to a syntactic bias. Having established the
importance of local attention heads, we train and evaluate models where varying
fractions of the attention heads are constrained to be local. Such models would
be more efficient as they would have fewer computations in the attention layer.
We evaluate these models on 4 GLUE datasets (QQP, SST-2, MRPC, QNLI) and 2 MT
datasets (En-De, En-Ru) and clearly demonstrate that such constrained models
have comparable performance to the unconstrained models. Through this
systematic evaluation we establish that attention in Transformer-based models
can be constrained to be local without affecting performance.

media with white noises, information swimmers are generally less efficient than
Brownian particles driven by constant forces. For colored noises with long
correlation times, the frequency of measurement can be greatly reduced without
affecting the efficiency of information swimmers.

wind speed, confirming and strengthening the previous finding. We also present
the results from high-angular-resolution near-infrared imaging studies of the

molecular clouds, the temperature of gas is low enough for water vapour to
condense into amorphous ices on the surface of preexisting refractory dust
particles. Recent numerical simulations and laboratory experiments suggest that
condensation of the vapour promotes dust coagulation in such a cold region.
However, in the numerical simulations, cohesion of refractory materials is
often underestimated, while in the laboratory experiments, water vapour
collides with surfaces at more frequent intervals compared to the real
conditions. Therefore, to re-examine the role of water ice in dust coagulation,
we carry out systematic investigation of available data on coagulation of water
ice particles by making full use of appropriate theories in contact mechanics
and tribology. We find that the majority of experimental data are reasonably
well explained by lubrication theories, owing to the presence of a quasi-liquid
layer (QLL). Only exceptions are the results of dynamic collisions between
particles at low temperatures, which are, instead, consistent with the JKR
theory, because QLLs are too thin to dissipate their kinetic energies. By
considering the vacuum conditions in protoplanetary discs and molecular clouds,
the formation of amorphous water ice on the surface of refractory particles
does not necessarily aid their collisional growth as currently expected. While
crystallisation of water ice around but outside the snow line eases coagulation
of ice-coated particles, sublimation of water ice inside the snow line is
deemed to facilitate coagulation of bare refractory particles.

its energy levels. Alkali halides are simple inorganic surface modifiers that
have been extensively used in organic optoelectronics, however, rarely studied

we investigate the effect of single layer adsorption of twenty different alkali

can shift the position of the valence band maximum (VBM) of NiO to a
surprisingly large extend in both directions, from -3:10 eV to +1:59 eV. We
interpret the direction and magnitude of the shift in terms of the surface
dipoles, formed by the adsorbed cations and anions, where the magnitude of the

(mmWave) systems have received substantial research attention, as a benefit of
their lower cost and modest energy consumption compared to their fully-digital
counterparts. We further improve their performance by conceiving a
Tomlinson-Harashima precoding (THP) based nonlinear joint design for the
downlink of multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) mmWave systems. Our
optimization criterion is that of minimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the
system under channel uncertainties subject both to realistic transmit power
constraint and to the unit modulus constraint imposed on the elements of the
analog beamforming (BF) matrices governing the BF operation in the radio
frequency domain. We transform this optimization problem into a more tractable
form and develop an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) based algorithm
for solving it. Then, a novel two-timescale nonlinear joint hybrid transceiver
design algorithm is developed, which can be viewed as an extension of the
BCD-based joint design algorithm for reducing both the channel state
information (CSI) signalling overhead and the effects of outdated CSI.
Moreover, we determine the near-optimal cancellation order for the THP
structure based on the lower bound of the MSE. The proposed algorithms can be
guaranteed to converge to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution of the original
problem. The simulation results demonstrate that our proposed nonlinear joint
hybrid transceiver design algorithms significantly outperform the existing
linear hybrid transceiver algorithms and approach the performance of the
fully-digital transceiver, despite its lower cost and power dissipation.

learning from a new perspective -- by video pace prediction. It stems from the
observation that human visual system is sensitive to video pace, e.g., slow

played in natural pace, we randomly sample training clips in different paces
and ask a neural network to identify the pace for each video clip. The
assumption here is that the network can only succeed in such a pace reasoning
task when it understands the underlying video content and learns representative

learning to push the model towards discriminating different paces by maximizing
the agreement on similar video content. To validate the effectiveness of the

conditions for the obscuring materials that are responsible for the heavy X-ray
obscuration. The average star formation rate of highly obscured AGNs is similar
to that of stellar mass- ($M_*$-) and $z$-controlled normal galaxies, while the
lack of quiescent hosts is observed for the former. Partial correlation
analyses imply that highly obscured AGN activity (traced by $L_{\rm X}$)
appears to be more fundamentally related to $M_*$, and no dependence of $N_{\rm

GDPR and the app implementations by identifying the data practices declared in

based on \mytool, we detect three kinds of GDPR compliance violations,
including the incompleteness of privacy policy, the inconsistency of data

inconsistent collection behavior. Even worse, among the 59 apps, only 8 apps
try to ensure the transmission security of collected data. However, all of them
contain at least one encryption or SSL misuse. Our work exposes severe privacy
issues to raise awareness of privacy protection for app users and developers.

paper, we formulate a framework for connecting two local VHSs using
ultra-precise frequency signal transmission links between satellites and ground

difference between two ground datum stations without location restrictions, and
consequently determine the height difference of the two VHSs. Simulation
results show that the China's VHS and the US's VHS can be unified at the
accuracy of several centimeters, provided that the stability of atomic clocks

category of a compact Lie group always has an algebraic model. Based on this
idea, we show that the category of rational local systems on a connected finite
loop space always has a simple algebraic model. When the loop space arises from
a connected compact Lie group, this recovers a special case of a result of Pol
and Williamson about rational cofree $G$-spectra. More generally, we show that
if $K$ is a closed subgroup of a compact Lie group $G$ such that the Weyl group
$W_GK$ is connected, then a certain category of rational $G$-spectra `at $K$'
has an algebraic model. For example, when $K$ is the trivial group, this is
just the category of rational cofree $G$-spectra, and this recovers the
aforementioned result. Throughout, we pay careful attention to the role of
torsion and complete categories.

have gained significant importance in the feed industry, primarily used as feed
for aquaculture and other livestock farming. Mathematical model such as Von
Bertalanffy growth model and dynamic energy budget models are available for
modelling the growth of various organisms but have their demerits for their
application to the growth and development of BSF. Also, such dynamic models
were not yet applied to the growth of the BSF larvae despite models proven to
be useful for automation of industrial production process (e.g. feeding,
heating/cooling, ventilation, harvesting, etc.). This work primarily focuses on
developing a model based on the principles of the afore mentioned models from
literature that can provide accurate mathematical description of the dry mass
changes throughout the life cycle and the transition of development phases of
the larvae. To further improve the accuracy of these models, various factors
affecting the growth and development such as temperature, feed quality, feeding
rate, moisture content in feed, and airflow rate are developed and integrated
into the dynamic growth model. An extensive set of data were aggregated from
various literature and used for the model development, parameter estimation and
validation. Models describing the environmental factors were individually
validated based on the data sets collected. In addition, the dynamic growth
model was also validated for dry mass evolution and development stage
transition of larvae reared on different substrate feeding rates. The developed
models with the estimated parameters performed well highlighting its
application in decision-support systems and automation for large scale
production.

analysis approaches are proposed to mitigate the severe phenomenon. However,
such classifiers are opaque, non-intuitive, and difficult for analysts to
understand the inner decision reason. For this reason, a variety of explanation
approaches are proposed to interpret predictions by providing important
features. Unfortunately, the explanation results obtained in the malware
analysis domain cannot achieve a consensus in general, which makes the analysts
confused about whether they can trust such results. In this work, we propose
principled guidelines to assess the quality of five explanation approaches by
designing three critical quantitative metrics to measure their stability,
robustness, and effectiveness. Furthermore, we collect five widely-used malware
datasets and apply the explanation approaches on them in two tasks, including
malware detection and familial identification. Based on the generated
explanation results, we conduct a sanity check of such explanation approaches
in terms of the three metrics. The results demonstrate that our metrics can
assess the explanation approaches and help us obtain the knowledge of most
typical malicious behaviors for malware analysis.

While it was hypothesized that the suppression in the ultracold regime had its
roots in the Fermi statistics of the molecules, this argument is inconsistent
with the fact that the Fermi pressure should set a lower bound for the chemical
reaction rate. Therefore it can not be explained from standard two-body
$p$-wave inelastic collisions. Here we develop a simple model of chemical
reactions that occur via the formation and decay of molecular complexes. We
indeed find that pure two-body molecule losses are unable to explain the
observed suppression. Instead we extend our description beyond two-body physics
by including effective complex-molecule interactions possible emerging from
many-body and effective medium effects at finite densities and in the presence
of trapping light. %Under this framework we observe that additional
complex-molecule collisions, which manifest as a net three-body molecular
interaction could give rise to the additional suppression. Although our
effective model is able to quantitatively reproduce recent experimental
observations, a detailed understanding of the actual physical mechanism
responsible for these higher-order interaction processes is still pending.

presented. The nested sampling algorithm maintains a given set of live points
through regions with increasing probability feasibility until reaching a
desired reliability level. It furthermore leverages efficient strategies from
Bayesian statistics for generating replacement proposals during the search.
Features and advantages of this algorithm are demonstrated by means of a simple
numerical example and two industrial case studies. It is shown that nested
sampling can outperform conventional Monte Carlo sampling and be competitive
with flexibility-based optimization techniques in low-dimensional design space
problems. Practical aspects of exploiting the sampled design space to
reconstruct a feasibility probability map using machine learning techniques are
also discussed and illustrated. Finally, the effectiveness of nested sampling
is demonstrated on a higher-dimensional problem, in the presence of a complex

framework of the functional renormalization group based on the effective action
formalism. We introduce the effective action for the particle-number and
nonlocal pairing densities and demonstrate that the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem for
superfluid systems is established in terms of the effective action. The flow
equation for the effective action is then derived, where the flow parameter
runs from $0$ to $1$, corresponding to the non-interacting and interacting
systems. From the flow equation and the variational equation that the
equilibrium density satisfies, we obtain the exact expression for the Kohn-Sham
potential generalized to including the pairing potentials. The resultant
Kohn-Sham potential has a nice feature that it expresses the microscopic
formulae of the external, Hartree, pairing, and exchange-correlation terms,
separately. It is shown that our Kohn-Sham potential gives the ground-state
energy of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory by neglecting the correlations. An
advantage of our exact formalism lies in the fact that it provides ways to
systematically improve the correlation part.

interaction of the reflected ions and the upstream plasma excites electrostatic

shock surfing acceleration, the shock potential, magnetic reconnection,
stochastic Fermi scattering and the shock compression. The main contributor is
the shock potential. Magnetic field lines are tangled due to the Weibel

$U$ have been generated by distributing a given discrete quantity, a quantum.
Quantum distributions naturally represent a wide range of probability
distributions that are used in practical applications. Moreover, such a class
of distributions can be obtained as an approximation of any probability
distribution. The retrieving of an upper-bound for the entropic divergence is
here shown to be possible under the condition that the compared distributions
are quantum distributions over the same quantum value, thus they become
comparable. Thus, entropic divergence acquires a more powerful meaning when it
is applied to comparable distributions. This aspect should be taken into
account in future developments of divergences. The theoretical findings are
used for proposing a notion of normalized KL divergence that is empirically
shown to behave differently from already known measures.

lie at the intersection of Kaluza-Klein theory and the remarkable dualities of

the local symmetries of an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory into diffeomorphisms
in one dimension higher, ExFTs aim for a much more ambitious goal: to unify the
local symmetries of supergravity fields into a single symmetry manifest on a
higher-dimensional space. Depending on whether we start with Type II or
11-dimensional supergravity, we obtain double and exceptional field theory
respectively which we collectively refer to as ExFTs. At the cost of being
forced into a generalised notion of diffeomorphisms that fail to close onto an
algebra, ExFTs embody a powerful paradigm built on the idea of unification-of
symmetries, of fields and of solutions.
  However, ExFTs are much more than just a rewriting of supergravities. They
have been found to contain much more than was originally put into their
construction and, in this thesis, we discuss some of the more exotic aspects of
these theories. We describe a novel solution in exceptional field theory that
unifies a whole family of so-called 'exotic branes' into a single solution on
the extended space. We follow this with the construction of a maximally
non-Riemannian solution whose reduction to the usual spacetime is free of the
scalar moduli that typically plague dimensional reductions. In the final part,
we consider reductions between exceptional field theories and illustrate,
amongst other things, that we can have ExFTs defined on local patches that
nevertheless cannot be related by even the duality transformations of the

extensive high-mass star formation and hosts remarkable ""pillars"". We herein
obtained new $^{12}$CO $J=$1-0 data for the region observed with NANTEN2, which
were combined with the $^{12}$CO $J=$1-0 data obtained using FUGIN survey.
These observations revealed that a giant molecular cloud (GMC) of $\sim 1.3
\times 10^5$ \Msun \ is associated with M16, which is elongated by over 30 pc
and is perpendicular to the galactic plane, at a distance of 1.8 kpc. This GMC
can be divided into the northern (N) cloud, the eastern (E) filament, the
southeast (SE) cloud, the southeast (SE) filament, and the southern (S) cloud.
We also found two velocity components (blue and red shifted component) in the N
cloud. The blue-shifted component shows a ring-like structure, as well as the
red-shifted component coincides with the intensity depression of the ring-like
structure. The position-velocity diagram of the components showed a V-shaped
velocity feature. The spatial and velocity structures of the cloud indicated
that two different velocity components collided with each other at a relative
velocity of 11.6 \kms. The timescale of the collision was estimated to be $\sim
4 \times 10^5$ yr. The collision event reasonably explains the formation of the
O9V star ALS15348, as well as the shape of the Spitzer bubble N19. A similar
velocity structure was found in the SE cloud, which is associated with the
O7.5V star HD168504. In addition, the complementary distributions of the two
velocity components found in the entire GMC suggested that the collision event
occurred globally. On the basis of the above results, we herein propose a
hypothesis that the collision between the two components occurred sequentially
over the last several $10^{6}$ yr and triggered the formation of O-type stars
in the NGC6611 cluster.

the 'DARPA Red Balloon Challenge'. Ten red weather balloons were fixed at
unknown locations in the US. An open challenge was launched to locate all ten,
the first to do so would be declared the winner receiving a cash prize. A team
from MIT Media Lab was able to locate them all within 9 hours using social
media and a novel reward scheme that rewarded viral recruitment. This
achievement was rightly seen as proof of the remarkable ability of social
media, then relatively nascent, to solve real world problems such as
large-scale spatial search. Upon reflection, however, the challenge was also
remarkable as it succeeded despite many efforts to provide false information on
the location of the balloons. At the time the false reports were filtered based
on manual inspection of visual proof and comparing the IP addresses of those
reporting with the purported coordinates of the balloons. In the ten years
since, misinformation on social media has grown in prevalence and
sophistication to be one of the defining social issues of our time. Seen
differently we can cast the misinformation observed in the Red Balloon
Challenge, and unexpected adverse effects in other social mobilisation
challenges subsequently, not as bugs but as essential features. We further
investigate the role of the increasing levels of political polarisation in
modulating social mobilisation. We confirm that polarisation not only impedes
the overall success of mobilisation, but also leads to a low reachability to
oppositely polarised states, significantly hampering recruitment. We find that
diversifying geographic pathways of social influence are key to circumvent
barriers of political mobilisation and can boost the success of new open
challenges.

gas density structure (i.e. gas gaps) remain rare and uncertain. We want to
investigate the importance of thermo-chemical processes for the interpretation
of high-spatial-resolution gas observations of planet-forming disks and their
impact on derived gas properties. We apply the radiation thermo-chemical disk
code ProDiMo (PROtoplanetary DIsk MOdel) to model self-consistently the dust
and gas disk of HD 163296, using the DSHARP gas and dust observations. With
this model we investigate the impact of dust gaps and gas gaps, considering
chemistry and heating/cooling processes, on the observables and the derived gas
properties. We find distinct peaks in the radial line intensity profiles of the
CO line data of HD 163296 at the location of the dust gaps. Our model indicates
that those peaks are not only a consequence of a gas temperature increase
within the gaps but are mainly caused by the absorption of line emission from
the back side of the disk by the dust rings. For two of the three prominent
dust gaps in HD 163296, we find that thermo-chemical effects are negligible for
deriving density gradients via measurements of the rotation velocity. However,
for the gap with the highest dust depletion, the temperature gradient can be
dominant and needs to be considered to derive accurate gas density profiles.
Self-consistent gas and dust thermo-chemical modelling in combination with
high-quality observations of multiple molecules are necessary to accurately
derive gas gap depths and shapes. This is crucial to determine the origin of
gaps and rings in planet-forming disks and to improve the mass estimates of
forming planets if they are the cause of the gap.

for studying the GRB physics and constraining the GRB redshift. Since the
line-like feature in the GRB X-ray spectrum was first reported in 1999, several
works on line searching have been published over the past two decades. Even
though some observations on the X-ray line-like feature were performed, the
significance remains controversial to date. In this paper, we utilize the
down-Comptonization mechanism and present the time evolution of the Fe
K$\alpha$ line emitted near the GRB central engine. The line intensity
decreases with the evolution time, and the time evolution depends on the the
electron density and the electron temperature. In addition, the initial line
with a larger broadening decreases less over time. For instance, when the
emission line penetrates material with the an electron density above $10^{12}$
cm$^{-3}$ at 1 keV, it generally becomes insignificant enough after 100 s for
it not to be detected. The line-like profile deviates from the Gaussian form,
and it finally changes to be similar to a blackbody shape at the time of the
thermal equilibrium between the line photons and the surrounding material.

function of separation distance for low slip and shear Reynolds numbers

particle-wall separation distances and $Re_{\gamma}, Re_{\text{slip}} \leq

Numerical simulation of the `drying-mediated-self-assembly' process shows that
the nanoparticle-solvent interaction plays an important role in forming the

simulation of the magnetic hysteresis loops, on the other hand, points out the
importance of spin pinning at the surface of nanoparticles as a result of
surface functionalization of the particles in different suspension media.
Depending on the concentration of pinned spins at the surface pointing
preferably along the easy-axis direction - from greater than 50\% to less than

long chromosomal domains that are topologically independent from each other,
meaning that change of DNA superhelicity in one domain does not propagate to
neighbors. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have been performed to
question the nature of the topological barriers at play, leading to several
predictions on possible molecular actors. Here, we address the question of
topological barriers using polymer models of supercoiled DNA chains. More
specifically, we determine under which conditions DNA-bridging proteins may act
as topological barriers. To this end, we developed a coarse-grained
bead-and-spring model and investigated its properties through Brownian dynamics
simulations. As a result, we find that DNA-bridging proteins must exert rather
strong constraints on their binding sites: they must block the diffusion of the
excess of twist through the two binding sites on the DNA molecule and,
simultaneously, prevent the rotation of one DNA segment relative to the other
one. Importantly, not all DNA-bridging proteins satisfy this second condition.
For example, single bridges formed by proteins that bind DNA non-specifically,
like H-NS dimers, are expected to fail with this respect. Our findings might
also explain, in the case of specific DNA-bridging proteins like LacI, why
multiple bridges are required to create stable independent topological domains.
Strikingly, when the relative rotation of the DNA segments is not prevented,
relaxation results in complex intrication of the two domains. Moreover, while
the value of the torsional stress in each domain may vary, their differential
is preserved. Our work also predicts that nucleoid associated proteins known to
wrap DNA must form higher protein-DNA complexes to efficiently work as
topological barriers.

patients from the MIMIC-CXR chest radiograph dataset were included. This

Deep learning models were developed using two approaches: a semi-supervised
model using a variational autoencoder and a pre-trained supervised learning
model using a dense neural network. Receiver operating characteristic curve

  Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for
differentiating alveolar edema from no edema was 0.99 for the semi-supervised

inversely related to the difficulty in categorizing milder states of pulmonary

double well potential, the Ising model and MD simulations on Alanine

susceptibility and energy density for the Ising model indicate clear gains in
sampling efficiency over conventional Gibbs sampling techniques with DBC and
also over the conventionally used simulated tempering with Metropolis-Hastings
(MH) scheme. Simulations on ALA5 with large number of temperatures indicate
distinct gains in mixing times for inverse temperature and consequently the
energy of the system compared to conventional MH. With no additional
computational overhead, our methods were found to be more efficient
alternatives to conventionally used simulated tempering methods with DBC. Our
algorithms should be particularly advantageous in simulations of large systems
with many temperature ladders, as our algorithms showed a more favorable
constant scaling in Ising spin systems as compared with both reversible and

to the risk of a healthcare system collapse. Although these strategies can be
suggested, their actual implementation may depend on the population perception
of the disease risk. The current COVID-19 crisis, for instance, is showing that
some individuals are much more prone than others to remain isolated, avoiding
unnecessary contacts. With this motivation, we propose an epidemiological SIR
model that uses evolutionary game theory to take into account dynamic
individual quarantine strategies, intending to combine in a single process
social strategies, individual risk perception, and viral spreading. The disease
spreads in a population whose agents can choose between self-isolation and a
lifestyle careless of any epidemic risk. The strategy adoption is individual
and depends on the perceived disease risk compared to the quarantine cost. The
game payoff governs the strategy adoption, while the epidemic process governs
the agent's health state. At the same time, the infection rate depends on the
agent's strategy while the perceived disease risk depends on the fraction of
infected agents. Results show recurrent infection waves, which were seen in
previous epidemic scenarios with quarantine. Notably, the risk perception is
found to be fundamental for controlling the magnitude of the infection peak,
while the final infection size is mainly dictated by the infection rates. Low
awareness leads to a single and strong infection peak, while a greater disease
risk leads to shorter, although more frequent, peaks. The proposed model
spontaneously captures relevant aspects of a pandemic event, highlighting the

one observed covariate, an unobserved component and an additive treatment
effect where the only randomness comes from the treatment allocations. It is
well-known that the power depends on the allocations' imbalance in the observed
covariate and this is the reason for the classic restricted designs such as
rerandomization. We show that power is also affected by two other design
choices: the number of allocations in the design and the degree of linear
dependence among the allocations. We prove that the more allocations, the
higher the power and the lower the variability in the power. Designs that
feature greater independence of allocations are also shown to have higher
performance.
  Our theoretical findings and extensive simulation studies imply that the
designs with the highest power provide thousands of highly independent
allocations that each provide nominal imbalance in the observed covariates.
These high powered designs exhibit less randomization than complete
randomization and more randomization than recently proposed designs based on
numerical optimization. Model choices for a practicing experimenter are
rerandomization and greedy pair switching, where both outperform complete
randomization and numerical optimization. The tradeoff we find also provides a

model-based control methods to exploit learning techniques for improving the

the practical applicability of learning methods in control are their high
computational complexity and limited generalization capabilities to unseen
conditions. Meta-learning is a powerful tool that enables efficient learning
across a finite set of related tasks, easing adaptation to new unseen tasks.
This paper makes use of a meta-learning approach for adaptive model predictive
control, by learning a system model that leverages data from previous related
tasks, while enabling fast fine-tuning to the current task during closed-loop
operation. The dynamics is modeled via Gaussian process regression and,
building on the Karhunen-Lo{\`e}ve expansion, can be approximately reformulated
as a finite linear combination of kernel eigenfunctions. Using data collected
over a set of tasks, the eigenfunction hyperparameters are optimized in a
meta-training phase by maximizing a variational bound for the log-marginal
likelihood. During meta-testing, the eigenfunctions are fixed, so that only the
linear parameters are adapted to the new unseen task in an online adaptive
fashion via Bayesian linear regression, providing a simple and efficient
inference scheme. Simulation results are provided for autonomous racing with
miniature race cars adapting to unseen road conditions.

  Materials and Methods: We retrospectively selected a cohort of 86 COVID-19

the northeastern USA, who underwent chest CT and CXR within 48 hrs. The ground

manual AD segmentation on CT. The resulting 3D masks were projected into 2D
anterior-posterior digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRR) to compute
area-based AD percentage (POa). A convolutional neural network (CNN) was
trained with DRR images generated from a larger-scale CT dataset of COVID-19

POa on CXR. CNN POa results were compared to POa quantified on CXR by two
expert readers and to the POv ground-truth, by computing correlations and mean

  Results: Bootstrap mean absolute error (MAE) and correlations between POa and
POv were 11.98% [11.05%-12.47%] and 0.77 [0.70-0.82] for average of expert

quantification of the reliability of automated image analysis is essential, in

treatment decisions. In this work, we provide an entire framework to diagnose
ischemic stroke patients incorporating Bayesian uncertainty into the analysis
procedure. We present a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) yielding a
probability for a stroke lesion on 2D Magnetic Resonance (MR) images with
corresponding uncertainty information about the reliability of the prediction.
For patient-level diagnoses, different aggregation methods are proposed and
evaluated, which combine the single image-level predictions. Those methods take
advantage of the uncertainty in image predictions and report model uncertainty
at the patient-level. In a cohort of 511 patients, our Bayesian CNN achieved an
accuracy of 95.33% at the image-level representing a significant improvement of
2% over a non-Bayesian counterpart. The best patient aggregation method yielded
95.89% of accuracy. Integrating uncertainty information about image predictions
in aggregation models resulted in higher uncertainty measures to false patient
classifications, which enabled to filter critical patient diagnoses that are
supposed to be closer examined by a medical doctor. We therefore recommend
using Bayesian approaches not only for improved image-level prediction and
uncertainty estimation but also for the detection of uncertain aggregations at

obtained by modulating a wideband carrier by a narrowband signal containing a

demodulation/despreading restores the information-carrying narrowband signal.
In this paper, we introduce an alternative approach, where the low-rate
information is encoded directly into a wideband waveform of a given bandwidth,
without physical ""spreading"" of the carrier's frequency. The main advantages of
this approach lie in extended options for encoding the information, and in
retaining a reversible control over the temporal and amplitude structures of
the modulating wideband waveforms. Significant ""excess bandwidth"" (over that
needed to carry the information) enables us to use allpass filters to manage
statistical properties and time-domain appearances of these waveforms without
changing their spectral composition. For example, a mixture of transmitted
waveforms can be shaped as a low-crest-factor signal (e.g. to reduce the burden
on the power amplifier), and/or made statistically indistinguishable from
Gaussian noise (e.g. for covert transmissions and physical layer
steganography), while the selected components of the received waveform can be
transformed into high-crest-factor pulse trains suitable for multiplexing
and/or low-SNR communications. Further, control over the temporal and amplitude
structures of wideband waveforms carrying low-rate information enables
effective use of nonlinear filtering techniques. Such techniques can be
employed for robust real-time asynchronous extraction of the information, as
well as for separation of wideband signal components with identical spectral
content from each other. This can facilitate development of a large variety of
low-SNR and covert communication configurations.

captured across various source and target domains. Moreover, given the
laborious task of collecting and annotating videos, and subjective bias due to
ambiguity among adjacent intensity levels, weakly-supervised learning is
gaining attention in such applications. State-of-the-art WSL models are
typically formulated as regression problems, and do not leverage the ordinal
relationship among pain intensity levels, nor temporal coherence of multiple
consecutive frames. This paper introduces a new DL model for weakly-supervised
DA with ordinal regression that can be adapted using target domain videos with
coarse labels provided on a periodic basis. The WSDA-OR model enforces ordinal
relationships among intensity levels assigned to target sequences, and
associates multiple relevant frames to sequence-level labels. In particular, it
learns discriminant and domain-invariant feature representations by integrating
multiple instance learning with deep adversarial DA, where soft Gaussian labels
are used to efficiently represent the weak ordinal sequence-level labels from
target domain. The proposed approach was validated using RECOLA video dataset
as fully-labeled source domain data, and UNBC-McMaster shoulder pain video
dataset as weakly-labeled target domain data. We have also validated WSDA-OR on
BIOVID and Fatigue datasets for sequence level estimation.

problem concerns the task of assigning the cars, initially located at given
stations, to maximize the number of satisfied customers. We consider the
problem with two stations where each customer has exactly two demands in
opposite directions between both stations, and a customer is satisfied only if
both their demands are fulfilled. For solving this problem, we propose
mixed-integer programming (MIP) models and matheuristics based on local search.
We created a benchmark of instances used to test the exact and heuristic
approaches. Additionally, we proposed a preprocessing procedure to reduce the

proposed instances with 1000 customers in 10 minutes, with an average gap
smaller than 0.1% for all these instances. For larger instances (2500 and 5000

phonetic information in a speech enhancement (SE) system to achieve better
denoising performance. To obtain the phonetic information, we usually prepare a
phoneme-based acoustic model, which is trained using speech waveforms and
phoneme labels. Despite performing well in normal noisy conditions, when
operating in very noisy conditions, however, the recognized phonemes may be
erroneous and thus misguide the SE process. To overcome the limitation, this
study proposes to incorporate the broad phonetic class (BPC) information into
the SE process. We have investigated three criteria to build the BPC, including
two knowledge-based criteria: place and manner of articulatory and one
data-driven criterion. Moreover, the recognition accuracies of BPCs are much
higher than that of phonemes, thus providing more accurate phonetic information
to guide the SE process under very noisy conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed SE with the BPC information framework can achieve
notable performance improvements over the baseline system and an SE system
using monophonic information in terms of both speech quality intelligibility on

it is argued that inside small isolated quantum systems, time does not pass as
we are used to, and it is primarily in this sense that quantum objects enjoy
only limited reality. Quantum systems, which we know, are embedded in the
everyday classical world. Their preparation as well as their measurement-phases
leave durable records and traces in the entropy of the environment. The
Landauer Principle then gives a quantitative threshold for irreversibility.
With double slit experiments and tunneling as paradigmatic examples, it is
proposed that a label of timelessness offers clues for rendering a Copenhagen
type interpretation of quantum physics more realistic and acceptable by
providing a coarse but viable link from the fundamental quantum realm to the
classical world which humans directly experience.

  Form Improvement",,,,,"cs.HC cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Sports franchises invest a lot in training their athletes. use of latest
technology for this purpose is also very common. We propose a system of
capturing motion of athletes during weight training and analyzing that data to
find out any shortcomings and imperfections. Our system uses Kinect depth image
to compute different parameters of athlete's selected joints. These parameters
are passed through certain algorithms to process them and formulate results on
their basis. Some parameters like range of motion, speed and balance can be
analyzed in real time. But for comparison to be performed between motions, data
is first recorded and stored and then processed for accurate results. Our
results depict that this system can be easily deployed and implemented to
provide a very valuable insight to dynamics of a work out and help an athlete
in improving his form.

  Internet of Vehicles","12 pages, 11 figures, Accepted for publication in Transactions on
  Emerging Telecommunications Technologies (ETT)",,,,"physics.soc-ph cs.SI eess.SP","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The respiratory viral diseases, such as those caused by the family of
coronaviruses, can be extremely contagious and spread through saliva droplets
generated by coughing, sneezing, or breathing. In humans, the most common
symptoms of the infection include fever and difficulty in breathing. In order
to reduce the diffusion of the current ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)""
pandemic, the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies can play an important role;
for instance, they can be effectively used for implementing a real-time patient
tracking and warning system at a city scale. Crucial places to install the
tracking IoT devices are the public/private vehicles that, augmented with
multiple connectivity solutions, can implement the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
paradigm. In such a ubiquitous network environment, vehicles are equipped with
a variety of sensors, including regular cameras that can be replaced with
thermal cameras. Therefore, this paper proposes a new design for widely
detecting respiratory viral diseases that leverages IoV to collect real-time
body temperature and breathing rate measurements of pedestrians. This
information can be used to recognize geographic areas affected by possible
COVID-19 cases and to implement proactive preventive strategies that would
further limit the spread of the disease.
