the differences in event occurrences between logs for failing and passing runs,
to highlight events that are stronger associated with failing runs.
  Using data provided by our industrial partner, we empirically investigate the
following questions: (i) How well does SBLD reduce the effort needed to
identify all failure-relevant events in the log for a failing run? (ii) How is
the performance of SBLD affected by available data? (iii) How does SBLD compare
to searching for simple textual patterns that often occur in failure-relevant
events? We answer (i) and (ii) using summary statistics and heatmap
visualizations, and for (iii) we compare three configurations of SBLD (with
resp. minimum, median and maximum data) against a textual search using Wilcoxon
signed-rank tests and the Vargha-Delaney measure of stochastic superiority.
  Our evaluation shows that (i) SBLD achieves a significant effort reduction
for the dataset used, (ii) SBLD benefits from additional logs for passing runs
in general, and it benefits from additional logs for failing runs when there is
a proportional amount of logs for passing runs in the data. Finally, (iii) SBLD
and textual search are roughly equally effective at effort-reduction, while
textual search has a slightly better recall. We investigate the cause, and
discuss how it is due to the characteristics of a specific part of our data.
  We conclude that SBLD shows promise as a method for diagnosing failing runs,
that its performance is positively affected by additional data, but that it
does not outperform textual search on the dataset considered. Future work
includes investigating SBLD's generalizability on additional datasets.

symmetry. Additionally, we present temperature-dependent linear optical
characterizations near the band edge of this family of materials using

unidirectional transitions. The uncertainty relation involves a mixture of
thermodynamic and dynamic terms. Namely, the entropy production from
bidirectional transitions, and the net flux of unidirectional transitions. The
derivation does not assume a steady-state, and the results apply equally well
to transient processes with arbitrary initial conditions. As every
bidirectional transition can also be seen as a pair of separate unidirectional
ones, our approach is equipped with an inherent degree of freedom. Thus, for
any given system, an ensemble of valid TURs can be derived. However, we find
that choosing a representation that best matches the systems dynamics over the
observation time will yield a TUR with a tighter bound on fluctuations. More
precisely, we show a bidirectional representation should be replaced by a
unidirectional one when the entropy production associated with the transitions
between two states is larger than the sum of the net fluxes between them. Thus,
in addition to offering TURs for systems where such relations were previously
unavailable, the results presented herein also provide a systematic method to
improve TUR bounds via physically motivated replacement of bidirectional
transitions with pairs of unidirectional transitions. The power of our approach

continued growth. As Web 2.0 has gained traction and more tools have become

decisions, specifically due to the colossal information available in online
reviews. ISPs can use this information to better understand the views of the
customers about their products and services. The goal of this paper is to
identify the current strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT)
of each ISP by exploring consumer reviews using text analytics. The proposed
approach consists of four different stages: bigram and trigram analyses, topic
identification, SWOT analysis and Root Cause Analysis (RCA). For each ISP, we
first categorize online reviews into positive and negative based on customer
ratings and then leverage text analytic tools to determine the most frequently
used and co-occurring words in each categorization of reviews. Subsequently,
looking at the positive and negative topics in each ISP, we conduct the SWOT
analysis as well as the RCA to help companies identify the internal and
external factors impacting customer satisfaction. We use a case study to
illustrate the proposed approach. The proposed managerial insights that are
derived from the results can act as a decision support tool for ISPs to offer

Berry phase of a spin-1/2 is given by half the solid angle enclosed by the

higher spins may also be related to the geometry of the Majorana constellation.
We find that for a spin-1 state, besides the expected contributions from the
solid angles enclosed by the close paths of the two Majorana stars, the Berry
phase includes a term related to the twist of the relative position vector
around the barycenter vector of the two Majorana stars, i.e., the self-rotation
of the constellation. Interestingly, if the spin-1 state is taken as a
symmetrized two-qubit state, the extra contribution to the Berry phase is given
by the self-rotation of the Majorana constellation weighted by the quantum

  Screening",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Prenatal screening with ultrasound can lower neonatal mortality significantly
for selected cardiac abnormalities. However, the need for human expertise,
coupled with the high volume of screening cases, limits the practically
achievable detection rates. In this paper we discuss the potential for deep
learning techniques to aid in the detection of congenital heart disease (CHD)
in fetal ultrasound. We propose a pipeline for automated data curation and
classification. During both training and inference, we exploit an auxiliary
view classification task to bias features toward relevant cardiac structures.
This bias helps to improve in F1-scores from 0.72 and 0.77 to 0.87 and 0.85 for
healthy and CHD classes respectively.

  Symposium on Microarchitecture",,,"cs.CV cs.AR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Point cloud analytics is poised to become a key workload on battery-powered
embedded and mobile platforms in a wide range of emerging application domains,
such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality, where efficiency
is paramount. This paper proposes Mesorasi, an algorithm-architecture
co-designed system that simultaneously improves the performance and energy
efficiency of point cloud analytics while retaining its accuracy. Our extensive
characterizations of state-of-the-art point cloud algorithms show that, while
structurally reminiscent of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), point cloud
algorithms exhibit inherent compute and memory inefficiencies due to the unique
characteristics of point cloud data. We propose delayed-aggregation, a new
algorithmic primitive for building efficient point cloud algorithms.
Delayed-aggregation hides the performance bottlenecks and reduces the compute
and memory redundancies by exploiting the approximately distributive property
of key operations in point cloud algorithms. Delayed-aggregation let point
cloud algorithms achieve 1.6x speedup and 51.1% energy reduction on a mobile
GPU while retaining the accuracy (-0.9% loss to 1.2% gains). To maximize the
algorithmic benefits, we propose minor extensions to contemporary CNN
accelerators, which can be integrated into a mobile Systems-on-a-Chip (SoC)
without modifying other SoC components. With additional hardware support,
Mesorasi achieves up to 3.6x speedup.

  Pures et Appliqu\'ees",,,,"math.AP math.CA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We develop a method to study the structure of the common part of the
boundaries of disjoint and possibly non-complementary time-varying domains in
$\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, $n \geq 2$, at the points of mutual absolute continuity of
their respective caloric measures. Our set of techniques, which is based on
parabolic tangent measures, allows us to tackle the following problems: 1) Let
$\Omega_1$ and $\Omega_2$ be disjoint domains in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, $n \geq
2$, which are quasi-regular for the heat equation and regular for the adjoint
heat equation, and their complements satisfy a mild non-degeneracy hypothesis
on the set $E$ of mutual absolute continuity of the associated caloric measures
$\omega_i$ with poles at $\bar{p}_i=(p_i,t_i)\in\Omega_i$, $i=1,2$. Then, we
obtain a parabolic analogue of the results of Kenig, Preiss, and Toro, i.e., we
show that the parabolic Hausdorff dimension of $\omega_1|_E$ is $n+1$ and the
tangent measures of $\omega_1$ at $\omega_1$-a.e. point of $E$ are equal to a
constant multiple of the parabolic $(n+1)$-Hausdorff measure restricted to
hyperplanes containing a line parallel to the time-axis. 2) If, additionally,
$\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are doubling, $\log \frac{d\omega_2|_E}{d\omega_1|_E}
\in VMO(\omega_1|_E)$, and $E$ is relatively open in the support of $\omega_1$,
then their tangent measures at {\it every} point of $E$ are caloric measures
associated with adjoint caloric polynomials. As a corollary we obtain that in
complementary $\delta$-Reifenberg flat domains, if $\delta$ is small enough and
$\log \frac{d\omega_2}{d\omega_1} \in VMO(\omega_1)$, then $\Omega_1 \cap
\{t<t_2\}$ is vanishing Reifenberg flat. This generalizes results of Kenig and
Toro for the Laplacian. 3) We establish a parabolic version of a theorem of
Tsirelson about triple-points for harmonic measure.

the classification of hyperuniform point configurations has received
considerable attention, much less is known about the classification of
hyperuniform heterogeneous two-phase media, which include composites, porous
media, foams, cellular solids, colloidal suspensions and polymer blends. The
purpose of this article is to begin such a program for certain two-dimensional
models of hyperuniform two-phase media by ascertaining their local
volume-fraction variances $\sigma^2_{_V}(R)$ and the associated hyperuniformity
order metrics $\overline{B}_V$. This is a highly challenging task because the
geometries and topologies of the phases are generally much richer and more
complex than point-configuration arrangements and one must ascertain a broadly
applicable length scale to make key quantities dimensionless. Therefore, we
focus on a certain class of two-dimensional periodic cellular networks,
periodic and disordered/irregular packings, some of which maximize their
effective transport and elastic properties. Among the cellular networks
considered, the honeycomb networks have a minimal value of $\overline{B}_V$
across all volume fractions. On the other hand, among all packings considered,
the triangular-lattice packings have the smallest values of $\overline{B}_V$
for the possible range of volume fractions. Among all structures studied here,
the triangular-lattice packing has the minimal order metric for almost all
volume fractions. Our study provides a theoretical foundation for the
establishment of hyperuniformity order metrics for general two-phase media and
a basis to discover new hyperuniform two-phase systems by inverse design
procedures.

work has focused on compressing individual point cloud frames, this paper
proposes a novel system that effectively compresses a sequence of point clouds.
The idea to exploit both the spatial and temporal redundancies in a sequence of
point cloud frames. We first identify a key frame in a point cloud sequence and
spatially encode the key frame by iterative plane fitting. We then exploit the
fact that consecutive point clouds have large overlaps in the physical space,
and thus spatially encoded data can be (re-)used to encode the temporal stream.
Temporal encoding by reusing spatial encoding data not only improves the
compression rate, but also avoids redundant computations, which significantly
improves the compression speed. Experiments show that our compression system
achieves 40x to 90x compression rate, significantly higher than the MPEG's
LiDAR point cloud compression standard, while retaining high end-to-end
application accuracies. Meanwhile, our compression system has a compression
speed that matches the point cloud generation rate by today LiDARs and
out-performs existing compression systems, enabling real-time point cloud
transmission.

reinforcement learning, which uses deep learning to approximate the
action-value function. Solving numerous Deep reinforcement learning challenges
such as moving targets problem and the correlation between samples are the main
advantages of this model. Although there have been various extensions of DQN in
recent years, they all use a similar method to DQN to overcome the problem of
moving targets. Despite the advantages mentioned, synchronizing the network
weight in a fixed step size, independent of the agent's behavior, may in some
cases cause the loss of some properly learned networks. These lost networks may
lead to states with more rewards, hence better samples stored in the replay
memory for future training. In this paper, we address this problem from the DQN
family and provide an adaptive approach for the synchronization of the neural
weights used in DQN. In this method, the synchronization of weights is done
based on the recent behavior of the agent, which is measured by a criterion at
the end of the intervals. To test this method, we adjusted the DQN and rainbow
methods with the proposed adaptive synchronization method. We compared these
adjusted methods with their standard form on well-known games, which results
confirm the quality of our synchronization methods.

reversible conversion of a clinical linear accelerator (LINAC) and deliver
electron FLASH (eFLASH) or conventional beams to the treatment room isocenter.
Material & Methods: The LINAC was converted to deliver eFLASH beam within 20
minutes by retracting the x-ray target from the beam's path, positioning the
carousel on an empty port, and selecting 10 MV photon beam energy in the
treatment console. Dose per pulse and average dose rate were measured in a
solid water phantom at different depths with Gafchromic film and OSLD. A pulse
controller counted the pulses via scattered radiation signal and gated the
delivery for preset pulse count. A fast photomultiplier tube-based Cherenkov
detector measured per pulse beam output at 2 ns sampling rate. After conversion
back to clinical mode, conventional beam output, flatness, symmetry, field size
and energy were measured for all clinically commissioned energies. Results:
Dose per pulse of 0.86 +/- 0.01 Gy (310 +/- 7 Gy/s average dose rate) were
achieved at isocenter. The dose from simultaneous irradiation of film and OSLD
were within 1%. The PMT showed the LINAC required about 5 pulses before the
output stabilized and its long-term stability was within 3% for measurements
performed at 3 minutes intervals. The dose, flatness, symmetry, and photon
energy were unchanged from baseline and within tolerance (1%, 3%, 2%, and 0.1%
respectively) after reverting to conventional beams. Conclusion: 10 MeV FLASH
beams were achieved at the isocenter of the treatment room. The beam output was
reproducible but requires further investigation of the ramp up time in the
first 5 pulses, equivalent to <100 cGy. The eFLASH beam can irradiate both
small and large subjects in minimally modified clinical settings and dose rates
can be further increased by reducing the source to surface distance.

context, the highest weight $t\in\mathbb{C}^\times$ of the representation
determines the polynomial variable. For any semisimple Lie algebra
$\mathfrak{g}$ of rank $n$, we extend their construction to a link invariant
$\Delta_{\mathfrak{g}}$, which takes values in $n$-variable Laurent
polynomials. The focus of this paper is the case
$\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_3$. For any knot $K$, evaluating
$\Delta_{\mathfrak{sl}_3}$ at ${t_1=1}$, ${t_2=1}$, or ${t_2= it_1^{-1}}$
recovers the Alexander polynomial of $K$. This is not obvious from an
examination of the $R$-matrix, as the $R$-matrix evaluated at these parameters
does not satisfy the Alexander-Conway skein relation. We tabulate
$\Delta_{\mathfrak{sl}_3}$ for all knots up to seven crossings along with
various other examples. In particular, it distinguishes the Kinoshita-Terasaka
knot and Conway knot mutant pair and is nontrivial on the Whitehead double of
the trefoil.

shock acceleration and scattering during transport can cause energy-spectral
indices to be correlated with enhancement or suppression of element abundances
versus mass-to-charge ratios A/Q. We observe correlations for those ""gradual""
SEP events where shock waves accelerate ions from the ambient coronal plasma,
but there are no such correlations for ""impulsive"" SEP events produced by
magnetic reconnection in solar jets, where abundance enhancement in different
events vary from (A/Q)^+2 to (A/Q)^+8, nor are there correlations when shock
waves reaccelerate these residual impulsive ions. In these latter events the
abundances are determined separately, prior to the accelerated spectra. Events
with correlated spectra and abundances show a wide variety of interesting
behavior that has not been described previously. Small and moderate gradual SEP
events, with relative abundances typically depending approximately upon
(A/Q)^-1 and the spectra upon energy E^-2.5, vary little with time. Large SEP
events show huge temporal variations skirting the correlation line; in one case
O spectra vary with time from E^-1 to E^-5 while abundances vary from (A/Q)^+1
to (A/Q)^-2 during the event. In very large events, streaming-limited transport
through proton-generated resonant Alfve'n waves flattens the spectra and
enhances heavy ion abundances prior to local shock passage, then steepens the
spectra and reduces enhancements afterward, recapturing the typical
correlation. Systematic correlation of spectra and element abundances provide a
new perspective on the ""injection problem"" of ion selection by shocks and on
the physics of SEP acceleration and transport.

electricity demand provides insights not only into how dramatic restrictions
shape electricity demand but also about future electricity use in a
post-COVID-19 world. We develop a unified modeling framework to quantify and
compare electricity usage changes in 58 countries and regions around the world
from January-May 2020. We find that daily electricity demand declined as much
as 10% in April 2020 compared to modelled demand, controlling for weather,
seasonal and temporal effects, but with significant variation. Clustering
techniques show that four impact groups capture systematic differences in
timing and depth of electricity usage changes, ranging from a mild decline of
2% to an extreme decline of 26%. These groupings do not align with geography,
with almost every continent having at least one country or region that
experienced a dramatic reduction in demand and one that did not. Instead, we
find that such changes relate to government restrictions and mobility.
Government restrictions have a non-linear effect on demand that generally
saturates at its most restrictive levels and sustains even as restrictions
ease. Mobility offers a sharper focus on electricity demand change with
workplace and residential mobility strongly linked to demand changes at the
daily level. Steep declines in electricity usage are associated with workday
hourly load patterns that resemble pre-COVID weekend usage. Quantifying these
impacts is a crucial first step in understanding the impacts of crises like the
pandemic and the associated societal response on electricity demand.

channel is estimated using linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator.
Under such circumstances, the channel estimation error is Gaussian which allows
for the use of the convex Gaussian min-max theorem (CGMT) to derive asymptotic
approximations for the MSE and SER when the system dimensions and the coherence
duration grow large with the same pace. The obtained expressions are then
leveraged to derive the optimal power distribution between pilot and data under
a total transmit energy constraint. In addition, we derive an asymptotic
approximation of the goodput for all schemes which is then used to jointly
optimize the number of training symbols and their associated power. Numerical
results are presented to support the accuracy of the theoretical results.

proposed method can greatly reduce the residual noise while keeping the target
speech undistorted by leveraging on the RNN-predicted frame-wise beamforming

construction of huge Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by mining from large-scale text

caused by automatic extraction. To validate the correctness of facts (i.e.,
triplets) inside a KG, one possible approach is to map the triplets into vector
representations by capturing the semantic meanings of facts. Although many
representation learning approaches have been developed for knowledge graphs,
these methods are not effective for validation. They usually assume that facts
are correct, and thus may overfit noisy facts and fail to detect such facts.
Towards effective KG validation, we propose to leverage an external
human-curated KG as auxiliary information source to help detect the errors in a
target KG. The external KG is built upon human-curated knowledge repositories
and tends to have high precision. On the other hand, although the target KG
built by information extraction from texts has low precision, it can cover new
or domain-specific facts that are not in any human-curated repositories. To
tackle this challenging task, we propose a cross-graph representation learning
framework, i.e., CrossVal, which can leverage an external KG to validate the
facts in the target KG efficiently. This is achieved by embedding triplets
based on their semantic meanings, drawing cross-KG negative samples and
estimating a confidence score for each triplet based on its degree of
correctness. We evaluate the proposed framework on datasets across different
domains. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves the
best performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods on large-scale KGs.

a traditional directed preferential attachment, every new edge is added
sequentially into the network. However, for real datasets, it is common to only
have coarse timestamps available, which means several new edges are created at
the same timestamp. Previous analyses on the evolution of social networks
reveal that after reaching a stable phase, the growth of edge counts in a
network follows a non-homogeneous Poisson process with a constant rate across
the day but varying rates from day to day. Taking such empirical observations
into account, we propose a modified preferential attachment model with Poisson

fitted to real datasets, and we see it provides a better fit than the

The model then learns separate prototype coefficients within the class agnostic

made Quality of Experience (QoE) of the end user the focus of the research
community. In contrast, Internet service providers are concerned about
maximizing revenue by accepting as many sessions as possible, as long as
customers remain satisfied. However, there is still no entirely satisfactory
admission algorithm for flows with variable rate. The trade-off between the
number of sessions and perceived QoE can be optimized by exploiting the bursty
nature of video traffic. This paper proposes a novel algorithm to determine the
upper limit of the aggregate video rate that can exceed the available bandwidth
without degrading the QoE of accepted video sessions. A parameter $\beta$ that
defines the exceedable limit is defined. The proposed algorithm results in
accepting more sessions without compromising the QoE of on-going video

individual events to infer the rate, spin, mass, mass-ratio and redshift
distributions of the mergers. The existing population does not discriminate
between random spins with a spread in the effective spin parameter, and a small
but nonzero fraction of events from tidally-torqued stellar progenitors. The
mass distribution is consistent with one having a cutoff at $m_{\rm max} =
41^{+10}_{-5}\,\rm M_\odot$, while the mass ratio favors equal masses; the mean
mass ratio $\bar q> 0.67$. The rate shows no significant evolution with
redshift. We show that the merger rate restricted to BBHs with a primary mass

0.2$, is 1.5 to $5.3\,{\rm Gpc^{-3} yr^{-1}}$ (90\% c.l.); these bounds are
model independent and a factor of $\sim 3$ tighter than that on the local rate

adversarial training in a collaborative learning framework whereby we train a

Furthermore, the natural model acts as a regularizer, enforcing priors on
features that the robust model should learn. Our analyses on the behavior of
the models show that ACT leads to a robust model with lower model complexity,
higher information compression in the learned representations, and high
posterior entropy solutions indicative of convergence to a flatter minima. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across different

binding of a therapeutic particle to receptors on a specific cell membrane,
followed by transport of the particle across the membrane. In this article, we
address some of the challenges in controlling the thermodynamics and dynamics
of these two processes by combining a simple experimental system with a
statistical mechanical model. Specifically, we characterize and model
multivalent ligand-receptor binding between colloidal particles and fluid lipid
bilayers, as well as the surface mobility of membrane-bound particles. We show
that the mobility of the receptors within the fluid membrane is key to both the
thermodynamics and dynamics of binding. First, we find that the
particle-membrane binding free energy -- or avidity -- is a strongly nonlinear
function of the ligand-receptor affinity. We attribute the nonlinearity to a
combination of multivalency and recruitment of fluid receptors to the binding
site. Our results also suggest that partial wrapping of the bound particles by
the membrane enhances avidity further. Second, we demonstrate that the lateral
mobility of membrane-bound particles is also strongly influenced by the
recruitment of receptors. Specifically, we find that the lateral diffusion
coefficient of a membrane-bound particle is dominated by the hydrodynamic drag
against the aggregate of receptors within the membrane. These results provide
one of the first direct validations of the working theoretical framework for
multivalent interactions. They also highlight that the fluidity and elasticity
of the membrane are as important as the ligand-receptor affinity in determining
the binding and transport of small particles attached to membranes.

system is said to be safe if state trajectories avoid some unsafe region of the
statespace for all time. An assured controller is one that enforces safety
online by filtering a desired control input at runtime, and control barrier
functions (CBFs) provide an assured controller that renders a safe subset of
the state-space forward invariant. Recent extensions propose CBF-based assured
controllers that allow the system to leave a known safe set so long as a given
backup control strategy eventually returns to the safe set, however, these
methods have yet to be extended to consider systems subjected to unknown
disturbance inputs.
  In this work, we present a problem formulation for CBF-based runtime
assurance for systems with disturbances, and controllers which solve this
problem must, in some way, incorporate the online computation of reachable
sets. In general, computing reachable sets in the presence of disturbances is
computationally costly and cannot be directly incorporated in a CBF framework.
To that end, we present a particular solution to the problem, whereby reachable
sets are approximated via the mixed-monotonicity property. Efficient algorithms

the so-called phonon melting, are still under debate. Here, time-of-flight

power systems. Most of the existing researches on day-ahead load forecasting
try to build a good model to improve the forecasting accuracy. The forecasted
load is then used as the input to generation scheduling with the ultimate goal
of minimizing the cost of generation schedules. However, existing day-ahead
load forecasting models do not consider this ultimate goal at the
training/forecasting stage. This paper proposes a task-based day-ahead load
forecasting model labeled as LfEdNet that combines two individual layers in one
model, including a load forecasting layer based on deep neural network (Lf
layer) and a day-ahead stochastic economic dispatch (SED) layer (Ed layer). The
training of LfEdNet aims to minimize the cost of the day-ahead SED in the Ed
layer by updating the parameters of the Lf layer. Sequential quadratic
programming (SQP) is used to solve the day-ahead SED in the Ed layer. The test
results demonstrate that the forecasted results produced by LfEdNet can lead to
lower cost of day-ahead SED while maintaining a relatively high forecasting
accuracy.

limited number of organ or tissue label classes annotated, even when the images
have wide anatomical coverage. With supervised learning, multiple classifiers
are usually needed given these partially annotated datasets. In this work, we
propose a set of strategies to train one single classifier in segmenting all
label classes that are heterogeneously annotated across multiple datasets
without moving into semi-supervised learning. Methods: Masks were first created
from each label image through a process we termed presence masking. Three
presence masking modes were evaluated, differing mainly in weightage assigned
to the annotated and unannotated classes. These masks were then applied to the
loss function during training to remove the influence of unannotated classes.
Results: Evaluation against publicly available CT datasets shows that presence
masking is a viable method for training class-generic classifiers. Our
class-generic classifier can perform as well as multiple class-specific
classifiers combined, while the training duration is similar to that required
for one class-specific classifier. Furthermore, the class-generic classifier
can outperform the class-specific classifiers when trained on smaller datasets.
Finally, consistent results are observed from evaluations against human thigh
and calf MRI datasets collected in-house. Conclusion: The evaluation outcomes
show that presence masking is capable of significantly improving both training
and inference efficiency across imaging modalities and anatomical regions.
Improved performance may even be observed on small datasets. Significance:
Presence masking strategies can reduce the computational resources and costs
involved in manual medical image annotations. All codes are publicly available
at https://github.com/wong-ck/DeepSegment.

various domains, it is well known now that a set of DNN models trained with the
same model specification and the same data can produce very different
prediction results. Ensemble method is one state-of-the-art benchmark for
prediction uncertainty estimation. However, ensembles are expensive to train
and serve for web-scale traffic.
  In this paper, we seek to advance the understanding of prediction variation
estimated by the ensemble method. Through empirical experiments on two widely
used benchmark datasets MovieLens and Criteo in recommender systems, we observe
that prediction variations come from various randomness sources, including
training data shuffling, and parameter random initialization. By introducing
more randomness into model training, we notice that ensemble's mean predictions
tend to be more accurate while the prediction variations tend to be higher.
Moreover, we propose to infer prediction variation from neuron activation
strength and demonstrate the strong prediction power from activation strength
features. Our experiment results show that the average R squared on MovieLens
is as high as 0.56 and on Criteo is 0.81. Our method performs especially well
when detecting the lowest and highest variation buckets, with 0.92 AUC and 0.89
AUC respectively. Our approach provides a simple way for prediction variation
estimation, which opens up new opportunities for future work in many
interesting areas (e.g.,model-based reinforcement learning) without relying on
serving expensive ensemble models.

Friedel screening theorem for both valences. Such a model is shown, following
earlier work which showed low energy singularities in it, to be supersymmetric,
leading to a free Majorana and a phase-shifted Majorana excitation. The theory
extended approximately to a lattice of mixed-valence ions at appropriate
filling gives, without fine-tuning the parameters, a protected gapless Majorana
fermion band across the chemical potential, besides the mixed-valence particle
and hole bands separated by gaps. In this situation the system is electrically
neutral in linear response but has de Haas-van Alphen oscillations. This is
used to explain the recently observed magneto-oscillations in mixed-valence
insulators as well as their accompanying low energy thermodynamic and
relaxation rate anomalies. Some predictions to test the validity of the
theoretical results are provided, the most striking of which is that there
should be extensive ground state entropy in such compounds.

  Vectors","Accepted to WACV2021",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Oriented object detection in aerial images is a challenging task as the
objects in aerial images are displayed in arbitrary directions and are usually
densely packed. Current oriented object detection methods mainly rely on
two-stage anchor-based detectors. However, the anchor-based detectors typically
suffer from a severe imbalance issue between the positive and negative anchor
boxes. To address this issue, in this work we extend the horizontal
keypoint-based object detector to the oriented object detection task. In
particular, we first detect the center keypoints of the objects, based on which
we then regress the box boundary-aware vectors (BBAVectors) to capture the
oriented bounding boxes. The box boundary-aware vectors are distributed in the
four quadrants of a Cartesian coordinate system for all arbitrarily oriented
objects. To relieve the difficulty of learning the vectors in the corner cases,
we further classify the oriented bounding boxes into horizontal and rotational
bounding boxes. In the experiment, we show that learning the box boundary-aware
vectors is superior to directly predicting the width, height, and angle of an
oriented bounding box, as adopted in the baseline method. Besides, the proposed
method competes favorably with state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

have largely focused on continuous or binary outcomes, and have been relatively
less vetted with survival outcomes. Using flexible machine learning methods in
the counterfactual framework is a promising approach to address challenges due
to complex individual characteristics, to which treatments need to be tailored.
To evaluate the operating characteristics of recent survival machine learning
methods for the estimation of treatment effect heterogeneity and inform better
practice, we carry out a comprehensive simulation study presenting a wide range
of settings describing confounded heterogeneous survival treatment effects and
varying degrees of covariate overlap. Our results suggest that the
nonparametric Bayesian Additive Regression Trees within the framework of
accelerated failure time model (AFT-BART-NP) consistently yields the best
performance, in terms of bias, precision and expected regret. Moreover, the
credible interval estimators from AFT-BART-NP provide close to nominal
frequentist coverage for the individual survival treatment effect when the
covariate overlap is at least moderate. Including a non-parametrically
estimated propensity score as an additional fixed covariate in the AFT-BART-NP
model formulation can further improve its efficiency and frequentist coverage.
Finally, we demonstrate the application of flexible causal machine learning
estimators through a comprehensive case study examining the heterogeneous
survival effects of two radiotherapy approaches for localized high-risk

  Analysis and Implications",,,,,"cs.CY cs.IR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most work to date on mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is focused urgently on
biomedicine and epidemiology. Yet, pandemic-related policy decisions cannot be
made on health information alone. Decisions need to consider the broader
impacts on people and their needs. Quantifying human needs across the
population is challenging as it requires high geo-temporal granularity, high
coverage across the population, and appropriate adjustment for seasonal and
other external effects. Here, we propose a computational methodology, building
on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, that can capture a holistic view of relative
changes in needs following the pandemic through a difference-in-differences
approach that corrects for seasonality and volume variations. We apply this
approach to characterize changes in human needs across physiological,
socioeconomic, and psychological realms in the US, based on more than 35
billion search interactions spanning over 36,000 ZIP codes over a period of 14
months. The analyses reveal that the expression of basic human needs has
increased exponentially while higher-level aspirations declined during the
pandemic in comparison to the pre-pandemic period. In exploring the timing and
variations in statewide policies, we find that the durations of
shelter-in-place mandates have influenced social and emotional needs
significantly. We demonstrate that potential barriers to addressing critical
needs, such as support for unemployment and domestic violence, can be
identified through web search interactions. Our approach and results suggest
that population-scale monitoring of shifts in human needs can inform policies
and recovery efforts for current and anticipated needs.

the plasma-$\beta$, the ratio between gas pressure and magnetic pressure, is
low ($\beta < 1$). As often seen in adiabatic MHD simulations of rotating
disks, the direction of the mean toroidal field periodically reverses with time
even in multiphase gas structures. The direction reversal is caused by magnetic

particles by using an air waveguide sandwiched between two chiral hyperbolic
metamaterials. The pulling force is induced by mode conversion between a pair
of one-way-transport surface-arc waves supported on the two metamaterial
surfaces of the waveguide. The surface arcs bridge the momentum gaps between
isolated bulk equifrequency surfaces (EFSs) and are topologically protected by
the nontrivial Chern numbers of the EFSs. When an incident surface-arc wave
with a relatively small wavenumber $k_{x1}$ is scattered by the particle, a
part of its energy is transferred to the other surface-arc mode with
$k_{x2}(>k_{x1}). Because the electromagnetic wave acquires an additional
forward momentum from the particle proportional to $k_{x2}-k_{x1}$ during this
process, the particle will always be subjected to an optical pulling force
irrespective of its material, shape and size. Since the chiral surface-arc
waves are immune to backscattering from local disorders and the metamaterials
are isotropic in the xy plane, robust optical pulling can be achieved in a
curved air waveguide and can go beyond standard optical pulling mechanisms
which are limited to pull in a straight-line.

be capable of modelling a number of practical instances. In this paper, we
examine the dynamical outcomes of moving agents interacting based upon their
physical proximity. For this, we particularly emphasize on the impact of
competing interactions among the agents depending on their physical distance.
We specifically assume attractive coupling between agents which are staying
apart from each other, whereas we adopt repulsive interaction for agents that
are sufficiently close in space. With this set-up, we consider two types of
coupling configurations, symmetry-breaking and symmetry-preserving couplings.
We encounter variants of collective dynamics ranging from synchronization,
inhomogeneous small oscillation to cluster state and extreme events while
changing the attractive and repulsive coupling strengths. We have been able to
map all these dynamical behaviors in the coupling parameter space. Complete
synchronization being the most desired state in absence of repulsive coupling,
we present an analytical study for this scenario that agrees well with the
numerical results.

This would be an interesting test of general relativity (GR), since GR predicts

of polarizations is limited by the available number of linearly independent
detectors in the network. (To extract all polarization modes, there should be
at least as many detectors as the polarization modes.) Strong gravitational
lensing of GWs offers a possibility to significantly increase the effective
number of detectors in the network. Due to strong lensing (e.g., by galaxies),
multiple copies of the same signal can be observed with time delays of several

a pair of one-way chiral surface waves supported on the interface between two

spinning velocities embedded in water. When the chiral surface mode with a
relative small Bloch wave vector is excited, the particle located in the
interface waveguide will scatter the excited surface mode to another chiral
surface mode with a greater Bloch wave vector, resulting in an acoustic pulling
force, irrespective of the size and material of the particle. Thanks to the
backscattering immunity of the chiral surface waves against local disorders,
the particle can be pulled following a flexible trajectory as determined by the
shape of the interface. As such, this new acoustic pulling scheme overcomes
some of the limitations of the traditional acoustic pulling using structured
beams, such as short pulling distances, straight-line type pulling and strong
dependence on the scattering properties of the particle. Our work may also
inspire the application of topological acoustics to acoustic manipulations.

patient data privacy, the computation is preferably done on local hardware.
State-of-the-art MRI segmentation methods mostly focus on accuracy only, and
can hardly be adopted for real-time application or on local hardware. In this

the architecture parameters, so that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can be
used for optimization to reduce the computation cost while maintaining
optimization quality. Experimental results on ACDC MICCAI 2017 dataset

achieving competitive segmentation accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art

exploited, real-time OD cannot always be guaranteed due to dynamic channel
quality. To mitigate this problem, we propose an edge network-assisted
real-time OD framework~(EODF). In an EODF, AVs extract the region of
interests~(RoIs) of the captured image when the channel quality is not
sufficiently good for supporting real-time OD. Then, AVs compress the image
data on the basis of the RoIs and transmit the compressed one to the edge
cloud. In so doing, real-time OD can be achieved owing to the reduced
transmission latency. To verify the feasibility of our framework, we evaluate
the probability that the results of OD are not received within the inter-frame
duration (i.e., outage probability) and their accuracy. From the evaluation, we
demonstrate that the proposed EODF provides the results to AVs in real-time and
achieves satisfactory accuracy.

sequence of simpler sub-tasks. For instance, opening a door requires reaching,
grasping, rotating, and pulling the door knob. Such compositional tasks require
an agent to reason about the sub-task at hand while orchestrating global
behavior accordingly. This can be cast as an online task inference problem,
where the current task identity, represented by a context variable, is
estimated from the agent's past experiences with probabilistic inference.
Previous approaches have employed simple latent distributions, e.g., Gaussian,
to model a single context for the entire task. However, this formulation lacks
the expressiveness to capture the composition and transition of the sub-tasks.
We propose a variational inference framework OCEAN to perform online task
inference for compositional tasks. OCEAN models global and local context
variables in a joint latent space, where the global variables represent a
mixture of sub-tasks required for the task, while the local variables capture
the transitions between the sub-tasks. Our framework supports flexible latent
distributions based on prior knowledge of the task structure and can be trained
in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results show that OCEAN provides more
effective task inference with sequential context adaptation and thus leads to a
performance boost on complex, multi-stage tasks.

In fact, our protocol simultaneously achieves the asymptotically-perfect charge
and almost $N$-order average power enhancement with only thermal energy
resource and simple local interactions in a stable manner. The capacity is
collectively enhanced due to the emergent bosonic quantum statistics caused by
the symmetry of the interaction between the engine and the batteries, which
results in asymptotically perfect excitation of all the TLSs. The charging
speed, and hence the average power are collectively enhanced by the
superradiance-like cooperative excitation in the effective negative

algorithms have been introduced to segment brain tumors and achieve an
expert-like accuracy. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) have recently
shown very promising results, however, DCNN models are still far from achieving
clinically meaningful results mainly because of the lack of generalization of
the models. DCNN models need large annotated datasets to achieve good
performance. Models are often optimized on the domain dataset on which they
have been trained, and then fail the task when the same model is applied to
different datasets from different institutions. One of the reasons is due to
the lack of data standardization to adjust for different models and MR
machines. In this work, a 3D Spherical coordinates transform during the
pre-processing phase has been hypothesized to improve DCNN models' accuracy and
to allow more generalizable results even when the model is trained on small and
heterogeneous datasets and translated into different domains. Indeed, the
spherical coordinate system avoids several standardization issues since it
works independently of resolution and imaging settings. Both Cartesian and
spherical volumes were evaluated in two DCNN models with the same network
structure using the BraTS 2019 dataset. The model trained on spherical
transform pre-processed inputs resulted in superior performance over the
Cartesian-input trained model on predicting gliomas' segmentation on tumor core
and enhancing tumor classes (increase of 0.011 and 0.014 respectively on the
validation dataset), achieving a further improvement in accuracy by merging the
two models together. Furthermore, the spherical transform is not
resolution-dependent and achieve same results on different input resolution.

time-dependent Hartree-Fock method. Further, we report the implementation of
the TD-CC2 method within the chosen active space, which is also a second-order

to reach out to larger chemical systems, especially for the study of
strong-field dynamics. The obtained results indicate that the TD-OMP2 method
shows moderate performance, overestimating the response of Ne, while TDHF
underestimates it. Nevertheless, it is remarkable that stable computation of

nonperturbative inclusion of the laser-electron interaction and time-dependent
optimization of orbitals.

which will form the basis of a compactness, partial regularity and structure
theory for Ricci flows in [Bam20a, Bam20b].
  The bounds are optimal up to a constant that only depends on the dimension
and possibly a lower scalar curvature bound. In the special case in which the
flow consists of Einstein metrics, these bounds agree with the optimal bounds
for spaces with Ricci curvature bounded from below. Moreover, our bounds are
local in the sense that if a bound depends on the collapsedness of the
underlying flow, then we are able to quantify this dependence using the pointed
Nash entropy based only at the point in question.
  Among other things, we will show the following bounds: Upper and lower volume
bounds for distance balls, dependence of the pointed Nash entropy on its
basepoint in space and time, pointwise upper Gaussian bound on the heat kernel
and a bound on its derivative and an $L^1$-Poincar\'e inequality. The proofs of
these bounds will, in part, rely on a monotonicity formula for a notion, called
variance of conjugate heat kernels.
  We will also derive estimates concerning the dependence of the pointed Nash
entropy on its basepoint, which are asymptotically optimal. These will allow us
to show that points in spacetime that are nearby in a certain sense have
comparable pointed Nash entropy. Hence the pointed Nash entropy is a good
quantity to measure local collapsedness of a Ricci flow

result of Hein and Naber. Some of our results also hold for super Ricci flows.

traffic and safety management) require group communications between drones to
efficiently disseminate data or reliably deliver critical information, making
use of the line-of-sight coverage of drones to realise services that ground
devices may not be capable of. This paper studies highperformance yet
resource-efficient mobile drone multicasting via trajectory adjustment. We
first analyse the trajectory adjustment condition to determine whether a
straight-line trajectory is fully covered by the multicast or not, by
conducting simple computation tasks and with controlled overhead traffic. We
then propose the trajectory adjustment scheme to provide a new trajectory with
controlled travel distances. The ETTA algorithm is finally presented to apply
the trajectory adjustment condition and scheme to a drone transiting between
forwarders whose coverage do not overlap. The algorithm relies on multicasting
forwarders, instead of additional transition forwarders, to fully cover the
adjusted trajectory, helping to control interference and network traffic load.
Our NS2 simulation results demonstrate that ETTA, as compared to other mobile
multicasts, can achieve guaranteed performance for drone receivers in a

$d$-dimensional unknown sparse parameter $\theta$ under the normal mean model
$X\sim N(\theta,\sigma^2I)$. A key feature of the proposed confidence set is
its capability to account for the sparsity of $\theta$, thus named as {\em
sparse} confidence set. This is in sharp contrast with the classical methods,
such as Bonferroni confidence intervals and other resampling based procedures,
where the sparsity of $\theta$ is often ignored. Specifically, we require the
desired sparse confidence set to satisfy the following two conditions: (i)
uniformly over the parameter space, the coverage probability for $\theta$ is
above a pre-specified level; (ii) there exists a random subset $S$ of
$\{1,...,d\}$ such that $S$ guarantees the pre-specified true negative rate
(TNR) for detecting nonzero $\theta_j$'s. To exploit the sparsity of $\theta$,
we define that the confidence interval for $\theta_j$ degenerates to a single
point 0 for any $j\notin S$. Under this new framework, we first consider
whether there exist sparse confidence sets that satisfy the above two
conditions. To address this question, we establish a non-asymptotic minimax
lower bound for the non-coverage probability over a suitable class of sparse
confidence sets. The lower bound deciphers the role of sparsity and minimum
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the construction of sparse confidence sets.
Furthermore, under suitable conditions on the SNR, a two-stage procedure is
proposed to construct a sparse confidence set. To evaluate the optimality, the
proposed sparse confidence set is shown to attain a minimax lower bound of some
properly defined risk function up to a constant factor. Finally, we develop an
adaptive procedure to the unknown sparsity and SNR. Numerical studies are
conducted to verify the theoretical results.

iterations, which is based on the support vector machine (SVM). The SVM
classifier uses our original kernel function designed as reflecting the
symmetries of both host crystal and interstitial species. The most distant
unobserved point on the classification boundaries from the observed points is
sampled as the next initial point for local optimization. The proposed method
is applied to three model cases, i.e., the six-hump camelback function, a
proton in strontium zirconate with the orthorhombic perovskite structure, and a
water molecule in lanthanum sulfate with the monoclinic structure, to
demonstrate the high performance of the proposed method.

discard malware variants that do not correctly execute in sandbox environments.
In this work, we overcome these limitations by developing a unifying framework
that does not only encompass and generalize previous attacks against
machine-learning models, but also includes three novel attacks based on
practical, functionality-preserving manipulations to the Windows Portable
Executable (PE) file format. These attacks, named Full DOS, Extend and Shift,
inject the adversarial payload by respectively manipulating the DOS header,
extending it, and shifting the content of the first section. Our experimental
results show that these attacks outperform existing ones in both white-box and
black-box scenarios, achieving a better trade-off in terms of evasion rate and
size of the injected payload, while also enabling evasion of models that have
been shown to be robust to previous attacks. To facilitate reproducibility of
our findings, we open source our framework and all the corresponding attack

edge of the Internet-of-Things is a critical enabler to support pervasive Deep
Learning-enhanced applications. Low-Cost MCU-based end-nodes have limited
on-chip memory and often replace caches with scratchpads, to reduce area
overheads and increase energy efficiency -- requiring explicit DMA-based memory
transfers between different levels of the memory hierarchy. Mapping modern DNNs
on these systems requires aggressive topology-dependent tiling and
double-buffering. In this work, we propose DORY (Deployment Oriented to memoRY)
- an automatic tool to deploy DNNs on low cost MCUs with typically less than
1MB of on-chip SRAM memory. DORY abstracts tiling as a Constraint Programming
(CP) problem: it maximizes L1 memory utilization under the topological
constraints imposed by each DNN layer. Then, it generates ANSI C code to
orchestrate off- and on-chip transfers and computation phases. Furthermore, to
maximize speed, DORY augments the CP formulation with heuristics promoting
performance-effective tile sizes. As a case study for DORY, we target
GreenWaves Technologies GAP8, one of the most advanced parallel ultra-low power
MCU-class devices on the market. On this device, DORY achieves up to 2.5x
better MAC/cycle than the GreenWaves proprietary software solution and 18.1x
better than the state-of-the-art result on an STM32-F746 MCU on single layers.
Using our tool, GAP-8 can perform end-to-end inference of a 1.0-MobileNet-128

iteratively at the input end of the renderer as suggested by previous methods,
which are time-consuming, we introduce a facial parameter translator so that
the creation can be done efficiently through a single forward propagation from
the face embeddings to parameters, with a considerable 1000x computational
speedup. Despite its high efficiency, the interactivity is preserved in our
method where users are allowed to optionally fine-tune the facial parameters on

because of exceedingly long transient features or strong quantum correlations
in the dynamics. Here, we develop an efficient quantum algorithm for the direct
estimation of averaged expectation values of observables on the non-equilibrium

algorithm encodes the vectorized representation of the density matrix on a

dynamics. We show that the output state of the algorithm allows to estimate
expectation values of observables on the steady state. Away from critical

parallel structure to be implemented efficiently on the distributed many-core
Sunway TaihuLight supercomputer. Random quantum circuits can be simulated with
40, 75 and 200 qubits on the full, partial and single amplitude, respectively.

transcendental functions. Our simulator is expected to have broader

the algorithms in a highly parallel and flexible way to ensure the efficiency

We utilize operations per second (OPS), which is measured in an analytical and

frozen (fixed) argument appearing, in particular, in modelling various physical
systems with feedback. The presence of a feedback means that the external
affect on the system depends on its current state. If this state is taken into
account only at some fixed physical point, then mathematically this corresponds
to an operator with frozen argument. In the present paper, we consider the
operator $Ly\equiv-y''(x)+q(x)y(a),$ $y^{(\nu)}(0)=\gamma y^{(\nu)}(1),$
$\nu=0,1,$ where $\gamma\in{\mathbb C}\setminus\{0\}.$ The operator $L$ is a
nonlocal analog of the classical Hill operator describing various processes in
cyclic or periodic media. We study two inverse problems of recovering the
complex-valued square-integrable potential $q(x)$ from some spectral
information about $L.$ The first problem involves only single spectrum as the
input data. We obtain complete characterization of the spectrum and prove that
its specification determines $q(x)$ uniquely if and only if $\gamma\ne\pm1.$
For the rest (periodic and antiperiodic) cases, we describe classes of
iso-spectral potentials and provide restrictions under which the uniqueness
holds. The second inverse problem deals with recovering $q(x)$ from the two
spectra related to $\gamma=\pm1.$ We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions
for its solvability and establish that uniqueness holds if and only if $a=0,1.$
For $a\in(0,1),$ we describe classes of iso-bispectral potentials and give
restrictions under which the uniqueness resumes. Algorithms for solving both
inverse problems are provided. In the appendix, we prove Riesz-basisness of an
auxiliary two-sided sequence of sines.

$\delta \approx 0.5$, falling within the range of the earthquakes' $\delta =

applications. To segment multiple organs of interest, it is generally quite
difficult to collect full annotations of all the organs on the same images, as
some medical centers might only annotate a portion of the organs due to their
own clinical practice. In most scenarios, one might obtain annotations of a
single or a few organs from one training set, and obtain annotations of the the
other organs from another set of training images. Existing approaches mostly
train and deploy a single model for each subset of organs, which are memory
intensive and also time inefficient. In this paper, we propose to co-train
weight-averaged models for learning a unified multi-organ segmentation network
from few-organ datasets. We collaboratively train two networks and let the
coupled networks teach each other on un-annotated organs. To alleviate the
noisy teaching supervisions between the networks, the weighted-averaged models
are adopted to produce more reliable soft labels. In addition, a novel region
mask is utilized to selectively apply the consistent constraint on the
un-annotated organ regions that require collaborative teaching, which further
boosts the performance. Extensive experiments on three public available
single-organ datasets LiTS, KiTS, Pancreas and manually-constructed
single-organ datasets from MOBA show that our method can better utilize the
few-organ datasets and achieves superior performance with less inference
computational cost.

taken special measures, MOCVD suffers from some serious drawbacks, such as
small domain size and carbon contamination, resulting in poor optical and
crystal quality, which may inhibit its implementation for the large-scale

(GE-MOCVD) methodology, in which a small amount of water vapor is introduced
during the growth, while the precursors are delivered in pulses. The evolution
of the growth as a function of the amount of water vapor, the number and type
of cycles and the gas composition is described. We show a significant domain
size increase is achieved relative to our conventional process. The improved
crystal quality of WS2 (and WSe2) domains was demonstrated by means of Raman
spectroscopy, photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy and HRTEM studies. Moreover,
time-resolved PL studies show very long exciton lifetimes, comparable to those
observed in mechanically exfoliated flakes. Thus, the GE-MOCVD approach
presented here may facilitate their integration into a wide range of

Role-Playing Games (RPGs), where players can edit the appearance of their

automatically creating in-game characters with a single photo. In recent
literature on this topic, neural networks are introduced to make game engine
differentiable and the self-supervised learning is used to predict facial
customization parameters. However, in previous methods, the expression
parameters and facial identity parameters are highly coupled with each other,
making it difficult to model the intrinsic facial features of the character.
Besides, the neural network based renderer used in previous methods is also
difficult to be extended to multi-view rendering cases. In this paper,
considering the above problems, we propose a novel method named ""PokerFace-GAN""
for neutral face game character auto-creation. We first build a differentiable
character renderer which is more flexible than the previous methods in
multi-view rendering cases. We then take advantage of the adversarial training
to effectively disentangle the expression parameters from the identity
parameters and thus generate player-preferred neutral face (expression-less)
characters. Since all components of our method are differentiable, our method
can be easily trained under a multi-task self-supervised learning paradigm.
Experiment results show that our method can generate vivid neutral face game
characters that are highly similar to the input photos. The effectiveness of
our method is verified by comparison results and ablation studies.

into analyzing data and extracting valuable information. Cloud computing used
to be a good technology to solve a large number of data analysis problems.
However, in the era of the popularity of the Internet of Things (IoT),
transmitting sensing data back to the cloud for centralized data analysis will
consume a lot of wireless communication and network transmission costs. To
solve the above problems, edge computing has become a promising solution. In
this paper, we propose a new algorithm for processing probabilistic skyline
queries over uncertain data streams in an edge computing environment. We use
the concept of a second skyline set to filter data that is unlikely to be the
result of the skyline. Besides, the edge server only sends the information
needed to update the global analysis results on the cloud server, which will
greatly reduce the amount of data transmitted over the network. The results
show that our proposed method not only reduces the response time by more than
50% compared with the brute force method on two-dimensional data but also
maintains the leading processing speed on high-dimensional data.

industrially relevant process simulation has revealed the complex interplay
between microstructural development and the micromechanical behaviour. As
sample gauge volumes were smaller than the length scale of the highly cored
structure of the parent material from which they were produced, their subtle
composition differences gave rise to differing work hardening rates, influenced
by varying secondary dendrite arm spacings, gamma-prime phase solvus
temperatures and a topologically inverted gamma/gamma-prime microstructure. The
gamma-prime precipitates possessed a characteristic `X' morphology, resulting
from the simultaneously active solute transport mechanisms of thermally
favoured octodendritic growth and N-type rafting, indicating creep-type
mechanisms were prevalent. High resolution-electron backscatter diffraction
(HR-EBSD) characterisation reveals deformation patterning that follows the
gamma/gamma-prime microstructure, with high geometrically necessary dislocation
density fields localised to the gamma/gamma-prime interfaces; Orowan looping is
evidently the mechanism that mediated plasticity. Examination of the residual
elastic stresses indicated the `X' gamma-prime precipitate morphology had
significantly enhanced the deformation heterogeneity, resulting in stress
states within the gamma channels that favour slip, and that encourage further
growth of gamma-prime precipitate protrusions. The combination of such
localised plasticity and residual stresses are considered to be critical in the
formation of the recrystallisation defect in subsequent post-casting
homogenisation heat treatments.

quantum adiabatic process for a one-dimensional free fermion system described
by a variational wave function, i.e., a parametrized quantum circuit. The wave
function is composed of $M$ layers of two elementary sets of time-evolution
operators, each set being decomposed into commutable local operators. The
evolution time of each time-evolution operator is treated as a variational
parameter so as to minimize the expectation value of the energy. We show that
the exact ground state is reached by applying the layers of time-evolution
operators as many as a quarter of the system size. This is the minimum number
$M_B$ of layers set by the limit of speed, i.e., the Lieb-Robinson bound, for
propagating quantum entanglement via the local time-evolution operators.
Quantities such as the energy $E$ and the entanglement entropy $S$ of the
optimized variational wave function with $M < M_B$ are independent of the
system size $L$ but fall into some universal functions of $M$. The development
of the entanglement in these ansatz is further manifested in the progressive
propagation of single-particle orbitals in the variational wave function. We
also find that the optimized variational parameters show a systematic structure
that provides the optimum scheduling function in the quantum adiabatic process.
We also investigate the imaginary-time evolution of this variational wave
function, where the causality relation is absent due to the non-unitarity of
the imaginary-time evolution operators, thus the norm of the wave function
being no longer conserved. We find that the convergence to the exact ground
state is exponentially fast, despite that the system is at the critical point,
suggesting that implementation of the non-unitary imaginary-time evolution in a
quantum circuit is highly promising to further shallow the circuit depth.

their upper cut-off frequencies appear to be dependent on the stellar
orientation with respect to the line of sight. We suggest that all these
phenomena, which are beyond the ideal picture, can be attributed to a highly
azimuthally asymmetric matter distribution in the magnetosphere about the
magnetic field axis, which is a consequence of both the high obliquity (the
angle between rotation axis and the magnetic field axis) of the star and the

services that consumers and businesses use daily. These services run on a large
datacenters and are required to meet predefined Service Level Objectives (SLO),
or latency targets, with high probability. Thus, efficient datacenter
applications should optimize their execution in terms of power and performance.
However, to support large scale data storage, these workloads make heavy use of
pointer connected data structures (e.g., hash table, large fan-out tree, trie)
and exhibit poor instruction and memory level parallelism. Our experiments show
that due to long memory access latency, these workloads occupy processor
resources (e.g., ROB entries, RS buffers, LS queue entries etc.) for a
prolonged period of time that delay the processing of subsequent requests.
Delayed execution not only increases request processing latency, but also
severely effects an application throughput and power-efficiency. To overcome
this limitation, we present CARGO, a novel mechanism to overlap queuing latency
and request processing by executing select instructions on an application
critical path at the network interface card (NIC) while requests wait for
processor resources to become available. Our mechanism dynamically identifies
the critical instructions and includes the register state needed to compute the
long latency memory accesses. This context-augmented critical region is often
executed at the NIC well before execution begins at the core, effectively
prefetching the data ahead of time. Across a variety of interactive datacenter
applications, our proposal improves latency, throughput, and power efficiency

observables, which are shown to be warps, lopsidedness and/or
kinematic-photometric position angle misalignments. We estimate the magnitude
of the tidal-like effects needed to reproduce the observed warp and
lopsidedness on the isolated galaxy IC 2487. Within a realistic range of dark
matter distribution properties the observed warped and lopsided kinematical
properties of IC 2487 is possible to reproduce (the background medium of dark

properties of items. Collaborative recommender methods usually represent an
item as one single latent vector. Nowadays the e-commercial platforms provide
various kinds of attribute information for items (e.g., category, price and
style of clothing). Utilizing these attribute information for better item
representations is popular in recent years. Some studies use the given
attribute information as side information, which is concatenated with the item
latent vector to augment representations. However, the mixed item
representations fail to fully exploit the rich attribute information or provide
explanation in recommender systems. To this end, we propose a fine-grained
Disentangled Item Representation (DIR) for recommender systems in this paper,
where the items are represented as several separated attribute vectors instead
of a single latent vector. In this way, the items are represented at the
attribute level, which can provide fine-grained information of items in
recommendation. We introduce a learning strategy, LearnDIR, which can allocate
the corresponding attribute vectors to items. We show how DIR can be applied to
two typical models, Matrix Factorization (MF) and Recurrent Neural Network
(RNN). Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that the models
developed under the framework of DIR are effective and efficient. Even using
fewer parameters, the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art
methods, especially in the cold-start situation. In addition, we make
visualizations to show that our proposition can provide explanation for users
in real-world applications.

the reasonable explosion energy of $E_{\mathrm{exp}} = 2.8 \times 10^{51}$ erg

problem with communication efficiency and privacy requirements, motivated by
the federated learning (FL) framework. Unique challenges to the traditional ERM

clients' data, (ii) compress the communication between clients and the server,
since clients might have low-bandwidth links, (iii) work with a dynamic client
population at each round of communication between the server and the clients,
as a small fraction of clients are sampled at each round. To address these
challenges we develop (optimal) communication-efficient schemes for private
mean estimation for several $\ell_p$ spaces, enabling efficient gradient
aggregation for each iteration of the optimization solution of the ERM. We also
provide lower and upper bounds for mean estimation with privacy and
communication constraints for arbitrary $\ell_p$ spaces. To get the overall
communication, privacy, and optimization performance operation point, we
combine this with privacy amplification opportunities inherent to this setup.
Our solution takes advantage of the inherent privacy amplification provided by
client sampling and data sampling at each client (through Stochastic Gradient

anonymization, which effectively presents to the server responses that are
randomly shuffled with respect to the clients. Putting these together, we
demonstrate that one can get the same privacy, optimization-performance

recognition of five types of white blood cells. Segmenting complete white blood
cells from blood smears images and extracting advantageous features from them
remain challenging tasks in the classification of white blood cells. Therefore,
we present an adaptive threshold segmentation method to deal with blood smears
images with non-uniform color and uneven illumination, which is designed based
on color space information and threshold segmentation. Subsequently, after
successfully separating the white blood cell from the blood smear image, a
large number of nonlinear features including geometrical, color and texture
features are extracted. Nevertheless, redundant features can affect the
classification speed and efficiency, and in view of that, a feature selection
algorithm based on classification and regression trees (CART) is designed.
Through in-depth analysis of the nonlinear relationship between features, the
irrelevant and redundant features are successfully removed from the initial
nonlinear features. Afterwards, the selected prominent features are fed into
particle swarm optimization support vector machine (PSO-SVM) classifier to
recognize the types of the white blood cells. Finally, to evaluate the
performance of the proposed white blood cell classification methodology, we
build a white blood cell data set containing 500 blood smear images for
experiments. By comparing with the ground truth obtained manually, the proposed
segmentation method achieves an average of 95.98% and 97.57% dice similarity
for segmented nucleus and cell regions respectively. Furthermore, the proposed
methodology achieves 99.76% classification accuracy, which well demonstrates
its effectiveness.

epidemic model has many properties that lie in-between the

a novel quasi-stationary reproduction number that can be used to describe the

for our cluster sample. 937 candidates are found within the cluster aperture
radii, half (450) of which are very likely cluster members. Cross-matching with

visual and LiDAR sensors to provide robust and accurate 6DOF pose estimation
holds great potential in robotics and beyond. In this paper, building upon our
prior work (i.e., LIC-Fusion), we develop a sliding-window filter based
LiDAR-Inertial-Camera odometry with online spatiotemporal calibration (i.e.,
LIC-Fusion 2.0), which introduces a novel sliding-window plane-feature tracking
for efficiently processing 3D LiDAR point clouds. In particular, after motion
compensation for LiDAR points by leveraging IMU data, low-curvature planar
points are extracted and tracked across the sliding window. A novel outlier
rejection criterion is proposed in the plane-feature tracking for high-quality
data association. Only the tracked planar points belonging to the same plane
will be used for plane initialization, which makes the plane extraction
efficient and robust. Moreover, we perform the observability analysis for the
LiDAR-IMU subsystem and report the degenerate cases for spatiotemporal
calibration using plane features. While the estimation consistency and
identified degenerate motions are validated in Monte-Carlo simulations,
different real-world experiments are also conducted to show that the proposed
LIC-Fusion 2.0 outperforms its predecessor and other state-of-the-art methods.

the PAR view's interpretability by human labelers in two different activity

labelers achieved an overall high level of precision in identifying body
motions in exercise tracking of 91% precision and eating/drinking motions at
96% precision. Item interaction identification reached a precision of 86%
precision for labeling grocery categories. We show a high level on the device

including the field predicted by the stellar evolution model. The model with
the weakest magnetic field achieves shock revival due to neutrino heating in a
gain layer characterized by a large-scale, hydrodynamic m = 1 spiral mode.
Later on, the growing magnetic field of the proto-neutron star launches weak
outflows into the early ejecta. Their orientation follows the evolution of the
rotational axis of the proto-neutron star, which starts to tilt from the
original orientation due to the asymmetric accretion flows impinging on its
surface. The models with stronger magnetization generate mildly relativistic,
magnetically driven polar outflows propagating over a distance of $10^4$ km
within a few 100 ms. These jets are stabilized against disruptive
non-axisymmetric instabilities by their fast propagation and by the shear of
their toroidal magnetic field. Within the simulation times of around 1 s, the
explosions reach moderate energies and the growth of the proto-neutron star
masses ceases at values substantially below the threshold for black hole
formation, which, in combination with the high rotational energies, might
suggest a possible later proto-magnetar activity.

on game telemetry? Can we reveal engaging moments of gameplay by observing the
way the viewers of the game behave? To address these questions in this paper,
we reframe the way gameplay engagement is defined and we view it, instead,
through the eyes of a game's live audience. We build prediction models for
viewers' engagement based on data collected from the popular battle royale game
PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds as obtained from the Twitch streaming service. In
particular, we collect viewers' chat logs and in-game telemetry data from
several hundred matches of five popular streamers (containing over 100,000 game
events) and machine learn the mapping between gameplay and viewer chat
frequency during play, using small neural network architectures. Our key
findings showcase that engagement models trained solely on 40 gameplay features
can reach accuracies of up to 80% on average and 84% at best. Our models are
scalable and generalisable as they perform equally well within- and
across-streamers, as well as across streamer play styles.

particle coatings is a common problem, typically solved using polymeric
additives and surface active ingredients, which require further processing of
the dried film. Capillary suspensions with their tunable physical properties,
devoid of polymers, offer new pathways in producing uniform and defect free
particulate coatings.
  Experiments: We investigated the effect of small amounts of secondary liquid
on the coating's drying behavior. Stress build-up and weight loss in a
temperature and humidity controlled drying chamber were simultaneously
measured. Changes in the coating's reflectance and height profile over time
were related with the weight loss and stress curve.
  Findings: Capillary suspensions dry uniformly without defects. Lateral drying
is inhibited by the high yield stress, causing the coating to shrink to an even
height. The bridges between particles prevent air invasion and extend the
constant drying period. The liquid in the lower layers is transported to the
interface via corner flow within surface pores, leading to a partially dry
layer near the substrate while the pores above are still saturated. Using
capillary suspensions for hard particle coatings results in more uniform,
defect free films with better printing characteristics, rendering high additive
content obsolete.

related fields. In many modern applications, the inference based on latent
variable models involves one or several of the following features: (1) the
presence of many latent variables, (2) the observed and latent variables being
continuous, discrete, or a combination of both, (3) constraints on parameters,
and (4) penalties on parameters to impose model parsimony. The estimation often
involves maximizing an objective function based on a marginal
likelihood/pseudo-likelihood, possibly with constraints and/or penalties on
parameters. Solving this optimization problem is highly non-trivial, due to the
complexities brought by the features mentioned above. Although several
efficient algorithms have been proposed, there lacks a unified computational
framework that takes all these features into account. In this paper, we fill
the gap. Specifically, we provide a unified formulation for the optimization

Theoretical properties of the proposed algorithms are established. The
computational efficiency and robustness are shown by simulation studies under

  ""Super-clustering of consecutive numbers in $p$-shifted random permutations"",

which the set of $l$ consecutive numbers $\{k, k+1,\cdots, k+l-1\}$ appears in
a set of consecutive positions. Under the uniformly probability measure $P_n$
on $S_n$, one has $P_n(A^{(n)}_{l;k})\sim\frac{l!}{n^{l-1}}$ as $n\to\infty$.
In one part of this paper we consider the probability of clustering of
consecutive numbers under Mallows distributions $P_n^q$, $q>0$. Because of a
duality, it suffices to consider $q\in(0,1)$. We show that for $q_n=1-\frac
c{n^\alpha}$, with $c>0$ and $\alpha\in(0,1)$, $P_n^q(A^{(n)}_{l;k_n})$ is on
the order $\frac1{n^{\alpha(l-1)}}$, uniformly over all sequences
$\{k_n\}_{n=1}^\infty$. Thus, letting
$N^{(n)}_l=\sum_{k=1}^{n-l+1}1_{A^{(n)}_{l;k}}$ denote the number of sets of
$l$ consecutive numbers appearing in sets of consecutive positions, we have
\begin{equation*} \lim_{n\to\infty} E_n^{q_n}N^{(n)}_l = \begin{cases}\infty,\
\text{if}\ l<\frac{1+\alpha}\alpha;\\ 0,\ \text{if} \ l>\frac{1+\alpha}\alpha.
\end{cases}. \end{equation*} We also consider the cases $\alpha=1$ and
$\alpha>1$. In the other part of the paper we consider general $p$-shifted
distributions, of which the Mallows distribution is a particular case. We
calculate explicitly the quantity $\lim_{l\to\infty}
\liminf_{n\to\infty}P_n^q(A^{(n)}_{l;k_n}) =
\lim_{l\to\infty}\limsup_{n\to\infty}P_n^q(A^{(n)}_{l;k_n})$ in terms of the
$p$-distribution. When this quantity is positive, we say that super-clustering
occurs. In particular, super-clustering occurs for the Mallows distribution
with parameter $q\neq1$. We also give a new characterization of $p$-shifted
distributions.

that the Riemann zeta function $\zeta(s)$ is not the solution of any algebraic
ordinary differential equations on its region of analyticity. In 2015, Van
Gorder considered the question of whether $\zeta(s)$ satisfies a non-algebraic
differential equation and showed that it formally satisfies an infinite order
linear differential equation. Recently, Prado and Klinger-Logan extended Van
Gorder's result to show that the Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s,a)$ is also
formally satisfies a similar differential equation
\begin{equation*}\label{HurDE}
  T\left[\zeta (s,a) - \frac{1}{a^s}\right] = \frac{1}{(s-1)a^{s-1}}.
\end{equation*} But unfortunately in the same paper they proved that the
operator $T$ applied to Hurwitz zeta function $\zeta(s,a)$ does not converge at
any point in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$.
  In this paper, by defining $T_{p}^{a}$, a $p$-adic analogue of Van Gorder's
operator $T,$ we establish an analogue of Prado and Klinger-Logan's
differential equation satisfied by $\zeta_{p,E}(s,a)$ which is the $p$-adic
analogue of the Hurwitz-type Euler zeta functions \begin{equation*}\label{HEZ}
\zeta_E(s,a)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{(-1)^n}{(n+a)^s}. \end{equation*} In
contrast with the complex case, due to the non-archimedean property, the
operator $T_{p}^{a}$ applied to the $p$-adic Hurwitz-type Euler zeta function
$\zeta_{p,E}(s,a)$ is convergent $p$-adically in the area of
$s\in\mathbb{Z}_{p}$ with $s\neq 1$ and $a\in K$ with $|a|_{p}>1,$ where $K$ is

anymore to the desirable extent.
  In this work, we investigate such potential longitudinal effects of
session-based recommendations in a simulation-based approach. Specifically, we
analyze to what extent algorithms of different types may lead to concentration
effects over time. Our experiments in the music domain reveal that all
investigated algorithms---both neural and heuristic ones---may lead to lower
item coverage and to a higher concentration on a subset of the items.
Additional simulation experiments however also indicate that relatively simple
re-ranking strategies, e.g., by avoiding too many repeated recommendations in
the music domain, may help to deal with this problem.

60848 over the last twenty five years. The spectra reveal recurrent, but
irregular cycles of increased circumstellar emission lines. These cycles are
highly asymmetric displaying a slow increase over about 6 years, followed by a
fast decay within about 6 months. Our analysis focuses on the most recent cycle
(2013 - 2020). The equivalent width and velocity separation of the emission
peaks indicate variations of the outer disk radius by a factor ~ 2.2, although
the variability appears more complex than expected from first principle
relations for optically thin Keplerian disks. We observe a time delay between
the variations of the strengths of He I 5876 on the one hand and H-alpha and
H-beta on the other hand. We interpret this behaviour in a two-step disk growth
scenario, where the disk first expands radially before its density increases. A
difference in behaviour is also seen between H-alpha and the H I Paschen lines,
with the latter displaying a more symmetric cycle, similar to the photometric
variability. The rather fast decays of the H-alpha emission observed in 2001,
2009 and 2018 - 2019 suggest that the strong radiation field and early spectral
type of the star lead to a faster dissipation of the disk than in later-type Be
stars, as theoretically expected. We discuss X-ray observations of the star
both during a high and a low-emission state. The X-ray spectrum is soft at both
epochs, and the X-ray fluxes are only marginally different and remain
consistent with the canonical Lx/Lbol relation of O-type stars. These results
indicate that the circumstellar decretion disk of HD 60848 has essentially no
impact on the star's X-ray emission, and that the latter most likely arises
inside the stellar wind.

extreme computational speed of trained neural networks and the unique transfer
knowledge property of bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN) to provide
a uniquely powerful and flexible computing platform. One of the most remarkable
properties of this framework consists in its ability to simulate the response
of complex systems, made of multiple interconnected components, by combining
individually pre-trained network models that do not require any further

the use of key concepts such as transfer knowledge and network concatenation.
Although the computational framework is illustrated and numerically validated

the weight distribution of linear codes achieving capacity on the BEC, which
were shown by the first author. In particular, we show that for any doubly
transitive binary linear code $C \subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ of rate $0 < R < 1$ with
weight distribution $\left(a_0,...,a_n\right)$ holds $a_i \le 2^{o(n)} \cdot
(1-R)^{-2 \ln 2 \cdot \min\{i, n-i\}}$.
  For doubly transitive codes with minimal distance at least
$\Omega\left(n^c\right)$, $0 < c \le 1$, the error factor of $2^{o(n)}$ in this
bound can be removed at the cost of replacing $1-R$ with a smaller constant $a
= a(R,c) < 1- R$. Moreover, in the special case of Reed-Muller codes, due to
the additional symmetries of these codes, this error factor can be removed at
essentially no cost.
  This implies that for any doubly transitive code $C$ of rate $R$ with minimal
distance at least $\Omega\left(n^c\right)$, there exists a positive constant $p
= p(R,c)$ such that $C$ decodes errors on $\mathrm{BSC}(p)$ with high
probability if $p < p(R,c)$. For doubly transitive codes of a sufficiently low
rate (smaller than some absolute constant) the requirement on the minimal
distance can be omitted, and hence this critical probability $p(R)$ depends
only on $R$. Furthermore, $p(R) \rightarrow \frac12$ as $R \rightarrow 0$.
  In particular, a Reed-Muller code $C$ of rate $R$ decodes errors on
$\mathrm{BSC}(p)$ with high probability if \[ R ~<~ 1 -

require large amounts of extensively annotated training data. In the case of

Therefore, in this paper, we present a method for self-supervised learning for
monocular depth estimation from aerial imagery that does not require annotated
training data. For this, we only use an image sequence from a single moving
camera and learn to simultaneously estimate depth and pose information. By
sharing the weights between pose and depth estimation, we achieve a relatively
small model, which favors real-time application. We evaluate our approach on
three diverse datasets and compare the results to conventional methods that
estimate depth maps based on multi-view geometry. We achieve an accuracy
{\delta}1.25 of up to 93.5 %. In addition, we have paid particular attention to
the generalization of a trained model to unknown data and the self-improving
capabilities of our approach. We conclude that, even though the results of
monocular depth estimation are inferior to those achieved by conventional

important topic world-wide due to the ageing infrastructure and increasing

found regular, successful practical application but sometimes suffer from
limited resolution and accuracy, imaging artefacts or restrictions in detecting
certain features. Until the 1980s X-ray transmission was used in case of
special demands and showed a resolution much higher than other NDT techniques.
However, due to safety concerns and cost issues, this method is almost never
used anymore. Muon tomography has received much attention recently. Novel
detectors for cosmic muons and tomographic imaging algorithms have opened up
new fields of application, such as the investigation of freight containers for
contraband or the assessment of the contents of radioactive waste containers.
But Muon imaging also has the potential to fill some of the gaps currently
existing in concrete NDT. As a first step towards practical use and as a proof
of concept we used an existing system to image the interior of a reference
reinforced 600 kg concrete block. Even with a yet not optimized setup for this
kind of investigation, the muon imaging results show more resolution and less
distortion compared to ultrasonic and radar imaging. The data acquisition takes
more time and signals contain more noise, but the images allowed to detect the

imaging for concrete inspection. The next steps include the development of

large-scale anisotropy of the transverse magnetic field profile on the shock
dynamics. We performed large two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations for a
wide range of upstream plasma magnetizations. A large-scale velocity shear and
current sheets form in the equatorial regions and at the poles, where they
drive strong plasma turbulence via Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices and kinks. The
mixing of current sheets in the downstream flow leads to efficient nonthermal
particle acceleration. The power-law spectrum hardens with increasing
magnetization, akin to those found in relativistic reconnection and kinetic
turbulence studies. The high end of the spectrum is composed of particles
surfing on the wake produced by elongated spearhead-shaped cavities forming at
the shock front and piercing through the upstream flow. These particles are
efficiently accelerated via the shear-flow acceleration mechanism near the Bohm
limit. Magnetized relativistic shocks are very efficient particle accelerators.
Capturing the global dynamics of the downstream flow is crucial to
understanding them, and therefore local plane parallel studies may not be
appropriate for pulsar wind nebulae and possibly other astrophysical
relativistic magnetized shocks. A natural outcome of such shocks is a variable

originating from the shock-front cavities, reminiscent of the mysterious Crab

physical infrastructure with admirable flexibility, while resource efficiency
and survivability are critical concerns for virtual network embedding (VNE). As
more and more internet applications migrate to the cloud, the resource
efficiency and the survivability of VNs, such as single link failure or
large-scale disaster survivability, have become crucial issues. Separating the
VNE problem into node and link mapping sub-problems without coordination might
cause a high embedding cost. This dissertation presents two independent
approaches to solve the aforementioned challenges. First, we study two-stage
coordinated survivable VNE (SVNE) problem and propose an adaptive path
splitting based SVNE (APSS) scheme. We first develop a concise anchor node
strategy to restrict the solution space of the candidate substrate nodes, which
coordinates node mapping with link mapping to limit the distance spans of the
virtual links. Then, we employ an adaptive path splitting policy to provide
full protection against single-link failures with partial backup resource, and
design an agile frequency slot windows choosing mechanism to mitigate the
spectrum fragmentation for link resource efficiency. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed APSS scheme can achieve satisfactory performance
in terms of spectrum utilization and blocking ratio. Second, we propose a
synchronous evacuation strategy for VNs with dual virtual machines (VMs) inside
a disaster risk zone (DRZ), which suffer higher risks than the VNs with single.
The evacuation strategy exploits post-copy technique to sustain the online
service alive and enhances synchronous VM migrations to shorten the dual-VM
evacuation time. Numerical results show that the proposed strategy can
outperform the best-effort scheme in terms of average and total evacuation
times of dual-VMs.

approach for quantifying temporal deviations in conformance checking based on
infusing the input process model with a temporal profile. The temporal profile
is calculated based on an associated process log considering task durations and

During runtime, deviations between an event stream and the process model with

plays a critical role in early prevention and diagnosis of cardiovascular
diseases. In the previous studies on automatic arrhythmia detection, most
methods concatenated 12 leads of ECG into a matrix, and then input the matrix
to a variety of feature extractors or deep neural networks for extracting
useful information. Under such frameworks, these methods had the ability to
extract comprehensive features (known as integrity) of 12-lead ECG since the
information of each lead interacts with each other during training. However,
the diverse lead-specific features (known as diversity) among 12 leads were
neglected, causing inadequate information learning for 12-lead ECG. To maximize
the information learning of multi-lead ECG, the information fusion of
comprehensive features with integrity and lead-specific features with diversity
should be taken into account. In this paper, we propose a novel
Multi-Lead-Branch Fusion Network (MLBF-Net) architecture for arrhythmia
classification by integrating multi-loss optimization to jointly learning
diversity and integrity of multi-lead ECG. MLBF-Net is composed of three
components: 1) multiple lead-specific branches for learning the diversity of
multi-lead ECG; 2) cross-lead features fusion by concatenating the output
feature maps of all branches for learning the integrity of multi-lead ECG; 3)
multi-loss co-optimization for all the individual branches and the concatenated
network. We demonstrate our MLBF-Net on China Physiological Signal Challenge
2018 which is an open 12-lead ECG dataset. The experimental results show that
MLBF-Net obtains an average $F_1$ score of 0.855, reaching the highest
arrhythmia classification performance. The proposed method provides a promising
solution for multi-lead ECG analysis from an information fusion perspective.

undergone significant changes in recent years. For active learning (AL)
purposes, NNs are, however, less commonly used -- despite their current
popularity. By using the superior text classification performance of NNs for
AL, we can either increase a model's performance using the same amount of data
or reduce the data and therefore the required annotation efforts while keeping
the same performance. We review AL for text classification using deep neural
networks (DNNs) and elaborate on two main causes which used to hinder the
adoption: (a) the inability of NNs to provide reliable uncertainty estimates,
on which the most commonly used query strategies rely, and (b) the challenge of
training DNNs on small data. To investigate the former, we construct a taxonomy
of query strategies, which distinguishes between data-based, model-based, and
prediction-based instance selection, and investigate the prevalence of these
classes in recent research. Moreover, we review recent NN-based advances in NLP
like word embeddings or language models in the context of (D)NNs, survey the
current state-of-the-art at the intersection of AL, text classification, and
DNNs and relate recent advances in NLP to AL. Finally, we analyze recent work
in AL for text classification, connect the respective query strategies to the
taxonomy, and outline commonalities and shortcomings. As a result, we highlight
gaps in current research and present open research questions.

Imitation Learning (ERIL) that minimizes the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL)

the framework of an entropy-regularized Markov decision process. An inverse RL
step computes the log-ratio between two distributions by evaluating two binary
discriminators. The first discriminator distinguishes the state generated by
the forward RL step from the expert's state. The second discriminator, which is
structured by the theory of entropy regularization, distinguishes the
state-action-next-state tuples generated by the learner from the expert ones.
One notable feature is that the second discriminator shares hyperparameters
with the forward RL, which can be used to control the discriminator's ability.
A forward RL step minimizes the reverse KL estimated by the inverse RL step. We
show that minimizing the reverse KL divergence is equivalent to finding an
optimal policy. Our experimental results on MuJoCo-simulated environments and
vision-based reaching tasks with a robotic arm show that ERIL is more

$\mathcal{H}^{(k)}$ are periodic in the outlets of the cylinder; the structure
of these periodic parts at different outlets can be different. We consider a

Under such assumption we show that the operator with several distant

which turn out to be exponentially small. We also conjecture that the made

This paper alleviates this issue by proposing a novel framework to replace the
classification task in one-stage detectors with a ranking task, and adopting
the Average-Precision loss (AP-loss) for the ranking problem. Due to its
non-differentiability and non-convexity, the AP-loss cannot be optimized
directly. For this purpose, we develop a novel optimization algorithm, which
seamlessly combines the error-driven update scheme in perceptron learning and
backpropagation algorithm in deep networks. We provide in-depth analyses on the
good convergence property and computational complexity of the proposed
algorithm, both theoretically and empirically. Experimental results demonstrate
notable improvement in addressing the imbalance issue in object detection over
existing AP-based optimization algorithms. An improved state-of-the-art
performance is achieved in one-stage detectors based on AP-loss over detectors
using classification-losses on various standard benchmarks. The proposed
framework is also highly versatile in accommodating different network

  tables",,,,"cs.CR cs.DC cs.LG stat.ML","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Federated learning is a distributed learning technique where machine learning
models are trained on client devices in which the local training data resides.
The training is coordinated via a central server which is, typically,
controlled by the intended owner of the resulting model. By avoiding the need
to transport the training data to the central server, federated learning
improves privacy and efficiency. But it raises the risk of model theft by
clients because the resulting model is available on every client device. Even
if the application software used for local training may attempt to prevent
direct access to the model, a malicious client may bypass any such restrictions
by reverse engineering the application software. Watermarking is a well-known
deterrence method against model theft by providing the means for model owners
to demonstrate ownership of their models. Several recent deep neural network
(DNN) watermarking techniques use backdooring: training the models with
additional mislabeled data. Backdooring requires full access to the training
data and control of the training process. This is feasible when a single party
trains the model in a centralized manner, but not in a federated learning
setting where the training process and training data are distributed among
several client devices. In this paper, we present WAFFLE, the first approach to
watermark DNN models trained using federated learning. It introduces a
retraining step at the server after each aggregation of local models into the
global model. We show that WAFFLE efficiently embeds a resilient watermark into
models incurring only negligible degradation in test accuracy (-0.17%), and
does not require access to training data. We also introduce a novel technique
to generate the backdoor used as a watermark. It outperforms prior techniques,
imposing no communication, and low computational (+3.2%) overhead.

particular, the technique incorporates a geometric deep learning model as a
blueprint for problem-specific models while integrating visualizations for

demanding context switches and ensure scalability, our matrix-based

semantic zoom, from an overview of model predictions down to the content. We
facilitate a focused analysis of relevant connections and groups based on
interactive user-steering for filtering and search tasks, a dynamically
modifiable partition hierarchy, various matrix reordering techniques, and
interactive model feedback. We evaluate our technique in a case study and

2017 was the most turbulent overall year for Trump. In 2020, story generation

agreement with theoretical models and show no evidence of inflated radii. This

structure determination. However, the 2D images which Cryo-EM detects are of
high noise and often mixed with multiple heterogeneous conformations or
contamination, imposing a challenge for denoising. Traditional image denoising
methods can not remove Cryo-EM image noise well when the signal-noise-ratio
(SNR) of images is meager. Thus it is desired to develop new effective
denoising techniques to facilitate further research such as 3D reconstruction,
2D conformation classification, and so on. In this paper, we approach the
robust image denoising problem in Cryo-EM by a joint Autoencoder and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN) method. Equipped with robust $\ell_1$ Autoencoder
and some designs of robust $\beta$-GANs, one can stabilize the training of GANs
and achieve the state-of-the-art performance of robust denoising with low SNR
data and against possible information contamination. The method is evaluated by
both a heterogeneous conformational dataset on the Thermus aquaticus RNA
Polymerase (RNAP) and a homogenous dataset on the Plasmodium falciparum 80S
ribosome dataset (EMPIRE-10028), in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE), Peak
Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), as
well as heterogeneous conformation clustering. These results suggest that our

kriging and its variants (such as regression kriging, in which auxiliary

doing so produce detailed maps of chosen target variables. At the same time, in

probabilities, we obtain uncertainty estimates via a Bayesian approximation
known as Monte Carlo dropout. In our example, we produce a national-scale
probabilistic geochemical map from point-sampled assay data, with auxiliary
information provided by a terrain elevation grid. Unlike traditional
geostatistical approaches, auxiliary variable grids are fed into our deep
neural network raw. There is no need to provide terrain derivatives (e.g. slope
angles, roughness, etc) because the deep neural network is capable of learning
these and arbitrarily more complex derivatives as necessary to maximise
predictive performance. We hope our results will raise awareness of the
suitability of Bayesian deep learning - and its feature learning capabilities -
for large-scale geostatistical applications where uncertainty matters.

Synchronous Multi-Channel Extension (DSME) to increase reliability, scalability
and energy-efficiency in industrial applications. The extension offers a
TDMA/FDMA-based channel access, where time is divided into two alternating
phases, a contention access period (CAP) and a contention free period (CFP).
During the CAP, transmission slots can be allocated offering an exclusive
access to the shared medium during the CFP. The fraction $\tau$ of CFP's time
slots in a dataframe is a critical value, because it directly influences
agility and throughput. A high throughput demands that the CFP is much longer
than the CAP, i.e., a high value of the fraction $\tau$, because application
data is only sent during the CFP. High agility is given if the expected waiting
time to send a CAP message is short and that the length of the CAPs are
sufficiently long to accommodate necessary (de)allocations of GTSs, i.e., a low
value of the fraction $\tau$. Once DSME is configured according to the needs of
an application, the fraction $\tau$ can only assume one of two values and
cannot be changed at run-time. In this paper, we propose two extensions of DSME
that allow to adopt $\tau$ to the current traffic pattern. We show
theoretically and through simulations that the proposed extensions provide a
high degree of responsiveness to traffic fluctuations while keeping the
throughput high.

cover all the triangles in a graph is at most twice the maximum number of
edge-disjoint triangles. This conjecture was couched in a broader setting by
Aharoni and Zerbib who proposed a hypergraph version of this conjecture, and
also studied its implied fractional versions. We establish the fractional
version of the Aharoni-Zerbib conjecture up to lower order terms. Specifically,
we give a factor $t/2+ O(\sqrt{t \log t})$ approximation based on LP rounding
for an algorithmic version of the hypergraph Tur\'{a}n problem (AHTP). The
objective in AHTP is to pick the smallest collection of $(t-1)$-sized subsets
of vertices of an input $t$-uniform hypergraph such that every hyperedge
contains one of these subsets.
  Aharoni and Zerbib also posed whether Tuza's conjecture and its hypergraph
versions could follow from non-trivial duality gaps between vertex covers and
matchings on hypergraphs that exclude certain sub-hypergraphs, for instance, a
""tent"" structure that cannot occur in the incidence of triangles and edges. We
give a strong negative answer to this question, by exhibiting tent-free
hypergraphs, and indeed $\mathcal{F}$-free hypergraphs for any finite family
$\mathcal{F}$ of excluded sub-hypergraphs, whose vertex covers must include
almost all the vertices.
  The algorithmic questions arising in the above study can be phrased as
instances of vertex cover on simple hypergraphs, whose hyperedges can pairwise
share at most one vertex. We prove that the trivial factor $t$ approximation
for vertex cover is hard to improve for simple $t$-uniform hypergraphs.
However, for set cover on simple $n$-vertex hypergraphs, the greedy algorithm
achieves a factor $(\ln n)/2$, better than the optimal $\ln n$ factor for
general hypergraphs.

this paper proposes a new notion of eluder dimension for the policy space,
which characterizes the intrinsic complexity of policy learning in an arbitrary

In the early 1970's, Erd\H{o}s
and O'Neil considered a generalization of Ramsey numbers. Given integers
$n,k,s$ and $t$ with $n \ge k \ge s,t \ge 2$, they asked for the least integer
$N=f_k(n,s,t)$ such that in any red-blue coloring of the $k$-subsets of $\{1,
2,\ldots, N\}$, there is a set of size $n$ such that either each of its
$s$-subsets is contained in some red $k$-subset, or each of its $t$-subsets is
contained in some blue $k$-subset. Erd\H{o}s and O'Neil found an exact formula
for $f_k(n,s,t)$ when $k\ge s+t-1$. In the arguably more interesting case where
$k=s+t-2$, they showed $2^{-\binom{k}{2}}n<\log f_k(n,s,t)<2n$ for sufficiently
large $n$. Our main result closes the gap between these lower and upper bounds,
determining the logarithm of $f_{s+t-2}(n,s,t)$ up to a multiplicative factor.
  Recently, Dam\'asdi, Keszegh, Malec, Tompkins, Wang and Zamora initiated the
investigation of saturation problems in Ramsey theory, wherein one seeks to
minimize $n$ such that there exists an $r$-edge-coloring of $K_n$ for which any
extension of this to an $r$-edge-coloring of $K_{n+1}$ would create a new
monochromatic copy of $K_k$. We obtain essentially sharp bounds for this
problem.

an agent has to learn an optimal action balancing exploration and exploitation.
Properly managing this trade-off requires a correct assessment of uncertainty;
in multi-armed bandits, as in other machine learning applications, it is
important to distinguish between stochasticity that is inherent to the system
(aleatoric uncertainty) and stochasticity that derives from the limited
knowledge of the agent (epistemic uncertainty). In this paper we consider the
formalism of subjective logic, a concise and expressive framework to express
Dirichlet-multinomial models as subjective opinions, and we apply it to the
problem of multi-armed bandits. We propose new algorithms grounded in
subjective logic to tackle the multi-armed bandit problem, we compare them
against classical algorithms from the literature, and we analyze the insights
they provide in evaluating the dynamics of uncertainty. Our preliminary results
suggest that subjective logic quantities enable useful assessment of
uncertainty that may be exploited by more refined agents.

debris disc mass. We estimate the total mass of the discs by extrapolating up
the mass of emitting dust with the help of collisional cascade models. The
resulting mass of bright debris discs appears to be unrealistically large,
exceeding the mass of solids available in the systems at the preceding

While we cannot rule out the possibility that a combination of these might
help, we argue that the easiest solution would be to assume that planetesimals

kilometre range, especially at large distances from the stars. This conclusion
would necessitate revisions to the existing planetesimal formation models, and

  Articulation In Soft Robotic Arms",,,,,"physics.app-ph cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This study examines a biology-inspired approach of using reconfigurable
articulation to reduce the control requirement for soft robotic arms. We
construct a robotic arm by assembling Kresling origami modules that exhibit
predictable bistability. Via switching between their two stable states, these
origami modules can behave either like a flexible joint with low bending
stiffness or like a stiff link with high stiffness, without requiring any
continuous power supply. In this way, the robotic arm can exhibit
pseudo-linkage kinematics with lower control requirements and improved motion
accuracy. A unique advantage of using origami as the robotic arm skeleton is
that its bending stiffness ratio between stable states is directly related to
the underlying Kresling design. Therefore, we conduct extensive parametric
analyses and experimental validations to identify the optimized Kresling
pattern for articulation. The results indicate that a higher angle ratio, a
smaller resting length at contracted stable state, and a large number of
polygon sides can offer more significant and robust bending stiffness tuning.
Based on this insight, we construct a proof-of-concept, tendon-driven robotic
arm consisting of three modules, and show that it can exhibit the desired
reconfigurable articulation behavior. Moreover, the deformations of this
manipulator are consistent with kinematic model predictions, which validate the
possibility of using simple controllers for such compliant robotic systems.

forsterite droplets subjected to sub-atmospheric conditions. Melt droplets,
1.5-2.5 mm in diameter, are made to crystallize under levitated conditions. The
spherule is initially superheated by about 250oC above its liquids temperature,
for both atmospheric and sub-atmospheric conditions, and then, subsequently
cooled at different cooling rates. Crystallization of molten droplets was
observed from their hypercooled states in all the cases. It was found that the
level of undercooling was more (~150K-200K) for sub-atmospheric cases. In
addition, the degree of recalescence was also found to be higher. However, the
varying cooling rates did not produce any considerable effect on the level of
undercooling or, even, the degree of recalescence. For better insight into the
dynamics of crystallization, in situ visualization of the recalescence process
was made possible by use of high-speed camera. A clear difference in the growth
mechanisms was observed. The role of cooling rate in affecting crystallization
was seen as the difference in the growth of the crystal-front; from a clear rim
front, in high cooling rates, to a faded irregularly shaped crystal front, in
low cooling rates. Two proper crystal fronts were observed in all the cases,
which correspond to surface and volumetric crystallizations. It was observed
that the molten droplets, under sub-atmospheric conditions, undergo high rate
of volumetric crystallization, which is marked by the sightings of surface
textures during the recalescence process. High-speed camera images of
recalescence provided direct observational proof of the delay in volumetric
crystallization, compared to surface crystallization.

are a central topic of study in parameterized complexity. A main aim of
research in this area is to understand the ""price of generality"" of these
widths: as we transition from more restrictive to more general notions, which
are the problems that see their complexity status deteriorate from
fixed-parameter tractable to intractable? This type of question is by now very
well-studied, but, somewhat strikingly, the algorithmic frontier between the
two (arguably) most central width notions, treewidth and pathwidth, is still
not understood: currently, no natural graph problem is known to be W-hard for
one but FPT for the other. Indeed, a surprising development of the last few
years has been the observation that for many of the most paradigmatic problems,
their complexities for the two parameters actually coincide exactly, despite
the fact that treewidth is a much more general parameter. It would thus appear
that the extra generality of treewidth over pathwidth often comes ""for free"".
  Our main contribution in this paper is to uncover the first natural example
where this generality comes with a high price. We consider Grundy Coloring, a
variation of coloring where one seeks to calculate the worst possible coloring
that could be assigned to a graph by a greedy First-Fit algorithm. We show that
this well-studied problem is FPT parameterized by pathwidth; however, it
becomes significantly harder (W[1]-hard) when parameterized by treewidth.
Furthermore, we show that Grundy Coloring makes a second complexity jump for
more general widths, as it becomes para-NP-hard for clique-width. Hence, Grundy
Coloring nicely captures the complexity trade-offs between the three most
well-studied parameters. Completing the picture, we show that Grundy Coloring
is FPT parameterized by modular-width.

challenged by two main factors: the rich geometric structure encoding the
physical and stability properties of the dynamics and its local low-rank
nature. To address these aspects, we propose a nonlinear structure-preserving
model reduction where the reduced phase space evolves in time. In the spirit of
dynamical low-rank approximation, the reduced dynamics is obtained by a
symplectic projection of the Hamiltonian vector field onto the tangent space of
the approximation manifold at each reduced state. A priori error estimates are
established in terms of the projection error of the full model solution onto
the reduced manifold. For the temporal discretization of the reduced dynamics
we employ splitting techniques. The reduced basis satisfies an evolution
equation on the manifold of symplectic and orthogonal rectangular matrices
having one dimension equal to the size of the full model. We recast the problem
on the tangent space of the matrix manifold and develop intrinsic temporal
integrators based on Lie group techniques together with explicit Runge-Kutta

Specifically, we describe a stochastic first-order gradient method, called

tracking (GT) to address the stochastic and decentralized nature of the
problem. We show that GT-SARAH, with appropriate algorithmic parameters, finds
an $\epsilon$-accurate first-order stationary point with
$O\big(\max\big\{N^{\frac{1}{2}},n(1-\lambda)^{-2},n^{\frac{2}{3}}m^{\frac{1}{3}}(1-\lambda)^{-1}\big\}L\epsilon^{-2}\big)$
gradient complexity, where ${(1-\lambda)\in(0,1]}$ is the spectral gap of the
network weight matrix and $L$ is the smoothness parameter of the cost
functions. This gradient complexity outperforms that of the existing
decentralized stochastic gradient methods. In particular, in a big-data regime
such that ${n = O(N^{\frac{1}{2}}(1-\lambda)^{3})}$, this gradient complexity
furthers reduces to ${O(N^{\frac{1}{2}}L\epsilon^{-2})}$, independent of the
network topology, and matches that of the centralized near-optimal
variance-reduced methods. Moreover, in this regime GT-SARAH achieves a
non-asymptotic linear speedup, in that, the total number of gradient
computations at each node is reduced by a factor of $1/n$ compared to the
centralized near-optimal algorithms that perform all gradient computations at a
single node. To the best of our knowledge, GT-SARAH is the first algorithm that
achieves this property. In addition, we show that appropriate choices of local
minibatch size balance the trade-offs between the gradient and communication
complexity of GT-SARAH. Over infinite time horizon, we establish that all nodes
in GT-SARAH asymptotically achieve consensus and converge to a first-order
stationary point in the almost sure and mean-squared sense.

unsupervised methods and \textit{end-to-end} techniques such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN) using Mel-Scaled Log-magnitude Spectograms features
(MLS), Self-Similarity Matrices (SSM) or Self-Similarity Lag Matrices (SSLM) as
inputs and trained with human annotations. Several studies have been published
divided into unsupervised and \textit{end-to-end} methods in which
pre-processing is done in different ways, using different distance metrics and
audio characteristics, so a generalized pre-processing method to compute model
inputs is missing. The objective of this work is to establish a general method
of pre-processing these inputs by comparing the inputs calculated from
different pooling strategies, distance metrics and audio characteristics, also
taking into account the computing time to obtain them. We also establish the
most effective combination of inputs to be delivered to the CNN in order to
establish the most efficient way to extract the limits of the structure of the
music pieces. With an adequate combination of input matrices and pooling
strategies we obtain a measurement accuracy $F_1$ of 0.411 that outperforms the
current one obtained under the same conditions.

collects subshells with the same degeneracy and leads to the definition of a

authors have personal experience in the WA context, wider observations across
Australia and selected international benchmarks are also included. Key lessons
include the importance of good health advice in Australia's interest; timely,
synchronized and aligned action at all levels of government; a program of well
communicated, aligned health and economic measures which support all in society
allowing a very high level of appropriate community behaviour, ensuring the
health system was not overloaded; innovation in telehealth, testing, pandemic

continue; and strong border and travel controls with highly effective isolation
preventing community spread, ultimately enabling rapid elimination of the
disease from the hospital system. In combination, these demonstrate that in the
case of Western Australia the result of first eliminating the disease from the

enabled a world leading outcome in both in health and economic terms. The

development, it will take time to vaccinate the entire population, and plasma
therapy has some limitations. Herd immunity can be a plausible option to fight
COVID-19 for small countries. But for a country with huge population like
India, herd immunity is not a plausible option, because to acquire herd
immunity approximately 67% of the population has to be recovered from COVID-19
infection, which will put an extra burden on medical system of the country and
will result in a huge loss of human life. Thus epidemiological interventions
(complete lockdown, partial lockdown, quarantine, isolation, social distancing,

until the vaccine development. In this work, we have suggested the SIR model

quantity which covers all type of intervention. We have also discussed the

variable and fractional order operators enables a unique and extremely powerful
approach to model nucleation and propagation of cracks in solids under dynamic
loading. The resulting dynamic fracture formulation is fully evolutionary hence
enabling the analysis of complex crack patterns without requiring any a prior
assumptions on the damage location and the growth path, as well as the use of
any algorithm to track the evolving crack surface. The evolutionary nature of
the variable-order formalism also prevents the need for additional partial
differential equations to predict the damage field, hence suggesting a
conspicuous reduction in the computational cost. Remarkably, the variable order
formulation is naturally capable of capturing extremely detailed features
characteristic of dynamic crack propagation such as crack surface roughening,
single and multiple branching. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed
variable-order formulation is validated by comparing the results of direct
numerical simulations with experimental data of typical benchmark problems
