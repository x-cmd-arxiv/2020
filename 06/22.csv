instabilities which result in a decay process of the initial wave into
different daughter waves depending upon the amplitude of the fluctuations and
the plasma beta. The propagation angle with respect to the mean magnetic field
of the daughter waves plays an important role in determining the type of decay.
In this paper, we revisit this problem by means of multi-dimensional hybrid
simulations. In particular, we study the decay and the subsequent nonlinear
evolution of large-amplitude Alfv\'en waves by investigating the saturation
mechanism of the instability and its final nonlinear state reached for
different wave amplitudes and plasma beta conditions. As opposed to
one-dimensional simulations where the Decay instability is suppressed for
increasing plasma beta values, we find that the decay process in
multi-dimensions persists at large values of the plasma beta via the
filamentation/magnetosonic decay instabilities. In general, the decay process
acts as a trigger both to develop a perpendicular turbulent cascade and to
enhance mean field-aligned wave-particle interactions. We find indeed that the
saturated state is characterized by a turbulent plasma displaying a
field-aligned beam at the Alfv\'en speed and increased temperatures that we
ascribe to the Landau resonance and pitch angle scattering in phase space.

single-pixel or low-resolution devices in the past, recently, large (up to 1

technique that leverages SPCs as passive imaging devices for photography in
challenging conditions, including ultra low-light and fast motion. Inspired by
recent success of conventional burst photography, we design algorithms that
align and merge binary sequences captured by SPCs into intensity images with
minimal motion blur and artifacts, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and high
dynamic range. We theoretically analyze the SNR and dynamic range of quanta
burst photography, and identify the imaging regimes where it provides
significant benefits. We demonstrate, via a recently developed SPAD array, that
the proposed method is able to generate high-quality images for scenes with
challenging lighting, complex geometries, high dynamic range and moving

irreducible polynomial S-boxes. First, we propose 16 different S-boxes based on
projective general linear group and 16 primitive irreducible polynomials of
Galois field of order 256, and then utilize these S-boxes with combination of
chaotic map in image encryption scheme. Three chaotic sequences can be produced
by the Lorenz chaotic system corresponding to variables $x$, $y$ and $z$. We
construct a new pseudo random chaotic sequence $k_i$ based on $x$, $y$ and $z$.
The plain image is encrypted by the use of chaotic sequence $k_i$ and XOR
operation to get a ciphered image. To demonstrate the strength of presented
image encryption, some renowned analyses as well as MATLAB simulations are

oscillators (PCOs) over directed graphs. It is known that when the digraphs are
strongly connected, global synchronization can be achieved by using a class of
deterministic set-valued reset controllers. However, for large-scale networks,
these algorithms are not scalable because some of their tuning parameters have
upper bounds of the order of O(1/N), where N is the number of agents. This
paper resolves this scalability issue by presenting several new results in the
context of global synchronization of PCOs with more general network topologies
using deterministic and stochastic hybrid dynamical systems. First, we
establish that similar deterministic resetting algorithms can achieve robust,
global, and fixed-time synchronization in any rooted acyclic digraph. Moreover,
in this case we show that the synchronization dynamics are now scalable as the
tuning parameters of the algorithm are network independent, i.e., of order
O(1). However, the algorithms cannot be further extended to all rooted
digraphs. We establish this new impossibility result by introducing a
counterexample with a particular rooted digraph for which global
synchronization cannot be achieved, irrespective of the tuning of the reset
rule. Nevertheless, we show that if the resetting algorithms are modified by
accommodating an Erdos-Renyi type random graph model, then the resulting
stochastic resetting dynamics will guarantee global synchronization almost
surely for all rooted digraphs and, moreover, the tunable parameters of the
dynamics are network independent. Stability and robustness properties of the
resetting algorithms are studied using the tools from set-valued hybrid
dynamical systems. Numerical simulations are provided at the end of the paper

maps each mode of this distribution to the respective class labels, i.e., real

them. In order to transfer this model to a new domain, we associate a few
target samples with one of the previously trained modes. In addition, we
propose a spatial mixup augmentation strategy that further helps generalization
across domains. We find this learning strategy to be surprisingly effective at
domain transfer compared to a traditional classification or even
state-of-the-art domain adaptation/few-shot learning methods. For instance,

  Electors affect District-based Elections?","16 pages",,,,"stat.AP cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many democratic countries use district-based elections where there is a
""seat"" for each district in the governing body. In each district, the party
whose candidate gets the maximum number of votes wins the corresponding seat.
The result of the election is decided based on the number of seats won by the
different parties. The electors (voters) can cast their votes only in the
district of their residence. Thus, locations of the electors and boundaries of
the districts may severely affect the election result even if the proportion of
popular support (number of electors) of different parties remains unchanged.
This has led to significant amount of research on whether the districts may be
redrawn or electors may be moved to maximize seats for a particular party. In
this paper, we frame the spatial distribution of electors in a probabilistic
setting, and explore different models to capture the intra-district
polarization of electors in favour of a party, or the spatial concentration of
supporters of different parties. Our models are inspired by elections in India,
where supporters of different parties tend to be concentrated in certain
districts. We show with extensive simulations that our model can capture
different statistical properties of real elections held in India. We frame
parameter estimation problems to fit our models to the observed election
results. Since analytical calculation of the likelihood functions are
infeasible for our complex models, we use Likelihood-free Inference methods
under the Approximate Bayesian Computation framework. Since this approach is
highly time-consuming, we explore how supervised regression using Logistic
Regression or Deep Neural Networks can be used to speed it up. We also explore
how the election results can change by varying the spatial distributions of the
voters, even when the proportions of popular support of the parties remain
constant.

using the samples generated by the model to capture the phase transition via
evaluation of observables, we show how the model itself can be employed as an
unsupervised indicator of transitions, by constructing measures of the model's

in a wide orbit around an inner binary system of a black hole (BH) and a B III
type star. We argue that this system is unlikely to be a hierarchical triple
due to three reasons: (i) Given that this system is discovered in a magnitude
limited Bright Star Catalog, the expected number of such systems in the Milky
Way amounts to about $10^4$ while the estimate for the MW budget for such
systems is between $10^2-10^3$ systems under generous assumptions. Such a large
gap cannot be reconciled as it would otherwise likely overflow the MW budget
for BHs; (ii) The dynamical stability of this system sets lower bounds on the
orbital separation of the outer Be star, while it not being resolved by Gaia
places an upper limit on its projected sky separation. We show that these two
constraints would imply a narrow range for the outer orbit without resorting to
geometrical fine-tuning; (iii) The triple system should have survived the
stellar evolution prior to the formation of the BH in the inner binary. We
perform numerical simulations starting with conservative initial conditions of
this system and show that a small parameter space for BH progenitor star's mass
loss, BH natal kicks, and initial orbital separation can reproduce HR 6819.
Therefore, we propose this system is a chance superposition of a Be star with a
binary.

whether it has the potential to reduce wind plant wake losses. Through
application of rotor yaw to multirotor turbines, a new degree of freedom is
introduced to wind farm control such that wakes can be expanded, channelled, or
redirected to improve inflow conditions for downstream turbines. Five different
yaw configurations are investigated (including a baseline case) by employing
large-eddy simulations (LES) to generate a detailed representation of the
velocity field downwind of a multirotor wind turbine. Two lower-fidelity models
from single-rotor yaw studies (curled-wake model and analytical Gaussian wake
model) are extended to the multirotor case and their results are compared with
the LES data. For each model, the wake is analysed primarily by examining wake
cross sections at different downwind distances. Further quantitative analysis
is carried out through characterisations of wake centroids and widths over a
range of streamwise locations, and through a brief analysis of power
production. Most significantly, it is shown that rotor yaw can have a
considerable impact on both the distribution and magnitude of the wake velocity
deficit, leading to power gains for downstream turbines. The lower-fidelity
models show small deviation from the LES results for specific configurations;
however, both are able to reasonably capture the wake trends over a large

commonly regarded as prototypical defects for solid-state quantum information
processing. Here we show that when silicon and nitrogen are simultaneously
introduced into the diamond lattice these defects can strongly interact and
form larger complexes. Nitrogen atoms strongly bind to Si and SiV centers and
complex formation can occur. Using a combination of hybrid density functional
theory (DFT) and group theory, we analyze the electronic structure and provide
various useful physical properties, such as hyperfine structure, quasi-local
vibrational modes, and zero-phonon line, to enable experimental identification
of these complexes. We demonstrate that the presence of substitutional silicon
adjacent to nitrogen significantly shifts the donor level toward the conduction
band, resulting in an activation energy for the SiN center that is comparable
to phosphorus. We also find that the neutral SiNV center is of particular
interest due to its photon emission at $\sim$1530 nm, which falls within the C
band of telecom wavelengths, and its paramagnetic nature. In addition, the
optical transition associated with the SiNV$^0$ color center exhibits very
small electron--phonon coupling (Huang--Rhys factor~=~0.78) resulting in high
quantum efficiency (Debye-Waller factor = 46\%) for single-photon emission.
These features render this new center very attractive for potential application
in scalable quantum telecommunication networks.

response of metal nanoparticles report a wide variation of nonlinear
coefficients, thus, revealing a highly confused picture of the underlying
physics. This naturally prevents rational design of these systems for practical
devices. Here, we provide a systematic study of the nonlinear response of metal
spheres under continuous wave illumination within a purely thermal model. We
characterize the strong dependence of the temperature rise and overall
thermo-optic nonlinear response on the particle size and permittivity, on the
optical and thermal host properties, as well as on the thermo-derivatives of
these properties. This dependence on the non-intrinsic parameters explains why
it is inappropriate to extract an intrinsic nonlinear coefficient from a
specific system. Despite the revealed complex multi-parameter dependence, we
managed to uncover a rather simple behaviour of the nonlinear response. In
particular, we show that the nonlinearity coefficients exhibit a dependence on
the illumination intensity which mimics the dependence of the temperature
itself on the illumination intensity, namely, it grows for small nanoparticle
sizes, reaches a maximum and then decreases monotonically for larger
nanoparticles. The improved modelling allows us to demonstrate an overall
nonlinear response which is about a 1000 times higher than in other strongly
nonlinear systems (e.g., $\epsilon$-near-zero systems); it also provides an
excellent match to experimental measurements of the scattering from a single
metal nanoparticles, thus, confirming the dominance of the thermal nonlinear

efficiently solve steady state solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi equations and
hyperbolic conservation laws. Similar as other fast sweeping schemes, the key
components of this class of methods are the Gauss-Seidel iterations and
alternating sweeping strategy to achieve fast convergence rate. Furthermore,
good properties of fixed-point iterative sweeping methods include that they
have explicit forms and do not involve inverse operation of nonlinear local
systems, and they can be applied to general hyperbolic equations using any
monotone numerical fluxes and high order approximations easily. In [L. Wu,
Y.-T. Zhang, S. Zhang and C.-W. Shu, Commun. Comput. Phys., 20 (2016)], a fifth
order fixed-point sweeping WENO scheme was designed and it was shown that the
scheme converges much faster than the total variation diminishing (TVD)
Runge-Kutta approach by stability improvement of high order schemes with a
forward Euler time-marching. An open problem is that for some benchmark
numerical examples, the iteration residue of the fixed-point sweeping WENO
scheme hangs at a truncation error level instead of settling down to machine
zero. This issue makes it difficult to determine the convergence criterion for
the iteration and challenging to apply the method to complex problems. To solve
this issue, in this paper we apply the multi-resolution WENO scheme developed
in [J. Zhu and C.-W. Shu, J. Comput. Phys., 375 (2018)] to the fifth order
fixed-point sweeping WENO scheme and obtain an absolutely convergent
fixed-point fast sweeping method for steady state of hyperbolic conservation
laws, i.e., the residue of the fast sweeping iterations converges to machine
zero / round off errors for all benchmark problems tested.

vulnerability to backdoor attacks -- a trojan model responds to

data (e.g., images), the vulnerability of graph neural networks (GNNs) for
discrete-structured data (e.g., graphs) is largely unexplored, which is highly
concerning given their increasing use in security-sensitive domains. To bridge
this gap, we present GTA, the first backdoor attack on GNNs. Compared with
prior work, GTA departs in significant ways: graph-oriented -- it defines
triggers as specific subgraphs, including both topological structures and
descriptive features, entailing a large design spectrum for the adversary;
input-tailored -- it dynamically adapts triggers to individual graphs, thereby
optimizing both attack effectiveness and evasiveness; downstream model-agnostic
-- it can be readily launched without knowledge regarding downstream models or
fine-tuning strategies; and attack-extensible -- it can be instantiated for
both transductive (e.g., node classification) and inductive (e.g., graph
classification) tasks, constituting severe threats for a range of
security-critical applications. Through extensive evaluation using benchmark
datasets and state-of-the-art models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of GTA.

We test the approach by solving the 2D acoustic wave equation for
spatially-varying velocity models of increasing complexity, including
homogeneous, layered and Earth-realistic models, and find the network is able
to accurately simulate the wavefield across these cases. By using the physics
constraint in the loss function the network is able to solve for the wavefield
far outside of its boundary training data, offering a way to reduce the
generalisation issues of existing deep learning approaches. We extend the
approach for the Earth-realistic case by conditioning the network on the source

removing the need to retrain the network for each solution. In contrast to
traditional numerical simulation this approach is very efficient when computing

atoms sandwiched between two square nets of Se atoms, forming the
Se-Ta-Ta-Ta-Ta-Se networks. A combined result of magnetic susceptibility,
resistivity, and heat capacity measurements on Ta2Se indicate the bulk
superconductivity with Tc = 3.8 (1) K. According to the first-principal

flat bands at gamma-point in the Brillouin zone (BZ) yield to the van Hove

intensified by introducing spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, thus, could be
critical for the superconductivity in Ta2Se. The physical properties especially
superconductivity is completely different from Ta-rich alloys or transition
metal dichalcogenide TaSe2.

measurements on MnPt5As confirm ferromagnetism in this phase with a Curie
temperature of ~301 K and a saturated moment of 3.5 uB per formula. Evaluation
by applying the Stoner Criterion also indicates that MnPt5As is susceptible to
ferromagnetism. Electronic structure calculations using the WIEN2k program with
local spin density approximation imply that the spontaneous magnetization of
this phase arises primarily from the hybridization of d orbitals on both Mn and
Pt atoms. The theoretical assessments are consistent with the experimental
results. Moreover, the spin-orbit coupling effects heavily influence on
magnetic moments in MnPt5As. MnPt5As is the first high-performance magnetic

PE-regular subsets of $\text{BS}(1, q)$: these are the subsets of

can be written as the free convolution of the initial condition and the

initial condition obtained by performing the free deconvolution via the
subordination functions method. This statistical estimator is original as it
involves the resolution of a fixed point equation, and a classical
deconvolution by a Cauchy distribution. This is due to the fact that, in free

to the Cauchy transform. In past literature, there has been a focus on the
estimation of the initial conditions of linear PDEs such as the heat equation,

tackled for a non-linear PDE. The convergence of the estimator is proved and
the integrated mean square error is computed, providing rates of convergence
similar to the ones known for non-parametric deconvolution methods. Finally, a

of attacks is critical in sensitive applications of federated learning, where
data is scarce and the model has high commercial value. We introduce here the
first theoretical and experimental analysis of free-rider attacks on federated
learning schemes based on iterative parameters aggregation, such as FedAvg or
FedProx, and provide formal guarantees for these attacks to converge to the
aggregated models of the fair participants. We first show that a
straightforward implementation of this attack can be simply achieved by not

this attack can be detected by adopting simple countermeasures at the server

stochastic updates of the free-rider parameters. We demonstrate the proposed
strategies on a number of experimental scenarios, in both iid and non-iid

Modelling the baffle as a spatial distribution of linear drag
$\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)=-\chi(\mathbf{x})\mathbf{u}_{tot}(\mathbf{x},t)$
within the flow ($\mathbf{u}_{tot}$ is the total velocity field and $\chi \ge
0$ a scalar field), two different optimisation problems are considered to
design $\chi$ at a Reynolds number $Re=3000$. In the first, the smallest baffle
defined in terms of a $L_1 $ norm of $\chi$ is sought which minimises the
viscous dissipation rate of the flow. In the second, a baffle which minimises
the total energy consumption of the flow is treated. Both problems indicate
that the baffle should be axisymmetric and radially localised near the pipe
wall, but struggle to predict the optimal streamwise extent. A manual search
finds an optimal baffle one radius long which is then used to study how the
amplitude for relaminarisation varies with $Re$ up to $15\,000$. Large stress
reduction is found at the pipe wall, but at the expense of an increased
pressure drop across the baffle. Estimates are then made of the break even
point downstream of the baffle where the stress reduction at the wall due to
the relaminarised flow compensates for the extra drag produced by the baffle.

critical insights into the infection's transmission course and allow efficient
resource allocation. Existing methods use graph-theoretic centrality measures
and expensive message-passing algorithms, requiring knowledge of the underlying
dynamics and its parameters. In this paper, we revisit this problem using graph
neural networks (GNNs) to learn P0. We establish a theoretical limit for the
identification of P0 in a class of epidemic models. We evaluate our method
against different epidemic models on both synthetic and a real-world contact
network considering a disease with history and characteristics of COVID-19. %
We observe that GNNs can identify P0 close to the theoretical bound on
accuracy, without explicit input of dynamics or its parameters. In addition,
GNN is over 100 times faster than classic methods for inference on arbitrary
graph topologies. Our theoretical bound also shows that the epidemic is like a
ticking clock, emphasizing the importance of early contact-tracing. We find a
maximum time after which accurate recovery of the source becomes impossible,
regardless of the algorithm used.

proposed in the literature, the question of how to aggregate the predictions of

this paper, we introduce a formal framework of ensemble multilabel
classification, in which we distinguish two principal approaches: ""predict then
combine"" (PTC), where the ensemble members first make loss minimizing
predictions which are subsequently combined, and ""combine then predict"" (CTP),
which first aggregates information such as marginal label probabilities from
the individual ensemble members, and then derives a prediction from this
aggregation. While both approaches generalize voting techniques commonly used
for multilabel ensembles, they allow to explicitly take the target performance
measure into account. Therefore, concrete instantiations of CTP and PTC can be
tailored to concrete loss functions. Experimentally, we show that standard
voting techniques are indeed outperformed by suitable instantiations of CTP and
PTC, and provide some evidence that CTP performs well for decomposable loss
functions, whereas PTC is the better choice for non-decomposable losses.

experiments carried out on individual semiconductor nanowires in their as grown

microfocus station of the P08 beamline at the 3rd generation source PETRA III.
Using an incident X-ray beam energy of 9 keV and photon flux of
10$^{10}$s$^{-1}$, the axial lattice parameter and tilt of individual
GaAs/In$_{0.2}$Ga$_{0.8}$As/GaAs core-shell nanowires were monitored by
continuously recording reciprocal space maps of the 111 Bragg reflection at a
fixed spatial position over several hours. In addition, the emission properties
of the (In,Ga)As quantum well, the atomic composition of the exposed nanowires
and the nanowire morphology are studied by cathodoluminescence spectroscopy,
energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy,
respectively, both prior to and after nXRD exposure. Nanowires exposed under
ambient conditions show severe optical and morphological damage, which was
reduced for nanowires exposed under He atmosphere. The observed damage can be
largely attributed to an oxidation process from X-ray induced ozone reactions
in air. Due to the lower heat transfer coefficient compared to GaAs, this oxide
shell limits the heat transfer through the nanowire side facets, which is
considered as the main channel of heat dissipation for nanowires in the
as-grown geometry.

lack of studies that provide complete understanding of the underlying
fundamental processes governing the transverse momentum distribution of
photoelectrons emitted from single crystals. For example, initial predictions
based on density-functional theory calculations of effective electron masses
suggested that the (111) surface of PbTe would produce very small MTEs ($\leq$
15 meV), whereas our experiments yielded MTEs ten to twenty times larger than
these predictions, and also exhibited a lower photoemission threshold than
predicted. The ab initio framework presented in this manuscript correctly
reproduces the magnitude of the MTEs from our measurements in PbTe(111) and
also the observed photoemission below the predicted threshold. Our results show
that photoexcitations into bulk-like states and coherent, many-body
electron-photon-phonon scattering processes, both of which initial predictions
ignored, indeed play important roles in photoemission from PbTe(111). Finally,
from the lessons learned, we recommend a procedure for rapid computational
screening of potential single-crystal photocathodes for applications in
next-generation ultrafast electron diffraction and X-ray free-electron lasers,
which will enable new, significant advances in condensed matter research.

increasingly important topic. The security community has demonstrated that
without transparency of the data and the resulting model, there exist many
potential security risks, with new risks constantly being discovered.
  In this paper, we focus on one of these security risks -- poisoning attacks.
Specifically, we analyze how attackers may interfere with the results of
regression learning by poisoning the training datasets. To this end, we analyze
and develop a new poisoning attack algorithm. Our attack, termed Nopt, in
contrast with previous poisoning attack algorithms, can produce larger errors
with the same proportion of poisoning data-points. Furthermore, we also
significantly improve the state-of-the-art defense algorithm, termed TRIM,
proposed by Jagielsk et al. (IEEE S&P 2018), by incorporating the concept of
probability estimation of clean data-points into the algorithm. Our new defense
algorithm, termed Proda, demonstrates an increased effectiveness in reducing
errors arising from the poisoning dataset through optimizing ensemble models.
We highlight that the time complexity of TRIM had not been estimated; however,
we deduce from their work that TRIM can take exponential time complexity in the
worst-case scenario, in excess of Proda's logarithmic time. The performance of
both our proposed attack and defense algorithms is extensively evaluated on
four real-world datasets of housing prices, loans, health care, and bike
sharing services. We hope that our work will inspire future research to develop
more robust learning algorithms immune to poisoning attacks.

outer space through the atmospheric transmission windows. Due to its passive

instance, the walls of buildings have >50% of their field of view subtended by
the earth. Moreover, objects on earth become sources of heat under sunlight.
Therefore, building walls with hot terrestrial objects in view experience
reduced cooling or heating, even with materials optimized for heat loss into
the sky. We show that by using materials with selective long-wavelength
infrared (LWIR) emittances, vertical building facades experience higher cooling
than achievable by using broadband thermal emitters like typical building

potential $Q[g_{jk}]$ as the natural candidate for the dark energy. This leads
to the WDW Hamilton-Jacobi equation with a vanishing kinetic term, and with the
identification $$ \Lambda=-\frac{\kappa^2}{\sqrt{\bar g}}Q[g_{jk}] \ . $$ This
shows that the cosmological constant is a quantum correction of the Einstein

to a graviton condensate. Time independence of the regularized WDW equation
suggests that the ratio between the Planck length and the Hubble radius may be
a time constant, providing an infrared/ultraviolet duality. We speculate that
such a duality is related to the local to global geometry theorems for constant

problem of learning a discrete graphical model given i.i.d samples from its

convex optimization method known as Generalized Regularized Interaction
Screening Estimator (GRISE). But the computational cost of GRISE becomes
prohibitive when the energy function of the true graphical model has
higher-order terms. We introduce NeurISE, a neural net based algorithm for

The optimization of this objective then produces a neural-net representation
for the conditionals of the graphical model. NeurISE algorithm is seen to be a
better alternative to GRISE when the energy function of the true model has a
high order with a high degree of symmetry. In these cases NeurISE is able to
find the correct parsimonious representation for the conditionals without being
fed any prior information about the true model. NeurISE can also be used to
learn the underlying structure of the true model with some simple modifications
to its training procedure. In addition, we also show a variant of NeurISE that

There is a rich body of work on this problem, in varying streaming and

graph. In many scenarios, we do not have access to the whole graph, and can
only sample a small portion of the graph (typically through crawling). In such
a setting, how can we accurately estimate the triangle count of the graph?
  We formally study triangle counting in the {\em random walk} access model
introduced by Dasgupta et al (WWW '14) and Chierichetti et al (WWW '16). We
have access to an arbitrary seed vertex of the graph, and can only perform
random walks. This model is restrictive in access and captures the challenges
of collecting real-world graphs. Even sampling a uniform random vertex is a
hard task in this model.
  Despite these challenges, we design a provable and practical algorithm,
TETRIS, for triangle counting in this model. TETRIS is the first provably
sublinear algorithm (for most natural parameter settings) that approximates the
triangle count in the random walk model, for graphs with low mixing time. Our
result builds on recent advances in the theory of sublinear algorithms. The
final sample built by TETRIS is a careful mix of random walks and degree-biased
sampling of neighborhoods. Empirically, TETRIS accurately counts triangles on a
variety of large graphs, getting estimates within 5\% relative error by looking

control queries (p=0.0024), time (p=0.001), and seasonality (Winter p=0.0028;
Spring p<0.001; Summer p=0.018). Regression model 2 predicted DED queries per

coastal zone (p=0.025). Importantly, temperature, coastal status, and
seasonality were stronger risk factors of DED searches than humidity, sunshine,

During these years, energy more than $7\times10^{50}$ erg was released in the
infrared, and the flare's MIR color was generally turning red. We detected
neither optical nor ultraviolet (UV) variation corresponding to the MIR flare
based on available data. We explained the MIR flare using a dust echo model in
which the radiative transfer is involved. The MIR flare can be well explained
as thermal reradiation from dust heated by UV-optical photons of a primary
nuclear transient event. Although the transient event was not seen directly due
to dust obscuration, we can infer that it may produce a total energy of at
least $\sim10^{51}$ erg, most of which was released in less than $\sim$3 years.
The nature of the transient event could be a stellar tidal disruption event by
the central supermassive black hole (SMBH), or a sudden enhancement of the
existing accretion flow onto the SMBH, or a supernova which was particularly

storage efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Pruning removes
near-zero weights in tensors and masks weak connections between neurons in
neighbouring layers. Quantization reduces the precision of weights by replacing
them with numerically similar values that require less storage. In this paper,
we identify another form of redundancy in CNN weight tensors, in the form of
repeated patterns of similar values. We observe that pruning and quantization
both tend to drastically increase the number of repeated patterns in the weight

computational advantages over other neural representations of sensory data. To
explore this viewpoint, a sparse code is used to represent natural images in an
optimal control task solved with neuro-dynamic programming, and its
computational properties are investigated. The central finding is that when
feature inputs to a linear network are correlated, an over-complete sparse code
increases the memory capacity of the network in an efficient manner beyond that
possible for any complete code with the same-sized input, and also increases
the speed of learning the network weights. A complete sparse code is found to
maximise the memory capacity of a linear network by decorrelating its feature
inputs to transform the design matrix of the least-squares problem to one of
full rank. It also conditions the Hessian matrix of the least-squares problem,
thereby increasing the rate of convergence to the optimal network weights.
Other types of decorrelating codes would also achieve this. However, an
over-complete sparse code is found to be approximately decorrelated, extracting
a larger number of approximately decorrelated features from the same-sized
input, allowing it to efficiently increase memory capacity beyond that possible
for any complete code: a 2.25 times over-complete sparse code is shown to at
least double memory capacity compared with a complete sparse code using the
same input. This is used in sequential learning to store a potentially large
number of optimal control tasks in the network, while catastrophic forgetting
is avoided using a partitioned representation, yielding a cost-to-go function
approximator that generalizes over the states in each partition. Sparse code
advantages over dense codes and local codes are also discussed.

crisis. This interior crisis evolves through merging of a cascade of
period-doubling and period-adding bifurcations that leads to the origin of
occasional amplitude-modulated extremely large events. More categorically, a
situation similar to homoclinic chaos arises near the critical point, however,
atypical global instability evolves as a channel-like structure in phase space
of the system that modulates variability of amplitude and return time of the
occasional large events and makes a difference from the homoclinic chaos. The
slow-fast timescale of the low-dimensional model plays an important role on the
onset of occasional extremely large events. Such extreme events are
characterized by their heights when they exceed a threshold level measured by a
mean-excess function. The probability density of events' height displays
multimodal distribution with an upper-bounded tail. We identify the dependence

as a study, involves numerous trials of training a model using different
training knobs, and therefore is very computation-heavy, typically taking hours
and days to finish. We observe that trials issued from hyper-parameter
optimization algorithms often share common hyper-parameter sequence prefixes.
Based on this observation, we propose Hippo, a hyper-parameter optimization
system that removes redundancy in the training process to reduce the overall
amount of computation significantly. Instead of executing each trial
independently as in existing hyper-parameter optimization systems, Hippo breaks
down the hyper-parameter sequences into stages and merges common stages to form
a tree of stages (called a stage-tree), then executes a stage once per tree on
a distributed GPU server environment. Hippo is applicable to not only single
studies, but multi-study scenarios as well, where multiple studies of the same
model and search space can be formulated as trees of stages. Evaluations show
that Hippo's stage-based execution strategy outperforms trial-based methods

algorithms, reducing GPU-hours and end-to-end training time significantly.

containing a detached black hole (BH). We show that the system is a binary and
does not contain a BH. Using spectral decomposition, we disentangle the
observed composite spectra into two components: a rapidly rotating Be star and
a slowly rotating B star with low surface gravity $(\log g \approx 2.75)$. Both
stars show periodic radial velocity (RV) variability, but the RV semi-amplitude
of the B star's orbit is $K_{\rm B}= (62.7 \pm 1)\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$, while that
of the Be star is only $K_{\rm Be} = (4.5\pm 2)\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$. This implies
that the B star is less massive by at least a factor of 10. The surface
abundances of the B star bear imprints of CNO burning. We argue that the B star
is a bloated, recently stripped helium star with mass $\approx 0.5\,M_{\odot}$
that is currently contracting to become a hot subdwarf. The orbital motion of
the Be star obviates the need for a BH to explain the B star's motion. A
stripped-star model reproduces the observed luminosity of the system, while a
normal star with the B star's temperature and gravity would be more than 10
times too luminous. HR 6819 and the binary LB-1 probably formed through similar
channels. We use MESA models to investigate their evolutionary history, finding
that they likely formed from intermediate-mass ($3-7\,M_{\odot}$) primaries
stripped by slightly lower-mass secondaries and are progenitors to Be + sdOB
binaries such as $\phi$ Persei. The lifetime of their current evolutionary
phase is on average $2\times 10^5$ years, of order half a percent of the total
lifetime of the Be phase. This implies that many Be stars have hot subdwarf and
white dwarf companions, and that a substantial fraction ($20-100\%$) of field
Be stars form through accretion of material from a binary companion.

Recently, a theoretical model of the hippocampus based on temporal difference
(TD) learning has been published. Inspired by the successor representation (SR)
learning algorithms, which decompose value function of TD learning into reward
and state transition, they argued that the rate of firing of CA1 place cells in
the hippocampus represents the probability of state transition. This theory,
called predictive map theory, claims that the hippocampus representing space
learns the probability of transition from the current state to the future
state. The neural correlates of expecting the future state are the firing rates
of the CA1 place cells. This explanation is plausible for the results recorded
in behavioral experiments, but it is lacking the neurobiological implications.
  Modifying the SR learning algorithm added biological implications to the
predictive map theory. Similar with the simultaneous needs of information of
the current and future state in the SR learning algorithm, the CA1 place cells
receive two inputs from CA3 and entorhinal cortex. Mathematical transformation
showed that the SR learning algorithm is equivalent to the heterosynaptic
plasticity rule. The heterosynaptic plasticity phenomena in CA1 were discussed
and compared with the modified SR update rule. This study attempted to
interpret the TD algorithm as the neurobiological mechanism occurring in place
learning, and to integrate the neuroscience and artificial intelligence
approaches in the field.

few classes account for most of the examples. This long-tail causes classifiers
to overfit to the majority class. To mitigate this, prior solutions commonly
adopt class rebalancing strategies such as data resampling and loss reshaping.
However, by treating each example within a class equally, these methods fail to
account for the important notion of example hardness, i.e., within each class
some examples are easier to classify than others. To incorporate this notion of
hardness into the learning process, we propose the EarLy-exiting

auxiliary branches attached to a backbone network. This offers a dual
benefit-(1) the neural network increasingly focuses on hard examples, since
they contribute more to the overall network loss; and (2) it frees up
additional model capacity to distinguish difficult examples. Experimental

demonstrate that ELF can improve state-of-the-art accuracy by more than 3
percent. This comes with the additional benefit of reducing up to 20 percent of

We infer the physical parameters of chromospheric plasmas from these lines

inversion. We assume that the atmosphere consists of a finite number of layers.
In each layer the absorption profile is constant and the source function varies
with optical depth with a constant gradient. Specifically, we consider a
three-layer model of radiative transfer where the lowest layer is identified
with the photosphere and the two upper layers are identified with the
chromosphere. The absorption profile in the photosphere is described by a Voigt
function, and the profile in the chromosphere by a Gaussian function. This
three-layer model is fully specified by 13 parameters. Four parameters can be
fixed to prescribed values, and one parameter can be determined from the
analysis of a satellite photospheric line. The remaining 8 parameters are
determined from a constrained least-squares fitting. We applied the multilayer
spectral inversion to the spectral data of the H$\alpha$ and the Ca II 854.21
nm lines taken in a quiet region by the Fast Imaging Solar Spectrograph (FISS)
of the Goode Solar Telescope (GST). We find that our model successfully fits
most of the observed profiles and produces regular maps of the model
parameters. The combination of the inferred Doppler widths of the two lines
yields reasonable estimates of temperature and nonthermal speed in the
chromosphere. We conclude that our multilayer inversion is useful to infer
chromospheric plasma parameters on the Sun.

Developing composite CFs by adding nanoadditives is very promising for low-cost
CFs. Therefore, a fundamental understanding of carbonization condition impacts
and polymer/additives conversion mechanisms during whole CF production are
essential to develop low-cost CFs. In this work, we have demonstrated how the
carbonization temperature affects the PAN/graphene CFs properties by performing
a series of ReaxFF based molecular dynamics simulations. We found that graphene
edges along with the nitrogen and oxygen functional groups have a catalytic
role and act as seeds for the graphitic structure growth. Our MD simulations
unveil that the addition of the graphene to PAN precursor modifies all-carbon
membered rings in CFs and enhances the alignments of 6-member carbon rings in
carbonization which leads to superior mechanical properties compare to
PAN-based CFs. These ReaxFF simulation results are validates by experimental
structural and mechanical characterizations. Interestingly, mechanical
characterizations indicate that PAN/graphene CFs carbonized at 1250 C
demonstrate 90.9% increase in strength and 101.9% enhancement in Young's
modulus compare to the PAN-based CFs carbonized at 1500 C. The superior
mechanical properties of PAN/graphene CFs at lower carbonization temperatures
offers a path to both energy savings and cost reduction by decreasing the

digital images. Most recently proposed deep-learning-based image compression
methods leverage the auto-encoder structure, and reach a series of promising
results in this field. The images are encoded into low dimensional latent
features first, and entropy coded subsequently by exploiting the statistical
redundancy. However, the information lost during encoding is unfortunately
inevitable, which poses a significant challenge to the decoder to reconstruct
the original images. In this work, we propose a novel invertible framework
called Invertible Lossy Compression (ILC) to largely mitigate the information
loss problem. Specifically, ILC introduces an invertible encoding module to
replace the encoder-decoder structure to produce the low dimensional
informative latent representation, meanwhile, transform the lost information
into an auxiliary latent variable that won't be further coded or stored. The
latent representation is quantized and encoded into bit-stream, and the latent
variable is forced to follow a specified distribution, i.e. isotropic Gaussian
distribution. In this way, recovering the original image is made tractable by
easily drawing a surrogate latent variable and applying the inverse pass of the
module with the sampled variable and decoded latent features. Experimental
results demonstrate that with a new component replacing the auto-encoder in
image compression methods, ILC can significantly outperform the baseline method
on extensive benchmark datasets by combining with the existing compression
algorithms.

method named progressive self-knowledge distillation (PS-KD), which
progressively distills a model's own knowledge to soften hard targets (i.e.,
one-hot vectors) during training. Hence, it can be interpreted within a
framework of knowledge distillation as a student becomes a teacher itself.
Specifically, targets are adjusted adaptively by combining the ground-truth and
past predictions from the model itself. We show that PS-KD provides an effect
of hard example mining by rescaling gradients according to difficulty in
classifying examples. The proposed method is applicable to any supervised
learning tasks with hard targets and can be easily combined with existing
regularization methods to further enhance the generalization performance.
Furthermore, it is confirmed that PS-KD achieves not only better accuracy, but
also provides high quality of confidence estimates in terms of calibration as

graph (KG)? Node importance estimation is a crucial and challenging task that
can benefit a lot of applications including recommendation, search, and query
disambiguation. A key challenge towards this goal is how to effectively use
input from different sources. On the one hand, a KG is a rich source of
information, with multiple types of nodes and edges. On the other hand, there
are external input signals, such as the number of votes or pageviews, which can
directly tell us about the importance of entities in a KG. While several
methods have been developed to tackle this problem, their use of these external
signals has been limited as they are not designed to consider multiple signals
simultaneously. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end model MultiImport,
which infers latent node importance from multiple, potentially overlapping,
input signals. MultiImport is a latent variable model that captures the
relation between node importance and input signals, and effectively learns from
multiple signals with potential conflicts. Also, MultiImport provides an
effective estimator based on attentive graph neural networks. We ran
experiments on real-world KGs to show that MultiImport handles several
challenges involved with inferring node importance from multiple input signals,

exponential growth, the maximum likelihood estimation, sequential Bayesian
method and estimation of time-dependent reproduction. The best fit (based on

approach was used to assess the impact on the effective reproduction rate. The
period of pre-lockdown to the end of lockdown 3, saw a $45\%$ reduction in the
rate of effective reproduction rate. During the same period the growth rate
reduced from $393\%$ during the pre-lockdown to $33\%$ after lockdown 3,
accompanied by the average doubling time increasing form $4$-$6$ days to
$12$-$14$ days. Finally, the death-to-recovery ratio dropped from $0.28$

favourable changes, from the pre-lockdown period to the end of lockdown 3.
Analysis of the data in the post-lockdown period with these metrics will

learning the largest class of joint-action value functions up to date. However,

performance in complex environments, such as Starcraft Multi-Agent Challenge

(i) stabilizing the training objective of QTRAN, (ii) removing the strict role
separation between the action-value estimators of QTRAN, and (iii) introducing
a multi-head mixing network for value transformation. Through extensive
evaluation, we confirm that our diagnosis is correct, and QTRAN++ successfully
bridges the gap between empirical performance and theoretical guarantee. In

agrees on the distribution of the point cloud in the bounding box, which means
the corner with denser observed points has lower uncertainty. Moreover, our

one-time private synopsis of the data, to which users can make an unlimited
number of queries. However, existing systems using synopses are built for
offline use cases, where a set of queries is known ahead of time and the system
carefully optimizes a synopsis for it. The synopses that these systems build

  We introduce Overlook, a system that enables private data exploration at
interactive latencies for both data analysts and data curators. The key idea in
Overlook is a virtual synopsis that can be evaluated incrementally, without
extra space storage or expensive precomputation. Overlook simply executes
queries using an existing engine, such as a SQL DBMS, and adds noise to their
results. Because Overlook's synopses do not require costly precomputation or
storage, data curators can also use Overlook to explore the impact of privacy
parameters interactively. Overlook offers a rich visual query interface based

that pure water is unable to stabilize the AgI crystal in a physically

novel Hamiltonian representations to solve optimization problems. One of these
advances has centered around the development of driver Hamiltonians that
commute with the constraints of an optimization problem - allowing for another
avenue to satisfying those constraints instead of imposing penalty terms for
each of them. In particular, the approach is able to use sparser connectivity
to embed several practical problems on quantum devices than other common
practices. However, designing the driver Hamiltonians that successfully commute
with several constraints has largely been based on strong intuition for
specific problems and with no simple general algorithm to generate them for
arbitrary constraints. In this work, we develop a simple and intuitive
algebraic framework for reasoning about the commutation of Hamiltonians with
linear constraints - one that allows us to classify the complexity of finding a
driver Hamiltonian for an arbitrary set of constraints as NP-Complete. Because
unitary operators are exponentials of Hermitian operators, these results can
also be applied to the construction of mixers in the Quantum Alternating

this was attributed to the geometrical-size effects caused by crystal symmetry,
the ordered arrangement of grains, and the anisotropic interface

Based on the accuracy of our experimental results, the magnitude of spin Hall

Networks (CNNs). In this paper, we propose to augment a convolutional layer
with an additional depthwise convolution, where each input channel is convolved
with a different 2D kernel. The composition of the two convolutions constitutes
an over-parameterization, since it adds learnable parameters, while the
resulting linear operation can be expressed by a single convolution layer. We
refer to this depthwise over-parameterized convolutional layer as DO-Conv. We
show with extensive experiments that the mere replacement of conventional
convolutional layers with DO-Conv layers boosts the performance of CNNs on many
classical vision tasks, such as image classification, detection, and
segmentation. Moreover, in the inference phase, the depthwise convolution is
folded into the conventional convolution, reducing the computation to be
exactly equivalent to that of a convolutional layer without
over-parameterization. As DO-Conv introduces performance gains without
incurring any computational complexity increase for inference, we advocate it
as an alternative to the conventional convolutional layer. We open-source a
reference implementation of DO-Conv in Tensorflow, PyTorch and GluonCV at

constructions on cryptocurrency blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Many of
these constructions, including operational payment channels and atomic swaps,
use a building block called Hashed Time-Locked Contract (HTLC).
  In this work, we distill from HTLC a specification (HTLC-Spec), and present
an implementation called Mutual-Assured-Destruction Hashed Time-Locked Contract
(MAD-HTLC). MAD-HTLC employs a novel approach of utilizing the existing
blockchain operators, called miners, as part of the design. If a user
misbehaves, MAD-HTLC incentivizes the miners to confiscate all her funds. We
prove MAD-HTLC's security using the UC framework and game-theoretic analysis.
We demonstrate MAD-HTLC's efficacy and analyze its overhead by instantiating it
on Bitcoin's and Ethereum's operational blockchains.
  Notably, current miner software makes only little effort to optimize revenue,
since the advantage is relatively small. However, as the demand grows and other
revenue components shrink, miners are more motivated to fully optimize their
fund intake. By patching the standard Bitcoin client, we demonstrate such
optimization is easy to implement, making the miners natural enforcers of
MAD-HTLC.
  Finally, we extend previous results regarding HTLC vulnerability to bribery
attacks. An attacker can incentivize miners to prefer her transactions by
offering high transaction fees. We demonstrate this attack can be easily
implemented by patching the Bitcoin client, and use game-theoretic tools to
qualitatively tighten the known cost bound of such bribery attacks in presence
of rational miners. We identify bribe opportunities occurring on the Bitcoin
and Ethereum main networks where a few dollars bribe could yield tens of
thousands of dollars in reward (e.g., \$2 for over \$25K).

  Sankaran and Uma generalized the ""Stanley-Reisner description"" to the case of

interesting solution as it can be efficiently implemented at the physical layer

compare the secret-key capacity based on the sampling of the entire complex

the fact that the eavesdropper's observations might be correlated and we
consider the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime where we can find simple
analytical expressions for the secret-key capacity. As already found in
previous works, we find that RSS-based secret-key generation is heavily

precisely and simply quantify this penalty: a halved pre-log factor and a
constant penalty of about 0.69 bit, which disappears as Eve's channel gets

supervised. These fully supervised approaches heavily rely on large amounts of
labeled training data that are difficult to obtain and cannot segment new

attention-aware multi-prototype transductive few-shot point cloud semantic
segmentation method to segment new classes given a few labeled examples.
Specifically, each class is represented by multiple prototypes to model the
complex data distribution of labeled points. Subsequently, we employ a
transductive label propagation method to exploit the affinities between labeled
multi-prototypes and unlabeled points, and among the unlabeled points.
Furthermore, we design an attention-aware multi-level feature learning network
to learn the discriminative features that capture the geometric dependencies
and semantic correlations between points. Our proposed method shows significant
and consistent improvements compared to baselines in different few-shot point
cloud semantic segmentation settings (i.e., 2/3-way 1/5-shot) on two benchmark

independently when to arrive to a facility that provides a service during a
fixed period of time, say a day. This is a common scenario in many service
systems such as a bank, lunch at a cafeteria, music concert, flight check-in
and many others. High demand for service at a specific time leads to congestion
that comes at a cost, e.g., for waiting, earliness or tardiness. Queueing
Theory provides tools for the analysis of the waiting times and associated
costs. If customers have the option of deciding when to join the queue, they
will face a decision dilemma of when to arrive. The level of congestion one
suffers from depends on others behavior and not only that of the individual
under consideration. This fact leads customers to make strategic decisions
regarding their time of arrival. In addition, multiple decision makers that
affect each other's expected congestion, call for non-cooperative game
theoretic analysis of this strategic interaction. This common daily scenario
has prompted a research stream pioneered by the ?/M/1 model of Glazer and
Hassin (GH1983) that first characterized an arrival process to a queue as a
Nash equilibrium solution of a game. This survey provides an overview of the
main results and developments in the literature on queueing systems with
strategic timing of arrivals. Another issue is that of social optimality,
namely the strategy profile used by customers that optimizes their aggregate
utility. In particular, we review results concerning the price of anarchy
(PoA), which is the ratio between the socially optimal and the equilibrium
utilities.

numerically study whether this behavior of the flow field can be simulated by a
2D stochastic Navier-Stokes (NS) equation for Couette flow, in which random
Brownian force is assumed. We present the first numerical evidence that these

Brownian motion of the fluid particles plays an essential role in the emergence
of these peaks in the velocity distribution. We also find that the position of
the peak at $V_x(\not=\!0)$ moves with the variation in the strength $D$ of the
random Brownian force, which also changes depending on physical parameters such
as the kinematic viscosity, boundary velocity and diameter of the plant cells.

the long-term behavior of the recurrent unit using tools from nonlinear systems
theory. In turn, this enables architectural design decisions before
experimentation. Sufficient conditions for global stability of the recurrent
unit are obtained, motivating a novel scheme for constructing hidden-to-hidden
matrices. Our experiments demonstrate that the Lipschitz RNN can outperform
existing recurrent units on a range of benchmark tasks, including computer
vision, language modeling and speech prediction tasks. Finally, through
Hessian-based analysis we demonstrate that our Lipschitz recurrent unit is more
robust with respect to input and parameter perturbations as compared to other
continuous-time RNNs.

on either rigging or inverse kinematics (IK) to associate a consistent skeleton
with temporally coherent joint rotations, our method is the first data-driven
approach that directly outputs a kinematic skeleton, which is a complete,
commonly used, motion representation. At the crux of our approach lies a deep
neural network with embedded kinematic priors, which decomposes sequences of 2D
joint positions into two separate attributes: a single, symmetric, skeleton,
encoded by bone lengths, and a sequence of 3D joint rotations associated with
global root positions and foot contact labels. These attributes are fed into an
integrated forward kinematics (FK) layer that outputs 3D positions, which are
compared to a ground truth. In addition, an adversarial loss is applied to the
velocities of the recovered rotations, to ensure that they lie on the manifold
of natural joint rotations. The key advantage of our approach is that it learns
to infer natural joint rotations directly from the training data, rather than
assuming an underlying model, or inferring them from joint positions using a
data-agnostic IK solver. We show that enforcing a single consistent skeleton
along with temporally coherent joint rotations constrains the solution space,
leading to a more robust handling of self-occlusions and depth ambiguities.

biology to epidemiology and allows us to express a broad class of models for

millimeter and submm wavelengths are fundamental tools to understand the role
of magnetic fields (MF) in channeling filament material into prestellar cores
providing a unique insight in the physics of galactic star-forming regions.
Among other topics, at extra-galactic scales, polarization observations of AGNs
will allow us to constrain the possible physical conditions of the emitting
plasma from the jets and/or exploring the physics of dust inside supernova
remnants. The kilo-pixel NIKA2 camera, installed at the IRAM 30-m telescope,
represents today one of the best tools available to the astronomers to produce
simultaneous intensity/polarimetry maps over large fields at 260 GHz (1.15 mm).
AIMS.The polarization measurement, in NIKA and NIKA2, is achieved by rapidly
modulating the total incoming polarization. This allows in the end to safely
isolate the small science signal from the large, un-polarized and strongly
variable, atmospheric background. METHODS.The polarization modulation is
achieved by inserting a fast rotating Half-Wave Plate (HWP) in the optical
beam. In order to allow wide field-of-view observations, the plate has to be
large, with a diameter exceeding 250 mm. The modulation of the polarized
signal, at 12 Hz, requires also the waveplate to be sufficiently light. In
addition, this key optical element has to exhibit optimal electromagnetic
characteristics in terms of transmission and differential phase-shift. For this
purpose, three metamaterial HWPs have been developed using the mesh-filter
technology. The knowledge acquired in developing the first two single-band HWPs
was used to achieve the more challenging performance requirements of the last
dual-band HWP. The first and the third waveplates met the requirements for both
the NIKA and NIKA2 instruments. RESULTS.(abridged)

on eliminating less important filters or constructing efficient operations,

feature maps within a layer share similar but not identical patterns. However,
it is difficult to identify if features with similar patterns are redundant or
contain essential details. Therefore, instead of directly removing uncertain
redundant features, we propose a \textbf{sp}lit based \textbf{conv}olutional

require less computation. Specifically, we split input feature maps into the
representative part and the uncertain redundant part, where intrinsic

processed with some light-weight operation. To recalibrate and fuse these two

properties is one of the basic concerns for the material design and
applications. As a ubiquitous structural configuration in nature, the folded
morphology is also widely observed in graphene-based nanomaterials, namely
grafold. Recently, a self-folded graphene film (SF-GF) material has been
successfully fabricated by the assembly of grafolds and exhibits promising
applications in thermal management. However, the dependence of thermal
properties of SF-GF on the structural features of grafold has still remained
unclear. We here develop an analytical model to describe the thermal transport
behavior in SF-GF. Our model demonstrates the relationship between the geometry
of grafolds and thermal properties of SF-GF. The predictions of temperature
profile and thermal conductivity are well validated by molecular dynamics
simulations. Using this model, we further study the evolution of thermal
conductivity of SF-GF with the unfolding deformation during stretch. Moreover,
the effect of geometrical irregularity of grafolds is uncovered. Interestingly,
the predicted transport behaviors of SF-GF under stretch fit some analogous
experimental observations reported in graphene-based strain sensor. Our results
not only reveal the mechanisms behind some physical phenomenon in the
applications of graphene-based devices, but also provide practical guidelines

cine imaging. However, all of these methods are only driven by the sparse prior
of MR images, while the important low-rank (LR) prior of dynamic MR cine images
is not explored, which limits the further improvements on dynamic MR
reconstruction. In this paper, a learned singular value thresholding
(Learned-SVT) operation is proposed to explore deep low-rank prior in dynamic
MR imaging for obtaining improved reconstruction results. In particular, we
come up with two novel and distinct schemes to introduce the learnable low-rank
prior into deep network architectures in an unrolling manner and a
plug-and-play manner respectively. In the unrolling manner, we put forward a
model-based unrolling sparse and low-rank network for dynamic MR imaging,
dubbed SLR-Net. The SLR-Net is defined over a deep network flow graph, which is
unrolled from the iterative procedures in the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding
Algorithm (ISTA) for optimizing a sparse and low-rank based dynamic MRI model.
In the plug-and-play manner, we present a plug-and-play LR network module that
can be easily embedded into any other dynamic MR neural networks without
changing the network paradigm. Experimental results show that both schemes can
further improve the state-of-the-art CS methods, such as k-t SLR, and
sparsity-driven deep learning-based methods, such as DC-CNN and CRNN, both

much-debated topic among practitioners: they are much cheaper than traditional
air quality monitoring stations set up by public authorities (a few hundred
dollars compared to a few dozens of thousand dollars) at the cost of a lower
accuracy and robustness. This paper presents a case study of using low-cost
sensors measurements in an air quality prediction engine. The engine predicts
jointly PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations in the United States at a very high
resolution in the range of a few dozens of meters.
  It is fed with the measurements provided by official air quality monitoring
stations, the measurements provided by a network of more than 4000 low-cost
sensors across the country, and traffic estimates. We show that the use of
low-cost sensors' measurements improves the engine's accuracy very
significantly. In particular, we derive a strong link between the density of
low-cost sensors and the predictions' accuracy: the more low-cost sensors are
in an area, the more accurate are the predictions. As an illustration, in areas
with the highest density of low-cost sensors, the low-cost sensors'
measurements bring a 25% and 15% improvement in PM2.5 and PM10 predictions'
accuracy respectively.
  An other strong conclusion is that in some areas with a high density of
low-cost sensors, the engine performs better when fed with low-cost sensors'
measurements only than when fed with official monitoring stations' measurements
only: this suggests that an air quality monitoring network composed of low-cost
sensors is effective in monitoring air quality. This is a very important
result, as such a monitoring network is much cheaper to set up.

machine learning methods to discriminate six stages of PD. The data was
acquired by low cost walker-mounted sensors in an experiment at a movement
disorders clinic and the PD stages were clinically labeled. A large set of
features, some unique to this study are extracted and three feature selection
methods are compared using a multi-class Random Forest (RF) classifier. The
feature subset selected by the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) method provided
performance similar to the full feature set: 93% accuracy and had significantly
shorter computation time. Compared to PCA, this method also enabled clinical
interpretability of the selected features, an essential attribute to healthcare
applications. All selected-feature sets are dominated by information theoretic
features and statistical features and offer insights into the characteristics

learning to accurately classify PD severity stages from kinematic signals

adjacent porous medium is a key issue for physically consistent modeling and

conditions available in the literature have several weak points: most of them
are suitable only for flows parallel to the fluid-porous interface, some are
restricted to specific boundary value problems, and others contain unknown

restrict the variety of applications that can be successfully modeled. We

These coupling conditions are rigorously derived using the theory of
homogenization and boundary layers. All effective parameters appearing in these

scenario considers a more challenging case, where the labeled data is only

tackle the problems, which we refer to as Federated Matching (FedMatch).
FedMatch improves upon naive combinations of federated learning and
semi-supervised learning approaches with a new inter-client consistency loss
and decomposition of the parameters for disjoint learning on labeled and
unlabeled data. Through extensive experimental validation of our method in the
two different scenarios, we show that our method outperforms both local

find that the HI mass increases with the halo mass up to a critical mass of

scatter in the relation increases by 0.7 dex and the HI mass decreases with the

around that mass is extremely sensitive to how AGN feedback is modelled, with
other physical processes playing a less significant role. We determine the main
secondary parameters responsible for the scatter of the HI-halo mass relation,

the fractional contribution from substructure to the total halo mass for

non-stationary segments which is computationally expensive, inaccurate and
often impossible. These models are thus not fully unsupervised. We remedy these
limitations by combining nonlinear ICA with a Hidden Markov Model, resulting in
a model where a latent state acts in place of the observed segment-index. We
prove identifiability of the proposed model for a general mixing nonlinearity,
such as a neural network. We also show how maximum likelihood estimation of the
model can be done using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Thus, we
achieve a new nonlinear ICA framework which is unsupervised, more efficient, as
well as able to model underlying temporal dynamics.

blocks of many photonic, photovoltaic and electronic devices, thanks to the
associated direct band-gap and the highly tunable optoelectronic properties.
The selection of a suitable material system is crucial for custom designed
nanowires tailored for optimised device performance. The bismuth containing
GaAs materials are an imminent class of semiconductors which not only enable an
exquisite control over the alloy strain and electronic structure but also offer
the possibility to suppress internal loss mechanisms in photonic devices.
Whilst the experimental efforts to incorporate GaBiAs alloys in the nanowire
active region are still in primitive stage, the theoretical understanding of
the optoelectronic properties of such nanowires is only rudimentary. This work
elucidates and quantifies the role of nanowire physical attributes such as its
geometry parameters and bismuth incorporation in designing light absorption
wavelength and polarisation response. Based on multi-million atom tight-binding
simulations of the GaBiAs/GaAs core$-$shell and GaAs/GaBiAs/GaAs multi$-$shell
nanowires, our results predict a large tuning of the absorption wavelength,
ranging from 0.9 $\mu$m to 1.6 $\mu$m, which can be controlled by engineering
either Bi composition or nanowire diameter. The analysis of the strain profiles
indicates a tensile character leading to significant light-hole mixing in the
valence band states. This offers a possibility to achieve
polarisation-insensitive light interaction, which is desirable for several
photonic devices involving amplification and modulation of light. Furthermore,
at low Bi compositions, the carrier confinement is quasi type-II, which further
broadens the suitability of these nanowires for myriad applications demanding
large carrier separations...

proposed to prevent catastrophic forgetting, a thorough investigation of their
effectiveness for processing sequential data with recurrent neural networks

established CL methods on a variety of sequential data benchmarks.
Specifically, we shed light on the particularities that arise when applying
weight-importance methods, such as elastic weight consolidation, to RNNs. In
contrast to feedforward networks, RNNs iteratively reuse a shared set of
weights and require working memory to process input samples. We show that the
performance of weight-importance methods is not directly affected by the length
of the processed sequences, but rather by high working memory requirements,
which lead to an increased need for stability at the cost of decreased
plasticity for learning subsequent tasks. We additionally provide theoretical
arguments supporting this interpretation by studying linear RNNs. Our study
shows that established CL methods can be successfully ported to the recurrent
case, and that a recent regularization approach based on hypernetworks
outperforms weight-importance methods, thus emerging as a promising candidate
for CL in RNNs. Overall, we provide insights on the differences between CL in
feedforward networks and RNNs, while guiding towards effective solutions to
tackle CL on sequential data.

relax the assumption of the usual boundedness into boundedness in the sense of
distribution which we refer to as a bounded generalized function. The set of
bounded generalized functions are wider than the set of usual bounded
functions. Then, upon assuming that $u$ is a bounded generalized function and

Moreover, we show that the first partial derivatives of the solution $\partial

communication networks, which on one hand can significantly improve the
communication performance, and on the other hand poses new challenges of
solving the corresponding optimization problems due to the large problem size.
While various efficient algorithms such as semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based
approaches have been proposed for solving the small-scale MIMO detection
problem, they are not suitable to solve the large-scale MIMO detection problem
due to their high computational complexities. In this paper, we propose an
efficient sparse quadratic programming (SQP) relaxation based algorithm for
solving the large-scale MIMO detection problem. In particular, we first
reformulate the MIMO detection problem as an SQP problem. By dropping the
sparse constraint, the resulting relaxation problem shares the same global
minimizer with the SQP problem. In sharp contrast to the SDRs for the MIMO
detection problem, our relaxation does not contain any (positive semidefinite)
matrix variable and the numbers of variables and constraints in our relaxation
are significantly less than those in the SDRs, which makes it particularly
suitable for the large-scale problem. Then we propose a projected Newton based
quadratic penalty method to solve the relaxation problem, which is guaranteed
to converge to the vector of transmitted signals under reasonable conditions.
By extensive numerical experiments, when applied to solve large-scale problems,
the proposed algorithm achieves better detection performance than a recently

global structure of data, so distances in the low-dimensional structure found
are meaningful. The LDA applied to the CNN features finds that the centroids of
classes corresponding to the similar data lay closer than classes corresponding
to different data. We applied the method to a modification of the MNIST dataset
with ten additional classes, each new class with half of the images from one of
the standard ten classes. The method finds the new classes close to the
corresponding standard classes we took the data form. We also applied the
method to a dataset of images of butterflies to find that related subspecies
are found to be close. For both datasets, we find a performance similar to
state-of-the-art methods.

found important applications in sensor network localization and molecular
conformation. It can also be viewed as a matrix formulation of multidimensional
scaling, which is to embed n points in a $r$-dimensional space such that the
resulting distances follow the ordinal constraints. The ordinal constraints,
though proved to be quite useful, may result in only zero solution when too
many are added, leaving the feasibility of EDMOC as a question. In this paper,
we first study the feasibility of EDMOC systematically. We show that if $r\ge
n-2$, EDMOC always admits a nontrivial solution. Otherwise, it may have only
zero solution. The latter interprets the numerical observations of 'crowding
phenomenon'. Next we overcome two obstacles in designing fast algorithms for
EDMOC, i.e., the low-rankness and the potential huge number of ordinal
constraints. We apply the technique developed to take the low rank constraint
as the conditional positive semidefinite cone with rank cut. This leads to a
majorization penalty approach. The ordinal constraints are left to the
subproblem, which is exactly the weighted isotonic regression, and can be
solved by the enhanced implementation of Pool Adjacent Violators Algorithm
(PAVA). Extensive numerical results demonstrate {the} superior performance of
the proposed approach over some state-of-the-art solvers.

designed to deliver diffraction limited imaging and 50 micro arcsecond
(${\mu}$as) astrometric accuracy. MICADO employs an atmospheric dispersion
corrector (ADC) to keep the chromatic elongation of the point spread function
(PSF) under control. We must understand the dispersion and residuals after
correction to reach the optimum performance. Therefore, we identified several
sources of chromatic dispersion that need to be considered for the MICADO ADC.
First, we compared common models of atmospheric dispersion to investigate
whether these models remain suitable for MICADO. We showed that the
differential dispersion between common atmospheric models and integration over
the full atmosphere is less than 10 ${\mu}$as for most observations in H-band.
We then performed an error propagation analysis to understand the uncertainty
in the atmospheric dispersion as a function of atmospheric conditions. In
addition, we investigated the impact of photometric color on the astrometric
performance. While the differential refraction between stars within the same
field of view can be significant, the inclusion of an ADC rendered this effect
negligible. For MICADO specifically, we found that the current optomechanical
design dominates the residual dispersion budget of 0.4 milli arcseconds (mas),
with a contribution of 0.31 mas due to the positioning accuracy of the prisms
and up to 0.15 mas due to a mismatch between the dispersive properties of the
glass and the atmosphere. We found no showstoppers in the design of the MICADO
ADC for achieving 50 ${\mu}$as relative astrometric accuracy.

the overall server system. Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) devices, such as Phase
Change Memory and Spin-Transfer Torque RAM, are suitable candidates for main

higher than DRAM and NVM writes are more energy sensitive than DRAM write

been proposed to reduce the overall energy depletion of main memory while
optimizing the performance of NVM. This paper proposes eMap, an optimal heap
memory object placement planner in HMMS. eMap considers the object-level access
patterns and energy consumption at the application level and provides an ideal
placement strategy for each object to augment performance and energy
utilization. eMap is equipped with two modules, eMPlan and eMDyn. Specifically,
eMPlan is a static placement planner which provides one time placement policies
for memory object to meet the energy budget while eMDyn is a runtime placement
planner to consider the change in energy limiting constraint during the runtime
and shuffles the memory objects by taking into account the access patterns as
well as the migration cost in terms of energy and performance. The evaluation
shows that our proposed solution satisfies both the energy limiting constraint
and the performance. We compare our methodology with the state-of-the-art
memory object classification and allocation (MOCA) framework. Our extensive
evaluation shows that our proposed solution, eMPlan meets the energy constraint
with 4.17 times less costly and reducing the energy consumption up to 14% with

optimal noise to stochastically perturb a given sample, such that it helps
lower the error on diverse adversarial perturbations. By utilizing samples

environment where mistakes can be very costly. In such settings, the agent
needs to behave safely not only after but also while learning. To achieve this,
existing safe reinforcement learning methods make an agent rely on priors that
let it avoid dangerous situations during exploration with high probability, but
both the probabilistic guarantees and the smoothness assumptions inherent in
the priors are not viable in many scenarios of interest such as autonomous
driving. This paper presents an alternative approach inspired by human
teaching, where an agent learns under the supervision of an automatic
instructor that saves the agent from violating constraints during learning. In
this model, we introduce the monitor that neither needs to know how to do well
at the task the agent is learning nor needs to know how the environment works.
Instead, it has a library of reset controllers that it activates when the agent
starts behaving dangerously, preventing it from doing damage. Crucially, the
choices of which reset controller to apply in which situation affect the speed
of agent learning. Based on observing agents' progress, the teacher itself
learns a policy for choosing the reset controllers, a curriculum, to optimize
the agent's final policy reward. Our experiments use this framework in two
environments to induce curricula for safe and efficient learning.

generation (3G) ground-based detectors such as the Cosmic Explorer (CE) and

astronomy could be a reality in about a decade. In this paper we present the
potential of multiband observations of intermediate mass binary black holes
(IMBBHs) of component masses ${\sim}10^2$-$10^3\,M_{\odot}$ to test general
relativity (GR). We show that mutiband observations of IMBBHs would permit
multiparameter tests of GR-tests where more than one post-Newtonian (PN)
coefficient is simultaneously measured yielding more rigorous constraints on
possible modifications to GR. We also find that the improvement due to
multibanding can often be much larger than the best of the bounds from either
of the two observatories. The origin of this result, as we shall demonstrate,
can be traced to the lifting of degeneracies among the various parameters when
the information from LISA and 3G are taken together. We obtain the best
multiband bounds for an IMBBH with a total redshifted mass of $200\,M_{\odot}$
and a mass ratio of 2. For single-parameter tests, this system at 1 Gpc would
allow us to constrain the deviations on all the PN coefficients to below $10\%$

to more resource-limited devices, there has been a recent surge of interest in
network pruning methods, which aim to remove less important weights or
activations of a given network. A common limitation of most existing pruning
techniques, is that they require pre-training of the network at least once
before pruning, and thus we can benefit from reduction in memory and
computation only at the inference time. However, reducing the training cost of
neural networks with rapid structural pruning may be beneficial either to
minimize monetary cost with cloud computing or to enable on-device learning on
a resource-limited device. Recently introduced random-weight pruning approaches
can eliminate the needs of pretraining, but they often obtain suboptimal
performance over conventional pruning techniques and also does not allow for
faster training since they perform unstructured pruning. To overcome their
limitations, we propose Set-based Task-Adaptive Meta Pruning (STAMP), which
task-adaptively prunes a network pretrained on a large reference dataset by
generating a pruning mask on it as a function of the target dataset. To ensure
maximum performance improvements on the target task, we meta-learn the mask
generator over different subsets of the reference dataset, such that it can
generalize well to any unseen datasets within a few gradient steps of training.
We validate STAMP against recent advanced pruning methods on benchmark
datasets, on which it not only obtains significantly improved compression rates

a smaller scatter in the FP ($\sim0.065$ dex; $\sim15\%$) than more compact
ones ($\sim0.10$ dex; $\sim23\%$). On the other hand, the scatter in the FP of
old ETGs does not depend on the compactness of galaxy structure. Thus, among
the subpopulations of ETGs, compact young ETGs have the largest scatter in the
FP. This large scatter in compact young ETGs is caused by ETGs that have low
dynamical mass-to-light ratio ($M_\mathrm{dyn}/L$) and blue color in the
central regions. By comparing with a simple model of the galaxy that has

access to multiple threads (or processes) to disjoint parts of a shared

gaining increasing interest in the Linux kernel community seeking to alleviate
bottlenecks in the virtual memory management subsystem. The existing
implementation of range locks in the kernel, however, uses an internal spin
lock to protect the underlying tree structure that keeps track of acquired and
requested ranges. This spin lock becomes a point of contention on its own when
the range lock is frequently acquired. Furthermore, where and exactly how
specific (refined) ranges can be locked remains an open question.
  In this paper, we make two independent, but related contributions. First, we
propose an alternative approach for building range locks based on linked lists.
The lists are easy to maintain in a lock-less fashion, and in fact, our range
locks do not use any internal locks in the common case. Second, we show how the
range of the lock can be refined in the mprotect operation through a
speculative mechanism. This refinement, in turn, allows concurrent execution of
mprotect operations on non-overlapping memory regions. We implement our new
algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness in user-space and kernel-space,
achieving up to 9$\times$ speedup compared to the stock version of the Linux
kernel. Beyond the virtual memory management subsystem, we discuss other
applications of range locks in parallel software. As a concrete example, we
show how range locks can be used to facilitate the design of scalable

honeycomb planes, which can be explained by considering the magnetic structures
of the parent compounds, MnPS$_3$ and FePS$_3$. We found that, on approaching
$T_g$ from above, an ensemble-averaged correlation length of $\xi = 5.5(6)$
\r{A} developed between satisfied correlations, and below $T_g$, the glassy
behaviour gave rise to a distance-independent correlation between unsatisfied
moments. Correlations between the planes were found to be very weak, which
mirrored our observations of rod-like structures parallel to the c* axis in our
single crystal diffraction measurements, confirming the two-dimensional nature
of Mn$_{0.5}$Fe$_{0.5}$PS$_3$.

generate diverse high-fidelity images. In particular, layout-to-image
generation models have gained significant attention due to their capability to
generate realistic complex images containing distinct objects. These models are
generally conditioned on either semantic layouts or textual descriptions.
However, unlike natural images, providing auxiliary information can be
extremely hard in domains such as biomedical imaging and remote sensing. In
this work, we propose a multi-object generation framework that can synthesize
images with multiple objects without explicitly requiring their contextual
information during the generation process. Based on a vector-quantized
variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) backbone, our model learns to preserve spatial
coherency within an image as well as semantic coherency between the objects and
the background through two powerful autoregressive priors: PixelSNAIL and
LayoutPixelSNAIL. While the PixelSNAIL learns the distribution of the latent
encodings of the VQ-VAE, the LayoutPixelSNAIL is used to specifically learn the
semantic distribution of the objects. An implicit advantage of our approach is
that the generated samples are accompanied by object-level annotations. We
demonstrate how coherency and fidelity are preserved with our method through
experiments on the Multi-MNIST and CLEVR datasets; thereby outperforming
state-of-the-art multi-object generative methods. The efficacy of our approach
is demonstrated through application on medical imaging datasets, where we show
that augmenting the training set with generated samples using our approach
improves the performance of existing models.

of the approach. The data-assimilation procedure, based on a variational
approach, consists in correcting a given baseline model by tuning
space-dependent source terms such that the corresponding solution matches
available measurements (obtained here from direct-numerical simulations). The
baseline model chosen here consists in Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS)
equations closed with the turbulence Spalart-Allmaras model. We investigate two
possible tuning functions: a source term in the momentum equations, which is
able to compensate for the deficiencies in the modeling of the Reynolds
stresses by the Boussinesq approximation and a source term in the turbulence
equation, which modifies the balance between the eddy-viscosity production and
dissipation. The quality of the mean-flow reconstruction strongly depends on
the baseline model and on the quantity of measurements. In the case of many
measurements, very accurate reconstructions of the mean-flow are obtained with
the model corrected by the source term in the momentum equations, while the
reconstruction is more approximate when tuning the source term in the
turbulence model. In the case of few measurements, this ""rigidity"" of the
corrected turbulence model is favourably used and allows the best mean-flow
reconstruction. The flexibility / rigidity of a model is further discussed in
the light of a singular-value decomposition of the linear input / output
operator between source term and measurements.

conformational statistics of collapsed unknotted polymer rings, which are known
to form compact hierarchical crumpled globules (CG) with $D_f=3$ at large

fractal path adjusted to the fractal dimension $D_f=3$ we tremendously simplify
the problem of generating compact self-avoiding conformations since we wash out
the topological constraints from the consideration. We make use of the
Monte-Carlo simulations to prepare the equilibrium ensemble of swollen chains
with various fractal dimensions. A combination of the Flory arguments with
statistical analysis of the conformations from simulations allows one to infer
the dependence of the critical exponent of the swollen chains on the fractal
dimension of the seed chain. We show that with the increase of $D_f$, typical
conformations become more territorial and less knotted. Distributions of the
knot complexity, $P(\chi)$ for various fractal dimensions of the swollen chains

the NOMA-aided BackCom networks in the context of outage probabilities and

strongly on the quality of the initial solutions. To overcome this difficulty,
self-adjusting and randomized heavy-tailed parameter choices can be profitable.
Finally, we observe a larger gap between the performance of the best

B=2$ transitions in five-dimensional Universal Extra Dimensional scenario where
masses and coupling strengths of several interactions of Kaluza-Klein modes are
significantly modified with respect to the minimal counterpart. In such
scenario we estimate the Kaluza-Klein contributions of quarks, gauge bosons and
charged Higgs by evaluating the one-loop box diagrams that are responsible for
the $\Delta B=2$ transitions. Using the loop function (obtained from one-loop
box diagrams) we determine several important elements that are involved in
Wolfenstein parametrisation. Moreover, with these elements we also study the
geometrical shape of unitarity triangle. Besides, we compute the quantity
$\Delta M_s$ scaled by the corresponding Standard Model value. Outcomes of our
theoretical predictions have been compared to the allowed ranges of the
corresponding observables simultaneously. Our current analysis shows that,
depending on the parameters in this scenario the lower limit on the inverse of
the radius of compactification can reach to an appreciable large value
($\approx 1.48$ TeV or even higher).

efficiently and transparently as possible, we designed a tool (ASReview) to
accelerate the step of screening titles and abstracts. For many tasks -

and practitioners screen thousands of studies by hand to determine which
studies to include in their review or meta-analysis. This is error prone and
inefficient because of extremely imbalanced data: only a fraction of the
screened studies is relevant. The future of systematic reviewing will be an
interaction with machine learning algorithms to deal with the enormous increase

intertwines the autoequivalences of the compact Fukaya category

closed-form for the probability density function characterized by only one
additional ``inflation'' parameter, with respect to the nested MN, governing
the tail-weight. The first four moments are also computed; interestingly, they
always exist and the excess kurtosis can assume any positive value. The method
of moments and maximum likelihood (ML) are considered for estimation. As
concerns the latter, a direct approach, as well as a variant of the EM
algorithm, are illustrated. The existence of the ML estimates is also
evaluated. Since the inflation parameter is estimated from the data, robust
estimates of the mean vector and covariance matrix of the nested MN
distribution are automatically obtained by down-weighting. Simulations are
performed to compare the estimation methods/algorithms and to investigate the
ability of AIC and BIC to select among a set of candidate elliptical models.

around 94 million tweets that posted by around 183 thousand users located at
different LGAs in NSW in five months, we found that people in NSW showed an
overall positive sentimental polarity and the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the
overall positive sentimental polarity during the pandemic period. The
fine-grained analysis of sentiment in LGAs found that despite the dominant
positive sentiment most of days during the study period, some LGAs experienced
significant sentiment changes from positive to negative. This study also
analysed the sentimental dynamics delivered by the hot topics in Twitter such
as government policies (e.g. the Australia's JobKeeper program, lockdown,
social-distancing) as well as the focused social events (e.g. the Ruby Princess
Cruise). The results showed that the policies and events did affect people's
overall sentiment, and they affected people's overall sentiment differently at
different stages.

infinite words. Sturmian words and Rote complementary symmetric sequences form
two classes of binary rich words, while episturmian words and words coding
symmetric $d$-interval exchange transformations give us other examples on

allow us to construct new rich words from already known rich words. We focus on
morphisms in Class $P_{ret}$. This class contains morphisms injective on the
alphabet and satisfying a particular palindromicity property: for every
morphism $\varphi$ in the class there exists a palindrome $w$ such that
$\varphi(a)w$ is a first complete return word to $w$ for each letter $a$. We
characterize $P_{ret}$ morphisms which preserve richness over a binary

high recognition accuracy is required, while 2) labeled samples are lacked. To

specific target domain (with only some or a few real labeled samples). This is
done by simultaneously learning each character's feature representation with an

character-level confusion between the source domain and the target domain, thus
achieves the sequence-level adaptation with even a small number of labeled

that our method significantly outperforms the finetuning scheme, and obtains
comparable performance to the state-of-the-art STR methods.

high energy bound on the relative entropy using known bounds on the elastic
differential cross-sections in massive QFTs. In $\chi PT$, relative entropy
close to threshold has simple expressions in terms of ratios of scattering
lengths. Definite sign properties are found for the relative entropy which are
over and above the usual positivity of relative entropy in certain cases. We
then turn to the recent numerical investigations of the S-matrix bootstrap in
the context of pion scattering. By imposing these sign constraints and the
$\rho$ resonance, we find restrictions on the allowed S-matrices. By performing
hypothesis testing using relative entropy, we isolate two sets of S-matrices
living on the boundary which give scattering lengths comparable to experiments

preliminary analysis to constrain the allowed space further, using ideas

of particles, inline obstacles), we investigated the validity of the
assumptions of the Newtonian fluid behavior for pseudoplastic fluids and the
circular particle shape for different-shaped particles (DSPs) in the context of
microfluidics-facilitated shape-based segregation of particles. Simulations
with a single DSP revealed that even in the absence of internal geometric
complexities of a microfluidics channel, the aforementioned assumptions led to
0.11-0.21W (W is the channel length) errors in lateral displacements of DSPs,
up to 3-20% errors in their velocities, and 3-5% errors in their travel times.
When these assumptions were applied in simulations involving multiple DSPs in
inertial microfluidics with inline obstacles, errors in the lateral
displacements of DSPs were as high as 0.78W and in their travel times up to
23%, which led to different (un)symmetric flow and segregation patterns of
DSPs. Thus, the fluid type and particle shape should be included in numerical
models and experiments to assess the performance of microfluidics for targeted

media. This research characterizes risk communication patterns by analyzing the
public discourse on the novel coronavirus from four Asian countries: South
Korea, Iran, Vietnam, and India, which suffered the outbreak to different
degrees. The temporal analysis shows that the official epidemic phases issued
by governments do not match well with the online attention on COVID-19. This
finding calls for a need to analyze the public discourse by new measures, such
as topical dynamics. Here, we propose an automatic method to detect topical
phase transitions and compare similarities in major topics across these
countries over time. We examine the time lag difference between social media
attention and confirmed patient counts. For dynamics, we find an inverse
relationship between the tweet count and topical diversity.

transmission is fundamentally hindered by the channel loss. Quantum repeaters
allow, in principle, to overcome these limitations, but their introduction
necessarily adds an additional layer of complexity to the distribution of
entanglement. This additional complexity - along with the stochastic nature of
processes such as entanglement generation, Bell swaps, and entanglement
distillation - makes finding good quantum repeater schemes non-trivial. We
develop an algorithm that can efficiently perform a heuristic optimisation over
a subset of quantum repeater schemes for general repeater platforms. We find a
strong improvement in the generation rate in comparison to an optimisation over
a simpler class of repeater schemes based on BDCZ repeater schemes. We use the
algorithm to study three different experimental quantum repeater
implementations on their ability to distribute entanglement, which we dub
\emph{information processing} implementations, \emph{multiplexed}
implementations, and combinations of the two. We perform this heuristic
optimisation of repeater schemes for each of these implementations for a wide
range of parameters and different experimental settings. This allows us to make
estimates on what are the most critical parameters to improve for entanglement
generation, how many repeaters to use, and which implementations perform best
in their ability to generate entanglement.

subsets of entities contained in a dataset and to reveal non-trivial
associations between different subsets of attributes, called views. This
interesting and challenging task is encountered in different scientific fields,
and is addressed by a number of approaches that obtain redescriptions and allow
for the exploration and analyses of attribute associations. The main limitation
of existing approaches to this task is their inability to use more than two
views. Our work alleviates this drawback. We present a memory efficient,
extensible multi-view redescription mining framework that can be used to relate
multiple, i.e. more than two views, disjoint sets of attributes describing one
set of entities. The framework can use any multi-target regression or
multi-label classification algorithm, with models that can be represented as
sets of rules, to generate redescriptions. Multi-view redescriptions are built
using incremental view-extending heuristic from initially created two-view
redescriptions. In this work, we use different types of Predictive Clustering
trees algorithms (regular, extra, with random output selection) and the Random
Forest thereof in order to improve the quality of final redescription sets
and/or execution time needed to generate them. We provide multiple performance
analyses of the proposed framework and compare it against the naive approach to
multi-view redescription mining. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed
multi-view extension on several datasets, including a use-case on understanding
of machine learning models - a topic of growing importance in machine learning

in approximation power when the variation of $\omega_f(r)$ as $r\to 0$ is

$H^\pm_{1,2}$. First, we determine the perturbative unitarity constraints and a
set of non trivial conditions for the boundedness from below (BFB). Then we
derive the Veltman conditions by considering the quadratic divergencies of
Higgs boson self energies in $2\mathcal{HDM+T}$. We find that the parameter

experimental exclusion limits and Higgs signal rate measurements at LEP and

consistency with theoretical constraints and current LHC data, essentially on

global coverage with short propagation delays when compared to satellites

satellites makes inter-satellite routing a complex and dynamic problem. In this
paper, we investigate the limits of unipath routing in a scenario where ground
stations (GSs) communicate with each other through a LEO constellation. For
this, we present a lightweight and topology-aware routing metric that favors
the selection of paths with high data rate inter-satellite links (ISLs).
Furthermore, we analyze the overall routing latency in terms of propagation,
transmission, and queueing times and calculate the maximum traffic load that
can be supported by the constellation. In our setup, the traffic is injected by
a network of GSs with real locations and is routed through adaptive multi-rate
inter-satellite links (ISLs). Our results illustrate the benefits of exploiting
the network topology, as the proposed metric can support up to 53% more traffic
when compared to the selected benchmarks, and consistently achieves the
shortest queueing times at the satellites and, ultimately, the shortest
end-to-end latency.

neural networks has been attracting increasing attention in the past few years.
Mainstream works (e.g. 3D-R2N2) use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to
sequentially fuse feature maps of input images. However, RNN-based approaches
are unable to produce consistent reconstruction results when given the same
input images with different orders. Moreover, RNNs may forget important
features from early input images due to long-term memory loss. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework for single-view and multi-view 3D object
reconstruction, named Pix2Vox++. By using a well-designed encoder-decoder, it
generates a coarse 3D volume from each input image. A multi-scale context-aware
fusion module is then introduced to adaptively select high-quality
reconstructions for different parts from all coarse 3D volumes to obtain a
fused 3D volume. To further correct the wrongly recovered parts in the fused 3D
volume, a refiner is adopted to generate the final output. Experimental results
on the ShapeNet, Pix3D, and Things3D benchmarks show that Pix2Vox++ performs
favorably against state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and
efficiency.

neural coding in biological neural networks. Yet, most neural activation
functions used in artificial networks are fixed and mostly considered as an
inconsequential architecture choice. In this paper, we investigate nonlinear
activation function adaptation over the large time scale of learning, and
outline its impact on sequential processing in recurrent neural networks. We
introduce a novel parametric family of nonlinear activation functions, inspired
by input-frequency response curves of biological neurons, which allows
interpolation between well-known activation functions such as ReLU and sigmoid.
Using simple numerical experiments and tools from dynamical systems and
information theory, we study the role of neural activation features in learning
dynamics. We find that activation adaptation provides distinct task-specific
solutions and in some cases, improves both learning speed and performance.
Importantly, we find that optimal activation features emerging from our
parametric family are considerably different from typical functions used in the
literature, suggesting that exploiting the gap between these usual
configurations can help learning. Finally, we outline situations where neural
activation adaptation alone may help mitigate changes in input statistics in a
given task, suggesting mechanisms for transfer learning optimization.

brightest point sources that are usually properly resolved and can be
subtracted or masked. We present results of analysis of the distribution of
point sources using UV sky-survey maps from the SOHO/SWAN instrument and
spectrophotometry data from the IUE satellite. The estimated distribution
suggests that the number of these sources increases with decreasing intensity.
Below a certain threshold, these sources cannot be resolved against the diffuse
signal from the backscatter glow, that results in a certain physical background
from unresolved point sources.
  Detection, understanding and subtraction of the point-source background has
implications for proper characterization of diffuse emissions and accurate
comparison with models. Stars are also often used as standard candles for
in-flight calibration of satellite UV observations, thus proper understanding
of signal contributions from the point sources is important for the calibration
process. We present a general approach to quantify the background radiation
level from unresolved point sources in UV sky-survey maps. In the proposed
method, a distribution of point sources as a function of their intensity is
properly integrated to compute the background signal level. These general
considerations are applied to estimate the unresolved-point-sources background
in the SOHO/SWAN observations that on average amounts to $28.9$ R. We discuss

strategy that permanently lowered the price of numerous store brands in several
product categories. To quantify the impact of such a policy change, researchers
often use synthetic control methods for estimating causal effects when a subset
of units receive a single persistent treatment, and the rest are unaffected by
the change. In our applications, however, competitor brands not assigned to
treatment are likely impacted by the intervention because of substitution
effects; more broadly, this type of interference occurs whenever the treatment
assignment of one unit affects the outcome of another. This paper extends the
synthetic control methods to accommodate partial interference, allowing
interference within predefined groups but not between them. Focusing on a class
of causal estimands that capture the effect both on the treated and control
units, we develop a multivariate Bayesian structural time series model for
generating synthetic controls that would have occurred in the absence of an
intervention enabling us to estimate our novel effects. In a simulation study,
we explore our Bayesian procedure's empirical properties and show that it
achieves good frequentists coverage even when the model is misspecified. We use
our new methodology to make causal statements about the impact on sales of the
affected store brands and their direct competitors. Our proposed approach is

the boundary remains an open problem. Here, we show that in the interior we
have Sobolev regularity for the stress and hardening while for their time
derivatives we have the ""half"" derivative with the spatial and time variable.
This was well known for the limiting problem but we show that these estimates
are uniform and independent of the order of approximation. The main novelty
consist of estimates near the boundary. We show that for the stress and the
hardening parameter, we control tangential derivative in the Lebesgue
space~$L^2$, and for time derivative of the stress and the hardening we control
the ""half"" time derivative and also spatial tangential derivative. Last, for
the normal derivative, we show that the stress and the hardening have the $3/5$

normal direction, provided we consider the kinematic hardening or near the
Dirichlet boundary. These estimates are independent of dimension. In case, we
consider the isotropic hardening near the Neumann boundary we shall obtain
$W^{\alpha,2}$ regularity for the stress and the hardening with some
$\alpha>1/2$ depending on the dimension and $W^{\beta,2}$ with some $\beta >

receiving continuous attention in recent years. An urgent task for us is to
understand the cascading failure vulnerability of power grids against various
kinds of attacks. We consider a cost restrained hybrid attack problem in power
grids, in which both nodes and links are targeted with a limited total attack
cost. We propose an attack centrality metric for a component (node or link)
based on the consequence and cost of the removal of the component. Depending on
the width of cascading failures considered, the attack centrality can be a
local or global attack centrality. With the attack centrality, we further
provide a greedy hybrid attack, and an optimal hybrid attack with the Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) framework. Simulation results on IEEE bus test data
show that the optimal hybrid attack is more efficient than the greedy hybrid
attack. Furthermore, we find counterintuitively that the local centrality based
algorithms are better than the global centrality based ones when the cost
constraint is considered in the attack problem.

high-resolution (a.k.a. event-based) traffic data. This is the raw data
obtained from fixed sensors in urban roads. Time series of such raw data
exhibit heavy fluctuations from one time step to the next (typically on the
order of 0.1-1 second). Short-term forecasts (10-30 seconds into the future) of
traffic conditions are critical for traffic operations applications (e.g.,
adaptive signal control). But traffic forecasting tools in the literature deal
predominantly with 3-5 minute aggregated data, where the typical signal cycle
is on the order of 2 minutes. This renders such forecasts useless at the
operations level. To this end, we model the traffic forecasting problem as a
matrix completion problem, where the forecasting inputs are mapped to a higher
dimensional space using kernels. The formulation allows us to capture both
nonlinear dependencies between forecasting inputs and outputs but also allows
us to capture dependencies among the inputs. These dependencies correspond to
correlations between different locations in the network. We further employ
adaptive boosting to enhance the training accuracy and capture historical
patterns in the data. The performance of the proposed methods is verified using
high-resolution data obtained from a real-world traffic network in Abu Dhabi,
UAE. Our experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms other
state-of-the-art algorithms.

OT, which seeks to maximize the OT cost between two measures by choosing a

contribution is to establish several fundamental statistical properties of PR
Wasserstein distances, complementing and improving previous literature that has
been restricted to one-dimensional and well-specified cases. Next, we propose
the integral PR Wasserstein (IPRW) distance as an alternative to the PRW
distance, by averaging rather than optimizing on subspaces. Our complexity
bounds can help explain why both PRW and IPRW distances outperform Wasserstein
distances empirically in high-dimensional inference tasks. Finally, we consider
parametric inference using the PRW distance. We provide an asymptotic guarantee
of two types of minimum PRW estimators and formulate a central limit theorem
for max-sliced Wasserstein estimator under model misspecification. To enable
our analysis on PRW with projection dimension larger than one, we devise a
novel combination of variational analysis and statistical theory.

dielectric layers, then remove layers from individual optics as needed. Here we
present a low-cost, single-step, monitored wet etch technique for reliably
removing (or partially removing) individual SiO$_2$ and Ta$_2$O$_5$ dielectric
layers, in this case from a high-reflectivity fiber mirror. By immersing in
acid and monitoring off-band reflected light, we show it is straightforward to
iteratively (or continuously) remove six bilayers. At each stage, we
characterize the coating performance with a Fabry-P\'{e}rot cavity, observing
the expected stepwise decrease in finesse from 92,000$\pm$3,000 to
3,950$\pm$50, finding no evidence of added optical losses. The etch also
removes the fiber's sidewall coating after a single bilayer, and, after six
bilayers, confines the remaining coating to a $\sim$50-$\mu$m-diameter pedestal
at the center of the fiber tip. Vapor etching above the solution produces a
tapered ""pool cue"" cladding profile, reducing the fiber diameter (nominally 125
$\mu$m) to $\sim$100 $\mu$m at an angle of $\sim$0.3$^\circ$ near the tip.
Finally, we note that the data generated by this technique provides a sensitive
estimate of the layers' optical depths. This technique could be readily adapted
to free-space optics and other coatings.

consensus, wallet, and networking overlay. The aim of the consensus part is to
bring trustless rational peer-to-peer nodes to an agreement to the current
status of the blockchain. The status must be updated through valid
transactions. A proof-of-work (PoW) based consensus mechanism has been proven
to be secure and robust owing to its simple rule and has served as a firm
foundation for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Specialized
mining devices have emerged, as rational miners aim to maximize profit, and
caused two problems: i) the re-centralization of a mining market and ii) the
huge energy spending in mining. In this paper, we aim to propose a new PoW
called Error-Correction Codes PoW (ECCPoW) where the error-correction codes and
their decoder can be utilized for PoW. In ECCPoW, puzzles can be intentionally
generated to vary from block to block, leading to a time-variant puzzle
generation mechanism. This mechanism is useful in repressing the emergence of
the specialized mining devices. It can serve as a solution to the two problems
of recentralization and energy spending.

reinforcement learning (DRL) achieves tremendous empirical successes. However,
learning expressive function approximators requires collecting a large dataset
(interventional data) by interacting with the environment. Such a lack of
sample efficiency prohibits the application of DRL to critical scenarios, e.g.,
autonomous driving and personalized medicine, since trial and error in the
online setting is often unsafe and even unethical. In this paper, we study how
to incorporate the dataset (observational data) collected offline, which is
often abundantly available in practice, to improve the sample efficiency in the
online setting. To incorporate the possibly confounded observational data, we
propose the deconfounded optimistic value iteration (DOVI) algorithm, which
incorporates the confounded observational data in a provably efficient manner.
More specifically, DOVI explicitly adjusts for the confounding bias in the
observational data, where the confounders are partially observed or unobserved.
In both cases, such adjustments allow us to construct the bonus based on a
notion of information gain, which takes into account the amount of information
acquired from the offline setting. In particular, we prove that the regret of
DOVI is smaller than the optimal regret achievable in the pure online setting
by a multiplicative factor, which decreases towards zero when the confounded
observational data are more informative upon the adjustments. Our algorithm and
analysis serve as a step towards causal reinforcement learning.

intelligent adversaries. This paper deals with the detection of APTs that
infiltrate cyber systems and compromise specifically targeted data and/or
infrastructures. Dynamic information flow tracking is an information
trace-based detection mechanism against APTs that taints suspicious information
flows in the system and generates security analysis for unauthorized use of
tainted data. In this paper, we develop an analytical model for
resource-efficient detection of APTs using an information flow tracking game.
The game is a nonzero-sum, turn-based, stochastic game with asymmetric
information as the defender cannot distinguish whether an incoming flow is
malicious or benign and hence has only partial state observation. We analyze
equilibrium of the game and prove that a Nash equilibrium is given by a
solution to the minimum capacity cut set problem on a flow-network derived from
the system, where the edge capacities are obtained from the cost of performing
security analysis. Finally, we implement our algorithm on the real-world
dataset for a data exfiltration attack augmented with false-negative and
false-positive rates and compute an optimal defender strategy.

nodes appears in many forms across machine learning. We study a version of this
problem that arises in the field of \emph{landscape genetics}, where genetic
similarity between organisms living in a heterogeneous landscape is explained
by a weighted graph that encodes the ease of dispersal through that landscape.
Our main contribution is an efficient algorithm for \emph{inverse landscape
genetics}, which is the task of inferring this graph from measurements of
genetic similarity at different locations (graph nodes). Inverse landscape
genetics is important in discovering impediments to species dispersal that
threaten biodiversity and long-term species survival. In particular, it is
widely used to study the effects of climate change and human development.
Drawing on influential work that models organism dispersal using graph
\emph{effective resistances} (McRae 2006), we reduce the inverse landscape
genetics problem to that of inferring graph edges from noisy measurements of
these resistances, which can be obtained from genetic similarity data. Building
on the NeurIPS 2018 work of Hoskins et al. 2018 on learning edges in social
networks, we develop an efficient first-order optimization method for solving
this problem. Despite its non-convex nature, experiments on synthetic and real
genetic data establish that our method provides fast and reliable convergence,
significantly outperforming existing heuristics used in the field. By providing
researchers with a powerful, general purpose algorithmic tool, we hope our work
will have a positive impact on accelerating work on landscape genetics.

  Multimodal Posteriors","minor revision",,,,"stat.ME stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  When working with multimodal Bayesian posterior distributions, Markov chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms have difficulty moving between modes, and default
variational or mode-based approximate inferences will understate posterior
uncertainty. And, even if the most important modes can be found, it is
difficult to evaluate their relative weights in the posterior. Here we propose
an approach using parallel runs of MCMC, variational, or mode-based inference
to hit as many modes or separated regions as possible and then combine these
using Bayesian stacking, a scalable method for constructing a weighted average
of distributions. The result from stacking efficiently samples from multimodal
posterior distribution, minimizes cross validation prediction error, and
represents the posterior uncertainty better than variational inference, but it
is not necessarily equivalent, even asymptotically, to fully Bayesian
inference. We present theoretical consistency with an example where the stacked
inference approximates the true data generating process from the misspecified
model and a non-mixing sampler, from which the predictive performance is better
than full Bayesian inference, hence the multimodality can be considered a
blessing rather than a curse under model misspecification. We demonstrate
practical implementation in several model families: latent Dirichlet
allocation, Gaussian process regression, hierarchical regression, horseshoe
variable selection, and neural networks.

dark photon explains the current DM abundance. We recently proposed a model
where the main component DM today is a decaying warm dark matter (WDM) with the
life time comparable to the age of the current universe. The WDM decays to a
massless fermion and a massive dark photon. This model was originally designed
for addressing both the small scale problems which $\Lambda$CDM suffers from
and the $H_{0}$ tension. In this letter, we show that the massive dark photon
produced by the WDM decay can be identified with the vector boson inducing the
anomalous excess in the XENON1T experiment. Depending on a lifetime of the
parent decaying WDM, the dark photon could be either the main component or the
sub-component of DM population today.

general expression for the conductivity tensor through the correlation
functions of the homogeneous electron gas is derived. The quantum transport
regime, when Landau quantization is essential, is studied for the case of
unidirectional periodic potential modulation. Apart from the Shubnikov-de Haas
oscillations, the resistivity can demonstrate quantum oscillations with larger
periods and smaller amplitudes, which survive when temperature increases. These
oscillations exist when the modulation amplitude considerably exceeds the
cyclotron energy so the Landau subbands, formed out of the Landau levels by the
modulation potential, overlap in the energy domain. Both diagonal components of
the resistivity tensor demonstrate oscillations related to modification of the
density of states by the modulation. In addition, the resistivity component
perpendicular to the modulation axis, which is caused by the
scattering-assisted hopping transport, shows another kind of oscillations
related to enhancement of the hopping probability when the guiding center of
cyclotron orbit shifts by the doubled cyclotron radius. It is suggested that
such high-temperature oscillations can be detected under conditions when the
modulation period considerably exceeds the cyclotron radius.

planetary interiors is a very challenging task. In addition to the uncertainty
in the observed fundamental parameters, theoretical models are limited due to
the degeneracy in determining the planetary composition. We aim to study
several aspects that affect internal characterization of super-Earths and
sub-Neptunes: observational uncertainties, location on the M-R diagram, impact
of additional constraints as bulk abundances or irradiation, and model
assumptions. We use a full probabilistic Bayesian inference analysis that
accounts for observational and model uncertainties. We employ a Nested Sampling
scheme to efficiently produce the posterior probability distributions for all
the planetary structural parameter of interest. We include a structural model
based on self-consistent thermodynamics of core, mantle, high-pressure ice,
liquid water, and H-He envelope. Regarding the effect of mass and radius
uncertainties on the determination of the internal structure, we find three
different regimes: below the Earth-like composition line and above the
pure-water composition line smaller observational uncertainties lead to better
determination of the core and atmosphere mass respectively, and between them
structure characterization only weakly depends on the observational
uncertainties. We show that small variations in the temperature or entropy
profiles lead to radius variations that are comparable to the observational
uncertainty, suggesting that uncertainties linked to model assumptions can
become more relevant to determine the internal structure than observational

$G=SL(r,\mathbb{C})$, $PGL(r, \mathbb{C})$, $Sp(2r,\mathbb{C})$,
$GSp(2r,\mathbb{C})$, $PSp(2r,\mathbb{C})$, over any fiber.
  In the first chapter we introduce the compactified Jacobian stack
parametrizing torsion-free rank-1 sheaves over a (possibly reducible, non
reduced) projective curve and we describe the spectral correspondence for Higgs
pairs in terms of the compactified Jacobian.
  In the second chapter, we study the notion of direct and inverse image for
generalized divisors and generalized line bundles associated to any finite,
flat morphism between embeddable noetherian schemes of pure dimension 1. In the
case when we deal with projective curves over a field, we study the Norm and
inverse image maps between compactified Jacobians.
  In the third chapter we introduce the Prym stack associated to any finite,
flat morphism between projective curves over a field, with smooth codomain. If
the domain is reduced with locally planar singularities and the field is
algebraically closed, we show that the usual Prym scheme is contained in the
Prym stack as an open and dense subset.
  In the fourth chapter, we study the fibers of the $G$-Hitchin fibration, for
$G$ varying among classical Lie groups. In particular, in the case of
$G=SL(r,\mathbb{C})$, $PGL(r, \mathbb{C})$, the description of any fiber
involves the stacky fibers of the Norm map induced by the morphism from the
spectral curve to the base curve. In the case of $G=Sp(2r,\mathbb{C})$,
$GSp(2r,\mathbb{C})$, $PSp(2r,\mathbb{C})$, the description of any fiber
involves the equalizer stack of two maps defined on the compactified Jacobian
of the spectral curve.

devices connected to a central parameter server (PS) and iteratively
download/upload data from/to the PS. Due to the limited bandwidth, only a
subset of connected devices can be scheduled in each round. There are usually
millions of parameters in the state-of-art machine learning models such as deep

communication burden on collecting/distributing data for training. To improve
communication efficiency and make the training model converge faster, we
propose a new scheduling policy and power allocation scheme using
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) settings to maximize the weighted sum
data rate under practical constraints during the entire learning process. NOMA
allows multiple users to transmit on the same channel simultaneously. The user

analyse in detail the near-wall layer microstructure. Whereas global porosity
of this layer does not seem to be affected by ionic strength and applied
pressure drop, a local study shows some heterogeneity: clogs are more porous at
the vicinity of the pore than far away. An analysis of medium-range order using
radial distribution function shows a slightly more organized state at high
ionic strength. This is confirmed by a local analysis using two-dimension

representation of quantum dynamics preserves the tensor product structure,
which makes it favourable for the analysis of multi-qubit systems. A key
advantage of the suggested approach is that minimal informationally complete
positive operator-valued measures (MIC-POVMs) are easier to construct in
comparison with their symmetric versions (SIC-POVMs). We establish a
correspondence between the standard quantum-mechanical formalism and the
MIC-POVM-based probability formalism. Within the latter approach, we derive
equations for the unitary von-Neumann evolution and the Markovian dissipative
evolution, which is governed by the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad
(GKSL) generator. We apply the MIC-POVM-based probability representation to the
digital quantum computing model. In particular, for the case of spin-$1/2$
evolution, we demonstrate identifying a transition of a dissipative quantum
dynamics to a completely classical-like stochastic dynamics. One of the most
important findings is that the MIC-POVM-based probability representation gives
more strict requirements for revealing the non-classical character of
dissipative quantum dynamics in comparison with the SIC-POVM-based approach.
Our results give a physical interpretation of quantum computations and pave a
way for exploring the resources of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)

generally thought in a quantum limit to be gravitons. The stretched horizon of
a black hole contains quantum information, or a form of quantum hair, which in
a coalescence of black holes participates in the generation of gravitons. This
may be facilitated with a Bohr-like approach to black hole (BH) quantum physics
with quasi-normal mode (QNM) approach to BH quantum mechanics. Quantum gravity
and quantum hair on event horizons is excited to higher energy in BH
coalescence. The near horizon condition for two BHs right before collision is a
deformed AdS spacetime. These excited states of BH quantum hair then relax with
the production of gravitons. This is then argued to define RT entropy given by
quantum hair on the horizons. These qubits of information from a BH coalescence

standard AdS/CFT correspondence and the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula.

survival of companies in the market. Therefore, it is significant both from
theoretical and practical points of view to understand how governments can
influence technology growth and innovation diffusion (TGID) processes. We
propose a simple but essential extension of Ausloos-Clippe-P\c{e}kalski and
related Cichy numerical models of the TGID in the market. Both models are
inspired by the nonlinear non-equilibrium statistical physics. Our extension
involves a parameter describing the probability of government intervention in
the TGID process in the company market. We show, using Monte Carlo simulations,
the effects interventionism can have on the companies' market, depending on the
segment of firms that are supported. The high intervention probability can
result, paradoxically, in the destabilization of the market development. It
lowers the market's technology level in the long-time limit compared to markets
with a lower intervention parameter. We found that the intervention in the
technologically weak and strong segments of the company market does not
substantially influence the market dynamics, compared to the intervention
helping the middle-level companies. However, this is still a simple model which
can be extended further and made more realistic by including other factors.
Namely, the cost and risk of innovation or limited government resources and
capabilities to support companies.

"2007.06535","Shahzada Mushtaq Mr.","Shahzada Aamir Mushtaq, Wang Yuhui","The New Digital Platforms: Merger Control in Pakistan",,,,,"q-fin.GN econ.GN q-fin.EC","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  The Pakistan competition policy, as in many other countries, was originally
designed to regulate business conduct in traditional markets and for tangible
goods and services. However, the development and proliferation of the internet
has led to the emergence of digital companies which have disrupted many sectors
of the economy. These platforms provide digital infrastructure for a range of
services including search engines, marketplaces, and social networking sites.
The digital economy poses a myriad of challenges for competition authorities
worldwide, especially with regard to digital mergers and acquisitions (M&As).
While some jurisdictions such as the European Union and the United States have
taken significant strides in regulating technological M&As, there is an
increasing need for developing countries such as Pakistan to rethink their
competition policy tools. This paper investigates whether merger reviews in the
Pakistan digital market are informed by the same explanatory variables as in
the traditional market, by performing an empirical comparative analysis of the
Competition Commission of Pakistan's (CCP's) M&A decisions between 2014 and
2019. The findings indicate the CCP applies the same decision factors in
reviewing both traditional and digital M&As. As such, this paper establishes a
basis for igniting the policy and economic debate of regulating the digital
platform industry in Pakistan.

including areas of computer vision, text and speech processing. Enormous
research efforts have led to numerous methods that are capable of efficiently
analyzing data, especially in the Euclidean space. However, many problems are
posed in non-Euclidean domains modeled as general graphs with complex
connection patterns. Increased problem complexity and computational power
constraints have limited early approaches to static and small-sized graphs. In
recent years, a rising interest in machine learning on graph-structured data
has been accompanied by improved methods that overcome the limitations of their
predecessors. These methods paved the way for dealing with large-scale and
time-dynamic graphs. This work aims to provide an overview of early and modern
graph neural network based machine learning methods for node-level prediction
tasks. Under the umbrella of taxonomies already established in the literature,
we explain the core concepts and provide detailed explanations for
convolutional methods that have had strong impact. In addition, we introduce
common benchmarks and present selected applications from various areas.
Finally, we discuss open problems for further research.

fractional-order difference and accumulation, but in the actual modeling,
continuous fractional-order calculus has been proved to have many excellent

continuous fractional-order calculus method, and they have achieved good
results. However, the models are very complicated in the calculation and are
not conducive to the actual application. In order to further simplify and
improve the grey prediction models with continuous fractional-order derivative,
we propose a simple and effective grey model based on conformable fractional
derivatives in this paper, and two practical cases are used to demonstrate the
validity of the proposed model.
