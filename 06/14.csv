low-level flux. During its most recent optical outburst we obtained spectra
with the Southern Africa Large Telescope (SALT) where, for the first time, the
H-alpha line is seen in emission, confirming the Be nature of the optical
companion. The OGLE colour-magnitude diagrams also exhibit a distinct loop
which is explained by changes in mass-loss from the Be star and mass outflow in
its disc. In the X-rays, XMMU J010331.7-730144 has been monitored by the Neil

throughout the monitoring campaign shows relatively low values for a typical

the variability is due to the Be disc density and opacity changing rather than
its physical extent as a result of efficient truncation by the NS. The
relatively low X-ray flux can then be explained by the neutron star normally
accreting matter at a low rate due to the small radial extent of the Be disc.

implemented in practical architectures using group convolutions and block

of the proposed approach is to invalidate the knowledge that the attackers use
to mask the effects of their physical attack by actively perturbing the grid's
transmission line reactances via distributed flexible AC transmission system
(D-FACTS) devices. The proposed MTD design consists of two parts. First, we
identify the subset of links for D-FACTS device deployment that enables the
defender to detect CCPAs against any link in the system. Then, in order to
minimize the defense cost during the system's operational time, we formulate a
zero-sum game to identify the best subset of links to perturb (which will
provide adequate protection) against a strategic attacker. The Nash equilibrium
robust solution is computed via exponential weights, which does not require
complete knowledge of the game but only the observed payoff at each iteration.
Extensive simulations performed using the MATPOWER simulator on IEEE bus
systems verify the effectiveness of our approach in detecting CCPAs and
reducing the operator's defense cost.

for the first time to use hardware-supported approximate computing to improve
the robustness of machine learning classifiers. We show that our approximate
computing implementation achieves robustness across a wide range of attack
scenarios. Specifically, for black-box and grey-box attack scenarios, we show
that successful adversarial attacks against the exact classifier have poor
transferability to the approximate implementation. Surprisingly, the robustness
advantages also apply to white-box attacks where the attacker has access to the
internal implementation of the approximate classifier. We explain some of the
possible reasons for this robustness through analysis of the internal operation

maintains the same level in terms of classification accuracy, does not require

We conducted extensive experiments on a set of strong adversarial attacks; We

training procedures such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to find simple
models---to justify why neural networks generalize well [Arpit et al. 2017,
Nakkiran et al. 2019, Soudry et al. 2018]. However, the precise notion of
simplicity remains vague. Furthermore, previous settings that use SB to
theoretically justify why neural networks generalize well do not simultaneously
capture the non-robustness of neural networks---a widely observed phenomenon in
practice [Goodfellow et al. 2014, Jo and Bengio 2017]. We attempt to reconcile
SB and the superior standard generalization of neural networks with the
non-robustness observed in practice by designing datasets that (a) incorporate
a precise notion of simplicity, (b) comprise multiple predictive features with
varying levels of simplicity, and (c) capture the non-robustness of neural
networks trained on real data. Through theory and empirics on these datasets,
we make four observations: (i) SB of SGD and variants can be extreme: neural
networks can exclusively rely on the simplest feature and remain invariant to
all predictive complex features. (ii) The extreme aspect of SB could explain
why seemingly benign distribution shifts and small adversarial perturbations
significantly degrade model performance. (iii) Contrary to conventional wisdom,
SB can also hurt generalization on the same data distribution, as SB persists
even when the simplest feature has less predictive power than the more complex
features. (iv) Common approaches to improve generalization and
robustness---ensembles and adversarial training---can fail in mitigating SB and
its pitfalls. Given the role of SB in training neural networks, we hope that
the proposed datasets and methods serve as an effective testbed to evaluate
novel algorithmic approaches aimed at avoiding the pitfalls of SB.

Development of efficient techniques for surveying flavor evolution solution
spaces in these diverse environments, which augment and complement existing
sophisticated computational tools, could leverage progress in this field. To
this end we continue our exploration of statistical data assimilation (SDA) to
identify solutions to a small-scale model of neutrino flavor transformation.
SDA is a machine learning (ML) formula wherein a dynamical model is assumed to
generate any measured quantities. Specifically, we use an optimization
formulation of SDA wherein a cost function is extremized via the variational
method. Regions of state space in which the extremization identifies the global
minimum of the cost function will correspond to parameter regimes in which a
model solution can exist. Our example study seeks to infer the flavor
transformation histories of two mono-energetic neutrino beams coherently
interacting with each other and with a matter background. We require that the
solution be consistent with measured neutrino flavor fluxes at the point of
detection, and with constraints placed upon the flavor content at various
locations along their trajectories, such as the point of emission, and the
locations of the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonances. We show how the
procedure efficiently identifies solution regimes and rules out regimes where
solutions are infeasible. Overall, results intimate the promise of this

UAVs perform measurements quickly and semiautomatically, they can potentially
assist in near realtime adjustments of the network configuration and

well as help improve indoor connectivity while respecting outdoor emission
constraints. This article offers a firsthand tutorial on using aerial 5G

order to obtain and store this information. Furthermore, given the type of
study or the project the resolution analysis interval can vary from less than
one hour to annual. To create alternatives in database structures,this article
aims to present a method to reconstruct disaggregated historical data from
aggregated data using Wavelet Transform. From the proposed method, it is
possible to reconstruct data in short intervals from data with longer
intervals,since they have the same behavior, for example, data from the same or
similar highway. For such, a Detail coefficient is generated through the
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with the disaggregated data. The aggregated
data was reconstructed through an Approximation coefficient. After establishing
these coefficients, the Inverse Wavelet Transform (IWT) is applied. The results
indicated an average correlation between the reconstructed the original data of
0.960; 0.974; 0.968 and 0.960 for data initially aggregated at 10, 20, 40 and

low average absolute error rate, comparable to traffic estimation studies

However, the major drawback of this adaptation is the loss of spatial

able to operate with full spatial resolution, needs to subsample features for
large image sizes in order to make the training and inference tractable. In
this work, we introduce Split-Merge pooling to fully preserve the spatial

evaluate our approach for dense semantic segmentation of large image sizes

capability to determine whether measured relativistic electron pitch-angle and
energy spectra within the loss cone bear the characteristic signatures of
scattering by EMIC waves or whether such scattering may be due to other
processes. Pairing identical ELFIN satellites with slowly-variable along-track
separation allows disambiguation of spatial and temporal evolution of the
precipitation over minutes-to-tens-of-minutes timescales, faster than the orbit
period of a single low-altitude satellite (~90min). Each satellite carries an
energetic particle detector for electrons (EPDE) that measures 50keV to 5MeV
electrons with deltaE/E<40% and a fluxgate magnetometer (FGM) on a ~72cm boom
that measures magnetic field waves (e.g., EMIC waves) in the range from DC to
5Hz Nyquist (nominally) with <0.3nT/sqrt(Hz) noise at 1Hz. The spinning
satellites (T_spin~3s) are equipped with magnetorquers that permit spin-up/down
and reorientation maneuvers. The spin axis is placed normal to the orbit plane,
allowing full pitch-angle resolution twice per spin. An energetic particle
detector for ions (EPDI) measures 250keV-5MeV ions, addressing secondary
science. Funded initially by CalSpace and the University Nanosat Program, ELFIN
was selected for flight with joint support from NSF and NASA between 2014 and
2018.

was compressed to a small size before ``bouncing'' to form the present
expanding universe. William Lane Craig and James Sinclair have argued that the
orthodox interpretation is incorrect if the entropy reaches a minimum at the
bounce. In their view, the interface between universes represents the birth of
two expanding universes, i.e., a ``double bang'' instead of a ``big bounce''.
Here, I reply to Craig and Sinclair in defense of the orthodox interpretation.
Contrary to their interpretation, features of one universe explain features of
the other universe and so must precede the other universe in time. Moreover,
contrary to a crucial part of Craig and Sinclair's interpretation, there are
bounce cosmologies in which the thermodynamic arrow of time is continuous
through the bounce even though the entropy is ``reset'' at the bounce.

which in presence of an applied electric field, flows in different directions

  Approach",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CG cs.CR stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Adversarial machine learning has attracted a great amount of attention in
recent years. In a poisoning attack, the adversary can inject a small number of
specially crafted samples into the training data which make the decision
boundary severely deviate and cause unexpected misclassification. Due to the
great importance and popular use of support vector machines (SVM), we consider
defending SVM against poisoning attacks in this paper. We study two commonly
used strategies for defending: designing robust SVM algorithms and data
sanitization. Though several robust SVM algorithms have been proposed before,
most of them either are in lack of adversarial-resilience, or rely on strong
assumptions about the data distribution or the attacker's behavior. Moreover,
the research on their complexities is still quite limited. We are the first, to
the best of our knowledge, to prove that even the simplest hard-margin
one-class SVM with outliers problem is NP-complete, and has no fully PTAS
unless P$=$NP (that means it is hard to achieve an even approximate algorithm).
For the data sanitization defense, we link it to the intrinsic dimensionality
of data; in particular, we provide a sampling theorem in doubling metrics for
explaining the effectiveness of DBSCAN (as a density-based outlier removal
method) for defending against poisoning attacks. In our empirical experiments,
we compare several defenses including the DBSCAN and robust SVM methods, and
investigate the influences from the intrinsic dimensionality and data density

slip in both hydrophobic and hydrophilic pores, yet it also restricts the ALP

we investigate these edge effects and prove the following result. Suppose that
a one-dimensional infinite crystalline material hosting a positive energy
defect state is truncated a distance $M$ from the defect. Then, for
sufficiently large $M$, there exists a resonance \emph{exponentially close} (in

both the resonance frequency and associated resonant state to be computed to
all orders in $e^{-M}$. We expect this result to be of particular interest in
the context of photonic crystals, where defect states are used for wave-guiding

statistical mechanics. In this letter we generalize the high temperature virial
expansion approach to treat far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics. As an
application of our framework, we study the dynamics of a Bose gas quenched from
non-interacting to unitarity, and we compare our theoretical results with
unexplained experimental results by the Cambridge group [Eigen et al., Nature
563, 221 (2018)]. We show that, during the quench dynamics, the momentum
distribution decreases for low-momentum part with $k<k^*$, and increases for
high-momentum part with $k>k^*$, where $k^*$ is a characteristic momentum scale
separating the low- and the high-momentum regimes. We determine the universal
value of $k^*\lambda$ that agrees perfectly with the experiment, with $\lambda$
being the thermal de Broglie wave length. We also find a jump of the half-way
relaxation time across $k^*\lambda$ and the non-monotonic behavior of energy
distribution, both of which agree with the experiment. Finally, we address the
issue whether the long-time steady state thermalizes or not, and we find that
this state does thermalize except for the very high momentum tail with
$k\lambda\gg 1$. Our framework can also be applied to quench dynamics in other
systems.

of class distribution mismatch in semi-supervised deep learning (SSDL) with
MixMatch. This work is divided into two components: (i) an extensive out of
distribution (OOD) ablation test bed for SSDL and (ii) a quantitative
unlabelled dataset selection heuristic referred to as MixMOOD. In the first
part, we analyze the sensitivity of MixMatch accuracy under 90 different
distribution mismatch scenarios across three multi-class classification tasks.
These are designed to systematically understand how OOD unlabelled data affects
MixMatch performance. In the second part, we propose an efficient and effective
method, called deep dataset dissimilarity measures (DeDiMs), to compare
labelled and unlabelled datasets. The proposed DeDiMs are quick to evaluate and
model agnostic. They use the feature space of a generic Wide-ResNet and can be
applied prior to learning. Our test results reveal that supposed semantic
similarity between labelled and unlabelled data is not a good heuristic for
unlabelled data selection. In contrast, strong correlation between MixMatch
accuracy and the proposed DeDiMs allow us to quantitatively rank different
unlabelled datasets ante hoc according to expected MixMatch accuracy. This is
what we call MixMOOD. Furthermore, we argue that the MixMOOD approach can aid
to standardize the evaluation of different semi-supervised learning techniques
under real world scenarios involving out of distribution data.

CLTs, and test the theoretic findings on a stochastic parameter estimation

understanding of the simplest genetic circuit is sufficiently refined both

These different models are then invoked to confront a variety of different data

Maximum Mean Discrepancy between the conditional distributions of deep features
on the source and target domains, and extract the discriminant information from
target domain by maximizing the mutual information between samples and the
prediction labels. In addition, DCAN can be used to address a special scenario,
Partial unsupervised domain adaptation, where the target domain category is a

the optical systems that mobilize such functionality. The varifocal tools that
are the least burdensome to drive (ex: liquid crystal, elastomeric or

fastest devices sacrifice either critical capabilities such as their dwelling

or low operating overhead (e.g., deformable mirrors). Here, we present a
general-purpose random-access axial focusing device that bridges these
previously conflicting features of high speed, dwelling capacity and
lightweight drive by employing low-rigidity micromirrors that exploit the
robustness of defocusing phase profiles. Geometrically, the device consists of
an 8.2 mm diameter array of piston-motion and 48 um-pitch micromirror pixels
that provide 2pi phase shifting for wavelengths shorter than 1 100 nm with
10-90 % settling in 64.8 us (i.e., 15.44 kHz refresh rate). The pixels are
electrically partitioned into 32 rings for a driving scheme that enables
phase-wrapped operation with circular symmetry and requires less than 30 V per

a measured ability to target 29 distinct, resolvable depth planes. Overall, the

pose estimation using a single image as an input. We solve for the 6D object
pose of a known object relative to the camera using a single image with

exploited image keypoints extraction followed by PnP regression for pose
estimation. Instead of relying on bounding box or keypoints on the object, we
propose to learn orientation-induced primitive so as to achieve the pose
estimation accuracy regardless of the object size. We leverage a Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) to learn this underlying primitive and its associated
keypoints. The keypoints inferred from the reconstructed primitive image are
then used to regress the rotation using PnP. Lastly, we compute the translation
in a separate localization module to complete the entire 6D pose estimation.
When evaluated over public datasets, the proposed method yields a notable
improvement over the LINEMOD, the Occlusion LINEMOD, and the YCB-Video dataset.

number of system components with multi-disciplinary nature in the presence of
interacting design objectives. Currently, the sequential design is widely used
by designers in industries that deal with different domains and their
corresponding design objectives separately leading to a functional but not
necessarily an optimal result. Consequently, the need for a systematic and
multi-objective design methodology arises. A new conceptual design approach
based on a multi-criteria profile for mechatronic systems has been previously
presented by the authors which uses a series of nonlinear fuzzy-based
aggregation functions to facilitate decision-making for design evaluation in
the presence of interacting criteria. Choquet fuzzy integrals are one of the
most expressive and reliable preference models used in decision theory for
multicriteria decision making. They perform a weighted aggregation by the means
of fuzzy measures assigning a weight to any coalition of criteria. This enables
the designers to model importance and also interactions among criteria thus
covering an important range of possible decision outcomes. However,
specification of the fuzzy measures involves many parameters and is very
difficult when only relying on the designer's intuition. In this paper, we
discuss three different methods of fuzzy measure identification tailored for a
mechatronic design process and exemplified by a case study of designing a
vision-guided quadrotor drone. The results obtained from each method are
discussed in the end.

differences in their variability. We characterize the blazar variability using
the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, and investigate the features that are
discriminative for the two subtypes. We used optical photometric and
polarimetric data obtained with the 1.5-m Kanata telescope for 2008-2014. We
found that four features, namely the variation amplitude, characteristic
timescale, and non-stationarity of the variability obtained from the light
curves and the median of the degree of polarization (PD), are essential for
distinguishing between FSRQs and BL Lac objects. FSRQs are characterized by
rare and large flares, while the variability of BL Lac objects can be
reproduced with a stationary OU process with relatively small amplitudes. The
characteristics of the variability are governed not by the differences in the
jet structure between the subtypes, but by the peak frequency of the
synchrotron emission. This implies that the nature of the variation in the jets
is common in FSRQs and BL Lac objects. We found that BL Lac objects tend to
have high PD medians, which suggests that they have a stable polarization
component. FSRQs have no such component, possibly because of a strong Compton
cooling effect in sub-pc scale jets.

moving object modelling methods, aims to separate the temporally varying (i.e.,
moving) foreground objects from the static background in video, assuming the
background frames to be low-rank while the foreground to be spatially sparse.
Classic RPCA imposes sparsity of the foreground component using l1-norm, and
minimizes the modeling error via 2-norm. We show that such assumptions can be
too restrictive in practice, which limits the effectiveness of the classic
RPCA, especially when processing videos with dynamic background, camera jitter,
camouflaged moving object, etc. In this paper, we propose a novel RPCA-based
model, called Hyper RPCA, to detect moving objects on the fly. Different from
classic RPCA, the proposed Hyper RPCA jointly applies the maximum correntropy
criterion (MCC) for the modeling error, and Laplacian scale mixture (LSM) model
for foreground objects. Extensive experiments have been conducted, and the
results demonstrate that the proposed Hyper RPCA has competitive performance

models in the presence of outliers. Could the difference of boundaries
translate to adversarial examples that are non-transferable between 01 loss and
convex models? We explore this empirically in this paper by studying
transferability of adversarial examples between linear 01 loss and convex
(hinge) loss models, and between dual layer neural networks with sign
activation and 01 loss vs sigmoid activation and logistic loss. We first show
that white box adversarial examples do not transfer effectively between convex
and 01 loss and between 01 loss models compared to between convex models. As a
result of this non-transferability we see that convex substitute model black
box attacks are less effective on 01 loss than convex models. Interestingly we
also see that 01 loss substitute model attacks are ineffective on both convex
and 01 loss models mostly likely due to the non-uniqueness of 01 loss models.
We show intuitively by example how the presence of outliers can cause different
decision boundaries between 01 and convex loss models which in turn produces
adversaries that are non-transferable. Indeed we see on MNIST that adversaries
transfer between 01 loss and convex models more easily than on CIFAR10 and
ImageNet which are likely to contain outliers. We show intuitively by example
how the non-continuity of 01 loss makes adversaries non-transferable in a dual
layer neural network. We discretize CIFAR10 features to be more like MNIST and
find that it does not improve transferability, thus suggesting that different
boundaries due to outliers are more likely the cause of non-transferability. As
a result of this non-transferability we show that our dual layer sign

color information. We explore a novel direction of sensor fusion to exploit
stereo cameras. Geometric information from disparities helps separate
overlapping objects of the same or different classes. Moreover, geometric
information penalizes region proposals with unlikely 3D shapes thus suppressing
false positive detections. Mask regression is based on 2D, 2.5D, and 3D ROI
using the pseudo-lidar and image-based representations. These mask predictions
are fused by a mask scoring process. However, public datasets only adopt stereo
systems with shorter baseline and focal legnth, which limit measuring ranges of
stereo cameras. We collect and utilize High-Quality Driving Stereo (HQDS)
dataset, using much longer baseline and focal length with higher resolution.

relay cooperation ceiling (RCC) and overall system ceiling (OSC). Specifically,
the RCC prevents the relaying link from participating in cooperative
communications, while the OSC leaves the overall system in outage. Furthermore,
we derive the achievable diversity gain of the considered network, which shows
that the diversity gain equals either the shape parameter of the direct link or
zero. Computer simulations are provided to validate the correctness of our

rely heavily on estimating the noisy class posterior. However, the estimation
error for noisy class posterior could be large due to the randomness of label
noise, which would lead the transition matrix to be poorly estimated.
Therefore, in this paper, we aim to solve this problem by exploiting the
divide-and-conquer paradigm. Specifically, we introduce an intermediate class
to avoid directly estimating the noisy class posterior. By this intermediate
class, the original transition matrix can then be factorized into the product
of two easy-to-estimate transition matrices. We term the proposed method the
dual-T estimator. Both theoretical analyses and empirical results illustrate
the effectiveness of the dual-T estimator for estimating transition matrices,
leading to better classification performances.

learn an effective policy for the agent, it usually requires a huge amount of
data by interacting with the environment, which could be computational costly
and time consuming. To overcome this challenge, the framework called
Reinforcement Learning with Expert Demonstrations (RLED) was proposed to
exploit the supervision from expert demonstrations. Although the RLED methods
can reduce the number of learning iterations, they usually assume the
demonstrations are perfect, and thus may be seriously misled by the noisy
demonstrations in real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework to adaptively learn the policy by jointly interacting with the
environment and exploiting the expert demonstrations. Specifically, for each
step of the demonstration trajectory, we form an instance, and define a joint
loss function to simultaneously maximize the expected reward and minimize the
difference between agent behaviors and demonstrations. Most importantly, by
calculating the expected gain of the value function, we assign each instance
with a weight to estimate its potential utility, and thus can emphasize the
more helpful demonstrations while filter out noisy ones. Experimental results
in various environments with multiple popular reinforcement learning algorithms
show that the proposed approach can learn robustly with noisy demonstrations,
and achieve higher performance in fewer iterations.

content related to the main-task label. However, how to explicitly dispel the
noisy signals for better generalization in a controllable manner remains an
open issue. For instance, various factors such as identity-specific attributes,
pose, illumination and expression affect the appearance of face images.
Disentangling the identity-specific factors is potentially beneficial for
facial expression recognition (FER). This chapter systematically summarize the
detrimental factors as task-relevant/irrelevant semantic variations and
unspecified latent variation. In this chapter, these problems are casted as
either a deep metric learning problem or an adversarial minimax game in the
latent space. For the former choice, a generalized adaptive (N+M)-tuplet
clusters loss function together with the identity-aware hard-negative mining
and online positive mining scheme can be used for identity-invariant FER. The
better FER performance can be achieved by combining the deep metric loss and
softmax loss in a unified two fully connected layer branches framework via
joint optimization. For the latter solution, it is possible to equipping an
end-to-end conditional adversarial network with the ability to decompose an
input sample into three complementary parts. The discriminative representation
inherits the desired invariance property guided by prior knowledge of the task,
which is marginal independent to the task-relevant/irrelevant semantic and
latent variations. The framework achieves top performance on a serial of tasks,

social network or reveal only partially the inter-user ties (Reddit,
Stackoverflow). Many approaches require observing a discussion for some
considerable period before they can make useful predictions. In real-time
streaming scenarios, observations incur costs. Lastly, most models do not

published externally) and in-network effects (such as follow-up discussions on
Reddit) to determine engagement levels.
  To address the three limitations noted above, we propose a novel framework,
ChatterNet, which, to our knowledge, is the first that can model and predict
user engagement without considering the underlying user network. Given streams
of timestamped news articles and discussions, the task is to observe the
streams for a short period leading up to a time horizon, then predict chatter:
the volume of discussions through a specified period after the horizon.
ChatterNet processes text from news and discussions using a novel time-evolving
recurrent network architecture that captures both temporal properties within
news and discussions, as well as the influence of news on discussions. We
report on extensive experiments using a two-month-long discussion corpus of
Reddit, and a contemporaneous corpus of online news articles from the Common
Crawl. ChatterNet shows considerable improvements beyond recent
state-of-the-art models of engagement prediction. Detailed studies controlling
observation and prediction windows, over 43 different subreddits, yield further
useful insights.

reformulate the particle CS model as a first-order particle system and provide
the uniform-in-time stability for that particle system. We then extend this
stability estimate for the singular CS particle system. By using that stability
estimate, we construct the measure-valued solutions to the kinetic CS equation
globally in time. Moreover, as a direct application of the uniform-in-time
stability estimate, we show the quantitative uniform-in-time mean-field limit
from the particle system to that kinetic CS equation in $p$-Wasserstein
distance with $p \in [1,\infty]$. Our result gives the uniqueness of
measure-valued solution in the sense of mean-field limits, i.e., the
measure-valued solutions, approximated by the empirical measures associated to
the particle system, uniquely exist. Similar results for the first-order model

trajectories in the background to estimate one global transformation matrix or
several transformation matrices based on a fixed mesh, and warp shaky frames
into their stabilized views. However, these methods may not model the shaky
camera motion well in complicated scenes, such as scenes containing large
foreground objects or strong parallax, and may result in notable visual
artifacts in the stabilized videos. To resolve the above issues, this paper
proposes an adaptively meshed method to stabilize a shaky video based on all of
its feature trajectories and an adaptive blocking strategy. More specifically,
we first extract feature trajectories of the shaky video and then generate a
triangle mesh according to the distribution of the feature trajectories in each
frame. Then transformations between shaky frames and their stabilized views
over all triangular grids of the mesh are calculated to stabilize the shaky
video. Since more feature trajectories can usually be extracted from all
regions, including both background and foreground regions, a finer mesh will be
obtained and provided for camera motion estimation and frame warping. We
estimate the mesh-based transformations of each frame by solving a two-stage
optimization problem. Moreover, foreground and background feature trajectories
are no longer distinguished and both contribute to the estimation of the camera
motion in the proposed optimization problem, which yields better estimation
performance than previous works, particularly in challenging videos with large

variants (TDA-DHDFs). Most importantly, this is the first TDA-DHDF study since
Grimme and Neese's TDA-B2PLYP [J. Chem. Phys. 127, 154116 (2007)] and the first
work on TD-DHDFs that addresses singlet-triplet excitations. We show how the
difference between TD-DHDFs and TDA-DHDFs is often negligible for
singlet-singlet excitations, but how one has to apply TDA-DHDFs for triplet
excitations. For both excitation types, the LC is beneficial to the BLYP-based
DHDFs but detrimental to the PBE-based ones. For local-valence and Rydberg
excitations, {\omega}B2PLYP and {\omega}B2GP-PLYP as well as the global DHDF
PBE-QIDH can be recommended. If a transition exhibits charge-transfer
character, {\omega}B2PLYP and {\omega}B2GP-PLYP should be applied. An analysis
of the gaps between the first singlet and triplet excited states of our systems
revealed that there is room for further improvements to reach better
robustness. Until that goal has been achieved, we recommend {\omega}B2PLYP and
{\omega}B2GP-PLYP as some of the currently best TDA-DFT methods.

Arrokoth Hill was also explored through zero-velocity curves. Arrokoth's
external equilibrium points have no radial symmetry due to its highly irregular

equilibrium points, where two points are linearly stable, with an unstable
central point that has a slight offset from its centroid. Moreover, the large

structures from those found in Arrokoth. Our results also indicate that the
equatorial region of Arrokoth's lobes is an unstable area due to the high
rotation period, while its polar locations are stable resting sites for surface
particles. Finally, the zero-power curves indicate the locations around
Arrokoth where massless particles experience enhancing and receding orbital

learn to adaptively assign different weights for each feature representation
from the support images, and a bounding box prediction module that carries out
object detection on the reweighted feature maps. We build our few-shot object

learning results to date. However, understanding and controlling the latent
space of these models presents a considerable challenge. Drawing inspiration
from principal component analysis and autoencoder, we propose the Principal
Component Analysis Autoencoder (PCAAE). This is a novel autoencoder whose
latent space verifies two properties. Firstly, the dimensions are organised in
decreasing importance with respect to the data at hand. Secondly, the
components of the latent space are statistically independent. We achieve this
by progressively increasing the latent space during training, and with a
covariance loss applied to the latent codes. The resulting autoencoder produces
a latent space which separates the intrinsic attributes of the data into
different components of the latent space, in a completely unsupervised manner.
We also describe an extension of our approach to the case of powerful,
pre-trained GANs. We show results on both synthetic examples of shapes and on a
state-of-the-art GAN. For example, we are able to separate the color shade
scale of hair and skin, pose of faces and the gender in the CelebA, without
accessing any labels. We compare the PCAAE with other state-of-the-art
approaches, in particular with respect to the ability to disentangle attributes
in the latent space. We hope that this approach will contribute to better
understanding of the intrinsic latent spaces of powerful deep generative
models.

considering the alignment between input image and saliency map. In this work,
we provide a different perspective to this coupling, and provide a method,
Saliency based Adversarial training (SAT), to use saliency maps to improve
adversarial robustness of a model. In particular, we show that using
annotations such as bounding boxes and segmentation masks, already provided
with a dataset, as weak saliency maps, suffices to improve adversarial
robustness with no additional effort to generate the perturbations themselves.
Our empirical results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny ImageNet and Flower-17
datasets consistently corroborate our claim, by showing improved adversarial
robustness using our method. saliency maps. We also show how using finer and
stronger saliency maps leads to more robust models, and how integrating SAT
with existing adversarial training methods, further boosts performance of these
existing methods.

where the mainstream approaches are in pointwise manners. Meanwhile, pairwise
manners have shown great potential in supervised metric learning and
unsupervised contrastive learning. Thus, a natural question is raised: does
learning in a pairwise manner mitigate label noise? To give an affirmative
answer, in this paper, we propose a framework called Class2Simi: it transforms
data points with noisy class labels to data pairs with noisy similarity labels,
where a similarity label denotes whether a pair shares the class label or not.
Through this transformation, the reduction of the noise rate is theoretically
guaranteed, and hence it is in principle easier to handle noisy similarity
labels. Amazingly, DNNs that predict the clean class labels can be trained from
noisy data pairs if they are first pretrained from noisy data points.
Class2Simi is computationally efficient because not only this transformation is
on-the-fly in mini-batches, but also it just changes loss computation on top of
model prediction into a pairwise manner. Its effectiveness is verified by
extensive experiments.

protect the vulnerable parts of human body from electromagnetic exposure during

Besides, a finer beam management granularity is adopted to better balance the
trade-off between exposure reduction and communication quality loss, because
finer beams can provide more adjustability for finding the beam that reduces

segmentation. Most recent methods mine the object regions by expanding the seed
regions localized by class activation maps. They generally do not consider the
sizes of objects and apply a monotonous procedure to mining all the object
regions. Thus their mined regions are often insufficient in number and scale
for large objects, and on the other hand easily contaminated by surrounding
backgrounds for small objects. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-miner
framework to perform a region mining process that adapts to diverse object
sizes and is thus able to mine more integral and finer object regions.
Specifically, our multi-miner leverages a parallel modulator to check whether
there are remaining object regions for each single object, and guide a
category-aware generator to mine the regions of each object independently. In
this way, the multi-miner adaptively takes more steps for large objects and
fewer steps for small objects. Experiment results demonstrate that the
multi-miner offers better region mining results and helps achieve better
segmentation performance than state-of-the-art weakly-supervised semantic
segmentation methods.

exploiting anchor points (i.e., data points that belong to a specific class

provide a potential solution, it is extremely challenging to exploit them. In
this paper, we address this problem by leveraging Positive-Unlabeled~(PU)
classification and conditional generation with extra unlabeled data
\emph{simultaneously}, both of which aim to make full use of agnostic unlabeled
data to improve classification and generation performances. In particular, we
present a novel training framework to jointly target both PU classification and
conditional generation when exposing to extra data, especially
out-of-distribution unlabeled data, by exploring the interplay between them: 1)
enhancing the performance of PU classifiers with the assistance of a novel
Conditional Generative Adversarial Network~(CGAN) that is robust to noisy
labels, 2) leveraging extra data with predicted labels from a PU classifier to
help the generation. Our key contribution is a Classifier-Noise-Invariant
Conditional GAN~(CNI-CGAN) that can learn the clean data distribution from
noisy labels predicted by a PU classifier. Theoretically, we proved the optimal
condition of CNI-CGAN and experimentally, we conducted extensive evaluations on
diverse datasets, verifying the simultaneous improvements on both

gender information in face descriptors has two major issues: (a.) It makes the
descriptors susceptible to privacy leakage, i.e. a malicious agent can be
trained to predict the face gender from such descriptors. (b.) It appears to
contribute to gender bias in face recognition, i.e. we find a significant
difference in the recognition accuracy of DCNNs on male and female faces.
Therefore, we present a novel `Adversarial Gender De-biasing algorithm

from previously trained face recognition networks. We show that AGENDA
significantly reduces gender predictability of face descriptors. Consequently,
we are also able to reduce gender bias in face verification while maintaining

Gaussian or a log-normal, provides key insight into the nature of its
variability. For lightcurves of moderate length ($< 10^3$), a useful first
analysis is to test the Gaussianity of the flux and logarithm of the flux, by
estimating the skewness and applying the Anderson-Darling (AD) method. We
perform extensive simulations of lightcurves with different lengths,
variability, Gaussian measurement errors and power spectrum index $\beta$ (i.e.
$P(f) \propto f^{-\beta}$), to provide a prescriptionand guidelines for
reliable use of these two tests. We present empirical fits for the expected
standard deviation of skewness and tabulated AD test critical values for $\beta
= 0.5$ and $1.0$, which differ from the values given in the literature which
are for white noise ($\beta = 0$). Moreover, we show that for white noise, for
most practical situations, these tests are meaningless, since binning in time
alters the flux distribution. For $\beta \gtrsim 1.5$, the skewness variance
does not decrease with length and hence the tests are not reliable. Thus, such
tests can be applied only to systems with $\beta\gtrsim 0.5$ and $\beta
\lesssim 1.0$. As an example of the prescription given in this work, we
reconfirm that the Fermi data of the blazar, 3FGL\,J0730.2-1141, shows that its
$\gamma$ ray flux is consistent with a log-normal distribution and not with a
Gaussian one.

Model (NMSSM) allows the possibility that the lightest neutralino could have a

component of relic dark matter (DM). Such a neutralino can provide an invisible
decay mode to the Higgs as well. Further, the observed SM-like Higgs boson
($H_{125}$) could also have an invisible branching fraction as high as $\sim
19\%$. Led by these facts, we first delineate the region of parameter space of
the NMSSM with a light neutralino ($M_{{\tilde{\chi}}_{1}^{0}} < 62.5 {\rm
GeV}$) that yields a thermal neutralino relic density smaller than the measured
relic density of cold dark matter, and is also compatible with constraints from
collider searches, searches for dark matter, and from flavor physics. We then
examine the prospects for probing the NMSSM with a light neutralino via direct
DM detection searches, via invisible Higgs boson width experiments at future
$e^+e^-$ colliders, via searches for a light singlet Higgs boson in $2b2\mu$,
$2b2\tau$ and $2\mu2\tau$ channels and via pair production of winos or doublet
higgsinos at the high luminosity LHC and its proposed energy upgrade. For this

essentially the entire region with higgsinos (winos) lighter than 1 TeV (2 TeV)

In contrast to local collision detection strategies used in, e.g., physical
simulation, this energy considers interactions between all pairs of points, and
is hence useful for global shape optimization: local minima tend to be
aesthetically pleasing, physically valid, and nicely distributed in space. A
reformulation of gradient descent, based on a Sobolev-Slobodeckij inner product
enables us to make rapid progress toward local minima---independent of curve
resolution. We also develop a hierarchical multigrid scheme that significantly
reduces the per-step cost of optimization. The energy is easily integrated with
a variety of constraints and penalties (e.g., inextensibility, or obstacle
avoidance), which we use for applications including curve packing, knot
untangling, graph embedding, non-crossing spline interpolation, flow
visualization, and robotic path planning.

issue. This is becoming increasingly important since a measure of student
satisfaction is taken as an indication of how well a course has been taught.
However, it remains a challenging problem as student satisfaction has various
aspects. In this paper, we formulate the student satisfaction estimation as a
prediction problem where we predict different levels of student satisfaction
and infer the influential predictors related to course and instructor. We
present five different aspects of student satisfaction in terms of 1) course
content, 2) class participation, 3) achievement of initial expectations about
the course, 4) relevancy towards professional development, and 5) if the course
connects them and helps to explore the real-world situations. We employ
state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to predict each of these aspects
of student satisfaction levels. For our experiment, we utilize a large student
evaluation dataset which includes student perception using different attributes
related to courses and the instructors. Our experimental results and
comprehensive analysis reveal that student satisfaction is more influenced by
course attributes in comparison to instructor related attributes.

extending the original Cityscapes dataset with 3D bounding box annotations for
all types of vehicles. In contrast to existing datasets, our 3D annotations
were labeled using stereo RGB images only and capture all nine degrees of

higher range of annotations compared to lidar-based approaches. In order to

approaches gain increasing attention for identifying nonparametric models. In
order to increase the prediction performance of these models, abstract prior

a nonparametric Gaussian process state space model from the data and show that
it is capable of reproducing observed data exactly. We prove that stabilization
of the nominal model based on the nonparametric control Lyapunov function does

Precision medicine research requires information from all available datasets to

create a prediction model which uses information from both clinical and
genomics datasets. We have demonstrated multiclass disease predictions based on
combined clinical and genomics datasets using machine learning methods. We have
created an integrated dataset, using a clinical (ClinVar) and a genomics (gene
expression) dataset, and trained it using instance-based learner to predict
clinical diseases. We have used an innovative but simple way for multiclass
classification, where the number of output classes is as high as 75. We have
used Principal Component Analysis for feature selection. The classifier
predicted diseases with 73\% accuracy on the integrated dataset. The results
were consistent and competent when compared with other classification models.
The results show that genomics information can be reliably included in datasets
for clinical predictions and it can prove to be valuable in clinical
diagnostics and precision medicine.

  correction","A&A 641, A38 (2020)","10.1051/0004-6361/202038058",,"astro-ph.EP astro-ph.SR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The presence of a massive close-in planet with an orbital period of a few
days or less around a low-mass star can possibly results in a strong variation
of the properties of the central star. Indeed, star-planet tidal interactions
generate exchanges of angular momentum that can results in tidal spin-up. This
effect could then lead to gyrochronological ages biased towards younger ages.
Aims. This article provides the community with TATOO, a standalone tool based
on tidal-chronology, to estimate the age of a massive close-in planetary system
by only using its observed properties: mass of the planet and the star, stellar
rotational and planetary orbital periods. I used the numerical code described
in Gallet et al. (2018) to create a large multi-parametric grid of synthetic
star-planet systems evolution, and 3D interpolation method to provide a fairly
precise age estimate, using tidal-chronology technique, of any given planetary
systems composed of at least of one massive close-in planet. About half of the
planetary systems investigated in this work are subject to tidal spin-up bias.
I pointed out that this bias linearly scales with the ratio between rotation to
orbital period, making this quantity a useful proxy to rapidly investigate the
need to use tidal-chronology. Moreover, while being model dependent, TATOO can
also be used even if no rotational departure is present. In that case, it gives
results in agreement with the classical gyrochronological analysis. TATOO is a
useful tool specifically designed for massive close-in planetary systems that
can also be used as a classical gyrochronological tool. For now it is the only
publicly available software to estimate the age of massive close-in planetary
systems subject to tidal spin-up. In that sense, tidal-chronology can be seen
as a first order correction of the impact of tidal interaction on
gyrochronology.

content, in heterogeneous brain tissue. Methods: A diffusion-$T_1$ correlation
experiment was carried out on an in vivo human brain using tensor-valued
diffusion encoding and multiple repetition times. The acquired data was
inverted using a Monte-Carlo inversion algorithm that retrieves non-parametric
distributions $\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{D},R_1)$ of diffusion tensors and
longitudinal relaxation rates $R_1 = 1/T_1$. Orientation distribution functions
(ODFs) of the highly anisotropic components of $\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{D},R_1)$
were defined to visualize orientation-specific diffusion-relaxation properties.
Finally, Monte-Carlo density-peak clustering (MC-DPC) was performed to quantify
fiber-specific features and investigate microstructural differences between
white-matter fiber bundles. Results: Parameter maps corresponding to
$\mathcal{P}(\mathbf{D},R_1)$'s statistical descriptors were obtained,
exhibiting the expected $R_1$ contrast between brain-tissue types. Our ODFs
recovered local orientations consistent with the known anatomy and indicated
possible differences in $T_1$ relaxation between major fiber bundles. These
differences, confirmed by MC-DPC, were in qualitative agreement with previous
model-based works but seem biased by the limitations of our current
experimental setup. Conclusions: Our Monte-Carlo framework enables the
non-parametric estimation of fiber-specific diffusion-$T_1$ features, thereby
showing potential for characterizing developmental or pathological changes in
$T_1$ within a given fiber bundle, and for investigating inter-bundle $T_1$
differences.

naturally does not rely on voxel-by-voxel correspondence and is robust to
noise. We show that these time-varying persistence diagrams can be clustered to
find meaningful groupings between participants, and that they are also useful
in studying within-subject brain state trajectories of subjects performing a
particular task. Here, we apply both clustering and trajectory analysis
techniques to a group of participants watching the movie 'Partly Cloudy'. We
observe significant differences in both brain state trajectories and overall
topological activity between adults and children watching the same movie.

unprecedentedly large shear strain up to 21.5 % in a hybrid ferroelectric,
C6H5N(CH3)3CdCl3. The strain response is about two orders of magnitude higher
than those of top-performing conventional ferroelectric polymers and oxides. It
is achieved via inorganic bond switching and facilitated by the structural
confinement of the large organic moieties, which prevents the undesired
180-degree polarization switching. Furthermore, Br substitution can effectively
soften the bonds and result in giant shear piezoelectric coefficient (d35 ~

detect depression signals from social media posts have shown promising results.
Given the high internal validity, results from such analyses are potentially
beneficial to clinical judgment. The existing models for automatic detection of
depressive symptoms learn proxy diagnostic signals from social media data, such
as help-seeking behavior for mental health or medication names. However, in
reality, individuals with depression typically experience depressed mood, loss
of pleasure nearly in all the activities, feeling of worthlessness or guilt,
and diminished ability to think. Therefore, a lot of the proxy signals used in
these models lack the theoretical underpinnings for depressive symptoms. It is
also reported that social media posts from many patients in the clinical
setting do not contain these signals. Based on this research gap, we propose to
monitor a type of signal that is well-established as a class of symptoms in
affective disorders -- mood. The mood is an experience of feeling that can last
for hours, days, or even weeks. In this work, we attempt to enrich current
technology for detecting symptoms of potential depression by constructing a
'mood profile' for social media users.

previous methods, G-Meta successfully learns in challenging, few-shot learning

maximum flatness algorithms either directly on the classifier (which is norm

fusion for speech activity detection, PLDA score fusion for diarization, and
lattice combination for automatic speech recognition (ASR). We also report
results with different acoustic model architectures, and integrate other
techniques such as online multi-channel weighted prediction error (WPE)
dereverberation and variational Bayes-hidden Markov model (VB-HMM) based
overlap assignment to deal with reverberation and overlapping speakers,
respectively. As a result of these efforts, our ASR systems achieve a word
error rate of 40.5% and 67.5% on tracks 1 and 2, respectively, on the

a neural implant. By integrating model compression with probabilistic routing
and implementing cost-aware learning, our proposed model could significantly
reduce the memory and hardware cost compared to state-of-the-art models, while
maintaining the classification accuracy. We trained the resource-efficient
oblique tree with power-efficient regularization (ResOT-PE) on three neural
classification tasks to evaluate the performance, memory, and hardware
requirements. On seizure detection task, we were able to reduce the model size
by 3.4X and the feature extraction cost by 14.6X compared to the ensemble of
boosted trees, using the intracranial EEG from 10 epilepsy patients. In a
second experiment, we tested the ResOT-PE model on tremor detection for
Parkinson's disease, using the local field potentials from 12 patients
implanted with a deep-brain stimulation (DBS) device. We achieved a comparable
classification performance as the state-of-the-art boosted tree ensemble, while
reducing the model size and feature extraction cost by 10.6X and 6.8X,
respectively. We also tested on a 6-class finger movement detection task using
ECoG recordings from 9 subjects, reducing the model size by 17.6X and feature
computation cost by 5.1X. The proposed model can enable a low-power and
memory-efficient implementation of classifiers for real-time neurological
disease detection and motor decoding.

give rise to different evolution histories of the thermal and ionization state
of the universe and hence influences the CMB spectrum at small scales through
the tSZ effect. In this work, we have computed the evolution of the
temperature, ionization fraction and the y-parameter of the CMB for different
strengths of the magnetic field and the interaction cross-section. We note that
an interaction cross-section of $\sigma_0=10^{-42}$ m$^{2}$ (with a magnetic

landslide occurrence intensity by using geomorphological covariates available
at high spatial resolution. However, the spatial distribution of the triggering
event (e.g., precipitation or earthquakes) is often not directly observed. In
this paper, we develop Bayesian spatial hierarchical models for point patterns
of landslide occurrences using different types of log-Gaussian Cox processes.
Starting from a competitive baseline model that captures the unobserved
precipitation trigger through a spatial random effect at slope unit resolution,
we explore novel complex model structures that take clusters of events arising
at small spatial scales into account, as well as nonlinear or spatially-varying
covariate effects. For a 2009 event of around 4000 precipitation-triggered
landslides in Sicily, Italy, we show how to fit our proposed models efficiently
using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA), and rigorously
compare the performance of our models both from a statistical and applied
perspective. In this context, we argue that model comparison should not be
based on a single criterion, and that different models of various complexity
may provide insights into complementary aspects of the same applied problem. In
our application, our models are found to have mostly the same spatial
predictive performance, implying that key to successful prediction is the
inclusion of a slope-unit resolved random effect capturing the precipitation
trigger. Interestingly, a parsimonious formulation of space-varying slope
effects reflects a physical interpretation of the precipitation trigger: in
subareas with weak trigger, the slope steepness is shown to be mostly
irrelevant.

associated with the underlying training algorithm is not well-studied in the

establish an asymptotic normality result for the constant step size stochastic
gradient descent (SGD) algorithm--a widely used algorithm in practice.
Specifically, based on the relationship between SGD and Markov Chains [DDB19],
we show that the average of SGD iterates is asymptotically normally distributed
around the expected value of their unique invariant distribution, as long as
the non-convex and non-smooth objective function satisfies a dissipativity
property. We also characterize the bias between this expected value and the
critical points of the objective function under various local regularity
conditions. Together, the above two results could be leveraged to construct
confidence intervals for non-convex problems that are trained using the SGD
algorithm.

with full-bandit feedback (CPE-BL), where a learner is given a combinatorial
action space $\mathcal{X} \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, and in each round the learner
pulls an action $x \in \mathcal{X}$ and receives a random reward with
expectation $x^{\top} \theta$, with $\theta \in \mathbb{R}^d$ a latent and

with the highest expected reward, using as few samples as possible. For CPE-BL,
we design the first {\em polynomial-time adaptive} algorithm, whose sample
complexity matches the lower bound (within a logarithmic factor) for a family
of instances and has a light dependence of $\Delta_{\min}$ (the smallest gap
between the optimal action and sub-optimal actions). Furthermore, we propose a
novel generalization of CPE-BL with flexible feedback structures, called
combinatorial pure exploration with partial linear feedback (CPE-PL), which
encompasses several families of sub-problems including full-bandit feedback,
semi-bandit feedback, partial feedback and nonlinear reward functions. In
CPE-PL, each pull of action $x$ reports a random feedback vector with
expectation of $M_{x} \theta $, where $M_x \in \mathbb{R}^{m_x \times d}$ is a
transformation matrix for $x$, and gains a random (possibly nonlinear) reward
related to $x$. For CPE-PL, we develop the first {\em polynomial-time}
algorithm, which simultaneously addresses limited feedback, general reward
function and combinatorial action space, and provide its sample complexity
analysis. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our algorithms run orders
of magnitude faster than the existing ones, and our CPE-BL algorithm is robust
across different $\Delta_{\min}$ settings while our CPE-PL algorithm is the
only one returning correct answers for nonlinear reward functions.

suicide/HIV prevention or community preparedness against natural disasters,
leverage social network information to maximize outreach. Algorithmic influence
maximization techniques have been proposed to aid with the choice of ""peer
leaders"" or ""influencers"" in such interventions. Yet, traditional algorithms
for influence maximization have not been designed with these interventions in
mind. As a result, they may disproportionately exclude minority communities
from the benefits of the intervention. This has motivated research on fair
influence maximization. Existing techniques come with two major drawbacks.
First, they require committing to a single fairness measure. Second, these
measures are typically imposed as strict constraints leading to undesirable
properties such as wastage of resources.
  To address these shortcomings, we provide a principled characterization of
the properties that a fair influence maximization algorithm should satisfy. In
particular, we propose a framework based on social welfare theory, wherein the
cardinal utilities derived by each community are aggregated using the
isoelastic social welfare functions. Under this framework, the trade-off
between fairness and efficiency can be controlled by a single inequality
aversion design parameter. We then show under what circumstances our proposed
principles can be satisfied by a welfare function. The resulting optimization
problem is monotone and submodular and can be solved efficiently with
optimality guarantees. Our framework encompasses as special cases leximin and
proportional fairness. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real world
datasets including a case study on landslide risk management demonstrate the
efficacy of the proposed framework.

this rather major shortcoming, this work shows how a variational Bayesian
Gaussian mixture model (vBGMM) framework can be employed to predict the future

incorporating presence of uncertainty within a prediction horizon. In this
work, the full predictive conditional probability density function (PDF) with
mean and covariance is obtained, and thus a future trajectory with uncertainty
is formulated as a collision region represented by a confidence ellipsoid. To
avoid the collision region, chance constraints are imposed to restrict the
collision probability, and subsequently a nonlinear MPC problem is constructed
with these chance constraints. It is shown that the proposed approach is able
to predict the future position of the moving obstacles effectively; and thus
based on the environmental information of the probabilistic prediction, it is
also shown that the timing of collision avoidance can be earlier than the
method without prediction. The tracking error and distance to obstacles of the
trajectory with prediction are smaller compared with the method without
prediction.

the same magnitude of friction force when sliding along the nonpolar path,
independent of the material and the surface structures. In contrast, for
sliding friction along the polar path, the friction force obeys a universal

constituent atoms. Further analyses demonstrate that atomic dipoles in the 2D
monolayers induced by the electronegativity difference enhance the corrugation
of charge distribution and increase the sliding barrier accordingly. Our

  Uncertainty Quantification","19 pages, 7 figures, NeurIPS 2020",,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Subgroup analysis of treatment effects plays an important role in
applications from medicine to public policy to recommender systems. It allows
physicians (for example) to identify groups of patients for whom a given drug
or treatment is likely to be effective and groups of patients for which it is
not. Most of the current methods of subgroup analysis begin with a particular
algorithm for estimating individualized treatment effects (ITE) and identify
subgroups by maximizing the difference across subgroups of the average
treatment effect in each subgroup. These approaches have several weaknesses:
they rely on a particular algorithm for estimating ITE, they ignore
(in)homogeneity within identified subgroups, and they do not produce good
confidence estimates. This paper develops a new method for subgroup analysis,
R2P, that addresses all these weaknesses. R2P uses an arbitrary, exogenously
prescribed algorithm for estimating ITE and quantifies the uncertainty of the
ITE estimation, using a construction that is more robust than other methods.
Experiments using synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets (based on real data)
demonstrate that R2P constructs partitions that are simultaneously more
homogeneous within groups and more heterogeneous across groups than the
partitions produced by other methods. Moreover, because R2P can employ any ITE
estimator, it also produces much narrower confidence intervals with a
prescribed coverage guarantee than other methods.

luminosity $\gtrsim 2.2\times 10^{18}$ erg/s/Hz (corresponding to $M_V \lesssim
6.0$) is required to produce a radio detection. We also observe that the X-ray

$L_{X} \propto L_{R}^{\sim 0.7}$ power law originally proposed for
non-pulsating neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries. We find no other
correlations between the radio emission and emission in other wavebands or any
other system parameters for the existing sample of radio-detected non-magnetic

rides across areas in their operating road-networks. As such, dynamic pricing
methods have been used to mediate these demand asymmetries through surge price
multipliers, thus incentivising higher driver participation in the market.
However, the anticipated commercialisation of autonomous vehicles could
transform the current ride-sourcing platforms to fleet operators. The absence
of human drivers fosters the need for empty vehicle management to address any
vehicle supply deficiencies. Proactive redistribution using integer programming
and demand predictive models have been proposed in research to address this
problem. A shortcoming of existing models, however, is that they ignore the
market structure and underlying customer choice behaviour. As such, current
models do not capture the real value of redistribution. To resolve this, we
formulate the vehicle redistribution problem as a non-linear minimum cost flow
problem which accounts for the relationship of supply and demand of rides, by
assuming a customer discrete choice model and a market structure. We
demonstrate that this model can have a convex domain, and we introduce an edge
splitting algorithm to solve a transformed convex minimum cost flow problem for
vehicle redistribution. By testing our model using simulation, we show that our
redistribution algorithm can decrease wait times by more than 50%, increase
profit up to 10% with less than 20% increase in vehicle mileage. Our findings
outline that the value of redistribution is contingent on localised market
structure and customer behaviour.

analyzing data with heterogeneous conditional distributions, especially when
quantiles of response variable are of interest, due to its robustness to
outliers and heavy-tailed errors in the response. It assumes different linear
quantile regression forms in different regions of the domain of the threshold
covariate but are still continuous at kink points. In this paper, we
investigate parameter estimation, kink point detection and statistical
inference in MKQR models. We propose an iterative segmented quantile regression
algorithm for estimating both the regression coefficients and the locations of
kink points. The proposed algorithm is much more computationally efficient than
the grid search algorithm and not sensitive to the selection of initial values.
Asymptotic properties, such as selection consistency of the number of kink
points, asymptotic normality of the estimators of both regression coefficients
and kink effects, are established to justify the proposed method theoretically.
A score test, based on partial subgradients, is developed to verify whether the
kink effects exist or not. Test-inversion confidence intervals for kink
location parameters are also constructed. Intensive simulation studies
conducted show the proposed methods work very well when sample size is finite.
Finally, we apply the MKQR models together with the proposed methods to the
dataset about secondary industrial structure of China and the dataset about
triceps skinfold thickness of Gambian females, which leads to some very
interesting findings. A new R package MultiKink is developed to implement the
proposed methods.

partitioned into a part represented by a finite size Wilson chain and a part
represented by a set of additional reservoirs, each coupled to one Wilson chain

environment neglected by the numerical renormalization group and are required
to restore the continuum limit of the original problem. We present a hybrid
time-dependent numerical renormalization group approach which combines an
accurate numerical renormalization group treatment of the non-equilibrium
dynamics on the finite size Wilson chain with a Bloch-Redfield formalism to
include the effect of these additional reservoirs. Our approach overcomes the
intrinsic shortcoming of the time-dependent numerical renormalization group
approach induced by the bath discretization with a Wilson parameter $\Lambda >
1$. We analytically prove that for a system with a single chemical potential,
the thermal equilibrium reduced density operator is the steady-state solution
of the Bloch-Redfield master equation. For the numerical solution of this
master equation a Lanczos method is employed which couples all energy shells of
the numerical renormalization group. The presented hybrid approach is applied
to the real-time dynamics in correlated fermionic quantum-impurity systems. An
analytical solution of the resonant-level model serves as a benchmark for the
accuracy of the method which is then applied to non-trivial models, such as the
interacting resonant-level model and the single impurity Anderson model.

underpins a few instance-level recognition tasks and many downstream
applications. Recently one-stage methods have gained much attention over
two-stage approaches due to their simpler design and competitive performance.
Here we propose a fully convolutional one-stage object detector (FCOS) to solve
object detection in a per-pixel prediction fashion, analogue to other dense
prediction problems such as semantic segmentation. Almost all state-of-the-art
object detectors such as RetinaNet, SSD, YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN rely on
pre-defined anchor boxes. In contrast, our proposed detector FCOS is anchor box
free, as well as proposal free. By eliminating the pre-defined set of anchor
boxes, FCOS completely avoids the complicated computation related to anchor
boxes such as calculating the intersection over union (IoU) scores during
training. More importantly, we also avoid all hyper-parameters related to
anchor boxes, which are often sensitive to the final detection performance.
With the only post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS), we demonstrate a
much simpler and flexible detection framework achieving improved detection
accuracy. We hope that the proposed FCOS framework can serve as a simple and
strong alternative for many other instance-level tasks. Code and pre-trained

Also, the fuzzy metric structures on fuzzy normed gyrogroups are discussed. In
the last, the fuzzy metric completion of a gyrogroup with an invariant metric
are studied. We mainly show that let $d$ be an invariant metric on a gyrogroup
$G$ and $(\widehat{G},\widehat{d})$ is the metric completion of the metric
space $(G,d)$; then for any continuous $t$-norm $\ast$, the standard fuzzy
metric space $(\widehat{G},M_{\widehat{d}},\ast)$ of

completion of the standard fuzzy metric space $(G,M_d,\ast)$ of $(G,d)$;
furthermore, $(\widehat{G},M_{\widehat{d}},\ast)$ is a fuzzy metric gyrogroup

  Representation",,,,,"cs.LG cs.CV stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In recent years, we have witnessed a surge of interest in multi-view
representation learning, which is concerned with the problem of learning
representations of multi-view data. When facing multiple views that are highly
related but sightly different from each other, most of existing multi-view
methods might fail to fully integrate multi-view information. Besides,
correlations between features from multiple views always vary seriously, which
makes multi-view representation challenging. Therefore, how to learn
appropriate embedding from multi-view information is still an open problem but
challenging. To handle this issue, this paper proposes a novel multi-view
learning method, named Multi-view Low-rank Preserving Embedding (MvLPE). It
integrates different views into one centroid view by minimizing the
disagreement term, based on distance or similarity matrix among instances,
between the centroid view and each view meanwhile maintaining low-rank
reconstruction relations among samples for each view, which could make more
full use of compatible and complementary information from multi-view features.
Unlike existing methods with additive parameters, the proposed method could
automatically allocate a suitable weight for each view in multi-view
information fusion. However, MvLPE couldn't be directly solved, which makes the
proposed MvLPE difficult to obtain an analytic solution. To this end, we
approximate this solution based on stationary hypothesis and normalization
post-processing to efficiently obtain the optimal solution. Furthermore, an
iterative alternating strategy is provided to solve this multi-view
representation problem. The experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms its counterparts while achieving very
competitive performance.

issues. In this research, we propose a novel LSTM-TrajGAN approach, which is an
end-to-end deep learning model to generate privacy-preserving synthetic
trajectory data for data sharing and publication. We design a loss metric
function TrajLoss to measure the trajectory similarity losses for model
training and optimization. The model is evaluated on the
trajectory-user-linking task on a real-world semantic trajectory dataset.
Compared with other common geomasking methods, our model can better prevent
users from being re-identified, and it also preserves essential spatial,
temporal, and thematic characteristics of the real trajectory data. The model
better balances the effectiveness of trajectory privacy protection and the
utility for spatial and temporal analyses, which offers new insights into the
GeoAI-powered privacy protection.

plant based on fuzzy control and automation of generating the fuzzy rule base.
Fuzzy rules by experts do not always provide a maximum power output of the wind
plant and fuzzy rule bases require an adjustment in the case of changing the
parameters of the wind power plant or the environment. This research proposes
the method for optimizing the fuzzy rules base compiled by various experts. The
method is based on balancing weights of fuzzy rules into the base by the
Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. The experiment has shown that the
proposed method allows forming the fuzzy rule base as an exemplary optimal base
from a non-optimized set of fuzzy rules. The optimal fuzzy rule base has been
taken under consideration for the concrete control loop of wind power plant and
the concrete fuzzy model of the wind.

such as either model-based or model-free, policy-based or planning-based,
on-policy or off-policy, and online or offline. Broad classification schemes
such as these help provide a unified perspective on disparate techniques and
can contextualise and guide the development of new algorithms. In this paper,
we utilise the control as inference framework to outline a novel classification
scheme based on amortised and iterative inference. We demonstrate that a wide
range of algorithms can be classified in this manner providing a fresh
perspective and highlighting a range of existing similarities. Moreover, we
show that taking this perspective allows us to identify parts of the
algorithmic design space which have been relatively unexplored, suggesting new
routes to innovative RL algorithms.

the origin of cold dark matter, which represents more than 84% of the mass in
the universe. Dark matter reacts on and produces gravitational forces and
governs the dynamics of stars around galactic centres, however, does not absorb
or emit any kind of electromagnetic radiation. So far, any relation to known
types of matter has not been conclusive, and proposed new particles have not
been found. Here, I propose and discuss how dark matter evolved from
ultra-light fermionic particles that decoupled from the rest of the universe
shortly after the Big Bang. My description explicitly considers their
interference, and reveals the emergence of entanglement between two such
particles, as well as their transformation to massive dark-matter quantum
fields of cosmic sizes. Furthermore, I argue that dark matter and supermassive
black holes have the same origin and evolved simultaneously. If the particles'
decoupling time was about half a second after the Big Bang, my hypothesis
predicts a minimum mass for supermassive black holes that fits well to the
smallest known such object of 50,000 solar masses. It seems very much likely
that the ultra-light fermionic particle was the neutrino.

  models of visual cortex",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A key challenge in understanding the sensory transformations of the visual
system is to obtain a highly predictive model of responses from visual cortical
neurons. Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a promising candidate for such a
model. However, DNNs require orders of magnitude more training data than
neuroscientists can collect from real neurons because experimental recording
time is severely limited. This motivates us to find images that train
highly-predictive DNNs with as little training data as possible. We propose
gaudy images---high-contrast binarized versions of natural images---to
efficiently train DNNs. In extensive simulation experiments, we find that
training DNNs with gaudy images substantially reduces the number of training
images needed to accurately predict the simulated responses of visual cortical
neurons. We also find that gaudy images, chosen before training, outperform
images chosen during training by active learning algorithms. Thus, gaudy images
overemphasize features of natural images, especially edges, that are the most
important for efficiently training DNNs. We believe gaudy images will aid in
the modeling of visual cortical neurons, potentially opening new scientific
questions about visual processing, as well as aid general practitioners that
seek ways to improve the training of DNNs.

transportation that is robust against defects and impurities are typically
realized in coupled arrays of two-dimensional ring resonators. These systems
have produced a series of applications, including optical isolators, delay
lines, and lasers. However, the structures are complicated because an
additional coupler ring between neighboring rings is needed to construct
photonic pseudo-spin. In this work, a photonic analogue of the quantum spin
Hall effect is proposed and experimentally demonstrated in an anomalous Floquet
topological insulator in the microwave regime. This improved design takes
advantage of the efficient and backward coupling of negative-index media. The
results contribute to the understanding of topological structures in
metamaterials and point toward a new direction for constructing useful
topological photonic devices.

Ensembles (MMEs) out of deep neural network weight matrices and {\it conjugate
circular ensemble} matching the neural architecture topology. Following this,
the empirical evidence supports the {\it phenomenon} that difference between
spectral densities of neural architectures and corresponding {\it conjugate
circular ensemble} are vanishing with different decay rates at the long
positive tail part of the spectrum i.e., cumulative Circular Spectral
Difference (CSD). This finding can be used in establishing equivalences among
different neural architectures via analysis of fluctuations in CSD. We
investigated this phenomenon for a wide range of deep learning vision
architectures and with circular ensembles originating from statistical quantum
mechanics. Practical implications of the proposed method for artificial and
natural neural architectures discussed such as the possibility of using the
approach in Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and classification of biological

since its first statement in 1959, including resolutions based on relativistic
stress due to Lorentz contractions. The paradox is that two ships, starting
from the same reference frame and subject to the same acceleration, would snap
a string that connected them, even as their separation distance would not
change as measured from the original reference frame. This paper uses a Simple
Relativity approach to resolve the paradox and explain both why the string
snaps, and how to adjust accelerations to avoid snapping the string. In doing
so, an interesting parallel understanding of the Lorentz contraction is
generated. The solution is applied to rotation to address the Ehrenfest paradox
and orbital precession as well.
