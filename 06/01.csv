of two interacting qubits homogeneously coupled to a spin bath via the
$XXZ$-type coupling, with the bath initially prepared in linear superpositions
of the symmetric Dicke states. Using the interaction picture Hamiltonian with
respect to the non-spin-flipping part of the model, we derive a sequence of
equations of motion within each magnetization sector satisfied by the
probability amplitudes of the time-evolved state. These equations of motion
admit analytical solutions for the single-qubit CSM in which one of the two
central qubits decouples from the rest of the system. Based on this, we provide
a quantitative interpretation to the observed collapse-revival phenomena in the
single-qubit Rabi oscillations when the bath is prepared in the spin coherent
state. We then study the disentanglement and coherence dynamics of two
initially entangled noninteracting qubits when the two qubits interact with
individual baths or with a common bath. For individual baths the coherent
dynamics is found to positively correlated to the single-qubit purity dynamics,
and entanglement sudden disappearance and revivals are observed in both cases.
The entanglement creation of two initially separable qubits coupled to a common
bath is also studied and collapse and revival behaviors in the entanglement
dynamics are observed. Choosing the equally weighted state and the $W$-class
states as the bath initial states, we finally study the dynamics of
entanglement between two individual bath spins and demonstrate the entanglement
sharing mechanism in such a system.

  Recommendation",,,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Next-basket recommendation (NBR) is prevalent in e-commerce and retail
industry. In this scenario, a user purchases a set of items (a basket) at a
time. NBR performs sequential modeling and recommendation based on a sequence
of baskets. NBR is in general more complex than the widely studied sequential
(session-based) recommendation which recommends the next item based on a
sequence of items. Recurrent neural network (RNN) has proved to be very
effective for sequential modeling and thus been adapted for NBR. However, we
argue that existing RNNs cannot directly capture item frequency information in
the recommendation scenario.
  Through careful analysis of real-world datasets, we find that {\em
personalized item frequency} (PIF) information (which records the number of
times that each item is purchased by a user) provides two critical signals for
NBR. But, this has been largely ignored by existing methods. Even though
existing methods such as RNN based methods have strong representation ability,
our empirical results show that they fail to learn and capture PIF. As a
result, existing methods cannot fully exploit the critical signals contained in
PIF. Given this inherent limitation of RNNs, we propose a simple item frequency
based k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method to directly utilize these critical
signals. We evaluate our method on four public real-world datasets. Despite its
relative simplicity, our method frequently outperforms the state-of-the-art NBR
methods -- including deep learning based methods using RNNs -- when patterns
associated with PIF play an important role in the data.

holes of a broad range of sizes emerges, creating a sponge-like morphology. We
also find that the pressure within rigid structures always exceeds the pressure
outside the rigid structures, i.e. that the backbone is load-bearing. These
findings shows that it is necessary to go beyond mean-field theory to capture
the physics of frictional jamming and also suggests that mechanical stability

scalar-tensor theory coincides with general relativity with a conformally
coupled scalar field (which can be canonical or phantom), therefore the known
solutions of this theory are re-interpreted in terms of HMPG. In particular, in
the case of zero scalar field potential $V (\phi)$, such that both Riemannian
and Palatini Ricci scalars are zero, generic asymptotically flat solutions
either contain naked singularities or describe traversable wormholes, and there
are only special cases of black hole solutions with extremal horizons. There is
also a one-parameter family of solutions with an infinite number of extremal
horizons between static regions. Examples of analytical solutions with nonzero
potentials $V (\phi)$ are also described, among them black hole solutions with
simple horizons which are generic but, for canonical scalars, they require (at
least partly) negative potentials. With phantom scalars there are ``black
universe'' solutions that lead beyond the horizon to an expanding universe

used to locate lightning, which are Magnetic Direction Finder (MDF), Time of

provides researchers with a guide to better understand and progress in this
field. This paper reviews existing approaches used to locate and map lightning
within these three methods. We study the implemented techniques, analyze their
merits and demerits, and sort them in a way that facilitates extracting
opportunities for further improvements. We conclude that for better development
in determining the location and map of lightning, improving the processing of
lightning signals and filtering the associated noise with it is essential. This
includes introducing new processing methods such as wavelet transformation
instead of the traditional cross-correlation. The use of artificial
intelligence may also contribute a lot, particularly deep learning, to
determining the type of lightning, which enables better mapping for the

condition $(T)$ (annealed exponential decay for the unlikely exit probability).
Specifically, we introduce a ballisticity condition which is fulfilled as soon
as a polynomial condition of degree greater than $d-1$ holds. Under that
hypothesis we prove condition $(T)$, which turns this condition into the
weakest-known ballisticity assumption. We recall that standard arguments to
prove that a ballisticity condition implies directional transience require at
least polynomial decay greater than degree $d$. Furthermore, in the one
dimensional case we provide an alternative proof which proves the equivalence
between transient behaviour and annealed arbitrary decay for the unlikely exit

which is modified over time by edge insertions and deletions, maintains an
optimum-height elimination forest. The data structure achieves worst-case
update time $2^{{\cal O}(d^2)}$, which matches the best known parameter
dependency in the running time of a static fpt algorithm for computing the
treedepth of a graph. This improves a result of Dvo\v{r}\'ak et al. [ESA 2014],
who for the same problem achieved update time $f(d)$ for some non-elementary
(i.e. tower-exponential) function $f$. As a by-product, we improve known upper
bounds on the sizes of minimal obstructions for having treedepth $d$ from
doubly-exponential in $d$ to $d^{{\cal O}(d)}$.
  As applications, we design new fully dynamic parameterized data structures
for detecting long paths and cycles in general graphs. More precisely, for a
fixed parameter $k$ and a dynamic graph $G$, modified over time by edge
insertions and deletions, our data structures maintain answers to the following
queries:
  - Does $G$ contain a simple path on $k$ vertices?
  - Does $G$ contain a simple cycle on at least $k$ vertices?
  In the first case, the data structure achieves amortized update time
$2^{{\cal O}(k^2)}$. In the second case, the amortized update time is $2^{{\cal
O}(k^4)} + {\cal O}(k \log n)$. In both cases we assume access to a dictionary
on the edges of $G$.

  Neural Network",,,,,"cs.CL cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Due to the increasing amount of data on the internet, finding a
highly-informative, low-dimensional representation for text is one of the main
challenges for efficient natural language processing tasks including text
classification. This representation should capture the semantic information of
the text while retaining their relevance level for document classification.
This approach maps the documents with similar topics to a similar space in
vector space representation. To obtain representation for large text, we
propose the utilization of deep Siamese neural networks. To embed document
relevance in topics in the distributed representation, we use a Siamese neural
network to jointly learn document representations. Our Siamese network consists
of two sub-network of multi-layer perceptron. We examine our representation for
the text categorization task on BBC news dataset. The results show that the
proposed representations outperform the conventional and state-of-the-art

seen hundreds of au from their driving sources. Accretion and outflow activity
cease with system age, and it is believed that magneto-centrifugally launched
disk winds are critical agents in regulating accretion through the
protoplanetary disk. Protostellar jets are well studied in classical T~Tauri
stars ($M_\star\lesssim2\,M_\odot$), while few nearby ($d\lesssim150\,$pc)
intermediate-mass stars ($M_\star=2-10\,M_\odot$), known as Herbig Ae/Be stars,
have detected jets. We report VLT/MUSE observations of the Herbig~Ae/Be star
HD~100546 and the discovery of a protostellar jet. The jet is similar in
appearance to jets driven by low-mass stars and compares well with the jet of
HD~163296, the only other known optical jet from a nearby Herbig~Ae/Be star. We
derive a (one-sided) mass-loss rate in the jet of $\log \dot{M}_{jet} \sim
-9.5$ (in $M_\odot$\,yr$^{-1}$) and a ratio of outflow to accretion of roughly
$3\times10^{-3}$, which is lower than that of CTTS jets.
  The discovery of the HD~100546 jet is particularly interesting because the
protoplanetary disk around HD~100546 shows a large radial gap, spiral
structure, and might host a protoplanetary system. A bar-like structure
previously seen in H$\alpha$ with VLT/SPHERE shares the jet position angle,
likely represents the base of the jet, and suggests a jet-launching region
within about 2\,au. We conclude that the evolution of the disk at radii beyond
a few au does not affect the ability of the system to launch jets.

during the gradual phase of SOL2017-09-10T16:06 X8.2-class flare. In the EUV
channels starting from the 335 {\AA} one, cool loops appear as dark structures
against the bright loop arcade. These dark structures were precisely coaligned
(spatially and temporally) with loops observed by SST in emission lines of
hydrogen and ionized calcium. Recently published semi-empirical model of cool
loops based on SST observations serves us to predict the level of hydrogen and
helium recombination continua. The continua were synthesized using an
approximate non-LTE approach and theoretical spectra were then transformed to
AIA signals. Comparison with signals detected inside the dark loops shows that
only in AIA 211 {\AA} channel the computed level of recombination continua is
consistent with observations for some models, while in all other channels which
are more distant from the continua edges the synthetic continuum is far too
low. In analogy with on-disk observations of flares we interpret the surplus
emission as due to numerous EUV lines emitted from hot but faint loops in front
of the cool ones. Finally we briefly comment on failure of the standard
absorption model when used for analysis of the dark-loop brightness.

epidemic model, allowing for both short and long-term visitors to the province,
it is studied which features are most influential in determining if such summer

quantum-particle moving in the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) waveguide,
where motion in the transverse direction is confined by a harmonic trapping
potential. Along the waveguide, the particle scatters on an infinite array of
regularized delta potentials. Our starting point is the Lippmann-Schwinger
equation, which for quasi-1D geometry can be solved exactly, based on the
analytical formula for the quasi-1D Green's function. We study the properties
of eigen-energies as a function of particle quasi-momentum, which form band
structure, as in standard Kronig-Penney model. We test our model by comparing
it to the numerical calculations for an atom scattering on an infinite chain of
ions in quasi-1D geometry. The agreement is fairly good and can be further
improved by introducing energy-dependent scattering length in the regularized
delta potential. The energy spectrum exhibits the presence of multiple
overlapping bands resulting from excitations in the transverse direction. At
large lattice constants, our model reduces to standard Kronig-Penney result
with one-dimensional coupling constant for quasi-1D scattering, exhibiting
confinement-induced resonances. In the opposite limit, when lattice constant
becomes comparable to harmonic oscillator length of the transverse potential,
we calculate the correction to the quasi-1D coupling constant due to the
quantum interference between scatterers. Finally, we calculate the effective
mass for the lowest band and show that it becomes negative for large and
positive scattering lengths.

The idea has generated strong interest, but also some controversy due to a lack
of a precise definition, measurement techniques and difficulties to connect
theory to practice. We overcome these drawbacks by proposing an economic
framework based on three key aspects: coalition formation, sustainability and
consistency, meaning that conclusions can be tested by means of logical
deductions and empirical applications. The presence of multiple agents to
create shared value and the optimization of both social and economic criteria
in decision making represent the core of our quantitative definition of shared
value. We also show how economic models can be characterized as shared value
models by means of logical deductions. Summarizing, our proposal builds on the
foundations of shared value to improve its understanding and to facilitate the
suggestion of economic hypotheses, hence accommodating the concept of shared

first measurement of inclusive jet production in peripheral and central Au+Au
collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=200 GeV. Jets are reconstructed with the
anti-k$_{T}$ algorithm using charged tracks with pseudorapidity $|\eta|<1.0$
and transverse momentum $0.2<p_{T,jet}^{ch}<30$ GeV/$c$, with jet resolution
parameter $R$=0.2, 0.3, and 0.4. The large background yield uncorrelated with
the jet signal is observed to be dominated by statistical phase space,
consistent with a previous coincidence measurement. This background is
suppressed by requiring a high-transverse-momentum (high-$p_T$) leading hadron
in accepted jet candidates. The bias imposed by this requirement is assessed,
and the $p_T$ region in which the bias is small is identified. Inclusive
charged-particle jet distributions are reported in peripheral and central Au+Au
collisions for $5<p_{T,jet}^{ch}<25$ GeV/$c$ and $5<p_{T,jet}^{ch}<30$ GeV/$c$,
respectively. The charged-particle jet inclusive yield is suppressed for
central Au+Au collisions, compared to both the peripheral Au+Au yield from this
measurement and to the $pp$ yield calculated using the PYTHIA event generator.
The magnitude of the suppression is consistent with that of inclusive hadron
production at high $p_T$, and that of semi-inclusive recoil jet yield when
expressed in terms of energy loss due to medium-induced energy transport.
Comparison of inclusive charged-particle jet yields for different values of $R$
exhibits no significant evidence for medium-induced broadening of the
transverse jet profile for $R<0.4$ in central Au+Au collisions. The measured
distributions are consistent with theoretical model calculations that
incorporate jet quenching.

zero-range interactions moving in a common `Sinai-type' random environment on a
one dimensional torus. The hydrodynamic equation found is a quasilinear SPDE
with a `rough' random drift term coming from a scaling of the random
environment and a homogenization of the particle interaction. Part of the
motivation for this work is to understand how the space-time limit of the
particle mass relates to that of the known single particle Brox diffusion

balance fidelity in representing their local source distributions against their

For any agent, under Nash equilibrium, the word representing a given partition
region is the conditional expectation of the mixture of local and social source
probability distributions within the region. Since having knowledge of the
original source of information in the network may not be realistic, we show
that under certain conditions, the agents need not know the source origin and
yet still settle on a Nash equilibrium using only the observed sources.
Further, the network may converge to equilibrium through a distributed version
of the Lloyd-Max algorithm. In contrast to traditional results in the evolution
of language, we find several vocabularies may coexist in the Nash equilibrium,
with each individual having exactly one of these vocabularies. The overlap
between vocabularies is high for individuals that communicate frequently and
have similar local sources. Finally, we argue that error in translation along a
chain of communication does not grow if and only if the chain consists of
agents with shared vocabulary. Numerical results are given.

COVID-19 software projects can impact public health policy and user data

researchers improve the quality of COVID-19 software through an empirical study
of open source software projects related to COVID-19. Methodology: We use 129
open source COVID-19 software projects hosted on GitHub to conduct our
empirical study. Next, we apply qualitative analysis on 550 bug reports from
the collected projects to identify bug categories. Findings: We identify 8 bug
categories, which include data bugs i.e., bugs that occur during mining and
storage of COVID-19 data. The identified bug categories appear for 7 categories
of software projects including (i) projects that use statistical modeling to
perform predictions related to COVID-19, and (ii) medical equipment software
that are used to design and implement medical equipment, such as ventilators.
Conclusion: Based on our findings, we advocate for robust statistical model
construction through better synergies between data science practitioners and
public health experts. Existence of security bugs in user tracking software
necessitates development of tools that will detect data privacy violations and
security weaknesses.

to non-uniform coverage planning. This paper considers the variant of

driving statistical inference and rendering better predictive inference at
arbitrary locations for the spatial process. High-dimensional multivariate
spatial data, which is the theme of this article, refers to data sets where the
number of spatial locations and the number of spatially dependent variables is
very large. The field has witnessed substantial developments in scalable models
for univariate spatial processes, but such methods for multivariate spatial
processes, especially when the number of outcomes are moderately large, are
limited in comparison. Here, we extend scalable modeling strategies for a
single process to multivariate processes. We pursue Bayesian inference which is
attractive for full uncertainty quantification of the latent spatial process.
Our approach exploits distribution theory for the Matrix-Normal distribution,

combining the mid-transit times determined from these twelve transit data with

available in the literature, we derive new linear ephemeris and obtain the
timing residuals that suggest the possibility of TTV in TrES-3 system. However,
the frequency analysis shows that the possible TTV is unlikely to be periodic,
indicating the absence of an additional body in this system. To explore the
other possible origins of TTV, the orbital decay and apsidal precession
ephemeris models are fitted to the transit time data. We find decay rate of
TrES-3b to be $\bf \dot{P_q}= -4.1 \pm 3.1$ $ms$ ${yr}^{-1}$ and the
corresponding estimated modified tidal quality factor of ${Q}^{'}_{\ast}$ $\sim
1.11 \times {10}^{5}$ is consistent with the theoretically predicted values for
the stars hosting the hot-Jupiters. The shift in the transit arrival time of
TrES-3b after eleven years is expected to be ${T}_{shift}\sim 69.55 \ s$, which
is consistent with the $RMS$ of the timing residuals. Besides, we find that the
apsidal precession ephemeris model is statistically less probable than the
other considered ephemeris models. It is also discussed that despite the linear
ephemeris model appears to be the most plausible model to represent the transit
time data, the possibility of the orbital decay cannot be completely ruled out
in TrES-3 system. In order to confirm this, further high-precision and
high-cadence follow-up observation of transits of TrES-3b would be important.

a probability distribution over the vertex set. A selection mechanism is
\emph{incentive-compatible} (IC), if the probability assigned to a vertex does
not change when we alter its outgoing edge (or even remove it). The quality of
a selection mechanism is the worst-case ratio between the expected progeny
under the mechanism's distribution and the maximal progeny in the forest. In
this paper we prove an upper bound of 4/5 and a lower bound of $
1/\ln16\approx0.36 $ for the quality of any IC selection mechanism. The lower
bound is achieved by two novel mechanisms and is a significant improvement to
the results of Babichenko et al. (WWW '18). The first, simpler mechanism, has
the nice feature of generating distributions which are fair (i.e., monotone and
proportional). The downside of this mechanism is that it is not exact (i.e.,
the probabilities might sum-up to less than 1). Our second, more involved

algorithms, and has received much attention in both statistics and computer
science. We study a natural model of robustness for high-dimensional
statistical estimation problems that we call the adversarial perturbation
model. An adversary can perturb every sample arbitrarily up to a specified
magnitude $\delta$ measured in some $\ell_q$ norm, say $\ell_\infty$. Our model
is motivated by emerging paradigms such as low precision machine learning and
adversarial training.
  We study the classical problem of estimating the top-$r$ principal subspace
of the Gaussian covariance matrix in high dimensions, under the adversarial
perturbation model. We design a computationally efficient algorithm that given
corrupted data, recovers an estimate of the top-$r$ principal subspace with
error that depends on a robustness parameter $\kappa$ that we identify. This
parameter corresponds to the $q \to 2$ operator norm of the projector onto the
principal subspace, and generalizes well-studied analytic notions of sparsity.
Additionally, in the absence of corruptions, our algorithmic guarantees recover
existing bounds for problems such as sparse PCA and its higher rank analogs. We
also prove that the above dependence on the parameter $\kappa$ is almost
optimal asymptotically, not just in a minimax sense, but remarkably for every
instance of the problem. This instance-optimal guarantee shows that the $q \to
2$ operator norm of the subspace essentially characterizes the estimation error
under adversarial perturbations.

semi-analytical model of galaxy formation {\sc Galform}, embedded in the
high-resolution $N$-body Planck-Millennium simulation, to populate a thousand
halo catalogues generated using the Parallel-PM $N$-body {\sc glam} code. Our
hybrid scheme allows us to make clustering predictions on scales that cannot be

range $z=0.6-1$ from the {\sc Galform} output using similar colour-magnitude
cuts in the $r$, $z$ and $W1$ bands to those that will be applied in the Dark
Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. We find that the LRG-halo
connection is non-trivial, leading to the prediction of a non-standard halo
occupation distribution; in particular, the occupation of central galaxies does
not reach unity for the most massive haloes, and drops with increasing mass.
The {\sc glam} catalogues reproduce the abundance and clustering of the LRGs
predicted by {\sc Galform}, and show good agreement with recent measurements of
the clustering of DESI-like LRGs using photometric redshifts. We use the

concluded that the work that can be extracted from mixing is determined by

that is, the mixing work is a discontinuous function of how similar the gases
are. Here we describe an optomechanical setup that generalises Gibbs' thought
experiment to partially distinguishable quantum gases. Specifically, we model
the interaction between a polarising beamsplitter, that plays the role of a
semi-permeable membrane, and two photon gases of non-orthogonal polarisation.
We find that the work arising from the mixing of the gases is related to the
potential energy associated with the displacement of the microscopic membrane,
and we derive a general quantum mixing work expression, valid for any two
photon gases with the same number distribution. The quantum mixing work is
found to change continuously with the distinguishability of the two polarised
gases. In addition, fluctuations of the work on the microscopic membrane become
important, which we calculate for Fock and thermal states of the photon gases.
Our findings generalise Gibbs' mixing to the quantum regime and open the door
for new quantum thermodynamic (thought) experiments with quantum gases with
non-orthogonal polarisations and microscopic pistons that can distinguish

hashing component generates a hash code directly from an item's content
information (i.e., it generates cold-start and seen item hash codes in the same
manner). This contrasts existing state-of-the-art models, which treat the two

NeuHash-CF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 12\%

effective Floquet-Liouvillian, where the eigenmodes are represented by the
multimode Bogoliubov transformation. Based on the microscopic dynamics, the
nonequilibrium stationary eigenmodes are identified as the eigenmodes with
vanishing values of their imaginary parts due to the balance between the
parametric amplification and dissipation effects. We have found that the
nonlocal stationary eigenmode appears when the mixing between the cavity mode
and the photonic band is caused by the indirect virtual transition, where the
external field frequency to cause the DCE can be largely reduced by using the
finite bandwidth photonic band.

improvement of motor-imagery brain-machine interfaces (MI-BMIs) based on
electroencephalography(EEG). While achieving high classification accuracy, DL
models have also grown in size, requiring a vast amount of memory and
computational resources. This poses a major challenge to an embedded BMI
solution that guarantees user privacy, reduced latency, and low power
consumption by processing the data locally. In this paper, we propose
EEG-TCNet, a novel temporal convolutional network (TCN) that achieves
outstanding accuracy while requiring few trainable parameters. Its low memory
footprint and low computational complexity for inference make it suitable for
embedded classification on resource-limited devices at the edge. Experimental
results on the BCI Competition IV-2a dataset show that EEG-TCNet achieves
77.35% classification accuracy in 4-class MI. By finding the optimal network
hyperparameters per subject, we further improve the accuracy to 83.84%.
Finally, we demonstrate the versatility of EEG-TCNet on the Mother of All BCI
Benchmarks (MOABB), a large scale test benchmark containing 12 different EEG
datasets with MI experiments. The results indicate that EEG-TCNet successfully
generalizes beyond one single dataset, outperforming the current
state-of-the-art (SoA) on MOABB by a meta-effect of 0.25.

Galactic cosmic rays (CRs). We present deep observations of the Galactic Centre
(GC) region with the MAGIC telescopes, which we use for inferring the
underlying CR distribution. Methods: We observed the GC region for
${\approx}100$ hours with the MAGIC telescopes from 2012 to 2017, at high
zenith angles (58-70~deg). This implies a larger energy threshold, but also an
increased effective collection area compared to low zenith observations. Using
new software, we derive instrument response and background models, enabling us
to study the diffuse emission in the region. We use pre-existing data of the
gas distribution in the GC region to derive the underlying distribution of CRs.
Results: We obtain a significant detection for all four model components used
to fit our data (Sgr~A*, ``Arc'', G0.9+0.1, and an extended component for the
Galactic Ridge). We find that the diffuse component is best described as a
power-law with index 2 and an exponential cut-off at around 20~TeV with the
significance of the cut-off being only 2~$\sigma$. The derived cosmic-ray
profile hints to a peak at the GC position, with a measured profile index of
$1.2 \pm 0.3$, supporting the hypothesis of a CR accelerator at the GC. We
argue that the measurements of this profile are presently limited by our
knowledge of the gas distribution in the GC vicinity.

whether there are functions which can only be approximated by sufficiently deep

existing results are limited to depths $2$ and $3$, and achieving results for
higher depths has been an important open question. In this paper, we focus on
feedforward ReLU networks, and prove fundamental barriers to proving such

problem of independent interest: Namely, whether there are polynomially-bounded
functions which require super-polynomial weights in order to approximate with
constant-depth neural networks. We provide a negative and constructive answer
to that question, by showing that if a function can be approximated by a
polynomially-sized, constant depth $k$ network with arbitrarily large weights,
it can also be approximated by a polynomially-sized, depth $3k+3$ network,
whose weights are polynomially bounded.

for static networks, where a sufficient number of measurements could be

generalized LS cost augmented with a proximal-point-type regularization. With
the solution of the regularized LS problem available in closed-form, the online
algorithm is written as a linear dynamical system where the state is updated

chosen to suppress the night-sky OH emission lines, which is critical for
ground-based astronomical telescopes. This type of filter is featured by its
large spectral range, high rejection ratio and narrow notch width.
Traditionally it is only successfully accomplished with fiber Bragg gratings.
The technique we demonstrate here is proven to be very efficient for on-chip
platforms, which can bring many benefits for device footprint, performance and
cost. For the design part, two inverse scattering algorithms are compared, the
frequency domain discrete layer-peeling (f-DLP) and the time domain discrete
layer-peeling (t-DLP). f-DLP is found to be superior for the grating
reconstruction in terms of accuracy and robustness. A method is proposed to
resolve the non-uniformity issue caused by the non-zero layer size in the DLP
algorithm. The designed 55-notch filter is 50-mm-long and implemented on a
compact Si3N4/SiO2 spiral waveguide with a total length of 63 mm.
Experimentally, we demonstrate that the device has a insertion loss as low as
2.5 dB, and that the waveguide propagation loss is as low as 0.10 dB/cm. We are
also able to achieve uniform notch depths and 3-dB widths of about 28 dB and

hierarchical time series. When dealing with hierarchical time series, apart
from generating accurate forecasts, one needs to select a suitable method for
producing reconciled forecasts. Forecast reconciliation is the process of
adjusting forecasts to make them coherent across the hierarchy. In literature,
coherence is often enforced by using a post-processing technique on the base
forecasts produced by suitable time series forecasting methods. On the
contrary, our idea is to use a deep neural network to directly produce accurate
and reconciled forecasts. We exploit the ability of a deep neural network to
extract information capturing the structure of the hierarchy. We impose the
reconciliation at training time by minimizing a customized loss function. In
many practical applications, besides time series data, hierarchical time series
include explanatory variables that are beneficial for increasing the
forecasting accuracy. Exploiting this further information, our approach links
the relationship between time series features extracted at any level of the
hierarchy and the explanatory variables into an end-to-end neural network
providing accurate and reconciled point forecasts. The effectiveness of the
approach is validated on three real-world datasets, where our method
outperforms state-of-the-art competitors in hierarchical forecasting.

end of their second observing run. These mergers have already allowed
constraints to be placed on the population distribution of black holes in the
Universe, which will only improve with more detections and increasing
sensitivity of the detectors. In this paper we develop techniques to measure
the angular distribution of black hole mergers by measuring their statistical
N-point correlations through hierarchical Bayesian inference. We apply it to
the special case of two-point angular correlations using a Legendre polynomial
basis on the sky. Building on the mixture model formalism introduced in Ref.[1]
we show how one can measure two-point correlations with no threshold on
significance, allowing us to target the ensemble of sub-threshold binary black
hole mergers not resolvable with the current generation of ground based
detectors. We also show how one can use these methods to correlate

the context of ultraviolet completion of gravity, endowing a mass to the
graviton and explaining dark energy phenomena. We here construct rotating black
hole solutions in vector-tensor theories valid after the binary neutron star
merger event GW170817 that placed very stringent bound on the propagation speed
of gravitational waves away from the speed of light. Such valid vector-tensor
theories are constructed by performing a generic conformal transformation to
Einstein-Maxwell theory, and the new rotating black hole solutions are
constructed by applying the same conformal transformation to the Kerr-Newman
solution. These theories fall outside of beyond generalized Proca theories but
are within an extended class of vector-tensor theories that satisfy a
degenerate condition to eliminate instability modes and are thus healthy. We
find that such conformal Kerr-Newman solutions preserve the location of the
singularities, event horizons and ergoregion boundary from Kerr-Newman, as well
as the multipole moments and the Petrov type. On the other hand, the
Hamilton-Jacobi equation is no longer separable, suggesting that the
Carter-like constant does not exist in this solution. The standard Newman-Janis
algorithm also does not work to construct the new solutions. We also compute
the epicyclic frequencies, the location of the innermost stable circular
orbits, and the Schwarzschild precession and apply the latter to the recent
GRAVITY measurement to place bounds on the deviations away from Kerr-Newman for
Sgr A$^*$.

interest in recent years. Most of the literature either designs methodology for
a retrospective analysis, where the whole sample is already available when the
statistical inference begins, or considers online detection schemes controlling
the average time until a false alarm. This paper takes a different point of
view and develops monitoring schemes for the online scenario, where high
dimensional data arrives successively and the goal is to detect changes as fast
as possible controlling at the same time the probability of a type I error of a
false alarm. We develop a sequential procedure capable of detecting changes in
the mean vector of a successively observed high dimensional time series with
spatial and temporal dependence. The statistical properties of the method are
analyzed in the case where both, thesample size and dimension tend to infinity.
In this scenario, it is shown that the new monitoring scheme has asymptotic
level alpha under the null hypothesis of no change and is consistent under the
alternative of a change in at least one component of the high dimensional mean
vector. The approach is based on a new type of monitoring scheme for
one-dimensional data which turns out to be often more powerful than the usually
used CUSUM and Page-CUSUM methods, and the component-wise statistics are
aggregated by the maximum statistic. For the analysis of the asymptotic
properties of our monitoring scheme we prove that the range of a Brownian
motion on a given interval is in the domain of attraction of the Gumbel
distribution, which is a result of independent interest in extreme value
theory. The finite sample properties of the new methodology are illustrated by
means of a simulation study and in the analysis of a data example.

VMD enjoys superior mathematical and theoretical framework that makes it robust
to noise and mode mixing. These desirable properties of VMD materialize in
segregation of a major part of noise into a few final modes while majority of
the signal content is distributed among the earlier ones. To exploit this
representation for denoising purpose, we propose to estimate the distribution
of noise from the predominantly noisy modes and then use it to detect and
reject noise from the remaining modes. The proposed approach first selects the
predominantly noisy modes using the CVM measure of statistical distance. Next,
CVM statistic is used locally on the remaining modes to test how closely the
modes fit the estimated noise distribution; the modes that yield closer fit to
the noise distribution are rejected (set to zero). Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method as compared to the state of

develop analytical models of both cases, while remaining in the linear regime,
and introduce noise in the system from two separate sources: thermomechanical

quality factor in the amplitude response, but worsens it in the phase response
on the resonator. In the case of feedback, we find that Q is enhanced in both
cases. Then, we establish a solution for the noisy problem with direct drive

we perform virtual screening of 14010 phytochemicals produced by Indian

cathepsin L. We built a homology model of TMPRSS2 as an experimentally
determined structure is not available. AutoDock Vina was used to perform
molecular docking of phytochemicals against TMPRSS2 model structure and
cathepsin L crystal structure. Potential phytochemical inhibitors were filtered
by comparing their docked binding energies with those of known inhibitors of
TMPRSS2 and cathepsin L. Further, the ligand binding site residues and
non-covalent protein-ligand interactions were used as an additional filter to
identify phytochemical inhibitors that either bind to or form interactions with
residues important for the specificity of the target proteases. We have
identified 96 inhibitors of TMPRSS2 and 9 inhibitors of cathepsin L among
phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants. The top inhibitors of TMPRSS2 are
Edgeworoside C, Adlumidine and Qingdainone, and of cathepsin L is Ararobinol.
Interestingly, several herbal sources of identified phytochemical inhibitors
have antiviral or anti-inflammatory use in traditional medicine. Further in

attracted the attention of researchers. In this paper, we addressed the
multi-label classification of the movie genres in a multimodal way. For this
purpose, we created a dataset composed of trailer video clips, subtitles,
synopses, and movie posters taken from 152,622 movie titles from The Movie
Database. The dataset was carefully curated and organized, and it was also made
available as a contribution of this work. Each movie of the dataset was labeled
according to a set of eighteen genre labels. We extracted features from these
data using different kinds of descriptors, namely Mel Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients, Statistical Spectrum Descriptor , Local Binary Pattern with
spectrograms, Long-Short Term Memory, and Convolutional Neural Networks. The
descriptors were evaluated using different classifiers, such as BinaryRelevance
and ML-kNN. We have also investigated the performance of the combination of
different classifiers/features using a late fusion strategy, which obtained
encouraging results. Based on the F-Score metric, our best result, 0.628, was
obtained by the fusion of a classifier created using LSTM on the synopses, and
a classifier created using CNN on movie trailer frames. When considering the
AUC-PR metric, the best result, 0.673, was also achieved by combining those
representations, but in addition, a classifier based on LSTM created from the
subtitles was used. These results corroborate the existence of complementarity
among classifiers based on different sources of information in this field of

for instance when interventions are in force. This hypothesis, together with
the structure of the set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations
for the populations, allows us to decouple the equations into just two
equations. This further reduces to a logistic type of equation for the total
infected population. The equation can be solved analytically and therefore
allows for a clear interpretation of the growth and inhibiting factors in terms
of the parameters in the full model. The validity of the 'accessible
population' hypothesis and the efficacy of the reduced logistic model is
demonstrated by the ease of fitting the United Kingdom data for the cumulative
infected and daily new infected cases. The model can also be used to forecast
further progression of the disease. In an effort to find optimized parameter
values compatible with the United Kingdom coronavirus data, we first determine
the relative importance of the various transition rates participating in the

very good fit with the United Kingdom data for the cumulative number of

new cases exhibits a turning point, suggests the beginning of a slow-down in
the spread of infections. However, since the rate of slowing down beyond the

saturate to about $3.52 \times 10^5$ around late July, provided the lock-down

are perfect. However, both physical transceiver and RIS suffer from inevitable
hardware impairments in practice, which can lead to severe system performance
degradation and increase the complexity of beamforming optimization.
Consequently, the existing researches on RIS, including channel estimation,
beamforming optimization, spectrum and energy efficiency analysis, etc., cannot
directly apply to the case of hardware impairments. In this paper, by taking
hardware impairments into consideration, we conduct the joint transmit and
reflect beamforming optimization, and reevaluate the system performance. First,
we characterize the closed-form estimators of direct and cascaded channels in
both single-user and multi-user cases, and analyze the impact of hardware
impairments on channel estimation accuracy. Then, the optimal transmit
beamforming solution is derived, and a gradient descent method-based algorithm
is also proposed to optimize the reflect beamforming. Moreover, we analyze the
three types of asymptotic channel capacities with respect to the transmit
power, the antenna number, and the reflecting element number. Finally, in terms
of the system energy consumption, we analyze the power scaling law and the
energy efficiency. Our experimental results also reveal an encouraging
phenomenon that the RIS-assisted wireless system with massive reflecting
elements can achieve both high spectrum and energy efficiency without the need
for massive antennas and without allocating too many resources to optimize the
reflect beamforming.

conversational AI, expects the machine to understand an open-domain natural
language text and thereafter engage in a multi-turn conversation to answer
questions related to the text. While most of the research in Machine Reading
Comprehension (MRC) revolves around single-turn question answering (QA),
multi-turn CMC has recently gained prominence, thanks to the advancement in
natural language understanding via neural language models such as BERT and the
introduction of large-scale conversational datasets such as CoQA and QuAC. The
rise in interest has, however, led to a flurry of concurrent publications, each
with a different yet structurally similar modeling approach and an inconsistent
view of the surrounding literature. With the volume of model submissions to
conversational datasets increasing every year, there exists a need to
consolidate the scattered knowledge in this domain to streamline future
research. This literature review attempts at providing a holistic overview of
CMC with an emphasis on the common trends across recently published models,
specifically in their approach to tackling conversational history. The review
synthesizes a generic framework for CMC models while highlighting the
differences in recent approaches and intends to serve as a compendium of CMC
for future researchers.

with those of the two previous major Coronavirus diseases, i.e. SARS and MERS.
The focus is on the co-occurrence of key-terms, bibliographic coupling and
citation relations of journals and collaborations between countries. Certain
recurring patterns across all three literatures were discovered. All three
outbreaks have commonly generated three distinct and major cohort of studies:
(i) studies linked to the public health response and epidemic control, (ii)
studies associated with the chemical constitution of the virus and (iii)
studies related to treatment, vaccine and clinical care. While studies
affiliated with the category (i) seem to have been the first to emerge, they
overall received least numbers of citations compared to those of the two other
categories. Covid-19 studies seem to have been distributed across a broader
variety of journals and subject areas. Clear links are observed between the
geographical origins of each outbreak or the local geographical severity of
each outbreak and the magnitude of research originated from regions. Covid-19

quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) are observed from BHXRBs, and the dependence
of QPO properties (e.g., phase-lag) on the inclination angle suggests that the

of the X-ray source due to frame-dragging near the spining black hole. Here, in
the scenario of Lense-Thirring precession of the X-ray source, we use a
Monte-Carlo simulation of radiative transfer to study the
irradiation/reflection and the resultant spectral properties including the Fe
K$\alpha$ line, as a function of precession phase (time). We found that the
reflection fraction, i.e., the ratio of the incident flux towards the disk and
the direct flux towards to the observer at infinity, is modulated with the
precession phase, which depends on the truncation radius (i.e., the spectral
state in the truncated disk model) and the inclination angle. The Fe K$\alpha$
line profile also changes as the primary X-ray source precesses, with the line
luminosity and the flux-weighted centroid energy varying with the precession
phase. The periodically modulated 2-10 keV continuum flux could apparently lag
the line luminosity in phase, if the truncation radius is small enough for
Doppler effects due to disk orbital motion to significantly affect the observed

defined for nonasymptotic observer and source by Takizawa et al. [Phys. Rev. D
101, 104032 (2020)] based on the Gauss-Bonnet theorem with using the optical
metric. This lens equation, though it is shown to be equivalent to the Bozza
lens equation[Phys. Rev. D 78, 103005 (2008)], is linear in the deflection
angle. Therefore, the proposed equation is more convenient for the purpose of
doing an iterative analysis. As an explicit example of an asymptotically
nonflat spacetime, we consider a static and spherically symmetric solution in
Weyl conformal gravity, especially a case that $\gamma$ parameter in the Weyl
gravity model is of the order of the inverse of the present Hubble radius. For
this case, we examine iterative solutions for the finite-distance lens equation
up to the third order. The effect of the Weyl gravity on the lensed image
position begins at the third order and it is linear in the impact parameter of
light. The deviation of the lensed image position from the general relativistic
one is $\sim 10^{-2}$ microarcsecond for the lens and source with a separation
angle of $\sim 1$ arcminute, where we consider a cluster of galaxies with
$10^{14} M_{\odot}$ at $\sim 1$ Gpc for instance. The deviation becomes $\sim
10^{-1}$ microarcseconds, even if the separation angle is $\sim 10$ arcminutes.
Therefore, effects of the Weyl gravity model are negligible in current and
near-future observations of gravitational lensing. On the other hand, the
general relativistic corrections at the third order $\sim 0.1$ milliarcseconds
can be relevant with VLBI observations.

(observations in the other class, often called controls). We first derive the
asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the
unknown parameter, which shows that the asymptotic variance convergences to
zero in a rate of the inverse of the number of the events instead of the
inverse of the full data sample size. This indicates that the available
information in rare events data is at the scale of the number of events instead
of the full data sample size. Furthermore, we prove that under-sampling a small
proportion of the nonevents, the resulting under-sampled estimator may have
identical asymptotic distribution to the full data MLE. This demonstrates the
advantage of under-sampling nonevents for rare events data, because this
procedure may significantly reduce the computation and/or data collection
costs. Another common practice in analyzing rare events data is to over-sample
(replicate) the events, which has a higher computational cost. We show that
this procedure may even result in efficiency loss in terms of parameter
estimation.

the shape of the shadow of a spherical black hole is circular in the view of
arbitrary observers, and the size of the shadows tends to be shrunk in the view
of a moving observer. The diameter of the shadows is contracted even in the
direction perpendicular to the observers' motion. This seems not to be

Kerr black holes is dependent on motional status of observers located at finite

convolutional Long-Short Term Memory neural network (ConvLSTM) and
deconvolutional neural network (DeCNN). Flow fields at future time step can be
predicted through flow fields by previous time steps and boundary positions at
those steps by the novel hybrid deep neural network. Unsteady wake flows around
a forced oscillation cylinder with various amplitudes are calculated to
establish the datasets as training samples for training the hybrid deep neural
networks. The trained hybrid deep neural networks are then tested by predicting
the unsteady flow fields around a forced oscillation cylinder with new
amplitude. The effect of neural network structure parameters on prediction
accuracy was analyzed. The hybrid deep neural network, constituted by the best
parameter combination, is used to predict the flow fields in the future time.
The predicted flow fields are in good agreement with those calculated directly
by computational fluid dynamic solver, which means that this kind of deep
neural network can capture accurate spatial-temporal information from the

shows the potential capability of this kind novel hybrid deep neural network in

conversations on social media are essential to advance opinion mining research.
Recently, there is a renewed excitement in the field as we see new models
attempting to improve the state-of-the-art. However, for training and
evaluating the models, the datasets used are often small. Additionally, these
small datasets have uneven class distributions, i.e., only a tiny fraction of
the examples in the dataset have favoring or denying stances, and most other
examples have no clear stance. Moreover, the existing datasets do not
distinguish between the different types of conversations on social media (e.g.,
replying vs. quoting on Twitter). Because of this, models trained on one event
do not generalize to other events.
  In the presented work, we create a new dataset by labeling stance in
responses to posts on Twitter (both replies and quotes) on controversial
issues. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the largest
human-labeled stance dataset for Twitter conversations with over 5200 stance
labels. More importantly, we designed a tweet collection methodology that
favors the selection of denial-type responses. This class is expected to be
more useful in the identification of rumors and determining antagonistic
relationships between users. Moreover, we include many baseline models for
learning the stance in conversations and compare the performance of various
models. We show that combining data from replies and quotes decreases the
accuracy of models indicating that the two modalities behave differently when
it comes to stance learning.

Lorentz-violating part of the theory is described by the term $\lambda (u \cdot
\partial \phi) ^{2}$, where the parameter $\lambda$ and the background vector
$u^{\mu}$ codify the breakdown of Lorentz symmetry. We compute, as a function
of $D$, the Casimir stress by using Green's function techniques for two
specific choices of the vector $u ^{\mu}$. In the timelike case, $u ^{\mu} =
(1,0,...,0)$, the Casimir stress can be factorized as the product of the
Lorentz invariant result times the factor $(1 + \lambda) ^{-1/2}$. For the
radial spacelike case, $u ^{\mu} = (0,1,0,...,0)$, we obtain an analytical
expression for the Casimir stress which nevertheless does not admit a
factorization in terms of the Lorentz invariant result. For the radial
spacelike case we find that there exists a critical value $\lambda _{c} =
\lambda _{c} (D)$ at which the Casimir stress transits from a repulsive
behavior to an attractive one for any $D> 2$. The physically relevant case $D =
3$ is analyzed in detail where the critical value $\lambda _{c}|_{\small D=3} =
0.0025$ was found. As in the Lorentz symmetric case, the force maintains the
divergent behavior at positive even integer values of $D$.

detect input language. We propose an approach that learns and combines acoustic
level representations with embeddings estimated on ASR hypotheses resulting in
up to 50% relative reduction of identification error rate, compared to a model
that uses acoustic only features. Furthermore, to reduce the processing cost
and latency, we exploit a streaming architecture to identify the spoken
language early when the system reaches a predetermined confidence level,
alleviating the need to run multiple ASR systems until the end of input query.
The combined acoustic and text LID, coupled with our proposed streaming runtime
architecture, results in an average of 1500ms early identification for more

improved results by adopting a semi-supervised learning (SSL) technique using

persuasive power of $\textit{ethos}$ -- an individual's ""reputation"" -- using a

containing explicit indicators of successful persuasion. We identify the causal
effect of reputation on persuasion by constructing an instrument for reputation
from a measure of past debate competition, and by controlling for unstructured
argument text using neural models of language in the double machine-learning
framework. We find that an individual's reputation significantly impacts their
persuasion rate above and beyond the validity, strength and presentation of
their arguments. In our setting, we find that having 10 additional reputation
points causes a 31% increase in the probability of successful persuasion over
the platform average. We also find that the impact of reputation is moderated
by characteristics of the argument content, in a manner consistent with a
theoretical model that attributes the persuasive power of reputation to
heuristic information-processing under cognitive overload. We discuss
managerial implications for platforms that facilitate deliberative

results and experimental tests in physics. In this context, quantum
communication complexity (QCC) has recently drawn earnest research attention as
a tool to optimize the amounts of transmitted qubits and energy that are
required to implement distributed computational tasks. On this matter, we
introduce a novel multi-user quantum fingerprinting protocol that is ready to
be implemented with existing technology. Particularly, we extend to the
multi-user framework a well-known two-user coherent-state fingerprinting
scheme. This generalization is highly non-trivial for a twofold reason, as it
requires not only to extend the set of protocol rules but also to specify a
procedure for designing the optical devices intended for the generalized
protocol. Much of the importance of our work arises from the fact that the
obtained QCC figures of merit allow direct comparison with the best-known
classical multi-user fingerprinting protocol, of significance in the field of
computer technologies and networking. Furthermore, as one of the main
contributions of the manuscript, we deduce innovative analytical upper bounds
on the amount of transmitted quantum information that are even valid in the
two-user protocol as a particular case. Ultimately, comparative results are
provided to contrast different protocol implementation strategies and,
importantly, to show that, under realistic circumstances, the multi-user
protocol can achieve tasks that are impossible by using classical communication
alone. Our work provides relevant contributions towards understanding the
nature and the limitations of quantum fingerprinting and, on a broader scope,
also the limitations and possibilities of quantum-communication networks
embracing a node that is accessed by multiple users at the same time.

broad applications in many disciplines and industries. In a large scale
location-based services system, users issue TSP queries concurrently, where a
TSP query is a TSP instance with $n$ points. In the literature, many advanced
TSP solvers are developed to find high-quality solutions. Such solvers can
solve some TSP instances efficiently but may take an extremely long time for
some other instances. Due to the diversity of TSP instances, it is well-known
that there exists no universal best solver dominating all other solvers on all
possible TSP instances. To solve TSP efficiently, in addition to developing new
TSP solvers, it needs to find a per-instance solver for each TSP instance,
which is known as the TSP solver selection problem. In this paper, for the
first time, we propose a deep learning framework, \CTAS, for TSP solver
selection in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, \CTAS exploits deep
convolutional neural networks to extract informative features from TSP
instances and involves data argumentation strategies to handle the scarcity of
labeled TSP instances. Moreover, to support large scale TSP solver selection,
we construct a challenging TSP benchmark dataset with 6,000 instances, which is
known as the largest TSP benchmark. Our \CTAS achieves over 2$\times$ speedup
of the average running time, comparing the single best solver, and outperforms
the state-of-the-art statistical models.

a Brownian motion. Owners can take cash out of the surplus in the form of
""dividends"", subject to transaction costs. However, if the surplus hits 0 then
ruin occurs and the business cannot operate any more.
  We consider two types of dividend distributions: (i) periodic, regular ones
(that is, dividends can be paid only at countable many points in time,
according to a specific arrival process); and (ii) extraordinary dividend
payments that can be made immediately at any time (that is, the dividend
decision time space is continuous and matches that of the surplus process).
Both types of dividends attract proportional transaction costs, and
extraordinary distributions also attracts fixed transaction costs, a realistic
feature. A dividend strategy that involves both types of distributions
(periodic and extraordinary) is qualified as ""hybrid"".
  We determine which strategies (either periodic, immediate, or hybrid) are
optimal, that is, we show which are the strategies that maximise the expected
present value of dividends paid until ruin, net of transaction costs.
Sometimes, a liquidation strategy (which pays out all monies and stops the
process) is optimal. Which strategy is optimal depends on the profitability of
the business, and the level of (proportional and fixed) transaction costs.

second order methods is their heavier per iteration computation and poor
accuracy as compared to first order methods. To address these, we incorporate
several novel approaches in ADAHESSIAN, including: (i) a fast Hutchinson based

(ii) a root-mean-square exponential moving average to smooth out variations of
the Hessian diagonal across different iterations; and (iii) a block diagonal

but it is unclear which relations are causal and which are the result of
another underlying trend. In this series, we quantitatively compare trends
between stellar population properties and galaxy structural parameters in order
to determine which relations are intrinsically tighter, and are therefore more
likely to reflect a causal relation. Specifically, we focus on the galaxy
structural parameters of mass $M$, gravitational potential $\Phi\sim M/R_e$,
and surface mass density $\Sigma\sim M/R_e^2$. In Barone et al. (2018) we found
that for early-type galaxies the age-$\Sigma$ and [Z/H]-$\Phi$ relations show
the least intrinsic scatter as well as the least residual trend with galaxy
size. In this work we study the ages and metallicities measured from full
spectral fitting of 2085 star-forming galaxies from the SDSS Legacy Survey,
selected so all galaxies in the sample are probed to one effective radius. As
with the trends found in early-type galaxies, we find that in star-forming
galaxies age correlates best with stellar surface mass density, and [Z/H]
correlates best with gravitational potential. We discuss multiple mechanisms
that could lead to these scaling relations. For the [Z/H]--$\Phi$ relation we
conclude that gravitational potential is the primary regulator of metallicity,
via its relation to the gas escape velocity. The age--$\Sigma$ relation is
consistent with compact galaxies forming earlier, as higher gas fractions in
the early universe cause old galaxies to form more compactly during their
in-situ formation phase, and may be reinforced by compactness-related quenching
mechanisms.

$(y,0,0)$ at high Reynolds number ${Re}$ in a finite channel $\mathbb{T}\times
[-1,1]\times \mathbb{T}$. It is well known that the plane Couette flow is
linearly stable for any Reynolds number. However, it could become nonlinearly
unstable and transition to turbulence for small but finite perturbations at
high Reynolds number. This is so-called Sommerfeld paradox. One resolution of
this paradox is to study the transition threshold problem, which is concerned
with how much disturbance will lead to the instability of the flow and the
dependence of disturbance on the Reynolds number. This work shows that if the
initial velocity $v_0$ satisfies $\|v_0-(y,0,0)\|_{H^2}\le c_0{Re}^{-1}$ for
some $c_0>0$ independent of $Re$, then the solution of the 3D Navier-Stokes
equations is global in time and does not transition away from the Couette flow
in the $L^\infty$ sense, and rapidly converges to a streak solution for $t\gg
Re^{\frac 13}$ due to the mixing-enhanced dissipation effect. This result
confirms the transition threshold conjecture proposed by Trefethen et
al.(Science, 261(1993), 578-584). To this end, we develop the resolvent
estimate method to establish the space-time estimates for the full linearized
Navier-Stokes system around the flow $(V(t,y,z), 0,0)$, where $V(t,y,z)$ is a
small perturbation(but independent of $Re$) of the Couette flow $y$.

$\alpha>D$. A region of ""collective"" behavior in which optimal squeezing grows

communications including modulation classification and symbol decoding. Many of
the existing end-to-end learning approaches demonstrated robustness to signal
distortions like frequency and timing errors, and outperformed classical signal
processing techniques with sufficient training. However, deep learning
approaches typically require hundreds of thousands of floating points
operations for inference, which is orders of magnitude higher than classical
signal processing approaches and thus do not scale well for long sequences.
Additionally, they typically operate as a black box and without insight on how
their final output was obtained, they can't be integrated with existing
approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture that
combines deep learning with linear signal processing typically done at the
receiver to realize joint modulation classification and symbol recovery. The
proposed method estimates signal parameters by learning and corrects signal
distortions like carrier frequency offset and multipath fading by linear
processing. Using this hybrid approach, we leverage the power of deep learning
while retaining the efficiency of conventional receiver processing techniques
for long sequences. The proposed hybrid approach provides good accuracy in
signal distortion estimation leading to promising results in terms of symbol
error rate. For modulation classification accuracy, it outperforms many state

bodies during planet formation and evolution. As a consequence of these small
impacts, a fraction of the target material escapes from the gravity of the
large body, and a fraction of the impactor material accretes onto the target
surface, depending on the impact velocities and angles. Here, we study the mass
of the high-speed ejecta that escapes from the target gravity by cratering
impacts when material strength is neglected. We perform a large number of
cratering impact simulations onto a planar rocky target using the smoothed
particle hydrodynamics method. We show that the escape mass of the target
material obtained from our numerical simulations agrees with the prediction of
a scaling law under a point-source assumption when $v_{\rm imp} \gtrsim 12
v_{\rm esc}$, where $v_{\rm imp}$ is the impact velocity and $v_{\rm esc}$ is
the escape velocity of the target. However, we find that the point-source
scaling law overestimates the escape mass up to a factor of $\sim 70$,
depending on the impact angle, when $v_{\rm imp} \lesssim 12 v_{\rm esc}$.
Using data obtained from numerical simulations, we derive a new scaling law for
the escape mass of the target material for $v_{\rm imp} \lesssim 12 v_{\rm
esc}$. We also derive a scaling law that predicts the accretion mass of the
impactor material onto the target surface upon cratering impacts by numerically
evaluating the escape mass of the impactor material. Our newly derived scaling
laws are useful for predicting the escape mass of the target material and the
accretion mass of the impactor material for a variety of cratering impacts that
would occur on large planetary bodies during planet formation.

proportion of coral cover, which is a common indicator of coral reef health.
The participants' abilities are expressed in terms of sensitivity and

also incorporates a spatial component, which allows prediction of the latent
variable in locations that have not been surveyed. We show that the model
outperforms traditional weighted-regression approaches used to account for

droplets may have strong utilitarian implications in several scientific and
technological applications. The article reports the control over the
vaporization kinetics of pendent droplets under the influence of competing
internal electrohydrodynamic and ferrohydrodynamic advection. Experimental and
theoretical studies are performed and the morphing of vaporization kinetics of
electrically conducting and paramagnetic fluid droplets using orthogonal
electric and magnetic stimuli is established. Analysis of the observations
reveals that the electric field has a domineering influence compared to the
magnetic field. While the magnetic field is noted to aid the vaporization
rates, the electric field is observed to decelerate the same. Neither the
vapour diffusion dominated kinetics nor the field induced modified surface
tension can explain the observed vaporization behaviours. Velocimetry within
the droplet shows largely modified internal ferro and electrohydrodynamic
advection, which is noted to be the crux of the mechanism towards modified
vaporization rates. A mathematical treatment is proposed and takes into account
the roles played by the governing Hartmann, electrohydrodynamic, interaction,
the thermal and solutal Marangoni, and the electro and magneto Prandtl and
Schmidt numbers. It is observed that the morphing of the thermal and solutal
Marangoni numbers by the electromagnetic interaction number plays the dominant
role towards morphing the advection dynamics. The model is able to predict the
internal advection velocities accurately. The findings may hold significant
promise towards smart control and tuning of vaporization kinetics in
microhydrodynamics transport paradigms.

usability in real-world deployments due to domain gaps and the lack of
annotations for the target domain data. Unsupervised person ReID through domain
adaptation is attractive yet challenging. Existing unsupervised ReID approaches
often fail in correctly identifying the positive samples and negative samples
through the distance-based matching/ranking. The two distributions of distances
for positive sample pairs (Pos-distr) and negative sample pairs (Neg-distr) are
often not well separated, having large overlap. To address this problem, we
introduce a global distance-distributions separation (GDS) constraint over the
two distributions to encourage the clear separation of positive and negative
samples from a global view. We model the two global distance distributions as
Gaussian distributions and push apart the two distributions while encouraging
their sharpness in the unsupervised training process. Particularly, to model
the distributions from a global view and facilitate the timely updating of the
distributions and the GDS related losses, we leverage a momentum update
mechanism for building and maintaining the distribution parameters (mean and
variance) and calculate the loss on the fly during the training.
Distribution-based hard mining is proposed to further promote the separation of
the two distributions. We validate the effectiveness of the GDS constraint in
unsupervised ReID networks. Extensive experiments on multiple ReID benchmark
datasets show our method leads to significant improvement over the baselines
and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

strong, aperiodic variability on time-scales of a few milliseconds to seconds.
The observed light curves display various characteristic features like a
log-normal distribution of flux and a linear rms-flux relation, which indicate
that the underlying variability process is stochastic in nature. It is also
thought to be intrinsic to accretion. This variability has been modelled as
inward propagating fluctuations of mass accretion rate, although the physical
process driving the fluctuations remains puzzling. In this work, we analyse
five exceptionally long duration general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
(GRMHD) simulations of optically thin, geometrically thick, black hole
accretion flows to look for hints of propagating fluctuations in the simulation
data. We find that the accretion profiles from these simulations do show
evidence for inward propagating fluctuations below the viscous frequency by
featuring strong radial coherence and positive time lags when comparing smaller
to larger radii, although these time lags are generally shorter than the
viscous time-scale and frequency independent. Our simulations also support the
notion that the fluctuations in $\dot{M}$ build up in a multiplicative manner,
as the simulations exhibit linear rms-mass flux relations, as well as
log-normal distributions of their mass fluxes. When combining the mass fluxes
from the simulations with an assumed emissivity profile, we additionally find
broad agreement with observed power spectra and time lags, including a recovery
of the frequency dependency of the time lags.

distinct narratives--(i) conspiracy information, whose claims are generally
unsubstantiated and thus referred as misinformation to some extent, and (ii)
scientific information, whose origins are generally readily identifiable and

cascades tend to propagate in a multigenerational branching process while
science cascades are more likely to grow in a breadth-first manner.
Specifically, conspiracy information triggers larger cascades, involves more
users and generations, persists longer, is more viral and bursty than science
information. Content analysis reveals that conspiracy cascades contain more
negative words and emotional words which convey anger, fear, disgust, surprise
and trust. We also find that conspiracy cascades are more concerned with
political and controversial topics. After applying machine learning models, we
achieve an AUC score of nearly 90% in discriminating conspiracy from science
narratives.
  We find that conspiracy cascades are more likely to be controlled by a
broader set of users than science cascades, imposing new challenges on the
management of misinformation. Although political affinity is thought to affect
the consumption of misinformation, there is very little evidence that political
orientation of the information source plays a role during the propagation of
conspiracy information. Our study provides complementing evidence to current
misinformation research and has practical policy implications to stem the
propagation and mitigate the influence of misinformation online.

observe that the linear phenomena of vanishing amplitude, phase singularity,
wavefront dislocation occur simultaneously and a necessary condition for these

matrix configurations generated by the simulation are singular in that the
submatrices representing the expanding 3D space have only two large eigenvalues
associated with the Pauli matrices. This problem was conjectured to occur due
to the approximation used to avoid the sign problem in simulating the model. In
order to confirm this conjecture, the complex Langevin method was applied to
overcome the sign problem instead of using the approximation. The results
indeed showed a clear departure from the Pauli-matrix structure, while the
(3+1)D expanding behavior remained unaltered. It was also found that classical
solutions obtained within a certain ansatz show quite generically a (3+1)D

Comprehensive experimental and theoretical analyses of the droplet evaporation
behaviour for different substrate declination, wettability and temperatures
have been presented. Sessile droplets with substrate declination exhibit
distorted shape and evaporate at different rates compared to droplets on the
same horizontal substrate and is characterized by more often changes in regimes
of evaporation. The slip stick and jump stick modes are prominent during
evaporation. For droplets on inclined substrates, the evaporative flux is also
asymmetric and governed by the initial contact angle dissimilarity. Due to
smaller contact angle at the rear contact line, it is the zone of a higher
evaporative flux. Particle image velocimetry shows the increased internal
circulation velocity within the inclined droplets. Asymmetry in the evaporative
flux leads to higher temperature gradients, which ultimately enhances the
thermal Marangoni circulation near the rear of the droplet where the
evaporative flux is highest. A model is adopted to predict the thermal
Marangoni advection velocity, and good match is obtained. The declination angle
and imposed thermal conditions interplay and lead to morphed evaporation
kinetics than droplets on horizontal heated surfaces. Even weak movements of
the TL alter the evaporation dynamics significantly, by changing the shape of
the droplet from ideally elliptical to almost spherical cap, which ultimately
reduces the evaporative flux. The life time of the droplet is modelled by
modifying available models for non-heated substrate, to account for the shape
asymmetry. The present findings may find strong implications towards microscale
thermo-hydrodynamics.

transfer in binary stars can change the evolutionary path and fate of the
corresponding objects relative to what is expected from single stellar
evolution. What is the critical mass ratio at which unstable mass transfer
occurs is an unsolved fundamental problem in binary evolution. To resolve this
issue, we construct the thermal equilibrium mass loss model and derive critical
mass ratios for both thermal timescale mass transfer and unstable mass
transfer, the latter of which occurs when the outer Lagrangian point, L2, is
overfilled. Using several 3.2 Msun stellar models as examples, we study the
stellar response to thermal equilibrium mass loss and present the thresholds
for thermal timescale mass transfer. We study the possible mass transfer
channels of binary systems containing a 3.2 Msun donor star, taking into
account thermal timescale mass transfer, unstable mass transfer through L2, and
dynamical timescale mass transfer. We repeat this simulation for a grid of
donor stars with different masses (from 0.1 to 100 Msun with Z = 0.02) and at
different evolutionary stages, and present our results. The results show that
unstable mass transfer due to the overfilling of the outer Lagrangian point may
also play an essential role in the formation of common envelopes for late red

classification, that is assigning one of a discrete set of labels to each task.
Recently, however, more complex tasks have been attempted including asking

this involves the use of crowdsourcing for function estimation. We are
motivated by this problem to drive applications such as collaborative

alleviating overfitting, a typical impediment to accurate prediction models in

Recognition (ASR) of code-switched speech, leading to gains in accuracy on
code-switched datasets in many language pairs. Code-switched speech co-occurs
with monolingual speech in one or both languages being mixed. In this work, we
show that fine-tuning ASR models on code-switched speech harms performance on
monolingual speech. We point out the need to optimize models for code-switching
while also ensuring that monolingual performance is not sacrificed. Monolingual
models may be trained on thousands of hours of speech which may not be
available for re-training a new model. We propose using the Learning Without
Forgetting (LWF) framework for code-switched ASR when we only have access to a
monolingual model and do not have the data it was trained on. We show that it
is possible to train models using this framework that perform well on both
code-switched and monolingual test sets. In cases where we have access to
monolingual training data as well, we propose regularization strategies for
fine-tuning models for code-switching without sacrificing monolingual accuracy.
We report improvements in Word Error Rate (WER) in monolingual and
code-switched test sets compared to baselines that use pooled data and simple
fine-tuning.

  Srivastava","Distributed Bayesian Varying Coefficient Modeling Using a Gaussian
  Process Prior",,,,,"stat.ME stat.CO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Varying coefficient models (VCMs) are widely used for estimating nonlinear
regression functions for functional data. Their Bayesian variants using
Gaussian process priors on the functional coefficients, however, have received
limited attention in massive data applications, mainly due to the prohibitively
slow posterior computations using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms.
We address this problem using a divide-and-conquer Bayesian approach. We first
create a large number of data subsamples with much smaller sizes. Then, we
formulate the VCM as a linear mixed-effects model and develop a data
augmentation algorithm for obtaining MCMC draws on all the subsets in parallel.
Finally, we aggregate the MCMC-based estimates of subset posteriors into a
single Aggregated Monte Carlo (AMC) posterior, which is used as a
computationally efficient alternative to the true posterior distribution.
Theoretically, we derive minimax optimal posterior convergence rates for the
AMC posteriors of both the varying coefficients and the mean regression
function. We provide quantification on the orders of subset sample sizes and
the number of subsets. The empirical results show that the combination schemes
that satisfy our theoretical assumptions, including the AMC posterior, have
better estimation performance than their main competitors across diverse
simulations and in a real data analysis.

combinations of twist angle and doping where they can be placed at the Fermi

it is difficult to apply optimization-based EMS to current in-use EREVs because
insufficient knowledge is known about future trips, and because such methods
are computationally expensive for large-scale deployment. As a result, most
past research has been validated on standard driving cycles or on recorded
high-resolution data from past real driving cycles. This paper improves an
in-use rule-based EMS that is used in a delivery vehicle fleet equipped with
two-way vehicle-to-cloud connectivity. A physics model-guided online Bayesian
framework is described and validated on large number of in-use driving samples
of EREVs used for last-mile package delivery. The framework includes: a
database, a preprocessing module, a vehicle model and an online Bayesian
algorithm module. It uses historical 0.2 Hz resolution trip data as input and
outputs an updated parameter to the engine control logic on the vehicle to
reduce fuel consumption on the next trip. The key contribution of this work is
a framework that provides an immediate solution for fuel use reduction of
in-use EREVs. The framework was also demonstrated on real-world EREVs delivery
vehicles operating on actual routes. The results show an average of 12.8% fuel
use reduction among tested vehicles for 155 real delivery trips. The presented
framework is extendable to other EREV applications including passenger

light-cone structure, it has remained elusive how this influences the

Concretely, we focus on the Rindler space describing the spacetime in close
vicinity to a black hole. As a main result we find that entanglement grows
sublinearly in a generic fashion both for interacting and noninteracting
quantum matter. We further observe that the asymptotic relaxation becomes
exponential, as opposed to algebraic for planar Minkowski spacetimes, and that
in the vicinity of the black hole the relaxation time for large subsystems
becomes independent of the subsystem size. We study entanglement dynamics both
for the case of noninteracting fermions, allowing for exact numerical
solutions, and for random unitary circuits representing a paradigmatic class of

identified the central players in the social network built from the competitive
player-vs-player (PvP) multiplayer (Crucible) matches in the online shooter
Destiny. Then, we computed influence scores for each player evaluating the
increase in similarity over time between two connected individuals. In this
paper, we were able to show the first indications that the traditional metrics
for influencers do not necessarily apply for games. On the contrary, we found
that the group of central players was distinct from the group of influential
players, defined as the individuals with the highest influence scores. Then, we
provide an analysis of the two groups.

path time between states has only recently received attention. Transition paths
between different energy levels are expected to be indistinguishable in shape
and have equal uphill and downhill lengths. This fundamental symmetry often
prevents directional sensing in experiments. Here, we report experimental
evidence for transition path time symmetry and its breakdown on the
single-molecule and mesoscale. In automated Brownian dynamics experiments, we
establish first-passage time symmetries of colloids driven by femtoNewton-range
forces in holographically-created optical landscapes confined in microchannels.
Conversely, we show that transitions which couple in a path-dependent manner to
fluctuating forces exhibit asymmetry. We reproduce this asymmetry in folding
transitions of DNA-hairpins driven out of equilibrium and suggest a topological
mechanism for the symmetry breakdown. Our results can reveal directionality in
molecular transitions or translocations through membrane channels and

  Banach spaces","Revised following the suggestions of a referee",,,,"math.FA math.GN math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  For a Banach space $X$ its subset $Y\subseteq X$ is called overcomplete if
$|Y|=dens(X)$ and $Z$ is linearly dense in $X$ for every $Z\subseteq Y$ with
$|Z|=|Y|$. In the context of nonseparable Banach spaces this notion was
introduced recently by T. Russo and J. Somaglia but overcomplete sets have been
considered in separable Banach spaces since the 1950ties.
  We prove some absolute and consistency results concerning the existence and
the nonexistence of overcomplete sets in some classical nonseparable Banach
spaces. For example: $c_0(\omega_1)$, $C([0,\omega_1])$,
$L_1(\{0,1\}^{\omega_1})$, $\ell_p(\omega_1)$, $L_p(\{0,1\}^{\omega_1})$ for
$p\in (1, \infty)$ or in general WLD Banach spaces of density $\omega_1$ admit
overcomplete sets (in ZFC). The spaces $\ell_\infty$, $\ell_\infty/c_0$, spaces
of the form $C(K)$ for $K$ extremally disconnected, superspaces of
$\ell_1(\omega_1)$ of density $\omega_1$ do not admit overcomplete sets (in
ZFC). Whether the Johnson-Lindenstrauss space generatedin $\ell_\infty$ by
$c_0$ and the characteristic functions of elements of an almost disjoint family
of subsets of $\mathbb N$ of cardinality $\omega_1$ admits an overcomplete set
is undecidable. The same refers to all nonseparable Banach spaces with the dual
balls of density $\omega_1$ which are separable in the weak$^*$ topology. The
results proved refer to wider classes of Banach spaces but several natural open
questions remain open.

  Surface-Contact Area of Polymer-Filler Interface",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.chem-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In this article we discuss in detail the effective approaches to enhance the
thermal conductivity in polymer composites. It is shown from numerical
simulations that maximizing interfacial area between filler and polymer
enhances very significantly the effective thermal conductivity in composites.
Our study outlines two main facts. (a) Although the nature of the filler's
geometry plays an important role in the effective thermal conductivity, we show
that among the different geometries thermal conductivity is high for those
geometries for which the ratio of surface-area to volume is high. Thus
non-spherical shaped fillers show high thermal conductivity compared to the
spherical fillers. (b) For fillers of a particular geometry, by maximizing its
surface area without changing the volume fraction of the metallic filler, the
effective thermal conductivity increases. Thus, the interfacial area between
filler and polymer plays an important role in the enhancement of thermal
conductivity. Maximizing interfaces facilitates more routes for heat conduction
through the metallic filler. Thus filler material can be transformed to result
into more surface such that more interfaces between the filer polymer can be
obtained. It is also observed that as this interfacial area increases, increase
in effective thermal conductivity follows from linear to the logarithmic
growth. It should be noted that to inherit the polymer properties there is a
restriction on the upper bound of volume fraction of the fillers. The current
study bring out an important step in this direction. Our results are
technologically very important in designing composite polymers for better heat
conduction, and are very cost-effective. This study also provides a connection
between the bulk and the surface area in effectively determination of the
thermal conductivity.

employed to allow solar-powered UAVs to capture the dynamics of harvested and

it is used to compute the probability of ruin of the UAVs. The probability of
ruin denotes the vulnerability of draining out the power of a UAV. Next, the
probability of ruin is used for efficient user association with each UAV. Then,
power allocation for 5G NR applications is performed to maximize the achievable

has provided an essential alternate to explore regions where other optical
sensors lack in capturing interpretable signals. A thermal camera captures an
image using the heat difference emitted by objects in the infrared spectrum,
and object detection in thermal images becomes effective for autonomous driving
in challenging conditions. Although object detection in the visible spectrum
domain imaging has matured, thermal object detection lacks effectiveness. A
significant challenge is scarcity of labeled data for the thermal domain which
is desiderata for SOTA artificial intelligence techniques. This work proposes a
domain adaptation framework which employs a style transfer technique for
transfer learning from visible spectrum images to thermal images. The framework
uses a generative adversarial network (GAN) to transfer the low-level features
from the visible spectrum domain to the thermal domain through style
consistency. The efficacy of the proposed method of object detection in thermal
images is evident from the improved results when used styled images from
publicly available thermal image datasets (FLIR ADAS and KAIST Multi-Spectral).

years have seen a paradigm shift in personal mobile devices, from smartphones
towards wearable devices. Wearable devices come in many different forms
targeting different application scenarios. Among these, the fitness wearable
devices (FWDs) are proven to be one of the forms that intrigue the market and
occupy an increasing trend in terms of the market share. Nevertheless, although
the fitness wearable devices nowadays are functionally self-contained based on
the advanced sensor, computation, and communicative technologies, there is
still a large gap to truly satisfy the target customer group, i.e., accessible
to and usable by a larger quantity of users. This fuels the research area on
applying the universal design principles to fitness wearable devices. In this
survey, we first present the background of FWDs and show the acceptance and
adaption challenges of the corresponding user groups. We then review the
universal design principle and how it and its relative approaches could be used
in FWDs. Further, we collect the available FWDs that bear the universal design
principles in their development circles. Last, we open up the discussion based
on the surveyed literature and provide the insight of potential future work.

resolve rotational ambiguity, which combined with the robust geometric and
topological false positive rejection, allows all marker bits to be used for
data.
  When compared to existing state-of-the-art square binary markers (AprilTag)

126 thousand times the dictionary size of AprilTag 41h12 while simultaneously

algebraically with $SU(P)_L$ similar to the electric charge $Q$, which all lead
to a $SU(3)_C\otimes SU(P)_L\otimes U(1)_X\otimes U(1)_N$ gauge completion,
where $X$ and $N$ determine $Q$ and $B-L$, respectively. As a direct result,
the neutrinos obtain appropriate masses via a canonical seesaw. While the
version with $P=3$ supplies the schemes of single-component dark matter well
established in the literature, we prove in this work that the models with
$P\geq 4$ provide the novel scenarios of multicomponent dark matter, which
contain simultaneously at least $P-2$ stable candidates, respectively. In this
setup, the multicomponet dark matter is nontrivially unified with normal matter
by gauge multiplets, and their stability is ensured by a residual gauge
symmetry which is a remnant of the gauge symmetry after spontaneous symmetry
breaking. The three versions with $P=4$ according to the new lepton electric
charges are detailedly investigated. The mass spectrum of the scalar sector is
diagonalized when the scale of the $U(1)_N$ breaking is much higher than that
of the usual 3-4-1 symmetry breaking. All the interactions of gauge bosons with

perform an extensive suite of binary population synthesis simulations evolving
massive systems to determine the assumptions and parameters which most impact
the ejection rate of fast stars. In a simulation tailored to eject fast stars,
we find the most likely hyper-runaway star progenitor binary is composed of a
massive ($\sim$$30\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$) primary and a
$\sim$$3-4\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ companion on an orbital period that shrinks to
$\lesssim$1 day prior to the core collapse following a common envelope phase.
The black hole remnant formed from the primary must receive a natal kick
$\gtrsim$1000 $\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ to disrupt the binary and eject the
companion at a large velocity. We compare the fast stars produced in these
simulations to a contemporary census of early-type Milky Way hyper-runaway star
candidates. We find that these rare objects may be produced in sufficient
number only when poorly-constrained binary evolution parameters related to the
strength of post-core collapse remnant natal kicks and common envelope
efficiency are adjusted to values currently unsupported -- but not excluded --

external inputs, either known (such as control actions) or unknown
(disturbances). Inputs of unknown magnitude are especially detrimental for
observability, and they also complicate its analysis. Hence the availability of
computational tools capable of analysing the observability of nonlinear systems
with unknown inputs has been limited until lately. Two symbolic algorithms
based on differential geometry, ORC-DF and FISPO, have been recently proposed
for this task, but their critical analysis and comparison is still lacking.
Here we perform an analytical comparison of both algorithms and evaluate their
performance on a set of problems, discussing their strengths and limitations.
Additionally, we use these analyses to provide insights about certain aspects
of the relationship between inputs and observability. We find that, while
ORC-DF and FISPO follow a similar approach, they differ in key aspects that can
have a substantial influence on their applicability and computational cost. The
FISPO algorithm is more generally applicable, since it can analyse any
nonlinear ODE model. The ORC-DF algorithm analyses models that are affine in
the inputs, and if those models have known inputs it is sometimes more
efficient. Thus, the optimal choice of a method depends on the characteristics
of the problem under consideration. To facilitate the use of both algorithms we
implement the ORC-DF algorithm in a new version of STRIKE-GOLDD, a MATLAB
toolbox for structural identifiability and observability analysis. Since this
software tool already had an implementation of the FISPO algorithm, the new
release allows modellers and model users the convenience of choosing between
different algorithms in a single tool, without changing the coding of their

Moreover, the harmonic yield in the second plateau is significantly enhanced by
increases in the wavelength of the driving laser. Owing to the confined

molecular system requires the experimental determination of its possible
states, their populations and the respective interconversion rates.
Well-established methods can incorporate in molecular dynamics simulations
experimental information about states using structural restraints, and about
populations using thermodynamic restraints. However, it is still unclear how to
include experimental knowledge of interconversion rates. Here we introduce a
method of imposing known rate constants as constraints in molecular dynamics
simulations, which is based on a combination of the maximum entropy and maximum
caliber principles. Starting from an existing ensemble of trajectories,
obtained from either molecular dynamics or enhanced trajectory sampling, this
method provides a minimally perturbed path distribution consistent with the
kinetic constraints, as well as a modified free energy and committor landscape.
We illustrate the application of the method to simple toy systems, as well as
to all atom molecular simulations of peptide association and folding. We find
that by combining experimental rate coefficient data and molecular dynamics
simulations we are able to determine new transition states, reaction mechanisms
and free energies. For instance, in the case of chignolin protein folding we
find that imposing a slower folding rate shifts the transition state to more
native like conformations, while it increases the stability of the unfolded
region.

boundary value problems, in the broader class of unfitted/embedded/immersed
methods. It has proven to be quite efficient in handling problems with complex
geometries, ranging from Poisson to Darcy, from Navier-Stokes to elasticity and
beyond. The key feature of the SBM is a {\it shift} in the location where
Dirichlet boundary conditions are applied - from the true to a surrogate
boundary - and an appropriate modification (again, a {\it shift}) of the value
of the boundary conditions, in order to reduce the consistency error. In this
paper we provide a sound analysis of the method in smooth and non-smooth
domains, highlighting the influence of geometry and distance between exact and
surrogate boundaries upon the convergence rate. Without loss of generality, we
consider the Poisson problem with Dirichlet boundary conditions as a model and
we first detail a procedure to obtain the crucial shifting between the
surrogate and the true boundaries. Next, we give a sufficient condition for the
well-posedness and stability of the discrete problem. The behavior of the
consistency error arising from shifting the boundary conditions is thoroughly
analyzed, for smooth boundaries and for boundaries with corners and edges. The
convergence rate is proven to be optimal in the energy norm, and is further
enhanced in the $L^2$-norm.

photometry for all objects in the sample, confirming most of the trends
previously observed in the much smaller 20 pc sample. Local white dwarfs are
overwhelmingly consistent with Galactic disc kinematics, with only four halo
candidates. We find that DAZ white dwarfs are significantly less massive than
the overall DA population ($\overline{M}_\mathrm{DAZ} =
0.59\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $\overline{M}_\mathrm{DA} = 0.66\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$).
It may suggest that planet formation is less efficient at higher mass stars,
producing more massive white dwarfs. We detect a sequence of crystallised white
dwarfs in the mass range from $0.6\ \lesssim M/\mathrm{M}_\odot \lesssim\

kinematic properties that correspond to the average of the sample, suggesting
that their nature can be explained by crystallisation alone. We also detect 56

the model is highly biased towards the downstream task, it losses its
generalisation capability which directly benefits the downstream job but the

we propose a new autoencoder based model named ""Guided Adversarial Autoencoder

existing works use Euclidean metric based constraints to resolve the
discrepancy between features of images from different modalities. However,
these methods are incapable of learning angularly discriminative feature
embedding because Euclidean distance cannot measure the included angle between
embedding vectors effectively. As an angularly discriminative feature space is
important for classifying the human images based on their embedding vectors, in
this paper, we propose a novel ranking loss function, named Bi-directional
Exponential Angular Triplet Loss, to help learn an angularly separable common
feature space by explicitly constraining the included angles between embedding
vectors. Moreover, to help stabilize and learn the magnitudes of embedding
vectors, we adopt a common space batch normalization layer. The quantitative

the hadronic origin of the gamma-ray emission. The total cosmic-ray (CR) proton

gamma-rays from Cygnus cocoon, Westerlund 1, Westerlund 2, NGC 3603, and 30 Dor

goals observed during that trajectory. We use this to train an ensemble of
conditional generative models (GANs) to generate plausible trajectories that
lead the agent from its current state towards a specified goal. We then combine
these imagined trajectories into a novel planning algorithm in order to achieve
the desired goal as efficiently as possible. The performance of PlanGAN has

Hindsight Experience Replay. Our studies indicate that PlanGAN can achieve

To obtain a handle on the robustness of the ages for these stars, we first
study the dependencies of seismic ages on three model input parameters. We find
that inferred ages do not change systematically with the helium fraction (Y) or
the mixing-length parameter but depend strongly on the metallicity ([M/H]) of
the model. The results indicate that age estimates of subgiants have less model
dependence and hence are more reliable than those of main-sequence stars or red
giants. We then model individual oscillation frequencies of the same 36 Kepler
subgiants, using observed metallicities, and obtain their ages with an average
precision of ~15%. The comparison with previous age estimates with different
stellar codes or input physics shows good agreement (mostly within 2#). We
hence suggest that seismology-determined ages of subgiants are not greatly
model-dependent.

Burer-Monteiro factorization in solving the SDP relaxation by analyzing its

ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) in the presence of decoding

over a binary-input AWGN channel and decoded with order-statistic (OS) decoder.
We first investigate the performance of OS decoders as a function of decoding
complexity and propose an empirical model that accurately quantifies the
corresponding trade-off. Next, a consistent way to compute the aggregate
latency for complexity constrained receivers is presented, where the latency
due to decoding is also included. It is shown that, with strict latency
requirements, decoding latency cannot be neglected in complexity constrained
receivers. Next, based on the proposed model, several optimization problems,
relevant to the design of URLLC systems, are introduced and solved. It is shown
that the decoding time has a drastic effect on the design of URLLC systems when
constraints on decoding complexity are considered. Finally, it is also
illustrated that the proposed model can closely describe the performance versus
complexity trade-off for other candidate coding solutions for URLLC such as
tail-biting convolutional codes, polar codes, and low-density parity-check
codes.

realized a large photon acceptance and good timing resolution. Low

synthesized using low-radioactive-contamination material; (2) the photocathode

investigate the influence of sub-grid baryon physics on halo-scale inflow,
specifically the consequences of modelling radiative cooling, as well as
feedback from stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We find that variations
in halo baryon fractions at fixed mass (particularly their circum-galactic
medium gas content) are very well correlated with variations in the baryon
fraction of accreting matter, which we show to be heavily suppressed by stellar
feedback in low-mass haloes, $M_{\rm halo}\lesssim10^{11.5}M_{\odot}$. Breaking
down accretion rates into first infall, recycled, transfer and merger
components, we show that baryons are much more likely to be smoothly accreted
than to have originated from mergers when compared to DM, finding (averaged
across halo mass) a merger contribution of $\approx6\%$ for baryons, and
$\approx15\%$ for DM at $z\approx0$. We also show that the breakdown of inflow
into different channels is strongly dependent on sub-grid physics, particularly
the contribution of recycled accretion (accreting matter that has been
previously ejected from progenitor haloes). Our findings highlight the dual

prevalent throughout the sciences. It is often the case that the governing

prescribed, while the emergent slow scale evolution is unknown. Yet the
course-grained, slow scale dynamics is often of greatest interest in practice.
In this work we present an accurate and efficient method for extracting the
slow timescale dynamics from signals exhibiting multiple timescales that are
amenable to averaging. The method relies on tracking the signal at
evenly-spaced intervals with length given by the period of the fast timescale,
which is discovered using clustering techniques in conjunction with the dynamic
mode decomposition. Sparse regression techniques are then used to discover a
mapping which describes iterations from one data point to the next. We show
that for sufficiently disparate timescales this discovered mapping can be used
to discover the continuous-time slow dynamics, thus providing a novel tool for
extracting dynamics on multiple timescales.

installation of 5G next-generation Node-B Base Stations (gNBs) over the
territory and the wide adoption of 5G User Equipment (UE). In this context, the
population is concerned about the potential health risks associated with the
Radio Frequency (RF) emissions from 5G equipment, with several communities
actively working toward stopping the 5G deployment. To face these concerns, in
this work, we analyze the health risks associated with 5G exposure by adopting
a new and comprehensive viewpoint, based on the communications engineering
perspective. By exploiting our background, we analyze the alleged health
effects of 5G exposure and critically review the latest works that are often
referenced to support the health concerns from 5G. We then precisely examine
the up-to-date metrics, regulations, and assessment of compliance procedures
for 5G exposure, by evaluating the latest guidelines from IEEE, ICNIRP, ITU,
IEC, and FCC, as well as the national regulations in more than 220 countries.
We also thoroughly analyze the main health risks that are frequently associated
with specific 5G features (e.g., MIMO, beamforming, cell densification,
adoption of millimeter waves, and connection of millions of devices). Finally,
we examine the risk mitigation techniques based on communications engineering
that can be implemented to reduce the exposure from 5G gNB and UE. Overall, we
argue that the widely perceived health risks that are attributed to 5G are not
supported by scientific evidence from communications engineering. In addition,
we explain how the solutions to minimize the health risks from 5G are already
mature and ready to be implemented. Finally, future works, e.g., aimed at
evaluating long-term impacts of 5G exposure, as well as innovative solutions to
further reduce the RF emissions, are suggested.

information between orbitals as a major descriptor of electronic structure.
This has already facilitated remarkable improvements of numerical methods and
may lead to a more comprehensive foundation for chemical bonding theory.
Building on this promising development, our work provides a refined discussion
of quantum information theoretical concepts by introducing the physical
correlation and its separation into classical and quantum parts as distinctive
quantifiers of electronic structure. In particular, we succeed in quantifying
the entanglement. Intriguingly, our results for different molecules reveal that
the total correlation between orbitals is mainly classical, raising questions
about the general significance of entanglement in chemical bonding. Our work
also shows that implementing the fundamental particle number superselection
rule, so far not accounted for in quantum chemistry, removes a major part of
correlation and entanglement previously seen. In that respect, realizing
quantum information processing tasks with molecular systems might be more
challenging than anticipated.

Autonomous vehicles (AVs) correspondingly face the need to predict pedestrians'
future trajectories in these same environments. Traditional model-based
prediction methods have been limited to making predictions in highly structured
scenes with signalized intersections, marked crosswalks, or curbs. Deep
learning methods have instead leveraged datasets to learn predictive features
that generalize across scenes, at the cost of model interpretability. This
paper aims to achieve both widely applicable and interpretable predictions by
proposing a risk-based attention mechanism to learn when pedestrians yield, and
a model of vehicle influence to learn how yielding affects motion. A novel
probabilistic method, Off the Sidewalk Predictions (OSP), uses these to achieve
accurate predictions in both shared spaces and traditional scenes. Experiments
on urban datasets demonstrate that the realtime method achieves
state-of-the-art performance.

of the Sun from the William Herschel Telescope and Gran Telescopio Canarias.
All candidates were selected from $\textit{Gaia}$ Data Release 2 (DR2) and in
almost all cases had no prior spectroscopic classifications. We find a total of
191 confirmed white dwarfs and 39 main-sequence star contaminants. The majority
of stellar remnants in the sample are relatively cool ($\langle T_{\rm eff}
\rangle$ = 6200 K), showing either hydrogen Balmer lines or a featureless
spectrum, corresponding to 89 DA and 76 DC white dwarfs, respectively. We also
recover two DBA white dwarfs and 9--10 magnetic remnants. We find two
carbon-bearing DQ stars and 14 new metal-rich white dwarfs. This includes the
possible detection of the first ultra-cool white dwarf with metal lines. We
describe three DZ stars for which we find at least four different metal
species, including one which is strongly Fe- and Ni-rich, indicative of the
accretion of a planetesimal with core-Earth composition. We find one extremely
massive (1.31 $\pm$ 0.01 M$_{\odot}$) DA white dwarf showing weak Balmer lines,
possibly indicating stellar magnetism. Another white dwarf shows strong Balmer
line emission but no infrared excess, suggesting a low-mass sub-stellar
companion. High spectroscopic completeness ($>$99%) has now been reached for
$\textit{Gaia}$ DR2 sources within 40 pc sample, in the northern hemisphere
($\delta >$ 0 deg) and located on the white dwarf cooling track in the

able to find low-dimensional projections that fairly capture the correlations
among the multiple views that characterise each datum. On the other hand,
high-dimensionality and non-linear issues are traditionally handled by kernel
methods, inducing a (non)-linear function between the latent projection and the
data itself. However, they usually come with scalability issues and exposition
to overfitting. Here, we propose merging both approaches into single model so
that we can exploit the best features of multi-view latent models and kernel
methods and, moreover, overcome their limitations.
  In particular, we combine probabilistic factor analysis with what we refer to
as kernelized observations, in which the model focuses on reconstructing not
the data itself, but its relationship with other data points measured by a
kernel function. This model can combine several types of views (kernelized or
not), and it can handle heterogeneous data and work in semi-supervised
settings. Additionally, by including adequate priors, it can provide compact
solutions for the kernelized observations -- based in a automatic selection of
Bayesian Relevance Vectors (RVs) -- and can include feature selection
capabilities. Using several public databases, we demonstrate the potential of
our approach (and its extensions) w.r.t. common multi-view learning models such

Here I discuss it in the context of engineering systems and biology, where
strong emergence takes place due to a combination of upwards emergence and
downwards causation [Ellis 2020]. Firstly, I show that causal closure is
strictly limited in terms of spatial interactions because these are cases that
are of necessity strongly interacting with the environment. Effective Spatial
Closure holds ceteris parabus, and can be violated by Black Swan Events.
Secondly, I show that causal closure in the hierarchy of emergence is a
strictly interlevel affair, and in the cases of engineering and biology
encompasses all levels from the social level to the particle physics level.
However Effective Causal Closure can usefully be defined for a restricted set
of levels, and one can experimentally determine Effective Theories that hold at
each level. This does not however imply those effective theories are causally
complete by themselves. In particular, the particle physics level is not
causally complete by itself in the contexts of solid state physics (because of
interlevel wave-particle duality), digital computers (where algorithms
determine outcomes), or biology (because of time dependent constraints).
Furthermore Inextricably Intertwined Levels occur in all these contexts.

advances. However, these advances have often come at the cost of both increased
scale in the underlying architectures being trained as well as increased
complexity of the RL algorithms used to train them. These increases have in
turn made it more difficult for researchers to rapidly prototype new ideas or
reproduce published RL algorithms. To address these concerns this work
describes Acme, a framework for constructing novel RL algorithms that is
specifically designed to enable agents that are built using simple, modular
components that can be used at various scales of execution. While the primary
goal of Acme is to provide a framework for algorithm development, a secondary
goal is to provide simple reference implementations of important or

task in cranioplasty operations. The system is currently integrated in
Studierfenster (http://studierfenster.tugraz.at/), an online, cloud-based
medical image processing platform for medical imaging applications. Enhanced by
deep learning algorithms, the system automatically restores the missing part of
a skull (i.e., skull shape completion) and generates the desired implant by
subtracting the defective skull from the completed skull. The generated implant
can be downloaded in the STereoLithography (.stl) format directly via the
browser interface of the system. The implant model can then be sent to a 3D
printer for in loco implant manufacturing. Furthermore, thanks to the standard
format, the user can thereafter load the model into another application for
post-processing whenever necessary. Such an automatic cranial implant design
system can be integrated into the clinical practice to improve the current
routine for surgeries related to skull defect repair (e.g., cranioplasty). Our
system, although currently intended for educational and research use only, can
be seen as an application of additive manufacturing for fast, patient-specific
implant design.

precisions entails, in the photon-counting limit, a minimum photon cost that
scales as the squared ratio of the width, $w$, of the optical system's
point-spread function (PSF) and the sought localization precision, $d$, i.e.,
as $\alpha(w/d)^2$. For sources with a finite emission-frequency spectrum,
while the inverse quadratic scaling is expected to remain unchanged, the
coefficient $\alpha$ must increase due to a degrading fidelity of localization
as the imaging bandwidth increases and PSF undergoes a frequency-dependent
widening. We specifically address how rapidly $\alpha$ must increase with
increasing width of a flat-top spectral profile of emission of a point source
being localized in two dimensions by an imager with a clear circular aperture
by calculating quantum Fisher information (QFI), whose inverse yields the
lowest possible unbiased-estimation variance of source-localization error. The
novel use of prolate spheroidal wave functions as a basis for obtaining a
solution of the eigenvalue problem of the single-photon density operator needed
for the QFI calculation helps us develop the notion of an effective
dimensionality of the continuous-state problem in terms of the associated
space-bandwidth parameter. We subsequently extend our considerations of QFI to
treat the finite-bandwidth pair superresolution problem in two dimensions,
obtaining similar results. We also consider generalizations to emission power
spectra of arbitrary profiles.

gas flows through micro-channels. Both diffusely and specularly reflective
channel surfaces are considered. Gaskinetic methods are adopted to develop the
analytical solutions for surface and flowfield properties. The crucial steps
include constructing the velocity distribution functions (VDFs) for points at
the plate surfaces and inside flowfield, and then completing the integration
over the related velocity phases. For diffusely reflective surfaces, the VDFs
are related to the densities and temperatures at the two exits and the plate
temperatures. For surfaces with specular reflections, the VDFs at the plate
surface and inside the flowfield are identical, and independent of the surface
temperature ratio and the geometric aspect ratio. Based on the VDFs and
velocity phases, surface property coefficients (e.g., C_p, C_f, and C_q) and
flowfield properties (e.g., density, velocity components, and temperature) are
obtained. For the diffusely reflective surface scenario, the mass flow rate can
be approximated and the results include four non-dimensional parameters: the
aspect ratio, the density ratio, and two temperature ratios. For specularly
reflective surface scenario, the surface and flowfield properties are uniform
everywhere, the channel aspect ratio and plate temperatures do not have any
influence. Particle simulations with the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)

computational drug repositioning and prediction of drug side-effects. A drug
hierarchy is a valuable source that encodes human knowledge of drug relations
in a tree-like structure where drugs that act on the same organs, treat the
same disease, or bind to the same biological target are grouped together.
However, its utility in learning drug representations has not yet been
explored, and currently described drug representations cannot place novel
molecules in a drug hierarchy. Here, we develop a semi-supervised drug
embedding that incorporates two sources of information: (1) underlying chemical
grammar that is inferred from molecular structures of drugs and drug-like
molecules (unsupervised), and (2) hierarchical relations that are encoded in an
expert-crafted hierarchy of approved drugs (supervised). We use the Variational
Auto-Encoder (VAE) framework to encode the chemical structures of molecules and
use the knowledge-based drug-drug similarity to induce the clustering of drugs
in hyperbolic space. The hyperbolic space is amenable for encoding hierarchical
concepts. Both quantitative and qualitative results support that the learned
drug embedding can accurately reproduce the chemical structure and induce the
hierarchical relations among drugs. Furthermore, our approach can infer the
pharmacological properties of novel molecules by retrieving similar drugs from
the embedding space. We demonstrate that the learned drug embedding can be used
to find new uses for existing drugs and to discover side-effects. We show that
it significantly outperforms baselines in both tasks.

well-studied teacher-student setting where the target values are generated by
the same architecture, and when directly optimizing over the population squared
loss with respect to Gaussian inputs. We prove that while the objective is
strongly convex around the global minima when the teacher and student networks
possess the same number of neurons, it is not even \emph{locally convex} after
any amount of over-parameterization. Moreover, related desirable properties
(e.g., one-point strong convexity and the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz condition) also
do not hold even locally. On the other hand, we establish that the objective
remains one-point strongly convex in \emph{most} directions (suitably defined),
and show an optimization guarantee under this property. For the non-global
minima, we prove that adding even just a single neuron will turn a non-global
minimum into a saddle point. This holds under some technical conditions which
we validate empirically. These results provide a possible explanation for why
recovering a global minimum becomes significantly easier when we
over-parameterize, even if the amount of over-parameterization is very
moderate.

channels with the ground, UAVs could cause/suffer severe interference to/from a
large number of non-associated but co-channel base stations (BSs) in their
uplink/downlink communications. In this letter, we propose a new cooperative
interference cancellation (CIC) scheme for the UAV's uplink communication to
mitigate its strong interference to co-channel BSs, which requires only local
cooperation between each co-channel BS and its adjacent helping BSs.
Specifically, the helping BSs without serving any users in the UAV's
communication channel quantize and forward their received signals from the UAV
to their aided co-channel BS, which then processes the quantized signals
jointly with its own received signal to decode its served terrestrial user's
message via canceling the UAV's signal by linear/nonlinear interference
cancellation techniques (ICTs). We derive the achievable rates of the proposed
CIC scheme with different ICTs as a function of the UAV's transmit power and
rate, and thereby unveil the conditions under which the proposed CIC scheme
outperforms the existing CIC scheme based on the decode-and-forward (DF)
operation of the helping BSs.

the algorithms are worst-case optimal in general but fail in achieving tighter
bounds in certain simpler or more practical cases. In this paper, we develop
algorithms to advance the online learning of quantum states. First, we show
that Regularized Follow-the-Leader (RFTL) method with Tallis-2 entropy can
achieve an $O(\sqrt{MT})$ total loss with perfect hindsight on the first $T$

maximum rank $M$ of measurements rather than the number of qubits, which takes
advantage of low-rank measurements. Second, we propose a parameter-free

achieve a regret depending on the loss of best states in hindsight, which takes
advantage of low noisy outcomes. Besides these more adaptive bounds, we also

two recent approaches to predictive modeling -action-conditional CPC (Guo et

predictive objectives in a visually-rich, 3D environment with an assortment of
objects, colors, shapes, and spatial configurations, we probe their internal
state representations with synthetic (English) questions, without
backpropagating gradients from the question-answering decoder into the agent.
The performance of different agents when probed this way reveals that they
learn to encode factual, and seemingly compositional, information about
objects, properties and spatial relations from their physical environment. Our
approach is intuitive, i.e. humans can easily interpret responses of the model
as opposed to inspecting continuous vectors, and model-agnostic, i.e.
applicable to any modeling approach. By revealing the implicit knowledge of
objects, quantities, properties and relations acquired by agents as they learn,
question-conditional agent probing can stimulate the design and development of

constraints on tidal deformability and hence on the radii of the stars,
extracted from the binary GW170817. Moreover, tidal deformability for different
chirp masses and different binary mass ratios of hybrid stars have been
studied. The mass-radius relation satisfies the new constraint obtained from
the neutron star interior composition explorer (NICER). A comprehensive

measure, is shown to carry the structure of a Riemannian manifold. One
consequence of this is a compactness theorem for Riemannian manifolds with
$L^p$ curvature bounds and an a priori volume growth assumption in the pointed
Cheeger-Gromov topology. A different notion of convergence is also studied,
which replaces the exhaustion by balls in the pointed Cheeger-Gromov topology
with an exhaustion by volume non-collapsed regions. Assuming in addition a
lower bound on the Ricci curvature, the compactness theorem is extended to this
topology. Moreover, we study how a convergent sequence of manifolds disconnects
topologically in the limit. In two dimensions, building on results of Shioya,
the structure of limit spaces is described in detail: it is seen to be a union
of an incomplete Riemannian surface and 1-dimensional length spaces.

can be quite pessimistic when the input instance at hand is far from
worst-case. Often this is not an issue with machine learning approaches, which
shine in exploiting patterns in past inputs in order to predict the future.
However, such predictions, although usually accurate, can be arbitrarily poor.
Inspired by a recent line of work, we augment three well-known online settings
with machine learned predictions about the future, and develop algorithms that
take them into account. In particular, we study the following online selection
problems: (i) the classical secretary problem, (ii) online bipartite matching
and (iii) the graphic matroid secretary problem. Our algorithms still come with
a worst-case performance guarantee in the case that predictions are subpar
while obtaining an improved competitive ratio (over the best-known classical
online algorithm for each problem) when the predictions are sufficiently

disciplines such as the transmission of disease, the spread of information and
the diffusion of innovations. An appropriate virality metric should be able to
disambiguate between a shallow, broadcast-like diffusion process and a deep,
multi-generational branching process. Although several valuable works have been
dedicated to this field, most of them fail to take the position of the
diffusion source into consideration, which makes them fall into the trap of
graph isomorphism and would result in imprecise estimation of cascade virality

  In this paper, we propose a root-aware approach to quantifying the virality
of cascades with proper consideration of the root node in a diffusion tree.
With applications on synthetic and empirical cascades, we show the properties
and potential utility of the proposed virality measure. Based on preferential
attachment mechanisms, we further introduce a model to mimic the growth of
cascades. The proposed model enables the interpolation between broadcast and
viral spreading during the growth of cascades. Through numerical simulations,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in characterizing the
virality of growing cascades. Our work contributes to the understanding of
cascade virality and growth, and could offer practical implications in a range
of policy domains including viral marketing, infectious disease and information
diffusion.

Social influence can be reasoned through role theory, which indicates that the
influences among individuals depend on their roles and the behavior of
interest. To operationalize these social science theories, we empirically
identify the homophilous communities and use the community structures to
capture the ""roles"", which affect the particular decision-making processes. We
propose a generative model named Stochastic Block Influence Model and jointly
analyze both the network formation and the behavioral influence within and
between different empirically-identified communities. To evaluate the
performance and demonstrate the interpretability of our method, we study the
adoption decisions of microfinance in an Indian village. We show that although
individuals tend to form links within communities, there are strong positive

theory. Moreover, we find that communities with shared characteristics are
associated with positive influence. In contrast, the communities with a lack of
overlap are associated with negative influence. Our framework facilitates the
quantification of the influences underlying decision communities and is thus a
useful tool for driving information diffusion, viral marketing, and technology

a novel symmetric matrix representation of the 3D rotation group, SO(3), with
two important properties that make it particularly suitable for learned models:
(1) it satisfies a smoothness property that improves convergence and

our formulation by training deep neural rotation regressors on two data

representation leads to superior predictive accuracy over existing
representations for arbitrary rotation targets. Second, we use image data
collected onboard ground and aerial vehicles to demonstrate that our
representation is amenable to an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) rejection
technique that significantly improves the robustness of rotation estimates to
unseen environmental effects and corrupted input images, without requiring the
use of an explicit likelihood loss, stochastic sampling, or an auxiliary

where the similarity of a bag with a shapelet is the maximum similarity of
instances in the bag. In previous work, some of the training instances are
chosen as shapelets with no theoretical justification. In our formulation, we
use all possible, and thus infinitely many shapelets, resulting in a richer
class of classifiers. We show that the formulation is tractable, that is, it
can be reduced through Linear Programming Boosting (LPBoost) to Difference of
Convex (DC) programs of finite (actually polynomial) size. Our theoretical
result also gives justification to the heuristics of some of the previous work.
The time complexity of the proposed algorithm highly depends on the size of the
set of all instances in the training sample. To apply to the data containing a
large number of instances, we also propose a heuristic option of the algorithm
without the loss of the theoretical guarantee. Our empirical study demonstrates
that our algorithm uniformly works for Shapelet Learning tasks on time-series
classification and various MIL tasks with comparable accuracy to the existing
methods. Moreover, we show that the proposed heuristics allow us to achieve the
result with reasonable computational time.

solving a multidimensional inverse problem given a finite number of
projections. Backprojection is a popular class of algorithm for tomographic
reconstruction, however it typically results in poor image reconstructions when
the projection angles are sparse and/or if the sensors characteristics are not
uniform. Several deep learning based algorithms have been developed to solve
this inverse problem and reconstruct the image using a limited number of
projections. However these algorithms typically require examples of the
ground-truth (i.e. examples of reconstructed images) to yield good performance.
In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised sparse-view backprojection
algorithm, which does not require ground-truth. The algorithm consists of two
modules in a generator-projector framework; a convolutional neural network and
a spatial transformer network. We evaluated our algorithm using computed
tomography (CT) images of the human chest. We show that our algorithm
significantly out-performs filtered backprojection when the projection angles
are very sparse, as well as when the sensor characteristics vary for different
angles. Our approach has practical applications for medical imaging and other

response to external influences such as substrate orientation or strain,
resulting in essentially new materials in terms of the electronic structure. A
striking example is the creation of flat-bands in bilayer-graphene for certain
'magic' twist-angles between the orientations of the two layers. The quenched
kinetic-energy in these flat-bands promotes electron-electron interactions and
facilitates the emergence of strongly-correlated phases such as
superconductivity and correlated-insulators. However, the exquisite fine-tuning
required for finding the magic-angle where flat-bands appear in twisted-bilayer
graphene, poses challenges to fabrication and scalability. Here we present an
alternative route to creating flat-bands that does not involve fine tuning.
Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, together with numerical
simulations, we demonstrate that graphene monolayers placed on an
atomically-flat substrate can be forced to undergo a buckling-transition,
resulting in a periodically modulated pseudo-magnetic field, which in turn

strategy for creating other superlattice systems and, in particular, for
exploring interaction phenomena characteristic of flat-bands.

$\frac{s^*}{n} \log (1+\frac{p}{s^*})$ up to a multiplicative constant that is

cross-modal effects, we review a cortical multisensory syndrome (called central
syndrome) associated with a unilateral parieto-occipital lesion in a rather
unspecific (or multisensory) zone of the cortex.
  The patients with this syndrome suffered from bilateral and symmetric
multisensory disorders dependent on the extent of nervous mass lost and the
intensity of the stimulus. They also presented cross-modal effects. A key point
is the similitude of this syndrome with a normal state, since this syndrome
would be the result of a scale reduction in brain excitability. The first
qualities lost when the nervous excitation diminishes are the most complex
ones, following allometric laws proper of a dynamic system.
  The inverted perception (visual, tactile, auditive) in this syndrome is
compared to other cases of visual inversion reported in the literature. We
focus on the capability of improving perception by intensifying the stimulus or
by means of another type of stimulus (cross-modal), muscular effort being one
of the most efficient and least known means. This capability is greater when
nervous excitability deficit (lesion) is greater and when the primary stimulus
is weaker. Thus, in a normal subject, this capability is much weaker although
perceptible for functions with high excitability demand. We also review the
proposed scheme of functional cortical gradients whereby the specificity of the
cortex is distributed with a continuous variation leading to a brain dynamics
model accounting for multisensory or cross-modal interactions. Perception data
(including cross-modal effects) in this syndrome are fitted using Stevens'
power law which we relate to the allometric scaling power laws dependent on the
active neural mass, which seem to be the laws governing many biological neural
networks.

8542 A line obtained with the SST to study the magnetic field in solar
spicules. Methods. The equations that result from the application of the Weak
Field Approximation (WFA) to the radiative transfer equations are used to infer
the LOS component of the magnetic field (BLOS). Two restrictive conditions are
imposed on the Stokes I and V profiles at each pixel before they can be used in
a Bayesian inversion to compute its BLOS. Results. The LOS magnetic field
component has been inferred in six data sets totalling 448 spectral scans in
the Ca ii 8542 A line and containing both active region and quiet Sun areas,
with values of hundreds of G being abundantly inferred. There seems to be no
difference, from the statistical point of view, between the magnetic field
strength of spicules in the quiet Sun or near an active region. On the other
hand, the BLOS distributions present smaller values on the disk than off-limb,
a fact that can be explained by the effect of superposition on the chromosphere
of on-disk structures. We find that spicules in the vicinity of a sunspot have
a magnetic field polarity (i.e. north or south) equal to that of the sunspot.
This paper also contains an analysis of the effect of off-limb overlapping
structures on the observed Stokes I and V parameters and the BLOS obtained from
the WFA. It is found that this value is equal to or smaller than the largest
LOS magnetic field components of the two structures. In addition, using random
BLOS, Doppler velocities and line intensities of these two structures leads in
~ 50% of the cases to Stokes I and V parameters unsuitable to be used with the
WFA. Conclusions. Our results present a scarcity of LOS magnetic field
components smaller than some 50 G, which must not be taken as evidence against
the existence of these magnetic field strengths in spicules.

method to combat costly physical simulations and immense, often intractable,

the dependence on data induces a unique challenge: An imbalanced dataset

the efficacy of data-driven approaches. In answer, we posit that a smaller yet
diverse set of unit cells leads to scalable search and unbiased learning. To
select such subsets, we propose METASET, a methodology that 1) uses similarity
metrics and positive semi-definite kernels to jointly measure the closeness of
unit cells in both shape and property spaces, and 2) incorporates Determinantal
Point Processes for efficient subset selection. Moreover, METASET allows the
trade-off between shape and property diversity so that subsets can be tuned for
various applications. Through the design of 2D metamaterials with target
displacement profiles, we demonstrate that smaller, diverse subsets can indeed
improve the search process as well as structural performance. By eliminating
inherent overlaps in a dataset of 3D unit cells created with symmetry rules, we
also illustrate that our flexible method can distill unique subsets regardless
of the metric employed. Our diverse subsets are provided publicly for use by

an intuitive idea would be to reduce human intervention as much as possible and
let the algorithm automatically design the neural architecture. Neural
Architecture Search (NAS) is just such a revolutionary algorithm, and the
related research work is complicated and rich. Therefore, a comprehensive and
systematic survey on the NAS is essential. Previously related surveys have

  Most Prominent and Separable Features","Pages 1-14",,,,"cs.IR cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In sentiment classification, the enormous amount of textual data, its immense
dimensionality, and inherent noise make it extremely difficult for machine
learning classifiers to extract high-level and complex abstractions. In order
to make the data less sparse and more statistically significant, the
dimensionality reduction techniques are needed. But in the existing
dimensionality reduction techniques, the number of components needs to be set
manually which results in loss of the most prominent features, thus reducing
the performance of the classifiers. Our prior work, i.e., Term Presence Count
(TPC) and Term Presence Ratio (TPR) have proven to be effective techniques as
they reject the less separable features. However, the most prominent and
separable features might still get removed from the initial feature set despite
having higher distributions among positive and negative tagged documents. To
overcome this problem, we have proposed a new framework that consists of
two-dimensionality reduction techniques i.e., Sentiment Term Presence Count
(SentiTPC) and Sentiment Term Presence Ratio (SentiTPR). These techniques
reject the features by considering term presence difference for SentiTPC and
ratio of the distribution distinction for SentiTPR. Additionally, these methods
also analyze the total distribution information. Extensive experimental results
exhibit that the proposed framework reduces the feature dimension by a large
scale, and thus significantly improve the classification performance.

preventing new transmissions of the virus and allowing PLWH to live normal and
healthy lifespans. Maintaining regular appointments with an HIV provider and
taking medication daily for a lifetime is exceedingly difficult. 51% of PLWH
are non-adherent with their medications and eventually drop out of medical
care. Current methods of re-linking individuals to care are reactive (after a
patient has dropped-out) and hence not very effective. We describe our system
to predict who is most at risk to drop-out-of-care for use by the University of
Chicago HIV clinic and the Chicago Department of Public Health. Models were
selected based on their predictive performance under resource constraints,
stability over time, as well as fairness. Our system is applicable as a
point-of-care system in a clinical setting as well as a batch prediction system
to support regular interventions at the city level. Our model performs 3x
better than the baseline for the clinical model and 2.3x better than baseline
for the city-wide model. The code has been released on github and we hope this
methodology, particularly our focus on fairness, will be adopted by other
clinics and public health agencies in order to curb the HIV epidemic.

  Prediction of Brain Tumor Patients","Accepted by MICCAI'20",,,,"eess.IV cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Early and accurate prediction of overall survival (OS) time can help to
obtain better treatment planning for brain tumor patients. Although many OS
time prediction methods have been developed and obtain promising results, there
are still several issues. First, conventional prediction methods rely on
radiomic features at the local lesion area of a magnetic resonance (MR) volume,
which may not represent the full image or model complex tumor patterns. Second,
different types of scanners (i.e., multi-modal data) are sensitive to different
brain regions, which makes it challenging to effectively exploit the
complementary information across multiple modalities and also preserve the
modality-specific properties. Third, existing methods focus on prediction
models, ignoring complex data-to-label relationships. To address the above
issues, we propose an end-to-end OS time prediction model; namely, Multi-modal
Multi-channel Network (M2Net). Specifically, we first project the 3D MR volume
onto 2D images in different directions, which reduces computational costs,
while preserving important information and enabling pre-trained models to be
transferred from other tasks. Then, we use a modality-specific network to
extract implicit and high-level features from different MR scans. A multi-modal
shared network is built to fuse these features using a bilinear pooling model,
exploiting their correlations to provide complementary information. Finally, we
integrate the outputs from each modality-specific network and the multi-modal
shared network to generate the final prediction result. Experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our M2Net model over other methods.

verifying their human customers. We mainly focused on the preprocessing step
for every CAPTCHA which converts them in binary intensity and removes the
confusion as much as possible and developed various models to correctly label

process of verifying the humans which makes it easy for humans to solve the

Social distancing measures made fewer people available to work. In such
situations, robots were pointed at to support humans to address a shortage in
supply. An important activity where humans are needed in a manufacturing value
chain is assembly. HRC assembly systems are supposed to safeguard coexisting
humans, perform a range of actions, and often need to be reconfigured to handle
product variety. This requires them to be resilient and adaptable to various
configurations during their operational life. Besides the potential advantages
of using robots the challenges of using them in an industrial assembly are
enormous. Methods: This mini-review summarizes the challenges of industrial
deployment of collaborative robots for assembly applications. Applications: The

display advertising inventory in auctions that occur within milliseconds. The
performance of RTB campaigns is generally measured with a series of Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) - measurements used to ensure that the campaign
is cost-effective and that it is purchasing valuable inventory. While an RTB
campaign should ideally meet all KPIs, simultaneous improvement tends to be
very challenging, as an improvement to any one KPI risks a detrimental effect
toward the others. Here we present an approach to simultaneously controlling
multiple KPIs with a PID-based feedback-control system. This method generates a
control score for each KPI, based on both the output of a PID controller module
and a metric that quantifies the importance of each KPI for internal business
needs. On regular intervals, this algorithm - Sequential Control - will choose
the KPI with the greatest overall need for improvement. In this way, our
algorithm is able to continually seek the greatest marginal improvements to its
current state. Multiple methods of control can be associated with each KPI, and
can be triggered either simultaneously or chosen stochastically, in order to
avoid local optima. In both offline ad bidding simulations and testing on live
traffic, our methods proved to be effective in simultaneously controlling
multiple KPIs, and bringing them toward their respective goals.
