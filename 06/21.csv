considerable consequences on its spacetime geometry. Hence, in this article, we
explore its effect on horizons and the silhouette generated by a Kerr-Newman
black hole in quintessential dark energy. Moreover, to analyze the deflection
angle of light, we utilize the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. The obtained result
demonstrates that, due to the dragging effect, the black hole spin elongates
its shadow in the direction of the rotational axis, while increases the
deflection angle. On the other hand, the black hole charge diminishing its
shadow, as well as the angle of lights deflection. Besides, both spin and
charge significantly increase the distortion effect in the black hole's shadow.
The quintessence parameter \gamma, increases the shadow radius, while decreases
the distortion effect at higher values of charge and spin parameters.

allowing to retrieve natural images relevant to hand-drawn sketch queries that
are rarely seen during the training phase. Related prior works either require
aligned sketch-image pairs that are costly to obtain or inefficient memory
fusion layer for mapping the visual information to a semantic space. In this
paper, we address any-shot, i.e. zero-shot and few-shot, sketch-based image
retrieval (SBIR) tasks, where we introduce the few-shot setting for SBIR. For
solving these tasks, we propose a semantically aligned paired cycle-consistent
generative adversarial network (SEM-PCYC) for any-shot SBIR, where each branch
of the generative adversarial network maps the visual information from sketch
and image to a common semantic space via adversarial training. Each of these
branches maintains cycle consistency that only requires supervision at the
category level, and avoids the need of aligned sketch-image pairs. A
classification criteria on the generators' outputs ensures the visual to
semantic space mapping to be class-specific. Furthermore, we propose to combine
textual and hierarchical side information via an auto-encoder that selects
discriminating side information within a same end-to-end model. Our results
demonstrate a significant boost in any-shot SBIR performance over the
state-of-the-art on the extended version of the challenging Sketchy, TU-Berlin

also show that both adversarial training and small-batch training leads to a
drop in the dominant eigenvalues of the Hessian or lowering its spectrum. They
combine adversarial training and second order information to come up with a new
large-batch training algorithm and obtain robust models with good

of cellular users by means of instantly decodable network coding (IDNC) with
the help of intermittently connected D2D links. Of particular interest are
broadcasting real-time applications such as video-on-demand, where common
contents may be partially received by cellular users due to packet erasures
over cellular links. Specifically, we investigate the problem of packet
completion time, defined as the number of transmission slots necessary to
deliver a common content to all users. Drawing on graph theory, we develop an
optimal packet completion time strategy by constructing a two-layer IDNC
conflict graph. The higher-layer graph permits us to determine all feasible
packet combinations that can be transmitted over the cellular link, while the
lower-layer graph enables us to find all feasible network coded packets and
identify the set of users that can generate and transmit these packets via
intermittently connected D2D links. By combining the higher-layer and the
lower-layer IDNC conflict graphs, we demonstrate that finding the optimal IDNC
packets to minimize the packet completion time problem is equivalent to finding
the maximum independent set of the two-layer IDNC conflict graph, which is
known to be an NP-hard problem. We design a scheme that invokes the
Bron-Kerbosch algorithm to find the optimal policy. To circumvent the high
computational complexity required to reach the global optimum, we establish a
polynomial-time solvable low-complexity heuristic to find an efficient
sub-optimal solution. The effectiveness of our proposed scheme is verified
through extensive numerical results which indicate substantial performance
improvement in comparison with existing methods.

case model for online algorithms. While it avoids the pessimism of the
traditional adversarial model, in practice we cannot expect the input to be
presented in perfectly random order. This has motivated research on ``best of
both worlds'' (algorithms with good performance on both purely stochastic and
purely adversarial inputs), or even better, on inputs that are a mix of both
stochastic and adversarial parts. Unfortunately the latter seems much harder to
achieve and very few results of this type are known.
  Towards advancing our understanding of designing such robust algorithms, we
propose a random-order model with bursts of adversarial time steps. The
assumption of burstiness of unexpected patterns is reasonable in many contexts,
since changes (e.g. spike in a demand for a good) are often triggered by a
common external event. We then consider the Knapsack Secretary problem in this
model: there is a knapsack of size $k$ (e.g., available quantity of a good),
and in each of the $n$ time steps an item comes with its value and size in
$[0,1]$ and the algorithm needs to make an irrevocable decision whether to
accept or reject the item.
  We design an algorithm that gives an approximation of $1 -
\tilde{O}(\Gamma/k)$ when the adversarial time steps can be covered by $\Gamma
\ge \sqrt{k}$ intervals of size $\tilde{O}(\frac{n}{k})$. In particular,
setting $\Gamma = \sqrt{k}$ gives a $(1 - O(\frac{\ln^2
k}{\sqrt{k}}))$-approximation that is resistant to up to a $\frac{\ln^2
k}{\sqrt{k}}$-fraction of the items being adversarial, which is almost optimal
even in the absence of adversarial items. Also, setting $\Gamma =
\tilde{\Omega}(k)$ gives a constant approximation that is resistant to up to a
constant fraction of items being adversarial.

this coronavirus is currently evolving into an array of strains with increasing
genetic diversity. Most variants apparently have neutral effects for disease
spread and symptoms severity. However, in the viral Spike protein, which is
responsible for host cell attachment and invasion, an emergent variant,
containing the amino acid substitution D to G in position 614 (D614G), was
suggested to increase viral infection capability. To test whether this variant
has epidemiological impact, the temporal distributions of the SARS-CoV-2
samples bearing D or G at position 614 were compared in the USA, Asia and
Europe. The epidemiological curves were compared at early and late epidemic
stages. At early stages, where containment measures were still not fully
implemented, the viral variants are supposed to be unconstrained and its growth
curves might approximate the free viral dynamics. Our analysis shows that the
D614G prevalence and the growth rates of COVID-19 epidemic curves are
correlated in the USA, Asia and Europe. Our results suggest a selective sweep
that can be explained, at least in part, by a propagation advantage of this
variant, in other words, that the molecular level effects of D614G have
sufficient impact on population transmission dynamics as to be detected by
differences in rate coefficients of epidemic growth curves.

shear flows manipulated using actuators common in experimental flow control
studies. In particular, we adapt this powerful analytical framework to
investigate the flow response to specified geometric actuation patterns (e.g.,
different plasma actuators) that can be applied over a range of different
temporal input signals. For example, the commonly studied steady-state
(time-averaged) flow response corresponds to a superposition of step responses
in our modeling framework. The approach takes advantage of the linearity of the
transfer function representation to construct the actuated flow field as a
weighted superposition of the flow responses to point sources of varying
intensity comprising the actuation model. We first validate the proposed method
through comparisons with numerical and experimental studies of the
time-averaged behavior of a transitional boundary layer actuated using a
dielectric-barrier discharge plasma actuator operating in constricted discharge
mode. The method is shown to reproduce the streamwise velocity field and the
vortical structures observed downstream from the tested plasma actuator
configurations. We then demonstrate that the method provides even better
agreement with the steady-state response of the boundary layer subject to
actuation from arrays of symmetric plasma actuators arranged in both spanwise
and serpentine geometries. These results indicate the utility of this extension
to the widely used input-output framework in analyzing the effects of certain
actuation modalities that have shown promise in flow manipulation strategies
for drag reduction. An important benefit of this analytical method is the low
computational cost associated with its use in extensive parametric studies that
would be cost-prohibitive using experiments or high-fidelity simulations.

a stationary HTS coated-conductor wire in the open-circuit configuration,
assuming for simplicity the 2D (infinitely long) case. Despite this geometric
simplicity the solution is complex, comprising time-varying
spatially-inhomogeneous currents and fields throughout the superconducting

different methods, including H-formulation-based methods, coupled H-A and T-A
formulations, the Minimum Electromagnetic Entropy Production method, and
integral equation and volume integral equation-based equivalent circuit
methods. Each of these approaches show excellent qualitative and quantitative
agreement for the open-circuit equivalent instantaneous voltage and the

condensations form but we artificially initiate the draining of the prominence.
We find that the prominence weight has a significant effect on the stability of
the flux rope, and can significantly increase the loss-of-equilibrium height.
The flux rope can be made to erupt earlier by initiating draining of the
prominence mass. We have also performed a simulation where large amplitude
longitudinal oscillations of the prominence are excited during the quasi-static
phase. We find that the gravity force along the magnetic field lines is the
major restoring force for the oscillations, in accordance with the ``pendulum
model'', although the oscillation periods are higher (by about 10% to 40%) than
estimated from the model because of the dynamic deformation of the field line
dips during the oscillations. The oscillation period is also found to be
slightly smaller for the lower part of the prominence in the deeper dips
compared to the upper part in the shallower dips. The oscillations are quickly
damped out after about 2-3 periods and are followed by prominence draining and
the eventual eruption of the prominence. However we do not find a significant
enhancement of the prominence draining and earlier onset of eruption with the
excitation of the prominence oscillations compared to the case without.

algorithms pose serious threats with severe outcomes. Recent work demonstrated
that Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), typically used in facial recognition systems,
are susceptible to backdoor attacks; in other words,the DNNs turn malicious in
the presence of a unique trigger. Adhering to common characteristics for being
unnoticeable, an ideal trigger is small, localized, and typically not a part of
the main im-age. Therefore, detection mechanisms have focused on detecting
these distinct trigger-based outliers statistically or through their
reconstruction. In this work, we demonstrate that specific changes to facial

The changes in the facial attributes maybe embedded artificially using
social-media filters or introduced naturally using movements in facial muscles.

does not interfere with the performance criteria of the model. We also
substantiate the undetectability of our triggers by exhaustively testing them

researches solve this problem as a One-Class Classification (OCC) task where
they train a reference model on all of the available samples. Then, they
consider a test sample as an anomaly if it has a diversion from the reference
model. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved the most promising
results for OCC while implementing and training such networks, especially for
the OCC task, is a cumbersome and computationally expensive procedure. To cope
with the mentioned challenges, we present a simple but effective method to
solve the irregularity detection as a binary classification task in order to
make the implementation easier along with improving the detection performance.
We learn two deep neural networks (generator and discriminator) in a GAN-style
setting on merely the normal samples. During training, the generator gradually
becomes an expert to generate samples which are similar to the normal ones. In
the training phase, when the generator fails to produce normal data (in the
early stages of learning and also prior to the complete convergence), it can be
considered as an irregularity generator. In this way, we simultaneously
generate the irregular samples. Afterward, we train a binary classifier on the
generated anomalous samples along with the normal instances in order to be
capable of detecting irregularities. The proposed framework applies to
different related applications of outlier and anomaly detection in images and
videos, respectively. The results confirm that our proposed method is superior
to the baseline and state-of-the-art solutions.

conventional processing pipeline first performs demosaicking on each fisheye
camera's Bayer-patterned grid, then translates demosaicked pixels from the
camera grid to a rectified image grid---thus performing two image interpolation
steps in sequence. Hence interpolation errors can accumulate, and acquisition
noise in the captured pixels can pollute neighbors in two consecutive
processing stages. In this paper, we propose a joint processing framework that
performs demosaicking and grid-to-grid mapping simultaneously---thus limiting
noise pollution to one interpolation. Specifically, we first obtain a reverse
mapping function from a regular on-grid location in the rectified image to an
irregular off-grid location in the camera's Bayer-patterned image. For each
pair of adjacent pixels in the rectified grid, we estimate its gradient using
the pair's neighboring pixel gradients in three colors in the Bayer-patterned

interpolate pixels in the rectified grid directly via graph Laplacian

increases. A promising way out is to test programs modularly, e.g., on a per
function or class basis. Alas, this idea hits a roadblock in modern programming
languages In modern languages, components expect functions, objects, and even
classes as inputs. The crux of the problem is that existing concolic testing
techniques cannot faithfully capture the complex interactions between a
higher-order program and its inputs in order to distill it in a first-order
formula that an SMT solver can work with. In this paper, we take the first step
towards solving the problem; we offer a design, semantics, and prototype for
concolic testing of higher-order functions. Inspired by work on higher-order
symbolic execution, our model constructs inputs for higher-order functions with
a canonical shape. This enables the concolic tester to keep track of which
pieces of the control-flow path of the higher-order function depend on the
shape of its input and which do not. The concolic tester encodes the pieces
that do not depend on the shape of the input as a first-order formula.
Subsequently, similar to a first-order concolic tester, it leverages an SMT
solver to produce another input with the same shape but that explores a
different control-flow path of the higher-order function. As a separate
dimension, the concolic tester iteratively explores the canonical shapes for

idea of auto-encoding the wanted landmarks in the latent space while discarding
the non-essential information (and effectively preserving the

bottleneck containing nothing but the wanted key-points) is achieved by a new
two-step regularization approach. The first regularization step evaluates
transport distance from a given set of landmarks to some average value (the
barycenter by Wasserstein distance). The second regularization step controls
deviations from the barycenter by applying random geometric deformations
synchronously to the initial image and to the encoded landmarks. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the approach both in unsupervised and semi-supervised

sustain flow-induced, transverse vibrations of cylinders. The influence of
different mechanisms is quantified by using a method to partition the fluid
dynamic force on the cylinder into distinct, physically relevant components. In
conjunction with this force partitioning, calculations of the energy extracted
by the oscillating body from the flow are used to make a direct connection
between the phenomena responsible for force generation and their effect on
driving flow-induced oscillations. These tools are demonstrated in a study of
the effect of cylinder shape on flow-induced vibrations. Relatively small
increases in cylinder aspect-ratio are found to have a significant influence on
the amplitude of oscillation, resulting in a large drop in oscillation
amplitude at reduced velocities that correspond to the upper range of the
synchronization regime. By mapping out the energy transfer between the fluid
and structure as a function of aspect-ratio, we identify the existence of a
low-amplitude stationary state as the cause of the drop in amplitude.
Partitioning the fluid dynamic forces on cylinders of varying aspect-ratio then
allows us to uncover the physical mechanisms behind the appearance of the
underlying bifurcation. The analysis also suggests that while vortex shedding
in the wake is necessary to initiate oscillations, it is the vorticity
associated with the boundary layer over the cylinder that is responsible for
the sustenance of flow-induced vibrations.

distancing and stay-at-home measures, with increased attention to room
ventilation emerging only more recently. Effective distancing practices for
open spaces can be ineffective for poorly ventilated spaces, both of which are
commonly filled with turbulent air. This is typical for indoor spaces that use
mixing ventilation. While turbulence initially reduces the risk of infection
near a virion-source, it eventually increases the exposure risk for all
occupants in a space without ventilation. To complement detailed models aimed
at precision, minimalist frameworks are useful to facilitate order of magnitude
estimates for how much ventilation provides safety, particularly when
circumstances require practical decisions with limited options. Applying basic
principles of transport and diffusion, we estimate the time-scale for virions
injected into a room of turbulent air to infect an occupant, distinguishing
cases of low vs. high initial virion mass loads and virion-destroying vs.
virion-reflecting walls. We consider the effect of an open window as a proxy
for ventilation. When the airflow is dominated by isotropic turbulence, the
minimum area needed to ensure safety depends only on the ratio of total viral
load to threshold load for infection. The minimalist estimates here convey
simply that the equivalent of ventilation by modest sized open window in

While reparametrization-invariant Sobolev metrics provide meaningful elastic
distances and point correspondences via the geodesic boundary value problem,
solving this problem numerically tends to be difficult. Square root normal
fields (SRNF) considerably simplify the computation of certain elastic
distances between parametrized surfaces. Yet they leave open the issue of
finding optimal reparametrizations, which induce elastic distances between
unparametrized surfaces. This issue has concentrated much effort in recent
years and led to the development of several numerical frameworks. In this
paper, we take an alternative approach which bypasses the direct estimation of
reparametrizations: we relax the geodesic boundary constraint using an
auxiliary parametrization-blind varifold fidelity metric. This reformulation
has several notable benefits. By avoiding altogether the need for
reparametrizations, it provides the flexibility to deal with simplicial meshes
of arbitrary topologies and sampling patterns. Moreover, the problem lends
itself to a coarse-to-fine multi-resolution implementation, which makes the
algorithm scalable to large meshes. Furthermore, this approach extends readily
to higher-order feature maps such as square root curvature fields and is also
able to include surface textures in the matching problem. We demonstrate these
advantages on several examples, synthetic and real.

domain adaptation techniques for classification and extend them to camera pose
estimation, which is a multi-regression task. We develop a deep adaptation
network for learning scene-invariant image representations and use adversarial
learning to generate such representations for model transfer. We enrich the

validate the existence of scene-invariant representation of images in two given

is destructive and irradiation leads to the formation of 200~nm thin flakes of

achieved a control of the spallation process that enabled the fabrication of

design decentralized algorithms when the LLC, or even the GLC, is not

  To address the above question, we design a first-order algorithm called
Multi-stage gradient tracking algorithm (MAGENTA), which is capable of
computing stationary solutions with neither the LLC nor the GLC. In particular,
we show that the proposed algorithm converges sublinearly to certain
$\epsilon$-stationary solution, where the precise rate depends on various

$\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{Q-1})$. Such a rate is tight for the special case of

show that ensembles of interacting networks outperform independent ones, and
that optimal ensemble performance is reached when the coupling between networks
increases diversity and degrades the performance of individual networks. Thus,
even without a global goal for the ensemble, optimal collective behavior
emerges from local interactions between networks. We show the scaling of
optimal coupling strength with ensemble size, and that networks in these

coupling regimes. For a single two-level system in the intermediate coupling
case, as time flows, the spectrum develops distinct features, that are not
captured by a semi-classical treatment of the incident field. Specifically, for
a field on resonance with the atomic transition energy, the usual Mollow
spectrum is replaced by a four peak structure, and for a frequency that is half
of the atomic transition energy, the time-dependent spectrum develops a second
harmonic peak with a superimposed Mollow triplet. In the long-time limit, our
description recovers results previously found in the literature. After
analyzing why a different behavior is observed in the quantum and classical
dynamics, the reason for the occurrence of a second harmonic signal in a
two-level system is explained via a symmetry analysis of the total (electron

regimes. We find an increased second harmonic signal in an array of two-level

equations are employed to describe the transport processes in an aqueous
electrolyte in a parallel-plate nanochannel, where surface-acoustic waves
(SAWs) are standing or traveling along (piezo-active) channel walls. It is
found that -- in addition to the conventional acoustic streaming flow -- a
time-averaged electroosmotic flow is induced. Employing the stream
function-vorticity formulation, it is shown that the Maxwell stress term causes
an electroosmotic propulsion that is qualitatively identical to the one
discussed in the context of alternating current (AC) electroosmosis (EOF).
Differences arise mainly due to the high actuation frequencies of SAWs, which
are in the MHz range rather than in the kHz regime typical for ACEOF. Moreover,
the instantaneous spatial periodicity of the EOF in the travel direction of the
SAW is intrinsically linked to the dispersion relation of the latter rather
than a free geometric parameter. This leads to a specific frequency band where
an EOF of sizable magnitude can be found. On the low frequency end, the ratio
between the electric double layer (EDL) thickness and the SAW wavelength
becomes extremely small so that the net force leading to a non-vanishing
time-averaged flow becomes equally small. On the high frequency end, the RC
time of the EDL is much larger than the inverse of the SAW frequency leading to
a vanishing effective charge density of the EDL. For a parallel-plate channel,
the EOF can be maximized by using two SAWs on both channel walls that have the
same frequency but are phase-shifted by $180^\circ$. It appears that the
SAW-EOF is the dominant pumping mechanism for such a scenario. The proposed
actuation might be a viable alternative for driving liquid electrolytes through
narrow ducts and channels, without the need for electric interconnects and

subsamples to enable scaling. We observe that most existing minibatch MH

that this inexactness can cause arbitrarily large errors in inference. We
propose a new exact minibatch MH method, TunaMH, which exposes a tunable
trade-off between its batch size and its theoretically guaranteed convergence
rate. We prove a lower bound on the batch size that any minibatch MH method
must use to retain exactness while guaranteeing fast convergence-the first such
bound for minibatch MH-and show TunaMH is asymptotically optimal in terms of
the batch size. Empirically, we show TunaMH outperforms other exact minibatch
MH methods on robust linear regression, truncated Gaussian mixtures, and
logistic regression.

been shown to exhibit large degree of spin-momentum locking, and spin polarized
current through an external ferromagnetic contact induces the spin dependent
charge accumulation on the surface of SmB6. The dependences of the IEE signal
on the bias current, an external magnetic field direction and temperature are
consistent with the anticlockwise spin texture for the surface band in SmB6 in

found in other typical Rashba interfaces, implying that the Rashba contribution

this lower bound, and in addition is computationally efficient for

After screening, this systematic review focused on a dozen articles related to
PHL. These encompassed health topics such as infectious diseases, congestive

Evaluation measures were heterogeneous regarding PHL functions and settings. At
the time of writing, only one of the PHLs described in these articles is

with multiple mediators either involve assumptions not verifiable by
experiments, or estimate the effect when mediators are manipulated jointly
which precludes the practical design of experiments due to curse of
dimensionality, or are difficult to interpret when arbitrary causal

multiple manipulable mediators with arbitrary causal dependencies. The proposed
method is clinically relevant because the decomposition of the total effect
does not involve effects under cross-world assumptions and focuses on the
effects after manipulating (i.e. treating) one single mediator, which is more
relevant in a clinical scenario. We illustrate the approach using simulated

gas-grain interactions in star-forming cores: radical-radical recombination
reactions to form complex organic molecules (COMs) in the ice mantle,
sublimation of CH$_4$ and COMs, and their subsequent gas-phase reactions. These
chemical features are expected to depend on the composition of ice mantle which
is set in the prestellar phase. We calculated the gas-grain chemical reaction
network considering a layered ice-mantle structure in star-forming cores, to
investigate how the hot corino chemistry and WCCC depend on the physical
condition of the static phase before the onset of gravitational collapse. We
found that WCCC becomes more active, if the temperature is lower, or the visual
extinction is lower in the static phase, or the static phase is longer.
Dependence of hot corino chemistry on the static-phase condition is more
complex. While CH$_3$OH is less abundant in the models with warmer static
phase, some COMs are formed efficiently in those warm models, since there are
various formation paths of COMs. If the visual extinction is lower, photolysis
makes COMs less abundant in the static phase. Once the collapse starts and
visual extinction increases, however, COMs can be formed efficiently. Duration
of the static phase does not largely affect COM abundances. Chemical diversity
between prototypical hot corinos and hybrid sources, in which both COMs and
carbon chains are reasonably abundant, can be explained by the variation of

for face alignment. Unlike most existing facial landmark regression methods
which usually employ fully connected layers to convert feature maps into
landmark coordinate, we present a structure coherence component to explicitly
take the relation among facial landmarks into account. Due to the geometric
structure of human face, structure coherence between different facial parts
provides important cues for effectively localizing facial landmarks. However,
the dense connection in the fully connected layers overuses such coherence,
making the important cues unable to be distinguished from all connections.
Instead, our structure coherence component leverages a dynamic sparse graph
structure to passing features among the most related landmarks. Furthermore, we
propose a novel objective function, named Soft Wing loss, to improve the
accuracy. Extensive experiments on three popular benchmarks, including WFLW,
COFW and 300W, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving
state-of-the-art performance with fast speed. Our approach is especially robust
to challenging cases resulting in impressively low failure rate (0% and 2.88%)

density estimates obtained by localizing the dataset to individual points. Our
contribution is twofold: (1) theoretically, we establish firstly that GT is
stable under perturbations and secondly that in the continuous case, each point

for reducing the number of matrix square root computations inherent to the

redundant computations of GT distances between points via enhanced neighborhood

the interferometer path delay and relative phase. A common approach to enhance
the signal-to-noise ratio in these experiments is to apply a continuous phase
sweep to the relative optical path, and to detect the resulting modulated
fluorescence using a phase-sensitive lock-in amplifier. In many important
situations, the fluorescence signal is too weak to be measured using a lock-in

an approach to low-signal fluorescence-detected FT spectroscopy, in which
individual photon counts are assigned to a modulated interferometer phase
('phase-tagged photon counting,' or PTPC), and the resulting data are processed
to construct optical spectra. We studied the fluorescence signals of a
molecular sample excited resonantly by a pulsed coherent laser over a range of
photon flux and visibility levels. We compare the performance of PTPC to
standard lock-in detection methods and establish the range of signal parameters
over which meaningful measurements can be carried out. We find that PTPC

measurement uncertainty being associated with the statistics of the finite

investigated. ITR predicted by DMM is on the order of 10-9 m2K/W. Using this
ITR, UO2-BeO thermal conductivities are calculated by theoretical models and
compared with experimental data. The results indicate that DMM prediction is
applicable to the interface between UO2 and dispersed BeO, while not applicable
to the interface between UO2 and continuous BeO. If the thermal conductivity of
UO2 containing continuous BeO was to be in agreement with experimental data,
its ITR should be on the order of 10-6 - 10-5 m2K/W. Therefore, the vibrational
mismatch between UO2 and BeO considered by DMM is the major mechanism for
attenuating the heat flux through UO2/dispersed-BeO interface, but not for
UO2/continuous-BeO interface. Furthermore, it is found that the presence of ITR
leads to the dependence of the thermal conductivity of UO2 containing dispersed
BeO on BeO size. With the decrease in BeO size, UO2-BeO thermal conductivity
decreases. When BeO size is smaller than a critical value, UO2-BeO thermal
conductivity becomes even smaller than UO2 thermal conductivity. For UO2
containing continuous BeO, the thermal conductivity decreases with the decrease
in the size of UO2 granule surrounded by BeO, but not necessarily smaller than
UO2 thermal conductivity. Under a critical temperature, UO2-BeO thermal
conductivity is always larger than UO2 thermal conductivity. Above the critical
temperature, UO2-BeO thermal conductivity is larger than UO2 thermal
conductivity only when UO2 granule size is large enough. The conditions for
achieving the targeted enhancement of UO2 thermal conductivity by doping with

acceleration, an impulsive one with a peak value of ~5 km s$^{-2}$ followed by
an extended phase with accelerations up to 0.7 km s$^{-2}$. The two-phase CME
dynamics is associated with a two-episode flare energy release. While the first
episode is consistent with the ""standard"" eruption of a magnetic flux rope, the
second episode of flare energy release is initiated by the reconnection of a
large-scale loop in the aftermath of the eruption and produces stronger
nonthermal emission up to $\gamma$-rays. In addition, this long-duration flare
reveals clear signs of ongoing magnetic reconnection during the decay phase,
evidenced by extended HXR bursts with energies up to 100--300 keV and
intermittent downflows of reconnected loops for >4 hours. The observations
reveal that the two-step flare reconnection substantially contributes to the

weighted graph $G_f$, defined by the LSCC measurement scheme, and show that the
phase retrievability of the signal $f$ is determined by the connectivity of
$G_f$. We then characterize the phase retrieval stability of the signal $f$ by
two measures that are commonly used in graph theory to quantify graph
connectivity: the Cheeger constant of $G_f$ for real valued signals, and the
algebraic connectivity of $G_f$ for complex valued signals.
  We use our results to study the stability of two phase retrieval models that
can be cast as LSCC measurement schemes, and focus on understanding for which
signals the ""curse of dimensionality"" can be avoided. The first model we
discuss is a finite-dimensional model for locally supported measurements such
as the windowed Fourier transform. For signals ""without large holes"", we show
the stability constant exhibits only a mild polynomial growth in the dimension,
in stark contrast with the exponential growth which uniform stability constants
tend to suffer from; more precisely, in $R^d$ the constant grows proportionally
to $d^{1/2}$, while in $C^d$ it grows proportionally to $d$. We also show the
growth of the constant in the complex case cannot be reduced, suggesting that
complex phase retrieval is substantially more difficult than real phase
retrieval. The second model we consider is an infinite-dimensional phase
retrieval problem in a principal shift invariant space. We show that despite
the infinite dimensionality of this model, signals with monotone exponential
decay will have a finite stability constant. In contrast, the stability bound
provided by our results will be infinite if the signal's decay is polynomial.

conducting (non-conducting) disk and ring configuration is studied in a
strongly magnetized radio-frequency (rf) discharge. A superconducting
electromagnet is used to introduce a homogeneous magnetic field to the dusty
plasma medium. In absence of the magnetic field, dust grains exhibit thermal
motion around their equilibrium position. The dust grains start to rotate in
anticlockwise direction with increasing magnetic field (B $>$ 0.02 T), and the
constant value of the angular frequency at various strengths of magnetic field
confirms the rigid body rotation. The angular frequency of dust grains linearly
increases up to a threshold magnetic field (B $>$ 0.6 T) and after that its
value remains nearly constant in a certain range of magnetic field. Further
increase in magnetic field (B $>$ 1 T) lowers the angular frequency. Low value
of angular frequency is expected by reducing the width of annulus dusty plasma
or the input rf power. The azimuthal ion drag force due to the magnetic field
is assumed to be the energy source which drives the rotational motion. The
resultant radial electric field in the presence of magnetic field determines
the direction of rotation. The variation of floating (plasma) potential across
the annular region at given magnetic field explains the rotational properties

order symmetries of relational structures -- polymorphisms -- to study the
complexity of the CSP. In this paper we further develop one of the methods the
algebraic approach can be implemented, and apply it to some kinds of the CSP.
This method was introduced in our LICS 2004 paper and involves the study of the
local structure of finite algebras and relational structures. It associates
with an algebra A or a relational structure S a graph, whose vertices are the
elements of A (or S), the edges represent subsets of A such that the
restriction of some term operation of A is `good' on the subset, that is, act
as an operation of one of the 3 types: semilattice, majority, or affine. In
this paper we use this theory and consider algebras with edges from a
restricted set of types. We prove type restrictions are preserved under the
standard algebraic constructions. Then we show that if the types edges in a
relational structure are restricted, then the corresponding CSP can be solved
in polynomial time by specific algorithms. In particular, we give a new,
somewhat more intuitive proof of the Bounded Width Theorem: the CSP over
algebra A has bounded width if and only if A does not contain affine edges.
Actually, this result shows that bounded width implies width (2,3). Finally, we
prove that algebras without semilattice edges have few subalgebras of powers,
that is, the CSP over such algebras is also polynomial time. The methods and
results obtained in this paper are important ingredients of the 2017 proof of

perceptual grouping routines involving contour integration. We introduce V1Net,
a bio-inspired recurrent unit that incorporates lateral connections ubiquitous
in cortical circuitry. Feedforward convolutional layers in DCNs can be
substituted with V1Net modules to enhance their contextual visual processing
support for perceptual grouping. We compare the learning efficiency and
accuracy of V1Net-DCNs to that of 14 carefully selected feedforward and
recurrent neural architectures (including state-of-the-art DCNs) on MarkedLong
-- a synthetic forced-choice contour integration dataset of 800,000 images we
introduce here -- and the previously published Pathfinder contour integration
benchmarks. We gauged solution generalizability by measuring the transfer
learning performance of our candidate models trained on MarkedLong that were
fine-tuned to learn PathFinder. Our results demonstrate that a compact 3-layer
V1Net-DCN matches or outperforms the test accuracy and sample efficiency of all
tested comparison models which contain between 5x and 1000x more trainable
parameters; we also note that V1Net-DCN learns the most compact generalizable
solution to MarkedLong. A visualization of the temporal dynamics of a V1Net-DCN
elucidates its usage of interpretable grouping computations to solve
MarkedLong. The compact and rich representations of V1Net-DCN also make it a
promising candidate to build on-device machine vision algorithms as well as

unitarity of the evolution. We reproduce and reinterpret these bulk results
from two different lower-dimensional perspectives: first as an interface CFT in
the usual AdS/CFT correspondence and second as an effective gravity theory in
one lower dimension coupled to a radiation background. In the limit where the
number of interface degrees of freedom becomes large, we obtain an effective
theory on appropriate branes that replace the deep interior region in the bulk,
coined the shadow region. In this effective theory, we also identify the island
of the radiation entanglement wedge and verify the newly proposed quantum
extremization method. Our model clarifies that double holography with gravity
in two higher dimensions can be realized in a concrete and consistent way and
that the occurrence of islands is natural in one higher dimension. Furthermore,
our model reveals that there can be a transitional behavior of the Page curve
before the Page time, which is related to the emergence of new matter degrees

  Identification","Accepted by SIGIR 2020. 10 pages",,,,"cs.IR cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Community Question Answering (CQA) has become a primary means for people to
acquire knowledge, where people are free to ask questions or submit answers. To
enhance the efficiency of the service, similar question identification becomes
a core task in CQA which aims to find a similar question from the archived
repository whenever a new question is asked. However, it has long been a
challenge to properly measure the similarity between two questions due to the
inherent variation of natural language, i.e., there could be different ways to
ask a same question or different questions sharing similar expressions. To
alleviate this problem, it is natural to involve the existing answers for the
enrichment of the archived questions. Traditional methods typically take a
one-side usage, which leverages the answer as some expanded representation of
the corresponding question. Unfortunately, this may introduce unexpected noises
into the similarity computation since answers are often long and diverse,
leading to inferior performance. In this work, we propose a two-side usage,
which leverages the answer as a bridge of the two questions. The key idea is
based on our observation that similar questions could be addressed by similar
parts of the answer while different questions may not. In other words, we can
compare the matching patterns of the two questions over the same answer to
measure their similarity. In this way, we propose a novel matching over
matching model, namely Match$^2$, which compares the matching patterns between
two question-answer pairs for similar question identification. Empirical
experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model can
significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods on the similar
question identification task.

absence of turbulence. However, in the presence of turbulence, the intensity
structures of such fields start to degrade because of the complete spatial

increase in the turbulence strength. On the other hand, several theoretical

we are given a function $f:\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^n$ and a nonlinearity
$\rho$. Can we specify the architecture, weights, and biases of all
feed-forward neural networks with respect to $\rho$ giving rise to $f$?
Existing literature on the subject suggests that the answer should be yes,
provided we are only concerned with finding networks that satisfy certain
""genericity conditions"". Moreover, the identified networks are mutually related
by symmetries of the nonlinearity. For instance, the $\tanh$ function is odd,
and so flipping the signs of the incoming and outgoing weights of a neuron does
not change the output map of the network. The results known hitherto, however,
apply either to single-layer networks, or to networks satisfying specific
structural assumptions (such as full connectivity), as well as to specific
nonlinearities. In an effort to answer the identifiability question in greater
generality, we consider arbitrary nonlinearities with potentially complicated
affine symmetries, and we show that the symmetries can be used to find a rich
set of networks giving rise to the same function $f$. The set obtained in this
manner is, in fact, exhaustive (i.e., it contains all networks giving rise to
$f$) unless there exists a network $\mathcal{A}$ ""with no internal symmetries""
giving rise to the identically zero function. This result can thus be
interpreted as an analog of the rank-nullity theorem for linear operators. We
furthermore exhibit a class of ""$\tanh$-type"" nonlinearities (including the
tanh function itself) for which such a network $\mathcal{A}$ does not exist,
thereby solving the identifiability question for these nonlinearities in full
generality. Finally, we show that this class contains nonlinearities with
arbitrarily complicated symmetries.

recursive equations and infinitary constructors. As in prior work, we describe
QIITs using a type theory where each context represents a QIIT signature.
However, in our case the theory of signatures can also describe its own
signature, modulo universe sizes. We bootstrap the model theory of signatures
using self-description and a Church-coded notion of signature, without using
complicated raw syntax or assuming an existing internal QIIT of signatures. We
give semantics to described QIITs by modeling each signature as a finitely
complete CwF (category with families) of algebras. Compared to the case of
finitary QIITs, we additionally need to show invariance under algebra
isomorphisms in the semantics. We do this by modeling signature types as
isofibrations. Finally, we show by a term model construction that every QIIT is
constructible from the syntax of the theory of signatures.

fully exploit 1) the weak supervision by considering informative and

liberalism, which attributes priority to the autonomy of the market economy and
tries to limit the role of government. In general, the core of every policy
program consists in an unfalsifiable worldview and a value judgment that remain
unchanged. On the other hand, a policy strategy with a protective belt
inevitably evolves owing to changes in reality and advances in scientific
knowledge. This is why the Keynesian policy strategy has shifted from being
fiscal-led to one that is monetary-led because of the influence of monetarism;
further, the Great Recession has even led to their integration.

and economic losses to countries around the world since the Spanish influenza
pandemic of 1918 (during World War I). It has resulted in enormous economic as
well as social costs, such as increased deaths from the spread of infection in
a region. This is because public regulations imposed by national and local
governments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate
suppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between
economic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public
interventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major
problem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts
certain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such
economic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time,
there is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt,
which is likely to increase economic burden in the future. However, as Paul
Samuelson once argued, much of the burden, whether due to public debt or
otherwise, can only be borne by the present generation, and not by future
generations.

limits of conditional normal models. Conditional normal models are
generalizations of conditional independence models, where the dependence among
observed variables is modeled using one unobserved factor. Conditional on this
factor, the distribution of these variables is given by the Gaussian copula.
This structure allows one to build flexible and parsimonious models for data
with complex dependence structures, such as data with spatial dependence or
factor structure. We study the extreme-value limits of these models and show
some interesting special cases of the proposed class of copulas. We develop
estimation methods for the proposed models and conduct a simulation study to
assess the performance of these algorithms. Finally, we apply these copula
models to analyze data on monthly wind maxima and stock return minima.

  JUNO","29 pages, 14 plots, 7 tables",,,,"hep-ex hep-ph physics.ins-det","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory~(JUNO) features a 20~kt
multi-purpose underground liquid scintillator sphere as its main detector. Some
of JUNO's features make it an excellent experiment for $^8$B solar neutrino
measurements, such as its low-energy threshold, its high energy resolution
compared to water Cherenkov detectors, and its much large target mass compared
to previous liquid scintillator detectors. In this paper we present a
comprehensive assessment of JUNO's potential for detecting $^8$B solar
neutrinos via the neutrino-electron elastic scattering process. A reduced 2~MeV
threshold on the recoil electron energy is found to be achievable assuming the
intrinsic radioactive background $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th in the liquid
scintillator can be controlled to 10$^{-17}$~g/g. With ten years of data
taking, about 60,000 signal and 30,000 background events are expected. This
large sample will enable an examination of the distortion of the recoil
electron spectrum that is dominated by the neutrino flavor transformation in
the dense solar matter, which will shed new light on the tension between the
measured electron spectra and the predictions of the standard three-flavor
neutrino oscillation framework. If $\Delta
m^{2}_{21}=4.8\times10^{-5}~(7.5\times10^{-5})$~eV$^{2}$, JUNO can provide
evidence of neutrino oscillation in the Earth at the about
3$\sigma$~(2$\sigma$) level by measuring the non-zero signal rate variation
with respect to the solar zenith angle. Moveover, JUNO can simultaneously
measure $\Delta m^2_{21}$ using $^8$B solar neutrinos to a precision of 20\% or
better depending on the central value and to sub-percent precision using
reactor antineutrinos. A comparison of these two measurements from the same
detector will help elucidate the current tension between the value of $\Delta
m^2_{21}$ reported by solar neutrino experiments and the KamLAND experiment.

$\Pi_\lambda$ associated to the Hermite operator $H=|x|^2-\Delta$ in $\mathbb

Hermite functions which are the eigenfunctions of $H$ with eigenvalue
$\lambda$. Such estimates were previously available only for $q=p'$,
equivalently with $p=2$ or $q=2$ (by $TT^*$ argument) except for the estimates
which are straightforward consequences of interpolation between those
estimates. As shown in the works of Karadzhov, Thangavelu, and Koch and Tataru,
the local and global estimates for $\Pi_\lambda$ are of different nature.
Especially, $\Pi_\lambda$ exhibits complicated behaviors near the set
$\sqrt\lambda\mathbb S^{d-1}$. Compared with the spectral projection operator
associated to the Laplacian, $L^p$-$L^q$ estimate for $\Pi_\lambda$ is not so
well understood up to now for general $p,q$. In this paper we consider
$L^p$--$L^q$ estimate for $\Pi_\lambda$ in a general framework including the
local and global estimates with $1\le p\le 2\le q\le \infty$ and undertake the
work of characterizing the sharp bounds on $\Pi_\lambda$. We establish various
new sharp estimates in extended ranges of $p,q$. First of all, we provide a
complete characterization of the local estimate for $\Pi_\lambda$ which was
first considered by Thangavelu. Secondly, for $d\ge5$, we prove the endpoint
$L^2$--$L^{2(d+3)/(d+1)}$ estimate for $\Pi_\lambda$ which has been left open
since the work of Koch and Tataru. Thirdly, we extend the range of $p,q$ for
which the operator $\Pi_\lambda$ is uniformly bounded from $L^p$ to $L^q$.

hexagonal network with an unique energy scale
$\epsilon_p=\frac{e^2}{\epsilon_0\epsilon t_0}$ with $t_0$ the moir\'e lattice

density of states at zero energy, and (ii) the presence of a plasmonic Dirac
cone at $\hbar\omega\sim\epsilon_p/2$ with sound velocity $v_D=0.0075c$, which
is formed by zigzag and armchair current oscillations. A network model reveals
that the antisymmetry of the plasmon bands implies that CEP scatter at the
hexagon vertices maximally in the deflected chiral outgoing directions, with a
current ratio of 4/9 into each of the deflected directions and 1/9 into the
forward one. We show that scanning near-field microscopy should be able to

induced map, we can apply observables on the weight space and measure their
evolution. The evolution of the observables are given by the Koopman operator
associated with the induced dynamical system. We use the spectrum and modes of
the Koopman operator to realize the above objectives. Our methods can help to,
a priori, determine the network depth; determine if we have a bad
initialization of the network weights, allowing a restart before training too
long; speeding up the training time. Additionally, our methods help enable
noise rejection and improve robustness. We show how the Koopman spectrum can be
used to determine the number of layers required for the architecture.
Additionally, we show how we can elucidate the convergence versus
non-convergence of the training process by monitoring the spectrum, in
particular, how the existence of eigenvalues clustering around 1 determines
when to terminate the learning process. We also show how using Koopman modes we
can selectively prune the network to speed up the training procedure. Finally,
we show that incorporating loss functions based on negative Sobolev norms can
allow for the reconstruction of a multi-scale signal polluted by very large

algorithm for black-box functions which are expensive to evaluate. Existing
literature on model based optimization in conditional parameter spaces are
usually built on trees. In this work, we generalize the additive assumption to
tree-structured functions and propose an additive tree-structured covariance
function, showing improved sample-efficiency, wider applicability and greater
flexibility. Furthermore, by incorporating the structure information of
parameter spaces and the additive assumption in the BO loop, we develop a
parallel algorithm to optimize the acquisition function and this optimization
can be performed in a low dimensional space. We demonstrate our method on an
optimization benchmark function, as well as on a neural network model
compression problem, and experimental results show our approach significantly
outperforms the current state of the art for conditional parameter optimization
including SMAC, TPE and Jenatton et al. (2017).

viewing the two proposed algorithms as accelerated variants of the Forward
Backward algorithm to solve monotone inclusions associated with the
decentralized optimization problem. We also verify the efficacy of our methods

We show that the new variance expression can be efficiently approximated

impact, this paper explores a model for how the golf club moves near to impact.
It assumes the golf club is moving as the distal arm of a double pendulum. At
impact the club head is moving straight down the target line, at its maximum
speed, on a path with a specified radius of curvature. From this model the
forces and torques required to move the club near to impact are calculated. The
negative couple near to impact is a robust feature of this model, balancing the
torque associated with the force that drives the center of mass of the golf
club. The negative couple allows the golfer to maintain a larger radius of
curvature of the path of the club head as it moves through impact.
  Because the negative couple can also serve to reduce the rotational speed of
the club, the presence of a negative couple at impact in the golf swing
manifests a trade between distance and direction.

emergence patches erode the coronal hole and transform the area into a more
quiet-Sun-like area, whereby bipolar magnetic structures play an important
role. Conversely, flux cancellation leads to the reduction of opposite-polarity
magnetic fields and to an increase in the area of the coronal hole.

associated magnetic flux and the aforementioned area evolution in the EUV, are

challenging since self-created inter carrier interference (ICI) exists, which

with the classification task without domain-knowledge at the cost of training
complexity since neural network hyperparameters have to be extensively tuned.
Previous work showed that a tremendously trained convolutional neural network
(CNN) classifier can efficiently identify feature-diversity dominant signals
while it failed when feature-similarity dominates. Therefore, a pre-processing
strategy, which can amplify signal feature diversity is of great importance.
This work applies single-level wavelet transform to manually extract
time-frequency features from non-orthogonal signals. Composite statistical
features are investigated and the wavelet enabled two-dimensional
time-frequency feature grid is further simplified into a one-dimensional
feature vector via proper statistical transform. The dimensionality reduced
features are fed to an error-correcting output codes (ECOC) model, consisting
of multiple binary support vector machine (SVM) learners, for multiclass signal
classification. Low-cost experiments reveal 100% classification accuracy for
feature-diversity dominant signals and 90% for feature-similarity dominant
signals, which is nearly 28% accuracy improvement when compared with the CNN
classification results.

problem and approximate methods are usually used. One of the most common
methods is the spherical harmonics method (the $P_N$ approximation), when the
exact transport equation is replaced with a closed set of equations for the
moments of the density, with some closure assumption. Unfortunately, the
classic $P_N$ closure yields poor results with low-order $N$ in highly
anisotropic problems. Specifically, the tails of the particle's positional
distribution as attained by the $P_N$ approximation, are inaccurate compared to
the true behavior. In this work we present a derivation of a linear closure
that even for low-order approximation yields a solution that is superior to the
classical $P_N$ approximation. This closure, is based on an asymptotic
derivation, both for space and time, of the exact Boltzmann equation in
infinite homogeneous media. We test this approximation with respect to the
one-dimensional benchmark of the full Green function in infinite media. The
convergence of the proposed approximation is also faster when compared to

transmission for channel estimation can be prohibitive in wideband massive
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. This can degrade the overall
spectral efficiency significantly, and as a result, curtail the potential
benefits of massive MIMO. In this paper, we propose a neural network (NN)-based
joint pilot design and downlink channel estimation scheme for frequency
division duplex (FDD) MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM)
systems. The proposed NN architecture uses fully connected layers for
frequency-aware pilot design, and outperforms linear minimum mean square error
(LMMSE) estimation by exploiting inherent correlations in MIMO channel matrices
utilizing convolutional NN layers. Our proposed NN architecture uses a
non-local attention module to learn longer range correlations in the channel
matrix to further improve the channel estimation performance. We also propose
an effective pilot reduction technique by gradually pruning less significant
neurons from the dense NN layers during training. This constitutes a novel
application of NN pruning to reduce the pilot transmission overhead. Our
pruning-based pilot reduction technique reduces the overhead by allocating
pilots across subcarriers non-uniformly and exploiting the inter-frequency and
inter-antenna correlations in the channel matrix efficiently through
convolutional layers and attention module.

interest and need in monitoring and analyzing urban flood events. Social media,
as a new data source, can provide real-time information for flood monitoring.
The social media posts with locations are often referred to as Volunteered
Geographic Information (VGI), which can reveal the spatial pattern of such
events. Since more images are shared on social media than ever before, recent
research focused on the extraction of flood-related posts by analyzing images
in addition to texts. Apart from merely classifying posts as flood relevant or
not, more detailed information, e.g. the flood severity, can also be extracted
based on image interpretation. However, it has been less tackled and has not
yet been applied for flood severity mapping.
  In this paper, we propose a novel three-step process to extract and map flood
severity information. First, flood relevant images are retrieved with the help
of pre-trained convolutional neural networks as feature extractors. Second, the
images containing people are further classified into four severity levels by
observing the relationship between body parts and their partial inundation,
i.e. images are classified according to the water level with respect to
different body parts, namely ankle, knee, hip, and chest. Lastly, locations of
the Tweets are used for generating a map of estimated flood extent and
severity. This process was applied to an image dataset collected during
Hurricane Harvey in 2017, as a proof of concept. The results show that VGI can
be used as a supplement to remote sensing observations for flood extent mapping
and is beneficial, especially for urban areas, where the infrastructure is
often occluding water. Based on the extracted water level information, an
integrated overview of flood severity can be provided for the early stages of
emergency response.

challenges inherent in the construction of a machine-learning (ML) framework
aimed at predicting the DOS as a combination of local contributions that depend
in turn on the geometric configuration of neighbours around each atom, using
quasiparticle energy levels from density functional theory as training data. We
present a challenging case study that includes configurations of silicon
spanning a broad set of thermodynamic conditions, ranging from bulk structures
to clusters, and from semiconducting to metallic behavior. We compare different
approaches to represent the DOS, and the accuracy of predicting quantities such
as the Fermi level, the DOS at the Fermi level, or the band energy, either
directly or as a side-product of the evaluation of the DOS. The performance of
the model depends crucially on the smoothening of the DOS, and there is a
tradeoff to be made between the systematic error associated with the
smoothening and the error in the ML model for a specific structure. We
demonstrate the usefulness of this approach by computing the density of states
of a large amorphous silicon sample, for which it would be prohibitively
expensive to compute the DOS by direct electronic structure calculations, and
show how the atom-centred decomposition of the DOS that is obtained through our
model can be used to extract physical insights into the connections between
structural and electronic features.

algorithms come with more and more tunable parameters. It is common to tune

these techniques: how large should the training set be to ensure that a

a ""simple"" function. We show that if this approximation holds under the
L-infinity norm, we can provide strong sample complexity bounds. On the flip
side, if the approximation holds only under the L-p norm for p smaller than
infinity, it is not possible to provide meaningful sample complexity bounds in
the worst case. We empirically evaluate our bounds in the context of integer

experiments, we obtain sample complexity bounds that are up to 700 times

investigate the assembly history of the Fornax A group and to compare its
physical quantities as a function of the environment to that of the Fornax
cluster core. For all galaxies, we extract the azimuthally averaged surface
brightness profiles in three optical bands (g, r, i) by modelling the galaxy's
isophotes. We derive their colour profiles and structural parameters in all
respective bands. The long integration time and large covered area of the FDS
allow us to also estimate the amount of IGL. The majority of galaxies in the
Fornax A group are late-type galaxies (LTGs), spanning a range of stellar mass
of $8 < log (M_* M_{\odot}) < 10.5$. Six out of nine LTGs show a Type III
(up-bending) break in their light profiles, which is either suggestive of
strangulation halting star-formation in their outskirts or their HI-richness
causing enhanced star-formation in their outer-discs. The estimated luminosity
of the IGL is $6 \pm 2 \times 10^{10} L_{\odot}$ in g-band, which corresponds
to about 16% of the total light in the group. The Fornax A group appears to be
in an early stage of assembly with respect to the cluster core. The environment
of the Fornax A group is not as dense as that of the cluster core, with all
galaxies except the BGG showing similar morphology, comparable colours and
stellar masses, and Type III disc-breaks, without any clear trend of these
properties with group-centric distances. The main contribution to the IGL is
from the minor merging in the outskirts of the BGG NGC1316 and, probably, the
disrupted dwarf galaxies close to the group centre.

assessment of cultural ecosystem services (CES). Most studies have focused on
the use of single SM platforms and on the analysis of photo content to assess
the demand for CES. Here, we introduce a novel methodology for the assessment
of CES using SM data through the application of graph theory network analyses
(GTNA) on hashtags associated to SM posts and compare it to photo content
analysis. We applied the proposed methodology on two SM platforms, Instagram
and Twitter, on three worldwide known case study areas, namely Great Barrier
Reef, Galapagos Islands and Easter Island. Our results indicate that the
analysis of hashtags through graph theory offers similar capabilities to photo
content analysis in the assessment of CES provision and the identification of
CES providers. More importantly, GTNA provides greater capabilities at
identifying relational values and eudaimonic aspects associated to nature,
elusive aspects for photo content analysis. In addition, GTNA contributes to
the reduction of the interpreter's bias associated to photo content analyses,
since GTNA is based on the tags provided by the users themselves. The study
also highlights the importance of considering data from different social media
platforms, as the type of users and the information offered by these platforms
can show different CES attributes. The ease of application and short computing
processing times involved in the application of GTNA makes it a cost-effective
method with the potential of being applied to large geographical scales.

expensive computational fluid dynamics simulations because of the high
dimensionality of the design space. One approach to combat this problem is to
reduce the design space dimension by obtaining a new representation. This
requires a parametric function that compactly and sufficiently describes useful
variation in shapes. We propose a deep generative model, B\'ezier-GAN, to
parameterize aerodynamic designs by learning from shape variations in an
existing database. The resulted new parameterization can accelerate design
optimization convergence by improving the representation compactness while
maintaining sufficient representation capacity. We use the airfoil design as an
example to demonstrate the idea and analyze B\'ezier-GAN's representation
capacity and compactness. Results show that B\'ezier-GAN both (1) learns smooth
and realistic shape representations for a wide range of airfoils and (2)
empirically accelerates optimization convergence by at least two times compared

tasks. Most state-of-the-art (SOTA) semantic segmentation and object detection
approaches reuse neural network architectures designed for image classification
as the backbone, commonly pre-trained on ImageNet. However, performance gains
can be achieved by designing network architectures specifically for detection
and segmentation, as shown by recent neural architecture search (NAS) research
for detection and segmentation. One major challenge though is that ImageNet
pre-training of the search space representation (a.k.a. super network) or the
searched networks incurs huge computational cost. In this paper, we propose a
Fast Network Adaptation (FNA++) method, which can adapt both the architecture
and parameters of a seed network (e.g. an ImageNet pre-trained network) to
become a network with different depths, widths, or kernel sizes via a parameter
remapping technique, making it possible to use NAS for segmentation and
detection tasks a lot more efficiently. In our experiments, we apply FNA++ on
MobileNetV2 to obtain new networks for semantic segmentation, object detection,
and human pose estimation that clearly outperform existing networks designed
both manually and by NAS. We also implement FNA++ on ResNets and NAS networks,
which demonstrates a great generalization ability. The total computation cost
of FNA++ is significantly less than SOTA segmentation and detection NAS
approaches: 1737x less than DPC, 6.8x less than Auto-DeepLab, and 8.0x less
than DetNAS. A series of ablation studies are performed to demonstrate the
effectiveness, and detailed analysis is provided for more insights into the
working mechanism. Codes are available at https://github.com/JaminFong/FNA.

strongly elliptic second order systems in divergence form on a domains above a
Lipschitz graph, satisfying $L^p$-boundary data for $p$ near $2$. The main
novel aspect of our result is that it applies to operators with coefficients of
limited regularity and applies to operators satisfying a natural Carleson
condition that has been first considered in the scalar case.
  In this paper we extend this result in several directions. We improve the
range of solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem to the interval
$2-\varepsilon < p<\frac{2(n-1)}{(n-3)}+\varepsilon$, for systems in dimension
$n=2,3$ in the range $2-\varepsilon < p<\infty$. We do this by considering
solvability of the Regularity problem (with boundary data having one derivative
in $L^p$) in the range $2-\varepsilon < p<2+\varepsilon$.
  Secondly, we look at perturbation type-results where we can deduce
solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem for one operator from known $L^p$
Dirichlet solvability of a \lq\lq close"" operator (in the sense of Carleson
measure). This leads to improvement of the main result of the paper
arXiv:1708.02289; we establish solvability of the $L^p$ Dirichlet problem in
the interval $2-\varepsilon < p<\frac{2(n-1)}{(n-2)}+\varepsilon$ under a much
weaker (oscillation-type) Carleson condition.
  A particular example of the system where all these results apply is the
Lam\'e operator for isotropic inhomogeneous materials with Poisson ratio
$\nu<0.396$. In this specific case further improvements of the solvability
range are possible, see the upcoming work with J. Li and J. Pipher.

the encryption process. Input information is hidden in this target phase of
d-ary features for attribute obfuscation. Even if attackers have obtained
network parameters and intermediate-layer features, they cannot extract input
information without knowing the target phase. Hence, the input privacy can be
effectively protected by the RENN. Besides, the output accuracy of RENNs only
degrades mildly compared to traditional neural networks, and the computational
cost is significantly less than the homomorphic encryption.

crucial to appropriately select the cloud nodes to deploy the functions in the
SFC and flexibly route the flow of the services such that these functions are

expansions. $\Pi$-Nets are polynomial neural networks, i.e., the output is a
high-order polynomial of the input. The unknown parameters, which are naturally
represented by high-order tensors, are estimated through a collective tensor
factorization with factors sharing. We introduce three tensor decompositions
that significantly reduce the number of parameters and show how they can be
efficiently implemented by hierarchical neural networks. We empirically
demonstrate that $\Pi$-Nets are very expressive and they even produce good
results without the use of non-linear activation functions in a large battery
of tasks and signals, i.e., images, graphs, and audio. When used in conjunction
with activation functions, $\Pi$-Nets produce state-of-the-art results in three
challenging tasks, i.e. image generation, face verification and 3D mesh
representation learning. The source code is available at

sophistication and robustness exceeding the capabilities of current
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models. The necessary capability can
often be provided by well-resolved large eddy simulation (LES), but, for many
flows of interest, such simulations are too computationally intensive to be
performed routinely. In principle, hybrid RANS/LES (HRL) models capable of
transitioning through arbitrary levels of modeled and resolved turbulence would
ameliorate both RANS deficiencies and LES expense. However, these HRL
approaches have led to a host of unique complications, in addition to those
already present in RANS and LES. This work proposes a modeling approach aimed
at overcoming such challenges. The approach presented here relies on splitting
the turbulence model into three distinct components: two responsible for the
standard subgrid model roles of either providing the unresolved stress or
dissipation and a third which reduces the model length scale by creating
resolved turbulence. This formulation renders blending functions unnecessary in
HRL. Further, the split-model approach both reduces the physics-approximation
burden on simple eddy-viscosity-based models and provides convenient
flexibility in model selection. In regions where the resolution is adequate to
support additional turbulence, fluctuations are generated at the smallest
locally resolved scales of motion. This active forcing drives the system
towards a balance between RANS and grid-resolved LES for any combination of
resolution and flow while the split-model formulation prevents local disruption
to the total stress. The model is demonstrated on fully-developed,
incompressible channel flow [1] and the periodic hill [2], in which it is shown
to produce accurate results and avoid common HRL shortcomings, such as model
stress depletion.

  Influence Functions",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are instrumental in modelling sequential and
time-series data. Yet, when using RNNs to inform decision-making, predictions
by themselves are not sufficient; we also need estimates of predictive
uncertainty. Existing approaches for uncertainty quantification in RNNs are
based predominantly on Bayesian methods; these are computationally prohibitive,
and require major alterations to the RNN architecture and training.
Capitalizing on ideas from classical jackknife resampling, we develop a
frequentist alternative that: (a) does not interfere with model training or
compromise its accuracy, (b) applies to any RNN architecture, and (c) provides
theoretical coverage guarantees on the estimated uncertainty intervals. Our
method derives predictive uncertainty from the variability of the (jackknife)
sampling distribution of the RNN outputs, which is estimated by repeatedly
deleting blocks of (temporally-correlated) training data, and collecting the
predictions of the RNN re-trained on the remaining data. To avoid exhaustive
re-training, we utilize influence functions to estimate the effect of removing
training data blocks on the learned RNN parameters. Using data from a critical
care setting, we demonstrate the utility of uncertainty quantification in
sequential decision-making.

cloud resources closer to the end user improving responsiveness and reducing

dominant dynamic features of edge networks. Temporal and social features of
content, such as the number of views and likes are leveraged to estimate the
popularity of content from a global perspective. However, such estimates should
not be mapped to an edge network with particular social and geographic
characteristics. In next generation edge networks, i.e., 5G and beyond 5G,
machine learning techniques can be applied to predict content popularity based
on user preferences, cluster users based on similar content interests, and
optimize cache placement and replacement strategies provided a set of
constraints and predictions about the state of the network. These applications
of machine learning can help identify relevant content for an edge network.
This article investigates the application of machine learning techniques for
in-network caching in edge networks. We survey recent state-of-the-art
literature and formulate a comprehensive taxonomy based on (a) machine learning
technique (method, objective, and features), (b) caching strategy (policy,
location, and replacement), and (c) edge network (type and delivery strategy).
A comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art literature is presented with
respect to the parameters identified in the taxonomy. Moreover, we debate
research challenges and future directions for optimal caching decisions and the
application of machine learning in edge networks.

based on docking, a popular computational method for assessing molecule binding
to a protein. Concretely, the goal is to generate drug-like molecules that are
scored highly by SMINA, a popular docking software. We observe that popular
graph-based generative models fail to generate molecules with a high docking
score when trained using a realistically sized training set. This suggests a
limitation of the current incarnation of models for de novo drug design.
Finally, we propose a simplified version of the benchmark based on a simpler

droop, allowing LEDs brightness to increase linearly with injected current.
With record current densities of 1000 KA/cm2 (100 mA), the LEDs transition to
lasing within the fin, with high brightness. Despite a light extraction
efficiency of only 15%, these devices exceed the output power of any previous
