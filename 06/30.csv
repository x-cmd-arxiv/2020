WIMP-like state into a pair of dark matter particles that are self-interacting
via exchange of a light mediator. Its distinctive thermal history allows the
mediator to be stable and therefore avoid strong limits from the cosmic
microwave background and indirect detection. A natural by-product of this
mechanism is a possibility of a late time, i.e., after recombination,
transition to subdominant dark radiation component through three-body and
one-loop decays to states containing the light mediator. We examine to what
extent such a process can help to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. Additionally,
the mechanism can provide a natural way of constructing dark matter models with
ultra-strong self-interactions that may positively affect the supermassive
black hole formation rate. We provide a simple realization of the mechanism in
a Higgs portal dark matter model and find a significant region of the parameter
space that leads to a mild relaxation of the Hubble tension while
simultaneously having the potential of addressing small-scale structure
problems of $\Lambda$CDM.

Here, we outline the adequacy of consent for data transactions. Informed by the
shortcomings of individual consent, we introduce both a platform-specific model
of ""distributed consent"" and a cross-platform model of a ""consent passport."" In
both models, individuals and groups can coordinate by giving consent
conditional on that of their network connections. We simulate the impact of
these distributed consent models on the observability of social networks and
find that low adoption would allow macroscopic subsets of networks to preserve

Standard
FW suffers from slow convergence: iterates often zig-zag as update directions
oscillate around extreme points of the constraint set. The new variant, $k$FW,
overcomes this problem by using two stronger subproblem oracles in each
iteration. The first is a $k$ linear optimization oracle ($k$LOO) that computes
the $k$ best update directions (rather than just one). The second is a $k$
direction search ($k$DS) that minimizes the objective over a constraint set
represented by the $k$ best update directions and the previous iterate. When
the problem solution admits a sparse representation, both oracles are easy to
compute, and $k$FW converges quickly for smooth convex objectives and several
interesting constraint sets: $k$FW achieves finite
$\frac{4L_f^3D^4}{\gamma\delta^2}$ convergence on polytopes and group norm
balls, and linear convergence on spectrahedra and nuclear norm balls. Numerical
experiments validate the effectiveness of $k$FW and demonstrate an

some discrepancies in the inferred parameter constraints have manifested among
a number of cosmological data sets. These include a tension between the
expansion rate of our Cosmos as inferred from the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) and as found from local measurements, the preference for an enhanced
amplitude of CMB lensing, a somewhat low quadrupole moment of the CMB
fluctuations as well as a preference for a lower amplitude of matter
fluctuations in large-scale structure surveys than inferred from the CMB. We
analyse these observational tensions under the addition of spatial curvature
and a free CMB background temperature that may deviate from its locally
measured value. With inclusion of these parameters, we observe a trend in the
parameter constraints from CMB and baryon acoustic oscillation data towards an
open and hotter universe with larger current expansion rate, standard CMB
lensing amplitudes, lower amplitude of matter fluctuations, and marginally
lower CMB quadrupole moment, consistently reducing the individual tensions
among the cosmological data sets. Combining this data with local distance
measurements, we find a preference for an open and hotter universe beyond the
99.7% confidence level. Finally, we briefly discuss a local void as a possible
source for a deviation of the locally measured CMB temperature from its
background value and as mimic of negative spatial curvature for CMB photons.
This interpretation implies a $\sim$20% underdensity in our local neighbourhood
of $\sim$10-100 Mpc in diameter, which is well within cosmic variance.

Neural network methods defined a new state-of-the-art for address parsing.
While this approach yielded notable results, previous work has only focused on
applying neural networks to achieve address parsing of addresses from one

transferring the address parsing knowledge obtained by training on some
countries' addresses to others with no further training in a zero-shot transfer

practical importance to obtain estimators for these models that are robust
against high-leverage outliers, which are generally difficult to identify and
may cause serious damage to least squares and Huber-type $M$-estimators. For
that reason, robust estimators for semi-functional linear regression models are
constructed combining $B$-splines to approximate both the functional regression
parameter and the nonparametric component with robust regression estimators
based on a bounded loss function and a preliminary residual scale estimator.
Consistency and rates of convergence for the proposed estimators are derived
under mild regularity conditions. The reported numerical experiments show the
advantage of the proposed methodology over the classical least squares and
Huber-type $M$-estimators for finite samples. The analysis of real examples
illustrate that the robust estimators provide better predictions for
non-outlying points than the classical ones, and that when potential outliers
are removed from the training and test sets both methods behave very similarly.

based on a choice of a vertically Riemannian submersion $\pi$ over $M$ equipped
with a flat Ehresmann connection, which determines the non-linear section sigma
model of the theory, and a choice of flat symplectic vector bundle
$\mathcal{S}$ equipped with a positive complex polarization over the total
space of $\pi$, which encodes the inverse gauge couplings and theta angles of
the theory and determines its gauge sector. The classical fields of the theory
consist of Lorentzian metrics on $M$, global sections of $\pi$ and two-forms
valued in $\mathcal{S}$ that satisfy an algebraic relation which defines the
notion of \emph{twisted} self-duality in four Lorentzian dimensions. We use
this geometric formulation to investigate the group of electromagnetic duality

in devices, circuits and information processing. Key to their promising
potentials is that magnons are highly tunable excitations and can be easily
engineered to couple with various dynamic media and platforms. The capability
of reaching strong coupling with many different excitations has positioned
magnons well for studying solid-state coherent dynamics and exploiting unique
functionality. In addition, with their gigahertz frequency bandwidth and the
ease of fabrication and miniaturization, magnonic devices and systems can be
conveniently integrated into microwave circuits for mimicking a broad range of
device concepts that have been applied in microwave electronics, photonics and

algorithm for MTdc systems is proposed to detect a broad range of failures.
Sensor measurements, i.e., line currents and dc reactor voltages measured at
local terminals, are first processed by a top-level context clustering
algorithm. For each cluster, the best fault detector is selected among a
detector pool according to a rule resulting from a learning algorithm. The
detector pool consists of several existing detection algorithms, each
performing differently across fault scenarios. The proposed hybrid primary
detection algorithm: i) detects all major fault types including pole-to-pole
(P2P), pole-to-ground (P2G), and external dc fault; ii) provides a wide
detection region covering faults with various fault locations and impedances;
iii) is more robust to noisy sensor measurements compared to the existing
methods. Performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm are evaluated
and verified based on time-domain simulations in the PSCAD/EMTDC software

large-scale Knowledge Graphs (KGs), on the grounds that representing
regularities as rules enables both the interpretable inference of new facts,
and the explanation of known facts. Among these systems, the walk-based methods
that generate the instantiated rules containing constants by abstracting
sampled paths in KGs demonstrate strong predictive performance and
expressivity. However, due to the large volume of possible rules, these systems
do not scale well where computational resources are often wasted on generating
and evaluating unpromising rules. In this work, we address such scalability
issues by proposing new methods for pruning unpromising rules using rule
hierarchies. The approach consists of two phases. Firstly, since rule
hierarchies are not readily available in walk-based methods, we have built a
Rule Hierarchy Framework (RHF), which leverages a collection of subsumption
frameworks to build a proper rule hierarchy from a set of learned rules. And
secondly, we adapt RHF to an existing rule learner where we design and
implement two methods for Hierarchical Pruning (HPMs), which utilize the
generated hierarchies to remove irrelevant and redundant rules. Through
experiments over four public benchmark datasets, we show that the application
of HPMs is effective in removing unpromising rules, which leads to significant
reductions in the runtime as well as in the number of learned rules, without
compromising the predictive performance.

potential for sentence modeling. There are two main neural network structures:
recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolution neural network (CNN). RNN can
capture long term dependencies and store the semantics of the previous
information in a fixed-sized vector. However, RNN is a biased model and its
ability to extract global semantics is restricted by the fixed-sized vector.
Alternatively, CNN is able to capture n-gram features of texts by utilizing
convolutional filters. But the width of convolutional filters restricts its
performance. In order to combine the strengths of the two kinds of networks and
alleviate their shortcomings, this paper proposes Attention-based Multichannel
Convolutional Neural Network (AMCNN) for text classification. AMCNN utilizes a
bi-directional long short-term memory to encode the history and future
information of words into high dimensional representations, so that the
information of both the front and back of the sentence can be fully expressed.
Then the scalar attention and vectorial attention are applied to obtain
multichannel representations. The scalar attention can calculate the word-level
importance and the vectorial attention can calculate the feature-level
importance. In the classification task, AMCNN uses a CNN structure to cpture
word relations on the representations generated by the scalar and vectorial
attention mechanism instead of calculating the weighted sums. It can
effectively extract the n-gram features of the text. The experimental results
on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMCNN achieves better performance
than state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the visualization results verify
the semantic richness of multichannel representations.

the requantized local binary patterns (LBP) histogram around the pixel to be
classified are used as features which represent both the spatial and temporal
information replicated in the video. Experiments conducted on the challenging
SynthDB dataset show that, contrary to current dynamic texture segmentation
approaches that either require parameter estimation or a training step, ULCM is
significantly faster, easier to code, simple and has limited parameters.
Further qualitative experiments based on the YUP++ dataset prove the
efficiently and competitively of the ULCM.

occurrence of a strong phase transition from hadronic matter to deconfined
quark matter in neutron star mergers. Such a phase transition leads to a strong
softening of the equation of state and hence to more compact merger remnants
compared to purely hadronic models. If a phase transition takes place during
merging, this results in a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger
gravitational-wave frequency relative to the tidal deformability characterizing
the inspiral phase. By comparing results from different purely hadronic and
hybrid models we show that a strong phase transition can be identified from a
single, simultaneous measurement of pre- and postmerger gravitational waves.
Furthermore, we present new results for hybrid star mergers, which contain
quark matter already during the inspiral stage. Also for these systems we find
that the postmerger GW frequency is increased compared to purely hadronic
models. We thus conclude that also hybrid star mergers with an onset of the
hadron-quark phase transition at relatively low densities may lead to the very
same characteristic signature of quark deconfinement in the postmerger GW
signal as systems undergoing the phase transition during merging.

efficient approach to address that challenge via the analytical deep

for developing a computationally cheap surrogate model to replace the original
time-consuming differential-algebraic constraints related to TTC. However, the
deep learning-based surrogate model introduces implicit rules that are
difficult to handle in the optimization process. To this end, we derive the
Jacobian and Hessian matrices of the implicit surrogate models and finally
transfer them into an analytical formulation that can be easily solved by the
interior point method. Surrogate modeling and problem reformulation allow us to
achieve significantly improved computational efficiency and the yielded
solutions can be used for operational planning. Numerical results carried out
on the modified IEEE 39-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness of the

powerful but untrustable prover who tries to convince them, in a small number
of rounds and through short messages, that G satisfies some property. This
series of interactions is followed by a phase of distributed verification,
which may be either deterministic or randomized, where nodes exchange messages
with their neighbors.
  The nature of this last verification round defines the two types of
interactive protocols. We say that the protocol is of Arthur-Merlin type if the
verification round is deterministic. We say that the protocol is of
Merlin-Arthur type if, in the verification round, the nodes are allowed to use
a fresh set of random bits.
  In the original model introduced by Kol, Oshman, and Saxena [PODC 2018], the
randomness was private in the sense that each node had only access to an
individual source of random coins. Crescenzi, Fraigniaud, and Paz [DISC 2019]
initiated the study of the impact of shared randomness (the situation where the
coin tosses are visible to all nodes) in the distributed interactive model.
  In this work, we continue that research line by showing that the impact of
the two forms of randomness is very different depending on whether we are
considering Arthur-Merlin protocols or Merlin-Arthur protocols. While private
randomness gives more power to the first type of protocols, shared randomness
provides more power to the second. Our results also connect shared randomness
in distributed interactive proofs with distributed verification, and new lower
bounds are obtained.

However, its convergence rate can be significantly reduced if the target
distribution is a mixture of multiple densities, especially when each component
concentrates around a different mode. Replica exchange Langevin diffusion
(ReLD) is a sampling method that can circumvent this issue. In particular, ReLD
adds another LD sampling a high-temperature version of the target density, and
exchange the locations of two LDs according to a Metropolis-Hasting type of
law. This approach can be further extended to multiple replica exchange
Langevin diffusion (mReLD), where $K$ additional LDs are added to sample
distributions at different temperatures and exchanges take place between
neighboring-temperature processes. While ReLD and mReLD have been used
extensively in statistical physics, molecular dynamics, and other applications,
there is little existing analysis on its convergence rate and choices of
temperatures. This paper closes these gaps assuming the target distribution is
a mixture of log-concave densities. We show ReLD can obtain constant or even
better convergence rates even when the density components of the mixture
concentrate around isolated modes. We also show using mReLD with $K$ additional
LDs can achieve the same result while the exchange frequency only needs to be

environmental variation in artificial evolutionary systems. To illustrate and
explore the effects of different noise colours, a simple evolutionary model
that examines the trade-off between specialism and generalism in fluctuating

for greater generalism as environmental variability becomes `whiter', whilst
specialisation is favoured as environmental variability becomes `redder'. Pink
noise, sitting midway between white and red noise, is shown to be the point at
which the pressures for generalism and specialism balance, providing some
insight in to why `pinker' noise is increasingly being seen as an appropriate

Although often dismissed as `ideal gas-like' and therefore simple, states
occurring in stellar matter are dense plasmas, and the EOS has not been
established precisely. EOS constructed using multi-physics approaches found
necessary for laboratory studies of warm dense matter give significant
variations in stellar regimes, and vary from the EOS commonly used in
simulations of the formation and evolution of stars. We have investigated the
sensitivity of such simulations to variations in the EOS, for sun-like and
low-mass stars, and found a strong sensitivity of the lifetime of the Sun and
of the lower luminosity limit for red dwarfs. We also found a significant
sensitivity in the lower mass limit for red dwarfs. Simulations of this type
are also used for other purposes in astrophysics, including the interpretation
of absolute magnitude as mass, the conversion of inferred mass distribution to
the initial mass function using predicted lifetimes, simulations of star
formation from nebulae, simulations of galactic evolution, and the baryon
census used to bound the exotic contribution to dark matter. Although many of
the sensitivities of stellar physics to the EOS are large, some of the inferred
astrophysical quantities are also constrained by independent measurements,
although the constraints may be indirect and non-trivial. However, it may be
possible to use such measurements to constrain the EOS more than presently
possible by established plasma theory.

arises from the asymmetric participation of local modes in the long-lived

how quantum correlations persistently exceed classical correlations during the

rates, are unknown. Our method scans the entire parameter space, and rejects
parameter values using the joint data density as the test statistic. The
proposed method is conservative for marginal inference, in general, but its key
advantage over more standard approaches is that it is valid in finite samples
even when the underlying model is not point identified. Moreover, our method
requires only independence of serology test results, and does not rely on
asymptotic arguments, normality assumptions, or other approximations. We use
recent Covid-19 serology studies in the US, and show that the parameter
confidence set is generally wide, and cannot support definite conclusions.
Specifically, recent serology studies from California suggest a prevalence
anywhere in the range 0%-2% (at the time of study), and are therefore
inconclusive. However, this range could be narrowed down to 0.7%-1.5% if the
actual false positive rate of the antibody test was indeed near its empirical
estimate (~0.5%). In another study from New York state, Covid-19 prevalence is
confidently estimated in the range 13%-17% in mid-April of 2020, which also
suggests significant geographic variation in Covid-19 exposure across the US.
Combining all datasets yields a 5%-8% prevalence range. Our results overall
suggest that serology testing on a massive scale can give crucial information
for future policy design, even when such tests are imperfect and their
parameters unknown.

the compact object as an X-ray backlight, the time variability of the absorbing
column density in the wind can be exploited in order to shed light on the
micro-structure of the wind and obtain unbiased stellar mass loss rates for
high mass stars. We explore the impact of clumpiness on the variability of the
column density with a simplified wind model. In particular, we focus on the
standard deviation of the column density and the characteristic duration of
enhanced absorption episodes, and compare them with analytical predictions
based on the porosity length. We identified the favorable systems and orbital
phases to determine the wind micro-structure. The coherence time scale of the
column density is shown to be the self-crossing time of a clump in front of the
compact object. We provide a recipe to get accurate measurements of the size
and of the mass of the clumps, purely based on the observable time variability
of the column density. The coherence time scale grants direct access to the
size of the clumps while their mass can be deduced separately from the
amplitude of the variability. If it is due to unaccreted passing-by clumps, the
high column density variations in some HMXBs requires high mass clumps to
reproduce the observed peak-to-peak amplitude and coherence time scales. These
clump properties are hardly compatible with the ones derived from first
principles. Alternatively, other components could contribute to the variability
of the column density: larger orbital scale structures produced by a mechanism
still to be identified, or a dense environment in the immediate vicinity of the
accretor such as an accretion disk, an outflow or a spherical shell around the
magnetosphere of the accreting neutron star.

the transverse-field Ising model with disordered ferromagnetic interactions on
the quasi-two-dimensional diluted Chimera graph both by quantum Monte Carlo

The experimental approach on the quantum hardware produces results that are
less clear-cut due to the intrinsic noise and errors in the analog quantum

extend this method so that it incorporates the realistic noise effect, and then
give an experimental demonstration on a superconducting IBM Quantum device. The

the estimation error saturates due to the noise. This saturated value of
estimation error is consistent to the theory, which implies the validity of the
depolarization noise model and thereby enables us to predict the basic
requirement on the hardware components (particularly the gate error) in quantum
computers to realize the quantum speedup in the amplitude estimation task.

track of the objects and their states declarative knowledge) as well as
predicting how objects behave (procedural knowledge). Black-box models with a
monolithic hidden state often fail to apply procedural knowledge consistently
and uniformly, i.e., they lack systematicity. For example, in a video game,
correct prediction of one enemy's trajectory does not ensure correct prediction
of another's. We address this issue via an architecture that factorizes
declarative and procedural knowledge and that imposes modularity within each
form of knowledge. The architecture consists of active modules called object
files that maintain the state of a single object and invoke passive external
knowledge sources called schemata that prescribe state updates. To use a video
game as an illustration, two enemies of the same type will share schemata but
will have separate object files to encode their distinct state (e.g., health,
position). We propose to use attention to determine which object files to
update, the selection of schemata, and the propagation of information between
object files. The resulting architecture is a drop-in replacement conforming to
the same input-output interface as normal recurrent networks (e.g., LSTM, GRU)
yet achieves substantially better generalization on environments that have
multiple object tokens of the same type, including a challenging intuitive
physics benchmark.

using either (1) an interventional or (2) an observational conditional

preferable in general, we argue that the choice is application dependent.
Furthermore, we argue that the choice comes down to whether it is desirable to
be true to the model or true to the data. We use linear models to investigate
this choice. After deriving an efficient method for calculating observational
conditional expectation Shapley values for linear models, we investigate how
correlation in simulated data impacts the convergence of observational
conditional expectation Shapley values. Finally, we present two real data

hits are orders of magnitude faster than misses. To increase cache hits, we
focus on the problem of cache replacement: choosing which cache line to evict
upon inserting a new line. This is challenging because it requires planning far
ahead and currently there is no known practical solution. As a result, current
replacement policies typically resort to heuristics designed for specific
common access patterns, which fail on more diverse and complex access patterns.
In contrast, we propose an imitation learning approach to automatically learn
cache access patterns by leveraging Belady's, an oracle policy that computes
the optimal eviction decision given the future cache accesses. While directly
applying Belady's is infeasible since the future is unknown, we train a policy
conditioned only on past accesses that accurately approximates Belady's even on
diverse and complex access patterns, and call this approach Parrot. When
evaluated on 13 of the most memory-intensive SPEC applications, Parrot
increases cache miss rates by 20% over the current state of the art. In
addition, on a large-scale web search benchmark, Parrot increases cache hit
rates by 61% over a conventional LRU policy. We release a Gym environment to
facilitate research in this area, as data is plentiful, and further
advancements can have significant real-world impact.

  The LW-DNA models are identified without extra computational cost or training

astrophysics, and have received much attention as a dark matter candidate and
as a potential source of gravitational waves. One possible PBH formation
mechanism is the gravitational collapse of cosmic strings. Thus far, the
entirety of the literature on PBH production from cosmic strings has focused on
the collapse of (quasi)circular cosmic string loops, which make up only a tiny
fraction of the cosmic loop population. We demonstrate here a novel PBH
formation mechanism: the collapse of a small segment of cosmic string in the
neighbourhood of a cusp. Using the hoop conjecture, we show that collapse is
inevitable whenever a cusp appears on a macroscopically-large loop, forming a
PBH whose rest mass is smaller than the mass of the loop by a factor of the
dimensionless string tension squared, $(G\mu)^2$. Since cusps are generic
features of cosmic string loops, and do not rely on finely-tuned loop
configurations like circular collapse, this implies that cosmic strings produce
PBHs in far greater numbers than has previously been recognised. The resulting
PBHs are highly spinning and boosted to ultrarelativistic velocities; they
populate a unique region of the BH mass-spin parameter space, and are therefore
a ""smoking gun"" observational signature of cosmic strings. We derive new
constraints on $G\mu$ from the evaporation of cusp-collapse PBHs, and update
existing constraints on $G\mu$ from gravitational-wave searches.

suggests that the scales of mass and coupling parameters preferred by the

leading order photon rate comes from the three processes of the zeroth order in
the coupling constant $\alpha_s$: (i) the quark splitting ($q\rightarrow
q+\gamma $), (ii) the antiquark splitting ($\bar{q} \rightarrow \bar{q}+\gamma
$), and (iii) the quark-antiquark annihilation ($q + \bar{q}\rightarrow
\gamma$). In a wide range of moderately high temperatures, $T\gtrsim m_\pi$,
and strong magnetic fields, $|eB|\gtrsim m_\pi^2$, the direct photon production
is dominated by the two splitting processes. We show that the Landau-level
quantization of quark states plays an important role in the energy and angular
dependence of the photon emission. Among other things, it leads to a nontrivial
momentum dependence of the photon ellipticity coefficient $v_2$, which takes
negative values at small transverse momenta and positive values at large
transverse momenta. The crossover between the two regimes occurs around
$k_T\simeq \sqrt{|eB|}$. In application to heavy-ion collisions, this suggests
that a large value of $v_2$ for the direct photons could be explained in part
by the magnetic field in the quark-gluon plasma.

temperature, surface gravity and metallicity) accurately and precisely to
broad-band stellar photometry. This model must, and does, simultaneously
constrain the passband-specific dust reddening vector in the Milky Way. The
model uses a neural network to learn the (de-reddened) absolute magnitude in
one band and colors across many bands, given stellar parameters from
spectroscopic surveys and parallax constraints from Gaia. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach, we train our model on a dataset with
spectroscopic parameters from LAMOST, APOGEE and GALAH, Gaia parallaxes, and
optical and near-infrared photometry from Gaia, Pan-STARRS~1, 2MASS and WISE.
Testing the model on these datasets leads to an excellent fit and a precise -
and by construction accurate - prediction of the color-magnitude diagrams in
many bands. This flexible approach rigorously links spectroscopic and
photometric surveys, and also results in an improved,
stellar-temperature-dependent reddening vector. As such, it provides a simple
and accurate method for predicting photometry in stellar evolutionary models.
Our model will form a basis to infer stellar properties, distances and dust
extinction from photometric data, which should be of great use in 3D mapping of
the Milky Way. Our trained model may be obtained at

size is also larger around single star than binaries. However, since most discs

the Campaign 5 field is nearly 120 angular degrees away from the Kepler field,
this occurrence similarity offers evidence that the Kepler sample may provide a
good baseline for Galactic inferences. Furthermore, the Kepler stellar sample
is metal-rich compared to the K2 Campaign 5 sample, thus a finding of

limit of geometrical optics. Both phenomena can be effectively described by a
projected, two-dimensional deflection potential whose gradient causes an
instantaneous light deflection in a single, thin lens plane. We highlight the
differences in the time-delay and lensing equations that occur because plasma
lensing is caused by a potential directly proportional to the deflecting
electron number density and gravitational lensing is caused by a potential
related to the deflecting mass density by a Poisson equation. Since we treat
plasma and gravitational lensing as thin-screen effective theories, their
degeneracies are both caused by the unknown distribution of deflecting objects.
Deriving the formalism-intrinsic degeneracies for plasma lensing, we find that
they are analogous to those occurring in gravitational lensing. To break the
degeneracies, galaxies and galaxy-cluster scale strong gravitational lenses
must rely on additional assumptions or complementary observations. Physically
realistic assumptions to arrive at self-consistent lens and source
reconstructions can be provided by simulations and analytical effective
theories. In plasma lensing, a deeper understanding of the deflecting electron
density distributions is still under development, so that a model-based
comprehensive lens reconstruction is not yet possible. However, we show that
transient lenses and multi-wavelength observations help to break the arising
degeneracies. We conclude that the development of an observation-based
inference of local lens properties seems currently the best way to further
probe the morphologies of plasma electron densities. Due to the simpler
evidence-based breaking of the lensing degeneracies, we expect to obtain
tighter constraints on the local plasma electron densities than on the
gravitationally deflecting masses.

high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the emission

r-modes to large amplitudes, but concurrently the oscillations are likely
damped by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence driven by the magnetorotational

MHD simulations of relativistic accretion discs, and find that a sufficiently
strong disc distortion generates trapped inertial waves despite this damping.
In our simulations, eccentricities above ~ 0.03 in the inner disc excite
trapped waves. In addition to the competition between r-mode damping and
driving, we observe that larger amplitude eccentric structures modify and in
some cases suppress MRI turbulence. Given the variety of distortions (warps as

trapped inertial wave excitation in the face of MRI turbulence in our
simulations provides support for a discoseismic explanation for HFQPOs.

on the theory of trace dynamics. This is a Lagrangian dynamics in which the
matrix degrees of freedom are made from Grassmann numbers, and the Lagrangian
is trace of a matrix polynomial. Matrices made from even grade elements of the
Grassmann algebra are called bosonic, and those made from odd grade elements
are called fermionic: together they describe an `aikyon'. In the present
article we provide a basic definition of spin angular momentum in this matrix
dynamics, and introduce a bosonic (fermionic) configuration variable conjugate
to the spin of a boson (fermion). We then show that at energies below Planck
scale, where the matrix dynamics reduces to quantum theory, fermions have
half-integer spin (in multiples of Planck's constant), and bosons have integral
spin. We also show that this definition of spin agrees with the conventional
understanding of spin in relativistic quantum mechanics. Consequently, we
obtain an elementary proof for the spin-statistics connection. We then motivate
why an octonionic space is the natural space in which an aikyon evolves. The
group of automorphisms in this space is the exceptional Lie group $G_2$ which
has fourteen generators [could they stand for the twelve vector bosons and two
degrees of freedom of the graviton? ]. The aikyon also resembles a closed
string, and it has been suggested in the literature that 10-D string theory can
be represented as a 2-D string in the 8-D octonionic space. From the work of
Cohl Furey and others it is known that the Dixon algebra made from the four
division algebras [real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions and octonions]
can possibly describe the symmetries of the standard model. In the present
paper we outline how in our work the Dixon algebra arises naturally, and could
lead to a unification of gravity with the standard model.

mass is dictated dynamically by the equations of motion. The transition
exponent is computed and displays an explicit dependence on temperature. We
find the configuration with the lowest Euclidean action to be static and $O(3)$
symmetric; therefore, the transition takes place via thermal excitation. The
transition exponent exhibits a strong dependence on the seed mass black hole,
$M_+$, being almost directly proportional. A new nucleation condition in the
presence of black holes is derived and the nucleation temperature is compared
to the familiar flat-space result, i.e. $S_3/T$. For an electroweak-like phase
transition it is possible to enhance the nucleation rate if $M_+ \lesssim
10^{15} M_{\rm P}$. Finally, we outline the possible transition scenarios and
the consequences for the power spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves

high-energy dilute-dense collisions, the improved TMD (ITMD) factorization
formula was recently proposed. In the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework,
it represents the leading term of an expansion in inverse powers of the hard
scale. It contains the leading-twist TMD factorization formula relevant for
small gluon's transverse momentum $k_t$, but also incorporates an all-order
resummation of kinematical twists, resulting in a proper matching to
high-energy factorization at large $k_t$. In this paper, we evaluate the
accuracy of the ITMD formula quantitatively, for the case of quark dijet
production in high-energy proton-proton($p+p$) and proton-nucleus ($p+A$)
collisions at LHC energies. We do so by comparing the quark-antiquark azimuthal
angle $\Delta\phi$ distribution to that obtained with the CGC formula. For a
dijet with each quark momentum $p_t$ much larger than the target saturation
scale, $Q_s$, the ITMD formula is a good approximation to the CGC formula in a
wide range of azimuthal angle. It becomes less accurate as the jet $p_t$'s are
lowered, as expected, due to the presence of genuine higher-twists
contributions in the CGC framework, which represent multi-body scattering
effects absent in the ITMD formula. We find that, as the hard jet momenta are
lowered, the accuracy of ITMD start by deteriorating at small angles, in the
high-energy-factorization regime, while in the TMD regime near
$\Delta\phi=\pi$, very low values of $p_t$ are needed to see differences
between the CGC and the ITMD formula. In addition, the genuine twists
corrections to ITMD become visible for higher values of $p_t$ in $p+A$
collisions, compared to $p+p$ collisions, signaling that they are enhanced by
the target saturation scale.

with tangential velocity information. However, using this catalogue for
dynamical studies is difficult because most of the stars lack line-of-sight
velocity measurements. Recently, we presented a selection of $\sim 10^7$ halo
stars with accurate distances that have been selected based on their photometry
and proper motions. Using this sample, we model the tail of the velocity
distribution with a power-law distribution, a commonly used approach first
established by \cite{Leonard1990THESPEED}. For the first time ever we use
tangential velocities measured accurately for an unprecedented number of halo
stars to estimate the escape velocity. In the solar neighbourhood, we obtain a
very precise estimate of the escape velocity which is $497^{+8}_{-8}~{\rm
km/s}$. This estimate is most likely biased low, our best guess is by 10\%. As
a result, the true escape velocity most likely is closer to $550~{\rm km/s}$.
The escape velocity directly constrains the total mass of the Milky Way. To
find the best fitting halo mass and concentration parameter we adjusted the
dark (spherical NFW) halo of a realistic Milky Way potential while keeping the
circular velocity at the solar radius fixed at $v_c(R_\odot) = 232.8~{\rm
km/s}$. The resulting halo parameters are $M_{200}^{+10\%} =
1.11^{+0.08}_{-0.07} \cdot10^{12} ~{\rm M}_\odot$ and concentration parameter
$c^{+10\%} = 11.8^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$, where we use the explicit notation to
indicate that these have been corrected for the 10\% bias. The slope of the
escape velocity with galactocentric distance is as expected in the inner Galaxy
based on Milky Way models. Curiously, we find a disagreement beyond the solar
radius which is likely an effect of a change in the shape of the velocity
distribution and could be related to the presence of velocity clumps.

low latency and high bandwidth. Complex data structures in it ought to be

Traditional database technologies such as keeping a separate log, a journal, or
shadow data work on a coarse-grained level, where the whole transaction is made
visible using a final atomic update operation. These methods typically need
significant additional space overhead and induce non-trivial overhead for log
pruning, state maintenance, and resource (de-)allocation. Thus, they are not
necessarily the best choice for NVRAM, which supports fine-grained,

size of the data structure. We demonstrate and evaluate our approach on
Red-Black Trees and AVL Trees with a redo log of constant size (4 resp. 2 cache

executed eventually despite arbitrary many system crashes and recoveries in the
meantime. We update complex data structures in local and remote NVRAM providing

transformations can only become possible when given access to a specific
resource that has to be returned unaffected. It was first discovered in the
context of entanglement theory and since then applied in a number of
resource-theoretic frameworks, including quantum thermodynamics. Although in
that case the necessary (and sometimes also sufficient) conditions on the
existence of a catalyst are known, almost nothing is known about the precise
form of the catalyst state required by the transformation. In particular, it is
not clear whether it has to have some special properties or be finely tuned to
the desired transformation. In this work we describe a surprising property of
multi-copy states: we show that in resource theories governed by majorization
all resourceful states are catalysts for all allowed transformations. In
quantum thermodynamics this means that the so-called ""second laws of
thermodynamics"" do not require a fine-tuned catalyst but rather any state,
given sufficiently many copies, can serve as a useful catalyst. These analytic
results are accompanied by several numerical investigations that indicate that
neither a multi-copy form nor a very large dimension catalyst are required to
activate most allowed transformations catalytically.

proving new inequalities obeyed by all hypergraph entropy vectors that exclude
particular stabilizer states on six qubits. By further leveraging this
connection, we improve the characterization of stabilizer entropies and show
that all linear rank inequalities at five parties, except for classical
monotonicity, form facets of the stabilizer cone. Additionally, by studying
minimum cuts on hypergraphs, we prove some structural properties of hypergraph
representations of entanglement and generalize the notion of entanglement wedge
nesting in holography.

predictions based on perturbation theory due to missing higher orders. The most
widely used approach, scale variation, is largely arbitrary and it has no
probabilistic foundation, making it not suitable for robust data analysis. In
2011, Cacciari and Houdeau proposed a model based on a Bayesian approach to
provide a probabilistic definition of the theory uncertainty from missing
higher orders. In this work, we propose an improved version of the
Cacciari-Houdeau model, that overcomes some limitations. In particular, it
performs much better in case of perturbative expansions with large high-order
contributions (as it often happens in QCD). In addition, we propose an
alternative model based on the same idea of scale variation, which overcomes
some of the shortcomings of the canonical approach, on top of providing a
probabilistically-sound result. Moreover, we address the problem of the
dependence of theoretical predictions on unphysical scales (such as the
renormalization scale), and propose a solution to obtain a scale-independent
result within the probabilistic framework. We validate these methods on
expansions with known sums, and apply them to a number of physical observables
in particle physics. We also investigate some variations, improvements and
combinations of the models. We believe that these methods provide a powerful
tool to reliably estimate theory uncertainty from missing higher orders that
can be used in any physics analysis. The results of this work are easily
accessible through a public code named THunc.

multi-agent networks to external stimuli. While high-gain can increase response
speed, potential instability tends to limit the maximum possible gain, and
therefore, limits the maximum convergence rate to consensus during transitions.
Since the update law for multi-agent networks with symmetric graphs can be
considered as the gradient of its Laplacian-potential function, Nesterov-type
accelerated-gradient approaches from optimization theory, can further improve
the convergence rate of such networks. An advantage of the accelerated-gradient
approach is that it can be implemented using accelerated
delayed-self-reinforcement (A-DSR), which does not require new information from
the network nor modifications in the network connectivity. However, the
accelerated-gradient approach is not directly applicable to general directed
graphs since the update law is not the gradient of the Laplacian-potential
function. The main contribution of this work is to extend the
accelerated-gradient approach to general directed graph networks, without
requiring the graph to be strongly connected. Additionally, while both the
momentum term and outdated-feedback term in the accelerated-gradient approach
are important in general, it is shown that the momentum term alone is
sufficient to achieve balanced robustness and rapid transitions without
oscillations in the dominant mode, for networks whose graph Laplacians have
real spectrum. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance
improvement with the proposed Robust A-DSR of 40% in structural robustness and
50% in convergence rate to consensus, when compared to the case without the
A-DSR. Moreover, experimental results are presented that show a similar 37%
faster convergence with the Robust A-DSR when compared to the case without the
A-DSR.

a valuable diagnostic for the assessment of solar magnetic field models. In
this paper, seven years of IceCube data are compared to solar activity and
solar magnetic field models. A quantitative comparison of solar magnetic field
models with IceCube data on the event rate level is performed for the first
time. Additionally, a first energy-dependent analysis is presented and compared
to recent predictions. We use seven years of IceCube data for the Moon and the
Sun and compare them to simulations on data rate level. The simulations are
performed for the geometrical shadow hypothesis for the Moon and the Sun and
for a cosmic-ray propagation model governed by the solar magnetic field for the
case of the Sun. We find that a linearly decreasing relationship between Sun
shadow strength and solar activity is preferred over a constant relationship at
the 6.4sigma level. We test two commonly used models of the coronal magnetic
field, both combined with a Parker spiral, by modeling cosmic-ray propagation
in the solar magnetic field. Both models predict a weakening of the shadow in
times of high solar activity as it is also visible in the data. We find
tensions with the data on the order of $3\sigma$ for both models, assuming only
statistical uncertainties. The magnetic field model CSSS fits the data slightly
better than the PFSS model. This is generally consistent with what is found
previously by the Tibet AS-gamma Experiment, a deviation of the data from the
two models is, however, not significant at this point. Regarding the energy
dependence of the Sun shadow, we find indications that the shadowing effect
increases with energy during times of high solar activity, in agreement with
theoretical predictions.

resonant and non-resonant mode, to study the cytoplasmic membrane and surface
of intact cells. Non-resonant PTIR images apparently provide rich details of
the cell surface. However we show that non-resonant image contrast does not
arise from the infrared absorption of surface molecules and is instead
dominated by the mechanics of tip-sample contact. In contrast, spectra and
images of the cellular surface can be selectively obtained by tuning the
pulsing structure of the laser to restrict thermal wave penetration to the
surface layer. Resonant PTIR images reveal surface structures and domains that
range in size from about 20 nm to 1 um and are associated to the cytoplasmic
membrane and its proximity. Resonant PTIR spectra of the cell surface are
comparable to far-field IR spectra and provide the first selective measurement
of the IR absorption spectrum of the cellular membrane of an intact cell. In
resonant PTIR images, signal intensity, and therefore contrast, can be ascribed
to a variety of factors, including mechanical, thermodynamic and spectroscopic
properties of the cellular surface. While PTIR images are difficult to
interpret in terms of spectroscopic absorption, they are easy to collect and
provide unique contrast mechanisms without any exogenous labeling. As such they
provide a new paradigm in cellular imaging and membrane biology and can be used
to address a range of critical questions, from the nature of membrane lipid
domains to viral membrane fusion.

(SDSS) with UV flux observations from the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), we
examine the environmental dependence (through central/satellite distinction) of
the rapid quenching and rejuvenation of galaxies. H$\alpha$ emissions trace the
most massive stars, thereby indicating star-formation on timescales of $\sim
10$ Myr, while UV emission traces star-formation on timescales of $\sim 100$
Myr. These varying timescales are exploited to probe the most recent
star-formation histories of galaxies. In this work, we define a class of
transient galaxies which have UV emission typical of star-formation but
negligible H$\alpha$ emission. We find that the occurrence of these transients
has a strong stellar mass dependence in both the satellite and central
population. However, while at stellar masses greater than $\sim 10^{10}
M_\odot$ they occur with equal frequency regardless of environmental class, at
lower stellar masses they are more common in satellites only, with an excess of
about 1 percentage point across all low stellar mass galaxies. These satellite
transients also have a strong halo mass and group-centric radial dependence
suggesting they are driven by an environmental process. Finally, we select a
sample of galaxies with H$\alpha$ emission but not UV emission which could
contain short-timescale rejuvenating galaxies. These rejuvenating candidates
are few in number and do not have a strong difference in their occurrence rate
in centrals or satellites. These unique probes point to an environmental
quenching mechanism which occurs on short timescales after the satellite has
been in the group environment for a significant time - consistent with
'delayed-then-rapid' quenching.

Such biases can have detrimental consequences on different population and
minority groups as applications of KG begin to intersect and interact with
social spheres. This paper aims at identifying and mitigating such biases in
Knowledge Graph (KG) embeddings. As a first step, we explore popularity bias --
the relationship between node popularity and link prediction accuracy. In case
of node2vec graph embeddings, we find that prediction accuracy of the embedding
is negatively correlated with the degree of the node. However, in case of
knowledge-graph embeddings (KGE), we observe an opposite trend. As a second
step, we explore gender bias in KGE, and a careful examination of popular KGE
algorithms suggest that sensitive attribute like the gender of a person can be
predicted from the embedding. This implies that such biases in popular KGs is
captured by the structural properties of the embedding. As a preliminary
solution to debiasing KGs, we introduce a novel framework to filter out the
sensitive attribute information from the KG embeddings, which we call FAN
(Filtering Adversarial Network). We also suggest the applicability of FAN for
debiasing other network embeddings which could be explored in future work.

advertisement (ad) usually needs to be exposed to the same user multiple times
until the user finally contributes revenue (e.g., places an order). However,
existing advertising systems mainly focus on the immediate revenue with single

formulate the sequential advertising strategy optimization as a dynamic

framework, which significantly reduces the solution space of the original

cosmological simulation to explore the physical parameter space of 8 resolved
ISM properties in star-forming regions to constrain the areas of this
hyperspace over which most star-forming environments exist. We deconstruct our
simulated galaxies spanning a wide range of mass (M$_\star = 10^{7-11}$
M$_\odot$) and redshift ($0 \leq z \leq 3$) into kpc-sized regions, and
statistically analyze the gas/stellar surface densities, gas metallicity,
vertical stellar velocity dispersion, epicyclic frequency and dark-matter
volumetric density representative of each region in the context of their star
formation activity and galactic environment (radial galactocentric location).
By examining the star formation rate (SFR) weighted distributions of these
properties, we show that stars primarily form in two spatially distinct
environmental regimes, which are brought about by an underlying bi-component
radial SFR surface density profile in galaxies. We examine how the relative
prominence of these two regimes depends on host galaxy mass and cosmic time. We
also compare our findings with those from integral field spectroscopy
observations and achieve a good overall agreement. Further, using
dimensionality reduction, we characterise the aforementioned hyperspace to
reveal a high-degree of multicollinearity in relationships amongst ISM
properties that drive the distribution of star formation at kpc-scales. Based
on this, we show that a reduced 3D representation underpinned by a
multi-variate radius relationship is sufficient to capture most of the variance

and are a key aspect of theoretical modeling of galactic evolution in a

disks, similar to gas within galaxies, consists of multiple phases with large
contrasts of density, temperature, and other properties. To study multiphase
outflows as emergent phenomena, we run a suite of ~pc-resolution local galactic
disk simulations using the TIGRESS framework. Explicit modeling of the
interstellar medium (ISM), including star formation and self-consistent
radiative heating plus supernova feedback, regulates ISM properties and drives
the outflow. We investigate the scaling of outflow mass, momentum, energy, and
metal loading factors with galactic disk properties, including star formation
rate (SFR) surface density (\Sigma_SFR~10^{-4}-1 M_sun/kpc^2/yr), gas surface
density (~1-100 M_sun/pc^2), and total midplane pressure (or weight)
(~10^3-10^6 k_B cm^{-3} K). The main components of outflowing gas are
mass-delivering cool gas (T~10^4 K) and energy/metal-delivering hot gas (T~10^6
K). Cool mass outflow rates measured at outflow launch points (one or two scale
heights) are 1-100 times the SFR (decreasing with \Sigma_SFR), although in
massive galaxies most mass falls back due to insufficient outflow velocity. The
hot galactic outflow carries mass comparable to 10% of the SFR, together with
10-20% of the energy and 30-60% of the metal mass injected by SN feedback. The
characteristic outflow velocities of both phases scale very weakly with SFR, as
v_out \propto \Sigma_SFR^{0.1~0.2}, consistent with observations. Importantly,
our analysis demonstrates that in any physically-motivated cosmological wind
model, it is crucial to include at least two distinct thermal wind components.

we isolate key similarities and differences. In doing so, we advance the
efforts of the SMAUG (Simulating Multiscale Astrophysics to Understand

formation process. In the cosmological simulations, the CGM exhibits nearly
flat temperature distributions, and broad pressure and radial velocity
distributions. In the idealized simulations, similar distributions are found in
the inner CGM ($\lesssim 0.5 \, r_{\rm 200c}$) when strong galactic feedback
models are employed, but the outer CGM ($\gtrsim 0.5 \, r_{\rm 200c}$) has a
much less prominent cold phase, and narrower pressure and velocity
distributions even in models with strong feedback. This comparative analysis
demonstrates the dominant role feedback plays in shaping the inner CGM and the
increased importance of cosmological effects, such as nonspherical accretion
and satellite galaxies, in the outer CGM. Furthermore, our findings highlight
that while cosmological simulations are required to capture the multiphase
structure of the CGM at large radii, idealized simulations provide a robust
framework to study how galactic feedback interacts with the inner CGM and
thereby provide a reliable avenue to constrain feedback prescriptions.

well with each other in terms of stellar and interstellar mass, but differ
dramatically on circumgalactic mass (the SAM is lower than FIRE-2 by ~3 orders

rates for dwarfs compared to FIRE-2 by factors of ~10-100, and this is
compensated for with higher mass outflow rates in the SAM. We argue that the
most severe model discrepancies are caused by the lack of preventative stellar
feedback and the assumptions for halo gas cooling and recycling in the SAM. As
a first step towards resolving these model tensions, we present a simple yet
promising new preventative stellar feedback model in which the energy carried

called the rack force, plays an important role in the function of electric
power steering (EPS) systems. Estimates of rack force can be used by EPS to
attenuate road feedback and reduce driver effort. Further, estimates of the
components of rack force (arising, for example, due to steering angle and road
profile) can be used to separately compensate for each component and thereby
enhance steering feel. In this paper, we present three vehicle and tire
model-based rack force estimators that utilize sensed steering angle and road
profile to estimate total rack force and individual components of rack force.
We test and compare the real-time performance of the estimators by performing
driving experiments with non-aggressive and aggressive steering maneuvers on
roads with low and high frequency profile variations. The results indicate that
for aggressive maneuvers the estimators using non-linear tire models produce
more accurate rack force estimates. Moreover, only the estimator that
incorporates a semi-empirical Rigid Ring tire model is able to capture rack
force variation for driving on a road with high frequency profile variation.
Finally, we present results from a simulation study to validate the

the wake expansion response is found to display hysteresis as a result of flow
inertia. The timescales of the wake response to different pitch rates are
quantified. Next, changes in wind direction with different timescales are
explored. Under short timescales, the wake deflection is in the opposite
direction of that observed under quasi-steady conditions. Finally, yaw changes
are implemented at different rates, and the maximum inverse wake deflection and
timescale are quantified, showing a clear dependence on yaw rate. To gain
further physical understanding of the mechanism behind the inverse wake
deflection, the streamwise vorticity in different parts of the wake is
quantified. The results of this study provide guidance for the design of
advanced wake flow control algorithms. The lag in wake response observed for
both blade pitch and yaw changes shows that proposed dynamic control strategies
must implement turbine operational changes with a timescale on the order of the
rotor timescale or slower.

been proposed for analyzing and verifying neural network properties, but their
usage has been fairly limited owing to their poor scalability with larger
networks. In this work, we propose a technique for combining gradient-based
methods with symbolic techniques to scale such analyses and demonstrate its
application for model explanation. In particular, we apply this technique to
identify minimal regions in an input that are most relevant for a neural
network's prediction. Our approach uses gradient information (based on
Integrated Gradients) to focus on a subset of neurons in the first layer, which
allows our technique to scale to large networks. The corresponding SMT
constraints encode the minimal input mask discovery problem such that after
masking the input, the activations of the selected neurons are still above a
threshold. After solving for the minimal masks, our approach scores the mask
regions to generate a relative ordering of the features within the mask. This
produces a saliency map which explains ""where a model is looking"" when making a
prediction. We evaluate our technique on three datasets - MNIST, ImageNet, and
Beer Reviews, and demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that the
regions generated by our approach are sparser and achieve higher saliency
scores compared to the gradient-based methods alone. Code and examples are at -

  Cognitive Science Society",,,,"cs.CL cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  How do learners acquire languages from the limited data available to them?
This process must involve some inductive biases - factors that affect how a
learner generalizes - but it is unclear which inductive biases can explain
observed patterns in language acquisition. To facilitate computational modeling
aimed at addressing this question, we introduce a framework for giving
particular linguistic inductive biases to a neural network model; such a model
can then be used to empirically explore the effects of those inductive biases.
This framework disentangles universal inductive biases, which are encoded in
the initial values of a neural network's parameters, from non-universal
factors, which the neural network must learn from data in a given language. The
initial state that encodes the inductive biases is found with meta-learning, a
technique through which a model discovers how to acquire new languages more
easily via exposure to many possible languages. By controlling the properties
of the languages that are used during meta-learning, we can control the
inductive biases that meta-learning imparts. We demonstrate this framework with
a case study based on syllable structure. First, we specify the inductive
biases that we intend to give our model, and then we translate those inductive
biases into a space of languages from which a model can meta-learn. Finally,
using existing analysis techniques, we verify that our approach has imparted
the linguistic inductive biases that it was intended to impart.

different characteristics (features) in a social network that can be used for

The aggregated features, in a social network, are some aggregation functions of
the attributes of the nodes. Topological features describe the topology or
structure of a social network, and its underlying graph. We evaluated the
effectiveness of these features by measuring the performance of different
supervised machine learning methods. Specifically, we selected five well-known
supervised methods including J48 decision tree, multi-layer perceptron (MLP),
support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression and Naive Bayes (NB). We
measured the performance of these five methods with different sets of features
of the DBLP Dataset. Our results indicate that the combination of aggregated

purposes, we used accuracy, area under the ROC curve (AUC) and F-Measure.
  Our selected features can be used for the analysis of almost any social
network. This is because these features provide the important characteristics
of the underlying graph of the social networks. The significance of our work is
that the selected features can be very effective in the analysis of big social
networks. In such networks we usually deal with big data sets, with millions or
billions of instances. Using fewer, but more effective, features can help us

due to the complex nature of the galaxy evolution and thus often requires too
many parameters in order to fit the observational data. In this paper, we
present a new halo model for the anisotropies of the CIB using only four
parameters. Our model connects the mass accretion on the dark matter halos to
the star formation rate. Using this model, we find that the halo mass with the
maximum efficiency for converting the accreted baryons into stars is
$\log_{10}M_\mathrm{max} = {12.94}^{+0.02}_{-0.02} \: M_\odot$, consistent with
other studies. Accounting for the mass loss through stellar evolution, we find,
for an intermediate age galaxy, that the star formation efficiency defined as
$M_\star(z)/M_b(z)$ is equal to 0.19 and 0.21 at redshift 0.1 and 2
respectively, in good agreement with the values obtained by previous studies.
It is the first time that a CIB model is used to fit Planck and Herschel CIB
power spectra simultaneously. However we find that the large angular scale
Planck and Herschel data are not fully compatible with the small scale Herschel
data (for $\ell>3000$). The CIB is expected to be correlated with the tSZ
signal of the galaxy clusters. Using this halo model for the CIB, and a halo
model for the tSZ with a single parameter, we also provide a consistent
framework to calculate this cross-correlation, which requires no extra
parameter. The CIB$\times$tSZ correlation is found to be higher when inferred
with a combination of two widely spaced frequency channels (e.g. 143x857 GHz).
The CIB, tSZ, and CIB$\times$tSZ act as foregrounds while measuring the kSZ
power spectrum from the CMB power spectrum and need to be removed. Due to its
simplistic nature and low number of parameters, the halo model formalism
presented here is quite useful for such an analysis to measure the kSZ power
spectrum accurately.

data which circumvents the problem of acquiring a training dataset that limits
the use of NNs.
  We demonstrate through a series of experiments that this architecture is
possible and practical. It generates diverse, sensible program inputs, while
exploring the space of program behaviours. It also creates a meaningful
ordering over program behaviours and is able to find crashing executions. This
is all done without any prior knowledge of the program.

below that of the sky. The overall properties of these low-surface-brightness
galaxies (LSBGs) remain understudied, and in particular we know very little
about their massive black hole population. This gap must be closed to determine
the frequency of massive black holes at z=0 as well as to understand their role
in regulating galaxy evolution. Here we investigate the incidence and intensity
of nuclear, accretion-powered X-ray emission in a sample of 32 nearby LSBGs
with the Chandra X-ray Observatory. A nuclear X-ray source is detected in 4
galaxies (12.5%). Based on an X-ray binary contamination assessment technique
developed for normal galaxies, we conclude that the detected X-ray nuclei
indicate low-level accretion from massive black holes. The active fraction is
consistent with that expected from the stellar mass distribution of the LSBGs,
but not their total baryonic mass, when using a scaling relation from an
unbiased X-ray survey of normal galaxies. This suggests that their black holes
co-evolved with their stellar population. In addition, the apparent agreement
nearly doubles the number of galaxies available within ~100 Mpc for which a
measurement of nuclear activity can efficiently constrain the frequency of
black holes as a function of stellar mass. We conclude by discussing the
feasibility of measuring this occupation fraction to a few percent precision
below 1e10 solar masses with high-resolution, wide-field X-ray missions

loss of lateral resolution at the focal plane. Placing the MLA near the pupil

Here, we demonstrate improved resolution across a large volume with Fourier
DiffuserScope, which uses a diffuser in the pupil plane to encode 3D
information, then computationally reconstructs the volume by solving a
sparsity-constrained inverse problem. Our diffuser consists of randomly placed
microlenses with varying focal lengths; the random positions provide a larger

axial depth range. To predict system performance based on diffuser parameters,
we for the first time establish a theoretical framework and design guidelines,
which are verified by numerical simulations, then build an experimental system
that achieves $< 3$ um lateral and $4$ um axial resolution over a $1000 \times

an approach that relies on architecture support to eliminate SDBCB without
requiring much programming effort while incurring low performance overheads.
The key idea is that when a secret-dependent branch is encountered, the SeMPE
microarchitecture fetches, executes, and commits both paths of the branch,
preventing the adversary from inferring secret values from the branching
behavior of the program. To enable that, SeMPE relies on an architecture that
is capable of safely executing both branch paths sequentially. Through
microbenchmarks and an evaluation of a real-world library, we show that SeMPE
incurs near ideal execution time overheads, which is the sum of the execution
time of all branch paths of secret-dependent branches. SeMPE outperforms code
generated by FaCT, a constant-time expression language, by up to a factor of
18x.

probabilistic framework to model and calibrate a human's trust and workload

This calibration is achieved by varying the automation's transparency---the

missing relational link between entities. Knowledge graph embedding methods
perform this task by representing entities and relations as embedding vectors

Previous work has usually treated each embedding as a whole and has modeled the
interactions between these whole embeddings, potentially making the model
excessively expensive or requiring specially designed interaction mechanisms.
In this work, we propose the multi-partition embedding interaction (MEI) model
with block term format to systematically address this problem. MEI divides each
embedding into a multi-partition vector to efficiently restrict the
interactions. Each local interaction is modeled with the Tucker tensor format
and the full interaction is modeled with the block term tensor format, enabling
MEI to control the trade-off between expressiveness and computational cost,
learn the interaction mechanisms from data automatically, and achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the link prediction task. In addition, we
theoretically study the parameter efficiency problem and derive a simple
empirically verified criterion for optimal parameter trade-off. We also apply
the framework of MEI to provide a new generalized explanation for several
specially designed interaction mechanisms in previous models. The source code

statistical measures beyond the average delay. In this paper, we study the
real-time prediction of the end-to-end delay distribution in systems with
composite services such as service function chains. In order to have a general
framework, we use queueing theory to model service systems, while also adopting
a statistical learning approach to avoid the limitations of queueing-theoretic

used to make the analysis mathematically tractable. Specifically, we use deep
mixture density networks (MDN) to predict the end-to-end distribution of the

general to be applied in different contexts and applications. Our evaluations
show a good match between the learned distributions and the simulations, which
suggest that the proposed method is a good candidate for providing
probabilistic bounds on the end-to-end delay of more complex systems where
simulations or theoretical methods are not applicable.

adversarial examples that through small perturbations to inputs cause incorrect
predictions. Further, trust is undermined when models give miscalibrated
predictions, i.e., the predicted probability is not a good indicator of how
much we should trust our model. In this paper, we study the connection between
adversarial robustness and calibration and find that the inputs for which the
model is sensitive to small perturbations (are easily attacked) are more likely
to have poorly calibrated predictions. Based on this insight, we examine if
calibration can be improved by addressing those adversarially unrobust inputs.
To this end, we propose Adversarial Robustness based Adaptive Label Smoothing
(AR-AdaLS) that integrates the correlations of adversarial robustness and
calibration into training by adaptively softening labels for an example based
on how easily it can be attacked by an adversary. We find that our method,
taking the adversarial robustness of the in-distribution data into
consideration, leads to better calibration over the model even under
distributional shifts. In addition, AR-AdaLS can also be applied to an ensemble
model to further improve model calibration.

algorithm utilizes a set of spike-and-slab priors for the parameters in the

adaptive empirical method. That is, one will alternatively sample from the
posterior using preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin Dynamics (PSGLD),
and optimize the latent variables via stochastic approximation. The sparsity of
the network is achieved while optimizing the hyperparameters with adaptive
searching and penalizing. A popular SG-MCMC approach is Stochastic gradient
Langevin dynamics (SGLD). However, considering the complex geometry in the
model parameter space in non-convex learning, updating parameters using a
universal step size in each component as in SGLD may cause slow mixing. To
address this issue, we apply a computationally manageable preconditioner in the
updating rule, which provides a step-size parameter to adapt to local geometric
properties. Moreover, by smoothly optimizing the hyperparameter in the
preconditioning matrix, our proposed algorithm ensures a decreasing bias, which
is introduced by ignoring the correction term in preconditioned SGLD. According
to the existing theoretical framework, we show that the proposed algorithm can
asymptotically converge to the correct distribution with a controllable bias
under mild conditions. Numerical tests are performed on both synthetic
regression problems and learning the solutions of elliptic PDE, which
demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of present work.

sequence generation, but are suffering from the issue of high inference
latency. Non-autoregressive (NAR) models have been recently proposed to reduce
the latency by generating all output tokens in parallel but could only achieve
inferior accuracy compared to their autoregressive counterparts, primarily due
to a difficulty in dealing with the multi-modality in sequence generation. This
paper proposes a new approach that jointly optimizes both AR and NAR models in
a unified Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. In the E-step, an AR model
learns to approximate the regularized posterior of the NAR model. In the
M-step, the NAR model is updated on the new posterior and selects the training
examples for the next AR model. This iterative process can effectively guide
the system to remove the multi-modality in the output sequences. To our
knowledge, this is the first EM approach to NAR sequence generation. We
evaluate our method on the task of machine translation. Experimental results on
benchmark data sets show that the proposed approach achieves competitive, if
not better, performance with existing NAR models and significantly reduces the
inference latency.

have been examined over a wide frequency range above and below the structural
and magnetic transition at $T_{\rm N}\simeq 138$ K. Above $T_{\rm N}$ the real
part of the optical conductivity and the two infrared-active lattice modes are
almost completely isotropic; the lattice modes show a weak polarization
dependence just above $T_{\rm N}$. For $T<T_{\rm N}$, the optical conductivity
due to the free-carrier response is anisotropic, being larger along the $a$
axis than the $b$ axis below $\simeq 30$ meV; above this energy the optical
conductivity is dominated by the interband contributions, which appear to be
isotropic. The splitting of the low-energy infrared-active mode below $T_{\rm
N}$ is clearly observed, and the polarization modulation of the new modes may
be used to estimate that the crystal is $\simeq 70$% detwinned. The
high-frequency mode, with a threefold increase in strength of the lower branch
below $T_{\rm N}$ and nearly silent upper branch, remains enigmatic.

subjectivity -- with an emphasis on the accuracy (or utility) of the released

pertaining to the reviews is already available in public, and we use this
information to post-process the data released by any privacy mechanism in a
manner that improves the accuracy (utility) of the data while retaining the
privacy guarantees. Our framework works with any privacy-preserving mechanism
that operates via releasing perturbed data. We present several positive and
negative theoretical results, including a polynomial-time algorithm for
improving on the privacy-utility tradeoff.

accessible by playing it. While there have been impressive demonstrations in
such settings, prior techniques have not offered safety guarantees, that is,
guarantees on the game-theoretic exploitability of the computed strategies. In
this paper we introduce an approach that shows that it is possible to provide
exploitability guarantees in such settings without ever exploring the entire
game. We introduce a notion of a certificate of an extensive-form approximate
Nash equilibrium. For verifying a certificate, we give an algorithm that runs
in time linear in the size of the certificate rather than the size of the whole
game. In zero-sum games, we further show that an optimal certificate -- given
the exploration so far -- can be computed with any standard game-solving
algorithm (e.g., using a linear program or counterfactual regret minimization).
However, unlike in the cases of normal form or perfect information, we show
that certain families of extensive-form games do not have small approximate
certificates, even after making extremely nice assumptions on the structure of
the game. Despite this difficulty, we find experimentally that very small
certificates, even exact ones, often exist in large and even in infinite games.
Overall, our approach enables one to try one's favorite exploration strategies
while offering exploitability guarantees, thereby decoupling the exploration
strategy from the equilibrium-finding process.

techniques. Our proposed model, entitled Network Centrality Approximation using
Graph Embedding (NCA-GE), uses the adjacency matrix of a graph and a set of
features for each node (here, we use only the degree) as input and computes the
approximate desired centrality rank for every node. NCA-GE has a time
complexity of $O(|E|)$, $E$ being the set of edges of a graph, making it
suitable for large networks. NCA-GE also trains pretty fast, requiring only a
set of a thousand small synthetic scale-free graphs (ranging from 100 to 1000
nodes each), and it works well for different node centralities, network sizes,
and topologies. Finally, we compare our approach to the state-of-the-art method
that approximates centrality ranks using the degree and eigenvector
centralities as input, where we show that the NCA-GE outperforms the former in
a variety of scenarios.

order of magnitude while having a smaller memory footprint.
  In this paper, we present COAX, a learned index for multidimensional data
that, instead of learning the distribution of keys, learns the correlations
between attributes of the dataset. Our approach is driven by the observation
that in many datasets, values of two (or multiple) attributes are correlated.
COAX exploits these correlations to reduce the dimensionality of the datasets.
  More precisely, we learn how to infer one (or multiple) attribute $C_d$ from
the remaining attributes and hence no longer need to index attribute $C_d$.
This reduces the dimensionality and hence makes the index smaller and more
efficient.
  We theoretically investigate the effectiveness of the proposed technique
based on the predictability of the FD attributes. We further show
experimentally that by predicting correlated attributes in the data, we can
improve the query execution time and reduce the memory overhead of the index.
In our experiments, we reduce the execution time by 25% while reducing the
memory footprint of the index by four orders of magnitude.

prediction accuracy and do not guarantee calibration neither in theory nor in
practice. In this work, we formally introduce the problem of calibration under
domain shift, and propose an importance sampling based approach to address it.
We evaluate and discuss the efficacy of our method on both real-world datasets
and synthetic datasets.

oracle queries are needed to recover both of the models simultaneously? This

constraints are closed under the minority polymorphism can be solved in
polynomial time. This result, along with the results in [Mastrolilli SODA'19],
completes the identification of the precise borderline of tractability for the

motivated by the pursuit of understanding the issue of bit complexity of

In particular, this form of parallelism assumes a pipeline of devices, which is
fed a stream of samples and yields high throughput for training and inference
of DNNs. However, for such settings (large models and multiple heterogeneous

density estimation or approximation, which combines the canonical variational
autoencoder (VAE) with our recently developed flow-based generative model,
called KRnet. VAE is used as a dimension reduction technique to capture the
latent space, and KRnet is used to model the distribution of the latent
variable. Using a linear model between the data and the latent variable, we
show that VAE-KRnet can be more effective and robust than the canonical VAE.
VAE-KRnet can be used as a density model to approximate either data
distribution or an arbitrary probability density function (PDF) known up to a
constant. VAE-KRnet is flexible in terms of dimensionality. When the number of
dimensions is relatively small, KRnet can effectively approximate the
distribution in terms of the original random variable. For high-dimensional
cases, we may use VAE-KRnet to incorporate dimension reduction. One important
application of VAE-KRnet is the variational Bayes for the approximation of the
posterior distribution. The variational Bayes approaches are usually based on
the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the model and
the posterior. For high-dimensional distributions, it is very challenging to
construct an accurate density model due to the curse of dimensionality, where
extra assumptions are often introduced for efficiency. For instance, the
classical mean-field approach assumes mutual independence between dimensions,
which often yields an underestimated variance due to oversimplification. To
alleviate this issue, we include into the loss the maximization of the mutual
information between the latent random variable and the original random
variable, which helps keep more information from the region of low density such
that the estimation of variance is improved.

pressure dependent vibron frequency and direct band gap, we find that the
experimental data is consistent with the C2/c-24 phase up to 425 GPa, and
suggest that this consistency extends beyond that pressure. Specifically, we
find that qualitative changes in the band structure of the C2/c-24 phase lead
to a discontinuous drop of the direct band gap, which can explain the observed
drop without a structural transition. This alternative scenario naturally
explains the absence of hysteresis in the measurements.

the last player to move wins. We improve the upper bound on the number of moves

is an improvement by a logarithm over previous work. The new upper bound is $3n
- 3Z(n) - IZ(n) + 1$, and the existing lower bound is sharp at $n - Z(n)$
moves, where $Z(n)$ is the number of terms in the Zeckendorf decomposition of
$n$ and $IZ(n)$ is the sum of indices in the same Zeckendorf decomposition of
$n$. We also studied four deterministic variants of the game, where there was a
fixed order on which available move one takes: Combine Largest, Split Largest,
Combine Smallest and Split Smallest. We prove that Combine Largest and Split
Largest realize the lower bound. Split Smallest has the largest number of moves

method. This step often takes a vast amount of computational time to complete,
and therefore presents a bottleneck in simulation work. Solving these linear
systems efficiently requires the use of massively parallel hardware with high
computational throughput, as well as the development of algorithms which
respect the memory hierarchy of these hardware architectures to achieve high
memory bandwidth.
  In this paper, we present an algorithm to accelerate Jacobi iteration for
solving structured problems on graphics processing units (GPUs) using a
hierarchical approach in which multiple iterations are performed within on-chip
shared memory every cycle. A domain decomposition style procedure is adopted in
which the problem domain is partitioned into subdomains whose data is copied to
the shared memory of each GPU block. Jacobi iterations are performed internally
within each block's shared memory, avoiding the need to perform expensive
global memory accesses every step. We test our algorithm on the linear systems
arising from discretization of Poisson's equation in 1D and 2D, and observe
speedup in convergence using our shared memory approach compared to a
traditional Jacobi implementation which only uses global memory on the GPU. We
observe a x8 speedup in convergence in the 1D problem and a nearly x6 speedup
in the 2D case from the use of shared memory compared to a conventional GPU
approach.

has recently attracted enormous attention due to potential advancements in

the applications of high- Q factor resonances in dielectric resonances in the

explore the interplay of electric and magnetic dipoles in arrays of dielectric

experimental realization of high-Q factor resonances in the visible through the
collective diffractive coupling of electric and magnetic dipoles. Providing
direct physical insights, we also show that coupling the Rayleigh anomaly of
the array with the electric and magnetic dipoles of the individual
nanoresonators can result in the formation of different types of BICs. We
utilize the resonances in the visible regime to achieve lasing action at room
temperature with high spatial directionality and low threshold. Finally, we
experimentally demonstrate multi-mode, directional lasing and study the

changing size of dynamic networks, RNNE adds virtual node, which is not
connected to any other nodes, to the networks and replaces it when new node
arrives, so that the network size can be unified at different time. On the one
hand, RNNE pays attention to the direct links between nodes and the similarity
between the neighborhood structures of two nodes, trying to preserve the local

FRB121102 (Rajwade, et al., 2020, Cruces, et al., 2021) display periodic
windowed behavior (PWB) in the times of FRB detections. In PWB, events only
occur within a periodic window spanning some fraction of the period, but no
events may occur during many of the periods. During UT 2020 April 28, two peaks
of a soft gamma burst (Li, et al., 2021) were identified with two FRB peaks
(CHIME/FRB Collaboration, et al., 2020b) from soft gamma repeater (SGR)
1935+2154. As SGRs are a type of magnetar, these observations establish a link
between at least some FRBs and magnetars. The analysis herein, which selects
the period giving the minimum window fraction, shows PWB in this source's soft
gamma-ray emission. For 161 bursts from 2014 through 2020 from IPN
(Interplanetary Network) instruments, a clearly resolved minimum in window
fraction vs. period occurs at a 231 +/- 9 day period, and 55 \% window
fraction. The data cover only 6 bursting episodes, however, the periodicity
result appears relatively robust: First, the IPN has excellent time coverage
and is unlikely to miss bursts outside of these windows. Second, for various
data subsets (with significantly less bursts), either the best or second best
measured period was consistent with 231 days, even in the sub-sample with the
richest bursting episode removed. In addition, simulations show that even small
numbers of uniform random bursts do not show PWB, and that the results are not
due to limited sampling. The apparent PWB could have alternative explanations;
a firm conclusion of PWB would be evident, however, after the observation of
more consistent episodes. If the periodicity of this SGR's bursts can be
verified, and if similar behavior were observed in other repeating FRB sources,
it might suggest a linkage between FRB and SGR burst mechanisms or emission
conditions.

source model with planning data from 108 patients previously treated with VMAT
for prostate cancer. For the transfer learning, we selected patient cases
planned with three different styles from the same institution and one style
from a different institution to adapt the source model to four target models.
We compared the dose distributions predicted by the source model and the target
models with the clinical dose predictions and quantified the improvement in the
prediction quality for the target models over the source model using the Dice
similarity coefficients (DSC) of 10% to 100% isodose volumes and the
dose-volume-histogram (DVH) parameters of the planning target volume and the
organs-at-risk. The source model accurately predicts dose distributions for
plans generated in the same source style but performs sub-optimally for the
three internal and one external target styles, with the mean DSC ranging
between 0.81-0.94 and 0.82-0.91 for the internal and the external styles,
respectively. With transfer learning, the target model predictions improved the
mean DSC to 0.88-0.95 and 0.92-0.96 for the internal and the external styles,

the DVH parameter predictions to within 1.6%. We demonstrated model
generalizability for DL-based dose prediction and the feasibility of using

constructing high-dimensional interatomic potentials with ab initio accuracy.
Although machine learned interatomic potentials are generally orders of

descriptors. To bridge this efficiency gap, we propose an embedded atom neural
network approach with simple piecewise switching function based descriptors,
resulting in a favorable linear scaling with the number of neighbor atoms.
Numerical examples validate that this piecewise machine learning model can be
over an order of magnitude faster than various popular machine learned
potentials with comparable accuracy for both metallic and covalent materials,
approaching the speed of the fastest embedded atom method (i.e. several

a provable Reynolds number dependent bound on the amplitude of perturbations a
flow can sustain while maintaining the laminar state. Our analysis relies on an
input--output approach that partitions the dynamics into a feedback
interconnection of the linear and nonlinear dynamics (i.e., a Lur\'e system
that represents the nonlinearity as static feedback). We then construct
quadratic constraints of the nonlinear term that is restricted by system
physics to be energy-conserving (lossless) and to have bounded input--output
energy. Computing the region of attraction of the laminar state (set of safe
perturbations) and permissible perturbation amplitude are then reformulated as
Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMI), which provides a more computationally
efficient solution than prevailing nonlinear approaches based on the sum of
squares programming. The proposed framework can also be used for energy method
computations and linear stability analysis. We apply our approach to low
dimensional nonlinear shear flow models for a range of Reynolds numbers. The
results from our analytically derived bounds are consistent with the bounds

increasing the pH of the electrolyte results in an increase/decrease of the

understanding the life cycle of the interstellar medium (ISM). However,
accurate measurements of HI temperature and density are limited by the
availability of background continuum sources for measuring HI absorption. Here
we test the use of deep learning for extracting HI properties over large areas
without optical depth information. We train a 1D convolutional neural network
using synthetic observations of 3D numerical simulations of the ISM to predict
the fraction of cold neutral medium (f_CNM) and the correction to the
optically-thin HI column density for optical depth (R_HI) from $21\rm\,cm$
emission alone. We restrict our analysis to high Galactic latitudes ($|b|>30
deg), where the complexity of spectral line profiles is minimized. We verify
that the network accurately predicts f_CNM and R_HI by comparing the results
with direct constraints from 21 cm absorption. By applying the network to the
GALFA-HI survey, we generate large-area maps of f_CNM and R_HI. Although the
overall contribution to the total HI column of cold neutral medium (CNM)-rich
structures is small (~5%), we find that these structures are ubiquitous. Our
results are consistent with the picture that small-scale structures observed in
21 cm emission aligned with the magnetic field are dominated by CNM. Finally,
we demonstrate that the observed correlation between HI column density and dust
reddening (E(B-V)) declines with increasing R_HI, indicating that future
efforts to quantify foreground Galactic E(B-V) using HI, even at high
latitudes, should increase fidelity by accounting for HI phase structure.

mitigates the local minima issue in seismic full waveform inversion (FWI) via a
combination of two convexification techniques. The first technique (Lift)
extends the set of variables in the optimization problem to products of those
variables, arranged as a moment matrix. This algebraic idea is a celebrated way
to replace a hard polynomial optimization problem by a semidefinite programming
approximation. Concretely, both the model and the wavefield are lifted from
vectors to rank-2 matrices. The second technique (Relax) invites to consider
the wave equation, not as a hard constraint, but as a soft constraint to be
satisfied only approximately - a technique known as wavefield reconstruction
inversion (WRI). WRI weakens wave-equation constraints by introducing
wave-equation misfits as a weighted penalty term in the objective function. The
relaxed penalty formulation enables balancing the data and wave-equation
misfits by tuning a penalty parameter. Together, Lift and Relax help
reformulate the inverse problem as a set of constraints on a rank-2 moment
matrix in a higher dimensional space. Such a lifting strategy permits a good
data and wave-equation fit throughout the inversion process, while leaving the
numerical rank of the rank-2 moment matrix to be minimized down to one.
Numerical examples indicate that compared to FWI and WRI, LRWI can conduct
successful inversions using an initial model that would be considered too poor,
and data with a starting frequency that would be considered too high, for
either method in isolation. Specifically, LRWI increases the acceptable
starting frequency from 1.0 Hz and 0.5 Hz to 2.0 Hz and 2.5 for the Marmousi
model and the Overthrust model, respectively, in the cases of a linear gradient

picked up through clustering to represent all the load models of the load bus

buses form a new set and the RLMs of the system are picked up through spatial
clustering. In this way, the large sets of load models are represented by a
small number of RLMs, through which the storage space of the load models is
significantly reduced. The validation results in IEEE 39 bus system have shown
that the simulation accuracy can still be maintained after replacing the load

structural information of the underlying graph. In this field, many popular
approaches are influenced by the skip-gram model from natural language
processing. Most of them use a contrastive objective to train an encoder which
forces the embeddings of similar pairs to be close and embeddings of negative
samples to be far. A key of success to such contrastive learning methods is how
to draw positive and negative samples. While negative samples that are
generated by straightforward random sampling are often satisfying, methods for
drawing positive examples remains a hot topic.
  In this paper, we propose SCE for unsupervised network embedding only using
negative samples for training. Our method is based on a new contrastive

which uses graph convolutional operators as low-pass filters for smoothing node

  of 3D CAD model from partial point cloud","39 pages",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  A laser scanner can easily acquire the geometric data of physical
environments in the form of a point cloud. Recognizing objects from a point
cloud is often required for industrial 3D reconstruction, which should include
not only geometry information but also semantic information. However,
recognition process is often a bottleneck in 3D reconstruction because it
requires expertise on domain knowledge and intensive labor. To address this
problem, various methods have been developed to recognize objects by retrieving
the corresponding model in the database from an input geometry query. In recent
years, the technique of converting geometric data into an image and applying
view-based 3D shape retrieval has demonstrated high accuracy. Depth image which
encodes depth value as intensity of pixel is frequently used for view-based 3D
shape retrieval. However, geometric data collected from objects is often
incomplete due to the occlusions and the limit of line of sight. Image
generated by occluded point clouds lowers the performance of view-based 3D
object retrieval due to loss of information. In this paper, we propose a method
of viewpoint and image resolution estimation method for view-based 3D shape
retrieval from point cloud query. Automatic selection of viewpoint and image
resolution by calculating the data acquisition rate and density from the
sampled viewpoints and image resolutions are proposed. The retrieval
performance from the images generated by the proposed method is experimented
and compared for various dataset. Additionally, view-based 3D shape retrieval
performance with deep convolutional neural network has been experimented with
the proposed method.

  Observations with an Application to Stock Market Data",,,,,"stat.ME math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Estimation of the covariance matrix of asset returns is crucial to portfolio
construction. As suggested by economic theories, the correlation structure
among assets differs between emerging markets and developed countries. It is
therefore imperative to make rigorous statistical inference on correlation
matrix equality between the two groups of countries. However, if the
traditional vector-valued approach is undertaken, such inference is either
infeasible due to limited number of countries comparing to the relatively
abundant assets, or invalid due to the violations of temporal independence
assumption. This highlights the necessity of treating the observations as
matrix-valued rather than vector-valued. With matrix-valued observations, our
problem of interest can be formulated as statistical inference on covariance
structures under sub-Gaussian distributions, i.e., testing non-correlation and
correlation equality, as well as the corresponding support estimations. We
develop procedures that are asymptotically optimal under some regularity
conditions. Simulation results demonstrate the computational and statistical
advantages of our procedures over certain existing state-of-the-art methods for
both normal and non-normal distributions. Application of our procedures to
stock market data reveals interesting patterns and validates several economic
propositions via rigorous statistical testing.

two main challenges in above scenario: i) In single camera view, it is
difficult to recognize the same vehicle from the past image frames due to the
fisheye distortion, occlusion, truncation, etc. ii) In multi-camera view, the
appearance of the same vehicle varies greatly from different camera's
viewpoints. Thus, we present an integral vehicle Re-ID solution to address
these problems. Specifically, we propose a novel quality evaluation mechanism

on possible changes in electricity consumption trends. The overall theme of
these reports was that ``electricity use has decreased during the pandemic, but
the power grid is still reliable''---mostly due to reduced economic activity.
In this paper we analyze electricity data upto end of May 2020, examining both
electricity demand and variables that can indicate stress on the power grid,
such as peak demand and demand ramp-rate. We limit this study to three states
in the USA: New York, California, and Florida. The results indicate that the
effect of the pandemic on electricity demand is not a simple reduction from
comparable time frames, and there are noticeable differences among regions. The
variables that can indicate stress on the grid also conveyed mixed messages:
some indicate an increase in stress, some indicate a decrease, and some do not
indicate any clear difference. A positive message is that some of the changes
that were observed around the time stay-at-home orders were issued appeared to
revert back by May 2020. A key challenge in ascribing any observed change to
the pandemic is correcting for weather. We provide a weather-correction method,
apply it to a small city-wide area, and discuss the implications of the
estimated changes in demand. The weather correction exercise underscored that
weather-correction is as challenging as it is important.

analyze the performance of a two-user downlink NOMA system over generalized

effective rate (ER). In particular, we derive an analytical expression for an
upper bound on the DVP and we derive the exact sum ER of the downlink NOMA

ratio (SNR) approximations to the sum ER, as well as a fundamental upper bound
on the sum ER which represents the ergodic sum-rate for the downlink NOMA
system. We also analyze the sum ER of a corresponding time-division-multiplexed

consistently outperforms OMA over the practical SNR range, the relative gain
becomes smaller in more severe fading conditions, and is also smaller in the

though communicators thought they were sending important information,
recipients viewed most of the organizational bulk emails as not relevant to

to predict the risk of infection and mortality as a function of demographics,
symptoms, comorbidities, and lab values. Third, we develop a novel
epidemiological model to project the pandemic's spread and inform social
distancing policies. Fourth, we propose an optimization model to re-allocate

introducing balanced gain and loss, it has been realized in photonic, acoustic,

elusive. The major challenge is to experimentally generate the negative Gilbert
damping, which was thought to be highly unlikely but is demanded by the PT
symmetry. In this work, we study the magneto-optical interaction of
circularly-polarized lasers with a submicron magnet placed in an optical
cavity. We show that the off-resonant coupling between the driving laser and
cavity photon in the far-blue detuning can induce the magnetic gain (or
negative damping) exactly of the Gilbert type. A hyperbolic-tangent function
ansatz is found to well describe the time-resolved spin switching as the
intrinsic magnetization dissipation is overcome. When the optically pumped
magnet interacts with a purely lossy one, we observe a phase transition from
the imbalanced to passive PT symmetries by varying the detuning coeffcient. Our
findings provide a feasible way to manipulate the sign of the magnetic damping
parameter and to realize the EP in cavity optomagnonics.

pair of vertices of $S$. The \textsc{Minimum Geodetic Set (MGS)} problem is to
find a geodetic set with minimum cardinality of a given graph. The problem is
known to remain NP-hard on bipartite graphs, chordal graphs, planar graphs and
subcubic graphs. We first study \textsc{MGS} on restricted classes of planar
graphs: we design a linear-time algorithm for \textsc{MGS} on solid grids,
improving on a $3$-approximation algorithm by Chakraborty et al. (CALDAM, 2020)
and show that it remains NP-hard even for subcubic partial grids of arbitrary
girth. This unifies some results in the literature. We then turn our attention
to chordal graphs, showing that \textsc{MGS} is fixed parameter tractable for
inputs of this class when parameterized by its \emph{tree-width} (which equals
its clique number). This implies a polynomial-time algorithm for $k$-trees, for
fixed $k$. Then, we show that \textsc{MGS} is NP-hard on interval graphs,
thereby answering a question of Ekim et al. (LATIN, 2012). As interval graphs
are very constrained, to prove the latter result we design a rather
sophisticated reduction technique to work around their inherent linear

(C$_{14}$H$_{10}$). The experiment is performed in the apparatus that combines

C$_{70}$$^+$), smaller fullerene cations C$_{(60-2n)}$$^+$, n=1-8 or
C$_{(70-2m)}$$^+$, m=1-11 are generated, respectively. Then reacting with

  A successive loss of C$_2$ fragments mechanism is suggested to account for
the formation of smaller fullerene cations, which then undergo addition

cations. It is found that the higher laser energy and longer irradiation time
are key factors that affect the formation of smaller fullerene cations. This
may indicate that in the strong radiation field environment (such as
photon-dominated regions) in space, fullerenes are expected to follow the
top-down evolution route, and then form small grain dust (e.g., clusters)
through collision reaction with co-existing molecules, here, smaller PAHs.

multiple-output (MIMO) system over line-of-sight (LoS) environments in which
array misalignment exists. In particular, optimal antenna placement in UCAs and
transceiver architectures to achieve the maximum channel capacity without the
knowledge of misalignment components are presented. To this end, we first
derive a generic channel model of UCA-based LoS MIMO systems in which three
misalignment factors including relative array rotation, tilting and
center-shift are reflected concurrently. By factorizing the channel matrix into
the singular value decomposition (SVD) form, we demonstrate that the singular
values of UCA-based LoS MIMO systems are \textit{independent} of tilting and
center-shift. Rather, they can be expressed as a function of the \textit{radii
product-to-distance ratio} (RPDR) and the angle of relative array rotation.
Numerical analyses of singular values show that the RPDR is a key design
parameter of UCA systems. Based on this result, we propose an optimal design
method for UCA systems which performs a one-dimensional search of RPDR to
maximize channel capacity. It is observed that the channel matrix of the
optimally designed UCA system is close to an orthogonal matrix; this fact
allows channel capacity to be achieved by a simple zero-forcing (ZF) receiver.
Additionally, we propose a low-complexity precoding scheme for UCA systems in
which the optimal design criteria cannot be fulfilled because of limits on
array size. The simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed
design method and transceiver architectures.

discrete alternatives. We employ the `repeated-choice' (RC) model to study
network formation. We argue that the RC model overcomes important limitations
of the multinomial logit (MNL) model, which gives one framework for studying
network formation, and that it is well-suited to study network formation. We
also illustrate how to use the RC model to accurately study network formation
using both synthetic and real-world networks. Using edge-independent synthetic

  Vertical $WSe_2$ Schottky Junction Solar Cells",,,,,"physics.app-ph cond-mat.mtrl-sci","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials have emerged as promising
candidates for thin film solar cells due to their wide bandgap range across the
visible wavelengths, high absorption coefficient and ease of integration with
both arbitrary substrates as well as conventional semiconductor technologies.
However, reported TMD-based solar cells suffer from relatively low external
quantum efficiencies (EQE) and low open circuit voltage due to unoptimized
design and device fabrication. This paper studies $Pt/WSe_2$ vertical Schottky
junction solar cells with various $WSe_2$ thicknesses in order to find the
optimum absorber thickness.Also, we show that the photovoltaic performance can
be improved via $Al_2O_3$ passivation which increases the EQE by up to 29.5% at
410 nm wavelength incident light. The overall resulting short circuit current
improves through antireflection coating, surface doping, and surface trap
passivation effects. Thanks to the ${Al_2O_3}$ coating, this work demonstrates
a device with open circuit voltage ($V_{OC}$) of 380 mV and short circuit
current density ($J_{SC}$) of 10.7 $mA/cm^2$. Finally, the impact of Schottky
barrier height inhomogeneity at the $Pt/WSe_2$ contact is investigated as a
source of open circuit voltage lowering in these devices

the effects of modifications of the quark structure inside individual nucleons
when they are within a high-density nuclear medium. With a unique set of five
well-constrained adjustable parameters, which have a clear physical basis, the
QMC model gives predictions for the ground state observables of even-even
nuclei which agree with experiment as well as traditional models. Furthermore,
it gives improved theoretical values for nuclei thought to play a role in the
outer crusts of neutron stars but for which experimental data is not available.
Using the latest experimental data tables wherever possible but otherwise the

equilibrium sequence of crustal layers, each characterized by a particular
neutron rich nuclei. Various properties of the layers are calculated for a

exploration for deep architectures that often converge slower than shallow ones

hybrid quantum interface that interconnects photons, electrons, and phonons
through a wavelength-tunable quantum structure embedded in its free-standing
structure. In such a nanomechanical element, however, a challenge is how to
detect and manipulate a small number of phonons via its tiny mechanical motion.
A solution would be to couple an optical cavity to a nanowire by introducing
the ``cavity optomechanics'' framework, but the typical size difference between
them becomes a barrier to achieving this. Here, we demonstrate near-field
coupling of a silica microsphere cavity and an epitaxially grown InP/InAs
free-standing nanowire. The evanescent optomechanical coupling enables not only
fine probing of the mechanical motion by balanced homodyne interferometry but
also tuning of the resonance frequency, linewidth, Duffing nonlinearity, and
vibration axis in the nanowire. Combining this cavity optomechanics with
epitaxial nanowire engineering opens the way to novel quantum metrology and
information processing.

propose a novel distributed approach that simultaneously clusters and fits
autoregression models for groups of similar individuals. We apply a Wishart
mixture model so as to cluster individuals while modeling the corresponding
autocovariance matrices at the same time. The fitted Wishart scale matrices map
to cluster-level autoregressive coefficients through the Yule-Walker equations,
fitting robust parsimonious autoregressive mixture models. This approach is
able to discern differences in underlying autocorrelation variation of time

LPWAN technology is the attacks that block legitimate communication between
nodes resulting in scenarios like loss of packets, delayed packet arrival, and
skewed packet reaching the reporting gateway. LoRa (Long Range) is a promising
wireless radio access technology that supports long-range communication at low
data rates and low power consumption. LoRa is considered as one of the ideal
candidates for building LPWANs. We use LoRa as a reference technology to review
the IoT security threats on the air and the applicability of different
countermeasures that have been adopted so far. LoRa nodes that are close to the
gateway use a small SF than the nodes which are far away. But it also implies
long in-the-air transmission time, which makes the transmitted packets
vulnerable to different kinds of malicious attacks, especially in the physical
and the link layer. Therefore, it is not possible to enforce a fixed set of
rules for all LoRa nodes since they have different levels of vulnerabilities.
Our survey reveals that there is an urgent need for secure and uninterrupted
communication between an end-device and the gateway, especially when the threat
models are unknown in advance. We explore the traditional countermeasures and
find that most of them are ineffective now, such as frequency hopping and
spread spectrum methods. In order to adapt to new threats, the emerging
countermeasures using game-theoretic approaches and reinforcement machine
learning methods can effectively identify threats and dynamically choose the
corresponding actions to resist threats, thereby making secured and reliable
communications.

predicted based on an understanding of the individual agents. Typically, robot
behavior is governed by algorithms that optimize a reward function that should
quantitatively capture the joint system's goal. Although reward functions can
be updated to better match human needs, this is no guarantee that no
misalignment with the complex and variable human needs will occur. Algorithms
may learn undesirable behavior when interacting with the human and the
intrinsically unpredictable human-inhabited world, thereby producing further
misalignment with human users or bystanders. As a result, humans might behave
differently than anticipated, causing robots to learn differently and
undesirable behavior to emerge. With this short paper, we state that to design
for Human-Robot Interaction that mitigates such undesirable emergent behavior,
we need to complement advancements in human-robot interaction algorithms with
human factors knowledge and expertise. More specifically, we advocate a
three-pronged approach that we illustrate using a particularly challenging
example of safety-critical human-robot interaction: a driver interacting with a
semi-automated vehicle. Undesirable emergent behavior should be mitigated by a
combination of 1) including driver behavioral mechanisms in the vehicle's
algorithms and reward functions, 2) model-based approaches that account for
interaction-induced driver behavioral adaptations and 3) driver-centered
interaction design that promotes driver engagement with the semi-automated
vehicle, and the transparent communication of each agent's actions that allows
mutual support and adaptation. We provide examples from recent empirical work
in our group, in the hope this proves to be fruitful for discussing emergent
human-robot interaction.

dimensions $x_{1},\ldots, x_{n} \in R^{d}$, an integer $1 \leq k \leq d$, and
an outlier parameter $0 \leq \alpha \leq 1$, is to find a $k$-dimensional
linear subspace of $R^{d}$ that minimizes the sum of squared distances to its
nearest $(1-\alpha)n$ points. More generally, the $\ell_{p}$ subspace
approximation problem with outliers minimizes the sum of $p$-th powers of
distances instead of the sum of squared distances. Even the case of robust PCA
is non-trivial, and previous work requires additional assumptions on the input.
Any multiplicative approximation algorithm for the subspace approximation
problem with outliers must solve the robust subspace recovery problem, a
special case in which the $(1-\alpha)n$ inliers in the optimal solution are
promised to lie exactly on a $k$-dimensional linear subspace. However, robust
subspace recovery is Small Set Expansion (SSE)-hard.
  We show how to extend dimension reduction techniques and bi-criteria
approximations based on sampling to the problem of subspace approximation with
outliers. To get around the SSE-hardness of robust subspace recovery, we assume
that the squared distance error of the optimal $k$-dimensional subspace summed
over the optimal $(1-\alpha)n$ inliers is at least $\delta$ times its
squared-error summed over all $n$ points, for some $0 < \delta \leq 1 -

of $poly(k/\epsilon) \log(1/\delta) \log\log(1/\delta)$ points whose span
contains a $k$-dimensional subspace that gives a multiplicative
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to the optimal solution. The running time of our
algorithm is linear in $n$ and $d$. Interestingly, our results hold even when
the fraction of outliers $\alpha$ is large, as long as the obvious condition $0

bandwidth, resulting in undesirable compression artifacts. Recently, extensive
approaches have been proposed to reduce image compression artifacts at the
decoder side; however, they require a series of architecture-identical models
to process images with different quality, which are inefficient and
resource-consuming. Besides, it is common in practice that compressed images
are with unknown quality and it is intractable for existing approaches to
select a suitable model for blind quality enhancement. In this paper, we
propose a resource-efficient blind quality enhancement (RBQE) approach for
compressed images. Specifically, our approach blindly and progressively
enhances the quality of compressed images through a dynamic deep neural network
(DNN), in which an early-exit strategy is embedded. Then, our approach can
automatically decide to terminate or continue enhancement according to the
assessed quality of enhanced images. Consequently, slight artifacts can be
removed in a simpler and faster process, while the severe artifacts can be
further removed in a more elaborate process. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our RBQE approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
blind quality enhancement and resource efficiency. The code is available at

pore size much smaller than the radius of the diffusing PPO chains, thus
inducing entropic barriers that hinder the diffusion process. From the

performing model compression and learned-label smoothing. However, in this

study its efficacy in training a deeper network without any residual

perform equally or better than their residual versions trained on raw data
without KD (baseline network). Surprisingly, in some cases, they surpass the
accuracy of baseline networks even with the inferior teachers. After a certain
depth of non-residual student network, the accuracy drop, coming from the
removal of residual connections, is substantial, and training with KD boosts
the accuracy of the student up to a great extent; however, it does not fully
recover the accuracy drop. Furthermore, we observe that the conventional
teacher-student view of KD is incomplete and does not adequately explain our
findings. We propose a novel interpretation of KD with the Trainee-Mentor

Instead, both resonance and continuum contributions to the spectral density are
solved with the operator-product-expansion input on the quark side by treating
sum rules as an inverse problem. This new formalism does not involve the
continuum threshold, does not require the Borel transformation and stability
analysis, and can be extended to extract properties of excited states. Taking
the two-current correlator as an example, we demonstrate that the series of
$\rho$ resonances can emerge in our formalism, and the decay constants
$f_{\rho(770)} (f_{\rho(1450)},f_{\rho(1700)},f_{\rho(1900)})\approx$ 0.22

$\Gamma_{\rho(770)}\approx 0.17$ GeV can be obtained by substituting a
Breit-Wigner parametrization for the $\rho(770)$ pole on the hadron side. It is
observed that quark condensates of dimension-six on the quark side are crucial
for establishing those $\rho$ resonances. Handling the conventional sum rules
with the duality assumption as an inverse problem, we find that the multiple
pole sum rules widely adopted in the literature do not describe the $\rho$
excitations reasonably. The precision of our theoretical outcomes can be
improved systematically by including higher-order and higher-power corrections
on the quark side. Broad applications of this formalism to abundant low energy

prognosis are invariably linked to availability of a representation of the
system, which bears physical connotation. In this context, it is often
desirable to assimilate data and models, into what is often termed a digital
twin of the monitored system.
  One common take to such an end lies in exploitation of structural mechanics
models, relying on use of Finite Element approximations. proper updating of
these models, and their incorporation in an inverse problem setting may allow
for damage quantification and localization, as well as more advanced tasks,
including reliability analysis and fatigue assessment. However, this may only
be achieved by means of repetitive analyses of the forward model, which implies
considerable computational toll, when the model used is a detailed FE
representation. In tackling this issue, reduced order models can be adopted,
which retain the parameterisation and link to the parameters regulating the
physical properties, albeit greatly reducing the computational burden.
  In this work a detailed FE model of a wind turbine tower is considered,
reduced forms of this model are found using both the Craig Bampton and Dual
Craig Bampton methods. These reduced order models are then used and compared in
a Transitional Markov Chain Monte Carlo procedure to localise and quantify

$Z=1.0-0.01~Z_\odot$ range was studied with a particular emphasis on the
strength of gravitational instability and the nature of protostellar accretion
in low-metallicity systems. Numerical hydrodynamics simulations in the
thin-disk limit were employed that feature separate gas and dust temperatures,
and disk mass-loading from the infalling parental cloud cores. Models with
cloud cores of similar initial mass and rotation pattern, but distinct
metallicity were considered to distinguish the effect of metallicity from that
of initial conditions. The early stages of disk evolution in low-metallicity
models are characterized by vigorous gravitational instability and
fragmentation. Disk instability is sustained by continual mass-loading from the
collapsing core. The time period that is covered by this unstable stage is much
shorter in the $Z=0.01~Z_\odot$ models as compared to their higher metallicity
counterparts thanks to the higher mass infall rates caused by higher gas
temperatures (that decouple from lower dust temperatures) in the inner parts of
collapsing cores. Protostellar accretion rates are highly variable in the
low-metallicity models reflecting a highly dynamical nature of the
corresponding protostellar disks. The low-metallicity systems feature short,
but energetic episodes of mass accretion caused by infall of inward-migrating
gaseous clumps that form via gravitational fragmentation of protostellar disks.
These bursts seem to be more numerous and last longer in the $Z=0.1~Z_\odot$
models in comparison to the $Z=0.01~Z_\odot$ case. Variable protostellar
accretion with episodic bursts is not a particular feature of solar metallicity
disks. It is also inherent to gravitationally unstable disks with metallicities
up to 100 times lower than solar.

correlators can be viewed mathematically as an illustration of the transseries
concept, which allows to recover a function from its asymptotic divergent
expansion. Alternatively, starting from the divergent behavior of the
perturbative QCD encoded in the singularities in the Borel plane, a modified
expansion can be defined by means of the conformal mapping of this plane. A
comparison of the two approaches concerning their ability to recover
nonperturbative properties of the true correlator was not explored up to now.
In the present paper, we make a first attempt to investigate this problem. We
use for illustration the Adler function and observables expressed as integrals
of this function along contours in the complex energy plane. We show that the
expansions based on the conformal mapping of the Borel plane go beyond
finite-order perturbation theory, containing an infinite number of terms when
reexpanded in powers of the coupling. Moreover, the expansion functions exhibit
nonperturbative features of the true function, while the expansions have a
tamed behavior at large orders and are expected even to be convergent. Using
these properties, we argue that there are no mathematical reasons for
supplementing the expansions based on the conformal mapping of the Borel plane
by additional arbitrary power corrections. Therefore, we make the conjecture
that they provide an alternative to the standard OPE in approximating the QCD
correlator. This conjecture allows to slightly improve the accuracy of the
strong coupling extracted from the hadronic $\tau$ decay width. Using the
optimal expansions based on conformal mapping and the contour-improved
prescription of renormalization-group resummation, we obtain
$\alpha_s(m_\tau^2)=0.314 \pm 0.006$, which implies $\alpha_s(m_Z^2)=0.1179 \pm
0.0008$.

environmental datasets accessible to everyone. For analysing such datasets,
including spatiotemporal correlations using traditional models based on

assumptions about stationarity, separability, and distance measures of
covariance functions that are often unrealistic for global data. Only very few
modeling approaches suitably model spatiotemporal correlations while addressing
both computational scalability as well as flexible covariance models. In this
paper, we provide an extension to the multi-resolution approximation (MRA)
approach for spatiotemporal modeling of global datasets. MRA has been shown to
be computationally scalable in distributed computing environments and allows
for integrating arbitrary user-defined covariance functions. Our extension adds
a spatiotemporal partitioning, and fitting of complex covariance models
including nonstationarity with kernel convolutions and spherical distances. We
evaluate the effect of the MRA parameters on estimation and spatiotemporal
prediction using simulated data, where computation times reduced around two
orders of magnitude with an increase of the root-mean-square prediction error
of around five percent. This allows for trading off computation times against
prediction errors, and we derive a practical strategy for selecting the MRA
parameters. We demonstrate how the approach can be practically used for
analyzing daily sea surface temperature and precipitation data on global scale

system functionality when learning arbitrary non-linear relations in
low-dimensional sensory data. Here, an initial benefit rises from the fact that
such a network can be engineered in a relatively straightforward way without
prior information about the sensors and their interactions. Moreover,
alleviating the need for tedious modelling and parametrization, the network
converges to a consistent description of any arbitrary high-dimensional

between physical quantities such as light intensity, spatial gradient, and
optical flow, describing a visual scene. Overall, the benefits of such a

  Aims. We aim to use a detailed modeling tool to reproduce the effect of
active regions on radial velocity measurements, which aids the identification
of the key parameters that have an impact on the induced variability.
  Methods. We analyzed the effect of stellar activity on radial velocities as a
function of wavelength by simulating the impact of the properties of spots,
shifts induced by convective motions, and rotation. We focused our modeling
effort on the active star YZ CMi (GJ 285), which was photometrically and
spectroscopically monitored with CARMENES and the Telescopi Joan Or\'o.
  Results. We demonstrate that radial velocity curves at different wavelengths
yield determinations of key properties of active regions, including spot
filling factor, temperature contrast, and location, thus solving the degeneracy
between them. Most notably, our model is also sensitive to convective motions.
Results indicate a reduced convective shift for M dwarfs when compared to
solar-type stars (in agreement with theoretical extrapolations) and points to a
small global convective redshift instead of blueshift.
  Conclusions. Using a novel approach based on simultaneous chromatic radial
velocities and light curves, we can set strong constraints on stellar activity,
including an elusive parameter such as the net convective motion effect.

decompose large structural systems into multiple coupled subsystems. This
decomposition has the principle benefit of reducing computational time for
dynamic simulation of the system. In this context, DS methods may form an
essential component of hybrid simulation, wherein they can be used to couple
physical and numerical substructures at reduced computational cost. Since most
engineered systems are inherently nonlinear, particular potential lies in
incorporating nonlinear methods in existing substructuring schemes which are
largely linear methods.
  The most widely used and studied DS methods are classical linear techniques
such as the Craig-Bampton (CB) method. However, as linear methods they
naturally break down in the presence of nonlinearities. Recent advancements in
substructuring have involved the development of enrichments to linear methods,
which allow for some degree of nonlinearity to be captured. The use of mode
shape derivatives has been shown to be able to capture geometrically non-linear
effects as an extension to the CBmethod. Other candidates include the method of
Finite Element Tearing and Interconnecting.

elastic vehicle frame supported on four nonlinear spring damper isolators is
decomposed into separate domains. One domain consisting of the finite element
model of the vehicle frame, which is reduced using the CB method. The second
domain consists of the nonlinear isolators whose restoring forces are

diverges at $\Lambda=0^{+}$), identifying the observed $\Lambda_{\rm obs}$ to

which are comparable to direct Ewald summation. We show that compared to

the Kreuzer-Skarke toric hypersurface dataset, generalized CICYs etc., totaling
at least on the order of 10^10 manifolds. These all contribute to the vast

compactification. More recently, this collaboration has been enriched by
computer science and data science, the former, in bench-marking the complexity
of the algorithms in computing geometric quantities and the latter, in applying
techniques such as machine-learning in extracting unexpected information. These

nodules in our dataset. The resulting feature vectors were classified into two
(benign/malignant) and three (benign/primary lung cancer/metastases) classes
using support vector machine (SVM). This classification was performed both on
nodule- and scan-level. We obtained state-of-the art performance for detection
and malignancy regression on the LIDC-IDRI database. Classification performance
on our own dataset was higher for scan- than for nodule-level predictions. For
the three-class scan-level classification we obtained an accuracy of 78\%.
Spectral features did increase classifier performance, but not significantly.
Our work suggests that a pre-trained feature extractor can be used as primary
tumor origin classifier for lung nodules, eliminating the need for elaborate
fine-tuning of a new network and large datasets. Code is available at

studies which provided novel insight into the photochemistry of hydrogen-bonded
complexes of the heptazine (Hz) chromophore with hydroxylic substrate molecules
(water and phenol). It was found that a functionalized derivative of Hz,
tri-anisole-heptazine (TAHz), can photooxidize water and phenol in a
homogeneous photochemical reaction. This allows the exploration of the basic
mechanisms of the proton-coupled electron-transfer (PCET) process involved in
the water photooxidation reaction in well-defined complexes of chemically
tunable molecular chromophores with chemically tunable substrate molecules. The
unique properties of the excited electronic states of the Hz molecule and
derivatives thereof are highlighted. The potential energy landscape relevant
for the PCET reaction has been characterized by judicious computational
studies. These data provided the basis for the demonstration of rational laser
control of PCET reactions in TAHz-phenol complexes by pump-push-probe
spectroscopy, which sheds light on the branching mechanisms occurring by the
interaction of nonreactive locally excited states of the chromophore with
reactive intermolecular charge-transfer states. Extrapolating from these
results, we propose a general scenario which unravels the complex photoinduced
water-splitting reaction into simple sequential light-driven one-electron redox
reactions followed by simple dark radical-radical recombination reactions.

localized on the junction is fixed, and show that a transition from insulating
to conducting state in this case is governed by single-quasiparticle tunneling
rather than by Cooper pair tunneling in contrast to a non-topological Josephson
junction. This results in a significantly lower critical current for the

of the system is finite, the transition from insulating to conducting state
occurs at exponentially higher bias current due to hybridization of the states
with different parities as a result of the overlap of MBSs localized on the

Finally, we discuss how the appearance of MBSs can be established
experimentally by measuring the critical current for an insulating regime at

pansharpening as a colorization problem, which brings an entirely novel
perspective and solution to the problem compared to existing methods that base
their solution solely on producing a super-resolution version of the

panchromatic image as input to their model along with reduced resolution
multispectral images, hence learn to increase their resolution together, we
instead provide the grayscale transformed multispectral image as input, and
train our model to learn the colorization of the grayscale input. We further
address the fixed downscale ratio assumption during training, which does not
generalize well to the full-resolution scenario. We introduce a noise injection
into the training by randomly varying the downsampling ratios. Those two
critical changes, along with the addition of adversarial training in the
proposed PanColorization Generative Adversarial Networks (PanColorGAN)

observed in CNN-based pansharpening. The proposed approach outperforms the

of robust estimators for regression are adaptive modified maximum likelihood

so-called leverage points. In this study, we propose a new regression estimator
by employing an appropriate weighting scheme in the AMML estimation method. The
resulting estimator is called robust AMML (RAMML) since it is not only robust
to y outliers but also to x outliers. A simulation study is carried out to
compare the performance of the RAMML estimator with some existing robust

working temperature inside a concentrator (90{\deg}C), while the nominal
photo-current (500 suns) has been emulated by injecting current in darkness.
The failure distributions have been fitted to an Arrhenius-Weibull model

After the ALT, an intense characterization campaign has been carried out in

alone is enough to degrade the cell performance by increasing the leakage
currents, the series resistance, and the recombination currents. When solar
cells were also forward biased an increase of series resistance together with a
reduction of short circuit current is detected. The failure analysis shows
that: a) several metallization sub-products concentrate in several regions of
front metal grid where they poison the silver, resulting in a two times
reduction of the metal sheet resistance; b) the metal/cap layer interface is
greatly degraded and there is also a deterioration of the cap layer crystalline
quality producing a huge increase of the specific front contact resistance, c)
the decrease of short circuit current is mainly due to the GaInP top subcell

distributions and associated clustering algorithms that allow for integrating
robustness and skewness into a single unified cluster analysis framework.
Non-symmetrically distributed and heavy-tailed data clusters have been reported
in a variety of real-world applications. Robustness is essential because a few
outlying observations can severely obscure the cluster structure. The RESK
distributions are a generalization of the Real Elliptically Symmetric (RES)
distributions. To estimate the cluster parameters and memberships, we derive an
expectation maximization (EM) algorithm for arbitrary RESK distributions.
Special attention is given to a new robust skew-Huber M-estimator, which is
also the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the skew-Huber distribution
that belongs to the RESK class. Numerical experiments on simulated and
real-world data confirm the usefulness of the proposed methods for skewed and
heavy-tailed data sets.

effective prior in image restoration. However, for single image
super-resolution (SISR), most existing deep non-local methods (e.g., non-local
neural networks) only exploit similar patches within the same scale of the
low-resolution (LR) input image. Consequently, the restoration is limited to
using the same-scale information while neglecting potential high-resolution
(HR) cues from other scales. In this paper, we explore the cross-scale patch
recurrence property of a natural image, i.e., similar patches tend to recur
many times across different scales. This is achieved using a novel cross-scale
internal graph neural network (IGNN). Specifically, we dynamically construct a
cross-scale graph by searching k-nearest neighboring patches in the downsampled
LR image for each query patch in the LR image. We then obtain the corresponding
k HR neighboring patches in the LR image and aggregate them adaptively in
accordance to the edge label of the constructed graph. In this way, the HR
information can be passed from k HR neighboring patches to the LR query patch
to help it recover more detailed textures. Besides, these internal
image-specific LR/HR exemplars are also significant complements to the external
information learned from the training dataset. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of IGNN against the state-of-the-art SISR methods
including existing non-local networks on standard benchmarks.

Needle placement is a challenging problem for applications such as
biopsy or brachytherapy. Tip force sensing can provide valuable feedback for
needle navigation inside the tissue. For this purpose, fiber-optical sensors
can be directly integrated into the needle tip. Optical coherence tomography
(OCT) can be used to image tissue. Here, we study how to calibrate OCT to sense
forces, e.g. during robotic needle placement.
  Methods. We investigate whether using raw spectral OCT data without a typical
image reconstruction can improve a deep learning-based calibration between
optical signal and forces. For this purpose, we consider three different
needles with a new, more robust design which are calibrated using convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). We compare training the CNNs with the raw OCT signal
and the reconstructed depth profiles.
  Results. We find that using raw data as an input for the largest CNN model
outperforms the use of reconstructed data with a mean absolute error of 5.81 mN
compared to 8.04 mN.
  Conclusions. We find that deep learning with raw spectral OCT data can
improve learning for the task of force estimation. Our needle design and
calibration approach constitute a very accurate fiber-optical sensor for
measuring forces at the needle tip.

seemingly unrelated pattern formations can also be studied via the model, like

the computational time, representing a huge advantage compared to traditional

two significant advances. The first is the development a simple stochastic
learning rule called cyclic STDP that can extract patterns encoded in the
precise spiking times of a group of neurons. We show that a population of
neurons endowed with this learning rule can act as an effective short-term
associative memory, storing and reliably recalling a large set of pattern
associations over an extended period of time.
  The second major theme examines the challenges associated with training a
neuron to produce a spike at a precise time and for the fidelity of spike
recall time to be maintained as further learning occurs. The strong constraint
of working with precisely-timed spikes (so-called temporal coding) is mandated
by the learning rule but is also consistent with the believe in the necessity
of such an encoding scheme to render a spiking neural network a competitive
solution for flexible intelligent systems in continuous learning environments.
  The encoding and learning rules are demonstrated in the design of a
single-layer associative memory (an input layer consisting of 3,200 spiking
neurons fully-connected to a similar sized population of memory neurons), which
we simulate and characterise. Design considerations and clarification of the

states that can achieve the maximum nonclassicality in the asymptotic limit of
large mean number of excitations. These states can provide the same sensitivity

We also discover that the nonclassicality of certain states can be greatly
improved with a single-photon addition. Besides, we explore some examples on
how to evaluate analytically the nonclassicality of mixed states, which are in

sample of galaxies with an estimate of the dust attenuation computed from the

in redshift bins, was modelled by a single parameter linear function, assuming
a nonzero constant apparent dust attenuation for low mass galaxies. But the
origin of this effect is still to be determined and several possibilities are
explored (actual high dust content, variation of the dust-to-metal ratio,
variation of the stars-dust geometry). The best-fitting parameter of this model
is then used to study the redshift evolution of the cosmic dust attenuation and
is found to be in agreement with results from the literature. This work also
gives evidence to a redshift evolution of the dust attenuation - stellar mass
relationship, as is suggested by recent works in the highest redshift range.

observation of representative astrophysical DM targets, namely dwarf spheroidal
galaxies. In particular, we focus on Draco and Sculptor, two well-known dwarfs
visible from the Northern and Southern Hemisphere, respectively. For each of
these targets, we simulated 300\,h of CTA observations and studied the
sensitivity of both CTA-North and CTA-South to branon annihilations using the
latest publicly available instrument response functions and most recent
analysis tools. We computed annihilation cross section values needed to reach a
$5\sigma$ detection as a function of the branon mass. Additionally, in the
absence of a predicted DM signal, we obtained $2\sigma$ upper limits on the
annihilation cross section. These limits lie $1.5-2$ orders of magnitude above
the thermal relic cross section value, depending on the considered branon mass.
Yet, CTA will allow to exclude a significant portion of the brane tension-mass
parameter space in the $0.1-60$ TeV branon mass range, and up to tensions of
$\sim 10$ TeV. More importantly, CTA will significantly enlarge the region
already excluded by AMS and CMS, and will provide valuable complementary

(MDP) optimization, is a important challenge in artificial intelligence. Two
key approaches to this problem are reinforcement learning (RL) and planning.
This paper presents a survey of the integration of both fields, better known as
model-based reinforcement learning. Model-based RL has two main steps. First,
we systematically cover approaches to dynamics model learning, including
challenges like dealing with stochasticity, uncertainty, partial observability,
and temporal abstraction. Second, we present a systematic categorization of
planning-learning integration, including aspects like: where to start planning,
what budgets to allocate to planning and real data collection, how to plan, and
how to integrate planning in the learning and acting loop. After these two
sections, we also discuss implicit model-based RL as an end-to-end alternative
for model learning and planning, and we cover the potential benefits of
model-based RL. Along the way, the survey also draws connections to several
related RL fields, like hierarchical RL and transfer learning. Altogether, the
survey presents a broad conceptual overview of the combination of planning and
learning for MDP optimization.

coins will be transferred in the future. This work introduces deleted-key
covenants; using pre-signed transactions with secure key deletion. With this, a
general class of covenants are possible without introducing new security risks
to bitcoin. There is a range of security models for the key deletion process,
but this is subject to a security-convenience trade-off and requires
interactivity in a multi-party context. On the other hand, this work makes a
compelling case for what can be gained through a soft-fork upgrade to the
signature hash system [Dec17] which enables recovered-key covenants through
elliptic curve key recovery. This has similar properties to script-based
covenant mechanisms proposed previously [Rub20]. Key factors are discussed and
compared for the three covenant mechanisms, including; the enforcement process,
methods for proving accessibility of funds and whether or not they are bound by
a covenant, methods for dynamic fee allocation, the underlying cryptographic
assumptions, and their feasibility in single-party, hierarchical and
adversarial multi-party contexts. Despite the relative downsides of deleted-key
covenants, they are a practical tool for custody protocol design. The
comparison shows precisely how soft-fork proposals improve the practicality of
bitcoin covenants, through non-interactive enforcement and tighter
cryptographic assumptions, to enhance custody protocols and enable some
adversarial applications such as payment protocols.

may be wrong or incomplete in real-world applications. Although existing
question answering systems have considered the external information, such as
categorical attributes and triples in knowledge base, they all assume that the
external information is correct and complete. To alleviate the effect of
defective condition values, this paper proposes condition aware and revise
Transformer (CAR-Transformer). CAR-Transformer (1) revises each condition value
based on the whole conversation and original conditions values, and (2) it
encodes the revised conditions and utilizes the conditions embedding to select
an answer. Experimental results on a real-world customer service dataset
demonstrate that the CAR-Transformer can still select an appropriate reply when
conditions corresponding to the question exist wrong or missing values, and
substantially outperforms baseline models on automatic and human evaluations.
The proposed CAR-Transformer can be extended to other NLP tasks which need to
consider conditioning information.

improve the data process capability, throughput, and expand the bandwidth, thus

algorithm based on Long Short Term Memory(LSTM) deep neural network is proposed
through which the coverage area of base station changes according to geographic
traffic distribution, catering the requirement for future generation 6G

three different scenarios, and the results were presented. Load variance

as in machine learning and artificial intelligence research is to ascertain
whether two or more decision makers (be they brains or algorithms) use the same
strategy. Accuracy alone cannot distinguish between strategies: two systems may
achieve similar accuracy with very different strategies. The need to
differentiate beyond accuracy is particularly pressing if two systems are near
ceiling performance, like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and humans on
visual object recognition. Here we introduce trial-by-trial error consistency,
a quantitative analysis for measuring whether two decision making systems
systematically make errors on the same inputs. Making consistent errors on a
trial-by-trial basis is a necessary condition for similar processing strategies
between decision makers. Our analysis is applicable to compare algorithms with
algorithms, humans with humans, and algorithms with humans. When applying error
consistency to object recognition we obtain three main findings: (1.)
Irrespective of architecture, CNNs are remarkably consistent with one another.
(2.) The consistency between CNNs and human observers, however, is little above
what can be expected by chance alone -- indicating that humans and CNNs are
likely implementing very different strategies. (3.) CORnet-S, a recurrent model
termed the ""current best model of the primate ventral visual stream"", fails to
capture essential characteristics of human behavioural data and behaves
essentially like a standard purely feedforward ResNet-50 in our analysis. Taken
together, error consistency analysis suggests that the strategies used by human

general-purpose error consistency analysis to serve as a fruitful tool for
quantifying future progress.

from star cluster to galaxy. This suggests there exists a fundamental physics
which regulates the star formation and stellar density. However, factors that
determine this maximum limit are not clear. In this study, we show that
$\Sigma^{\max}_{*}$ of galaxies is not a constant as previous work reported,
but actually depends on the stellar mass. We select galaxy sample from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12 at $z=0.01-0.5$. In contrast to a
constant maximum predicted by theoretical models, $\Sigma^{\max}_{*}$ strongly
depends on stellar mass especially for less massive galaxies with
$\sim10^{10}$M$_{\odot}$. We also found that a majority of high-$\Sigma_{*}$
galaxies show red colours and low star-formation rates. These galaxies probably
reach the $\Sigma^{\max}_{*}$ as a consequence of the galaxy evolution from
blue star forming to red quiescent by quenching star formation. One possible
explanation of the stellar-mass dependency of $\Sigma^{\max}_{*}$ is a mass
dependent efficiency of stellar feedback. The stellar feedback could be
relatively more efficient in a shallower gravitational potential, which
terminates star formation quickly before the stellar system reaches a high
stellar density.

recommendation models are usually learned from users' news click behaviors.
Usually the behaviors of users with the same sensitive attributes (e.g.,
genders) have similar patterns and news recommendation models can easily
capture these patterns. It may lead to some biases related to sensitive user
attributes in the recommendation results, e.g., always recommending sports news
to male users, which is unfair since users may not receive diverse news
information. In this paper, we propose a fairness-aware news recommendation
approach with decomposed adversarial learning and orthogonality regularization,
which can alleviate unfairness in news recommendation brought by the biases of
sensitive user attributes. In our approach, we propose to decompose the user
interest model into two components. One component aims to learn a bias-aware
user embedding that captures the bias information on sensitive user attributes,
and the other aims to learn a bias-free user embedding that only encodes
attribute-independent user interest information for fairness-aware news
recommendation. In addition, we propose to apply an attribute prediction task
to the bias-aware user embedding to enhance its ability on bias modeling, and
we apply adversarial learning to the bias-free user embedding to remove the
bias information from it. Moreover, we propose an orthogonality regularization
method to encourage the bias-free user embeddings to be orthogonal to the
bias-aware one to better distinguish the bias-free user embedding from the
bias-aware one. For fairness-aware news ranking, we only use the bias-free user
embedding. Extensive experiments on benchmark dataset show that our approach
can effectively improve fairness in news recommendation with minor performance
loss.

attentions for their efficiency to process large scale data. Many distributed
frameworks have been proposed for different machine learning tasks. In this
paper, we study the distributed kernel regression via the divide and conquer
approach. This approach has been proved asymptotically minimax optimal if the
kernel is perfectly selected so that the true regression function lies in the
associated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. However, this is usually, if not
always, impractical because kernels that can only be selected via prior
knowledge or a tuning process are hardly perfect. Instead it is more common
that the kernel is good enough but imperfect in the sense that the true
regression can be well approximated by but does not lie exactly in the kernel
space. We show distributed kernel regression can still achieves capacity
independent optimal rate in this case. To this end, we first establish a
general framework that allows to analyze distributed regression with response
weighted base algorithms by bounding the error of such algorithms on a single
data set, provided that the error bounds has factored the impact of the
unexplained variance of the response variable. Then we perform a leave one out
analysis of the kernel ridge regression and bias corrected kernel ridge
regression, which in combination with the aforementioned framework allows us to
derive sharp error bounds and capacity independent optimal rates for the
associated distributed kernel regression algorithms. As a byproduct of the
thorough analysis, we also prove the kernel ridge regression can achieve rates
faster than $N^{-1}$ (where $N$ is the sample size) in the noise free setting
which, to our best knowledge, are first observed and novel in regression
learning.

conditions are met, charge transport is necessarily convective, i.e. it cannot
occur without substantial ionic flow, a transport regime that we dub trivial.
We show that the topological requirements that allow these conditions to be
broken are the same that would determine a Thouless' pump mechanism if the
system were subject to a suitably defined time-periodic Hamiltonian. The
occurrence of these requirements determines a non-trivial transport regime
whereby charge can flow without any ionic convection, even in electronic
insulators. These results are first demonstrated with a couple of simple
molecular models that display a quantum pump mechanism upon introduction of a
fictitious time dependence of the atomic positions along a closed loop in

of atomistic simulations. Using formaldehyde as a benchmark system for
intramolecular interactions, a comparative assessment of ML models based on
state-of-the-art variants of deep neural networks (NN), reproducing kernel
Hilbert space (RKHS+F), and kernel ridge regression (KRR) is presented.
Learning curves for energies and atomic forces indicate rapid convergence
towards excellent predictions for B3LYP, MP2, and CCSD(T)-F12 reference results
for modestly sized (in the hundreds) training sets. Typically, learning curve
off-sets decay as one goes from NN (PhysNet) to RKHS+F to KRR (FCHL).
Conversely, the predictive power for extrapolation of energies towards new
geometries increases in the same order with RKHS+F and FCHL performing almost
equally. For harmonic vibrational frequencies, the picture is less clear, with
PhysNet and FCHL yielding respectively flat learning at $\sim$ 1 and $\sim$ 0.2
cm$^{-1}$ no matter which reference method, while RKHS+F models level off for
B3LYP, and exhibit continued improvements for MP2 and CCSD(T)-F12.
Finite-temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the same initial
conditions yield indistinguishable infrared spectra with good performance
compared with experiment except for the high-frequency modes involving hydrogen
stretch motion which is a known limitation of MD for vibrational spectroscopy.
For sufficiently large training set sizes all three models can detect
insufficient convergence (``noise'') of the reference electronic structure
calculations in that the learning curves level off. Transfer learning (TL) from
B3LYP to CCSD(T)-F12 with PhysNet indicates that additional improvements in
data efficiency can be achieved.

Hamiltonians with particle creation is based on interior-boundary conditions

Laplacian operator. Here, we study how the approach can be applied to Dirac
operators. While this has been done successfully already in 1 space dimension,
and more generally for codimension-1 boundaries, the situation of point sources
in 3 dimensions corresponds to a codimension-3 boundary. One would expect that,
for such a boundary, Dirac operators do not allow for boundary conditions
because they are known not to allow for point interactions in 3d, which also
correspond to a boundary condition. And indeed, we confirm this expectation
here by proving that there is no self-adjoint operator on (a truncated) Fock
space that would correspond to a Dirac operator with an IBC at configurations
with a particle at the origin. However, we also present a positive result
showing that there are self-adjoint operators with IBC (on the boundary
consisting of configurations with a particle at the origin) that are, away from
those configurations, given by a Dirac operator plus a sufficiently strong
Coulomb potential.

one of the most well-studied optimization problems spanning many research areas

Traditionally, these problems are solved with the assumption that clients need

the number of facilities required to serve a client, is given. We propose the

challenge is that depending on the sparsity levels, distribution of data, and

static choice does not suffice. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
SpMV/SpMSpV framework, which can automatically select the appropriate

Based on systematic analysis on key factors such as computing pattern, workload

encapsulated into the framework to achieve high performance in a seamless

performed to choose the kernel and adapt with the varieties of both the input

symmetry of the eigenstates of the DSC system in the resonator phase space.
When the resonator couples to the qubit and the environment in different ways
(for instance, one is inductive and the other is capacitive), the system is
almost unaffected by the resonator-waveguide coupling. In contrast, when the
two couplings are of the same type (for instance, both are inductive), by
increasing the resonator-waveguide coupling strength, the average number of
virtual photons increases and the quantum superposition realized in the
qubit-resonator entangled ground state is partially degraded. Since the
superposition becomes more fragile with increasing the qubit-resonator

studies to quantify the effect of surface topography on cell fate. However, the
predicted optimal diameter of nanotubes considerably differs among studies. We
propose a model that explain cell adhesion to nanostructured surface by
considering deformation energy of cell protrusions into titanium nanotubes and
adhesion to surface. The optimal surface topology is defined as a geometry that
gives membrane a minimum energy shape. A dimensionless parameter, the cell
interaction index, was proposed to describe interplay between the cell membrane
bending, intrinsic curvature and strength of cell adhesion. Model simulation
show that optimal nanotube diameter ranging from 20 nm to 100 nm (cell
interaction index between 0.2 and 1, respectively) is feasible within certain
range of parameters describing adhesion and bending energy. The results
indicates a possibility to tune the topology of nanostructural surface in order
to enhance proliferation and differentation of cells mechanically compatible
with given surface geometry while suppress the growth of other mechanically
incompatible cells.

operation that involves every path linking the message sender and receiver with
learnable weights depending on the path length, which corresponds to the
maximal entropy random walk. It generalizes the graph Laplacian to a new
transition matrix we call maximal entropy transition (MET) matrix derived from
a path integral formalism. Importantly, the diagonal entries of the MET matrix
are directly related to the subgraph centrality, thus providing a natural and
adaptive pooling mechanism. PAN provides a versatile framework that can be
tailored for different graph data with varying sizes and structures. We can
view most existing GNN architectures as special cases of PAN. Experimental
results show that PAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on various graph
classification/regression tasks, including a new benchmark dataset from
statistical mechanics we propose to boost applications of GNN in physical

non-differentiable, and each occurs with vanishing probability. This introduces
a gap between theory, where path probabilities are used in many contexts, and
experiment, where only events with non-zero probability are measurable. Here we
bridge this gap by considering the probability of diffusive trajectories to
remain within a tube of small but finite radius around a smooth path. This
probability can be measured in experiment, via the rate at which trajectories
exit the tube for the first time, thereby establishing a link between path
probabilities and physical observables. Considering $N$-dimensional overdamped
Langevin dynamics, we show that the tube probability can be obtained
theoretically from the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation. Expressing the
resulting exit rate as a functional of the path and ordering it as a power
series in the tube radius, we identify the zeroth-order term as the
Onsager-Machlup stochastic action, thereby elevating it from a mathematical
construct to a physical observable. The higher-order terms reveal, for the
first time, the form of the finite-radius contributions which account for
fluctuations around the path. To demonstrate the experimental relevance of this
action functional for tubes, we numerically sample trajectories of Brownian
motion in a double-well potential, compute their exit rate, and show an
excellent agreement with our analytical results. Our work shows that smooth
tubes are surrogates for non-differentiable diffusive trajectories, and provide
a direct way of comparing theoretical results on single trajectories, such as

vacuum is considered as superplastic crystal, and the effective gravity
describes the dynamical elastic deformations of this crystal. In the other one
the gravitational tetrads emerge as the bilinear form of the fermionic fields.
In spite of the essentially different mechanisms of emergent gravity, these two
scenarios have one important common property: the metric field has dimension of
the inverse square of length $[g_{\mu\nu}]=1/[l]^2$, as distinct from the
conventional dimensionless metric, $[g_{\mu\nu}]=1$, in general relativity. As
a result the physical quantities, which obey diffeomorphism invariance, become
dimensionless. This takes place for such quantities as Newton constant, the
scalar curvature, the cosmological constant, particle masses, fermionic and
scalar bosonic fields, etc. This may suggest that the dimensionless physics can
be the natural consequence of the diffeomorphism invariance, and thus can be
the general property of any gravity, which emerges in the quantum vacuum. One
of the nontrivial consequences of the shift of dimensions is related to
topology. Due to the shift of dimensions some operators become topological, and
contain the integer or fractional prefactors in the action. This in particular
concerns the intrinsic 3+1 quantum Hall effect and the Nieh-Yan quantum anomaly
in terms of torsion.

the birth and evolution of the first galaxies and structures in the

observations, and in particular the large-scale E-mode polarization power
spectra (EE PS), to help constrain their highly uncertain parameters. However,
rather than directly forward-modelling the EE PS, most EoR models are
constrained using a summary statistic -- the Thompson scattering optical depth,
$\tau_e$. Compressing CMB observations to $\tau_e$ requires adopting a basis
set for the EoR history. The common choice is the unphysical,
redshift-symmetric hyperbolic tangent (Tanh) function, which differs in shape
from physical EoR models based on hierarchical structure formation. Combining
public EoR and CMB codes, 21cmFAST and CLASS, here we quantify how inference
using the $\tau_e$ summary statistic impacts the resulting constraints on
galaxy properties and EoR histories. Using the last Planck 2018 data release,
we show that the marginalized constraints on the EoR history are more sensitive
to the choice of the basis set (Tanh vs physical model) than to the CMB
likelihood statistic ($\tau_e$ vs PS). For example, EoR histories implied by
the growth of structure show a small tail of partial reionization extending to
higher redshifts. However, biases in inference using $\tau_e$ are negligible
for the Planck 2018 data. Using EoR constraints from high-redshift observations
including the quasar dark fraction, galaxy UV luminosity functions and CMB EE
PS, our physical model recovers $\tau_e=0.0569^{+0.0081}_{-0.0066}$.

without training on the ground-truth clean image (unsupervised) and a image
collection (untrained). An unsupervised neural network will avoid the intensive
labor collection of hazy-clean image pairs, and an untrained model is a
``real'' single image dehazing approach which could remove haze based on only
the observed hazy image itself and no extra images is used. Motivated by the
layer disentanglement idea, we propose a novel method, called you only look
yourself (\textbf{YOLY}) which could be one of the first unsupervised and
untrained neural networks for image dehazing. In brief, YOLY employs three
jointly subnetworks to separate the observed hazy image into several latent
layers, \textit{i.e.}, scene radiance layer, transmission map layer, and
atmospheric light layer. After that, these three layers are further composed to
the hazy image in a self-supervised manner. Thanks to the unsupervised and
untrained characteristics of YOLY, our method bypasses the conventional
training paradigm of deep models on hazy-clean pairs or a large scale dataset,
thus avoids the labor-intensive data collection and the domain shift issue.
Besides, our method also provides an effective learning-based haze transfer
solution thanks to its layer disentanglement mechanism. Extensive experiments
show the promising performance of our method in image dehazing compared with 14

combination of Lagrangian field measurements and statistical analyses enable us
to create stochastic digital-twins of the guests dynamics, unlocking comfort-
and safety-driven optimizations. Our case study is the Galleria Borghese museum
in Rome (Italy), in which we performed a real-life data acquisition campaign.
  We specifically employ a Lagrangian IoT-based visitor tracking system based
on Raspberry Pi receivers, displaced in fixed positions throughout the museum
rooms, and on portable Bluetooth Low Energy beacons handed over to the
visitors. Thanks to two algorithms: a sliding window-based statistical analysis
and an MLP neural network, we filter the beacons RSSI and accurately
reconstruct visitor trajectories at room-scale. Via a clustering analysis,
hinged on an original Wasserstein-like trajectory-space metric, we analyze the
visitor paths to get behavioral insights, including the most common flow
patterns. On these bases, we build the transition matrix describing, in
probability, the room-scale visitor flows. Such a matrix is the cornerstone of
a stochastic model capable of generating visitor trajectories in silico. We
conclude by employing the simulator to increase the number of daily visitors
while respecting numerous logistic and safety constraints. This is possible
thanks to optimized ticketing and new entrance/exit management.

  Models",,,,,"cs.SE cs.CL cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  Estimating effort based on requirement texts presents many challenges,
especially in obtaining viable features to infer effort. Aiming to explore a
more effective technique for representing textual requirements to infer effort
estimates by analogy, this paper proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of
pre-trained embeddings models. For this, two embeddings approach, context-less
and contextualized models are used. Generic pre-trained models for both
approaches went through a fine-tuning process. The generated models were used
as input in the applied deep learning architecture, with linear output. The
results were very promising, realizing that pre-trained incorporation models
can be used to estimate software effort based only on requirements texts. We
highlight the results obtained to apply the pre-trained BERT model with
fine-tuning in a single project repository, whose value is the Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) is 4.25 and the standard deviation of only 0.17, which represents a
result very positive when compared to similar works. The main advantages of the
proposed estimation method are reliability, the possibility of generalization,
speed, and low computational cost provided by the fine-tuning process, and the
possibility to infer new or existing requirements.

external stress and interacting with random quenched disorder, focusing on
predictability of the plastic deformation process. Upon quasistatically ramping
up the externally applied stress from zero the system responds by exhibiting an
irregular stress--strain curve consisting of a sequence of strain bursts, i.e.,
critical-like dislocation avalanches. The strain bursts are power-law
distributed up to a cutoff scale which increases with the stress level up to a
critical flow stress value. There, the system undergoes a depinning phase
transition and the dislocations start moving indefinitely, i.e., the strain
burst size diverges. Using sample-specific information about the pinning
landscape as well as the initial dislocation configuration as input, we employ
predictive models such as linear regression, simple neural networks and
convolutional neural networks to study the predictability of the simulated
stress--strain curves of individual samples. Our results show that the response
of the system -- including the flow stress value -- can be predicted quite
well, with the correlation coefficient between predicted and actual stress

most exchange-correlation functionals of density-functional theory. Often, the
energy of the HEG is parameterized as a function of its spin density $n$,
leading to the local density approximation (LDA) for inhomogeneous systems.
However, the connection between the electron density and kinetic energy density
of the HEG can be used to generalize the LDA by evaluating it on a weighted
geometric average of the local spin density and the spin density of a HEG that
has the local kinetic energy density of the inhomogeneous system, with a mixing
ratio $x$. This leads to a new family of functionals that we term meta-local
density approximations (meta-LDAs), which are still exact for the HEG, which
are derived only from properties of the HEG, and which form a new rung of
Jacob's ladder of density functionals. The first functional of this ladder, the
local $\tau$ approximation (LTA) of Ernzerhof and Scuseria that corresponds to
$x=1$ is unfortunately not stable enough to be used in self-consistent field
calculations, because it leads to divergent potentials as we show in this work.
However, a geometric averaging of the LDA and LTA densities with smaller values
of $x$ not only leads to numerical stability of the resulting functional, but
also yields more accurate exchange energies in atomic calculations than the
LDA, the LTA, or the tLDA functional ($x=1/4$) of Eich and Hellgren. We choose
$x=0.50$ as it gives the best total energy in self-consistent exchange-only
calculations for the argon atom. Atomization energy benchmarks confirm that the
choice $x=0.50$ also yields improved energetics in combination with correlation
functionals in molecules, almost eliminating the well-known overbinding of the
LDA and reducing its error by two thirds.

the last few years. Unsurprisingly, deception and fraud in such platforms have
also increased, but have not been thoroughly studied to understand what
characteristics can expose such behavior and allow its automatic detection and
blocking. Indeed, crowdfunding platforms are the only ones typically performing
oversight for the campaigns launched in each service. However, they are not
properly incentivized to combat fraud among users and the campaigns they
launch: on the one hand, a platform's revenue is directly proportional to the
number of transactions performed (since the platform charges a fixed amount per
donation); on the other hand, if a platform is transparent with respect to how
much fraud it has, it may discourage potential donors from participating.

campaigns. We analyze data collected from different crowdfunding platforms, and
annotate 700 campaigns as fraud or not. We compute various textual and
image-based features and study their distributions and how they associate with
campaign fraud. Using these attributes, we build machine learning classifiers,
and show that it is possible to automatically classify such fraudulent behavior

applications achieving state-of-the-art results in various domains. However,
most advances have been established empirically, and their theoretical analysis
remains lacking. One major issue is that our current interpretation of neural
networks (NNs) as function approximators is too generic to support in-depth
analysis. In this paper, we remedy this by proposing an alternative
interpretation that identifies NNs as chain graphs (CGs) and feed-forward as an
approximate inference procedure. The CG interpretation specifies the nature of
each NN component within the rich theoretical framework of probabilistic
graphical models, while at the same time remains general enough to cover
real-world NNs with arbitrary depth, multi-branching and varied activations, as
well as common structures including convolution / recurrent layers, residual
block and dropout. We demonstrate with concrete examples that the CG
interpretation can provide novel theoretical support and insights for various
NN techniques, as well as derive new deep learning approaches such as the
concept of partially collapsed feed-forward inference. It is thus a promising
framework that deepens our understanding of neural networks and provides a
coherent theoretical formulation for future deep learning research.

prove a more general version of Nori's theorem, namely, that for all powers $q$
of $p$, if $G$ acts semisimply on ${\mathbf{F}}_q^n$ and $p>n+2$, then
$H^1(G,{\mathbf{F}}_q^n)$ is trivial. We apply these results to refine a
criterion, proved by \c{C}iperiani and Stix, which gives sufficient conditions
for an affirmative answer to a classical question posed by Cassels in the case
of abelian varieties over number fields.

(CPSS) is a challenge. In particular, current approaches relying on human
experts have limited scalability, while automated approaches are often not

This paper introduces a novel pervasive knowledge graph builder that brings
together automation, experts' and crowd-sourced citizens' knowledge. The
knowledge graph grows via automated link predictions using genetic programming
that are validated by humans for improving transparency and calibrating
accuracy. The knowledge graph builder is designed for pervasive devices such as
smartphones and preserves privacy by localizing all computations. The accuracy,
practicality, and usability of the knowledge graph builder is evaluated in a
real-world social experiment that involves a smartphone implementation and a
Smart City application scenario. The proposed knowledge graph building
methodology outperforms the baseline method in terms of accuracy while
demonstrating its efficient calculations on smartphones and the feasibility of
the pervasive human supervision process in terms of high interactions
throughput. These findings promise new opportunities to crowd-source and
operate pervasive reasoning systems for cyber-physical social systems in Smart

Helmholtz equation, while in the time domain, the periodic solutions to a
discretized wave equation are sought, e.g. by simulating for a long time with a
time-harmonic forcing term. Disadvantages of the time-domain method are that
the solutions are affected by temporal discretization errors and that the
spatial discretization cannot be freely chosen, since it is inherited from the
time-domain scheme. In this work we address these issues. Given an indefinite
linear system satisfying certain properties, a matrix recurrence relation is
constructed, such that in the limit the exact discrete solution is obtained. By
iterating a large, finite number of times, an approximate solution is obtained,
similarly as in a time-domain method for the Helmholtz equation. To improve the
convergence, the process is used as a preconditioner for GMRES, and the
time-harmonic forcing term is multiplied by a smooth window function. The
construction is applied to a compact-stencil finite-difference discretization
of the Helmholtz equation, for which previously no time-domain solver was
available. Advantages of the resulting solver are the relative simplicity,
small memory requirement and reasonable computation times.

fabricated using shadow evaporation techniques to reduce dielectric loss
contributions from the superconducting film interfaces. In recent years,
however, sub-micron scale overlap junctions have started to attract attention.
Compared to shadow mask techniques, neither an angle dependent deposition nor
free-standing bridges or overlaps are needed, which are significant limitations
for wafer-scale processing. This comes at the cost of breaking the vacuum
during fabrication, but simplifies integration in multi-layered circuits,
implementation of vastly different junction sizes, and enables fabrication on a
larger scale in an industrially-standardized process. In this work, we
demonstrate the feasibility of a subtractive process for fabrication of overlap
junctions. In an array of test contacts, we find low aging of the average
normal state resistance of only 1.6\% over 6 months. We evaluate the coherence
properties of the junctions by employing them in superconducting transmon
qubits. In time domain experiments, we find that both, the qubit life- and
coherence time of our best device, are on average greater than

$11.27 \times 10^{20}$ protons-on-target in antineutrino mode. The additional
statistics allow several studies to address questions on the source of the
excess. First, we provide two-dimensional plots in visible energy and cosine of
the angle of the outgoing lepton, which can provide valuable input to models
for the event excess. Second, we test whether the excess may arise from photons
that enter the detector from external events or photons exiting the detector
from $\pi^0$ decays in two model independent ways. Beam timing information
shows that almost all of the excess is in time with neutrinos that interact in
the detector. The radius distribution shows that the excess is distributed
throughout the volume, while tighter cuts on the fiducal volume increase the
significance of the excess. We conclude that models of the event excess based
on entering and exiting photons are disfavored.

their synchronization through global performance metrics under external
disturbances. The approach is motivated by fundamental changes in the operation
of power grids, in particular by the substitution of conventional power plants
with new renewable sources of electrical energy. This substitution will
simultaneously increase fluctuations in power generation and reduce the
available mechanical inertia. It is crucial to understand how strongly these
two evolutions will impact grid stability. With very few, mostly numerical
exceptions, earlier works on performance metrics had to rely on unrealistic
assumptions of grid homogeneity. Here we show that a modified spectral
decomposition can tackle that issue in inhomogeneous power grids in cases where
disturbances occur on time scales that are long compared to the intrinsic time
scales of the grid. We find in particular that the magnitude of the transient
excursion generated by disturbances with long characteristic times does not
depend on inertia. For continental-size, high-voltage power grids, this
corresponds to power fluctuations that are correlated on time scales of few
seconds or more. We conclude that power fluctuations arising from new
renewables will not require per se the deployment of additional rotational
inertia. We numerically illustrate our results on the IEEE 118-Bus test case

Provided that the Hamiltonian has $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, it is possible to
find a regime in which the eigenspectrum is completely real. In the case of
static $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric extensions of the simple Su-Schrieffer-Heeger
model, it has been shown that the energies associated with any edge states are
guaranteed to be complex. Moving to a time-dependent system means that
treatment of the Hamiltonian must be done at the effective time-scale of the
modulation itself, allowing for more intricate phases to occur than in the
static case. It has been demonstrated that with particular classes of periodic
driving, achieving a real topological phase at high driving frequency is
possible. In the present paper, we show the details of this process by using a
simple two-step periodic modulation. We obtain a rigorous expression for the
effective Floquet Hamiltonian and compare its symmetries to those of the
original Hamiltonians which comprise the modulation steps. The $\mathcal{PT}$
phase of the effective Hamiltonian is dependent on the modulation frequency as
well as the gain/loss strength. Furthermore, the topologically nontrivial

The $r$-band luminosity declines with projected distance from the Coma core.
The Dragonfly 44 UV luminosity is also consistent with quiescence, with
SFR$<6\times 10^{-4} M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, and no X-rays are detected down to a
sensitivity of $10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$. This rules out a hot corona with a $M >

species (colors) given an underlying evolutionary tree that is assumed to be
unknown. In real-life applications, BMGs are estimated from sequence similarity
data. Measurement noise and approximation errors usually result in empirically
determined graphs that in general violate characteristic properties of BMGs.
The arc modification problems for BMGs aim at correcting such violations and
thus provide a means to improve the initial estimates of best match data. We
show here that the arc deletion, arc completion and arc editing problems for
BMGs are NP-complete and that they can be formulated and solved as integer
linear programs. To this end, we provide a novel characterization of BMGs in
terms of triples (binary trees on three leaves) and a characterization of BMGs
with two colors in terms of forbidden subgraphs.

  Marginals",,,"10.1109/TSP.2021.3090960",,"stat.ML cs.LG eess.SP","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Learning the joint probability of random variables (RVs) is the cornerstone
of statistical signal processing and machine learning. However, direct
nonparametric estimation for high-dimensional joint probability is in general
impossible, due to the curse of dimensionality. Recent work has proposed to
recover the joint probability mass function (PMF) of an arbitrary number of RVs
from three-dimensional marginals, leveraging the algebraic properties of
low-rank tensor decomposition and the (unknown) dependence among the RVs.
Nonetheless, accurately estimating three-dimensional marginals can still be
costly in terms of sample complexity, affecting the performance of this line of
work in practice in the sample-starved regime. Using three-dimensional
marginals also involves challenging tensor decomposition problems whose
tractability is unclear. This work puts forth a new framework for learning the
joint PMF using only pairwise marginals, which naturally enjoys a lower sample
complexity relative to the third-order ones. A coupled nonnegative matrix
factorization (CNMF) framework is developed, and its joint PMF recovery
guarantees under various conditions are analyzed. Our method also features a
Gram--Schmidt (GS)-like algorithm that exhibits competitive runtime
performance. The algorithm is shown to provably recover the joint PMF up to
bounded error in finite iterations, under reasonable conditions. It is also
shown that a recently proposed economical expectation maximization (EM)
algorithm guarantees to improve upon the GS-like algorithm's output, thereby
further lifting up the accuracy and efficiency. Real-data experiments are
employed to showcase the effectiveness.

the Ising model, to below the critical point. This is usually done with
periodic boundary conditions to insure ergodicity breaking in the low
temperature phase. With this arrangement the infinite system is known to remain
permanently out of equilibrium, i.e. there exists a well defined asymptotic
state which is time-invariant but different from the ordered ferromagnetic
state. In this paper we establish the critical nature of this invariant state,
by demonstrating numerically that the quench dynamics with periodic and
antiperiodic boundary conditions are indistinguishable one from the other.
However while the asymptotic state does not coincide with the equilibrium state
for the periodic case, it coincides instead with the equilibrium state of the
antiperiodic case, which in fact is critical. The specific example of the Ising
model is shown to be one instance of a more general phenomenon, since an
analogous picture emerges in the spherical model, where boundary conditions are
kept fixed to periodic, while the breaking or preserving of ergodicity is
managed by imposing the spherical constraint either sharply or smoothly.

weight and cost of a solid part. Currently, most infill structure generation
methods are based on the conventional 2.5-axis printing configuration, which,
although able to satisfy the self-supporting condition on the infills, suffer
from the well-known stair-case effect on the finished surface and the need of
extensive support for overhang features. In this paper, based on the emerging
continuous multi-axis printing configuration, we present a new lattice infill
structure generation algorithm, which is able to achieve both the
self-supporting condition for the infills and the support-free requirement at
the boundary surface of the part. The algorithm critically relies on the use of
three mutually orthogonal geodesic distance fields that are embedded in the
tetrahedral mesh of the solid model. The intersection between the iso-geodesic
distance surfaces of these three geodesic distance fields naturally forms the
desired lattice of infill structure, while the density of the infills can be
conveniently controlled by adjusting the iso-values. The lattice infill pattern
in each curved slicing layer is trimmed to conform to an Eulerian graph so to
generate a continuous printing path, which can effectively reduce the nozzle
retractions during the printing process. In addition, to cater to the
collision-free requirement and to improve the printing efficiency, we also
propose a printing sequence optimization algorithm for determining a
collision-free order of printing of the connected lattice infills, which seeks
to reduce the air-move length of the nozzle. Ample experiments in both computer
simulation and physical printing are performed, and the results give a
preliminary confirmation of the advantages of our methodology.

  Modelling",,,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In many areas of engineering, nonlinear numerical analysis is playing an
increasingly important role in supporting the design and monitoring of
structures. Whilst increasing computer resources have made such formerly
prohibitive analyses possible, certain use cases such as uncertainty
quantification and real time high-precision simulation remain computationally
challenging. This motivates the development of reduced order modelling methods,
which can reduce the computational toll of simulations relying on mechanistic
principles. The majority of existing reduced order modelling techniques involve
projection onto linear bases. Such methods are well established for linear
systems but when considering nonlinear systems their application becomes more
difficult. Targeted schemes for nonlinear systems are available, which involve
the use of multiple linear reduction bases or the enrichment of traditional
bases. These methods are however generally limited to weakly nonlinear systems.
In this work, nonlinear normal modes (NNMs) are demonstrated as a possible
invertible reduction basis for nonlinear systems. The extraction of NNMs from
output only data using machine learning methods is demonstrated and a novel
NNM-based reduced order modelling scheme introduced. The method is demonstrated
on a simulated example of a nonlinear 20 degree-of-freedom (DOF) system.

several linear models that achieve statistically optimal convergence rate under
minimal distributional assumptions. Concretely, we assume our data is drawn
from a $k$-hypercontractive distribution and an $\epsilon$-fraction is
adversarially corrupted. We then describe an estimator that converges to the
optimal least-squares minimizer for the true distribution at a rate
proportional to $\epsilon^{2-2/k}$, when the noise is independent of the

with access to unbounded computation. The rate we achieve is
information-theoretically optimal and thus we resolve the main open question in

  Our key insight is to identify an analytic condition that serves as a
polynomial relaxation of independence of random variables. In particular, we
show that when the moments of the noise and covariates are
negatively-correlated, we obtain the same rate as independent noise. Further,
when the condition is not satisfied, we obtain a rate proportional to
$\epsilon^{2-4/k}$, and again match the information-theoretic lower bound. Our
central technical contribution is to algorithmically exploit independence of
random variables in the ""sum-of-squares"" framework by formulating it as the

in some cases quite counter-intuitively, the existence of bound states with a
singularity of the density pattern at the center, while the states are
physically meaningful because their total norm converges. One model of this
type is based on the 2D Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) which combines the
attractive potential ~ 1/r^2 and the quartic self-repulsive nonlinearity,
induced by the Lee-Huang-Yang effect (quantum fluctuations around the
mean-field state). The GPE demonstrates suppression of the 2D quantum collapse,
driven by the attractive potential, and emergence of a stable ground state
(GS), whose density features an integrable singularity ~1/r^{4/3} at r --> 0.
Modes with embedded angular momentum exist too, and they have their stability
regions. A counter-intuitive peculiarity of the model is that the GS exists
even if the sign of the potential is reversed from attraction to repulsion,
provided that its strength is small enough. This peculiarity finds a relevant
explanation. The other model outlined in the review includes 1D, 2D, and 3D
GPEs, with the septimal (seventh-order), quintic, and cubic self-repulsive
terms, respectively. These equations give rise to stable singular solitons,
which represent the GS for each dimension D, with the density singularity
~1/r^{2/(4-D). Such states may be considered as a result of screening of a
""bare"" delta-functional attractive potential by the respective nonlinearity.

generated GP patterns, dynamic subset selection methods are introduced to the
GP algorithm allowing a regular change of the training sample during evolution.
Four dynamic training-subset selection methods are proposed based on random,

polarized ultrafast optical pulse of a single oscillation at an oblique
incidence. The normal component of the pulse breaks the inversion symmetry of
the system and opens up a dynamical band-gap, due to which a valley-selective
population of the conduction band becomes sensitive to the angle of incident of
the pulse. We show that the magnitude of the valley polarization can be
controlled by the angle of incidence, the amplitude, and the angle of in-plane
polarization of the chiral optical pulse. Subsequently, a sequence of a
circularly polarized pulse followed by a linearly polarized femtosecond-long
pulse can be used to control the valley polarization created by the preceding
pulse. Generally, the linearly polarized pulse depolarizes the system. The
magnitude of such a depolarization depends on the amplitude, and the in-plane
polarization angle of the linearly polarized pulse. Our protocol provides a
favorable platform for applications in valleytronics.

  Modulator on SOI",,,,,"physics.app-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Densely integrated active photonics is key for next generation on-chip
networks for addressing both footprint and energy budget concerns. However, the
weak light-matter interaction in traditional active Silicon optoelectronics
mandates rather sizable device lengths. The ideal active material choice should
avail high index modulation while being easily integrated into Silicon
photonics platforms. Indium tin oxide (ITO) offers such functionalities and has
shown promising modulation capacity recently. Interestingly, the nanometer-thin
unity-strong index modulation of ITO synergistically combines the high
group-index in hybrid plasmonic with nanoscale optical modes. Following this
design paradigm, here, we demonstrate a spectrally broadband, GHz-fast
Mach-Zehnder interferometric modulator, exhibiting a high efficiency signified
by a miniscule VpL of 95 Vum, deploying an one-micrometer compact
electrostatically tunable plasmonic phase-shifter, based on heterogeneously
integrated ITO thin films into silicon photonics. Furthermore we show, that
this device paradigm enables spectrally broadband operation across the entire
telecommunication near infrared C-band. Such sub-wavelength short efficient and
fast modulators monolithically integrated into Silicon platform open up new
possibilities for high-density photonic circuitry, which is critical for high
interconnect density of photonic neural networks or applications in GHz-fast
optical phased-arrays, for example.

  in situ observation in Nice area",,,,,"physics.ao-ph physics.class-ph physics.flu-dyn","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In coastal area, raw wastewater can be directly discharged in the sea during
extreme rain events or failure of the sewage network. The highly urbanized and
touristic area of Nice is directly exposed to this risk. In order to protect
the bathing population and to apply the European regulation (DCE, 2000), Nice
municipality has decided to work on a forecasting tool of transport and fate of
fecal bacterial indicators such as Escherichia Coli. This paper deals with the
first step of this approach which consists in developing a three-dimensional
hydrodynamic simulation coupled with water quality parameters. The model used
is based on Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes's equations for the calculation of
the velocities and water depth (TELEMAC3D), and wave energy balance equation to
account for the wave induced current (TOMAWAC). Two field measurements were
conducted on a real wastewater pollution coming from a sewage pipe located
at-38m depth. The first campaign has validated the vertical diffusion of the
effluent through the water column by the means of variable depth samples and
has stressed the hourly variability of sewage bacterial quality. Due to the
lack of data regarding this last point, the model could not be fully validated.
The second campaign has been designed to overcome this issue and to gather all
the data needed to proceed to the validation of our hydro-ecological
simulation. The comparison of the field measurements and the simulations has
successfully demonstrated the accuracy of the model. But the uncertainty
associated with the laboratory analysis (MPN) are high, making the calibration
and validation processes a complex task. Nevertheless, further research needs
to be done regarding the variability of microbial quality in order to develop
an operational tool allowing the forecast of bacterial pollution. The next step
of this study will be to establish the hourly variation of microbial quality in
the wastewater during dry and raining periods.

  Leonard Lu","PriceAggregator: An Intelligent System for Hotel Price Fetching",,,,,"cs.DC cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  This paper describes the hotel price aggregation system - PriceAggregator,
deployed at Agoda, a global online travel agency for hotels, vacation rentals,
flights and airport transfer. Agoda aggregates non-direct suppliers' hotel
rooms to ensure that Agoda's customers always have the widest selection of
hotels, room types and packages. As of today, Agoda aggregates millions of
hotels. The major challenge is that each supplier only allows Agoda to fetch
for the hotel price with a limited amount of Queries Per Second (QPS). Due to
the sheer volume of Agoda's user search traffic, this limited amount of QPS is
never enough to cover all user searches. Inevitably, many user searches have to
be ignored. Hence, booking lost. To overcome the challenge, we built
PriceAggregator. PriceAggregator intelligently determines when, how and what to
send to the suppliers to fetch for price. In this paper, we not only prove
PriceAggregator is optimal theoretically but also demonstrate that
PriceAggregator performs well in practice. PriceAggregator has been deployed in
Agoda. Extensive online A/B experimentation have shown that PriceAggregator
increases Agoda's bookings significantly.
