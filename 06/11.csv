a modern learning-theoretic take on the classical control problem in which a
learner attempts to optimally control an unknown linear dynamical system with
fully observed state, perturbed by i.i.d. Gaussian noise. It is now understood
that the optimal regret on time horizon $T$ against the optimal control law
scales as $\widetilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{T})$. In this paper, we show that the same
regret rate (against a suitable benchmark) is attainable even in the
considerably more general non-stochastic control model, where the system is
driven by \emph{arbitrary adversarial} noise (Agarwal et al. 2019). In other
words, \emph{stochasticity confers little benefit in online LQR}.
  We attain the optimal $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret when the
dynamics are unknown to the learner, and $\mathrm{poly}(\log T)$ regret when
known, provided that the cost functions are strongly convex (as in LQR). Our
algorithm is based on a novel variant of online Newton step (Hazan et al.
2007), which adapts to the geometry induced by possibly adversarial
disturbances, and our analysis hinges on generic ""policy regret"" bounds for
certain structured losses in the OCO-with-memory framework (Anava et al. 2015).
Moreover, our results accomodate the full generality of the non-stochastic
control setting: adversarially chosen (possibly non-quadratic) costs, partial
state observation, and fully adversarial process and observation noise.

  Experts",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated its ability to solve high
dimensional tasks by leveraging non-linear function approximators. However,
these successes are mostly achieved by 'black-box' policies in simulated
domains. When deploying RL to the real world, several concerns regarding the
use of a 'black-box' policy might be raised. In order to make the learned
policies more transparent, we propose in this paper a policy iteration scheme
that retains a complex function approximator for its internal value predictions
but constrains the policy to have a concise, hierarchical, and human-readable
structure, based on a mixture of interpretable experts. Each expert selects a
primitive action according to a distance to a prototypical state. A key design
decision to keep such experts interpretable is to select the prototypical
states from trajectory data. The main technical contribution of the paper is to
address the challenges introduced by this non-differentiable prototypical state
selection procedure. Experimentally, we show that our proposed algorithm can
learn compelling policies on continuous action deep RL benchmarks, matching the
performance of neural network based policies, but returning policies that are
more amenable to human inspection than neural network or linear-in-feature
policies.

the potential synergies among them, derived satellite products are often
developed for each sensor independently. Differences in retrieved radiances
lead to significant drops in accuracy, which hampers knowledge and information
sharing across sensors. This is particularly harmful for machine learning
algorithms, since gathering new ground truth data to train models for each
sensor is costly and requires experienced manpower. In this work, we propose a
domain adaptation transformation to reduce the statistical differences between
images of two satellite sensors in order to boost the performance of transfer
learning models. The proposed methodology is based on the Cycle Consistent
Generative Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CyCADA) framework that trains the
transformation model in an unpaired manner. In particular, Landsat-8 and
Proba-V satellites, which present different but compatible spatio-spectral
characteristics, are used to illustrate the method. The obtained transformation
significantly reduces differences between the image datasets while preserving
the spatial and spectral information of adapted images, which is hence useful
for any general purpose cross-sensor application. In addition, the training of
the proposed adversarial domain adaptation model can be modified to improve the
performance in a specific remote sensing application, such as cloud detection,
by including a dedicated term in the cost function. Results show that, when the

memory requirement are still not tractable due to the high dimensionality. We
design randomized techniques for different neural network structures to resolve
these challenges. For layers with a reasonable dimension, sketching can be
performed on a regularized least squares subproblem. Otherwise, since the
gradient is a vectorization of the product between two matrices, we apply
sketching on the low-rank approximations of these matrices to compute the most
expensive parts. A distributed version of SENG is also developed for extremely
large-scale applications. Global convergence to stationary points is
established under some mild assumptions and a fast linear convergence is
analyzed under the neural tangent kernel (NTK) case. Extensive experiments on

technique for data-efficient learning, called Dataset Condensation, that learns
to condense large dataset into a small set of informative synthetic samples for
training deep neural networks from scratch. We formulate this goal as a
gradient matching problem between the gradients of deep neural network weights
that are trained on the original and our synthetic data. We rigorously evaluate
its performance in several computer vision benchmarks and demonstrate that it
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. Finally we explore the
use of our method in continual learning and neural architecture search and
report promising gains when limited memory and computations are available.

  Logic Locking",,,,,"cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The outsourcing of the design and manufacturing of integrated circuits (ICs)
in the current horizontal semiconductor integration flow has posed various
security threats due to the presence of untrusted entities, such as
overproduction of ICs, sale of out-of-specification/rejected ICs, and piracy of
Intellectual Properties (IPs). Consequently, logic locking emerged as one of
the prominent design for trust techniques. Unfortunately, these locking
techniques are now inclined to achieve complete Boolean satisfiability (SAT)
resiliency after the seminal work published in [47]. In this paper, we propose
a novel oracle-less attack that is based on the topological analysis of the
locked netlist even though it is SAT-resilient. The attack relies on
identifying and constructing unit functions with a hypothesis key to be
searched in the entire netlist to find its replica. The proposed graph search
algorithm efficiently finds the duplicate functions in the netlist, making it a
self-referencing attack. This proposed attack is extremely efficient and can
determine the secret key within a few minutes. We have also proposed a
countermeasure to make the circuit resilient against this topology-guided
attack to progress towards a secure logic locking technique.

Investigation in the Recommender system. The core contributions of AMEIR are
the three-stage search space and the tailored three-step searching pipeline.
Specifically, AMEIR divides the complete recommendation models into three
stages of behavior modeling, interaction exploration, MLP aggregation, and
introduces a novel search space containing three tailored subspaces that cover
most of the existing methods and thus allow for searching better models. To
find the ideal architecture efficiently and effectively, AMEIR realizes the
one-shot random search in recommendation progressively on the three stages and
assembles the search results as the final outcome. Further analysis reveals
that AMEIR's search space could cover most of the representative recommendation

pose significant challenges to robots. Such tasks require accurate control of
fast movements and precise timing in the presence of imprecise state estimation
of the flying ball and the robot. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise
in learning of complex control tasks from data. However, applying step-based RL
to dynamic tasks on real systems is safety-critical as RL requires exploring
and failing safely for millions of time steps in high-speed regimes. In this
paper, we demonstrate that safe learning of table tennis using model-free
Reinforcement Learning can be achieved by using robot arms driven by pneumatic
artificial muscles (PAMs). Softness and back-drivability properties of PAMs
prevent the system from leaving the safe region of its state space. In this
manner, RL empowers the robot to return and smash real balls with 5 m\s and
12m\s on average to a desired landing point. Our setup allows the agent to
learn this safety-critical task (i) without safety constraints in the
algorithm, (ii) while maximizing the speed of returned balls directly in the
reward function (iii) using a stochastic policy that acts directly on the
low-level controls of the real system and (iv) trains for thousands of trials
(v) from scratch without any prior knowledge. Additionally, we present HYSR, a
practical hybrid sim and real training that avoids playing real balls during
training by randomly replaying recorded ball trajectories in simulation and
applying actions to the real robot. This work is the first to (a) fail-safe
learn of a safety-critical dynamic task using anthropomorphic robot arms, (b)

study the topology (sub-level sets) of the loss landscape of deep ReLU neural
networks with a skip connection and theoretically prove that the skip
connection network inherits the good properties of the two-layer network and
skip connections can help to control the connectedness of the sub-level sets,
such that any local minima worse than the global minima of some two-layer ReLU
network will be very ``shallow"". The ``depth"" of these local minima are at most
$O(m^{(\eta-1)/n})$, where $n$ is the input dimension, $\eta<1$. This provides

advocate imposing an adversarial margin in the input space so as to improve the

that, the adversarial margin, defined as the distance between training

account of both the distance margin in the feature space and the correlation
between the metric and triplet constraints. Next, to enhance robustness to
instance perturbation, we propose to enlarge the adversarial margin through
minimizing a derived novel loss function termed the perturbation loss. The
proposed loss can be viewed as a data-dependent regularizer and easily plugged
into any existing metric learning methods. Finally, we show that the enlarged

selection of galaxies within the sub-sample of the most massive galaxies in the
cluster introduces a $2\,$\% bias in the velocity dispersion estimate when
calculated using a quarter of the most massive cluster members. We also find a
dependence of the velocity dispersion estimate on the aperture radius as a
fraction of $R_{200}$, consistent with previous results.
  The proposed set of unbiased estimators effectively provides a correction of
the velocity dispersion and mass estimates from all those effects in the small
number of cluster members regime. This is tested by applying the new estimators
to a subset of simulated observations. Although for a single galaxy cluster the
statistical and physical effects discussed here are comparable or slightly
smaller than the bias introduced by interlopers, they will be of relevance when
dealing with ensemble properties and scaling relations for large cluster
samples (Abridged).

source is transmitting a sequence of messages (streaming messages) to a
destination through a chain of relays where each hop is subject to packet
erasures. Every source message has to be recovered perfectly at the destination
within a delay constraint of $T$ time slots. In any sliding window of $T+1$
time slots, we assume no more than $N_j$ erasures introduced by the $j$'th hop
channel. The capacity in case of a single relay (a three-node network) was
derived by Fong [1], et al. While the converse derived for the three-node case
can be extended to any number of nodes using a similar technique (analyzing the
case where erasures on other links are consecutive), we demonstrate next that
the achievable scheme, which suggested a clever symbol-wise decode and forward
strategy, can not be straightforwardly extended without a loss in performance.
The coding scheme for the three-node network, which was shown to achieve the
upper bound, was ``state-independent'' (i.e., it does not depend on specific
erasure pattern). While this is a very desirable property, in this paper, we
suggest a ``state-dependent'' (i.e., a scheme which depends on specific erasure
pattern) and show that it achieves the upper bound up to the size of an
additional header. Since, as we show, the size of the header does not depend on
the field size, the gap between the achievable rate and the upper bound
decreases as the field size increases.

empirical data for eight US states: Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois,
Louisiana, New Jersey, New York State, and Texas. Together these states make up
43% of the US population; some of these states appear to have handled their
initial outbreaks well, while others appear to be emerging hotspots. The
evolution of Covid-19 is fairly similar among the states: variations in contact
and recovery rates remain below 5%; however, not surprisingly, variations are
larger in death rate, reinfection rate, stay-at-home effect, and release rate
from sequestration. The results reveal that outbreaks may have been well
underway in several states before first detected and that California might have
seen more than one influx of the pandemic. Our projections based on the current
situation indicate that Covid-19 will become endemic, spreading for more than
two years. Should states fully relax stay-at-home orders, most states may
experience a secondary peak in 2021. If lockdowns had been kept in place, the
number of Covid-19 deaths so far could have been significantly lower in most
states that opened up. Additionally, our model predicts that decreasing contact
rate by 10%, or increasing testing by approximately 15%, or doubling lockdown
compliance (from the current $\sim$ 15% to $\sim$ 30%) will eradicate
infections in the state of Texas within a year. Extending our fits for all of

fact, mathematical structures in a metric-affine geometry are written on the
tangent bundle, which is itself a Lie algebroid; whereas those in generalized
geometries introduced as the basis of double field theories, are written on
Courant algebroids. The Lie, Courant and the higher Courant algebroids used in
exceptional field theories, are all special cases of pre-Leibniz algebroids.
Provided with some additional ingredients, the construction of such geometries
can all be carried over to regular pre-Leibniz algebroids. We define below the
notions of locality structures and locality projectors, which are some such
necessary ingredients. In terms of these structures, $E$-metric-connection
geometries are constructed with (possibly) a minimum number of assumptions.
Certain small gaps in the literature are also filled as we go along. $E$-Koszul
connections, as a generalization of Levi-Civita connections, are going to be
defined and shown to be helpful for some results including a simple
generalization of the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry. We also show
that metric-affine geometries can be constructed in a unique way as special
cases of $E$-metric-connection geometries. Moreover, generalized geometries are
shown to follow as special cases, and various properties of linear
generalized-connections are proven in the present framework. Similarly,
uniqueness of the locality projector in the case of exact Courant algebroids is
proven; a result that explains why the curvature operator, defined with a
projector in the double field theory literature is a necessity.

dimension four. First we show that there always exist smooth energy-minimizing
biharmonic almost complex structures for any almost Hermitian structure on a
compact almost complex four manifold, and all energy-minimizers form a compact
set. Then we study the existence problem when the homotopy class of an almost
complex structure is specified. We obtain existence of energy-minimizing
biharmonic almost complex structures which depends on the topology of $M^4$.
When $M$ is simply-connected and non-spin, then for each homotopy class which
is uniquely determined by its first Chern class, there exists an
energy-minimizing biharmonic almost complex structure. When $M$ is
simply-connected and spin, for each first Chern class, there are exactly two
homotopy classes corresponding to the first Chern class. Given a homotopy class
$[\tau]$ of an almost complex structure, there exists a canonical operation on
the homotopy classes $p$ satisfying $p^2=\text{id}$ such that $p([\tau])$ and
$[\tau]$ have the same first Chern class. We prove that there exists an
energy-minimizing biharmonic almost complex structure in (at least) one of the
two homotopy classes, $[\tau]$ and $p([\tau])$. In general if $M$ is not

  The study of biharmonic almost complex structures should have many

isothermal and adiabatic temperature - pressure dependence of dielectric
constants. The refractive index of optical materials is widely measured in the
literature: it is both temperature and pressure dependent. The argument to
establish the dielectric constant's isentropic temperature dependence is a
thermodynamic one and is thus applicable to all physical models that describe
electron clouds and electronic resonances within materials. The isentropic
slope of the displacement field versus the electric field at all temperatures
is described by an adiabatic dielectric constant in an energy-per-unit mass
system. This slope is shown through the electronic part of the entropy to be
unstable at high temperatures due to the change in the curvature of the
temperature dependence of the dielectric constant. The electronic entropy

which are unacceptable. The dielectric constant's temperature and pressure
dependence is predicted to be only dependent on the specific volume so
isentropes are always positive. A new universal form for the dielectric

exploiting a combination of resonance excitation, asymmetric multi-stability,
and active control. The underlying idea is that, by harmonically exciting a
multi-stable origami at its resonance frequencies, one can induce rapid folding
between its different stable equilibria without the need for using responsive
materials. To this end, we use a bi-stable water-bomb base as an archetypal
example. Via numerical simulation based on a new dynamic model and experimental
testing, we show that the inherent asymmetry of waterbomb bi-stability can
enable dynamic folding with relatively low actuation requirements. For example,
if the water-bomb initially settles at its ""weak"" stable state, one can use a
base excitation to induce the intra-well resonance. As a result, the origami
would fold and remain at the other ""strong"" stable state even if the excitation
does not stop. The origami dynamics starting from the strong state, on the
other hand, is more complicated. The water-bomb origami is prone to show
inter-well oscillation rather than a uni-directional switch due to a nonlinear
relationship between the dynamic folding behavior, asymmetric potential energy
barrier, the difference in resonance frequencies, and excitation amplitude.
Therefore, we develop an active feedback control strategy, which cuts off the
base excitation input at the critical moment to achieve robust and
uni-directional folding from the strong stable state to the weak one. The
results of this study can apply to many different kinds of origami and create a
new approach for rapid and reversible (self-)folding, thus advancing the
application of origami in shape morphing systems, adaptive structures, and
reconfigurable robotics.

give rise to large sweep Mach numbers are studied. High fidelity base flows are
obtained by solving full Navier-Stokes equations with a high-order
shock-fitting method. Using local and global stability theories, an
attachment-line mode is found to be dominant for the laminar-turbulent
transition along the leading edge that agrees well with experimental
observations Gaillard1999. The behavior of this mode explains the reason why
the transition occurs earlier as the sweep Mach number is above 5. Also, this
attachment-line mode is absent if the base flow is calculated with
boundary-layer assumptions, indicating that the influence of inviscid flow
outside the boundary layer can not be ignored as is normally done. It is
clearly demonstrated that the global modes display the features of both
attachment-line modes, as in sweep Hiemenz flow, and cross-flow-like modes
further downstream along the surface. In contrast to incompressible flows, the
mode is shown to be of inviscid nature. Moreover, the leading-edge curvature
has a destabilizing effect on the attachment-line mode for large spanwise wave
numbers but a stabilizing effect for small spanwise wave numbers.

Triaxial deprojection is highly degenerate and our approach illustrates the
resulting difficulties. Fortunately, for massive elliptical galaxies, many
deprojections for a particular line of sight can be discarded, because their
projection along other lines of sight does not resemble elliptical galaxies.
The near-elliptical isophotes of these objects imply near ellipsoidal intrinsic
shapes. In fact, deprojection is unique for densities distributed on
ellipsoidal shells. The constrained non-parametric deprojection method we
present here relaxes this constraint and assumes that the contours of the
luminosity density are boxy/discy ellipsoids with radially varying axis ratios.
With this approach we are able to reconstruct the intrinsic triaxial densities
of our test models, including one drawn from an $N$-body simulation. The method
also allows to compare the relative likelihood of deprojections at different
viewing angles. We show that the viewing orientations of individual galaxies
with nearly ellipsoidal isophotal shapes can be constrained from photometric

stochastic dynamical systems, whose theoretical properties have been well

the inferred latent state is further used for planning at each step. This paper
initiates a rigorous study on the efficiency of particle filtering for
sequential planning, and gives the first particle complexity bounds. Though
errors in past actions may affect the future, we are able to bound the number
of particles needed so that the long-run reward of the policy based on particle
filtering is close to that based on exact inference. In particular, we show
that, in stable systems, polynomially many particles suffice. Key in our proof
is a coupling of the ideal sequence based on the exact planning and the
sequence generated by approximate planning based on particle filtering. We
believe this technique can be useful in other sequential decision-making

focus on commonly observed instabilities in few-sample scenarios. We identify
several factors that cause this instability: the common use of a non-standard
optimization method with biased gradient estimation; the limited applicability
of significant parts of the BERT network for down-stream tasks; and the
prevalent practice of using a pre-determined, and small number of training
iterations. We empirically test the impact of these factors, and identify
alternative practices that resolve the commonly observed instability of the
process. In light of these observations, we re-visit recently proposed methods
to improve few-sample fine-tuning with BERT and re-evaluate their
effectiveness. Generally, we observe the impact of these methods diminishes
significantly with our modified process.

that utilizes iterative gradient descent steps in conjunction with data
reshuffling. Often contrasted with its sibling Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD), RR is usually faster in practice and enjoys significant popularity in
convex and non-convex optimization. The convergence rate of RR has attracted
substantial attention recently and, for strongly convex and smooth functions,
it was shown to converge faster than SGD if 1) the stepsize is small, 2) the
gradients are bounded, and 3) the number of epochs is large. We remove these 3
assumptions, improve the dependence on the condition number from $\kappa^2$ to
$\kappa$ (resp. from $\kappa$ to $\sqrt{\kappa}$) and, in addition, show that
RR has a different type of variance. We argue through theory and experiments
that the new variance type gives an additional justification of the superior
performance of RR. To go beyond strong convexity, we present several results
for non-strongly convex and non-convex objectives. We show that in all cases,
our theory improves upon existing literature. Finally, we prove fast
convergence of the Shuffle-Once (SO) algorithm, which shuffles the data only
once, at the beginning of the optimization process. Our theory for
strongly-convex objectives tightly matches the known lower bounds for both RR
and SO and substantiates the common practical heuristic of shuffling once or
only a few times. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also get new results for
the Incremental Gradient algorithm (IG), which does not shuffle the data at
all.

low- and high-level design decisions that strongly affect the performance of
the resulting agents. Those choices are usually not extensively discussed in
the literature, leading to discrepancy between published descriptions of
algorithms and their implementations. This makes it hard to attribute progress

metals, have been detected in UHJs recently using high resolution transit
spectroscopy. Even though a number of neutral transition metals (e.g., Fe, Ti,
V, Cr) are expected to be strong sources of optical/NUV opacity and, hence,
influence radiative processes in the lower atmospheres of UHJs, only Fe I has
been detected to date. We conduct a systematic search for atomic species in the

performance against realistic full-sky mock temperature maps that include,
besides astrophysical foregrounds, also a fraction of the polarized part of the

across a spherical boundary centred on a supermassive black hole according to
available constraints for accretion disc winds. After sweeping-up a mass equal
to their own, small-scale winds thermalise, powering energy-driven outflows
with dynamics, structure and cooling properties in excellent agreement with
those of analytic wind solutions. Momentum-driven solutions do not easily
occur, because the Compton cooling radius is usually much smaller than the
free-expansion radius of the small-scale winds. Through various convergence
tests, we demonstrate that our implementation yields wind solutions which are
well converged down to the typical resolution achieved in cosmological
simulations. We test our model in hydrodynamic simulations of isolated Milky
Way - mass galaxies. Above a critical AGN luminosity, initially spherical,
small-scale winds power bipolar, energy-driven super-winds that break out of
the galactic nucleus, flowing at speeds $> 1000 \rm \, km \, s^{-1}$ out to
$\sim 10 \, \rm kpc$. These energy-driven outflows result in moderate, but
long-term, reduction in star formation, which becomes more pronounced for
higher AGN luminosities and faster small-scale winds. Suppression of star
formation proceeds through a rapid mode that involves the removal of the
highest-density, nuclear gas and through a slower mode that effectively halts
halo gas accretion. Our new implementation makes it possible to model
AGN-driven winds in a physically meaningful and validated way in simulations of
galaxy evolution, the interstellar medium and black hole accretion flows.

hypothesis that antimatter has a negative gravitational mass and thus falls
upwards on Earth. Astrophysically, the model is similar to but more fundamental
than Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), with the Newtonian gravity $g_{_N}$
towards an isolated point mass boosted by the factor $\nu = 1 + \left( \alpha/x
\right) \tanh \left( \sqrt{x}/\alpha \right)$, where $x \equiv g_{_N}/a_{_0}$
and $a_{_0} = 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$ is the MOND acceleration constant.
We show that $\alpha$ must lie in the range ${0.4-1}$ to acceptably fit galaxy
rotation curves. In the Solar System, this interpolating function implies an
extra Sunwards acceleration of ${\alpha a_{_0}}$. This would cause Saturn to
deviate from Newtonian expectations by ${7000 \left( \alpha/0.4 \right)}$ km
over 15 years, starting from known initial position and velocity on a
near-circular orbit. We demonstrate that this prediction should not be
significantly altered by the postulated dipole haloes of other planets due to
the rather small region in which each planet's gravity dominates over that of
the Sun. The orbit of Saturn should similarly be little affected by a possible
ninth planet in the outer Solar System and by the Galactic gravity causing a
non-spherical distribution of gravitational dipoles several kAU from the Sun.
Radio tracking of the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn yields a ${5\sigma}$
upper limit of 160 metres on deviations from its conventionally calculated
trajectory. These measurements imply a much more stringent upper limit on
$\alpha$ than the minimum required for consistency with rotation curve data.
Therefore, no value of $\alpha$ can simultaneously match all available
constraints, falsifying the gravitational dipole theory in its current form at
extremely high significance.

  We propose a novel quantum version of the classical binary classification

corresponding classical-quantum training data. We discuss learning strategies
for the agnostic and for the realizable case and study their performance to
obtain sample complexity upper bounds. Moreover, we provide sample complexity
lower bounds which show that our upper bounds are essentially tight for pure

study their origins using a cosmological zoom simulation, VINTERGATAN, of a
Milky Way-mass disc galaxy. We find that in connection to the last major merger
at $z\sim 1.5$, cosmological accretion leads to the rapid formation of an
outer, metal-poor, low-[$\alpha$/Fe] gas disc around the inner, metal-rich
galaxy containing the old high-[$\alpha$/Fe] stars. This event leads to a
bimodality in [$\alpha$/Fe] over a range of [Fe/H]. A detailed analysis of how
the galaxy evolves since $z\sim 1$ is presented. We demonstrate the way in
which inside-out growth shapes the radial surface density and metallicity
profile and how radial migration preferentially relocates stars from the inner
to the outer disc. Secular disc heating is found to give rise to increasing
velocity dispersions and scaleheights with stellar age, which together with
disc flaring explains several trends observed in the Milky Way, including
shallower radial [Fe/H]-profiles above the midplane. We show how the galaxy
formation scenario imprints non-trivial mappings between structural
associations (i.e. thick and thin discs), velocity dispersions,
$\alpha$-enhancements, and ages of stars, e.g. the most metal-poor stars in the
low-[$\alpha$/Fe] sequence are found to have a scaleheight comparable to old
high-[$\alpha$/Fe] stars. Finally, we illustrate how at low spatial resolution,
comparable to the thickness of the galaxy, the proposed pathway to distinct

systems involving large numbers of interacting variables, from observational
data, is fundamental to many fields. Known to the statistical physics community
as the inverse problem, it has become accessible in recent years due to real
and simulated 'big' data being generated. Current approaches to the inverse
problem rely on parametric assumptions, physical approximations, e.g.
mean-field theory, and ignoring higher-order interactions which may lead to
biased or incorrect estimates. We bypass these shortcomings using a
cross-disciplinary approach and demonstrate that none of these assumptions and
approximations are necessary: We introduce a universal, model-independent, and
fundamentally unbiased estimator of all-order symmetric interactions, via the
non-parametric framework of Targeted Learning, a subfield of mathematical
statistics. Due to its universality, our definition is readily applicable to
any system at equilibrium with binary and categorical variables, be it magnetic
spins, nodes in a neural network, or protein networks in biology. Our approach
is targeted, not requiring fitting unnecessary parameters. Instead, it expends
all data on estimating interactions, hence substantially increasing accuracy.
We demonstrate the generality of our technique both analytically and
numerically on (i) the 2-dimensional Ising model, (ii) an Ising-like model with
4-point interactions, (iii) the Restricted Boltzmann Machine, and (iv)
simulated individual-level human DNA variants and representative traits. The
latter demonstrates the applicability of this approach to discover epistatic

mergers, provides the necessary physical conditions for the assembly of a
thick, kinematically hot disk populated by high-[$\alpha$/Fe] stars, formed
both in situ and in accreted satellite galaxies. We find that the diversity of
evolutionary tracks followed by the simulated galaxy and its progenitors leads
to very little overlap of the in situ and accreted populations for any given
chemical composition. At a given age, the spread in [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance
ratio results from the diversity of physical conditions in VINTERGATAN and its
satellites, with an enhancement in [$\alpha$/Fe] found in stars formed during
starburst episodes. Later, the cessation of the merger activity promotes the in
situ formation of stars in the low-[$\alpha$/Fe] regime, in a radially
extended, thin and overall kinematically colder disk, thus establishing
chemically bimodal thin and thick disks, in line with observations. We draw

for the onset of star formation at the metal-poor end of the low-[$\alpha$/Fe]

two distinct gas flows. One is enriched by outflows from massive galaxies, but
not the other. While the former feeds the inner galactic region, the latter
fuels an outer gas disk, inclined with respect to the main galactic plane, and
with a significantly poorer chemical content. The first passage of the last
major merger galaxy triggers tidal compression in the outer disk, which
increases the gas density and eventually leads to star formation, at a
metallicity 0.75 dex lower than the inner galaxy. This forms the first stars of
the low-[$\alpha$/Fe] sequence. These in situ stars have halo-like kinematics,
similarly to what is observed in the Milky Way, due to the inclination of the
outer disk which eventually aligns with the inner one via gravitational
torques. We show that this tilting disk scenario is likely to be common in
Milky-Way like galaxies. This process implies that the low-[$\alpha$/Fe]
sequence is populated in situ, simultaneously from two formation channels, in
the inner and the outer galaxy, with distinct metallicities. This contrasts
with purely sequential scenarios for the assembly of the Milky Way disk and
could be tested observationally.

sequence of old stars with a steep rise of [Fe/H] to about +0.3 dex at an age
of ~7 Gyr and a younger sequence with [Fe/H] increasing from -0.3 dex to about
+0.2 dex over the last six Gyr. Furthermore, the trends of several abundance
ratios, [O/Fe], [Na/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and [Ni/Fe], as a function of stellar age
split into two corresponding sequences. The [Y/Mg]-age relation, on the other
hand, shows no offset between the two age sequences and has no significant
dependence on [Fe/H], but the components of a visual binary star, zeta
Reticuli, have a large and puzzling deviation. The split of the age-metallicity
distribution into two sequences may be interpreted as evidence of two episodes
of accretion of gas onto the Galactic disk with a quenching of star formation
in between. Some of the [X/Fe]-age relations support this scenario but other
relations are not so easy to explain, which calls for a deeper study of
systematic errors in the derived abundances as a function of [Fe/H], in

from the semi-light-cone gauge $D=11$ Brink-Schwarz-like superparticle. After
performing a light-cone gauge analysis of the pure spinor BRST cohomology at
ghost number three, we find the linearized equations of motion of $D=11$
supergravity in $D=9$ superspace. In addition, we construct a BRST-closed,
ghost number one vertex operator made out of worldline fields and $D=11$
supergravity superfields, and we run into an inconsistency when constructing a
ghost number zero vertex operator satisfying a standard descent equation. We
then introduce the non-minimal version of the $D=11$ pure spinor superparticle,
in which a composite $b$-ghost can be constructed satisfying $\{Q,b\} = P^{2}$.
However, its complicated expression makes it difficult to check its nilpotency.
We show that introducing an $SO(1,10)$ fermionic vector $\bar{\Sigma}^{a}$
simplifies the form of the $b$-ghost considerably, which allows us to verify
that $\{Q,b\} = P^{2}$ and $\{b,b\}=$ BRST-exact. Using this $b$-ghost we
propose an alternative ghost number zero vertex operator satisfying a standard
descent equation. However, its expression will depend on non-minimal pure
spinor variables in a very complicated fashion. After discussing this
first-quantized approach for $D=11$ supergravity, we move on to discussing the
pure spinor master actions introduced by Cederwall for studying maximally
supersymmetric gauge theories. We show that these actions indeed describe
$D=10$ super-Yang-Mills, $D=10$ super-Born-Infeld and $D=11$ supergravity by
extracting the equations of motion in ordinary superspace for each one of these

equations from triangulating pairs of point observations. Instead, we build on
a direct triangulation of the unknown $3D$ point paired with each of its
observations. We show and validate the high impact of such a simple difference.
The resulting linear system has a simpler structure and the solution through
analytic elimination only requires solving a $6\times 6$ linear system (or $9
\times 9$ when accelerometer bias is included). In addition, all the
observations of every scene point are jointly related, thereby leading to a
less biased and more robust solution. The proposed formulation attains up to
$50$ percent decreased velocity and point reconstruction error compared to the
standard closed-form solver, while it is $4\times$ faster for a $7$-frame set.
Apart from the inherent efficiency, fewer iterations are needed by any further
non-linear refinement thanks to better parameter initialization. In this
context, we provide the analytic Jacobians for a non-linear optimizer that
optionally refines the initial parameters. The superior performance of the
proposed solver is established by quantitative comparisons with the

complex fermions that respect a global U(1) charge symmetry. Such models show
richer behavior than conventional SYK models with Majorana fermions and may be
easier to realize experimentally. We consider two different couplings, namely
tunneling and charge-conserving two-body interactions, and obtain the
corresponding phase diagram using a combination of numerical and analytical

supports revival oscillations, with a ground state close to the thermofield
double, which we argue is dual to a traversable wormhole. We also find two
different gapless non-Fermi liquid phases with tunable charge density which we
interpret as dual to a `large' and `small' charged black hole. The gapped and

numerical simulations of circumstellar matter around a 60Mo runaway star show
that the fast Wolf-Rayet stellar wind is released into a wind-blown cavity
filled with various shocks and discontinuities generated throughout the
precedent evolutionary phases. The resulting fast-wind slow-wind interaction
leads to the formation of spherical shells of swept-up dusty material similar
to those observed in near infrared 24 micron with Spitzer, and which appear to
be co-moving with the runaway massive stars, regardless of their proper motion

therefore, our results explain the absence of detected bow shocks around
Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars such as the high-latitude, very fast-moving objects

radionuclide and injected intravenously. Then, the positrons move through the
tissue and collide with the electrons of the cells in which they interact. As a
result of this interaction, two gamma rays are emitted in the opposite
direction. Gama rays emitted from cancerous tissue that has retained
radioactive glucose are detected through ring-shaped detectors. And the
detected signals are converted into an electrical response. Subsequently, these
responses are sampled with electronic circuits and recorded as histogram matrix
to generate the image set. The gamma rays may not reach the detectors located
in the opposite position in equal time. In PETs having TOF characteristics, it
is aimed to obtain better positioning information by a method based on the
principle of measuring the difference between the reach time of the two photons
to detectors. The measurement of the flight time is carried out with TDC
structures. The measurement of this time difference at the ps level is directly
related to the spatial resolution of the PET system. In this study, 45 nm CMOS
VLSI simulations of TDC structures that have various architectural approaches

the magnitude of their attacks. However, they still have a weak point in their
Command & Control (C&C) system, which is often based on centralized services or
require a complex infrastructure to keep operating without being taken down by
authorities. The recent spread of blockchain technologies may give botnets a
powerful tool to make them very hard to disrupt. Recent research showed how it
is possible to embed C&C messages in Bitcoin transactions, making them nearly
impossible to block. Nevertheless, transactions have a cost and allow very
limited amounts of data to be transmitted. Because of that, only messages from
the botmaster to the bots are sent via Bitcoin, while bots are assumed to
communicate through external channels. Furthermore, for the same reason,
Bitcoin-based messages are sent in clear. In this paper we show how, using
Bitcoin Testnet, it is possible to overcome these limitations and implement a
cost-free, bidirectional, and encrypted C&C channel between the botmaster and
the bots. We propose a communication protocol and analyze its viability in real

the 3D identification and association of large-scale glomeruli on renal
pathology is challenging due to large tissue deformation, missing tissues, and
artifacts from WSI. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-object Association
for Pathology in 3D (Map3D) method for automatically identifying and
associating large-scale cross-sections of 3D objects from routine serial

to not only provide affinity estimation but also offer automatic kidney-wise
quality assurance (QA) for registration; (3) a dual-path association method is
proposed to tackle the large deformation, missing tissues, and artifacts during
tracking. To the best of our knowledge, the Map3D method is the first approach
that enables automatic and large-scale glomerular association across 3D serial

suggests that, at test time, a model trained with Mixup should also be applied

improve both accuracy and calibration of the prediction. Second, we show how
the random perturbation of the new interpretation of Mixup induces multiple

measures the increase in value of an action over previously generated actions.
We validate our approach in both curling, a challenging stochastic domain with

has traditionally been interpreted within the Bloembergen-Purcell-Pound (BPP)
theory of NMR intra-molecular relaxation. The BPP theory draws upon Debye's
theory for describing the rotational diffusion of the $^1$H-$^1$H pair and
predicts a mono-exponential decay of the $^1$H-$^1$H dipole-dipole
autocorrelation function between distinct spin pairs. Using molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations, we show that for both $n$-heptane and water this is not the
case. In particular, the autocorrelation function of individual $^1$H-$^1$H
intra-molecular pairs itself evinces a rich stretched-exponential behavior,
implying a distribution in rotational correlation times. However for the
high-symmetry molecule neopentane, the individual $^1$H-$^1$H intra-molecular
pairs do conform to the BPP description, suggesting an important role of
molecular symmetry in aiding agreement with the BPP model. The inter-molecular
autocorrelation functions for $n$-heptane, water, and neopentane also do not
admit a mono-exponential behavior of individual $^1$H-$^1$H inter-molecular
pairs at distinct initial separations. We suggest expanding the
auto-correlation function in terms of molecular modes, where the molecular
modes do have an exponential relaxation behavior. With care, the resulting
Fredholm integral equation of the first kind can be inverted to recover the
probability distribution of the molecular modes. The advantages and limitations
of this approach are noted.

challenge. High dimensional features and decisions given by deep neural

Current state-of-the-art NN interpretation methods (e.g. Saliency maps,
DeepLIFT, LIME, etc.) focus more on the direct relationship between NN outputs
and inputs rather than the NN structure and operations itself. In current deep
NN operations, there is uncertainty over the exact role played by neurons with
fixed activation functions. In this paper, we achieve partially explainable
learning model by symbolically explaining the role of activation functions (AF)
under a scalable topology. This is carried out by modeling the AFs as adaptive
Gaussian Processes (GP), which sit within a novel scalable NN topology, based
on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Superposition Theorem (KST). In this scalable NN
architecture, the AFs are generated by GP interpolation between control points
and can thus be tuned during the back-propagation procedure via gradient
descent. The control points act as the core enabler to both local and global
adjustability of AF, where the GP interpolation constrains the intrinsic
autocorrelation to avoid over-fitting. We show that there exists a trade-off
between the NN's expressive power and interpretation complexity, under linear
KST topology scaling. To demonstrate this, we perform a case study on a binary
classification dataset of banknote authentication. By quantitatively and
qualitatively investigating the mapping relationship between inputs and output,
our explainable model can provide interpretation over each of the
one-dimensional attributes. These early results suggest that our model has the
potential to act as the final interpretation layer for deep neural networks.

and show that Generic Dijkstra running time grows quadratically with the number
of graph vertices and logarithmically with the number of edge units. We also
discover that the running time of the Generic Dijkstra algorithm in the
function of network utilization is not monotonic, as peak running time is at
approximately 0.25 network utilization. Additionally, we provide an independent
open source implementation of Generic Dijkstra in the Python language. We
confirm the correctness of the algorithm and its superior performance. In
comparison to the Filtered Graphs algorithm, Generic Dijkstra is approximately
2.3 times faster in networks with 25 to 500 nodes, and in 90% of calls its

increasing electron doping, including a superconducting phase, a polaronic
reconstruction of the bandstructure, and structural transitions away from the
2H polytype. The average time between two charge-carrier scattering events -
the scattering lifetime - is a key parameter to describe charge transport and
obtain physical insight in the behavior of such a complex system. In this work,
we combine the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation (based on ab-initio
density functional theory calculations of the electronic bandstructure) with
the experimental results concerning the charge-carrier mobility, in order to
determine the scattering lifetime in gated MoS2 nanolayers as a function of
electron doping and temperature. From these dependencies, we assess the major
sources of charge-carrier scattering upon increasing band filling, and discover
two narrow ranges of electron doping where the scattering lifetime is strongly
suppressed. We indentify the opening of additional intervalley scattering
channels connecting the simultaneously-filled K/K' and Q/Q' valleys in the
Brillouin zone as the source of these reductions, which are triggered by the
two Lifshitz transitions induced by the filling of the high-energy Q/Q' valleys
upon increasing electron doping.

has wide applications in Bayesian statistics and machine learning. While most
gradient free methods have slow convergence rate, the Langevin Monte Carlo
(LMC) that provides fast convergence requires the computation of gradients. In
practice one uses finite-differencing approximations as surrogates, and the
method is expensive in high-dimensions.
  A natural strategy to reduce computational cost in each iteration is to
utilize random gradient approximations, such as random coordinate descent (RCD)
or simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). We show by a
counter-example that blindly applying RCD does not achieve the goal in the most
general setting. The high variance induced by the randomness means a larger
number of iterations are needed, and this balances out the saving in each
iteration.
  We then introduce a new variance reduction approach, termed Randomized
Coordinates Averaging Descent (RCAD), and incorporate it with both overdamped
and underdamped LMC. The methods are termed RCAD-O-LMC and RCAD-U-LMC
respectively. The methods still sit in the random gradient approximation
framework, and thus the computational cost in each iteration is low. However,
by employing RCAD, the variance is reduced, so the methods converge within the
same number of iterations as the classical overdamped and underdamped LMC. This
leads to a computational saving overall.

states can be discerned. Movements that convey affect can also give machines
life-like attributes and help to create a more engaging human-machine

generation that makes use of two movement abstractions: 1) Laban movement
analysis (LMA), and 2) hidden Markov modeling. The LMA provides a systematic
tool for an abstract representation of the kinematic and expressive
characteristics of movements. Given a desired motion path on which a target
emotion is to be overlaid, the proposed approach searches a labeled dataset in
the LMA Effort and Shape space for similar movements to the desired motion path
that convey the target emotion. An HMM abstraction of the identified movements
is obtained and used with the desired motion path to generate a novel movement
that is a modulated version of the desired motion path that conveys the target
emotion. The extent of modulation can be varied, trading-off between kinematic
and affective constraints in the generated movement. The proposed approach is
tested using a full-body movement dataset. The efficacy of the proposed
approach in generating movements with recognizable target emotions is assessed
using a validated automatic recognition model and a user study. The target
emotions were correctly recognized from the generated movements at a rate of
72% using the recognition model. Furthermore, participants in the user study
were able to correctly perceive the target emotions from a sample of generated
movements, although some cases of confusion were also observed.

to choose a single solution by predicting a whole distribution of denoised

denoising problem within the VAE framework by explicitly incorporating imaging
noise models into the decoder. Our approach is fully unsupervised, only
requiring noisy images and a suitable description of the imaging noise
distribution. We show that such a noise model can either be measured,
bootstrapped from noisy data, or co-learned during training. If desired,
consensus predictions can be inferred from a set of DivNoising predictions,
leading to competitive results with other unsupervised methods and, on
occasion, even with the supervised state-of-the-art. DivNoising samples from
the posterior enable a plethora of useful applications. We are (i) showing
denoising results for 13 datasets, (ii) discussing how optical character

century-old Curie-von Schweidler law. Interestingly, the Curie-von Schweidler
law is the motivation behind an unconventional circuit component called
fractional capacitor which due to its power-law property is extensively used in
the modeling of complex dielectric media. Unfortunately, the empirical nature
of the Curie-von Schweidler law plagues the applications of the fractional
capacitor. Here, we derive the Curie-von Schweidler law from a series
combination of a resistor and a capacitor with a linear time-varying
capacitance. This may possibly be its first derivation from physical
principles. However, this required a modification of the classical
charge--voltage relation of a capacitor to account for the time-varying
capacitance. The limitation of the classical charge-voltage relation and its
subsequent modification are justified using appropriate circuit modeling.
Consequently, the parameters of the Curie-von Schweidler law and the fractional
capacitor gain physical interpretation. The Debye response of dielectrics
emerges naturally from the limiting case of the power-law response at short
timescales. The obtained results are validated by matching them with the
published experimental reports.

liquid markedly. In addition, small samples of finite size are known to exhibit
systematic deviations of thermodynamic quantities relative to their bulk
values. Here, we consider the static structure factor of a liquid sample in
slab geometry with open boundaries at the surfaces, which can be thought of as
virtually cutting out the sample from a macroscopically large, homogeneous
fluid. This situation is a relevant limit for the interpretation of
grazing-incidence diffraction experiments at liquid interfaces and films. We
derive an exact, closed expression for the slab structure factor, with the bulk
structure factor as the only input. This shows that such free boundary
conditions cause significant differences between the two structure factors, in
particular at small wavenumbers. An asymptotic analysis of this result yields
the scaling exponent and an accurate, useful approximation of these finite-size
corrections. Furthermore, the open boundaries permit the interpretation of the
slab as an open system, supporting particle exchange with a reservoir. We
relate the slab structure factor to the particle number fluctuations and
discuss conditions under which the subvolume of the slab represents a grand
canonical ensemble with chemical potential $\mu$ and temperature $T$. Thus, the
open slab serves as a test-bed for the small-system thermodynamics in a $\mu T$
reservoir. We provide a microscopically justified and exact result for the size
dependence of the isothermal compressibility. Our findings are corroborated by
simulation data for Lennard-Jones liquids at two representative temperatures.

correlation tracking of supergranules seen in full-disk Doppler images obtained
by the HMI instrument on the NASA SDO satellite. The hourly measurements were
averaged over 34 days to produce daily maps of the latitudinal and longitudinal
velocities. While flows at all latitudes are largely in the form of vortices
with left-handed helicity in the north and right-handed helicity in the south,
there are key distinctions between the low latitude and high latitudes cells.
The low latitude cells have roughly circular shapes, lifetimes of about one
month, rotate nearly rigidly, do not drift in latitude, and do not exhibit any
correlation between longitudinal and latitudinal flow. The high latitude cells
have long extensions that spiral inward toward the poles. They have lifetimes
of several months, rotate differentially with latitude, drift poleward at
speeds approaching 2 m s$^{-1}$, and have a strong correlation between prograde
and equatorward flows. Spherical harmonic spectral analyses confirm that the
flows are dominated by the curl component with RMS velocities of about 12 m
s$^{-1}$ at wavenumber $\ell$ = 10. Fourier transforms in time indicate two
notable components - an $m = \pm\ell$ feature representing the low latitude
component and an $m = \pm1$ feature representing the high latitude component.
The dispersion relation for the low latitude component is well represented by
that derived for Rossby waves. The high latitude component has a constant
temporal frequency for all $\ell$ indicating features advected by differential
rotation at rates representative of the base of the convection zone high
latitudes. The poleward motions of these features further suggest that the high
latitude meridional flow at the base of the convection zone is poleward - not
equatorward.

information effectively in one direction, resulting in a model that can
properly imitate the mechanisms of proton interaction in matter. The study is
centered on predicting dose on a single pencil beam level, avoiding the
averaging effects in treatment plans comprised of thousands pencil beams.
Moreover, such approach allows straightforward integration into today's
treatment planning systems' inverse planning optimization process. The ground
truth training data was prepared with Monte Carlo simulations for both phantom

gantry angles through the patient geometry. For model training, 10'000 Monte
Carlo simulations were prepared for the phantom study, and 4'000 simulations
were prepared for the patient study. The trained LSTM model was able to achieve
a 99.29 % gamma-index pass rate ([0.5 %, 1 mm]) accuracy on the set-aside test

for each pencil beam in 6-23 ms. The average Monte Carlo simulation run-time

for 5 previously unseen lung cancer patients. LSTM networks are well suited for
proton therapy dose calculation tasks. However, further work needs to be
performed to generalize the proposed approach to clinical applications,
primarily to be implemented for various energies, patient sites, and CT

well defined asymptotic probabilities when the expected number of tuples

influx of interest in SGAs, and the non-asymptotic analysis of their bias is by
now well-developed. However, relatively little is known about the optimal
choice of the random approximation (e.g mini-batching) of the gradient in SGAs
as this relies on the analysis of the variance and is problem specific. While
there have been numerous attempts to reduce the variance of SGAs, these
typically exploit a particular structure of the sampled distribution by
requiring a priori knowledge of its density's mode. It is thus unclear how to
adapt such algorithms to non-log-concave settings. In this paper, we construct
a Multi-index Antithetic Stochastic Gradient Algorithm (MASGA) whose
implementation is independent of the structure of the target measure and which
achieves performance on par with Monte Carlo estimators that have access to
unbiased samples from the distribution of interest. In other words, MASGA is an
optimal estimator from the mean square error-computational cost perspective
within the class of Monte Carlo estimators. We prove this fact rigorously for
log-concave settings and verify it numerically for some examples where the
log-concavity assumption is not satisfied.

has drastically increased the collection and exchange of data between sensors

In particular, Smart Meters (SMs) share fine-grained electricity consumption of
households with utility providers that can potentially violate users' privacy
as sensitive information is leaked through the data. In order to enhance
privacy, the electricity consumers can exploit the availability of physical
resources such as a rechargeable battery (RB) to shape their power demand as
dictated by a Privacy-Cost Management Unit (PCMU). In this paper, we present a
novel method to learn the PCMU policy using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL).
We adopt the mutual information (MI) between the user's demand load and the
masked load seen by the power grid as a reliable and general privacy measure.
Unlike previous studies, we model the whole temporal correlation in the data to
learn the MI in its general form and use a neural network to estimate the
MI-based reward signal to guide the PCMU learning process. This approach is
combined with a model-free DRL algorithm known as the Deep Double Q-Learning
(DDQL) method. The performance of the complete DDQL-MI algorithm is assessed
empirically using an actual SMs dataset and compared with simpler privacy
measures. Our results show significant improvements over state-of-the-art
privacy-aware demand shaping methods.

disorders as brain disorders. In the present study we investigate how common a
neuroreductionist inclination is among highly educated people. In particular,
we shed light on implicit presuppositions of mental disorders little is known
about in the public, exemplified here by the case of Body Integrity Dysphoria
(BID) that is considered a mental disorder for the first time in ICD-11.
  Methods. Identically graphed, simulated data of mind-brain correlations were
shown in three contexts with presumably different presumptions about causality.
738 highly-educated laymen rated plausibility of causality attribution from
brain to mind and from mind to brain for correlations between brain structural
properties and mental phenomena. We contrasted participants' plausibility
ratings of causality in the contexts of commonly perceived brain-lesion induced
behavior (aphasia), behavior-induced training effects (piano playing), and a
newly described mental disorder (BID).
  Results. The findings reveal the expected context-dependent modulation of
causality attributions in the contexts of aphasia and piano playing.
Furthermore, we observed a significant tendency to more readily attribute
causal inference from brain to mind than vice versa with respect to BID.
  Conclusion. In some contexts, exemplified here by aphasia and piano playing,
unidirectional causality attributions may be justified. However, with respect
to BID, we critically discuss presumably unjustified neuroreductionist
inclinations under causal uncertainty. Finally, we emphasize the need for a
presupposition-free approach in psychiatry.

Peter Pan discs to be primordial. We find that we require low transport
($\alpha\sim10^{-4}$), extremely low external photoevaporation
($\leq10^{-9}{\rm M_{\odot}/yr}$), and relatively high disc masses ($>0.25M_*$)
to produce discs with ages and accretion rates consistent with Peter Pan discs.
Higher transport ($\alpha = 10^{-3}$) results in disc lifetimes that are too
short and even lower transport ($\alpha = 10^{-5}$) leads to accretion rates
smaller than those observed. The required external photoevaporation rates are
so low that primordial Peter Pan discs will have formed in rare environments on
the periphery of low-mass star-forming regions, or deeply embedded, and as such
have never subsequently been exposed to higher amounts of UV radiation. Given
that such an external photoevaporation scenario is rare, the required disc
parameters and accretion properties may reflect the initial conditions and
accretion rates of a much larger fraction of the discs around low-mass stars.

machine learning research, however, synthesizing dance movements from music is
a challenging problem. Recently, researchers synthesize human motion sequences
through autoregressive models like recurrent neural network (RNN). Such an
approach often generates short sequences due to an accumulation of prediction
errors that are fed back into the neural network. This problem becomes even
more severe in the long motion sequence generation. Besides, the consistency
between dance and music in terms of style, rhythm and beat is yet to be taken
into account during modeling. In this paper, we formalize the music-conditioned
dance generation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem and devise a novel
seq2seq architecture to efficiently process long sequences of music features
and capture the fine-grained correspondence between music and dance.
Furthermore, we propose a novel curriculum learning strategy to alleviate error
accumulation of autoregressive models in long motion sequence generation, which
gently changes the training process from a fully guided teacher-forcing scheme
using the previous ground-truth movements, towards a less guided autoregressive
scheme mostly using the generated movements instead. Extensive experiments show
that our approach significantly outperforms the existing state-of-the-arts on

manner for reinforcement learning with continuous state and action spaces under

sample complexity for estimating $\epsilon$-optimal $Q$-function is known to
scale as ${\Omega}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{d_1+d_2 +2}})$ per classical
non-parametric learning theory, where $d_1$ and $d_2$ denote the dimensions of
the state and action spaces respectively. The $Q$-function, when viewed as a
kernel, induces a Hilbert-Schmidt operator and hence possesses square-summable
spectrum. This motivates us to consider a parametric class of $Q$-functions
parameterized by its ""rank"" $r$, which contains all Lipschitz $Q$-functions as
$r \to \infty$. As our key contribution, we develop a simple, iterative
learning algorithm that finds $\epsilon$-optimal $Q$-function with sample
complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{\max(d_1, d_2)+2}})$ when the
optimal $Q$-function has low rank $r$ and the discounting factor $\gamma$ is

might be of interest in its own right. Empirical results on several stochastic

While these methods enjoy some theoretical appeal in terms of consistency and

propose a conformal inference-based approach that can produce reliable interval

experiments with perfect compliance, the intervals have guaranteed average
coverage in finite samples regardless of the unknown data generating mechanism.
For randomized experiments with ignorable compliance and general observational
studies obeying the strong ignorability assumption, the intervals satisfy a
doubly robust property which states the following: the average coverage is
approximately controlled if either the propensity score or the conditional
quantiles of potential outcomes can be estimated accurately. Numerical studies
on both synthetic and real datasets empirically demonstrate that existing
methods suffer from a significant coverage deficit even in simple models. In

typically one year, is characterized by observing frequency of claims together
with the associated claims severities. The collective risk model describes this
portfolio as a random sum of the aggregation of the claim amounts. In the
classical framework, for simplicity, the claim frequency and claim severities
are assumed to be mutually independent. However, there is a growing interest in
relaxing this independence assumption which is more realistic and useful for
the practical insurance ratemaking. While the common thread has been capturing
the dependence between frequency and aggregate severity within a single period,
the work of Oh et al. (2020a) provides an interesting extension to the addition
of capturing dependence among individual severities. In this paper, we extend
these works within a framework where we have a portfolio of microlevel
frequencies and severities for multiple years. This allows us to develop a
factor copula model framework that captures various types of dependence between
claim frequencies and claim severities over multiple years. It is therefore a
clear extension of earlier works on one-year dependent frequency-severity
models and on random effects model for capturing serial dependence of claims.
We focus on the results using a family of elliptical copulas to model the
dependence. The paper further describes how to calibrate the proposed model
using illustrative claims data arising from a Singapore insurance company. The
estimated results provide strong evidence of all forms of dependencies captured

was in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, USA. We built an eclipse observation system,

identical telescopes to improve a signal to noise ratio. The observation was
conducted with 4 wavelengths and 3 linear polarization directions according to
the planned schedule in a limited total eclipse time of about 140 seconds.
Polarization information of corona from the data was successfully obtained but
we were not able to obtain global information of coronal electron temperature

system and a strong emission from the prominence located in the western limb.

by Berry and Tabor in their seminal paper from 1977. We focus entirely on the
case that the (ratios of) frequencies $\omega_1,\omega_2,\ldots,\omega_d$

$d+1$, allowing us to use tools from algebraic number theory. This special case
was studied by Dyson, Bleher, Bleher-Homma-Ji-Roeder-Shen, and others. Under a
suitable rescaling, we prove that the distribution of spacings behaves
asymptotically quasiperiodically in $\log E$. We also prove that the
distribution of ratios of neighboring spacings behaves asymptotically
quasiperiodically in $\log E$. The same holds for the distribution of finite

in the presence of a quenched Gaussian random potential. The main variable for
the field theory is the density fluctuation which measures the difference
between the local density and its average value. The average density is
spatially inhomogeneous for given realization of the random potential. It
becomes uniform only after averaged over the disorder configurations. We
develop the diagrammatic perturbation theory for the density correlation
function and calculate the zero-frequency component of the response function
exactly by summing all the diagrams contributing to it. From this exact result
and the fluctuation dissipation relation, which holds in an equilibrium
dynamics, we find that the connected density correlation function always decays
to zero in the long-time limit for all values of disorder strength implying
that the system always remains ergodic. This nonperturbative calculation relies
on the simple diagrammatic structure of the present field theoretical scheme.
We compare in detail our diagrammatic perturbation theory with the one used in
a recent paper [B.\ Kim, M.\ Fuchs and V.\ Krakoviack, J.\ Stat.\ Mech.\ (2020)

of the theory of canonical transformations, we find that it can be described by
a closed-loop feedback problem. Secondly, for a quantum physical system, if one
realizes that the Heisenberg commutation relations themselves can be thought of
as constraints in a non-commutative space, then the momentum must be dependent
on the position for any generic wave function. This implies the existence of a

synchronization such as splay states and cluster synchronization. Here we
analyze dynamical states that display a continuum of seemingly independent
splay clusters. Each splay cluster is a block splay state consisting of
sub-clusters of fully synchronized nodes with uniform amplitudes. Phases of
nodes within a splay cluster are equally spaced, but nodes in different splay
clusters have an arbitrary phase difference that can be fixed or evolve
linearly in time. Such coexisting splay clusters form a decoupled state in that
the dynamical equations become effectively decoupled between oscillators that
can be physically coupled. We provide the conditions that allow the existence
of particular decoupled states by using the eigendecomposition of the coupling
matrix. Additionally, we provide an algorithm to search for admissible
decoupled states using the external equitable partition and orbital partition
considerations combined with symmetry groupoid formalism. Unlike previous
studies, our approach is applicable when existence does not follow from
symmetries alone and also illustrates the differences between adjacency and
Laplacian coupling. We show that the decoupled state can be linearly stable for
a substantial range of parameters using a simple eight-node cube network and
its modifications as an example. We also demonstrate how the linear stability
analysis of decoupled states can be simplified by taking into account the
symmetries of the Jacobian matrix. Some network structures can support multiple
decoupled patterns. To illustrate that, we show the variety of qualitatively
different decoupled states that can arise on two-dimensional square and
hexagonal lattices.

Bellman residual minimization with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is more

state, two independent samples for the next state are required, but often only
one sample is available. Recently, the authors of [Zhu et al, 2020] introduced
the borrowing from the future (BFF) algorithm to address this issue for the

to approximately re-sample the next state when the underlying dynamics of the

action-value function based model-free control. We prove that BFF is close to
unbiased SGD when the underlying dynamics vary slowly with respect to actions.

them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as
of May 9, 2020) with their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of
COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies. (1) We show that
COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute
to improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19
CT. (2) We collected CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to
distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza, or normal or other types of
diseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from
non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4)
From text-mined captions and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms
and clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those of influenza to demonstrate the
disease differences in the scientific publications. We believe that our work is
complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical
image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset, code, and DL models are

accretion continuum. Increased central luminosity will enhance line emissivity
in more distant clouds, leading to increased average distance of the
broad-line-emitting clouds and decreased averaged line width, known as the
broad-line region (BLR) ""breathing"". However, different lines breathe
differently, and some high-ionization lines, such as C IV, can even show
""anti-breathing"" where the line broadens when luminosity increases. Using
multi-year photometric and spectroscopic monitoring data from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping project, we quantify the breathing effect
($\Delta$log W=$\alpha\Delta$log L) of broad H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, Mg II, C IV,
and C III] for statistical quasar samples over $z\approx 0.1-2.5$. We found
that H$\beta$ displays the most consistent normal breathing expected from the
virial relation ($\alpha\sim-0.25$), Mg II and H$\alpha$ on average show no
breathing ($\alpha\sim 0$), and C IV (and similarly C III] and Si IV mostly
shows anti-breathing ($\alpha>0$). The anti-breathing of C IV can be well
understood by the presence of a non-varying core component in addition to a
reverberating broad-base component, consistent with earlier findings. The
deviation from canonical breathing introduces extra scatter (a
luminosity-dependent bias) in single-epoch virial BH mass estimates due to
intrinsic quasar variability, which underlies the long argued caveats of C IV
single-epoch masses. Using the line dispersion instead of FWHM leads to less,
albeit still substantial, deviations from canonical breathing in most cases.
Our results strengthen the need for reverberation mapping to provide reliable
quasar BH masses, and quantify the level of variability-induced bias in
single-epoch BH masses based on various lines.

gathered a large collection of successful applications, and theoretical
guarantees for model recovery are known only whenever optimization is carried

characterizes the surprising phenomenon that dictionary recovery can be
facilitated by searching over the space of larger over-realized models. This
observation is general and independent of the specific dictionary learning
algorithm used. We thoroughly demonstrate this observation in practice and
provide an analysis of this phenomenon by tying recovery measures to
generalization bounds. In particular, we show that model recovery can be
upper-bounded by the empirical risk, a model-dependent quantity and the
generalization gap, reflecting our empirical findings. We further show that an
efficient and provably correct distillation approach can be employed to recover
the correct atoms from the over-realized model. As a result, our meta-algorithm
provides dictionary estimates with consistently better recovery of the
ground-truth model.

representations merely based on the attention mechanism. GRAPH-BERT provides an
opportunity for transferring pre-trained models and learned graph
representations across different tasks within the same graph dataset. In this
paper, we will further investigate the graph-to-graph transfer of a universal
GRAPH-BERT for graph representation learning across different graph datasets,
and our proposed model is also referred to as the G5 for simplicity. Many
challenges exist in learning G5 to adapt the distinct input and output
configurations for each graph data source, as well as the information
distributions differences. G5 introduces a pluggable model architecture: (a)
each data source will be pre-processed with a unique input representation
learning component; (b) each output application task will also have a specific
functional component; and (c) all such diverse input and output components will
all be conjuncted with a universal GRAPH-BERT core component via an input size
unification layer and an output representation fusion layer, respectively.
  The G5 model removes the last obstacle for cross-graph representation
learning and transfer. For the graph sources with very sparse training data,
the G5 model pre-trained on other graphs can still be utilized for
representation learning with necessary fine-tuning. What's more, the
architecture of G5 also allows us to learn a supervised functional classifier
for data sources without any training data at all. Such a problem is also named
as the Apocalypse Learning task in this paper. Two different label reasoning
strategies, i.e., Cross-Source Classification Consistency Maximization (CCCM)
and Cross-Source Dynamic Routing (CDR), are introduced in this paper to address
the problem.

proposes to defend ASV systems against adversarial attacks with a separate

effective on detecting adversarial samples. To investigate detector robustness
in a realistic defense scenario where unseen attack settings may exist, we
analyze various kinds of unseen attack settings' impact and observe that the
detector is robust (6.27\% EER_{det} degradation in the worst case) against
unseen substitute ASV systems, but it has weak robustness (50.37\% EER_{det}

robustness against unseen perturbation methods shows a direction for developing
stronger countermeasures.

involving successive eruptions of two filaments on 2015 November 15-16, which
presented abundant sympathetic characteristics. The two filaments (F1 and F2)
were separated by a narrow region of negative polarity, and F1 firstly erupted,
producing a two-ribbon flare. When the outward-spreading ribbon produced by F1
approached stable F2, a weak brightening was observed to the south of F2 and
then spread northward, inward approaching F2. Behind this inward-spreading
brightening, a dimming region characterized by a plasma density reduction of
30% was extending. NLFFF extrapolations with a time sequence reveal that fields
above pre-eruption F1 and F2 constituted a quadrupolar magnetic system with a
possible null point. Moreover, the null point kept moving towards F2 and
descending within the following hours.We infer that the rising F1 pushed its
overlying fields towards the fields above stable F2 and caused successive
external reconnection between the overlying fields. From outside to inside
(lower and lower in height), the fields above pre-eruption F2 were gradually
involved in the reconnection, manifesting as the inward-spreading brightening
and extending dimming on the south side of F2. Furthermore, the external
reconnection could reconfigure the overlying fields of F2 by transporting
magnetic flux from its west part to the east part, which is further verified by
the subsequent partial eruption of F2. We propose an integrated evidence chain
to demonstrate the critical roles of external magnetic reconnection and the
resultant reconfiguration of overlying fields on the sympathetic eruptions of
two filaments.

continues to change its internal models and behaviors to minimize the
difference in predicting sensory input, it is not enough to model sensorimotor
visual perception. An embodiment of the system is the key to achieving
sensorimotor visual perception. The proposed embodied system is configured by a
body and memory. The body has an ocular motor system controlling the direction
of eye gaze, which means that the eye can only observe a small focused area of
the environment. The memory is not photographic, but is a generative model
implemented with a variational autoencoder that contains prior knowledge about
the environment, and that knowledge is classified. By limiting body and memory
abilities and operating according to the FEP, the embodied system repeatedly
takes action to obtain the next sensory input based on various potentials of
future sensory inputs. In the evaluation, the inference of the environment was
represented as an approximate posterior distribution of characters (0 - 9). As
the number of repetitions increased, the attention area moved continuously,
gradually reducing the uncertainty of characters. Finally, the probability of
the correct character became the highest among the characters. Changing the
initial attention position provides a different final distribution, suggesting
that the proposed system has a confirmation bias.

To face the
challenges of exploration, we consider a reward-free RL framework that
completely separates exploration from exploitation and brings new challenges
for exploration algorithms. In the exploration phase, the agent learns an
exploratory policy by interacting with a reward-free environment and collects a
dataset of transitions by executing the policy. In the planning phase, the
agent computes a good policy for any reward function based on the dataset
without further interacting with the environment. This framework is suitable
for the meta RL setting where there are many reward functions of interest. In
the exploration phase, we propose to maximize the Renyi entropy over the
state-action space and justify this objective theoretically. The success of
using Renyi entropy as the objective results from its encouragement to explore
the hard-to-reach state-actions. We further deduce a policy gradient
formulation for this objective and design a practical exploration algorithm
that can deal with complex environments. In the planning phase, we solve for
good policies given arbitrary reward functions using a batch RL algorithm.
Empirically, we show that our exploration algorithm is effective and sample

low-frequency information in the missing regions has a substantial influence on
the quality of the restored image. However, existing inpainting methods usually
fail to consider both high-frequency and low-frequency information
simultaneously. To solve this problem, this paper proposes edge information and
mask shrinking based image inpainting approach, which consists of two models.
The first model is an edge generation model used to generate complete edge
information from the damaged image, and the second model is an image completion
model used to fix the missing regions with the generated edge information and
the valid contents of the damaged image. The mask shrinking strategy is
employed in the image completion model to track the areas to be repaired. The
proposed approach is evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively on the dataset
Places2. The result shows our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

searching for a geometric transformation. Recent works leverage the power of
deep learning for registering a pair of point sets. However, unfortunately,
deep learning models often require a large number of ground truth labels for
training. Moreover, for a pair of source and target point sets, existing deep
learning mechanisms require explicitly designed encoders to extract both deep
spatial features from unstructured point clouds and their spatial correlation
representation, which is further fed to a decoder to regress the desired
geometric transformation for point set alignment. To further enhance deep
learning models for point set registration, this paper proposes Deep-3DAligner,
a novel unsupervised registration framework based on a newly introduced deep
Spatial Correlation Representation (SCR) feature. The SCR feature describes the
geometric essence of the spatial correlation between source and target point
sets in an encoding-free manner. More specifically, our method starts with
optimizing a randomly initialized latent SCR feature, which is then decoded to
a geometric transformation (i.e., rotation and translation) to align source and
target point sets. Our Deep-3DAligner jointly updates the SCR feature and
weights of the transformation decoder towards the minimization of an
unsupervised alignment loss. We conducted experiments on the ModelNet40
datasets to validate the performance of our unsupervised Deep-3DAligner for
point set registration. The results demonstrated that, even without ground
truth and any assumption of a direct correspondence between source and target
point sets for training, our proposed approach achieved comparative performance
compared to most recent supervised state-of-the-art approaches.

indicate the degree of the antibody response. Based on our previous study, we
designed and synthesized two groups of small molecules, called haptens, with
varied hydrophobicities to investigate the relationship between properties of
small molecules and antibody response in term of titer and affinity. We found
that the magnitude of the antibody response is positively correlated with the
degree of molecular hydrophobicity and related chemical descriptors. This study
provides insight into the immunological characteristics of small molecules
themselves and useful clues to produce high quality antibodies against small
molecules.

  Compute-efficient machine learning is the use of compressed network

augments the first pillar's impact through the use of techniques that
distribute computational loads across idle capacity on devices. This is paired
with the third pillar of data sovereignty to ensure the privacy of user data

$\sim 4\times 10^6 M_{\odot}$ in the Milky Way and stars are orbiting around
it. In May 2018, one of the nearest stars to Sgr A* named S0-2/S2 experienced
the pericenter passage. The redshift of photons from S0-2 had varied from
$4000\>{\rm km\>s^{-1}}$ to $-2000\>{\rm km\>s^{-1}}$ during the pericenter

steep variation of the redshift gives a strong constraint on a dark mass
distribution inside the orbit of S0-2. By applying a simple $\chi^2$ analysis
to the observed redshift, we can easily distinguish between the two models, the
point mass model and the point mass plus an extended mass model without the
best-fitting parameter search. Our redshift data during the pericenter passage
in 2018 with Subaru/IRCS bound the amount of the extended mass inside the orbit
of S0-2 less than $0.5\,\%$ ($\sim 2 \times 10^4 M_\odot$) of the mass of Sgr

works with the best-fitting parameter search to the motion of S0-2 including
the effect of the extended mass. We consider both the power-law and the Plummer

similar distributions of the stellar mass, the specific star formation rate,
and the ratio of $L_{\rm IR}$ to $L_{\rm UV}$ to those without AGNs. After
having performed a two-dimensional surface brightness modeling for those cSFGs

point-like X-ray AGN on measuring the structural parameters of its host galaxy,

environment between cSFGs with and without AGNs suggests that their AGN
activities are potentially triggered by internal secular processes, such as
gravitational instabilities or/and dynamical friction.

To this end, we find an upper bound for the maximum growth rate of any
$n$-dimensional volume of the phase space by the evolution operator associated
to the Navier-Stokes equations. As explained by Constantin et al. (J. Fluid
Mech., 1985), The value of $n$ for which this maximum is zero is an upper bound
for the attractor dimension. In order to use this property in the more precise
case of a 3D periodical domain, we are led to calculate the distribution of $n$
modes which minimises the total (viscous and Joule) dissipation. This set of
modes turns out to exhibit most of the well known properties of MHD turbulence,
previously obtained by heuristic considerations such as the existence of the
Joule cone under strong magnetic field. The sought estimates for the small
scales and attractor dimension are then obtained under no physical assumption
as functions of the Hartmann and the Reynolds numbers and match the Hartmann
number dependency of heuristic results. A necessary condition for the flow to
be tridimensional and anisotropic (as opposed to purely two-dimensional) is

the sliced-averaged neutral hydrogen fraction from the given 21-cm map. The

shown that deep learning analyzing method has a large potential to efficiently
reconstruct the EoR history from the 21-cm tomography surveys in future.

improve portfolio diversification in a few of the analyzed windows from our

However, we cannot confirm this pattern as the normal case. By including
cryptocurrencies in their portfolios, investors predominantly cannot reach a
significantly higher efficient frontier. These results also hold, if the
non-normality of cryptocurrency returns is considered. Moreover, we control for
changes of the results, if transaction costs/illiquidities on the

mathematically formulated in several different ways. Here we tackle the problem
in the case of a continuous distribution using mathematical tools from
statistical physics. To this extent, we introduce a novel kinetic model of
growth which highlights the role of microscopic transitions in determining a
variety of equilibrium distributions. At variance with other approaches, the
mesoscopic description in terms of elementary interactions allows to design
precise microscopic feedback control therapies, able to influence the natural
tumor growth and to mitigate the risk factors involved in big sized tumors. We
further show that under a suitable scaling both the free and controlled growth
models correspond to Fokker--Planck type equations for the growth distribution
with variable coefficients of diffusion and drift, whose steady solutions in
the free case are given by a class of generalized Gamma densities which can be
characterized by fat tails. In this scaling the feedback control produces an
explicit modification of the drift operator, which is shown to strongly modify
the emerging distribution for the tumor size. In particular, the size
distributions in presence of therapies manifest slim tails in all growth
models, which corresponds to a marked mitigation of the risk factors. Numerical
results confirming the theoretical analysis are also presented.

of binary black holes with eccentric orbits and embed them in samples of
simulated noise of design-sensitivity Advanced LIGO detectors. We studied the
network overlaps and point estimates of central moments of signal waveforms
recovered by BayesWave as a function of $e$, the eccentricity of the binary at
8 Hz orbital frequency. BayesWave recovers signals of near-circular
($e\lesssim0.2$) and highly eccentric ($e\gtrsim0.7$) binaries with network
overlaps similar to that of circular ($e=0$) ones, however it produces lower
network overlaps for binaries with $e\in[0.2,0.7]$. Estimation errors on
central frequencies and bandwidths (measured relative to bandwidths) are nearly
independent from $e$, while estimation errors on central times and durations
(measured relative to durations) increase and decrease with $e$ above
$e\gtrsim0.5$, respectively. We also tested how BayesWave performs when
reconstructions are carried out using generalized wavelets with linear
frequency evolution (chirplets) instead of sine-Gaussian wavelets. We have
found that network overlaps improve by $\sim 10-20$ percent when chirplets are
used, and the improvement is the highest at low ($e<0.5$) eccentricities. There

crucially contribute to a thorough understanding of the physics at play, be it
for the critical behavior if that is governed by a zero-temperature fixed point
or for uncovering properties of the ordered phase. While ground states can in
principle be computed using general-purpose optimization algorithms such as
simulated annealing or genetic algorithms, it is often much more efficient to
use exact or approximate techniques specifically tailored to the problem at
hand. For certain systems with discrete degrees of freedom such as the
random-field Ising model, there are polynomial-time methods to compute exact
ground states. But even as the number of states increases beyond two as in the
random-field Potts model, the problem becomes NP hard and one cannot hope to
find exact ground states for relevant system sizes. Here, we compare a number
of approximate techniques for this problem and evaluate their performance.

maintaining the habitability of terrestrial planets. Additional constraints on

issue in many scientific disciplines. In the 2D case, the classical approach is
to compute the linear correlation coefficient from a scatterplot. This method,
however, implicitly assumes a linear relationship between the variables. Such
an assumption is not always correct. With the use of the partial correlation
coefficients, an extension to the multidimensional case is possible. However,
the problem of the assumed mutual linear relationship of the variables remains.
A relatively recent approach that makes it possible to avoid this problem is
the modeling of the joint probability density function (PDF) of the data with
copulas. These are functions that contain all the information on the
relationship between two random variables. Although in principle this approach
also can work with multidimensional data, theoretical as well computational
difficulties often limit its use to the 2D case. In this paper, we consider an
approach based on so-called vine copulas, which overcomes this limitation and
at the same time is amenable to a theoretical treatment and feasible from the
computational point of view. We applied this method to published data on the
near-IR and far-IR luminosities and atomic and molecular masses of the Herschel
reference sample, a volume-limited sample in the nearby Universe. We determined
the relationship of the luminosities and gas masses and show that the far-IR
luminosity can be considered as the key parameter relating the other three
quantities. Once removed from the 4D relation, the residual relation among the
latter is negligible. This may be interpreted as the correlation between the
gas masses and near-IR luminosity being driven by the far-IR luminosity, likely
by the star formation activity of the galaxy.

NPC, boundary ambiguity, as well as the limited available annotated samples
conspire NPC segmentation in MRI towards a challenging task. In this paper, we
propose a Dense SegU-net (DSU-net) framework for automatic NPC segmentation in
MRI. Our contribution is threefold. First, different from the traditional
decoder in U-net using upconvolution for upsamling, we argue that the
restoration from low resolution features to high resolution output should be
capable of preserving information significant for precise boundary
localization. Hence, we use unpooling to unsample and propose SegU-net. Second,
to combat the potential vanishing-gradient problem, we introduce dense blocks
which can facilitate feature propagation and reuse. Third, using only cross
entropy (CE) as loss function may bring about troubles such as miss-prediction,
therefore we propose to use a loss function comprised of both CE loss and Dice
loss to train the network. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons are carried
out extensively on in-house datasets, the experimental results show that our
proposed architecture outperforms the existing state-of-the-art segmentation
networks.

vision and pattern recognition. Coherent point drift (CPD) is a classical
method for nonrigid point set registration. However, to solve spatial
transformation functions, CPD has to compute inversion of a M*M matrix per
iteration with time complexity O(M3). By introducing a simple corresponding
constraint, we develop a fast implementation of CPD. The most advantage of our
method is to avoid matrix-inverse operation. Before the iteration begins, our
method requires to take eigenvalue decomposition of a M*M matrix once. After
iteration begins, our method only needs to update a diagonal matrix with linear
computational complexity, and perform matrix multiplication operation with time
complexity approximately O(M2) in each iteration. Besides, our method can be

algorithm that can optimally solve all optimization problems. This motivates
many researchers to continuously develop new optimization algorithms. In this
paper, a novel nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithm called
virus spread optimization (VSO) is proposed. VSO loosely mimics the spread of
viruses among hosts, and can be effectively applied to solving many challenging
and continuous optimization problems. We devise a new representation scheme and
viral operations that are radically different from previously proposed
virus-based optimization algorithms. First, the viral RNA of each host in VSO
denotes a potential solution for which different viral operations will help to
diversify the searching strategies in order to largely enhance the solution
quality. In addition, an imported infection mechanism, inheriting the searched
optima from another colony, is introduced to possibly avoid the prematuration
of any potential solution in solving complex problems. VSO has an excellent
capability to conduct adaptive neighborhood searches around the discovered
optima for achieving better solutions. Furthermore, with a flexible infection
mechanism, VSO can quickly escape from local optima. To clearly demonstrate
both its effectiveness and efficiency, VSO is critically evaluated on a series
of well-known benchmark functions. Moreover, VSO is validated on its
applicability through two real-world examples including the financial portfolio
optimization and optimization of hyper-parameters of support vector machines
for classification problems. The results show that VSO has attained superior
performance in terms of solution fitness, convergence rate, scalability,
reliability, and flexibility when compared to those results of the conventional
as well as state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimization algorithms.

In particular, in the case of circular polarization, it measures directly the

for review by the public regarding their artificial intelligence (AI) strategy.
The Montreal AI Ethics Institute (MAIEI) reviewed these documents and published
a response on 4 June 2020. MAIEI's response examines several questions that
touch on the proposed definition of AI; the people-centered nature of the
strategy; considerations to ensure that everyone benefits from AI; the
strategy's overarching vision; Scotland's AI ecosystem; the proposed strategic
themes; and how to grow public confidence in AI by building responsible and
ethical systems.
  In addition to examining the points above, MAIEI suggests that the strategy
be extended to include considerations on biometric data and how that will be
processed and used in the context of AI. It also highlights the importance of
tackling head-on the inherently stochastic nature of deep learning systems and
developing concrete guidelines to ensure that these systems are built
responsibly and ethically, particularly as machine learning becomes more
accessible. Finally, it concludes that any national AI strategy must clearly
address the measurements of success in regards to the strategy's stated goals
and vision to ensure that they are interpreted and applied consistently. To do
this, there must be inclusion and transparency between those building the
systems and those using them in their work.

Sing(X,s) of pairs (X,s), where X is a scheme and s is a global section of some
vector bundle over X. Sing(X,s) is defined as the kernel of the dg functor from
Sing(X_0) to Sing(X) induced by the pushforward along the inclusion of the
(derived) zero locus X_0 of s in X.
  In the first part, we restrict ourselves to the case where the vector bundle
is trivial. We prove a structure theorem for Sing(X,s) when X=Spec(B) is
affine. Roughly, it tells us that every object in Sing(X,s) is represented by a
complex of B-modules concentrated in n+1 consecutive degrees (if s \in B^n). By
specializing to the case n=1, we generalize Orlov's theorem, which identifies
Sing(X,s) with the dg category of matrix factorizations MF(X,s), to the case
where s \in O_X(X) is not flat.
  In the second part, we study the l-adic cohomology of Sing(X,s) (as defined
by A.~Blanc - M.~Robalo - B.~To\""en and G.~Vezzosi) when s is a global section
of a line bundle. In order to do so, we introduce the l-adic sheaf of
monodromy-invariant vanishing cycles. Using a theorem of D.~Orlov generalized
by J.~Burke and M.~Walker, we compute the l-adic realization of
Sing(Spec(B),(f_1,..,f_n)) for (f_1,..,f_n) \in B^n.
  In the last chapter, we introduce the l-adic sheaves of iterated vanishing
cycles of a scheme over a discrete valuation ring of rank 2. We relate one of
these l-adic sheaves to the l-adic realization of the dg category of
singularities of the fiber over a closed subscheme of the base.

with solar wind speed at 1 AU exceeding 500 km/s during 1995-2017, encompassing
the decline of solar cycle 22 to the decline of cycle 24. Events are detected
using measurements of the solar wind speed and the interplanetary magnetic

mass ejections (ICMEs) are removed by comparison with an existing ICME list.
Using this SIR/HSS event catalog (list given in the supplementary material), a
superposed epoch analysis of key solar wind parameters is carried out. It is
found that the number of SIR/HSSs peaks during the late declining phase of
solar cycle (SC) 23, as does their velocity, but that their geoeffectiveness in
terms of the AE and SYM-H indices is low. This can be explained by the
anomalously low values of magnetic field during the extended solar minimum.
Within SC23 and SC24, the highest geoeffectiveness of SIR/HSSs takes place
during the early declining phases. Geoeffectiveness of SIR/HSSs continues to be
up to 40% lower during SC24 than SC23, which can be explained by the solar wind
properties.

However, even in archetypical dilute magnetic semiconductors such as
Cd$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Te and Hg$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Te the evolution of this coupling with
the wave vector is not understood. A series of experiments have demonstrated
that exchange-induced splitting of magnetooptical spectra of Cd$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Te
and Zn$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Te at the L points of the Brillouin zone is, in
contradiction to the existing theories, more than one order of magnitude
smaller compared to its value at the zone center and can show an unexpected
sign of the effective Land\'e factors. The origin of these findings we
elucidate quantitatively by combining: (i) relativistic first-principles
density functional calculations; (ii) a tight-binding approach that takes
carefully into account k-dependence of the potential and kinetic sp-d exchange
interactions; (iii) a theory of magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) for $E_1$ and
$E_1$ + $\Delta_1$ optical transitions, developed here within the envelope
function $kp$ formalism for the L point of the Brillouin zone in zinc-blende
crystals. This combination of methods leads to the conclusion that the physics
of MCD at the boundary of the Brillouin zone is strongly affected by the
strength of two relativistic effects in particular compounds: (i) the
mass-velocity term that controls the distance of the conduction band at the L
point to the upper Hubbard band of Mn ions and, thus, a relative magnitude and
sign of the exchange splittings in the conduction and valence bands; (ii) the
spin-momentum locking by spin-orbit coupling that reduces exchange splitting
depending on the orientation of particular L valleys with respect to the
magnetization direction.

normative accounts of brain function, based on predictive coding in
hierarchical neural networks. The predicting coding rests on Bayesian
integration of beliefs and sensory evidence, with hierarchical predictions and
prediction errors, for memory, perception, speech and behaviour. We describe
how analogous impairments in predictive coding in parallel neurocognitive

He reacts with Si at high pressure, to form the stable compounds Si2He and
Si3He. Both compounds have host-guest structures consisting of a channel-like
Si host framework filled with He guest atoms. The Si frameworks in two

two pure Si allotropes. Both Si-He compounds and both Si allotropes exhibit
direct or quasi-direct band gaps of 0.84-1.34 eV, close to the optimal value

recognizes both static and dynamic gestures, using simple RGB vision (without
depth sensing). This feature makes it suitable for inexpensive human-robot
interaction in social or industrial settings. We employ a pose-driven spatial
attention strategy, which guides our proposed Static and Dynamic gestures
Network - StaDNet. From the image of the human upper body, we estimate his/her
depth, along with the region-of-interest around his/her hands. The
Convolutional Neural Network in StaDNet is fine-tuned on a
background-substituted hand gestures dataset. It is utilized to detect 10
static gestures for each hand as well as to obtain the hand image-embeddings.
These are subsequently fused with the augmented pose vector and then passed to
the stacked Long Short-Term Memory blocks. Thus, human-centred frame-wise
information from the augmented pose vector and from the left/right hands
image-embeddings are aggregated in time to predict the dynamic gestures of the
performing person. In a number of experiments, we show that the proposed
approach surpasses the state-of-the-art results on the large-scale Chalearn
2016 dataset. Moreover, we transfer the knowledge learned through the proposed
methodology to the Praxis gestures dataset, and the obtained results also
outscore the state-of-the-art on this dataset.

connected systems with time-delays for supervised learning. We present how the

analyze bifurcations of the corresponding autonomous system and compute
conditional Lyapunov exponents, which measure the generalized synchronization
between the input and the layer dynamics. We show how the MC is related to the
systems distance to bifurcations or magnitude of the conditional Lyapunov
exponent. The interplay of different dynamical regimes leads to a adjustable
distribution between linear and nonlinear MC. Furthermore, numerical
simulations show resonances between clock cycle and delays of the layers in all
degrees of the MC. Contrary to MC losses in a single-layer reservoirs, these
resonances can boost separate degrees of the MC and can be used, e.g., to
design a system with maximum linear MC. Accordingly, we present two
configurations that empower either high nonlinear MC or long time linear MC.

include - reliance on ratings of very few respondents to infer about all
customers' online interactions; failing to capture a customer's interactions
over time since the rating is a one-time snapshot; and inability to tie back
customers' ratings to specific interactions because ratings provided relate to
all interactions. To overcome these deficiencies we extract proxy ratings from
clickstream data, typically collected for every customer's online interactions,
by developing an approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). We introduce a
new way to interpret values generated by the value function of RL, as proxy
ratings. Our approach does not need any survey data for training. Yet, on
validation against actual survey data, proxy ratings yield reasonable
performance results. Additionally, we offer a new way to draw insights from
values of the value function, which allow associating specific interactions to
their proxy ratings. We introduce two new metrics to represent ratings - one,
customer-level and the other, aggregate-level for click actions across
customers. Both are defined around proportion of all pairwise, successive
actions that show increase in proxy ratings. This intuitive customer-level
metric enables gauging the dynamics of ratings over time and is a better
predictor of purchase than customer ratings from survey. The aggregate-level
metric allows pinpointing actions that help or hurt experience. In sum, proxy
ratings computed unobtrusively from clickstream, for every action, for each
customer, and for every session can offer interpretable and more insightful
alternative to surveys.

enable the registration of multimodal images where existing registration
methods often fail due to a lack of sufficiently similar image structures.
CoMIRs reduce the multimodal registration problem to a monomodal one, in which
general intensity-based, as well as feature-based, registration algorithms can
be applied. The method involves training one neural network per modality on
aligned images, using a contrastive loss based on noise-contrastive estimation
(InfoNCE). Unlike other contrastive coding methods, used for, e.g.,
classification, our approach generates image-like representations that contain
the information shared between modalities. We introduce a novel,
hyperparameter-free modification to InfoNCE, to enforce rotational equivariance
of the learnt representations, a property essential to the registration task.
We assess the extent of achieved rotational equivariance and the stability of
the representations with respect to weight initialization, training set, and
hyperparameter settings, on a remote sensing dataset of RGB and near-infrared
images. We evaluate the learnt representations through registration of a
biomedical dataset of bright-field and second-harmonic generation microscopy
images; two modalities with very little apparent correlation. The proposed
approach based on CoMIRs significantly outperforms registration of
representations created by GAN-based image-to-image translation, as well as a
state-of-the-art, application-specific method which takes additional knowledge

actuated signals at each cycle based on QLs. The proposed method is implemented
at a single intersection with random and platoon arrivals, and evaluated in
VISSIM (a microscopic traffic simulation environment) assuming 100 % accurate
cycle-by-cycle queue length information is available. To test the robustness of
the method, numerical experiments are performed where traffic demand is
increased and by 20\% relative to the demand levels for which signal timing
parameters are optimized. Compared to the typical fully-actuated signal
control, the proposed QL-based method improves average delay, number of stops,
and QL for random arrivals, by 6 %, 9 %, and 10 % respectively. In addition,
the method improves average delay, number of stops, and QL by 3 %, 3 %, and 11
% respectively for platoon vehicle arrivals.

In particular, for a single source-destination pair in which a radio frequency

transmissions of status updates from the source to the destination, and the
wireless energy transfer (WET) are jointly optimized. After proving the
monotonicity property of the value function associated with the MDP, we
analytically demonstrate that the AoI-optimal policy has a threshold-based

specifically, we study the problem of explaining the inference steps that one
can take during propagation, in a way that is easy to interpret for a person.
Thereby, we aim to give the constraint solver explainable agency, which can
help in building trust in the solver by being able to understand and even learn
from the explanations. The main challenge is that of finding a sequence of
simple explanations, where each explanation should aim to be as cognitively
easy as possible for a human to verify and understand. This contrasts with the
arbitrary combination of facts and constraints that the solver may use when
propagating. We propose the use of a cost function to quantify how simple an
individual explanation of an inference step is, and identify the
explanation-production problem of finding the best sequence of explanations of
a CSP. Our approach is agnostic of the underlying constraint propagation
mechanisms, and can provide explanations even for inference steps resulting
from combinations of constraints. In case multiple constraints are involved, we
also develop a mechanism that allows to break the most difficult steps up and
thus gives the user the ability to zoom in on specific parts of the
explanation. Our proposed algorithm iteratively constructs the explanation
sequence by using an optimistic estimate of the cost function to guide the
search for the best explanation at each step. Our experiments on logic grid
puzzles show the feasibility of the approach in terms of the quality of the
individual explanations and the resulting explanation sequences obtained.

machine learning systems. Medical image analysis (MedIA) systems have recently
been argued to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to strong financial
incentives and the associated technological infrastructure.
  In this paper, we study previously unexplored factors affecting adversarial
attack vulnerability of deep learning MedIA systems in three medical domains:
ophthalmology, radiology, and pathology. We focus on adversarial black-box
settings, in which the attacker does not have full access to the target model
and usually uses another model, commonly referred to as surrogate model, to
craft adversarial examples. We consider this to be the most realistic scenario
for MedIA systems.
  Firstly, we study the effect of weight initialization (ImageNet vs. random)
on the transferability of adversarial attacks from the surrogate model to the
target model. Secondly, we study the influence of differences in development
data between target and surrogate models. We further study the interaction of
weight initialization and data differences with differences in model
architecture. All experiments were done with a perturbation degree tuned to
ensure maximal transferability at minimal visual perceptibility of the attacks.
  Our experiments show that pre-training may dramatically increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, even when the target and surrogate's
architectures are different: the larger the performance gain using
pre-training, the larger the transferability. Differences in the development
data between target and surrogate models considerably decrease the performance
of the attack; this decrease is further amplified by difference in the model

tasks sequentially. The goal of maintaining knowledge of earlier tasks without
re-accessing them starkly conflicts with standard SGD training for artificial
neural networks. An influential method to tackle this problem without storing
old data are so-called regularisation approaches. They measure the importance
of each parameter for solving a given task and subsequently protect important
parameters from large changes. In the literature, three ways to measure
parameter importance have been put forward and they have inspired a large body
of follow-up work. Here, we present strong theoretical and empirical evidence
that these three methods, Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic
Intelligence (SI) and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are surprisingly similar and
are all linked to the same theoretical quantity. Concretely, we show that,
despite stemming from very different motivations, both SI and MAS approximate
the square root of the Fisher Information, with the Fisher being the
theoretically justified basis of EWC. Moreover, we show that for SI the
relation to the Fisher -- and in fact its performance -- is due to a previously
unknown bias. On top of uncovering unknown similarities and unifying
regularisation approaches, we also demonstrate that our insights enable
practical performance improvements for large batch training.

estimating causal effects when one has access to an instrument. However, to
achieve identifiability, they in general require one-size-fits-all assumptions
such as an additive error model for the outcome. An alternative is partial
identification, which provides bounds on the causal effect. Little exists in
terms of bounding methods that can deal with the most general case, where the
treatment itself can be continuous. Moreover, bounding methods generally do not
allow for a continuum of assumptions on the shape of the causal effect that can
smoothly trade off stronger background knowledge for more informative bounds.
In this work, we provide a method for causal effect bounding in continuous
distributions, leveraging recent advances in gradient-based methods for the
optimization of computationally intractable objective functions. We demonstrate
on a set of synthetic and real-world data that our bounds capture the causal
effect when additive methods fail, providing a useful range of answers
compatible with observation as opposed to relying on unwarranted structural
assumptions.

Therefore, if micron-size grains are dominant in a dusty gas slab, the high CP

enabling the recovery of sparse Dirac streams from uniform low-pass filtered
samples. An extension of this framework, called generalised FRI (genFRI), has
been recently proposed for handling cases with arbitrary linear measurement
models. In this context, signal reconstruction amounts to solving a joint
constrained optimisation problem, yielding estimates of both the Fourier series
coefficients of the Dirac stream and its so-called annihilating filter,
involved in the regularisation term. This optimisation problem is however
highly non convex and non linear in the data. Moreover, the proposed numerical
solver is computationally intensive and without convergence guarantee.
  In this work, we propose an implicit formulation of the genFRI problem. To
this end, we leverage a novel regularisation term which does not depend
explicitly on the unknown annihilating filter yet enforces sufficient structure
in the solution for stable recovery. The resulting optimisation problem is
still non convex, but simpler since linear in the data and with less unknowns.
We solve it by means of a provably convergent proximal gradient descent (PGD)
method. Since the proximal step does not admit a simple closed-form expression,
we propose an inexact PGD method, coined as Cadzow plug-and-play gradient
descent (CPGD). The latter approximates the proximal steps by means of Cadzow
denoising, a well-known denoising algorithm in FRI. We provide local
fixed-point convergence guarantees for CPGD. Through extensive numerical
simulations, we demonstrate the superiority of CPGD against the
state-of-the-art in the case of non uniform time samples.

stable and high-quality beam delivery is needed, is the challenge to design and
fabricate an IC-guiding fiber that combines ultra-low loss, truly and robust
single-modeness, and polarization-maintaining operation. Design solutions
proposed up to now require a trade-off between low loss and truly single
modeness. Here, we propose a novel concept of IC HCPCF for obtaining low-loss

cladding composed of a Kagome-tubular lattice (HKT). This new concept of
microstructured cladding allows to significantly reduce confinement loss and,
at the same time, preserving a truly and robust single-mode operation.
Experimental results show a HKT-IC-HCPCF with a minimum loss figure of 1.6
dB/km at 1050 nm and a higher-order modes extinction ratio as high as 47.0 dB
for a 10 m long fiber. The robustness of the fiber single-modeness was tested
by moving the fiber and varying the coupling conditions. The design proposed
herein opens a new route for the accomplishment of HCPCFs that combine robust
ultralow loss transmission and single-mode beam delivery and provides new
insight into the understanding of IC guidance.

overcoming this issue. However, most online algorithms are centralized and work
on convex problems (which GNNs rarely lead to). This paper proposes the Wide
and Deep GNN (WD-GNN), a novel architecture that can be easily updated with
distributed online learning mechanisms. The WD-GNN comprises two components:
the wide part is a bank of linear graph filters and the deep part is a GNN. At
training time, the joint architecture learns a nonlinear representation from
data. At testing time, the deep part (nonlinear) is left unchanged, while the
wide part is retrained online, leading to a convex problem. We derive
convergence guarantees for this online retraining procedure and further propose
a decentralized alternative. Experiments on the robot swarm control for
flocking corroborate theory and show potential of the proposed architecture for
distributed online learning.

for large scale machine learning tasks. Among them, local stochastic gradient
descent (Local SGD) has attracted significant attention due to its low
communication complexity. Previous studies prove that the communication
complexity of Local SGD with a fixed or an adaptive communication period is in
the order of $O (N^{\frac{3}{2}} T^{\frac{1}{2}})$ and $O (N^{\frac{3}{4}}
T^{\frac{3}{4}})$ when the data distributions on clients are identical (IID) or
otherwise (Non-IID), where $N$ is the number of clients and $T$ is the number
of iterations. In this paper, to accelerate the convergence by reducing the
communication complexity, we propose \textit{ST}agewise \textit{L}ocal
\textit{SGD} (STL-SGD), which increases the communication period gradually
along with decreasing learning rate. We prove that STL-SGD can keep the same
convergence rate and linear speedup as mini-batch SGD. In addition, as the
benefit of increasing the communication period, when the objective is strongly
convex or satisfies the Polyak-\L ojasiewicz condition, the communication
complexity of STL-SGD is $O (N \log{T})$ and $O (N^{\frac{1}{2}}
T^{\frac{1}{2}})$ for the IID case and the Non-IID case respectively, achieving
significant improvements over Local SGD. Experiments on both convex and
non-convex problems demonstrate the superior performance of STL-SGD.

each node to dynamically point to another node, followed by message passing

learning tractable while still being sufficiently expressive to simulate
complex algorithms. Critically, the pointing mechanism is directly supervised
to model long-term sequences of operations on classical data structures,
incorporating useful structural inductive biases from theoretical computer
science. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that PGNs can learn parallelisable
variants of pointer-based data structures, namely disjoint set unions and

problems. Due to rapid rotation such systems will become oblate, with a
latitudinal variation in the gravitational acceleration across the surface of
the object. In the case of accreting neutron stars, rapid rotation could lead
to a polar radius smaller than the equatorial radius by a factor $\sim 0.8$. We
investigate how the oblateness and a changing gravitational acceleration affect
different hydrodynamic modes that exist in such fluid layers through analytic
approximations and numerical calculations. The wave vectors of $g$-modes and
Yanai modes increase for more oblate systems compared to spherical
counterparts, although the impact of variations in the changing gravitational
acceleration is effectively negligible. We find that for increased oblateness,
Kelvin modes show less equatorial confinement and little change in their wave
vector. For $r$-modes, we find that for more oblate systems the wave vector
decreases. The exact manner of these changes for the $r$-modes depends on the
model for the gravitational acceleration across the surface.

where the sample size and dimension go to infinity at a proportional rate. In
particular, we consider the role played by the structure of the true regression

reduced to the case of a random parameter from a structured prior. The latter
assumption is a natural adaptation of classic smoothness assumptions in
nonparametric regression, which are known as source conditions in the the
context of regularization theory for inverse problems. Roughly speaking, we
assume the large coefficients of the parameter are in correspondence to the
principal components. In this setting a precise characterisation of the test
error is obtained, depending on the inputs covariance and regression parameter
structure. We illustrate this characterisation in a simplified setting to
investigate the influence of the true parameter on optimal regularisation for
overparameterized models. We show that interpolation (no regularisation) can be
optimal even with bounded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), provided that the
parameter coefficients are larger on high-variance directions of the data,
corresponding to a more regular function than posited by the regularization
term. This contrasts with previous work considering ridge regression with
isotropic prior, in which case interpolation is only optimal in the limit of
infinite SNR.

around the star, and the subsequent core collapse results in a Type IIn
supernova that is characterized by interaction between supernova ejecta and
circumstellar matter. The energy source that triggers these mass eruptions and
dynamics of the outflow have not been clearly explained. Moreover, the mass
eruption itself can alter the density structure of the envelope and affect the
dynamics of the subsequent mass eruption if these events are repeated. A large
amount of observational evidence suggests multiple mass eruptions prior to core
collapse. We investigate the density structure of the envelope altered by the
first mass eruption and the nature of the subsequent second mass eruption event
in comparison with the first event. We deposited extra energy at the bottom of
the hydrogen envelope of 15$M_\odot$ stars twice and calculated the time
evolution by radiation hydrodynamical simulation code. We did not deal with the
origin of the energy source, but focused on the dynamics of repeated mass
eruptions from a single massive star. There are significant differences between
the first and second mass eruptions in terms of the luminosity and the color.
The second eruption leads to a redder burst event in which the associated
brightening phase lasts longer than the first. The amount of ejected matter is
different even with the same deposited energy in the first and second event,
but the difference depends on the density structure of the star. Upcoming high
cadence and deep transient surveys will provide us a lot of pre-supernova
activities, and some of which might show multi-peaked light curves. These
should be interpreted taking the effect of density structure altered by the
preceding outburst events into consideration.

the Suzuki and Ree curves. Previously, the now well-known GK curves were found
as cyclic extensions of the Hermitian curve. In this paper, we consider locally
recoverable codes constructed from these new curves, complementing that done
for the GK curve. Locally recoverable codes allow for the recovery of a single
symbol by accessing only a few others which form what is known as a recovery
set. If every symbol has at least two disjoint recovery sets, the code is said
to have availability. Three constructions are described, as each best fits a
particular situation. The first employs the original construction of locally
recoverable codes from curves by Tamo and Barg. The second yields codes with
availability by appealing to the use of fiber products as described by
Haymaker, Malmskog, and Matthews, while the third accomplishes availability by
taking products of codes themselves. We see that cyclic extensions of the
Deligne-Lusztig curves provide codes with smaller locality than those typically
found in the literature.

from a more cooperative behavior to a less cooperative one at some step of the
game. Payoffs are survival probabilities and lone individuals have to finish
the game on their own. We explore the potential of these games to support
cooperation, focusing on the case in which each single step is a Prisoner's
Dilemma. We find that incentives for or against cooperation depend on the
number of defections at the end of the game, as opposed to the number of steps
in the game. Broadly, cooperation is supported when the survival prospects of
lone individuals are relatively bleak. Specifically, we find three critical
values or cutoffs for the loner survival probability which, in concert with
other survival parameters, determine the incentives for or against cooperation.
One cutoff determines the existence of an optimal number of defections against
a fully cooperative partner, one determines whether additional defections
eventually become disfavored as the number of defections by the partner
increases, and one determines whether additional cooperations eventually become
favored as the number of defections by the partner increases. We obtain
expressions for these switch-points and for optimal numbers of defections
against partners with various strategies. These typically involve small numbers
of defections even in very long games. We show that potentially long stretches
of equilibria may exist, in which there is no incentive to defect more or
cooperate more. We describe how individuals find equilibria in best-response
walks among strategies, and establish that evolutionary stability requires
there be just one such equilibrium. Otherwise, equilibria are not protected
against invasion by strategies with fewer defections.

protostars up to $\sim25\:M_\odot$. However, to form more massive protostars,

flaring on minute timescales and evidence for wind outflows at both X-ray and
optical wavelengths, strong and variable local absorption, and an anomalously
hard X-ray spectrum. Here, we report on a detailed radio observing campaign
consisting of one observation at 5.5/9 GHz with the Australia Telescope Compact
Array, and nine observations at 4.5/7.5 GHz with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array. A radio counterpart with a flat to inverted radio spectrum is detected
in all observations, consistent with a compact jet being launched from the
system. Swift J1858.6-0814 is highly variable at radio wavelengths in most
observations, showing significant variability when imaged on 3-to-5-minute
timescales and changing up to factors of 8 within 20 minutes. The periods of
brightest radio emission are not associated with steep radio spectra, implying
they do not originate from the launching of discrete ejecta. We find that the
radio variability is similarly unlikely to have a geometric origin, be due to
scintillation, or be causally related to the observed X-ray flaring. Instead,
we find that it is consistent with being driven by variations in the accretion
flow propagating down the compact jet. We compare the radio properties of Swift
J1858.6-0814 with those of Eddington-limited X-ray binaries with similar X-ray
and optical characteristics, but fail to find a match in radio variability,

Therefore, an effective and bespoke iterative solver is a key ingredient of any

these preconditioners capture additional significant components of the
stochastic Galerkin matrix. Focusing on the parametric diffusion equation as a
model problem and assuming affine-parametric representation of the diffusion
coefficient, we perform spectral analysis of the preconditioned matrices and
establish optimality of truncation preconditioners with respect to SGFEM
discretization parameters. Furthermore, we report the results of numerical
experiments for model diffusion problems with affine and non-affine parametric

the solver (in terms of iteration counts for solving the underlying linear
systems) and compare truncation preconditioners with other existing

the lobula giant movement detectors (LGMDs) in locusts and the lobula plate
tangential cells (LPTCs) in flies, have been studied, intensively. The LGMDs
have specific selectivity to approaching objects in depth that threaten
collision; whilst the LPTCs are only sensitive to translating objects in
horizontal and vertical directions. Though each has been modelled and applied
in various visual scenes including robot scenarios, little has been done on
investigating their complementary functionality and selectivity when
functioning together. To fill this vacancy, we introduce a hybrid model
combining two LGMDs (LGMD-1 and LGMD-2) with horizontally (rightward and
leftward) sensitive LPTCs (LPTC-R and LPTC-L) specialising in fast collision
perception. With coordination and competition between different activated
neurons, the proximity feature by frontal approaching stimuli can be largely
sharpened up by suppressing translating and receding motions. The proposed
method has been implemented in ground micro-mobile robots as embedded systems.
The multi-robot experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness
of the proposed model for frontal collision sensing, which outperforms previous
single-type neuron computation methods against translating interference.

for learning in artificial neural network models, includes features which are
biologically implausible for learning in real neural circuits. An alternative
called target propagation proposes to solve this implausibility by using a
top-down model of neural activity to convert an error at the output of a neural
network into layer-wise and plausible 'targets' for every unit. These targets
can then be used to produce weight updates for network training. However, thus
far, target propagation has been heuristically proposed without demonstrable
equivalence to backpropagation. Here, we derive an exact correspondence between
backpropagation and a modified form of target propagation (GAIT-prop) where the
target is a small perturbation of the forward pass. Specifically,
backpropagation and GAIT-prop give identical updates when synaptic weight
matrices are orthogonal. In a series of simple computer vision experiments, we
show near-identical performance between backpropagation and GAIT-prop with a
soft orthogonality-inducing regularizer.

computer vision tasks. However, a neural network architecture design usually
faces a trade-off between model performance and computational/memory
complexity. For some real-world applications, it is crucial to develop models,
which can be fast and light enough to run on edge systems and mobile devices.
However, many modern architectures that demonstrate good performance don't
satisfy inference time and storage limitation requirements. Thus, arises a
problem of neural network compression to obtain a smaller and faster model,
which is on par with the initial one.
  In this work, we consider a neural network compression method based on tensor
decompositions. Namely, we propose to approximate the convolutional layer
weight with a tensor, which can be represented as a sum of low-rank and sparse
components. The motivation for such approximation is based on the assumption
that low-rank and sparse terms allow eliminating two different types of
redundancy and thus yield a better compression rate. An efficient CPU

demonstrated up to 3.5x CPU layer speedup and 11x layer size reduction when

(near) Pareto optimal solutions. A decision maker then navigates this set to
select a final desired solution, often using a visualization of the
approximation front. The front provides a navigational ordering of solutions to
traverse, but this ordering does not necessarily map to a smooth trajectory
through decision space. This forces the decision maker to inspect the decision
variables of each solution individually, potentially making navigation of the
approximation set unintuitive. In this work, we aim to improve approximation
set navigability by enforcing a form of smoothness or continuity between
solutions in terms of their decision variables. Imposing smoothness as a
restriction upon common domination-based multi-objective evolutionary
algorithms is not straightforward. Therefore, we use the recently introduced
uncrowded hypervolume (UHV) to reformulate the multi-objective optimization
problem as a single-objective problem in which parameterized approximation sets
are directly optimized. We study here the case of parameterizing approximation
sets as smooth Bezier curves in decision space. We approach the resulting
single-objective problem with the gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary
algorithm (GOMEA), and we call the resulting algorithm BezEA. We analyze the
behavior of BezEA and compare it to optimization of the UHV with GOMEA as well
as the domination-based multi-objective GOMEA. We show that high-quality
approximation sets can be obtained with BezEA, sometimes even outperforming the
domination- and UHV-based algorithms, while smoothness of the navigation

We perform N-body simulations to investigate the growth and migration of
low-mass protoplanets in the disk with inner viscously heated and outer stellar
irradiated regions. The key feature of this model is that the giant planet
cores grow rapidly by a combination of pebble accretion and planet-planet
collisions. This consequently speeds up their gas accretion. Because of
efficient growth, the planet transitions from rapid type I migration to slow
type II migration early, reducing the inward migration substantially. Multiple
giant planets can sequentially form in this way with increasing semimajor axes.
Both mass growth and orbital retention are more pronounced when a large number
of protoplanets are taken into account compared to the case of single planet
growth. Eventually, a few numbers of giant planets form with orbital distances
of a few to a few tens of AUs within $1.5{-}3$ Myr after the birth of the
protoplanets. The resulting simulated planet populations could be linked to the
substructures exhibited in disk observations as well as large orbital distance

inferred via the joint action-value function in multi-agent reinforcement
learning and quantified to label the necessity of agent-agent communication.
Furthermore, the agent policy is regularized to better exploit communicated

In order to challenge the existing MAD algorithms, the morphed images are with
careful subject pre-selection created from the contributing images, and further
post-processed to remove morphing artifacts. The images are also printed and
scanned to remove all digital cues and to simulate a realistic challenge for
MAD algorithms. Further, we present a new online evaluation platform to test

(MPE)-based algorithm for global point set registration. The feature
descriptors extraction algorithms have emerged as the standard approach to
align point sets in the past few decades. However, the alignment can be
challenging to take effect when the point set suffers from raw point data
problems such as noises (Gaussian and Uniformly). Different from the most
existing point set registration methods which usually extract the descriptors
to find correspondences between point sets, our proposed MPE alignment method
is able to handle large scale raw data offset without depending on traditional
descriptors extraction, whether for the local or global registration methods.
We decompose the solution into a global optimal convex approximation and the
fast descent process to a local minimum. For the approximation step, the
proposed minimum potential energy (MPE) approach consists of two main steps.
Firstly, according to the construction of the force traction operator, we could
simply compute the position of the potential energy minimum; Secondly, with
respect to the finding of the MPE point, we propose a new theory that employs
the two flags to observe the status of the registration procedure. The method
of fast descent process to the minimum that we employed is the iterative
closest point algorithm; it can achieve the global minimum. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed algorithm on synthetic data as well as on real

beam formed by two plane waves enables much stronger near-field effects: a
deeply subwavelength focusing of the incident beam and a strong enhancement of
the electric field on the whole cylinder surface and near it. The domination of
the evanescent waves in the vicinity of the cylinder results from the
destructive interference of the propagating spatial harmonics of the scattered
field dictated by the incident wave beam.

energy fcc metals has been debated for almost 70 years. Despite numerous
experimental and simulation studies, many issues regarding the nucleation and
growth of cube grains remain unresolved. Here we apply a full field crystal
plasticity model utilizing a dislocation density based constitutive theory to
study the deformation and texture evolution in copper (Cu) under plane strain
compression. Additionally, we use the phase field method, along with a
stochastic nucleation model, for static recrystallization simulations.
Simulation results show that the volume fraction of the cube component during
deformation decreases with increasing strain. Although cube grains are not
stable during plane strain compression, some of the non-cube grains rotate
towards cube and develop narrow cube bands near the grain boundary region. With
increasing deformation, the cube component accumulates dislocation density
faster than other texture components. High stored energy in the cube regions
leads to preferential nucleation of cube grains during static
recrystallization. These cube nuclei originate from the intergranular cube
bands. Although the cube component has a clear nucleation advantage, none of
the texture component appears to have a growth advantage. Instead, simulation
results show that heterogeneous distribution of nuclei has a profound influence
on the resulting grain size distribution. During recrystallization, a
significant increase in cube volume fraction is observed mainly due to high
nucleation frequency of cube grains.

manifests in the emergence of superinsulation, a state dual to

charge confinement by a magnetic monopole plasma. This plasma constricts
electric field lines connecting the charge-anti-charge pairs into electric
strings, in analogy to quarks within hadrons. Yet the origin of the monopole

superinsulation as two-dimensional quantum tunneling events. We calculate the
string tension and the dimension of an electric pion determining the minimal
size of a system capable of hosting superinsulation. Our findings pave the way

symbols may have errors. It is motivated by the application of fountain codes
in DNA-based data storage systems where the inner code decoding, which
generally has undetectable errors, is performed before the outer fountain code
decoding. We propose a novel and efficient decoding algorithm, namely
basis-finding algorithm (BFA), followed by three implementations. The key idea
of the BFA is to find a basis of the received symbols, and then use the most
reliable basis elements to recover the source symbols with the inactivation
decoding. Gaussian elimination is used to find the basis and to identify the
most reliable basis elements. As a result, the BFA has polynomial time
complexity. For random fountain codes, we are able to derive some theoretical
bounds for the frame error rate (FER) of the BFA. Extensive simulations with
Luby transform (LT) codes show that, the BFA has significantly lower FER than
the belief propagation (BP) algorithm except for an extremely large amount of
received symbols, and the FER of the BFA generally decreases as the average
weight of basis elements increases.

processing with convolutional neural networks. While transfer learning assumes
that the learning process for a target task will benefit from re-using
representations learned for another task, anti-transfer avoids the learning of
representations that have been learned for an orthogonal task, i.e., one that
is not relevant and potentially misleading for the target task, such as speaker
identity for speech recognition or speech content for emotion recognition. In
anti-transfer learning, we penalize similarity between activations of a network
being trained and another one previously trained on an orthogonal task, which
yields more suitable representations. This leads to better generalization and
provides a degree of control over correlations that are spurious or
undesirable, e.g. to avoid social bias. We have implemented anti-transfer for
convolutional neural networks in different configurations with several
similarity metrics and aggregation functions, which we evaluate and analyze
with several speech and audio tasks and settings, using six datasets. We show
that anti-transfer actually leads to the intended invariance to the orthogonal
task and to more appropriate features for the target task at hand.
Anti-transfer learning consistently improves classification accuracy in all
test cases. While anti-transfer creates computation and memory cost at training
time, there is relatively little computation cost when using pre-trained models
for orthogonal tasks. Anti-transfer is widely applicable and particularly
useful where a specific invariance is desirable or where trained models are
available and labeled data for orthogonal tasks are difficult to obtain.

known as Bayes Factors, which are directly related to Posterior Probabilities
of models. Bayes Factors require a careful assessment of prior distributions as
in the Intrinsic Priors of Berger and Pericchi (1996a) and integration over the
parameter space, which may be highly dimensional. Recently researchers have
been proposing alternatives to Bayes Factors that require neither integration
nor specification of priors. These developments are still in a very early stage
and are known as Prior-free Bayes Factors, Cross-Validation Bayes Factors
(CVBF), and Bayesian ""Stacking."" This kind of method and Intrinsic Bayes Factor
(IBF) both avoid the specification of prior. However, this Prior-free Bayes
factor might need a careful choice of a training sample size. In this article,
a way of choosing training sample sizes for the Prior-free Bayes factor based
on Geometric Intrinsic Bayes Factors (GIBFs) is proposed and studied. We
present essential examples with a different number of parameters and study the
statistical behavior both numerically and theoretically to explain the ideas
for choosing a feasible training sample size for Prior-free Bayes Factors. We
put forward the ""Bridge Rule"" as an assignment of a training sample size for
CVBF's that makes them close to Geometric IBFs. We conclude that even though
tractable Geometric IBFs are preferable, CVBF's, using the Bridge Rule, are
useful and economical approximations to Bayes Factors.

strategy that allows us to train robust generalized linear models of
interacting neurons, by explicitly separating the effects of correlations in
the stimulus from network interactions in each training step. Applying this
approach to the responses of retinal ganglion cells to complex visual stimuli,
we show that, compared to classical methods, the models trained in this way
exhibit improved performance, are more stable, yield robust interaction
networks, and generalize well across complex visual statistics. The method can
be extended to deep convolutional neural networks, leading to models with high
predictive accuracy for both the neuron firing rates and their correlations.

paper, we investigated the role of multivalent actin-binding proteins (ABPs) in
reorganizing actin filaments into higher-order complex networks via a computer
model of semiflexible filaments. We characterize the importance of local
connectivity among actin filaments as well as the global features of actomyosin

using principles from network-theory order parameters, combine properties from
these representations to gain insight on the heterogeneous morphologies of
actomyosin networks at a global level. We find that ABPs with a valency greater
than two promote filament bundles and large filament clusters to a much greater
extent than bivalent multilinkers. We also show that active myosin-like motor
proteins promote the formation of dendritic branches from a stalk of actin
bundles. Our work motivates future studies to embrace network theory as a tool
to characterize complex morphologies of actomyosin detected by experiments,
leading to a quantitative understanding of the role of ABPs in manipulating the
self-assembly of actin filaments into unique architectures that underlie the

research on business processes, like the well-known soundness property, lies on
correctness with regards to execution semantics of modeling languages. Among
others, soundness requires proper completion of process instances. However, the
question of whether participants have any interest in working towards
completion (or in participating in the process) has not been addressed as of

  In this work, we investigate whether inter-organizational business processes
give participants incentives for achieving the common business goals---in
short, whether incentives are aligned with the process. In particular, fair
behavior should pay off and efficient completion of tasks should be rewarded.
We propose a game-theoretic approach that relies on algorithms for solving
stochastic games from the machine learning community. We describe a method for
checking incentive alignment of process models with utility annotations for
tasks, which can be used for a priori analysis of inter-organizational business
processes. Last but not least, we show that the soundness property corresponds

resulting SOs. A further aim of this investigation is to determine whether such

challenging problem. Standard feed-forward neural networks combine linear or,

Their geometric modeling is limited, which motivated the prior work introducing
the multilayer hypersphere perceptron (MLHP). Its constituent part, i.e., the
hypersphere neuron, is obtained by applying a conformal embedding of Euclidean
space. By virtue of Clifford algebra, it can be implemented as the Cartesian
dot product of inputs and weights. If the embedding is applied in a manner
consistent with the dimensionality of the input space geometry, the decision
surfaces of the model units become combinations of hyperspheres and make the
decision-making process geometrically interpretable for humans. Our extension
of the MLHP model, the multilayer geometric perceptron (MLGP), and its
respective layer units, i.e., geometric neurons, are consistent with the 3D

particular, the geometric neuron activations are isometric in 3D, which is
necessary for rotation and translation equivariance. When classifying the 3D
Tetris shapes, we quantitatively show that our model requires no activation

vanilla multilayer perceptron. In the presence of noise in the data, our model
is also superior to the MLHP.

technique, is now commonly used in breast cancer screening and diagnostics.
Still, the severely limited 3rd dimension information in DBT has not been used,
until now, to estimate the true breast density or the patient-specific dose.
This study proposes a reconstruction algorithm for DBT based on deep learning
specifically optimized for these tasks. The algorithm, which we name DBToR, is
based on unrolling a proximal-dual optimization method. The proximal operators
are replaced with convolutional neural networks and prior knowledge is included
in the model. This extends previous work on a deep learning-based
reconstruction model by providing both the primal and the dual blocks with
breast thickness information, which is available in DBT. Training and testing
of the model were performed using virtual patient phantoms from two different
sources. Reconstruction performance, and accuracy in estimation of breast
density and radiation dose, were estimated, showing high accuracy (density
<+/-3%; dose <+/-20%) without bias, significantly improving on the current
state-of-the-art. This work also lays the groundwork for developing a deep

  Principles of Computer Systems (APOCS) 2021",,,,"cs.NI cs.DC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In order to provide a high resilience and to react quickly to link failures,
modern computer networks support fully decentralized flow rerouting, also known
as local fast failover. In a nutshell, the task of a local fast failover
algorithm is to pre-define fast failover rules for each node using locally
available information only. These rules determine for each incoming link from
which a packet may arrive and the set of local link failures (i.e., the failed
links incident to a node), on which outgoing link a packet should be forwarded.
Ideally, such a local fast failover algorithm provides a perfect resilience
deterministically: a packet emitted from any source can reach any target, as
long as the underlying network remains connected. Feigenbaum et al. (ACM PODC
2012) and also Chiesa et al. (IEEE/ACM Trans. Netw. 2017) showed that it is not
always possible to provide perfect resilience. Interestingly, not much more is
known currently about the feasibility of perfect resilience.
  This paper revisits perfect resilience with local fast failover, both in a
model where the source can and cannot be used for forwarding decisions. We
first derive several fairly general impossibility results: By establishing a
connection between graph minors and resilience, we prove that it is impossible
to achieve perfect resilience on any non-planar graph; furthermore, while
planarity is necessary, it is also not sufficient for perfect resilience. On
the positive side, we show that graph families closed under link subdivision
allow for simple and efficient failover algorithms which simply skip failed
links. We demonstrate this technique by deriving perfect resilience for
outerplanar graphs and related scenarios, as well as for scenarios where the
source and target are topologically close after failures.

Berry phase. Several investigations have discussed, in an inexplicit way, the
connections between both concepts, hinting at that nonzero topological charges
for far-field polarizations on a loop is inextricably linked to its nontrivial
Berry phase when degeneracies are enclosed. In this work, we reexamine the
seminal photonic crystal slab that supports the fundamental two-level
nonhermitian degeneracies. Regardless of the invariance of nontrivial Berry
phase for different loops enclosing both exceptional points, we demonstrate
that the associated polarization fields exhibit topologically inequivalent
patterns that are characterized by variant topological charges, including even
the trivial scenario of zero charge. It is further revealed that for both
bands, the seemingly complex evolutions of polarizations are bounded by the
global charge conservation, with extra points of circular polarizations playing
indispensable roles. This indicates that tough not directly associated with any
local charges, the invariant Berry phase is directly linked to the globally
conserved charge, the physical principles underlying which have all been
further clarified by a modified Berry-Dennis model. Our work can potentially
trigger an avalanche of studies to explore subtle interplays between Berry
phase and all sorts of optical singularities, shedding new light on subjects

time, such that the phase-reference is lost after $m$ consecutive uses of the
transmission line. This problem is relevant for long-distance communication in
free space and optical fiber, where phase noise is typically considered as a
limiting factor. The Holevo capacity of these channels is always attained with
photon-number encodings, challenging with current technology. Hence for
coherent-state encodings the optimal rate depends only on the total-energy
distribution and we provide upper and lower bounds for all $m$, the latter
attainable at low energies with on/off modulation and photodetection. We
generalize this lower bound to squeezed-coherent encodings, exhibiting for the
first time to our knowledge an unconditional advantage with respect to any
coherent encoding for $m=1$ and a considerable advantage with respect to its
direct coherent counterpart for $m>1$. This advantage is robust with respect to
moderate attenuation, and persists in a regime where Fock encodings with up to
two-photon states are also suboptimal. Finally, we show that the use of part of
the energy to establish a reference frame is sub-optimal even at large
energies. Our results represent a key departure from the case of
phase-covariant Gaussian channels and constitute a proof-of-principle of the
advantages of using non-classical, squeezed light in a motivated communication

challenging because of the huge gap between the source and target domain. A
typical self-training method is to use pseudo-labels generated by clustering
algorithms to iteratively optimize the model on the target domain. However, a
drawback to this is that noisy pseudo-labels generally cause trouble in
learning. To address this problem, a mutual learning method by dual networks
has been developed to produce reliable soft labels. However, as the two neural
networks gradually converge, their complementarity is weakened and they likely
become biased towards the same kind of noise. This paper proposes a novel
light-weight module, the Attentive WaveBlock (AWB), which can be integrated
into the dual networks of mutual learning to enhance the complementarity and
further depress noise in the pseudo-labels. Specifically, we first introduce a
parameter-free module, the WaveBlock, which creates a difference between
features learned by two networks by waving blocks of feature maps differently.
Then, an attention mechanism is leveraged to enlarge the difference created and
discover more complementary features. Furthermore, two kinds of combination
strategies, i.e. pre-attention and post-attention, are explored. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance with
significant improvements on multiple UDA person re-identification tasks. We
also prove the generality of the proposed method by applying it to vehicle

schemes have the drawback of taking into account only the signal strength from

the expected Quality of Experience (QoE) resulting from the decision of target
cell to handover to, should be the driving principle of the handover decision.
In particular, we propose two models based on multi-layer many-to-one LSTM
architecture, and a multi-layer LSTM AutoEncoder (AE) in conjunction with a
MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network. We show that using experience
extracted from data, we can improve the number of users finalizing the download

from spectra typically fit for a single star, but we know that up to half of
all exoplanet host stars may have one or more companion stars. We use
high-resolution spectra of planet host stars in the Kepler field from the
California-Kepler Survey to create simulated binaries; we select 8 stellar
pairs and vary the contribution of the secondary star, then determine stellar
parameters with SpecMatch-Emp and compare them to the parameters derived for
the primary star alone. We find that in most cases the effective temperature,
surface gravity, metallicity, and stellar radius derived from the composite
spectrum are within 2-3 $\sigma$ of the values determined from the unblended
spectrum, but the deviations depend on the properties of the two stars.
Relatively bright companion stars that are similar to the primary star have the
largest effect on the derived parameters; in these cases the stellar radii can
be overestimated by up to 60%. We find that metallicities are generally
underestimated, with values up to 8 times smaller than the typical uncertainty
in [Fe/H]. Our study shows that follow-up observations are necessary to detect

simultaneous excitation of more than one Rydberg atoms, by off-resonant laser
excitation, causing an excitation antiblockade. Rydberg antiblockade gives rise
to strongly correlated many-body dynamics and spin-orbit coupling, and also

Effective Hamiltonian governing underlying antiblockade dynamics is derived. We

algorithms, a rich methodological literature, and strong theoretical grounding.
However, due to their prohibitive computation and storage demands, the use of
exact GPs in Bayesian models is limited to problems containing at most several
thousand observations. Sampling requires matrix operations that scale at
$\mathcal{O}(n^3),$ where $n$ is the number of unique inputs. Storage of
individual matrices scales at $\mathcal{O}(n^2),$ and can quickly overwhelm the
resources of most modern computers. To overcome these bottlenecks, we develop a
sampling algorithm using $\mathcal{H}$ matrix approximation of the matrices
comprising the GP posterior covariance. These matrices can approximate the true
conditional covariance matrix within machine precision and allow for sampling
algorithms that scale at $\mathcal{O}(n \ \mbox{log}^2 n)$ time and storage
demands scaling at $\mathcal{O}(n \ \mbox{log} \ n).$ We also describe how
these algorithms can be used as building blocks to model higher dimensional
surfaces at $\mathcal{O}(d \ n \ \mbox{log}^2 n)$, where $d$ is the dimension
of the surface under consideration, using tensor products of one-dimensional
GPs. Though various scalable processes have been proposed for approximating
Bayesian GP inference when $n$ is large, to our knowledge, none of these
methods show that the approximation's Kullback-Leibler divergence to the true
posterior can be made arbitrarily small and may be no worse than the
approximation provided by finite computer arithmetic. We describe
$\mathcal{H}-$matrices, give an efficient Gibbs sampler using these matrices
for one-dimensional GPs, offer a proposed extension to higher dimensional
surfaces, and investigate the performance of this fast increased fidelity
approximate GP, FIFA-GP, using both simulated and real data sets.

of pair-copula constructions underlined by numerous publications in the last
decade, in this contribution we tackle the unavoidable question on how flexible
and simplifying the commonly used `simplifying assumption' is from an analytic
perspective and provide answers to two related open questions posed by Nagler
and Czado in 2016. Aiming at a simplest possible setup for deriving the main
results we first focus on the three-dimensional setting. We prove that the
family of simplified copulas is flexible in the sense that it is dense in the
set of all three-dimensional co\-pulas with respect to the uniform metric
$d_\infty$ - considering stronger notions of convergence like the one induced
by the metric $D_1$, by weak conditional convergence, by total variation, or by
Kullback-Leibler divergence, however, the family even turn out to be nowhere
dense and hence insufficient for any kind of flexible approximation.
Furthermore, returning to $d_\infty$ we show that the partial vine copula is
never the optimal simplified copula approximation of a given, non-simplified
copula $C$, and derive examples illustrating that the corresponding
approximation error can be strikingly large and extend to more than 28\% of the
diameter of the metric space. Moreover, the mapping $\psi$ assigning each
three-dimensional copula its unique partial vine copula turns out to be
discontinuous with respect to $d_\infty$ (but continuous with respect to $D_1$
and to weak conditional convergence), implying a surprising sensitivity of
partial vine copula approximations. The afore-mentioned main results concerning
$d_\infty$ are then extended to the general multivariate setting.

agent-based simulation experiments suggest that with these, majorities cannot

all pathways along which information can be transmitted in the network. In this
representation, we find remarkable symmetries in the input trees that
deconstruct the network into functional building blocks called fibers. Nodes in
a fiber have isomorphic input trees and thus process equivalent dynamics and
synchronize their activity. Each fiber can then be collapsed into a single
representative base node through an information-preserving transformation
called 'symmetry fibration', introduced by Grothendieck in the context of
algebraic geometry. We exemplify the symmetry fibrations in gene regulatory
networks and then show that they universally apply across species and domains
from biology to social and infrastructure networks. The building blocks are
classified into topological classes of input trees characterized by integer
branching ratios and fractal golden ratios of Fibonacci sequences representing
cycles of information. Thus, symmetry fibrations describe how complex networks
are built from the bottom up to process information through the synchronization
of their constitutive building blocks.

has been strongly refuted on the strength of four decades of observation and
analysis, in favour of recombination at a redshift z ~ 1080. But tension with
the data is growing in several other areas, including measurements of the
Hubble constant H(z) and the BAO scale, which directly or indirectly impact the
physics at the surface of last scattering (LSS). The R_h=ct universe resolves
at least some of this tension. We show in this paper that---if the BAO scale is
in fact equal to the acoustic horizon---the redshift of the LSS in this
cosmology is z_cmb ~ 16, placing it within the era of Pop III star formation,
prior to the epoch of reionization at 15 > z > 6. Quite remarkably, the
measured values of z_cmb and H_0 = H(0) in this model are sufficient to argue
that the CMB temperature today ought to be ~ 3 K, so H_0 and the baryon to
photon ratio are not independent free parameters. This scenario might have
resulted from rethermalization of the CMB photons by dust, presumably supplied
to the interstellar medium by the ejecta of Pop III stars. Dust
rethermalization may therefore yet resurface as a relevant ingredient in the
R_h=ct universe. Upcoming high sensitivity instruments should be able to
readily distinguish between the recombination and dust scenarios by either (i)
detecting recombination lines at z ~ 1080, or (ii) establishing a robust
frequency-dependent variation of the CMB power spectrum at the level of ~ 2-4%
across the sampled frequency range.

also seen that all the solutions of Einstein's field equations are still

also think that the parameter $\alpha \equiv 1/k^2$ as coupling constant

well the neutron star radius can be reconstructed using the gravitational-wave
only observations of tidal deformability, i.e. quantities which are not related
in a straightforward way. Methods: Application of artificial neural network in
the equation of state reconstruction exploits the non-linear potential of this
machine learning model. Since each neuron in the network is basically a
non-linear function, it is possible to create a complex mapping between the
input sets of observations and the output equation of state table. Within the
supervised training paradigm, we construct a few hidden layer deep neural
network on a generated data set, consisting of a realistic equation of state
for the neutron star crust connected with a piecewise relativistic polytropes
dense core, with parameters representative to the state-of-the art realistic
equations of state. Results: We demonstrate the performance of our machine
learning implementation with respect to the simulated cases with varying number
of observations and measurement uncertainties. Furthermore we study the impact
of the neutron star mass distributions on the results. Finally, we test the
reconstruction of the equation of state trained on parametric polytropic
training set using the simulated mass--radius and mass--tidal-deformability
sequences based on realistic equations of state. Neural networks trained with a
limited data set are able to generalize the mapping between global parameters
and equation of state input tables for realistic models.

combining internal and external validation measures in a structured manner, we
were able to evaluate clustering structures based on the utility they present

the latter -- to a fraction of the network nodes. This sequential aspect in the

making this work the first to cast the dynamic control problem as a series of
sequential selection problems. Through in-depth SIS epidemic simulations we
compare the performance of our multi-round approach with other resource

overcome historical limitations on the magnification and field of view (FOV)

analogy (involving operators on Hilbert space with commutators scaled by
Planck's constant $\hbar$) not only gives the algebraic structure but also
dictates the average values of physical quantities in the quantum ground state.
On the other hand, the Poisson brackets of nonrelativistic mechanics, which
give only the classical canonical transformations, do not give any values for
physical quantities. Rather, one must go outside nonrelativistic classical
mechanics in order to obtain a fundamental phase space distribution for
classical physics. We assume that the values of physical quantities in
classical theory at any temperature depend on the phase space probability
distribution which arises from thermal radiation equilibrium including
classical zero-point radiation with the scale set by Planck's constant $\hbar$.
All mechanical systems in thermal radiation will inherit the constant $\hbar$

stochastic nature of the optimizer enables the uncertainty quantification of

decades for modeling solid mechanics problems via solving governing partial
differential equations (PDEs). A salient aspect that distinguishes these
numerical methods is how they approximate the physical fields of interest.
Physics-informed deep learning is a novel approach recently developed for
modeling PDE solutions and shows promise to solve computational mechanics
problems without using any labeled data. The philosophy behind it is to
approximate the quantity of interest (e.g., PDE solution variables) by a deep
neural network (DNN) and embed the physical law to regularize the network. To
this end, training the network is equivalent to minimization of a well-designed
loss function that contains the PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions
(I/BCs). In this paper, we present a physics-informed neural network (PINN)
with mixed-variable output to model elastodynamics problems without resort to
labeled data, in which the I/BCs are hardly imposed. In particular, both the
displacement and stress components are taken as the DNN output, inspired by the
hybrid finite element analysis, which largely improves the accuracy and
trainability of the network. Since the conventional PINN framework augments all
the residual loss components in a ""soft"" manner with Lagrange multipliers, the
weakly imposed I/BCs cannot not be well satisfied especially when complex I/BCs
are present. To overcome this issue, a composite scheme of DNNs is established
based on multiple single DNNs such that the I/BCs can be satisfied forcibly in
a ""hard"" manner. The propose PINN framework is demonstrated on several
numerical elasticity examples with different I/BCs, including both static and
dynamic problems as well as wave propagation in truncated domains. Results show
the promise of PINN in the context of computational mechanics applications.

  Deep Neural Network Framework: The Case of Remaining Useful Life Prognosis","7 pages. 5 figures. Submitted to RAMS conference",,,,"eess.SP cs.CE cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Deep learning (DL) has become an essential tool in prognosis and health
management (PHM), commonly used as a regression algorithm for the prognosis of
a system's behavior. One particular metric of interest is the remaining useful
life (RUL) estimated using monitoring sensor data. Most of these deep learning
applications treat the algorithms as black-box functions, giving little to no
control of the data interpretation. This becomes an issue if the models break
the governing laws of physics or other natural sciences when no constraints are
imposed. The latest research efforts have focused on applying complex DL models
to achieve a low prediction error rather than studying how the models interpret
the behavior of the data and the system itself. In this paper, we propose an
open-box approach using a deep neural network framework to explore the physics
of degradation through partial differential equations (PDEs). The framework has
three stages, and it aims to discover a latent variable and corresponding PDE
to represent the health state of the system. Models are trained as a supervised
regression and designed to output the RUL as well as a latent variable map that
can be used and interpreted as the system's health indicator.

paramount of interest to the farmers for preventive measures and decrease the
yield loss through necessary remedial actions. Due to the vast agricultural
field, manual inspection of crops is tedious and time-consuming. UAV based data
collection, observation, identification, and quantification of defected leaves
area are considered to be an effective solution. The present work attempts to
estimate the percentage of affected groundnut leaves area across four regions
of Andharapradesh using image processing techniques. The proposed method
involves colour space transformation combined with thresholding technique to
perform the segmentation. The calibration measures are performed during
acquisition with respect to UAV capturing distance, angle and other relevant
camera parameters. Finally, our method can estimate the consolidated leaves and
defected area. The image analysis results across these four regions reveal that
around 14 - 28% of leaves area is affected across the groundnut field and
thereby yield will be diminished correspondingly. Hence, it is recommended to
spray the pesticides on the affected regions alone across the field to improve
the plant growth and thereby yield will be increased.

to adapt their behavior to their interlocutors. One key aspect of this is
generation of appropriate non-verbal behavior for the agent, for example facial
gestures, here defined as facial expressions and head movements. Most existing
gesture-generating systems do not utilize multi-modal cues from the
interlocutor when synthesizing non-verbal behavior. Those that do, typically
use deterministic methods that risk producing repetitive and non-vivid motions.
In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic method to synthesize
interlocutor-aware facial gestures - represented by highly expressive FLAME
parameters - in dyadic conversations. Our contributions are: a) a method for
feature extraction from multi-party video and speech recordings, resulting in a
representation that allows for independent control and manipulation of
expression and speech articulation in a 3D avatar; b) an extension to MoGlow, a
recent motion-synthesis method based on normalizing flows, to also take
multi-modal signals from the interlocutor as input and subsequently output
interlocutor-aware facial gestures; and c) a subjective evaluation assessing
the use and relative importance of the input modalities. The results show that
the model successfully leverages the input from the interlocutor to generate
more appropriate behavior. Videos, data, and code available at:

propagate with constant velocity and shape. In mechanics, they hold the
potential to control locomotion, mitigate shocks and transfer information,
among other functionalities. Recently, such elastic waves were numerically
observed in compressible rubber-like laminates. Here, we conduct numerical
experiments to characterize the possible vector solitary waves in these
laminates, and expose a new type of waves whose amplitude and velocity
oscillate periodically without dispersing in time. This oscillation is a
manifestation of a periodic transfer of energy between the two wave
polarizations, which we consider as internal mode of the solitary wave. We find
that the vector solitary waves propagate faster at higher amplitudes, and
determine a lower bound for their velocity. We describe a procedure for
identifying which initial strains generate such vector solitary waves. This
procedure also enables an additional classification between tensile and
compressive solitary waves, according to the way that the axial strain changes
as the waves propagate.

contained untangled object identity and properties information that could be
accurately extracted via high-level cortices or even a simple weighted
summation decoder. In the learning and forgetting study, novel structure
recognition is implemented by adjusting entire synapses in low magnitude while
pattern specificities of original synaptic connectivity are preserved, which
guaranteed a learning process without disrupting the existing functionalities.

leaky/resonant modes that remain however highly localized. They have attracted
much attention in Optics and Photonics, and especially in metasurfaces, i.e.
planar arrays of sub-wavelength meta-atoms. One of their most outstanding
feature is the arbitrarily large Q-factors they induce upon approaching the BIC
condition, which we exploit here to achieve a narrow transparency band. We
first show how to shift a canonical BIC in an all-dielectric metasurface,
consisting of high-refractive disks exhibiting in- and out-of-plane magnetic
dipole (MD) resonances, by tuning the periodicity of the array. By means of our
coupled electric/magnetic dipole formulation, we show analytically that when
the quasi-BIC overlaps with the broad (in-plane MD) resonance, a full
transparency band emerges with diverging Q-factor upon approaching the BIC
condition in parameter space. Finally, our experimental measurements in the
microwave regime with a large array of high-refractive-index disks confirm the
theoretical predictions. Our results reveal a simple mechanism to engineer an
ultra-narrow BIC-induced transparency band that could be exploited throughout
the electromagnetic spectrum with obvious applications in filtering and

technique is formulated to analyse the alkali-silica reaction-induced damage in

the reaction extent at the meso-scale. At the meso-scale level, concrete is
considered as a heterogeneous material consisting of aggregates embedded in a
mortar matrix. The mechanical effects of the Alkali-Silica Reaction (ASR) are
modelled through the application of temperature-dependent eigenstrains in
several localised spots inside the aggregates and the mechanical degradation of
concrete is modelled using continuous damage model, which is capable of
reproducing the complex ASR crack networks. Then, the effective stiffness
tensor and the effective stress tensor for each macroscopic finite element are
computed by homogenising the mechanical response of the corresponding
representative volume element (RVE), thus avoiding the use of phenomenological
constitutive laws at the macro-scale. Convergence between macro- and
meso-scales is achieved via an iterative procedure. A 2D model of an ASR
laboratory specimen is analysed as a proof of concept. The model is able to
account for the loading applied at the macro-scale and the ASR-product
expansion at the meso-scale. The results demonstrate that the macroscopic
stress state influences the orientation of damage inside the underlying RVEs.
The effective stiffness becomes anisotropic in cases where damage is aligned
inside the RVE.

bi-level graph, where the highest level graph represents the interaction
between biological entities (interaction graph), and each biological entity
itself is further expanded to its intrinsic graph representation
(representation graphs), where the graph is either flat like a drug compound or
hierarchical like a protein with amino acid level graph, secondary structure,

from both the high-level interaction graph and the low-level representation
graphs, but also offers a baseline for future research opportunities to address

systems, especially when the time difference $\Delta t$ between consecutive
steps is so large that a trivial, ergodic local minimum would most likely be
reached instead. Here, we introduce a new long-short-term-memory (LSTM)-based
recurrent architecture by tensorizing the cell-state-to-state propagation
therein, keeping the long-term memory feature of LSTM while simultaneously
enhancing the learning of short-term nonlinear complexity. We stress that the
global minima of chaos can be most efficiently reached by tensorization where
all nonlinear terms, up to some polynomial order, are treated explicitly and
weighted equally. The efficiency and generality of our architecture are
systematically tested and confirmed by theoretical analysis and experimental
results. In our design, we have explicitly used two different many-body
entanglement structures---matrix product states (MPS) and the multiscale
entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA)---as physics-inspired tensor
decomposition techniques, from which we find that MERA generally performs
better than MPS, hence conjecturing that the learnability of chaos is
determined not only by the number of free parameters but also the tensor
complexity---recognized as how entanglement entropy scales with varying
