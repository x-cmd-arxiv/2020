universal conditions except for the Higgs sector. It can not only keep the
simpleness and grace of the fully constrained MSSM and NMSSM, and relax the
tension that they face after the 125-GeV Higgs boson discovered, but also
predict an exotic phenomenon that Higgs decay to a pair of light
singlet-dominated scalars ($10\!\sim\! 60\;{\rm GeV}$). This condition can be
classified to three scenarios according to the identities of the SM-like Higgs
and the light scalar: (i) the light scalar is CP-odd, and the SM-like Higgs is
$h_2$; (ii) the light scalar is CP-odd, and the SM-like Higgs is $h_1$; (iii)
the light scalar is CP-even, and the SM-like Higgs is $h_2$. In this work, we
compare the three scenarios, checking the interesting parameter schemes that
lead to the scenarios, the mixing levels of the doublets and singlets, the
tri-scalar coupling between the SM-like Higgs and a pair of light scalars, the
branching ratio of Higgs decay to the light scalars, and sensitivities in
hunting for the exotic decay at the HL-LHC and the future lepton colliders such

of low-curvature Taylor--Couette (TC) flow in the vicinity of the ultimate

Non-dimensional shear drivings (Taylor numbers $\text{Ta}$) in the range
$10^7\leq\text{Ta}\leq10^{11}$ are explored for both co- and counter-rotating
configurations. In the $\text{Ta}$ range $10^8\leq\text{Ta}\leq10^{10}$, we
observe two local maxima of the angular momentum transport as a function of the
cylinder rotation ratio, which can be described as either as ""co-"" and
""counter-rotating"" due to their location or as ""broad"" and ""narrow"" due to
their shape. We confirm that the broad peak is accompanied by the strengthening
of the large-scale structures, and that the narrow peak appears once the
driving (Ta) is strong enough. As first evidenced in numerical simulations by
Brauckmann \emph{et al.}~(2016), the broad peak is produced by centrifugal
instabilities and that the narrow peak is a consequence of shear instabilities.
We describe how the peaks change with $\text{Ta}$ as the flow becomes more
turbulent. Close to the transition to the ultimate regime when the boundary
layers (BLs) become turbulent, the usual structure of counter-rotating Taylor
vortex pairs breaks down and stable unpaired rolls appear locally. We attribute
this state to changes in the underlying roll characteristics during the
transition to the ultimate regime. Further changes in the flow structure around
$\text{Ta}\approx10^{10}$ cause the broad peak to disappear completely and the
narrow peak to move. This second transition is caused when the regions inside
the BLs which are locally smooth regions disappear and the whole boundary layer
becomes active.

Here we show how to cast classical spin Hamiltonians as formal languages, and

(effectively) zero-dimensional spin Hamiltonians is regular, one-dimensional
spin Hamiltonians is deterministic context-free, and higher-dimensional and
all-to-all spin Hamiltonians is context-sensitive. This provides a new
complexity measure for classical spin Hamiltonians, which captures the hardness
of recognizing spin configurations and their energies. We compare it to the
computational complexity of the ground state energy problem, and find a
different easy-to-hard threshold for the Ising model. We also investigate the
dependence of the measure on the language of the spin Hamiltonian, and initiate
the characterization of its freedom. Finally, we define the language of the
time evolution of a spin Hamiltonian and also classify it in the Chomsky

we bias the dynamics, at trajectory level, by a parameter conjugated to the
current, within the large-deviation formalism. We investigate, in the
weak-noise limit, the phase diagram spanned by the physical driving force and
the parameter defining the biased process. We focus in particular on the
depinning transition in this two-dimensional phase diagram. In the absence of
trajectory bias, the depinning transition as a function of the force is
characterized by the standard exponent $\frac{1}{2}$. We show that for any
non-zero bias, the depinning transition is characterized by an inverse
logarithmic behavior as a function of either the bias or the force, close to
the critical lines. We also report a scaling exponent $\frac{1}{3}$ for the
current when considering the depinning transition in terms of the bias, fixing
the non-conservative force to its critical value in the absence of bias. Then,
focusing on the time-integrated particle current, we study the thermal rounding
effects in the zero-current phase when the tilted potential exhibits a local
minimum. We derive in this case the Arrhenius scaling, in the small noise
limit, of both the particle current and the scaled cumulant generating

Ergodic exploration enables robotic systems to indirectly sample from
informative spatial distributions globally, avoiding local optima, and without
the need to evaluate the derivatives of the distribution against the robot
dynamics. Using hybrid systems theory, we derive a controller that allows a
robot to exploit equilibrium policies (i.e., policies that solve a task) while
allowing the robot to explore and generate informative data using an ergodic
measure that can extend to high-dimensional states. We show that our method is
able to maintain Lyapunov attractiveness with respect to the equilibrium task
while actively generating data for learning tasks such, as Bayesian
optimization, model learning, and off-policy reinforcement learning. In each

illustrate these examples using simulated systems and provide simplification of

bosonic system, one deals with spectral degeneracies of a non-Hermitian
Hamiltonian (NHH), which can correctly describe the system dynamics only in the
semiclassical regime. A recently proposed quantum Liouvillian framework enables
to completely determine the dynamical properties of such systems and their EPs
(referred to as Liouvillian EPs, or LEPs) in the quantum regime by taking into
account the effects of quantum jumps, which are ignored in the NHH formalism.
Moreover, the symmetry and eigenfrequency spectrum of the NHH become a part of
much larger Liouvillian eigenspace. As such, the EPs of an NHH form a subspace
of the LEPs. Here we show that once an NHH of a dissipative linear bosonic
system exhibits an EP of a certain finite order $n$, it immediately implies
that the corresponding LEP can become of any higher order $m\geq n$, defined in
the infinite Hilbert space. Most importantly, these higher-order LEPs can be
identified by the coherence and spectral functions at the steady state. The
coherence functions can offer a convenient tool to probe extreme system
sensitivity to external perturbations in the vicinity of higher-order LEPs. As
an example, we study a linear bosonic system of a bimodal cavity with
incoherent mode coupling to reveal its higher-order LEPs; particularly, of
second and third order via first- and second-order coherence functions,
respectively. Accordingly, these LEPs can be additionally revealed by squared
and cubic Lorentzian spectral lineshapes in the power and intensity-fluctuation
spectra. Moreover, we demonstrate that these EPs can also be associated with
spontaneous parity-time (${\cal PT}$) and anti-${\cal PT}$-symmetry breaking in
the system studied.

u\colon\mathbb{R}^N\to \mathbb{R}, \] where $x=(y,z)\in \mathbb{R}^K\times
\mathbb{R}^{N-K}$, $N>K\geq 2$, $r=|y|$ and $a>a_0\in(-\infty,0]$. In the
critical case, the multiplicity problem for the latter equation has been
studied only in the autonomous case $a=0$ and the available methods seem to be
insufficient for the problem involving the singular potential, i.e. $a\neq 0$,
due to the lack of conformal invariance. Therefore we develop methods for the
critical curl-curl problem and show the multiplicity of bound states for both
equations in the case $N=3$, $K=2$ and $a=1$. In the subcritical case, instead,
applying a critical point theory to the Schr\""odinger equation above, we find
infinitely many bound states for both problems.

resilient technique for their malicious servers while keeping them hidden from
direct access. In this technique, a large number of botnet machines, that are
known as flux agents, work as proxies to relay the traffic between end users
and a malicious mothership server which is controlled by an adversary. Various
mechanisms have been proposed for detecting FFSNs. Such mechanisms depend on
collecting a large amount of DNS traffic traces and require a considerable
amount of time to identify fast flux domains. In this paper, we propose an
efficient AI-based online fast flux detection system that performs highly
accurate and extremely fast detection of fast flux domains. The proposed
system, called PASSVM, is based on features that are associated with DNS
response messages of a given domain name. The approach relies on features that
are stored in two local databases, in addition to features that are extracted
from the response DNS messages itself. The information in the databases are
obtained from Censys search engine and IP Geolocation service. PASSVM is
evaluated using three types of artificial neural networks which are: Multilayer
Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function Network (RBF), and Support Vector
Machines (SVM). Results show that SVM with RBF kernel outperformed the other
two methods with an accuracy of 99.557% and a detection time of less than 18
ms.

race between wireless security and channel attacks. Traditional cryptography
requires high-computational power and is not suitable for low-power IoT
scenarios. Whist, recently developed physical layer security (PLS) can exploit
common wireless channel state information (CSI), its sensitivity to channel
estimation makes them vulnerable from attacks. In this work, we exploit an
alternative common physics shared between IoT transceivers: the monitored
channel-irrelevant physical networked dynamics (e.g., water/oil/gas/electrical
signal-flows). Leveraging this, we propose for the first time, graph layer
security (GLS), by exploiting the dependency in physical dynamics among network
nodes for information encryption and decryption. A graph Fourier transform
(GFT) operator is used to characterize such dependency into a graph-bandlimted
subspace, which allows the generations of channel-irrelevant cipher keys by
maximizing the secrecy rate. We evaluate our GLS against designed active and
passive attackers, using IEEE 39-Bus system. Results demonstrate that, GLS is
not reliant on wireless CSI, and can combat attackers that have partial
networked dynamic knowledge (realistic access to full dynamic and critical
nodes remains challenging). We believe this novel GLS has widespread
applicability in secure health monitoring and for Digital Twins in adversarial
radio environments.

much interest since CDWs have been discovered in many cuprates superconductors.
Here we show that disorder induced by proton irradiation is a full-fledged
tuning parameter that can bring essential information to answer this question
as it affects CDW and superconductivity with different and unequivocal
mechanisms. Specifically, in the model CDW superconductor Lu$_5$Ir$_4$Si$_{10}$

show that disorder enhances the superconducting critical temperature
$T_\mathrm{c}$ and $H_\mathrm{c2}$ while it suppresses the CDW. Discussing how
disorder affects both superconductivity and the CDW, we make a compelling case
that superconductivity and CDW are competing for electronic density of states
at the Fermi level in Lu$_5$Ir$_4$Si$_{10}$, and we reconcile the results
obtained via the more common tuning parameters of pressure and doping. Owing to
its prototypical, 1D, Peierls type CDW and the s-wave, weak-coupling nature of

radial velocity variations of 5km/s, over timescales of three months. The best
explanation for the eclipse is the presence of a companion on an eccentric
orbit. The observations constrain the eccentricity to e>0.5, the period to
P>70d, and the mass of the companion to ~0.001-0.04Msol. In principle it is
also possible that the eclipse is caused by circum-sub-stellar material. Future

Standard viewpoint estimation approaches generally fail on this task due to
their reliance on a 3D model for alignment or large amounts of class-specific
training data and their corresponding canonical pose. We overcome those
limitations by learning a reconstruct and align approach. Our key insight is
that although we do not have an explicit 3D model or a predefined canonical
pose, we can still learn to estimate the object's shape in the viewer's frame
and then use an image to provide our reference model or canonical pose. In
particular, we propose learning two networks: the first maps images to a 3D
geometry-aware feature bottleneck and is trained via an image-to-image
translation loss; the second learns whether two instances of features are
aligned. At test time, our model finds the relative transformation that best
aligns the bottleneck features of our test image to a reference image. We
evaluate our method on novel object viewpoint estimation by generalizing across
different datasets, analyzing the impact of our different modules, and
providing a qualitative analysis of the learned features to identify what
representations are being learnt for alignment.

However, their progenitors and explosion mechanism have not been understood
yet. It has been suggested that SNe Iax may be produced from weak deflagration
explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarfs (WDs) in binary systems with a
helium (He) star donor. In such progenitor systems, the stripped He companion
material caused by the ejecta-companion interaction is expected to present some
He features in their late-time spectra. However, the detection of He lines in
late-time spectra of SNe Iax has not yet been successful, which gives an upper
limit on the amount of stripped He mass of < 0.002-0.1 solar masses. In this
work, we study the interaction between SN Iax ejecta and a He star companion by
performing three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with a weak pure
deflagration explosion model. We find that about 0.004 solar masses of He
material can be stripped off from the companion star by SN explosion, which is
very close to (or lower than) the observational upper-limit on the total
stripped He mass in SNe Iax. We, therefore, conclude that non-detection of He
lines in late-time spectra of SNe Iax could be reasonably explained if they are
indeed resulted from weak pure deflagration explosions of Chandrasekhar-mass
WDs in progenitor systems with a He star donor.

through spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. However, the technique
rests on assumptions such as the galaxy star formation history and dust
attenuation law that can severely impact the accuracy of derived physical
properties from SED modeling. Here, we examine the effect that the assumed star
formation history (SFH) has on the stellar properties inferred from SED fitting
by ground truthing them against mock observations of high-resolution
cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations. Classically, SFHs are
modeled with simplified parameterized functional forms, but these forms are
unlikely to capture the true diversity of galaxy SFHs and may impose systematic
biases with under-reported uncertainties on results. We demonstrate that
flexible nonparametric star formation histories outperform traditional
parametric forms in capturing variations in galaxy star formation histories,
and as a result, lead to significantly improved stellar masses in SED fitting.
We find a decrease in the average bias of 0.4 dex with a delayed-$\tau$ model
to a bias of just under 0.05 dex for the nonparametric model. Similarly, using
nonparametric star formation histories in SED fitting result in increased
accuracy in recovered galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar ages.

becomes increasingly appealing to start analysing stellar actions and angles,
which specifically label orbit space, instead of their current phase space
location. Conceptually, while $\bar{x}$ and $\bar{v}$ tell us about the
potential and local interactions, grouping in action puts together stars that
have similar frequencies and hence similar responses to dynamical effects
occurring over several orbits. Grouping in actions and angles refines this
further to isolate stars which are travelling together through space and hence
have shared histories. Mixing these coordinate systems can confuse the
interpretation. For example, it has been suggested that by moving stars to
their guiding radius, the Milky Way spiral structure is visible as ridge-like
overdensities in the $Gaia$ data \citep{Khoperskov+19b}. However, in this work,
we show that these features are in fact the known kinematic moving groups, both
in the $L_z-\phi$ and the $v_{\mathrm{R}}-v_{\phi}$ planes. Using simulations
we show how this distinction will become even more important as we move to a
global view of the Milky Way. As an example, we show that the radial velocity
wave seen in the Galactic disc in $Gaia$ and APOGEE should become stronger in
the action-angle frame, and that it can be reproduced by transient spiral
structure.

been the subject of some dispute. Its uncertainty propagates as a systematic
error for methods which measure the extragalactic distance scale through
knowledge of the absolute extinction of LMC stars. In an effort to resolve this
issue, we used three different methods to calibrate the most widely-used metric
to predict LMC extinction, the intrinsic color of the red clump,
$(V-I)_{RC,0}$, for the inner $\sim$3 degrees of that galaxy. The first
approach was to empirically calibrate the color zeropoints of the BaSTI
isochrones over a wide metallicity range of ${\Delta}\rm{[Fe/H]} \approx 1.10$
using measurements of red clump stars in 47 Tuc, the Solar Neighborhood, and
NGC 6791.
  From these efforts we also measure these properties of the Solar Neighborhood

$H-K_{s}$, $M_{I}$, $M_{Ks}$)$_{RC,0} =$ (1.02, 2.75, 2.18, 1.52, 0.64, 0.15,
$-$0.23, $-$1.63). The second and third methods were to compare the observed
colors of the red clump to those of Cepheids and RR Lyrae in the LMC. With
these three methods, we estimated the intrinsic color of the red clump of the
LMC to be $(V-I)_{RC,0,\rm{LMC}} = \{ \approx 0.93,0.91 \pm 0.02,0.89 \pm
0.02\}$ respectively, and similarly using the first and third method we
estimated $ (V-I)_{RC,0,\rm{SMC}} = \{\approx 0.85,0.84 \pm 0.02 \}$
respectively for the Small Magellanic Cloud. We estimate the luminosities to be
$M_{I,RC,\rm{LMC}}=-0.26$ and $M_{I,RC,\rm{SMC}}=-0.37$. We show that this has
important implications for recent calibrations of the tip of the red giant

many molecules, raising the question of how important the extended crystalline
nature is. Using accurate Green's function based methods for the electronic
structure and non-perturbative finite difference methods for exciton-vibration
coupling, we describe exciton interactions with molecular and crystal degrees
of freedom concurrently. We find that the degree of exciton delocalization
controls these interactions, with thermally activated crystal phonons
predominantly coupling to delocalized states, and molecular quantum
fluctuations predominantly coupling to localized states. Based on this picture,
we quantitatively predict and interpret the temperature and pressure dependence
of excitonic peaks in the acene series of organic semiconductors, which we
confirm experimentally, and we develop a simple experimental protocol for
probing exciton delocalization. Overall, we provide a unified picture of

the system. In this paper, we investigate anomalous dielectric response caused
by such states caused by the pi Zak phase. First, by using the one-dimensional
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we show that, when the system is insulating and the
Zak phase is pi, the polarization suddenly rises to a large value close to e/2,
by application of an external electric field. The pi Zak phase indicates
existence of half-filled edge states, and we attribute this phenomenon to
charge transfer between the edge states at the two ends of the system. We
extend this idea to two- and three-dimensional insulators with the pi Zak phase
over the Brillouin zone, and find similar anomalous dielectric response. We
also show that diamond and silicon slabs with (111) surfaces have the pi Zak
phase by ab intio calculations, and show that this anomalous response survives
even surface reconstruction involving an odd number of original surface unit
cells. Another material example with an anomalous dielectric response is
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), showing plateaus of polarization at +e by ab
initio calculation, in agreement with our theory.

that of radiation, providing us with motivation to consider scenarios in which
the early universe contained a significant abundance of such objects. In this
study, we revisit the constraints on primordial black holes derived from
measurements of the light element abundances. Black holes and their Hawking
evaporation products can impact the era of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) by
altering the rate of expansion at the time of neutron-proton freeze-out, as
well as by radiating mesons which can convert protons into neutrons and vice
versa. Such black holes can thus enhance the primordial neutron-to-proton
ratio, and increase the amount of helium that is ultimately produced.
Additionally, the products of Hawking evaporation can break up helium nuclei,
which both reduces the helium abundance and increases the abundance of
primordial deuterium. Building upon previous work, we make use of modern
deuterium and helium measurements to derive stringent constraints on black
holes which evaporate in $t_{\rm evap} \sim 10^{-1}$ s to $\sim 10^{13}$ s
(corresponding to $M \sim 6\times 10^8$ g to $\sim 2 \times 10^{13}$ g,
assuming Standard Model particle content). We also consider how physics beyond
the Standard Model could impact these constraints. Due to the gravitational
nature of Hawking evaporation, the rate at which a black hole evaporates, and
the types of particles that are produced through this process, depend on the
complete particle spectrum. Within this context, we discuss scenarios which
feature a large number of decoupled degrees-of-freedom (\ie~large hidden
sectors), as well as models of TeV-scale supersymmetry.

and (2) transference of the ADHD model to a related cohort of Autism Spectrum
Disorder (ASD) patients with an ADHD comorbidity. In total, 240 resting-state
fMRI time series averaged according to three standard parcellation atlases,
along with clinical diagnosis, were released for training and validation (120
neurotypical controls and 120 ADHD). We also provided demographic information
of age, sex, IQ, and handedness. A second set of 100 subjects (50 neurotypical

ranked the methods based on 16 different metrics. The final rank was calculated
using the rank product for each participant across all measures. Furthermore,
we assessed the calibration curves of each method. Five participants submitted
their model for evaluation, with one outperforming all other methods in both

stars, providing a constraint on its star formation timescale as

shortest among $d_n \le n$ randomly selected service queues. We show that when

conditions on the initial queues, the state occupancy process converges in
probability, in a suitable path space, to the unique solution of an infinite
system of constrained ordinary differential equations parametrized by
$\lambda$. Our main interest is in the study of fluctuations of the state
process about its near equilibrium state in the critical regime, namely when
$\lambda_n \to 1$. Previous papers have considered the regime
$\frac{d_n}{\sqrt{n}\log n} \to \infty$ while the objective of the current work
is to develop diffusion approximations for the state occupancy process that
allow for all possible rates of growth of $d_n$. In particular we consider the
three canonical regimes (a) ${d_n}/{\sqrt{n}} \to 0$; (b) ${d_n}/{\sqrt{n}} \to
c\in (0,\infty)$ and, (c) ${d_n}/{\sqrt{n}} \to \infty$. In all three regimes
we show, by establishing suitable functional limit theorems, that (under
conditions on $\lambda_n$) fluctuations of the state process about its near
equilibrium are of order $n^{-1/2}$ and are governed asymptotically by a one
dimensional Brownian motion. The forms of the limit processes in the three
regimes are quite different; in the first case we get a linear diffusion; in
the second case we get a diffusion with an exponential drift; and in the third

training GANs are under-explored compared to CNNs. In this work, we propose a
new GAN architecture for augmentation of chest X-rays for semi-supervised
detection of pneumonia and COVID-19 using generative models. We show that the
proposed GAN can be used to effectively augment data and improve classification
accuracy of disease in chest X-rays for pneumonia and COVID-19. We compare our
augmentation GAN model with Deep Convolutional GAN and traditional augmentation
methods (rotate, zoom, etc) on two different X-ray datasets and show our
GAN-based augmentation method surpasses other augmentation methods for training
a GAN in detecting anomalies in X-ray images.

mathematical and numerical model for wing crack propagation based on linear
elastic fracture mechanics that also accounts for fracture contact mechanics is
presented. Computational efficiency is ensured by an adaptive remeshing

This is addressed by our new framework consisting of the following steps.
First, based on a generative human template, for every two frames having
sufficient overlap, an initial pairwise alignment is performed; It is followed
by a global non-rigid registration procedure, in which partial results from
RGBD frames are collected into a unified 3D shape, under the guidance of

various social and political applications in which sentiment analysis may be
sub-optimal. There has been a growing research interest for developing
effective methods for stance detection methods varying among multiple
communities including natural language processing, web science, and social
computing. This paper surveys the work on stance detection within those
communities and situates its usage within current opinion mining techniques in
social media. It presents an exhaustive review of stance detection techniques
on social media, including the task definition, different types of targets in
stance detection, features set used, and various machine learning approaches
applied. The survey reports state-of-the-art results on the existing benchmark
datasets on stance detection, and discusses the most effective approaches. In
addition, this study explores the emerging trends and different applications of
stance detection on social media. The study concludes by discussing the gaps in
the current existing research and highlights the possible future directions for
stance detection on social media.

can, for instance, help with the detection of genuine outliers or with
benchmarking outlier-detection algorithms. The literature features different
approaches to generate artificial outliers. However, systematic comparison of
these approaches remains absent. This surveys and compares these approaches. We
start by clarifying the terminology in the field, which varies from publication
to publication, and we propose a general problem formulation. Our description
of the connection of generating outliers to other research fields like
experimental design or generative models frames the field of artificial
outliers. Along with offering a concise description, we group the approaches by
their general concepts and how they make use of genuine instances. An extensive
experimental study reveals the differences between the generation approaches
when ultimately being used for outlier detection. This survey shows that the
existing approaches already cover a wide range of concepts underlying the
generation, but also that the field still has potential for further
development. Our experimental study does confirm the expectation that the
quality of the generation approaches varies widely, for example, in terms of
the data set they are used on. Ultimately, to guide the choice of the
generation approach in a specific context, we propose an appropriate
general-decision process. In summary, this survey comprises, describes, and
connects all relevant work regarding the generation of artificial outliers and

achieve impressive deployment efficiency while maintaining the same or better

estimate the impact of access to credit on the overall productivity of rice
farmers, and disentangle the total effect into technological change (frontier
shift) and technical efficiency changes. We find that relative to the baseline
rice output per decimal, access to credit results in, on average, approximately
a 14 percent increase in yield, holding all other inputs constant. After
decomposing the total effect into the frontier shift and efficiency
improvement, we find that, on average, around 11 percent of the increase in

3 percent is attributed to improvements in technical efficiency. The efficiency
gain is higher for modern hybrid rice varieties, and almost zero for
traditional rice varieties. Within the treatment group, the effect is greater

lie close to one another in a common representation space. In this paper, we
propose a method, Filtered Inner Product Projection (FIPP), for mapping

both embeddings and then, only on the common structure, aligns the Gram

even when the source and target embeddings are of differing dimensionalities.
We show that our approach outperforms existing methods on the MUSE dataset for

Recently, learning-based strategies have appeared to be very efficient for
solving inverse problems, by learning direct inversion schemes or plug-and-play
regularizers from available pairs of true states and observations. In this
paper, we go a step further and design an end-to-end framework allowing to
learn actual variational frameworks for inverse problems in such a supervised
setting. The variational cost and the gradient-based solver are both stated as
neural networks using automatic differentiation for the latter. We can jointly
learn both components to minimize the data reconstruction error on the true
states. This leads to a data-driven discovery of variational models. We
consider an application to inverse problems with incomplete datasets (image
inpainting and multivariate time series interpolation). We experimentally
illustrate that this framework can lead to a significant gain in terms of
reconstruction performance, including w.r.t. the direct minimization of the
variational formulation derived from the known generative model.

this paper we propose a new model architecture DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT

two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where
each word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and
position, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed
using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions,
respectively. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to incorporate absolute
positions in the decoding layer to predict the masked tokens in model
pre-training. In addition, a new virtual adversarial training method is used
for fine-tuning to improve models' generalization. We show that these
techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and the
performance of both natural language understanding (NLU) and natural langauge
generation (NLG) downstream tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model
trained on half of the training data performs consistently better on a wide

electrons near the black hole event horizon. Astrometry data show continuous
rotation of the emission region during bright flares, and corresponding
rotation of the linear polarization angle. One broad class of physical flare
models invokes magnetic reconnection. Here we show that such a scenario can
arise in a general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a
magnetically arrested disc. Saturation of magnetic flux triggers eruption
events, where magnetically dominated plasma is expelled from near the horizon
and forms a rotating, spiral structure. Dissipation occurs via reconnection at
the interface of the magnetically dominated plasma and surrounding fluid. This
dissipation is associated with large increases in near-infrared emission in
models of Sgr A*, with durations and amplitudes consistent with the observed
flares. Such events occur at roughly the timescale to re-accumulate the
magnetic flux from the inner accretion disc, 10h for Sgr A*. We study
near-infrared observables from one sample event to show that the emission
morphology tracks the boundary of the magnetically dominated region. As the
region rotates around the black hole, the near-infrared centroid and linear
polarization angle both undergo continuous rotation, similar to the behavior
seen in Sgr A* flares.

tracked infrared flares (IR) at distances of $\sim 10$ gravitational radii
($r_g$). In this paper, we study a model for the flares based on 3D general
relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetically arrested
accretion disks (MADs) which exhibit violent episodes of flux escape from the
black hole magnetosphere. These events are attractive for flare modeling for
several reasons: i) the magnetically dominant regions can resist being
disrupted via magneto-rotational turbulence and shear, ii) the orientation of
the magnetic field is predominantly vertical as suggested by the GRAVITY data,
iii) magnetic reconnection associated with the flux eruptions could yield a
self-consistent means of particle heating/acceleration during the flare events.
In this analysis we track erupted flux bundles and provide distributions of
sizes, energies and plasma parameter. In our simulations, the orbits tend to
circularize at a range of radii from $\sim 5-40 r_g$. The magnetic energy
contained within the flux bundles ranges up to $\sim10^{40}$ erg, enough to
power IR and X-ray flares. We find that the motion within the magnetically
supported flow is substantially sub-Keplerian, in tension with the inferred
period-radius relation of the three GRAVITY flares.

wherein an agent must solve a series of tasks as rapidly as possible in an
unfamiliar environment. An effective RTS agent must balance between exploring
the unfamiliar environment and solving its current task, all while building a
model of the new environment over which it can plan when faced with later
tasks. While modern deep RL agents exhibit some of these abilities in
isolation, none are suitable for the full RTS challenge. To enable progress
toward RTS, we introduce two challenge domains: (1) a minimal RTS challenge
called the Memory&Planning Game and (2) One-Shot StreetLearn Navigation, which
introduces scale and complexity from real-world data. We demonstrate that
state-of-the-art deep RL agents fail at RTS in both domains, and that this
failure is due to an inability to plan over gathered knowledge. We develop
Episodic Planning Networks (EPNs) and show that deep-RL agents with EPNs excel
at RTS, outperforming the nearest baseline by factors of 2-3 and learning to
navigate held-out StreetLearn maps within a single episode. We show that EPNs
learn to execute a value iteration-like planning algorithm and that they

where a mobile entity is allowed to move according to a set of physical
constraints inspired from the pen-and-pencil game Racetrack (also known as
Vector Racer ). In contrast to other versions of TSP accounting for physical
constraints, such as Dubins TSP, the spirit of this model is that (1) no speed
limitations apply, and (2) inertia depends on the current velocity. As such,
this model is closer to typical models considered in path planning problems,
although applied here to the visit of n cities in a non-predetermined order. We
motivate and introduce the VectorTSP problem, discussing fundamental
differences with previous versions of TSP. In particular, an optimal visit
order for ETSP may not be optimal for VTSP. We show that VectorTSP is NP-hard,
and in the other direction, that VectorTSP reduces to GroupTSP in polynomial
time (although with a significant blow-up in size). On the algorithmic side, we
formulate the search for a solution as an interactive scheme between a
high-level algorithm and a trajectory oracle, the former being responsible for
computing the visit order and the latter for computing the cost (or the
trajectory) for a given visit order. We present algorithms for both, and we
demonstrate and quantify through experiments that this approach frequently
finds a better solution than the optimal trajectory realizing an optimal ETSP
tour, which legitimates the problem itself and (we hope) motivates further
algorithmic developments.

1.6 mm, 1.3 mm, and 0.87 mm, respectively). At each band, we measured the
blazar's polarization on an 11$\times$11 grid of evenly-spaced offset pointings
covering the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) area of the primary beam. After
applying calibration solutions derived from the on-axis pointing of 3C 279 to
all of the on- and off-axis data, we find that the residual polarization errors
across the primary beam are similar at all frequencies: the residual errors in
linear polarization fraction $P_\textrm{frac}$ and polarization position angle
$\chi$ are $\lesssim$0.001 ($\lesssim$0.1% of Stokes $I$) and
$\lesssim$1$^\circ$ near the center of the primary beam; the errors increase to
$\sim$0.003-0.005 ($\sim$0.3-0.5% of Stokes $I$) and $\sim$1-5$^\circ$ near the
FWHM as a result of the asymmetric beam patterns in the (linearly polarized)
$Q$ and $U$ maps. We see the expected double-lobed ""beam squint"" pattern in the
circular polarization (Stokes $V$) maps. Second, to test the polarization
accuracy in a typical ALMA project, we performed observations of continuum
linear polarization toward the Kleinmann-Low nebula in Orion (Orion-KL) using
several mosaic patterns at Bands 3 and 6. We show that after mosaicking, the
residual off-axis errors decrease as a result of overlapping multiple

education some of the biggest world issues of the current pandemic.
Unfortunately, due to the length of the incubation period of Covid-19, full
opening of schools seems to be impractical till a vaccine is available. In
order to support the possibility of some in-person learning, we study a
mathematical model of the diffusion of the epidemic due to school opening, and
evaluate plans aimed at containing the extra Covid-19 cases due to school
activities while ensuring an adequate number of in-class learning periods. We
consider a SEAIR model with an external source of infection and a suitable loss
function; after a realistic parameter selection, we numerically determine
optimal school opening strategies by simulated annealing. It turns out that
blended models, with almost periodic alternations of in-class and remote
teaching days or weeks, are generally optimal. Besides containing Covid-19
diffusion, these solutions could be pedagogically acceptable, and could also
become a driving model for the society at large. In a prototypical example, the
optimal strategy results in the school opening 90 days out of 200 with the
number of Covid-19 cases among the individuals related to the school increasing
by about 66%, instead of the about 250% increase that would have been a

well as for linguistically-oriented research. PDT-C 1.0 contains four different
datasets of Czech, uniformly annotated using the standard PDT scheme (albeit
not everything is annotated manually, as we describe in detail here). The texts
come from different sources: daily newspaper articles, Czech translation of the
Wall Street Journal, transcribed dialogs and a small amount of user-generated,
short, often non-standard language segments typed into a web translator.
Altogether, the treebank contains around 180,000 sentences with their
morphological, surface and deep syntactic annotation. The diversity of the
texts and annotations should serve well the NLP applications as well as it is
an invaluable resource for linguistic research, including comparative studies
regarding texts of different genres. The corpus is publicly and freely
available.

disentanglement that only uses the generative model, by measuring the
topological similarity of conditional submanifolds in the learned

non-perturbative access to the equilibrium physics of quantum fields. When
applied to certain fermionic systems, or to the calculation of
out-of-equilibrium physics, these methods encounter the so-called sign problem,
and computational resource requirements become impractically large. These
difficulties prevent the calculation from first principles of the equation of
state of quantum chromodynamics, as well as the computation of transport
coefficients in quantum field theories, among other things.
  This thesis details two methods for mitigating or avoiding the sign problem.
First, via the complexification of the field variables and the application of
Cauchy's integral theorem, the difficulty of the sign problem can be changed.
This requires searching for a suitable contour of integration. Several methods
of finding such a contour are discussed, as well as the procedure for
integrating on it. Two notable examples are highlighted: in one case, a contour
exists which entirely removes the sign problem, and in another, there is
provably no contour available to improve the sign problem by more than a
(parametrically) small amount.
  As an alternative, physical simulations can be performed with the aid of a
quantum computer. The formal elements underlying a quantum computation - that
is, a Hilbert space, unitary operators acting on it, and Hermitian observables
to be measured - can be matched to those of a quantum field theory. In this way
an error-corrected quantum computer may be made to serve as a well controlled
laboratory. Precise algorithms for this task are presented, specifically in the
context of quantum chromodynamics.

(2) for every vertex $u$ in V($D$)$\setminus$$N$ there exists an $H$-path in

means of a partition $\xi$ of $V(H)$ and a partition \{$\xi_1$, $\xi_2$\} of

\xi_{2})$-$H$-subdivisions of $\overrightarrow{C_{3}}$ and $(\xi_{1}, \xi,

major goal of nanophotonics, with potential applications ranging from energy
harvesting to optical information processing. Unfortunately, however, the
resonance lifetime of conventional open resonators remains finite even in the
limit of vanishing material absorption, as a result of radiation loss. In this
context, bound states in the continuum (BiCs) have provided a unique way to
achieve unbounded resonance lifetimes despite the presence of compatible
radiation channels. However, physical constraints such as reciprocity,
linearity, and delay-bandwidth limits prevent the possibility to externally
excite such ideal bound states and make them interact with broadband sources.
Here, we overcome these limitations and theoretically demonstrate that
subwavelength open resonators undergoing a suitable temporal modulation can
efficiently capture a broadband incident wave into a nonradiating eigenmode of
the structure, leading to the first example of a BiC that is accessible to
broadband light. Our findings unveil the dynamic capabilities of bound states

scenario of a small walking group. Our aim is to unveil the main mechanisms
emerging in a human group when leader or follower roles are not designated a
priori. Two groups of participants were asked to walk together and turn or
change speed at self-selected times. Data were analysed using time-dependent
cross correlation to infer leader-follower interactions between each pair of

The representation is canonical in that when applied to a join-closed subbase

minimizing the worst-case error, without recourse to any probabilistic

the worst-case error of any recovery map in finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
Then, for any Hilbert space, we show that Optimal Recovery provides a formula

they can enlarge the filters' receptive field without adding additional weights

do not possess positional knowledge about the pixels on semantically meaningful
contours, they could lead to ambiguous predictions on object boundaries. In
addition, although dilating the filter can expand its receptive field, the
total number of sampled pixels remains unchanged, which usually comprises a
small fraction of the receptive field's total area. Inspired by the Lateral
Inhibition (LI) mechanisms in human visual systems, we propose the dilated
convolution with lateral inhibitions (LI-Convs) to overcome these limitations.
Introducing LI mechanisms improves the convolutional filter's sensitivity to
semantic object boundaries. Moreover, since LI-Convs also implicitly take the
pixels from the laterally inhibited zones into consideration, they can also
extract features at a denser scale. By integrating LI-Convs into the Deeplabv3+

increasing the interest in heat transfer in rarefied gases. At these low
pressures, the heat transfer problems involving small geometries whose
characteristic length is of the order of the mean free path of the gas
molecules, raises new difficulties. This being especially severe in the case of
free convection, where the velocity of the gas is closely linked to the heat
transfer problem. Experiments with horizontal wires with diameters of $12.7\
\mu\mathrm{m}$ and $25\ \mu\mathrm{m}$ were conducted in a tailored vacuum
chamber with pressures from $0.03$ milibar to ambient pressure, reaching
temperature differences of up to $80$ K between the wire and the air.
Experimental data is comprised of Rayleigh numbers from $10^{-13}$ to $10^{-5}$
that cover a wide range from free molecular flow to continuum regime.
Particularly for the transition regime, with Knudsen numbers ranging between
0.1 and 10, the experimental data shows that the free convection heat transfer
cannot be represented solely as a function of the Rayleigh number, but a
dependence on Knudsen number must be introduced into the correlation as well.
The presented results for the Nusselt number below Rayleigh numbers of
$10^{-8}$ exhibit a clear departure from the available correlations in the
literature. A new empirical correlation for free convection from horizontal
thin wires from the transition to continuum regime is presented. The present
work sheds light on current thermal engineering problems which involves very
thin wires in their systems which interact with a surrounding environment with
a significant level of rarefaction.

equation with weighted Laplace operator. Further, the weighting for the Laplace
operator is given by the Lagrange multiplier for the Lipschitz constraint,
which modulates the sensitivity of the minimizer to perturbations. We then
design a provably robust training scheme using graph-based discretization of
the input space and a primal-dual algorithm to converge to the Lagrangian's
saddle point. Our analysis establishes a novel connection between elliptic
operators with constraint-enforced weighting and adversarial learning. We also
study the complementary problem of improving the robustness of minimizers with
a margin on their loss, formulated as a loss-constrained minimization problem
of the Lipschitz constant. We propose a technique to obtain robustified
minimizers, and evaluate fundamental Lipschitz lower bounds by approaching
Lipschitz constant minimization via a sequence of gradient $p$-norm
minimization problems. Ultimately, our results show that, for a desired nominal
performance, there exists a fundamental lower bound on the sensitivity to
adversarial perturbations that depends only on the loss function and the data
distribution, and that improvements in robustness beyond this bound can only be
made at the expense of nominal performance. Our training schemes provably
achieve these bounds both under constraints on performance and~robustness.

in solving serial decision-making and control problems in recent years. For
conventional RL formulations, Markov Decision Process (MDP) and
state-action-value function are the basis for the problem modeling and policy
evaluation. However, several challenging issues still remain. Among most cited
issues, the enormity of state/action space is an important factor that causes
inefficiency in accurately approximating the state-action-value function. We
observe that although actions directly define the agents' behaviors, for many
problems the next state after a state transition matters more than the action
taken, in determining the return of such a state transition. In this regard, we
propose a new learning paradigm, State Action Separable Reinforcement Learning
(sasRL), wherein the action space is decoupled from the value function learning
process for higher efficiency. Then, a light-weight transition model is learned
to assist the agent to determine the action that triggers the associated state
transition. In addition, our convergence analysis reveals that under certain
conditions, the convergence time of sasRL is $O(T^{1/k})$, where $T$ is the
convergence time for updating the value function in the MDP-based formulation
and $k$ is a weighting factor. Experiments on several gaming scenarios show
that sasRL outperforms state-of-the-art MDP-based RL algorithms by up to
$75\%$.

effectively manage the trade-offs between accuracy and aggregate diversity. In
this work, we propose a two-sided post-processing approach in which both user

team focused on the Social Distancing Index (SDI) which was calculated based on
five basic mobility measures. The SDI patterns showed a plateau stage in the
beginning of April that lasted for about two weeks. This phenomenon then
followed by a universal decline of SDI, increased number of trips and reduction
in percentage of people staying at home. We called the observation Quarantine
Fatigue. The Rate of Change (ROC) method was employed to trace back the start
date of quarantine fatigue which was indicated to be April 15th. Our analysis
showed that despite the existence of state-to-state variations, most states
started experiencing a quarantine fatigue phenomenon during the same period.
This observation became more important by knowing that none of the states had
officially announced the reopening until late April showing that people decided
to loosen up their social distancing practices before the official reopening
announcement. Moreover, our analysis indicated that official reopening led to a
rapid decline in SDI, raising the concern of a second wave of outbreak. The
synchronized trend among states also emphasizes the importance of a more
nationwide decision-making attitude for the future as the condition of each

current rates of world primary energy consumption $\mathcal E$, such that
$\lambda = \mathcal{E}/W = 5.9\pm0.1$ Gigawatts per trillion 2010 US dollars.
This empirical result implies that population expansion is a symptom rather
than a cause of the current exponential rise in $\mathcal E$ and carbon dioxide
emissions $C$, and that it is past innovation of economic production efficiency
$Y/\mathcal{E}$ that has been the primary driver of growth, at predicted rates
that agree well with data. Options for stabilizing $C$ are then limited to
rapid decarbonization of $\mathcal E$ through sustained implementation of over
one Gigawatt of renewable or nuclear power capacity per day. Alternatively,
assuming continued reliance on fossil fuels, civilization could shift to a
steady-state economy that devotes economic production exclusively to
maintenance rather than expansion. If this were instituted immediately,
continual energy consumption would still be required, so atmospheric carbon
dioxide concentrations would not balance natural sinks until concentrations
exceeded 500 ppmv, and double pre-industrial levels if the steady-state was
attained by 2030.

distributions whose mean is identical to that of the reference distribution and

data-driven approaches for prognostics that leverage the power of machine
learning models are gaining popularity. One of the most important categories of
data-driven approaches relies on a predefined or learned health indicator to
characterize the equipment condition up to the present time and make inference
on how it is likely to evolve in the future. In these approaches, health
indicator forecasting that constructs the health indicator curve over the
lifespan using partially observed measurements (i.e., health indicator values
within an initial period) plays a key role. Existing health indicator
forecasting algorithms, such as the functional Empirical Bayesian approach, the
regression-based formulation, a naive scenario matching based on the nearest
neighbor, have certain limitations. In this paper, we propose a new `generative
+ scenario matching' algorithm for health indicator forecasting. The key idea
behind the proposed approach is to first non-parametrically fit the underlying
health indicator curve with a continuous Gaussian Process using a sample of
run-to-failure health indicator curves. The proposed approach then generates a
rich set of random curves from the learned distribution, attempting to obtain
all possible variations of the target health condition evolution process over
the system's lifespan. The health indicator extrapolation for a piece of
functioning equipment is inferred as the generated curve that has the highest
matching level within the observed period. Our experimental results show the
superiority of our algorithm over the other state-of-the-art methods.

various data types like images and other analog or digital sensor data, all of

into downstream probabilistic encoding and decoding models. Surprisingly, these
issues have to date received significantly less attention. In this work we
examine the statistical properties of the deconvolved activity estimates, and
compare probabilistic models for these random signals. In particular, we
propose a zero-inflated gamma (ZIG) model, which characterizes the calcium
responses as a mixture of a gamma distribution and a point mass that serves to
model zero responses. We apply the resulting models to neural encoding and
decoding problems. We find that the ZIG model outperforms simpler models (e.g.,
Poisson or Bernoulli models) in the context of both simulated and real neural
data, and can therefore play a useful role in bridging calcium imaging analysis
methods with tools for analyzing activity in large neural populations.

is missing, a systematic analysis of the relationship between human mobility
and virus spread has never been conducted. A notable exceptions are France and
Italy, for which data on excess deaths, an indirect indicator which is
generally considered to be less affected by national and regional assumptions,
are available at department and municipality level, respectively. Using this
information together with anonymised and aggregated mobile data, this study
shows that mobility alone can explain up to 92% of the initial spread in these
two EU countries, while it has a slow decay effect after lockdown measures,
meaning that mobility restrictions seem to have effectively contribute to save
lives. It also emerges that internal mobility is more important than mobility
across provinces and that the typical lagged positive effect of reduced human
mobility on reducing excess deaths is around 14-20 days. An analogous analysis
relative to Spain, for which an IgG SARS-Cov-2 antibody screening study at
province level is used instead of excess deaths statistics, confirms the
findings. The same approach adopted in this study can be easily extended to
other European countries, as soon as reliable data on the spreading of the
virus at a suitable level of granularity will be available. Looking at past
data, relative to the initial phase of the outbreak in EU Member States, this
study shows in which extent the spreading of the virus and human mobility are
connected.

organisms: to a coarse approximation, an input $x \in \R^d$ is mapped to much
higher dimension $m \gg d$ by a random linear transformation, and is then
sparsified by a winner-take-all process in which only the positions of the top
$k$ values are retained, yielding a $k$-sparse vector $z \in \{0,1\}^m$. We
study the benefits of this representation for subsequent learning.
  We first show a universal approximation property, that arbitrary continuous
functions of $x$ are well approximated by linear functions of $z$, provided $m$
is large enough. This can be interpreted as saying that $z$ unpacks the
information in $x$ and makes it more readily accessible. The linear functions
can be specified explicitly and are easy to learn, and we give bounds on how
large $m$ needs to be as a function of the input dimension $d$ and the
smoothness of the target function. Next, we consider whether the representation
is adaptive to manifold structure in the input space. This is highly dependent
on the specific method of sparsification: we show that adaptivity is not
obtained under the winner-take-all mechanism, but does hold under a slight
variant. Finally we consider mappings to the representation space that are
random but are attuned to the data distribution, and we give favorable
approximation bounds in this setting.

report generation specifically requires the model to describe a medical image
with a fine-grained and semantic-coherence paragraph that should satisfy both
medical commonsense and logic. Previous works generally extract the global
image features and attempt to generate a paragraph that is similar to
referenced reports; however, this approach has two limitations. Firstly, the
regions of primary interest to radiologists are usually located in a small area
of the global image, meaning that the remainder parts of the image could be
considered as irrelevant noise in the training procedure. Secondly, there are
many similar sentences used in each medical report to describe the normal
regions of the image, which causes serious data bias. This deviation is likely
to teach models to generate these inessential sentences on a regular basis. To
address these problems, we propose an Auxiliary Signal-Guided Knowledge

ASGK integrates internal visual feature fusion and external medical linguistic

structure of ASGK consists of a medical graph encoder and a natural language

  We demonstrate these two phenomena via two fundamental graph problems,
namely, Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) and Minimum Dominating Set (MDS). Among our
many contributions, the highlights are the following.
  - In the CONGEST model, we show an $O(n/\epsilon)$-round
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for MVC on $G^2$, while no
$o(n^2)$-round algorithm is known for any better-than-2 approximation for MVC

incompleteness, causality and resolution disparity. Surface slopes are
estimated using only sparse samples from cross-sections within a geological
domain with no other information at intermediate depths. From boundary
detection to subsurface reconstruction, processes are automated in between. The
key problems to be solved are boundary extraction, region correspondence and
propagation of the boundaries via contour morphing. Established techniques from
computational physics, computer vision and signal processing are used with
appropriate modifications to address challenges in each area. To facilitate
boundary extraction, an edge map synthesis procedure is presented. This works
with connected component analysis, anisotropic diffusion and active contours to
convert unordered points into regularized boundaries. For region
correspondence, component relationships are handled via graphical
decomposition. FFT-based spatial alignment strategies are used in region
merging and splitting scenarios. Shape changes between aligned regions are
described by contour metamorphosis. Specifically, local spatial deformation is
modeled by PDE and computed using level-set methods. Directional predictions
are obtained using particle trajectories by following the evolving boundary.
However, when a branching point is encountered, particles may lose track of the
wavefront. To overcome this, a curvelet backtracking algorithm has been
proposed to recover information for boundary segments without particle coverage
to minimize shape distortion.

the potential for reduction in healthy tissue damage while preserving tumor
control. FLASH therapy relies on very high dose rate of > 40Gy/sec with
sub-second temporal beam modulation, taking a seemingly opposite direction from

challenges to dosimetry, beam control, and verification, as well as complexity

Submitted to OSA Continuum Journal",,,,"quant-ph physics.optics","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Metamaterials are artificially engineered periodic structures with
exceptional optical properties that are not found in conventional materials.
However, this definition of metamaterials can be extended if we introduce a
quantum degree of freedom by adding some quantum elements (e.g quantum dots,
cold atoms, Josephson junctions, molecules). Quantum metamaterials can then be
defined as artificially engineered nanostructures made up of quantum elements.
Furthermore, they exhibit controllable quantum states, maintain quantum
coherence for times much higher than the transversal time of the
electromagnetic signal. Metamaterials have been used to realised invisibility
cloaking, super-resolution, energy harvesting, and sensing. Most of these
applications are performed in the classical regime. Of recent, metamaterials
have gradually found their way into the quantum regime, particularly to quantum
sensing and quantum information processing. The use of quantum metamaterials
for quantum information processing is still new and rapidly growing. In quantum
information processing, quantum metamaterials have enabled the control and
manipulation of quantum states, single photon generation, creating quantum
entanglement, quantum states switching, quantum search algorithm, quantum state
engineering tasks, and many more. In this work, we briefly review the theory,
fabrication and applications of quantum metamaterials to quantum information

major challenge to achieve a full gain of diversity over multi-input

system called FBMC offset upper-lower polyphase network (FBMC/OULP) in which,
to eliminate the intrinsic interference, the complex-valued symbols are
alternatively transmitted via upper and lower half of polyphase network
branches with an offset time. The symbol density of the FBMC/OULP system is
equal to one complex-valued symbol in time-frequency lattice. Also, for
transmission over frequency selective channels, a minimum mean square error
(MMSE) estimator is employed at the receiver of the FBMC/OULP system to
eliminate the interference caused by the frequency selectivity of the channel.
The proposed scheme mitigates the produced interference between symbols in the
upper and lower polyphase branches, based on the circular convolutional
property. As a result of using complex-valued symbols and diminishing the
interference, the full diversity gain of the orthogonal space-time block codes
(OSTBC) can be achieved in MIMO channels by a low complex maximum likelihood
(ML) detector. In comparison with the orthogonal frequency division
multiplexing (OFDM) system, simulation results indicate that the proposed

the communication between localized spatially segregated dynamically active

to secrete a chemical into the extracellular medium (bulk region) and it can
also sense the concentration of this chemical in the region around its
boundary. This feedback from the bulk region, resulting from the entire
collection of cells, in turn modifies the intracellular dynamics within each
cell. In the limit where the signaling compartments are circular disks with a
small common radius $\epsilon \ll 1$ and where the bulk diffusivity is
asymptotically large, a matched asymptotic analysis is used to reduce the
dimensionless PDE-ODE system into a nonlinear ODE system with global coupling.
For Sel'kov reaction kinetics, this ODE system for the intracellular dynamics
and the spatial average of the bulk diffusion field is then used to investigate
oscillatory instabilities in the dynamics of the cells that are triggered due
to the global coupling. In particular, numerical bifurcation software on the
ODEs is used to study the overall effect of coupling defective cells (cells
that behave differently from the remaining cells) to a group of identical
cells. Moreover, when the number of cells is large, the Kuramoto order
parameter is computed to predict the degree of phase synchronization of the
intracellular dynamics. Quorum sensing behavior, characterized by the onset of
collective behavior in the intracellular dynamics as the number of cells
increases above a threshold, is also studied. Our analysis shows that the cell
population density plays a dual role of triggering and then quenching
synchronous oscillations in the intracellular dynamics.

sensing beyond reduced-order models through 1) the automated creation of a
precise tactile dataset for the BioTac over diverse physical interactions, 2) a
3D finite element (FE) model of the BioTac, which complements the experimental
dataset with high-resolution, distributed contact data, and 3)
neural-network-based mappings from raw BioTac signals to low-dimensional

Chromatic Learning (CL), obtains a low-dimensional dense feature representation

consumes memory linear in the size of the co-occurrence graph. By leveraging
the structural properties of the co-occurrence graph, CL can compress sparse
datasets, such as KDD Cup 2012, that contain over 50M features down to 1024,
using an order of magnitude fewer features than frequency-based truncation and

how $s$-sparse halfspaces can be efficiently learned under the challenging
malicious noise model, where an adversary may corrupt both the unlabeled

designing a computationally efficient active learning algorithm with
near-optimal label complexity of $\tilde{O}\big({s \log^4 \frac d \epsilon}

Following previous work we describe an unambiguous and measurable signature of
deconfined quark matter in the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of neutron star
binary mergers including equal-mass and unequal-mass systems of different total
binary mass. The softening of the EoS by the PT at higher densities, i.e. after
merging, leads to a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger GW
frequency f_peak relative to the tidal deformability Lambda inferred during the
premerger inspiral phase. Hence, measuring such an increase of the postmerger
frequency provides evidence for the presence of a strong PT. If the postmerger
frequency and the tidal deformability are compatible with results from purely
baryonic EoS models yielding very tight relations between f_peak and Lambda, a
strong PT can be excluded up to a certain density. We find tight correlations
of f_peak and Lambda with the maximum density during the early postmerger
remnant evolution. These GW observables thus inform about the density regime
which is probed by the remnant and its GW emission. Exploiting such relations
we devise a directly applicable, concrete procedure to constrain the onset
density of the QCD PT from future GW measurements. We point out two interesting
scenarios: if no indications for a PT are inferred from a GW detection, our
procedure yields a lower limit on the onset density of the hadron quark PT. On
the contrary, if a merger event reveals evidence for the occurrence of
deconfined quark matter, the inferred GW parameters set an upper limit on the
PT onset density. (abridged)

learning a disease classification model with extra Chest X-ray (CXR) data is
yet challenging. Recent researches have demonstrated that performance
bottleneck exists in joint training on different CXR datasets, and few made

challenges. Specifically, the imperfect data is in two folds: domain
discrepancy, as the image appearances vary across datasets; and label
discrepancy, as different datasets are partially labeled. To this end, we
formulate the multi-label thoracic disease classification problem as weighted
independent binary tasks according to the categories. For common categories
shared across domains, we adopt task-specific adversarial training to alleviate
the feature differences. For categories existing in a single dataset, we
present uncertainty-aware temporal ensembling of model predictions to mine the
information from the missing labels further. In this way, our framework
simultaneously models and tackles the domain and label discrepancies, enabling
superior knowledge mining ability. We conduct extensive experiments on three

spectral evolution. One of the methods used to understand the physical origin
of these behaviours is to study correlation between the spectral fit
parameters. In this work, we used a Bayesian analysis method to fit
time-resolved spectra of GRB pulses that were detected by the

pulsed long bursts ($T_{90}\geq2$ s). Among all the parameter correlations, we
found that the correlation between the low-energy power-law index $\alpha$ and
the energy flux exhibited a systematic behaviour. We presented the properties
of the observed characteristics of this behaviour and interpreted it in the

intelligent vehicle control technologies have enabled vehicles to detect
traffic anomalies on the road and then notify surrounding vehicles to improve
traffic safety. However, due to the high-speed movement of vehicles and the
frequent topological changes between vehicles, it is difficult for vehicles to
evaluate the credibility of received messages. Quite a lot of research effort
has been carried out to establish various trustworthiness platforms. These
studies mostly focus on how to enhance the accuracy of credibility evaluation,
overlooking that the transmission performance may affect the quality of vehicle
messages. In this paper, we aim to support the improvement of credibility
evaluation in vehicle networks by enhancing the transmission experience of
vehicles. The proposed solution utilizes the vehicle's trajectory information,
detection range and a roadside unit (RSU) coverage to form a controlled number
of detection zones, which guarantees that events can be detected and reported
while limiting the number of transmission vehicles. Furthermore, our scheme
takes account of vehicle credibility and interference ranges when selecting
reporting vehicles, supporting the timely and reliable delivery of vehicles'
event reports when accidents occur. Our ns2 evaluation shows that our scheme
can greatly reduce delay and loss rates of vehicle messages to help existing
studies on accurate vehicle credibility evaluation.

radiative transfer equations related to the vertical structure of accretion
discs with finite optical depth. In the non-gray atmosphere, we employ the
optical-depth dependent Eddington factor to define the relationship between the
mean intensity and radiation stress tensor. Analytical solutions are achieved
for two cases: (i) radiative equilibrium, and (ii) a disc with uniform internal
heating and both cases are assumed to be in local thermodynamical equilibrium
(LTE), too. These solutions enable us to study the probable role of scattering
and disc optical depth on the emergent intensity and other radiative
quantities. Our results show that for the first case, the surface value of mean
intensity with constant Eddington factor is three times larger than that with a
variable factor. Moreover, scattering has no role in the vertical radiative
structure of discs with the assumptions of the first case. On the other hand,
for the second case, we encounter reductions in all radiative quantities as the
photon destruction probability decreases (which is equivalent to increasing
scattering). Furthermore, for both cases with total optical depth less than
unity, the outward intensity towards the polar direction becomes less than that
from the edges of disc which is contrary to limb-darkening. In the end, we
apply our results to find the spectrum from accretion systems, based on two
dynamical models. Consequently, we can see how the total optical depth varies
with frequency and causes remarkable changes in the emergent spectra.

to analytically learn from heterogeneous, sparse, or forming networks. In the
case of a heterogeneous network, modeling all network states using a
binary-valued matrix can be difficult. On the other hand, sparse or currently
forming networks have many missing edges, which are represented as zeros, thus
introducing class imbalance or noise. We propose a time-parameterized matrix
(TP-matrix) and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness in non-bipartite,

a measure of a node's boosting or diminishing predictive influence using
backward and forward-looking maximization over the temporal space of the

prediction applications, including intelligent business process management
systems and context-aware workflow engines. We evaluated our model on four

practice to apply this approximation to the counting statistics; also at low

skewed results not only for low-count features, such as background level
estimation, but also for its estimation at double-digit count numbers. In
effect, this approximation is shown to be imprecise on all levels of count.
Instead, a Multinomial approach is introduced as well as a more standard
Poisson method, which we compare with the Gaussian case. These two methods
originate from a proper analysis of a multi-detector setup and a standard
triple axis instrument.We devise a simple mathematical procedure to produce
unbiased fits using the Multinomial distribution and demonstrate this method on
synthetic and actual inelastic scattering data. We find that the Multinomial
method provide almost unbiased results, and in some cases outperforms the
Poisson statistics. Although significantly biased, the Gaussian approach is in
general more robust in cases where the fitted model is not a true

aggregation strategy where each node updates its representation by combining

number of layers increases, information gets smoothed and squashed and node
embeddings become indistinguishable, negatively affecting performance.
Therefore, practical GNN models employ few layers and only leverage the graph
structure in terms of limited, small neighbourhoods around each node.
Inevitably, practical GNNs do not capture information depending on the global
structure of the graph. While there have been several works studying the
limitations and expressivity of GNNs, the question of whether practical
applications on graph structured data require global structural knowledge or
not, remains unanswered. In this work, we empirically address this question by
giving access to global information to several GNN models, and observing the

Pauli particle enable a family of structure-preserving geometric algorithms for
guiding center dynamics with long-term stability and accuracy. This discovery
overcomes the difficulty associated with the unstable parasitic modes for
variational symplectic integrators when applied to the degenerate guiding
center Lagrangian. It is a pleasant surprise that Pauli's Hamiltonian for
electrons, which predated the Dirac equation and marks the beginning of
particle physics, reappears in classical physics as an effective algorithm for
solving an important plasma physics problem. This technique is applicable to
other degenerate Lagrangians reduced from regular Lagrangians.

automatically obtain high level representations and that use recurrent neural

considerably more powerful than previous approaches, with an average increment,
of more than $7\%$ on the F1 score over the previous best performing model.
Furthermore, we consider the problem of personalizing HAR deep learning models,
which is of great importance in several applications. We propose a simple and
effective transfer-learning based strategy to adapt a model to a specific user,
providing an average increment of $6\%$ on the F1 score on the predictions for
that user. Our extensive experimental evaluation proves the significantly
superior capabilities of our proposed framework over the current

assignment phase have been shown mathematically to approach the gradients
provided by Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) when the network is
infinitesimally nudged toward its target. In practice, however, training a
network with the gradient estimates provided by EP does not scale to visual
tasks harder than MNIST. In this work, we show that a bias in the gradient
estimate of EP, inherent in the use of finite nudging, is responsible for this
phenomenon and that cancelling it allows training deep ConvNets by EP. We show
that this bias can be greatly reduced by using symmetric nudging (a positive
nudging and a negative one). We also generalize previous EP equations to the
case of cross-entropy loss (by opposition to squared error). As a result of
these advances, we are able to achieve a test error of 11.7% on CIFAR-10 by EP,
which approaches the one achieved by BPTT and provides a major improvement with
respect to the standard EP approach with same-sign nudging that gives 86% test
error. We also apply these techniques to train an architecture with asymmetric
forward and backward connections, yielding a 13.2% test error. These results
highlight EP as a compelling biologically-plausible approach to compute error
gradients in deep neural networks.

Stabilizing the trunk becomes even more challenging if the terrain is uneven

However, so far it has only been studied for level running. In this work, we
investigate whether the VP control method can accommodate single step-downs and

the VP method is able to stabilize single step-down perturbations up to 40 cm,

compiled from Extremely Metal-Poor Representatives Explored by the Subaru

8m-class telescopes including Keck and Subaru (Kojima et al. 2019, Izotov et

models. We find that neon- and argon-to-oxygen ratios are comparable to those
of known local dwarf galaxies, and that the nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios
(N/O) are lower than 20% (N/O)_sun consistent with the low oxygen abundance.
However, the iron-to-oxygen abundance ratios (Fe/O) of the EMPGs are generally
high; the EMPGs with the 2%-solar oxygen abundance show high Fe/O ratios of
~90-140% (Fe/O)_sun, which are unlikely explained by suggested scenarios of
Type Ia supernova iron productions, iron's dust depletion, and metal-poor gas
inflow onto previously metal-riched galaxies with solar abundances. Moreover,
these EMPGs have very high HeII4686/H$\beta$ ratios of ~1/40, which are not
reproduced by existing models of high-mass X-ray binaries whose progenitor
stellar masses are less than 120 M_sun. Comparing stellar-nucleosynthesis and
photoionization models with a comprehensive sample of EMPGs identified by this

Even though our method does not exploit any knowledge of attacks during

compatibility is then considered in selecting suitable substituted cations. We
demonstrate this strategy by using A(5B0.2)O3 perovskite as a model system. We
show that the system can be partitioned into 12 subsystems. Ten of the
subsystems have formed a single-phase cubic perovskite, while two have

Goldschmidt's tolerance factor, while the formation of the ordering structure

vortices (UFVs) carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) in free space. Our
analysis reveals much more complex temporal dynamics than that of few-cycle
fundamental Gaussian-like beams, particularly when approaching the single-cycle
regime and the magnitude of the topological charge $l$ is high. The recently
described lower bound $\sqrt{|l|}$ to the number of oscillations of UFVs with
propagation-invariant temporal shape (isodiffracting UFVs) is found to hold on
average also for UFVs of general type, with variations along the propagation
direction above and below that bound, even vanishing locally. These variations
are determined by the so-called Porras factor or $g_0$-factor characterizing
the dependence of the Rayleigh distance of the spectral constituents with
frequency. With a given available bandwidth, UFVs must widen temporally with
increasing magnitude of the topological charge, and must widen or may shrink
temporally during propagation as a result of the axially varying,
$g_0$-dependent lower bound. Under very restrictive conditions in their
generation, an UFV can be shrunk below the lower bound $\sqrt{|l|}$ at a focus
into a kind of locally compressed state of OAM, but it broadens well-above
$\sqrt{|l|}$ and distorts in a tiny fraction of the depth of focus because of
the dispersions introduced by Gouy's phase and wave front mismatch. These
propagation phenomena have implications and should be taken into account in
experiments and applications of UFVs, such as the generation of high-harmonics
and attosecond pulses with high OAM, or in OAM-based ultrafast communications
systems, as well as in other areas of physics such as acoustics or electron

quantum system but independent of the evolution details, and therefore quantum
computation based on nonadiabatic geometric phases is robust against control
errors. To realize nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation, it is necessary
to ensure that the quantum system undergoes a cyclic evolution and the
dynamical phases are removed from the total phases. To satisfy these
conditions, the evolution paths in previous schemes are usually restricted to
some special forms, e.g, orange-slice-shaped loops, which make the paths
unnecessarily long in general. In this paper, we put forward an approach to the
realization of nonadiabatic geometric quantum computation by which a universal
set of nonadiabatic geometric gates can be realized with any desired evolution
paths. Our approach makes it possible to realize geometric quantum computation
with an economical evolution time so the influence of environment noises on the
quantum gates can be minimized further.

time-periodic (LTP) systems with periodic inputs. This method overcomes the
issues related to the computation of frequency response of LTP systems by
utilizing the frequency response of the time-lifted system with linear
time-invariant structure instead. The response is estimated with an ensemble of
input-output data with periodic inputs. This allows the frequency-domain
subspace identification technique to be extended to LTP systems. The
time-aliased periodic impulse response can then be estimated and the
order-revealing decomposition of the block-Hankel matrix is formulated. The
consistency of the proposed method is proved under mild noise assumptions.
Numerical simulation shows that the proposed method performs better than
multiple widely-used time-domain subspace identification methods when an

Images are known to have sparser representation in Wavelets and other similar
transforms. Compressed Sensing is a technique which proposes simultaneous
acquisition and compression of any signal by taking very few random linear
measurements (M). The quality of reconstruction directly relates with M, which
should be above a certain threshold for a reliable recovery. Since these
measurements can non-adaptively reconstruct the signal to a faithful extent
using purely analytical methods like Basis Pursuit, Matching Pursuit, Iterative
thresholding, etc., we can be assured that these compressed samples contain
enough information about any relevant macro-level feature contained in the
(image) signal. Thus if we choose to deliberately acquire an even lower number
of measurements - in order to thwart the possibility of a comprehensible
reconstruction, but high enough to infer whether a relevant feature exists in
an image - we can achieve accurate image classification while preserving its
privacy. Through the print error detection problem, it is demonstrated that
such a novel system can be implemented in practise.

adhesion phenomena between rough solids when the bodies are separated by

longer (Casimir forces) separations. The reason for this is the pull-in
instability of the systems with the elastic suspension that poses a formidable
limitation. In this paper we propose a genuine experimental configuration that
does not suffer from the short distance instability. The method is based on
adhered cantilever, whose shape is sensitive to the forces acting near the
adhered end. The general principle of the method, its possible realization and
feasibility are extensively discussed. The dimensions of the cantilever are
determined by the maximum sensitivity to the forces. If the adhesion is defined
by strong capillary or chemical interactions, the method loses its sensitivity.
Special discussion is presented for the determination of the minimum distance
between the rough solids upon contact, and for the compensation of the residual
electrostatic contribution. The proposed method can be applied to any kind of

  This work presents Bankrupt, a high-rate highly clandestine channel that
enables covert communication between the spy and the receiver running on

allocates a separate memory region on the same intermediary, also accessed via

the spy causes deep queuing at one memory bank, which is the finest addressable

by modelling the wall shear stress in these layers using the Prandtl's mixing
length model, as did the authors of Albousssi\`ere \& Lingwood (Phys. Fluids,
2000). The idea for this new model arose from the failure of previous shallow
water models that assumed a laminar Hartmann layer to recover the correct
amount of dissipation found in some regimes of the MATUR experiment. This
experiment, conducted by the authors of Messadek \& Moreau (J. Fluid Mech.
2002), consisted of a thin layer of mercury electrically driven in differential
rotation in a transverse magnetic field. Numerical Simulations of our new model
in the configuration of this experiment allowed us to recover experimental
values of both the global angular momentum and the local velocity up to a few
percent when the Hartmann layer was in a sufficiently well developed turbulent
state. We thus provide an evidence that the unexplained level of dissipation
observed in MATUR in these specific regimes was caused by turbulence in the
Hartmann layers. A parametric analysis of the flow, made possible by the
simplicity of our model, also revealed that turbulent friction in the Hartmann
layer prevented quasi-2D turbulence from becoming more intense and limited the
size of the large scales.

unsatisfying prediction performance. We propose a novel algorithm (EPARS) that
could early predict STAR in a semester by modeling online and offline learning
behaviors. The online behaviors come from the log of activities when students
use the online learning management system. The offline behaviors derive from
the check-in records of the library. Our main observations are two folds.
Significantly different from good students, STAR barely have regular and clear
study routines. We devised a multi-scale bag-of-regularity method to extract
the regularity of learning behaviors that is robust to sparse data. Second,
friends of STAR are more likely to be at risk. We constructed a co-occurrence
network to approximate the underlying social network and encode the social
homophily as features through network embedding. To validate the proposed
algorithm, extensive experiments have been conducted among an Asian university
with 15,503 undergraduate students. The results indicate EPARS outperforms
baselines by 14.62% ~ 38.22% in predicting STAR.

the sharp boundary of the building could be preserved. Experiments are

naturally leads to a sample complexity bound. We also characterize
identifiability of more general RUMs with features and propose a generalized

options. However, this in turn requires that the mapping system contains
updated information on CCTV cameras' exact geo-location, coverage area, and
possibly other meta-data (e.g., resolution, facial recognition features,
operator). Such information is however missing from current mapping systems,
and there are several ways to fix this. One solution is to perform CCTV camera
detection on geo-location tagged images, e.g., street view imagery on various
platforms, user images publicly posted in image sharing platforms such as
Flickr. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there are no computer

examine how the inclusion of the transverse direction, orthogonal to the
junction of the double-well, can intervene in the tunneling dynamics of bosonic
clouds. We use a well-known many-body numerical method, called the
multiconfigurational time-dependent Hartree for bosons (MCTDHB) method. MCTDHB
allows one to obtain accurately the time-dependent many-particle wavefunction
of the bosons which in principle entails all the information of interest about
the system under investigation. We analyze the tunneling dynamics by preparing
the initial state of the bosonic clouds in the left well of the double-well

state. We unravel the detailed mechanism of the tunneling process by analyzing
the evolution in time of the survival probability, depletion and fragmentation,
and the many-particle position, momentum, and angular-momentum expectation
values and their variances. As a general rule, all objects lose coherence while
tunneling through the barrier and the states which include transverse

change orbits and move with little to no fuel, but they are computed using
motion models of a higher fidelity than the commonly used two-body problem
(2BP). For this purpose, perturbation methods that explore the third-body
effect are especially attractive, since they can accurately convey the system
dynamics of a three-body configuration with a lower computational cost, by
employing mapping techniques or exploring analytical approximations.
  The focus of this work is to broaden the knowledge of low-energy trajectories
by developing new mathematical tools to assist in mission design applications.
In particular, novel motion models based on the third-body effect are
conceived. One application of this study focuses on the trajectory design for
missions to near-Earth asteroids. Two different projects are explored: one is
based on the preliminary design of separate rendezvous and capture missions to
the invariant manifolds of libration point $L_2$. This is achieved by studying
two recently discovered asteroids and determining dates, fuel cost and final
control history for each trajectory. The other covers a larger study on
asteroid capture missions, where several bodies are regarded as potential
targets. The candidates are considered using a multi-fidelity design framework
that filters through the trajectory options using models of motion of
increasing accuracy, so that a final refined, low-thrust solution is obtained.
The trajectory design hinges on harnessing Earth's gravity by exploiting
encounters outside its sphere of influence, the named Earth-resonant
encounters.

Python suffer from numerous problems that drastically limit their usefulness.
They impose order-of-magnitude overheads, report information at too coarse a
granularity, or fail in the face of threads. Worse, past
profilers---essentially variants of their counterparts for C---are oblivious to
the fact that optimizing code in scripting languages requires information about
code spanning the divide between the scripting language and libraries written
in compiled languages.
  This paper introduces scripting-language aware profiling, and presents
Scalene, an implementation of scripting-language aware profiling for Python.
Scalene employs a combination of sampling, inference, and disassembly of
byte-codes to efficiently and precisely attribute execution time and memory
usage to either Python, which developers can optimize, or library code, which
they cannot. It includes a novel sampling memory allocator that reports
line-level memory consumption and trends with low overhead, helping developers
reduce footprints and identify leaks. Finally, it introduces a new metric, copy
volume, to help developers root out insidious copying costs across the
Python/library boundary, which can drastically degrade performance. Scalene
works for single or multi-threaded Python code, is precise, reporting detailed
information at the line granularity, while imposing modest overheads
(26%--53%).

maximum velocity and the intensity of the magnetic field. Given the
corresponding Reynolds and Hartmann numbers, we derive an upper bound for the
dimension of the attractor and find out which modes must be chosen to achieve
this bound. Thier, are compared to heuristics estimates for the size of the
smallest scales and anisotropy of the turbulence. We identify boundaries
separating different sets of modes in the space of non-dimensional parameters,
which are reminiscent of three important previously identified transitions
observed in the real flow. The first boundary separates classical hydrodynamic
sets of modes from MHD sets where anisotropy takes the form of a ``Joule
cone''. The second boundary separates 3D MHD sets from quasi-2D MHD sets. The
third separates sets where all the modes exhibit the same boundary layer
thickness or so, and sets where many different ``boundary layer modes''
co-exists in the set. The non-dimensional relations defining these boundaries
are then compared to the heuristics known for the transition between isotropic
and anisotropic MHD turbulence, 3D and quasi-2D MHD turbulence and that between
a turbulent and a laminar Hartmann layer. In addition to this 3D approach, we
also determine upper bounds for the dimension of forced turbulent flows
modelled using a 2D MHD equation, relevant in the quasi-2D MHD regime. The
advantage of this 2D approach is that, while upper bounds are quite loose in
three dimensions, optimal upper bounds exist for the 2D nonlinear term. This
allows us to derive realistic attractor dimensions for quasi-2D MHD flows.

an insufficient stress to induce local yielding of the material. Under acoustic
excitation, trapped bubbles can be driven into volumetric oscillations and
apply an additional local strain and stress that can trigger yielding and
assist their release. In this paper we explore different regimes of microbubble
oscillation and translation driven by an ultrasound field in a model
yield-stress fluid, a Carbopol microgel. We first analyse the linear bubble
oscillation dynamics to measure the local, high-frequency viscosity of the
material. We then use acoustic pressure gradients to induce bubble translation
and examine the elastic part of the response of the material below yielding. We
find that, at moderate pressure amplitude, the additional stresses applied by
volumetric oscillations and acoustic radiation forces do not lead to any
detectable irreversible bubble motion. At high pressure amplitude, we observe
non-spherical shape oscillations that result in erratic bubble motion. The
shape modes and critical pressures we observe differ from the predictions of a
recent model of shape oscillations in soft solids.Based on our findings, we
discuss possible reasons for the lack of bubble release in Carbopol and suggest
other systems in which ultrasound-assisted bubble rise may be observed.

is based on the calculation of ($\alpha$,$\gamma$) cross sections at

nucleosynthesis of so-called $p$-nuclei. The standard calculations in the
statistical model show a dramatic sensitivity to the chosen $\alpha$-nucleus
potential. The present study explains the reason for this dramatic sensitivity
which results from the tail of the imaginary $\alpha$-nucleus potential in the
underlying optical model calculation of the total reaction cross section. As an
alternative to the optical model, a simple barrier transmission model is
suggested. It is shown that this simple model in combination with a well-chosen
$\alpha$-nucleus potential is able to predict total $\alpha$-induced reaction
cross sections for a wide range of heavy target nuclei above $A \gtrsim 150$
with uncertainties below a factor of two. The new predictions from the simple
model do not require any adjustment of parameters to experimental reaction
cross sections whereas in previous statistical model calculations all
predictions remained very uncertain because the parameters of the
$\alpha$-nucleus potential had to be adjusted to experimental data. The new
model allows to predict the reaction rate of the astrophysically important
$^{176}$W($\alpha$,$\gamma$)$^{180}$Os reaction with reduced uncertainties,
leading to a significantly lower reaction rate at low temperatures. The new
approach could also be validated for a broad range of target nuclei from $A

other hand, supervised machine learning methods can generate complex non-Markov
sequences, but these sequences are vulnerable against perturbations. Further,
concatenation of newly learned sequence to the already learned one is difficult
due to catastrophe forgetting, although concatenation is essential for
cognitive functions such as inference. How stable complex sequences are
generated still remains unclear. We have developed a neural network with fast
and slow dynamics, which are inspired by the experiments. The slow dynamics
store history of inputs and outputs and affect the fast dynamics depending on
the stored history. We show the learning rule that requires only local
information can form the network generating the complex and robust sequences in
the fast dynamics. The slow dynamics work as bifurcation parameters for the
fast one, wherein they stabilize the next pattern of the sequence before the
current pattern is destabilized. This co-existence period leads to the stable
transition between the current and the next pattern in the sequence. We further
find that timescale balance is critical to this period. Our study provides a
novel mechanism generating the robust complex sequences with multiple

Hypergraphs respond to this need, providing a mathematical representation of a
system allowing from pairs to larger groups. In this work, through the use of
different hypergraphs, we study how group interactions influence the evolution
of cooperation in a structured population, by analyzing the evolutionary
dynamics of the public goods game. Here we show that, likewise network
reciprocity, group interactions also promote cooperation. More importantly, by
means of an invasion analysis in which the conditions for a strategy to survive
are studied, we show how, in heterogeneously-structured populations,
reciprocity among players is expected to grow with the increasing of the order
of the interactions. This is due to the heterogeneity of connections and,
particularly, to the presence of individuals standing out as hubs in the
population. Our analysis represents a first step towards the study of
evolutionary dynamics through higher-order interactions, and gives insights
into why cooperation in heterogeneous higher-order structures is enhanced.
Lastly, it also gives clues about the co-existence of cooperative and

model that we aim to explain is a black-box. We stress out that our novel
framework does not require access or knowledge of the internal structure or the
training data of the black-box model. We conduct experiments with two
generative models, VAEs and GANs, and synthesize exemplars for various data
formats, image, text and tabular, demonstrating that our framework is generic.
We also employ our prototype synthetization framework on various black-box
models, for which we only know the input and the output formats, showing that
it is model-agnostic. Moreover, we compare our framework (available at
https://github.com/antoniobarbalau/exemplar) with a model-dependent approach
based on gradient descent, proving that our framework obtains equally-good
exemplars in a shorter computational time.

These solvers require initial guesses to generate a sequence of improving

accelerate iterative solvers for physical systems with graph networks (GNs) by
predicting the initial guesses to reduce the number of iterations. Unlike
existing methods that aim to learn physical systems in an end-to-end manner,
our approach guarantees long-term stability and therefore leads to more
accurate solutions. Furthermore, our method improves the run time performance
of traditional iterative solvers. To explore our method we make use of
position-based dynamics (PBD) as a common solver for physical systems and
evaluate it by simulating the dynamics of elastic rods. Our approach is able to
generalize across different initial conditions, discretizations, and realistic
material properties. Finally, we demonstrate that our method also performs well
when taking discontinuous effects into account such as collisions between
individual rods. Finally, to illustrate the scalability of our approach, we
simulate complex 3D tree models composed of over a thousand individual branch
segments swaying in wind fields. A video showing dynamic results of our graph

We hypothesize and provide evidence through subjective analysis that the

channels, each predicting a score corresponding to one of the three visual
appeal factors. For group emotion estimation, we propose a convolutional neural

new architecture enforces the network to put emphasis on the important regions
in the images, and achieves comparable results to the state-of-the-art. Next,
we develop a network for the image ranking task that combines group emotion,
aesthetics and image quality scores. Owing to the unavailability of suitable

during various social events. We present experimental results on this database

that the proposed framework can reliably predict the overall appeal of images

thin relativistic pancake. It pushes out the magnetospheric field lines, and
they gradually reconnect behind the pancake, generating a variable wind far
stronger than the normal spindown wind of the magnetar. Repeating ejections
drive blast waves in the amplified wind. We suggest that these ejections
generate the simultaneous X-ray and radio bursts detected from SGR 1935+2154. A
modest energy budget of the magnetospheric perturbation $\sim 10^{40}$ erg is
sufficient to produce the observed bursts. Our simulation predicts a narrow (a

the radio burst emitted far outside the magnetosphere. This timing is caused by
the extreme relativistic motion of the ejecta.

millimeter-wave (mmWave) channels. Hence, performance improvement needs
knowledge and control of the spatial domain. In particular, antenna structure
and radiation parameters affect the beamforming performance in mmWave
communications systems. In order to address the impairments such as beam
misalignments, outage loss, tracking inability, blockage, etc., an optimum
value of the beamwidth must be determined. In our previous paper, assuming a
communication system that creates a beam per cluster, we theoretically
investigated the beamwidth-received power relation in the cluster level mmWave
channels. We used uniform linear array (ULA) antenna in our analysis. In this
paper, we revisit the analysis and update the expressions for the scenario
where we use rectangular uniform planar array (R-UPA) antenna. Rectangular beam
model is considered to approximate the main lobe pattern of the antenna. For
the channel, we derive beamwidth-dependent extracted power expressions for two
intra-cluster channel models, IEEE 802.11ad and our previous work based on
ray-tracing (RT-ICM). Combining antenna and channel gains, in case of the
perfect alignment, we confirm that the optimum beamwidth converges zero.
Performing asymptotic analysis of the received power, we give the formulation
and insights that the practical nonzero beamwidth values can be achieved
although sacrificing subtle from the maximum received power. Our analysis shows
that to reach 95% of the maximum power for a typical indoor mmWave cluster, a
practical beamwidth of 3.5 deg is enough. Finally, our analysis results show
that there is a 13 dB increase in the maximum theoretical received power when
UPA is used over ULA. We show that an 8 x 8 UPA can reach 50% of that maximum
received power while the received power is still 10 dB larger than the ULA
scenario.

The main findings include that TensorFlow-related topics were most prevalent in

StackOverflow tends to include lower-level troubleshooting, while Kaggle
focuses on practicality and optimising leaderboard performance. In addition,
across both communities, DS discussion is increasing at a dramatic rate. While
TensorFlow discussion on StackOverflow is slowing, interest in Keras is rising.
Finally, ensemble algorithms are the most mentioned ML/DL algorithms in Kaggle

that well-established numerical algorithms can be used for pre-stressed

Computational structure prediction methods generally leverage pre-defined

characteristics of accurate models directly from atomic coordinates of protein
complexes, with no prior assumptions. Here we introduce a machine learning
method that learns directly from the 3D positions of all atoms to identify

multiple ingredients that together enable end-to-end learning from molecular
structures containing tens of thousands of atoms: a point-based representation
of atoms, equivariance with respect to rotation and translation, local
convolutions, and hierarchical subsampling operations. When used in combination
with previously developed scoring functions, our network substantially improves
the identification of accurate structural models among a large set of possible
models. Our network can also be used to predict the accuracy of a given
structural model in absolute terms. The architecture we present is readily
applicable to other tasks involving learning on 3D structures of large atomic

systematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we
explore the feasibility of learning deep models for COVID-19 diagnosis from a
single radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological
images. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called
CoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given
condition, i.e., the annotations of the lung and COVID-19 infection. Our
CoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of visual finds of
COVID-19 infection, and further synthesize diverse and high-resolution
radiological images that match the input conditions precisely. Both deep
classification and segmentation networks trained on synthesized samples from
CoSinGAN achieve notable detection accuracy of COVID-19 infection. Such results
are significantly better than the counterparts trained on the same extremely
small number of real samples (1 or 2 real samples) by using strong data
augmentation, and approximate to the counterparts trained on large dataset
(2846 real images). It confirms our method can significantly reduce the
performance gap between deep models trained on extremely small dataset and on
large dataset, and thus has the potential to realize learning COVID-19
diagnosis from few radiological images in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.

k-period performance metrics - k-day Mean Absolute Percentage Error (kMAPE) and
k-day Median Symmetric Accuracy (kMdSA) - were developed for evaluating the

Errors in prediction using kMAPE and kMdSA for LSTM models were both as low as

slightly underestimated while ARIMA slightly overestimated the numbers in the

COVID-19 cases. While ARIMA requires longer sequences, LSTMs can perform
reasonably well with sequence sizes as small as 3. However, LSTMs require a
large number of training samples. Further, the development of k-period
performance metrics proposed is likely to be useful for performance evaluation
of time series models in predicting multiple periods. Based on the k-period

complete timing-sensitive tasks, such as balancing a glass of water or carrying
a bowl with a ball inside it. Understanding how the stroke-induced motor

for improved recovery. In this study, we investigate the effects of abnormal
joint coupling patterns induced by flexion synergy on timing-sensitive motor
coordination in the paretic upper limb. We design a virtual ball-in-bowl task
that requires fast movements for optimal performance and implement it on a
robotic system, capable of providing varying levels of abduction loading at the
shoulder. We recruit 12 participants (6 individuals with chronic stroke and 6
unimpaired controls) and assess their skill at the task at 3 levels of loading,
defined by the vertical force applied at the robot end-effector. Our results
show that, for individuals with stroke, loading has a significant effect on
their ability to generate quick coordinated motion. With increases in loading,
their overall task performance decreases and they are less able to compensate
for ball dynamics---frequency analysis of their motion indicates that abduction
loading weakens their ability to generate movements at the resonant frequency
of the dynamic task. This effect is likely due to an increased reliance on
lower resolution indirect motor pathways in individuals post stroke. Given the
inter-dependency of loading and dynamic task performance, we can create
targeted robot-aided training protocols focused on improving timing-sensitive
motor control, similar to existing progressive loading therapies, which have
shown efficacy for expanding reachable workspace post stroke.

expected voltage that a healthy cell would present and compare it with the
cell's measured voltage in real-time. This approach is possible because, when a
fault is about to happen, the cell's measured voltage differs from the one
expected for the same operating conditions. However, estimating the expected
voltage is challenging, as the voltage of a healthy cell is also affected by
its degradation -- an unknown parameter. Expert-defined parametric models are
currently used for this estimation task. Instead, we propose the use of a
neural network model based on an encoder-decoder architecture. The network
receives the operating conditions as input. The encoder's task is to find a
faithful representation of the cell's degradation and to pass it to the
decoder, which in turn predicts the expected cell's voltage. As no labeled
degradation data is given to the network, we consider our approach to be a
self-supervised encoder. Results show that we were able to predict the voltage
of multiple cells while diminishing the prediction error that was obtained by
the parametric models by 53%. This improvement enabled our network to predict a
fault 31 hours before it happened, a 64% increase in reaction time compared to
the parametric model. Moreover, the output of the encoder can be plotted,
adding interpretability to the neural network model.
