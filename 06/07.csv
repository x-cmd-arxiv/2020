  Magazine",,,,"cs.DC cs.LG cs.NI stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Machine learning (ML) tasks are becoming ubiquitous in today's network
applications. Federated learning has emerged recently as a technique for
training ML models at the network edge by leveraging processing capabilities
across the nodes that collect the data. There are several challenges with
employing conventional federated learning in contemporary networks, due to the
significant heterogeneity in compute and communication capabilities that exist
across devices. To address this, we advocate a new learning paradigm called fog
learning which will intelligently distribute ML model training across the
continuum of nodes from edge devices to cloud servers. Fog learning enhances
federated learning along three major dimensions: network, heterogeneity, and
proximity. It considers a multi-layer hybrid learning framework consisting of
heterogeneous devices with various proximities. It accounts for the topology
structures of the local networks among the heterogeneous nodes at each network
layer, orchestrating them for collaborative/cooperative learning through
device-to-device (D2D) communications. This migrates from star network
topologies used for parameter transfers in federated learning to more
distributed topologies at scale. We discuss several open research directions to
realizing fog learning.

  Security and Reliability Analysis",,,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Physical layer security is known as a promising paradigm to ensure security
for the beyond 5G (B5G) networks in the presence of eavesdroppers. In this
paper, we elaborate on a tractable analysis framework to evaluate the
reliability and security of wireless-powered decode-and-forward (DF)
multi-relay networks. The nonlinear energy harvesters, in-phase and
quadrature-phase imbalance (IQI) and channel estimation errors (CEEs) are taken
into account in the considered system. To further improve the secure
performance, two relay selection strategies are presented: 1) suboptimal relay
selection (SRS); 2) optimal relay selection (ORS). Specifically, exact
analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and the intercept
probability (IP) are derived in closed-form. For the IP, we consider that the
eavesdropper can wiretap the signal from the source or the relay. In order to
obtain more useful insights, we carry out the asymptotic analysis and diversity
orders for the OP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime under
non-ideal and ideal conditions. Numerical results show that: 1) Although the
mismatches of amplitude/phase of transmitter (TX)/receiver (RX) limit the OP
performance, it can enhance IP performance; 2) Large number of relays yields
better OP performance; 3) There are error floors for the OP because of the
CEEs; 4) There is a trade-off for the OP and IO to obtain the balance between
reliability and security.

However, malicious users often exploit shared pictures to create fake profiles
leading to the growth of cybercrime. Thus, keeping in mind this scenario,
authorship attribution and verification through image watermarking techniques
are becoming more and more important. In this paper, firstly, we investigate
how 13 most popular SNs treat the uploaded pictures, in order to identify a
possible implementation of image watermarking techniques by respective SNs.
Secondly, on these 13 SNs, we test the robustness of several image watermarking
algorithms. Finally, we verify whether a method based on the Photo-Response
Non-Uniformity (PRNU) technique can be successfully used as a watermarking
approach for authorship attribution and verification of pictures on SNs. The
proposed method is robust enough in spite of the fact that the pictures get
downgraded during the uploading process by SNs. The results of our analysis on
a real dataset of 8,400 pictures show that the proposed method is more
effective than other watermarking techniques and can help to address serious
questions about privacy and security on SNs.

dynamical control systems. As control systems are becoming increasingly complex

without structural knowledge, these methods are prone to finding spurious
correlations in the training data, which can hamper generalization capabilities
of the obtained models. This can significantly lower control and prediction
performance when the system is exposed to unknown situations. A preceding
causal identification can prevent this pitfall. In this paper, we propose a
method that identifies the causal structure of control systems. We design
experiments based on the concept of controllability, which provides a
systematic way to compute input trajectories that steer the system to specific
regions in its state space. We then analyze the resulting data leveraging
powerful techniques from causal inference and extend them to control systems.
Further, we derive conditions that guarantee the discovery of the true causal
structure of the system. Experiments on a robot arm demonstrate reliable causal
identification from real-world data and enhanced generalization capabilities.

technique of embedding a transparent message into an image in a way that allows
retrieving the message from a (perturbed) copy, so that copyright infringement
can be tracked. For this technique, it is essential to extract the information
from the image even after imposing some digital processing operations on it.
Our framework outperforms recent methods in the context of robustness against
not only spectrum of attacks (e.g. rotation, resizing, Gaussian smoothing) but
also against compression, especially JPEG. The bit accuracy of our method is at
least 0.86 for all types of distortions. We also achieved 0.90 bit accuracy for
JPEG while recent methods provided at most 0.83. Our method retains high
transparency and capacity as well. Moreover, we present our double
detector-discriminator approach - a scheme to detect and discriminate if the
image contains the embedded message or not, which is crucial for real-life
watermarking systems and up to now was not investigated using neural networks.
With this, we design a testing formula to validate our extended approach and
compared it with a common procedure. We also present an alternative method of
balancing between image quality and robustness on attacks which is easily
applicable to the framework.

of coexisting agents interact with one another and their environment. The
adaptation and learning of other agents induces non-stationarity in the
environment dynamics. This poses a great challenge for value function-based
algorithms whose convergence usually relies on the assumption of a stationary
environment. Policy search algorithms also struggle in multi-agent settings as
the partial observability resulting from an opponent's actions not being known
introduces high variance to policy training. Modelling an agent's opponent(s)
is often pursued as a means of resolving the issues arising from the
coexistence of learning opponents. An opponent model provides an agent with
some ability to reason about other agents to aid its own decision making. Most
prior works learn an opponent model by assuming the opponent is employing a
stationary policy or switching between a set of stationary policies. Such an
approach can reduce the variance of training signals for policy search
algorithms. However, in the multi-agent setting, agents have an incentive to
continually adapt and learn. This means that the assumptions concerning
opponent stationarity are unrealistic. In this work, we develop a novel
approach to modelling an opponent's learning dynamics which we term Learning to
Model Opponent Learning (LeMOL). We show our structured opponent model is more
accurate and stable than naive behaviour cloning baselines. We further show
that opponent modelling can improve the performance of algorithmic agents in
multi-agent settings.

uncertainties induced by measurement noise and modeling error. Sparse
representation can be used to perform inverse analysis for the case of sparse
damage. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage sensitivity analysis-based
framework for both model updating and sparse damage identification.
Specifically, an $\ell_2$ Bayesian learning method is firstly developed for
updating the intact model and uncertainty quantification so as to set forward a
baseline for damage detection. A sparse representation pipeline built on a
quasi-$\ell_0$ method, e.g., Sequential Threshold Least Squares (STLS)
regression, is then presented for damage localization and quantification.
Additionally, Bayesian optimization together with cross validation is developed
to heuristically learn hyperparameters from data, which saves the computational
cost of hyperparameter tuning and produces more reliable identification result.
The proposed framework is verified by three examples, including a 10-story
shear-type building, a complex truss structure, and a shake table test of an
eight-story steel frame. Results show that the proposed approach is capable of
both localizing and quantifying structural damage with high accuracy.

topological features emerge during the merger, and marginally trapped surfaces

the physical and geometric aspects of this scenario. For the case of a head-on
collision of non-spinning black holes, we study in detail the world tube formed

properties and is generally more complex than considered previously in the
literature. The dynamical horizons are shown to have mixed signature and are
not future marginally trapped everywhere. We analyze the area increase of the
marginal surfaces along a sequence which connects the two initially disjoint
horizons with the final common horizon. While the area does increase overall
along this sequence, it is not monotonic. We find short durations of anomalous
area change which, given the connection of area with entropy, might have
interesting physical consequences. We investigate the possible reasons for this

of energy which cross the horizon and cause the area to change. We construct a
natural coordinate system on the horizon and decompose the various fields
appearing in the flux, primarily the shear of the outgoing null normal, in spin
weighted spherical harmonics. For each of the modes we extract the decay rates
as the final black hole approaches equilibrium. The late part of the decay is
consistent with the expected quasi-normal mode frequencies, while the early
part displays a much steeper fall-off. Similarly, we calculate the decay of the
horizon multipole moments, again finding two different regimes. Finally,
seeking an explanation for this behavior, motivated by the membrane paradigm
interpretation, we attempt to identify the different dynamical timescales of

itself by using Time-cost Regularization. Additionally, we propose a method to
learn blackbox parameters such as which blackbox solver to use or the heuristic
function for a particular solver. We do this by introducing the idea of a
hyper-blackbox which is a blackbox around one or more internal blackboxes.

intersectional biases show that CEAT finds evidence of all tested biases and
provides comprehensive information on the variance of effect magnitudes of the

Emergent Intersectional Bias Detection (EIBD), to automatically identify the
intersectional biases and emergent intersectional biases from static word
embeddings in addition to measuring them in contextualized word embeddings. We
present the first algorithmic bias detection findings on how intersectional
group members are strongly associated with unique emergent biases that do not

even for moderate numbers of variables; drawing one sample using the existing
algorithms is more expensive than a function evaluation for many black-box
functions of interest. To address this problem, we propose a computationally
efficient model learning algorithm based on multilinear polynomials and
exponential weight updates. In the proposed algorithm, we alternate between
simulated annealing with respect to the current polynomial representation and
updating the weights using monomial experts' advice. Numerical experiments on
various datasets in both unconstrained and sum-constrained boolean optimization
indicate the competitive performance of the proposed algorithm, while improving
the computational time up to several orders of magnitude compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms in the literature.

can provide new insights into how they learn internal representations. This
paper argues that acquisition of speech can be modeled as a dependency between
random space and generated speech data in the Generative Adversarial Network
architecture and proposes a methodology to uncover the network's internal
representations that correspond to phonetic and phonological properties. The
Generative Adversarial architecture is uniquely appropriate for modeling
phonetic and phonological learning because the network is trained on
unannotated raw acoustic data and learning is unsupervised without any
language-specific assumptions or pre-assumed levels of abstraction. A
Generative Adversarial Network was trained on an allophonic distribution in
English. The network successfully learns the allophonic alternation: the
network's generated speech signal contains the conditional distribution of
aspiration duration. The paper proposes a technique for establishing the
network's internal representations that identifies latent variables that
correspond to, for example, presence of [s] and its spectral properties. By
manipulating these variables, we actively control the presence of [s] and its
frication amplitude in the generated outputs. This suggests that the network
learns to use latent variables as an approximation of phonetic and phonological
representations. Crucially, we observe that the dependencies learned in
training extend beyond the training interval, which allows for additional
exploration of learning representations. The paper also discusses how the
network's architecture and innovative outputs resemble and differ from
linguistic behavior in language acquisition, speech disorders, and speech
errors, and how well-understood dependencies in speech data can help us
interpret how neural networks learn their representations.

way to use distributional information about X|Z to exactly (non-asymptotically)
control Type-I error using any test statistic in any dimensionality without
assuming anything about Y|(X,Z). This flexibility in principle allows one to
derive powerful test statistics from complex prediction algorithms while
maintaining statistical validity. Yet the direct use of such advanced test
statistics in the CRT is prohibitively computationally expensive, especially
with multiple testing, due to the CRT's requirement to recompute the test
statistic many times on resampled data. We propose the distilled CRT, a novel
approach to using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in the CRT while
drastically reducing the number of times those algorithms need to be run,
thereby taking advantage of their power and the CRT's statistical guarantees
without suffering the usual computational expense. In addition to distillation,
we propose a number of other tricks like screening and recycling computations
to further speed up the CRT without sacrificing its high power and exact
validity. Indeed, we show in simulations that all our proposals combined lead
to a test that has similar power to the most powerful existing CRT
implementations but requires orders of magnitude less computation, making it a
practical tool even for large data sets. We demonstrate these benefits on a

linear spatio-temporal stochastic model for tropical precipitation, used to
describe the dynamics of water vapor and tropical convection. By taking into
account that shallow stratiform clouds are close to a self-organized
criticallity and that water vapor content is the order parameter, it is
observed that sources must have non-linear terms in the equation to include the
dynamical feedback due to precipitation and evaporation. The inclusion of this
non-linearity leads to a kind of time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau stochastic
equation, originally used to describe superconductivity phases. By performing
numerical simulations, pattern formation is observed, specially for cellular
convective phases. These patterns are much better compared with real satellite
observations than the pure linear model. This is done by comparing the spatial
Fourier transform of real and numerical cloud fields. Finally, by considering
fluctuation terms for the turbulent eddy diffusion we arrive to a
Hohenberg-Swift equation. The obtained patterns are much more organized that
the patterns obtained from the Ginzburg-Landau equation in the case of closed

indispensable outreach tool, including for applications where it is desirable
to engage different demographics in an equitable fashion, such as hiring,
housing, civic processes, and public health outreach efforts. Somewhat
surprisingly, the existing online advertising ecosystem provides very little
support for advertising to (and recruiting) a demographically representative
cohort.
  We study the problem of advertising for demographic representativeness from
both an empirical and algorithmic perspective. In essence, we seek fairness in
the outcome or conversions generated by the advertising campaigns. We first
present detailed empirical findings from real-world experiments for recruiting
for civic processes, using which we show that methods using Facebook-inferred
features are too inaccurate for achieving equity in outcomes, while targeting
via custom audiences based on a list of registered voters segmented on known
attributes has much superior accuracy.
  This motivates us to consider the algorithmic question of optimally
segmenting the list of individuals with known attributes into a few custom
campaigns and allocating budgets to them so that we cost-effectively achieve
outcome parity with the population on the maximum possible number of
demographics. Under the assumption that a platform can reasonably enforce
proportionality in spend across demographics, we present efficient exact and
approximation algorithms for this problem. We present simulation results on our
datasets to show the efficacy of these algorithms in achieving demographic
parity.

future with effortless driving and virtually no traffic accidents. AV companies
claim that, when fully developed, the technology will eliminate 94% of all
accidents that are caused by human error. These AVs will likely avoid the large
number of crashes caused by impaired, distracted or reckless drivers. But there
remains a significant proportion of crashes for which no driver is directly
responsible. In particular, the absence of connectivity of an AV with its
neighboring vehicles (V2V) and the infrastructure (I2V) leads to a lack of
information that can induce such crashes. Since AV designs today do not require
such connectivity, these crashes would persist in the future. Using
prototypical examples motivated by the NHTSA pre-crash scenario typology, we
show that fully autonomous vehicles cannot guarantee safety in the absence of
connectivity. Combining theoretical models and empirical data, we also argue
that such hazardous scenarios will occur with a significantly high probability.
This suggests that incorporating connectivity is an essential step on the path
towards safe AV technology.

Fourier transform, Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), wavelet scalogram,

Hurst exponent ($H$), and the $\mathcal{A}-\mathcal{T}$ plane. First, with
extensive simulations we showed that parametric modeling returns unreliable
parameters, with a high dispersion for different realizations of the same
stochastic model. Hence any such analysis should be supported with Monte Carlo
simulations. For our blazar sample, we find that the power law indices $\beta$
calculated from the Fourier and LSP modeling mostly fall in the range
$1\lesssim\beta\lesssim 2$. Using the wavelet scalograms, we confirm a
quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in PKS~2155$-$304 at a $3\sigma$ significance
level, but do not detect any QPOs in other objects. The ARMA fits reached
higher orders for 7-day binned LCs and lower orders for 10- and 14-days binned
LCs for the majority of blazars, suggesting there might exist a characteristic
timescale for the perturbations in the jet and/or accretion disk to die out.
ARMA and CARMA modeling revealed breaks in their PSDs at timescales of few
hundred days. The estimation of $H$ was performed with several methods. We find
that most blazars exhibit $H > 0.5$, indicating long-term memory. Finally, the
FSRQ and BL Lac subclasses are clearly separated in the

Mech.), we study the stability of a liquid metal flow in a rectangular,
electrically insulating duct with a steady homogeneous transverse magnetic
field. The Lorentz force tends to eliminate velocity variations along the
magnetic field, leading to a quasi-two dimensional base flow with Hartmann
boundary layers near the walls perpendicular to the magnetic field, and
Shercliff layers near the walls parallel to the field. Since the Lorentz force
strongly opposes the growth of perturbations with a dependence along the
magnetic field direction too, we represent the flow with Sommeria \& Moreau's
(1982, J. Fluid Mech.) model, a two-dimensional shallow water model with linear
friction accounting for the effect of the Hartmann layer.
  The simplicity of this model makes it possible to study the stability and
transient growth of quasi-two dimensional perturbations over an extensive range
of parameters up to the limit of high magnetic fields, where the Reynolds
number based on the Shercliff layer thickness $Re/H^{1/2}$ becomes the only
relevant parameter. Tollmien-Schlichting waves are the most linearly unstable
mode, with a further unstable mode $H \gtrsim 42$. The flow is linearly
unstable for $Re/H^{1/2}\gtrsim 48350$ and energetically stable for
$Re/H^{1/2}\lesssim 65.32$. Between these two bounds, non-modal quasi-two
dimensional perturbations undergo significant transient growth (between 2 and 7
times more than in the case of a purely 2D Poiseuille flow, and for much more
subcritical values of $Re$). In the limit of a high magnetic field, the maximum
gain $G_{max}$ associated to this transient growth varies as $G_{max} \sim
(Re/Re_c)^{2/3}$ and occurs at time $t_{Gmax}\sim(Re/Re_c)^{1/3}$ for
streamwise wavenumbers of the same order of magnitude as the critical
wavenumber for the linear stability.

technique which allows for the modification of oxygen concentration in VOX thin
films by carefully tuning thermodynamic conditions. We were able to control the
evolution between VO2, V3O5, and V2O3 phases on sapphire substrates, overcoming
the narrow phase stability of adjacent Magn\'eli phases. A variety of annealing
routes were found to achieve the desired phases and eventually to control the
metal-insulator transition (MIT). The pronounced MIT of the transformed films
along with the detailed structural investigations based on x-ray diffraction

obtained and stabilized. Using this technique, we find that the thin film V-O

empirical data is of great importance in many scientific and engineering
disciplines that use computational models (such as a digital twin) for the
analysis and prediction of complex physical processes. However, fast and
accurate inference for processes with large and high dimensional datasets
cannot easily be achieved with state-of-the-art methods under noisy real-world
conditions. The primary reason is that the inference of model parameters with
traditional techniques based on optimisation or sampling often suffers from
computational and statistical challenges, resulting in a trade-off between
accuracy and deployment time. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for
inference of model parameters based on reinforcement learning. The contribution
of the paper is twofold: 1) We reformulate the inference problem as a tracking
problem with the objective of learning a policy that forces the response of the
physics-based model to follow the observations; 2) We propose the constrained
Lyapunov-based actor-critic (CLAC) algorithm to enable the robust and accurate
inference of physics-based model parameters in real time under noisy real-world
conditions. The proposed methodology is demonstrated and evaluated on two
model-based diagnostics test cases utilizing two different physics-based models
of turbofan engines. The performance of the methodology is compared to that of
two alternative approaches: a state update method (unscented Kalman filter) and
a supervised end-to-end mapping with deep neural networks. The experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed methodology outperforms all other tested
methods in terms of speed and robustness, with high inference accuracy.

maps (DM), and its local kernel variants, to approximate second-order
differential operators defined on smooth manifolds with boundaries that
naturally arise in elliptic PDE models. To achieve this goal, we introduce the
Ghost Point Diffusion Maps (GPDM) estimator on an extended manifold, identified
by the set of point clouds on the unknown original manifold together with a set
of ghost points, specified along the estimated tangential direction at the
sampled points at the boundary. The resulting GPDM estimator restricts the
standard DM matrix to a set of extrapolation equations that estimates the
function values at the ghost points. This adjustment is analogous to the
classical ghost point method in finite-difference scheme for solving PDEs on
flat domain. As opposed to the classical DM which diverges near the boundary,
the proposed GPDM estimator converges pointwise even near the boundary.
Applying the consistent GPDM estimator to solve the well-posed elliptic PDEs
with classical boundary conditions (Dirichlet, Neumann, and Robin), we
establish the convergence of the approximate solution under appropriate
smoothness assumptions. We numerically validate the proposed mesh-free PDE
solver on various problems defined on simple sub-manifolds embedded in
Euclidean spaces as well as on an unknown manifold. Numerically, we also found
that the GPDM is more accurate compared to DM in solving elliptic eigenvalue
problems on bounded smooth manifolds.

Furthermore, there are plans, that are guaranteed to achieve goals, where the
existing methods are unable to provide any action-based sensor. We identify the
underlying feature common to all such plans. Then, we show how to produce
action-based sensors even for plans where the existing treatment is inadequate,

methods usually produce undesired side effects (e.g., classification accuracy
drop, additional hyperparameters, slower inferences, and collecting extra
data). In the opposite direction, we propose replacing SoftMax loss with a
novel loss function that does not suffer from the mentioned weaknesses. The
proposed IsoMax loss is isotropic (exclusively distance-based) and provides
high entropy posterior probability distributions. Replacing the SoftMax loss by
IsoMax loss requires no model or training changes. Additionally, the models
trained with IsoMax loss produce as fast and energy-efficient inferences as
those trained using SoftMax loss. Moreover, no classification accuracy drop is
observed. The proposed method does not rely on outlier/background data,
hyperparameter tuning, temperature calibration, feature extraction, metric
learning, adversarial training, ensemble procedures, or generative models. Our
experiments showed that IsoMax loss works as a seamless SoftMax loss drop-in
replacement that significantly improves neural networks' OOD detection

combined with current or future OOD detection techniques to achieve even higher

of gravity, by properly constraining it with recent observational data. Here
basic aim is to study the properties of Gravitational Waves (GWs) in this new
model. In $f(R)$ gravity metric formalism, the model shows the existence of
scalar degree of freedom as like other $f(R)$ gravity models. Due to this
reason, there is a scalar mode of polarization of GWs present in the theory.
This polarization mode exists in a mixed state, of which one is transverse
massless breathing mode with non-vanishing trace and the other is massive
longitudinal mode. The longitudinal mode being massive, travels at speed less
than the usual tensor modes found in General Relativity (GR). Moreover, for a
better understanding of the model, we have studied the potential and mass of
scalar graviton in both Jordan frame and Einstein frame. This model can pass
the solar system tests and can explain primordial and present dark energy.
Also, we have put constraints on the model. It is found that the correlation
function for the third mode of polarization under certain mass scale predicted
by the model agrees well with the recent data of Pulsar Timing Arrays. It seems
that this new model would be useful in dealing with different existing issues

natural way to resolve this problem is to apply online stochastic gradient

the semiconductors' band gap, but are overtaken by a sharp CdS-related
absorption onset around 525 nm facilitating cQD excitation. The redshifted
photoluminescence emission is then minimally reabsorbed along the fiber with a
spectrum barely affected by the polymerization and a quantum yield staying at
$\sim$65$\%$ of its initial value. The latter, along with the glass transition
temperature and refractive index, is independent of the cQD concentration hence
yielding a proportionally increasing light output. Our cQD-doped fibers are

Provided the observed features are multi-valued, the statistical distance
function is still efficient. However, due to its scalar output, it cannot be
applied to represent detailed distances between feature elements. To resolve
this problem, this paper extends the traditional statistical distance to a
matrix form, called a statistical distance matrix. In experiments, the proposed

social distancing, and virus-contact tracing can greatly reduce the spread of
the virus during a pandemic. In the wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, many
countries have implemented various NPIs for infection control and mitigation.
However, the stringency of the NPIs and the resulting impact among different
countries remain unclear due to the lack of quantitative factors. In this study
we took a further step to incorporate the effect of the NPIs into the pandemic
dynamics model using the concept of policy intensity factor (PIF). This idea
enables us to characterize the transition rates as time varying quantities
instead of constant values, and thus capturing the dynamical behavior of the
basic reproduction number variation in the pandemic. By leveraging a great
amount of data reported by the governments and the World Health Organization,
we projected the dynamics of the pandemic for the major economies in the world,
including the numbers of infected, susceptible, and recovered cases, as well as
the pandemic durations. It is observed that the proposed variable-rate
susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (VR-SEIR) model fits and projects the
pandemic dynamics very well. We further showed that the resulting PIFs
correlate with the stringency of NPIs, which allows us to project the final
affected numbers of people in those countries when their current NPIs have been
imposed for 90, 180, 360 days. It provides a quantitative insight into the
effectiveness of the implemented NPIs, and sheds a new light on minimizing both
affected people from COVID-19 and the economic impact.

to derive a linear heating flow model, sacrificing optimality for computational
simplicity. This paper proposes a novel convex combined heat and power dispatch
model based on model simplification and constraint relaxation, which improves
solution quality and avoids assumptions on operating regimes of district
heating systems. To alleviate mathematical complexity introduced by the
commonly used node method, a simplified thermal dynamic model is proposed to
capture temperature changes in networked pipelines. Conic and polyhedral
relaxations are then applied to convexify the original problems with bilinear
and quadratic equality constraints. Furthermore, an adaptive solution algorithm
is proposed to successively reduce relaxation gaps based on dynamic bivariate
partitioning, improving solution optimality with desirable computational
efficiency. The proposed method is verified on a 33-bus electric power system
integrated with a 30-node district heating system and compared to nonlinear
programming solvers and constant-flow-based solutions.

highly influential IPW weights may lead to unstable IPW estimators, with biased
estimates and large variances. To mitigate these issues, a number of
alternative methods have been proposed, including IPW trimming, overlap weights
(OW), matching weights (MW), and entropy weights (EW). Because OW, MW, and EW
target the population for whom there is equipoise (and with adequate overlap)
and their estimands depend on the true PS, a common criticism is that these
estimators may be more sensitive to misspecifications of the PS model. In this
paper, we conduct extensive simulation studies to compare the performances of
IPW and IPW trimming against those of OW, MW, and EW under limited overlap and
misspecified propensity score models. Across the wide range of scenarios we
considered, OW, MW, and EW consistently outperform IPW in terms of bias, root
mean squared error, and coverage probability.

  coefficients",,,,,"math.DS nlin.AO q-bio.NC","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The brain produces rhythms in a variety of frequency bands. Some are likely
by-products of neuronal processes; others are thought to be top-down. Produced
entirely naturally, these rhythms have clearly recognizable beats, but they are
very far from periodic in the sense of mathematics. They produce signals that
are broad-band, episodic, wandering in magnitude, in frequency and in phase;
the rhythm comes and goes, degrading and regenerating. Rhythms with these
characteristics do not match standard dynamical systems paradigms of
periodicity, quasi-periodicity, or periodic motion in the presence of a
Brownian noise. Thus far they have been satisfactorily reproduced only using
networks of hundreds of integrate-and-fire neurons. In this paper, we tackle
the mathematical question of whether signals with these properties can be
generated from simpler dynamical systems. Using an ODE with two variables
inspired by the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, and varying randomly three parameters
that control the magnitude, frequency and degree of degradation, we were able
to replicate the qualitative characteristics of these natural brain rhythms.
Viewing the two variables as Excitatory and Inhibitory conductances of a
typical neuron in a local population, our model produces results that closely
resemble gamma-band activity in real cortex, including the moment-to-moment
balancing of E and I-currents seen in experiments.

the following sense:
  1. The rates for representing the class of functions $\mathcal{G}_D$ via $D$
ReLU layers is sharp up to constants, as shown by matching lower bounds.
  2. For each $D$, $\mathcal{G}_{D} \subseteq \mathcal{G}_{D+1}$ and as $D$
grows the class of functions $\mathcal{G}_{D}$ contains progressively less
smooth functions.
  3. If $D^{\prime} < D$, then the approximation rate for the class
$\mathcal{G}_D$ achieved by depth $D^{\prime}$ networks is strictly worse than
that achieved by depth $D$ networks.
  This constitutes a fine-grained characterization of the representation power
of feedforward networks of arbitrary depth $D$ and number of neurons $N$, in
contrast to existing representation results which either require $D$ growing
quickly with $N$ or assume that the function being represented is highly
smooth. In the latter case similar rates can be obtained with a single
nonlinear layer. Our results confirm the prevailing hypothesis that deeper
networks are better at representing less smooth functions, and indeed, the main
technical novelty is to fully exploit the fact that deep networks can produce
highly oscillatory functions with few activation functions.

presence of the delay imposes to assign the solution not just at the initial

approximator and has been widely used in a variety of areas. However, since the

infeasible to parallelize the training process among base learners for
speed-up. In addition, under online or incremental learning settings, GBMs
achieved sub-optimal performance due to the fact that the previously trained
base learners can not adapt with the environment once trained. In this work, we
propose the soft Gradient Boosting Machine (sGBM) by wiring multiple
differentiable base learners together, by injecting both local and global
objectives inspired from gradient boosting, all base learners can then be
jointly optimized with linear speed-up. When using differentiable soft decision

achieved great success in challenging tasks of deep reinforcement learning.
This teacher-student framework requires a well-trained teacher model which is
computationally expensive. Moreover, the performance of the student model could
be limited by the teacher model if the teacher model is not optimal. In the
light of collaborative learning, we study the feasibility of involving joint
intellectual efforts from diverse perspectives of student models. In this work,
we introduce dual policy distillation(DPD), a student-student framework in
which two learners operate on the same environment to explore different
perspectives of the environment and extract knowledge from each other to
enhance their learning. The key challenge in developing this dual learning
framework is to identify the beneficial knowledge from the peer learner for
contemporary learning-based reinforcement learning algorithms, since it is
unclear whether the knowledge distilled from an imperfect and noisy peer
learner would be helpful. To address the challenge, we theoretically justify
that distilling knowledge from a peer learner will lead to policy improvement
and propose a disadvantageous distillation strategy based on the theoretical
results. The conducted experiments on several continuous control tasks show
that the proposed framework achieves superior performance with a learning-based
agent and function approximation without the use of expensive teacher models.

Statistics in detecting anomalies on both offline data as well as real time
data. Our aim is to come up with an algorithm which can handle all types of

derive their context from the neighbouring observations. Also, we require a
methodology to automatically determine the presence of seasonality in the given

fitting approach rather than model based anomaly detection. The proposed model
also introduces a unique filter which assess the relative significance of local
outliers and removes the ones deemed as insignificant. Since, the proposed
model fits polynomial in buckets of timeseries data, it does not suffer from
problems such as heteroskedasticity and breakout as compared to its statistical
alternatives such as ARIMA, SARIMA and Winter Holt. Experimental results the

We show that we can pre-train the AE using paired RGB and depth images from

`cubification' of 3D space around the camera, where each cuboid is tasked with
predicting N object poses, along with their class and confidence values. The AE

groups of users have their own objectives (learning tasks) but by aggregating
their data with others in the same cluster (same learning task), they can
leverage the strength in numbers in order to perform more efficient federated
learning. For this new framework of clustered federated learning, we propose
the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), which alternately
estimates the cluster identities of the users and optimizes model parameters
for the user clusters via gradient descent. We analyze the convergence rate of
this algorithm first in a linear model with squared loss and then for generic
strongly convex and smooth loss functions. We show that in both settings, with
good initialization, IFCA is guaranteed to converge, and discuss the optimality
of the statistical error rate. In particular, for the linear model with two
clusters, we can guarantee that our algorithm converges as long as the
initialization is slightly better than random. When the clustering structure is
ambiguous, we propose to train the models by combining IFCA with the weight
sharing technique in multi-task learning. In the experiments, we show that our
algorithm can succeed even if we relax the requirements on initialization with
random initialization and multiple restarts. We also present experimental
results showing that our algorithm is efficient in non-convex problems such as

perturbations in the input graph using the notion of average sensitivity, which
is the expected size of the symmetric difference of the output clusters before

  We first prove that the average sensitivity of spectral clustering is
proportional to $\lambda_2/\lambda_3^2$, where $\lambda_i$ is the $i$-th

files that describe various events and users' activities. Analysis of these
logs might be used in many critical applications such as detecting
cyber-attacks, finding behavioral patterns of users, security incident
response, network forensics, etc. In a cellular network Call Detail Records
(CDR) is one type of such logs containing metadata of calls and usually
includes valuable information about contact such as the phone numbers of
originating and receiving subscribers, call duration, the area of activity,
type of call (SMS or voice call) and a timestamp. With anomaly detection, it is
possible to determine abnormal reduction or increment of network traffic in an
area or for a particular person. This paper's primary goal is to study
subscribers' behavior in a cellular network, mainly predicting the number of
calls in a region and detecting anomalies in the network traffic. In this
paper, a new hybrid method is proposed based on various anomaly detection
methods such as GARCH, K-means, and Neural Network to determine the anomalous
data. Moreover, we have discussed the possible causes of such anomalies.

our exploration shows that this method is viable and has much room for

  A Tangent Intersection and Target Guidance Strategy",,,,,"cs.RO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) path planning enables UAVs to avoid obstacles
and reach the target efficiently. To generate high-quality paths without
obstacle collision for UAVs, this paper proposes a novel autonomous path
planning algorithm based on a tangent intersection and target guidance strategy
(APPATT). Guided by a target, the elliptic tangent graph method is used to
generate two sub-paths, one of which is selected based on heuristic rules when
confronting an obstacle. The UAV flies along the selected sub-path and
repeatedly adjusts its flight path to avoid obstacles through this way until
the collision-free path extends to the target. Considering the UAV kinematic
constraints, the cubic B-spline curve is employed to smooth the waypoints for
obtaining a feasible path. Compared with A*, PRM, RRT and VFH, the experimental
results show that APPATT can generate the shortest collision-free path within
0.05 seconds for each instance under static environments. Moreover, compared
with VFH and RRTRW, APPATT can generate satisfactory collision-free paths under
uncertain environments in a nearly real-time manner. It is worth noting that
APPATT has the capability of escaping from simple traps within a reasonable
time.

exploit. The phenomenon of backflashes, whereby APDs reemit photons after
detecting a photon, gives Eve the opportunity to passively learn the
information carried by the detected photon without the need to actively
interact with the legitimate receiver, Bob. Whilst this has been observed in
slow-gated detectors, it has not been investigated in fast-gated APDs where it
has been posited that this effect would be lessened. Here, we perform the first
experiment to characterise the security threat that backflashes provide in a
GHz-gated self-differencing APD using the metric of information leakage. We
find that, indeed, the information leakage is lower than that reported for
slower-gated detectors and we show that its effect on the secure key rate is
negligible. We also relate the rate of backflash events to the APD dark
current, thereby suggesting their origin is the InP multiplication region in
the APD.

the spin relaxation is found: as the magnetic field becomes stronger, the spin
relaxation time first increases quadratically but then changes to a linear
dependence, before it eventually becomes oscillatory, whereby the longitudinal
and transverse times reach maximal values at even and odd filling Landau level
factors, respectively. We show that the suppression of spin relaxation is due
to the effect of electron gyration on the spin-orbit field, while the
oscillations correspond to oscillations of the density of states appearing at
low temperatures and high magnetic fields. The transition from quadratic to
linear dependence can be related to a transition from classical to Bohm
diffusion and reflects an anomalous behavior of the two-dimensional electron
gas analogous to that observed in magnetized plasmas.

  First, we consider monotone classes of graphs whose shallow minors have

players) take their decisions based on their own private information as well as
the actions of previous decision makers. Such decision making processes often
lead to what is known as the \emph{information cascade} or \emph{herding}
phenomenon. Specifically, a cascade develops when it seems rational for some
players to abandon their own private information and imitate the actions of
earlier players. The risk, however, is that if the initial decisions were
wrong, then the whole cascade will be wrong. Nonetheless, information cascade
are known to be fragile: there exists a sequence of \emph{revealing}
probabilities $\{p_{\ell}\}_{\ell\geq1}$, such that if with probability
$p_{\ell}$ player $\ell$ ignores the decisions of previous players, and rely on
his private information only, then wrong cascades can be avoided. Previous
related papers which study the fragility of information cascades always assume
that the revealing probabilities are known to all players perfectly, which
might be unrealistic in practice. Accordingly, in this paper we study a
mismatch model where players believe that the revealing probabilities are
$\{q_\ell\}_{\ell\in\mathbb{N}}$ when they truly are

active learning, Bayes optimal inference, Bayes optimal design, etc. Active
inference resolves the exploitation-exploration dilemma in relation to prior
preferences, by placing information gain on the same footing as reward or
value. In brief, active inference replaces value functions with functionals of
(Bayesian) beliefs, in the form of an expected (variational) free energy. In
this paper, we consider a sophisticated kind of active inference, using a
recursive form of expected free energy. Sophistication describes the degree to
which an agent has beliefs about beliefs. We consider agents with beliefs about
the counterfactual consequences of action for states of affairs and beliefs
about those latent states. In other words, we move from simply considering
beliefs about 'what would happen if I did that' to 'what would I believe about
what would happen if I did that'. The recursive form of the free energy
functional effectively implements a deep tree search over actions and outcomes
in the future. Crucially, this search is over sequences of belief states, as
opposed to states per se. We illustrate the competence of this scheme, using
numerical simulations of deep decision problems.

an envelope. When discussing how this core forms some divergences appear. First
scenarios of planet formation predict the accretion of km-sized bodies, called
planetesimals, while more recent works suggest growth by accretion of pebbles,
which are cm-sized objects. These two accretion models are often discussed
separately and we aim here at comparing the outcomes of the two models with
identical initial conditions. We use two distinct codes: one computing
planetesimal accretion, the other pebble accretion. Using a population
synthesis approach, we compare planet simulations and study the impact of the
two solid accretion models, focussing on the formation of single planets. We
find that the planetesimal model predicts the formation of more giant planets,
while the pebble accretion model forms more super-Earth mass planets. This is
due to the pebble isolation mass concept, which prevents planets formed by
pebble accretion to accrete gas efficiently before reaching Miso. This
translates into a population of planets that are not heavy enough to accrete a
consequent envelope but that are in a mass range where type I migration is very
efficient. We also find higher gas mass fractions for a given core mass for the
pebble model compared to the planetesimal one caused by luminosity differences.
This also implies planets with lower densities which could be confirmed
observationally. Focusing on giant planets, we conclude that the sensitivity of
their formation differs: for the pebble accretion model, the time at which the
embryos are formed, as well as the period over which solids are accreted
strongly impact the results, while for the planetesimal model it depends on the
planetesimal size and on the splitting in the amount of solids available to
form planetesimals.

attempt to address this issue. Besides FMTL, there exists another powerful but
under-exploited distributed machine learning technique, called Network Lasso
(NL), which is inherently related to FMTL but has its own unique features. In
this paper, we made an in-depth evaluation and comparison of these two

origin of the tiny neutrino mass and flavor mixing. After the electroweak
symmetry breaking the light neutrino mass is generated by the seesaw mechanism
which further ensures the mixings between the light neutrino and heavy neutral
lepton mass eigenstates. If the triplet fermions are around the electroweak
scale having sizable mixings with the SM sector allowed by the correct gauge

(ITCS 2018), asked whether the bit size of the coefficients in a branching
proof, which they named stabbing planes (SP) refutations, for the case of
polytopes derived from SAT formulas, can be assumed to be polynomial in $n$. We
resolve this question by showing that any branching proof can be recompiled so
that the integer disjunctions have coefficients of size at most $(n

analyses of pulsating subdwarf B stars. Standard routine that we have used
allowed us to select candidates for trapped modes that surely bear signatures
of non-uniform chemical profile inside the stars. We have also done statistical
analysis using collected spectroscopic and asteroseismic data of previously
known subdwarf B stars along with our three stars. Making use of high precision
trigonometric parallaxes from the Gaia mission and spectral energy

masses and luminosities are close to their canonical values for extreme
horizontal branch stars. In particular, the stellar masses are close to the

  Unsupervised Cross-Domain Compression",,,,,"cs.CV cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Despite the recent progress of network pruning, directly applying it to the
Internet of Things (IoT) applications still faces two challenges, i.e. the
distribution divergence between end and cloud data and the missing of data
label on end devices. One straightforward solution is to combine the
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) technique and pruning. For example, the
model is first pruned on the cloud and then transferred from cloud to end by
UDA. However, such a naive combination faces high performance degradation.
Hence this work proposes an Adversarial Double Masks based Pruning (ADMP) for
such cross-domain compression. In ADMP, we construct a Knowledge Distillation
framework not only to produce pseudo labels but also to provide a measurement
of domain divergence as the output difference between the full-size teacher and
the pruned student. Unlike existing mask-based pruning works, two adversarial
masks, i.e. soft and hard masks, are adopted in ADMP. So ADMP can prune the
model effectively while still allowing the model to extract strong
domain-invariant features and robust classification boundaries. During
training, the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method is used to overcome the
binary constraint of {0,1}-masks. On Office31 and ImageCLEF-DA datasets, the
proposed ADMP can prune 60% channels with only 0.2% and 0.3% average accuracy
loss respectively. Compared with the state of art, we can achieve about 1.63x
parameters reduction and 4.1% and 5.1% accuracy improvement.

exploits multicontrast (MC), multicoil, and compressed sensing (CS)
redundancies in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
  Approach: CS, MC acquisition, and parallel imaging (PI) have been
individually well developed, but the combination of the three has not been
equally well studied, much less the potential benefits of isotropy within such
a setting. Inspired by total variation theory, we introduce an isotropic MC
image regularizer and attain its full potential by integrating it into
compressed MC multicoil MRI. A convex optimization problem is posed to model
the new variational framework and a first-order algorithm is developed to solve
the problem.
  Results: It turns out that the proposed isotropic regularizer outperforms
many of the state-of-the-art reconstruction methods not only in terms of
rotation-invariance preservation of symmetrical features, but also in
suppressing noise or streaking artifacts, which are normally encountered in PI
methods at aggressive undersampling rates. Moreover, the new framework
significantly prevents intercontrast leakage of contrast-specific details,
which seems to be a difficult situation to handle for some variational and
low-rank MC reconstruction approaches.
  Conclusions: The new framework is a viable option for image reconstruction in
fast protocols of MC parallel MRI, potentially reducing patient discomfort in
otherwise long and time-consuming scans.

which a two-level system (qubit) is embedded on a movable membrane. The qubit
can either be a defect which interacts with the mechanical oscillator via the
linear Jaynes-Cummings interaction or a superconducting charge qubit coupled
with the mechanical mode via nonlinear interaction. We find that coherent
perfect transmission (CPT), coherent perfect synthesis (CPS) and
optomechanically induced absorption (OMIA) can be generated by suitably
adjusting the system parameters. We find that the qubit and its interaction
with the mechanical oscillator emerges as a new handle to control these quantum
optical properties. The presence of the qubit results in four points where CPT
and CPS can be realized compared to the pure optomechanical case (i.e. in the
absence of qubit) where only three points are attained. This shows that the
presence of the qubit gives us more flexibility in choosing the appropriate
parameter regime where CPT and CPS can be attained and controlled. We also find
that OMIA shows three distinct peaks both in the linear and nonlinear cases. In
the absence of the qubit, OMIA is converted to optomechanically induced
transmission (OMIT). An increase in in the qubit decay rate also shows a
transition from OMIA to OMIT. Our study reveals that the optical response of
the nonlinear case is relatively rapid (more sensitive) compared to the linear
case to changes in the system parameters. This demonstrates the potential use
of this hybrid system in designing tunable all-optical-switch and photon-router

MasterTwo facilitates this task. It automatically calculates all loop integrals
reducible to scalar integrals depending on up to two different masses
independent of external momenta. MasterTwo consists of two sub packages,
Fermions and Integrals. Whereas Fermions covers the standard Dirac Algebra,
Integrals performs the Taylor expansion, partial fraction, tensor reduction and
the integration of the thus achieved scalar integrals. The package works
completely inside Mathematica and can be easily customised for both educational

Various studies have focused on sparse LP algorithms by introducing sparsity
constraints into the LP framework. Sparse LP has been shown to be effective in
several issues related to speech modeling and coding. However, all existing
approaches assume the speech signal to be minimum-phase. Because speech is
known to be mixed-phase, the resulting residual signal contains a persistent
maximum-phase component. The aim of this paper is to propose a novel technique
which incorporates a modeling of the maximum-phase contribution of speech, and
can be applied to any filter representation. The proposed method is shown to
significantly increase the sparsity of the LP residual signal and to be
effective in two illustrative applications: speech polarity detection and
excitation modeling.

textures from a low-resolution (LR) image. Recent progress has been made by
taking high-resolution images as references (Ref), so that relevant textures
can be transferred to LR images. However, existing SR approaches neglect to use
attention mechanisms to transfer high-resolution (HR) textures from Ref images,
which limits these approaches in challenging cases. In this paper, we propose a
novel Texture Transformer Network for Image Super-Resolution (TTSR), in which
the LR and Ref images are formulated as queries and keys in a transformer,
respectively. TTSR consists of four closely-related modules optimized for image
generation tasks, including a learnable texture extractor by DNN, a relevance
embedding module, a hard-attention module for texture transfer, and a
soft-attention module for texture synthesis. Such a design encourages joint
feature learning across LR and Ref images, in which deep feature
correspondences can be discovered by attention, and thus accurate texture
features can be transferred. The proposed texture transformer can be further
stacked in a cross-scale way, which enables texture recovery from different
levels (e.g., from 1x to 4x magnification). Extensive experiments show that
TTSR achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art approaches on both
quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

partial differential equations (PDEs) by deep learning. For example, deep
Galerkin method (DGM) uses the PDE residual in the least-squares sense as the
loss function and a deep neural network (DNN) to approximate the PDE solution.
In this work, we propose a deep mixed residual method (MIM) to solve PDEs with
high-order derivatives. In MIM, we first rewrite a high-order PDE into a
first-order system, very much in the same spirit as local discontinuous
Galerkin method and mixed finite element method in classical numerical methods
for PDEs. We then use the residual of first-order system in the least-squares
sense as the loss function, which is in close connection with least-squares
finite element method. For aforementioned classical numerical methods, the
choice of trail and test functions is important for stability and accuracy
issues in many cases. MIM shares this property when DNNs are employed to
approximate unknowns functions in the first-order system. In one case, we use
nearly the same DNN to approximate all unknown functions and in the other case,
we use totally different DNNs for different unknown functions. In most cases,
MIM provides better approximations (not only for high-derivatives of the PDE
solution but also for the PDE solution itself) than DGM with nearly the same
DNN and the same execution time, sometimes by more than one order of magnitude.
When different DNNs are used, in many cases, MIM provides even better
approximations than MIM with only one DNN, sometimes by more than one order of
magnitude. Therefore, we expect MIM to open up a possibly systematic way to
understand and improve deep learning for solving PDEs from the perspective of
classical numerical analysis.

distillation alleviates this limitation by collaborative learning, mutual

fashion. However, collaborative learning and mutual learning fail to construct
an online high-capacity teacher, whilst online ensembling ignores the
collaboration among branches and its logit summation impedes the further
optimisation of the ensemble teacher. In this work, we propose a novel Peer
Collaborative Learning method for online knowledge distillation, which
integrates online ensembling and network collaboration into a unified
framework. Specifically, given a target network, we construct a multi-branch
network for training, in which each branch is called a peer. We perform random
augmentation multiple times on the inputs to peers and assemble feature
representations outputted from peers with an additional classifier as the peer
ensemble teacher. This helps to transfer knowledge from a high-capacity teacher
to peers, and in turn further optimises the ensemble teacher. Meanwhile, we
employ the temporal mean model of each peer as the peer mean teacher to
collaboratively transfer knowledge among peers, which helps each peer to learn
richer knowledge and facilitates to optimise a more stable model with better
generalisation. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show
that the proposed method significantly improves the generalisation of various
backbone networks and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

decentralised learning from non-shared private training data distributed at
multiple user sites of independent multi-domain label spaces. We propose a
novel paradigm called Federated Person Re-Identification (FedReID) to construct
a generalisable global model (a central server) by simultaneously learning with
multiple privacy-preserved local models (local clients). Specifically, each
local client receives global model updates from the server and trains a local
model using its local data independent from all the other clients. Then, the
central server aggregates transferrable local model updates to construct a
generalisable global feature embedding model without accessing local data so to
preserve local privacy. This client-server collaborative learning process is
iteratively performed under privacy control, enabling FedReID to realise
decentralised learning without sharing distributed data nor collecting any
centralised data. Extensive experiments on ten Re-ID benchmarks show that
FedReID achieves compelling generalisation performance beyond any locally
trained models without using shared training data, whilst inherently protects
the privacy of each local client. This is uniquely advantageous over
contemporary Re-ID methods.

online recommender systems. While the large volume of implicit feedback
alleviates the data sparsity issue, the downside is that they are not as clean
in reflecting the actual satisfaction of users. For example, in E-commerce, a
large portion of clicks do not translate to purchases, and many purchases end
up with negative reviews. As such, it is of critical importance to account for
the inevitable noises in implicit feedback for recommender training. However,
little work on recommendation has taken the noisy nature of implicit feedback
into consideration.
  In this work, we explore the central theme of denoising implicit feedback for
recommender training. We find serious negative impacts of noisy implicit
feedback,i.e., fitting the noisy data prevents the recommender from learning
the actual user preference. Our target is to identify and prune noisy
interactions, so as to improve the quality of recommender training. By
observing the process of normal recommender training, we find that noisy
feedback typically has large loss values in the early stages. Inspired by this
observation, we propose a new training strategy namedAdaptive Denoising
Training(ADT), which adaptively prunes noisy interactions during training.
Specifically, we devise two paradigms for adaptive loss formulation: Truncated
Loss that discards the large-loss samples with a dynamic threshold in each
iteration; and reweighted Loss that adaptively lowers the weight of large-loss
samples. We instantiate the two paradigms on the widely used binary
cross-entropy loss and test the proposed ADT strategies on three representative
recommenders. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that ADT
significantly improves the quality of recommendation over normal training.

Auto-encoder-based VC methods disentangle the speaker and the content in input
speech without given the speaker's identity, so these methods can further
generalize to unseen speakers. The disentangle capability is achieved by vector
quantization (VQ), adversarial training, or instance normalization (IN).
However, the imperfect disentanglement may harm the quality of output speech.
In this work, to further improve audio quality, we use the U-Net architecture
within an auto-encoder-based VC system. We find that to leverage the U-Net

online reconstruction stage during data taking enabling detector calibration,
and a posterior calibrated asynchronous reconstruction stage. The significant
increase in the data rate poses challenges for online and offline
reconstruction as well as for data compression. Compared to Run 2, the online
farm must process 50 times more events per second and achieve a higher data
compression factor. ALICE will rely on GPUs to perform real time processing and
data compression of the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) detector in real time,
the biggest contributor to the data rate. With GPUs available in the online
farm, we are evaluating their usage also for the full tracking chain during the
asynchronous reconstruction for the silicon Inner Tracking System (ITS) and
Transition Radiation Detector (TRD). The software is written in a generic way,
such that it can also run on processors on the WLCG with the same
reconstruction output. We give an overview of the status and the current
performance of the reconstruction and the data compression implementations on
the GPU for the TPC and for the global reconstruction.

interactions of active objects (AOs) with inanimate matter, which often lead to
a range of rich behaviour. We present a range of simulations of the interaction
of a self-energised AO with three-dimensional granular matter and develop a
first-principles theoretical model to describe the observed phenomena. The AO
oscillates horizontally, which causes it to either rise against gravity or
sink, depending on the oscillation amplitude and frequency. We identify two
competing mechanisms that drive the vertical motion. When the AO moves below a
critical speed, $v_c$, it generates a jammed stagnant zone ahead of it, which
effects an upward force and leads to the rise. Above $v_c$ and certain kinetic
energy, the medium around the AO fluidises and the AO sinks into the layer
supporting it. The duration of the rising and sinking phases depend
non-trivially on the AO's amplitude and frequency leading to an intricate
nonlinear dynamics. We derive the equation of motion for the time-dependent
depth from first-principles and show that its solutions agree well with a wide
range of computer simulations, which we perform within the range of parameters
allowed by the finiteness of the simulated system.

probabilistic correspondences between nodes of source and target graphs via a
quadratic programming relaxation of the node matching problem. Our results
utilize and connect the observations that the GW geometric structure remains

was to compute GW correspondences from a source graph to a template graph with
isolated, self-connected nodes. We show that when comparing against a two-node
template graph using the heat kernel at the infinite time limit, the resulting
partition agrees with the partition produced by the Fiedler vector. This in

significant attention and achieved start-of-the-art performances on various

recursive aggregations among all related nodes, which arises severe
computational burden. Moreover, they favor multi-layer architectures in
conjunction with complicated modeling techniques. Though effective, the
excessive amount of model parameters largely hinder their applications in
real-world recommender systems. To this end, in this paper, we propose the
single-layer GCN model which is able to achieve superior performance along with
remarkably less complexity compared with existing models. Our main contribution
is three-fold. First, we propose a principled similarity metric named
distribution-aware similarity (DA similarity), which can guide the neighbor
sampling process and evaluate the quality of the input graph explicitly. We
also prove that DA similarity has a positive correlation with the final
performance, through both theoretical analysis and empirical simulations.
Second, we propose a simplified GCN architecture which employs a single GCN
layer to aggregate information from the neighbors filtered by DA similarity and
then generates the node representations. Moreover, the aggregation step is a
parameter-free operation, such that it can be done in a pre-processing manner
to further reduce red the training and inference costs. Third, we conduct
extensive experiments on four datasets. The results verify that the proposed
model outperforms existing GCN models considerably and yields up to a few
orders of magnitude speedup in training, in terms of the recommendation
performance.

complexity $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ for ferromagnetic RBMs (i.e., with attractive

answering queries mediated by description logic ontologies and constructing
their optimal rewritings to standard database queries. Originated in
ontology-based data access and datalog optimisation, this problem is known to
be computationally very complex in general, with no explicit syntactic
characterisations available. In this article, aiming to understand the
fundamental roots of this difficulty, we strip the problem to the bare bones
and focus on Boolean conjunctive queries mediated by a simple covering axiom
stating that one class is covered by the union of two other classes. We show
that, on the one hand, these rudimentary ontology-mediated queries, called
disjunctive sirups (or d-sirups), capture many features and difficulties of the
general case. For example, answering d-sirups is Pi^p_2-complete for combined
complexity and can be in AC0 or LogSpace-, NL-, P-, or coNP-complete for data
complexity (with the problem of recognising FO-rewritability of d-sirups being
2ExpTime-hard); some d-sirups only have exponential-size resolution proofs,
some only double-exponential-size positive existential FO-rewritings and
single-exponential-size nonrecursive datalog rewritings. On the other hand, we
prove a few partial sufficient and necessary conditions of FO- and
(symmetric/linear-) datalog rewritability of d-sirups. Our main technical
result is a complete and transparent syntactic AC0/NL/P/coNP tetrachotomy of
d-sirups with disjoint covering classes and a path-shaped Boolean conjunctive
query. To obtain this tetrachotomy, we develop new techniques for establishing
P- and coNP-hardness of answering non-Horn ontology-mediated queries as well as
showing that they can be answered in NL.

from the ALMA main array, ALMA Compact Array (ACA), the Nobeyama 45m Telescope,
and the JVLA (providing temperature measurement on matching scales), we find
that most of the dense gas in OMC-2/3 is subsonic ($\rm \sigma_{NT}/c_{s}$ =
0.62) with a mean line width ($\Delta\upsilon$) of 0.39 km s$^{-1}$ FWHM. This
is markedly different from the majority of previous observations of massive
star-forming regions. In contrast, line widths from the Nobeyama Telescope are
transonic at 0.69 km s$^{-1}$ ($\rm \sigma_{NT}/c_{s}$ = 1.08). We demonstrated
that the larger line widths obtained by the single-dish telescope arose from
unresolved sub-structures within their respective beams. The dispersions from
larger scales $\sigma_{ls}$ (as traced by the Nobeyama Telescope) can be
decomposed into three components $\rm \sigma_{ls}^2 = \sigma_{ss}^2+
\sigma_{bm}^2+ \sigma_{rd}^2$, where small-scale $\sigma_{ss}$ is the line
dispersion of each ALMA beam, bulk motion $\sigma_{bm}$ is dispersion between
peak velocity of each ALMA beam, and $\sigma_{rd}$ is the residual dispersion.
Such decomposition, though purely empirical, appears to be robust throughout
our data cubes. Apparent supersonic line widths, commonly found in massive
molecular clouds, are thus likely due to the effect of poor spatial resolution.
The observed non-thermal line dispersion (sometimes referred to as
'turbulence') transits from supersonic to subsonic at $\sim 0.05$ pc scales in
OMC-2/3 region. Such transition could be commonly found with sufficient spatial
(not just angular) resolution, even in regions with massive young clusters,
such as Orion molecular clouds studied here.

present a neural architecture for building deep active inference agents
operating in complex, continuous state-spaces using multiple forms of
Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. For this, we introduce a number of techniques, novel
to active inference. These include: i) selecting free-energy-optimal policies
via MC tree search, ii) approximating this optimal policy distribution via a
feed-forward `habitual' network, iii) predicting future parameter belief
updates using MC dropouts and, finally, iv) optimizing state transition
precision (a high-end form of attention). Our approach enables agents to learn
environmental dynamics efficiently, while maintaining task performance, in
relation to reward-based counterparts. We illustrate this in a new toy
environment, based on the dSprites data-set, and demonstrate that active
inference agents automatically create disentangled representations that are apt
for modeling state transitions. In a more complex Animal-AI environment, our
agents (using the same neural architecture) are able to simulate future state

  Dimensional Eulerian Dynamics",,,,,"physics.comp-ph cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  In the field of fluid numerical analysis, there has been a long-standing
problem: lacking of a rigorous mathematical tool to map from a continuous flow
field to discrete vortex particles, hurdling the Lagrangian particles from
inheriting the high resolution of a large-scale Eulerian solver. To tackle this
challenge, we propose a novel learning-based framework, the Neural Vortex
Method (NVM), which builds a neural-network description of the Lagrangian
vortex structures and their interaction dynamics to reconstruct the
high-resolution Eulerian flow field in a physically-precise manner. The key
components of our infrastructure consist of two networks: a vortex
representation network to identify the Lagrangian vortices from a grid-based
velocity field and a vortex interaction network to learn the underlying
governing dynamics of these finite structures. By embedding these two networks
with a vorticity-to-velocity Poisson solver and training its parameters using
the high-fidelity data obtained from high-resolution direct numerical
simulation, we can predict the accurate fluid dynamics on a precision level
that was infeasible for all the previous conventional vortex methods (CVMs). To
the best of our knowledge, our method is the first approach that can utilize
motions of finite particles to learn infinite dimensional dynamic systems. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our method in generating highly accurate prediction
results, with low computational cost, of the leapfrogging vortex rings system,
the turbulence system, and the systems governed by Euler equations with
different external forces.

of the hyperbolic conservation laws (HCLs) based on short-term discontinuous

approximate Riemann solver (P. L. Roe, J. Comput. Phys., vol. 43, 1981, pp.
357--372), which is one of the most fundamental HCLs numerical solvers. In
order to accurately solve the HCLs, Roe argues the need to construct a Roe
matrix that fulfills ""Property U"", including diagonalizable with real
eigenvalues, consistent with the exact Jacobian, and preserving conserved
quantities. However, the construction of such matrix cannot be achieved by any
general numerical method. Our model made a breakthrough improvement in solving
the HCLs by applying Roe solver under a neural network perspective. To enhance
the expressiveness of our model, we incorporate pseudoinverses into a novel
context to enable a hidden dimension so that we are flexible with the number of
parameters. The ability of our model to predict long-term discontinuity from a
short window of continuous training data is in general considered impossible
using traditional machine learning approaches. We demonstrate that our model
can generate highly accurate predictions of evolution of convection without
dissipation and the discontinuity of hyperbolic systems from smooth training

of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), involve many distinct molecular
processes. The difference in their molecular processes is studied by using the
different genes involved in each disease, and it is explored further for drug
targeting and drug repurposing. Methods: The initial set of genes was obtained
by mining published literature and several curated databases. The identified
genes were then subject to Systems and Network analysis to reveal their
molecular processes and shed some light on their pathogenesis. Such
methodologies have identified newer targets and drugs that can be repurposed.
Results: We use a Systems and Network Medicine approach to understand the
mechanism of actions of genes involved in IBD. From an initial set of genes
mined from literature and curated databases, we used the Multi-Steiner Tree
algorithm implemented within the CoVex systems medicine platform to expand each
disease module by incorporating candidate genes with significant connections to
the disease-related seed genes. Such expanded disease modules will identify a
larger set of potential targets and drugs. We used the Closeness Centrality
algorithm implemented within CoVex to search for newer targets and repurposable
drugs. Through a network medicine approach, we provide a mechanistic view of
the diseases and point to newer drugs and targets. Conclusion: We demonstrate
that the Systems and Network Medicine approach is a powerful way to understand
diseases and understand their mechanisms of action.

machine learning architectures through end-to-end differentiation. However,
backprop is often criticised for lacking biological plausibility. Recently, it
has been shown that backprop in multilayer-perceptrons (MLPs) can be
approximated using predictive coding, a biologically-plausible process theory
of cortical computation which relies only on local and Hebbian updates. The
power of backprop, however, lies not in its instantiation in MLPs, but rather
in the concept of automatic differentiation which allows for the optimisation
of any differentiable program expressed as a computation graph. Here, we
demonstrate that predictive coding converges asymptotically (and in practice
rapidly) to exact backprop gradients on arbitrary computation graphs using only
local learning rules. We apply this result to develop a straightforward
strategy to translate core machine learning architectures into their predictive
coding equivalents. We construct predictive coding CNNs, RNNs, and the more
complex LSTMs, which include a non-layer-like branching internal graph
structure and multiplicative interactions. Our models perform equivalently to
backprop on challenging machine learning benchmarks, while utilising only local
and (mostly) Hebbian plasticity. Our method raises the potential that standard
machine learning algorithms could in principle be directly implemented in
neural circuitry, and may also contribute to the development of completely
distributed neuromorphic architectures.

used research-based instructional strategy in physics courses partly because it
has a relatively low barrier to implementation. Moreover, validated robust
sequences of clicker questions are likely to provide better scaffolding support
and guidance to help students build a good knowledge structure of physics than
an individual clicker question on a particular topic. Here we discuss the
development, validation and in-class implementation of a clicker question
sequence (CQS) for helping advanced undergraduate students learn about Larmor
precession of spin, which takes advantage of the learning goals and
inquiry-based guided learning sequences in a previously validated Quantum

peer instruction is discussed by comparing upper-level undergraduate student
performance after traditional lecture-based instruction and after engaging with
the CQS.

flow quantities such as the size and anisotropy of the dissipative scales, as
well as the transition between 2D and 3D state. To this end, we calculate an
upper bound for the attractor dimension of the motion equations, which
indicates the number of modes present in the fully developed flow. This method
has already been used successfully to derive such estimates for 2D and 3D
hydrodynamic turbulence as a function of the $\mathcal L_\infty$ norm of the
dissipation, as in \cite{doering95}. We tackle here the problem of a flow
periodic in the 3 spatial directions (spatial period $2\pi L$), to which a
permanent magnetic field is applied. In addition, the detailed study of the
dissipation operator provides more indications about the structure of the flow.
In section 2, we review the tools of the dynamical system theory as well as the
results they have led to in the case of 3D hydrodynamic turbulence. Section 3
is devoted to the study of the set of modes which minimises the trace of the
operator associated to the total dissipation in MHD turbulence (viscous and
Joule). Eventually, the estimates for the attractor dimension and dissipative
scales in MHD turbulence under strong magnetic field are derived in section 4
and compared to results obtained from heuristic considerations.

for each module of the SAN that emulates dynamic behavior of a Processing

early estimation of performance parameters viz. memory bandwidth, average queue
length at memory and average waiting time seen by a processing element; while
we provide parameters viz. number of processing elements, the mean computation
time of processing elements and the first and second moments of connection time
between processing elements and memories, as input to the model.

mining. Accurate Ride-hailing demand prediction can help to pre-allocate
resources, improve vehicle utilization and user experiences. Graph
Convolutional Networks (GCN) is commonly used to model the complicated
irregular non-Euclidean spatial correlations. However, existing GCN-based
ride-hailing demand prediction methods only assign the same importance to
different neighbor regions, and maintain a fixed graph structure with static
spatial relationships throughout the timeline when extracting the irregular
non-Euclidean spatial correlations. In this paper, we propose the
Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Graph Attention Network (STDGAT), a novel ride-hailing
demand prediction method. Based on the attention mechanism of GAT, STDGAT
extracts different pair-wise correlations to achieve the adaptive importance
allocation for different neighbor regions. Moreover, in STDGAT, we design a
novel time-specific commuting-based graph attention mode to construct a dynamic
graph structure for capturing the dynamic time-specific spatial relationships
throughout the timeline. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world
ride-hailing demand dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the
significant improvement of our method on three evaluation metrics RMSE, MAPE
and MAE over state-of-the-art baselines.

reliability of dependable systems. Traditionally, those systems were small and
self-contained, and the main challenge for model-based evaluation has been the
efficiency of the solution process. Recently, the problem of specifying and
maintaining complex models has increasingly gained attention, as modern systems
are characterized by many components and complex interactions. Components share
similarities, but also exhibit variations in their behavior due to different
configurations or roles in the system. From the modeling perspective,
variations lead to replicating and altering a small set of base models multiple
times. Variability is taken into account only informally, by defining a sample
model and explaining its possible variations. In this paper we address the
problem of including variability in performability models, focusing on
Stochastic Activity Networks (SANs). We introduce the formal definition of
Stochastic Activity Networks Templates (SAN-T), a formalism based on SANs with
the addition of variability aspects. Differently from other approaches,
parameters can also affect the structure of the model, like the number of cases
of activities. We apply the SAN-T formalism to the modeling of the backbone
network of an environmental monitoring infrastructure. In particular, we show
how existing SAN models from the literature can be generalized using the newly
introduced formalism.

has been not much work on finite-sample analysis for convergent off-policy

stochastic gradient algorithms w.r.t.~a primal-dual saddle-point objective
function, and then conduct a saddle-point error analysis to obtain
finite-sample bounds on their performance. Two revised algorithms are also
proposed, namely projected GTD2 and GTD2-MP, which offer improved convergence
guarantees and acceleration, respectively. The results of our theoretical
