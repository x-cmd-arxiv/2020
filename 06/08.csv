significantly reduces the need for a large number of digitizer channels, which
reduces the cost and the power consumption of a data acquisition system. We
previously demonstrated frequency domain multiplexing by convolution using a
prototype system that multiplexed two EJ-309 organic scintillators signals into
a single channel. Each detector pulse was converted to a damped sinusoid which
was then combined into a single channel. The combined signal was digitized and
the original detector signal was recovered from the damped sinusoid by
deconvolution. In this paper, we demonstrate the recovery of multiple detector
signals that arrive during the same digitized record via a new sequential
deconvolution method. When two detectors produce signals in the same digitized
record and their pulses do not overlap in time, we found that the charge,
arrival time, and particle type can be estimated fairly precisely for the first
pulse, but the second pulse exhibits substantial degradation in the precision
of the estimated charge and arrival time. When the pulses overlap in time, we
demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the part of the first
pulse that does not overlap with the second can be recovered accurately, so the
arrival time and amplitude of the first pulse can be estimated fairly
precisely, but not the charge or particle type. None of these quantities can be
estimated precisely for the second pulse when the two pulses overlap.

tend to correspond to degenerate stability conditions vanishing on spherical
objects. Describing such missing strata is also interesting from a
mirror-symmetric perspective, as they conjecturally parametrize interesting

constructing modular partial compactifications show how elusive and subtle the
problem in fact is: ideally, the missing strata would correspond to stability
manifolds of quotient triangulated categories, but establishing such
correspondence on geometric level and viewing stability conditions on quotients
of the original triangulated category as suitable degenerations of stability
conditions is not straightforward. In this paper, we will present a method to
construct such partial compactifications if some additional hypoteses are

Traditionally, these samples are drawn from probabilistic ( or deterministic )

narrow passages (bottleneck regions). Current state of the art techniques train
a learning model (learner) to predict samples selectively on these bottleneck

differences are skewed towards the nearest zeta zero, or at least, in the case
of very nearby zeros, the skewness always decreases when zeta zero is crossed

local maximum or, at least, a turning point at every zeta zero, i.e., local
minimum of the second derivative of the variance. In addition, it seems that
the higher the zeros the more compactly the distributions of the differences

hand-crafted features, slicing the input data in a smaller time-windows, and
recurrent convolution. However, these approaches partially solve the problem,
but simultaneously hinder the CNN's capability to learn from unknown

a novel time encoding kernel (EnK) approach, which introduces the increasing

by EnK lets CNN learn time-dependent features in-addition to local and global
features. We performed extensive experiments on several EEG datasets: cognitive

state-of-art by 12\% (F1 score). Moreover, the EnK approach required only one

previous works rarely consider the uncertainty when humans provide feedback,
especially in cases that the optimal actions are not obvious to the trainers.
For example, the reward of a sub-optimal action can be stochastic and sometimes
exceeds that of the optimal action, which is common in games or real-world.
Trainers are likely to provide positive feedback to sub-optimal actions,
negative feedback to the optimal actions and even do not provide feedback in
some confusing situations. Existing works, which utilize the Expectation
Maximization (EM) algorithm and treat the feedback model as hidden parameters,
do not consider uncertainties in the learning environment and human feedback.
To address this challenge, we introduce a novel feedback model that considers
the uncertainty of human feedback. However, this incurs intractable calculus in
the EM algorithm. To this end, we propose a novel approximate EM algorithm, in
which we approximate the expectation step with the Gradient Descent method.
Experimental results in both synthetic scenarios and two real-world scenarios

systems has shed light on the success of relativistic hydrodynamics in
describing heavy-ion collisions at zero chemical potential. As the search for
the QCD critical point continues, it is important to investigate how out of
equilibrium effects influence the trajectories on the QCD phase diagram. In
this proceedings, we study a Bjorken expanding hydrodynamic system based on
DMNR equations of motion with initial out of equilibrium effects and finite
chemical potential in a system with a critical point. We find that the initial
conditions are not unique for a specific freeze-out point, but rather the
system can evolve to the same final state freeze-out point with a wide range of
initial baryon chemical potential, $\mu_B$. For the same initial energy density
and baryon density, depending on how far out of equilibrium the system begins,
the initial $\mu_B$ can vary by $\Delta \mu_B\sim 350$ MeV. Our results
indicate that knowledge of the out-of-equilibrium effects in the initial state
provide vital information that influences the search for the QCD critical
point.

  As an application, we study the metastable behavior of critical zero-range
processes. Let $r: S\times S\to \bb R_+$ be the jump rates of an irreducible
random walk on a finite set $S$, reversible with respect to the uniform
measure. For $\alpha >0$, let $g: \bb N\to \bb R_+$ be given by $g(0)=0$,
$g(1)=1$, $g(k) = [k/(k-1)]^\alpha$, $k\ge 2$. Consider a zero-range process on
$S$ in which a particle jumps from a site $x$, occupied by $k$ particles, to a
site $y$ at rate $g(k) r(x,y)$. For $\alpha \ge 1$, in the stationary state, as
the total number of particles, represented by $N$, tends to infinity, all
particles but a negligible number accumulate at one single site. This
phenomenon is called condensation. Since condensation occurs if and only if
$\alpha\ge 1$, we call the case $\alpha =1$ critical. By applying the general
method established in the first part of the article to the critical case, we
show that the site which concentrates almost all particles evolves in the
time-scale $N^2 \log N$ as a random walk on $S$ whose transition rates are
proportional to the capacities of the underlying random walk.

HE-based linear layers of a HPPNN cost $93\%$ inference latency, it is critical

agreement indices are necessary before their participation. While the
intuitively appealing agreement indices such as coverage probability and total
deviation index, and relative area under coverage probability curve, have been
extended for assessing overall agreement among multiple raters, these
extensions have limitations. The existing overall agreement indices either
require normality and homogeneity assumptions or did not preserve the intuitive

we propose a new set of overall agreement indices based on maximum pairwise
differences among all raters. The proposed new overall coverage probability,
overall total deviation index and relative area under overall coverage

a new unified nonparametric estimation and inference approach for the overall

replications made by the same rater. Under mild assumptions, the proposed
variance estimator is shown to achieve efficiency bound under independent

conducted to assess the performance of the proposed estimation and inference

been a surge of interest in using machine learning models to discover governing

lack uncertainty quantification to communicate their credibility. This work
addresses this shortcoming from a Bayesian perspective. We introduce a novel
model comprising ""leaf"" modules that learn to represent distinct experiments'
spatiotemporal functional data as neural networks and a single ""root"" module
that expresses a nonparametric distribution over their governing nonlinear
differential operator as a Gaussian process. Automatic differentiation is used
to compute the required partial derivatives from the leaf functions as inputs
to the root. Our approach quantifies the reliability of the learned physics in
terms of a posterior distribution over operators and propagates this
uncertainty to solutions of novel initial-boundary value problem instances.
Numerical experiments demonstrate the method on several nonlinear PDEs.

absence of subjective breathlessness. This immediate clinical driver, combined
with the general quest for more personalised health data, means that pulse
oximetry measurement of capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) will likely expand
into both the clinical and consumer market of wearable health technology in the
near future. In this study, we set out to establish the feasibility of SpO2
measurement from the ear canal as a convenient site for long term monitoring,
and perform a comprehensive comparison with the right index finger - the
conventional clinical measurement site. During resting SpO2 estimation, we
found a root mean square difference of 1.47% between the two measurement sites,
with a mean difference of 0.23% higher SpO2 in the right ear canal. Through the
simultaneous recording of pulse oximetry from both the right ear canal and
index finger during breath holds, we observe a substantial improvement in
response time between the ear and finger that has a mean of 12.4 seconds and a
range of 4.2 - 24.2 seconds across all subjects. Factors which influence this
response time, termed SpO2 delay, such as the sex of a subject are also
explored. Furthermore, we examine the potential downsides of ear canal blood
oxygen saturation measurement, namely the lower photoplethysmogram amplitude,
and suggest ways to mitigate this disadvantage. These results are presented in
conjunction with previously discovered benefits such as robustness to

providing effective structural priors for compressed sensing, since they can be
trained to span low-dimensional data manifolds in high-dimensional signal
spaces. Despite the non-convexity of the resulting optimization problem, it has
also been shown theoretically that, for neural networks with random Gaussian
weights, a signal in the range of the network can be efficiently, approximately
recovered from a few noisy measurements. However, a major bottleneck of these
theoretical guarantees is a network expansivity condition: that each layer of
the neural network must be larger than the previous by a logarithmic factor.
Our main contribution is to break this strong expansivity assumption, showing
that constant expansivity suffices to get efficient recovery algorithms,
besides it also being information-theoretically necessary. To overcome the
theoretical bottleneck in existing approaches we prove a novel uniform
concentration theorem for random functions that might not be Lipschitz but
satisfy a relaxed notion which we call ""pseudo-Lipschitzness."" Using this
theorem we can show that a matrix concentration inequality known as the Weight
Distribution Condition (WDC), which was previously only known to hold for
Gaussian matrices with logarithmic aspect ratio, in fact holds for constant
aspect ratios too. Since the WDC is a fundamental matrix concentration
inequality in the heart of all existing theoretical guarantees on this problem,
our tighter bound immediately yields improvements in all known results in the
literature on compressed sensing with deep generative priors, including one-bit
recovery, phase retrieval, low-rank matrix recovery, and more.

require a deeper and, importantly, a collective understanding of the product
domain to serve as a rich context within which to understand the product
requirements. Little is known about the factors that support or impede these
teams in collectively achieving this deep understanding of the product domain.
Using Constructivist Grounded Theory method, we study individuals and teams
across seven software companies that create products for a diverse range of
markets. The study found that certain organisational and planning process
factors play a significant role in whether product development teams have the
potential to collectively develop deep domain understanding. These factors also
impact individual and development team dynamics. We identify two essential
metaphorical dynamics of broadening the lens and blurring boundaries that
cross-functional product teams employ in order to fully embrace product
ownership, visioning, and planning towards achieving a deep collective domain
understanding, creating a richer context in which to understand product
requirements. We also conclude that the highly specialised nature of many
organisational models and development processes is contraindicated for
cross-functional product development teams in achieving this deep collective
understanding and we call for a rethinking of conventional organisational and
product planning practices for software product development.

nodes in a graph as distributed vectors. However, the majority of network
embedding methods focus on learning a single vector representation for each
node, which has been recently criticized for not being capable of modeling
multiple aspects of a node. To capture the multiple aspects of each node,
existing studies mainly rely on offline graph clustering performed prior to the
actual embedding, which results in the cluster membership of each node (i.e.,
node aspect distribution) fixed throughout training of the embedding model. We
argue that this not only makes each node always have the same aspect
distribution regardless of its dynamic context, but also hinders the end-to-end
training of the model that eventually leads to the final embedding quality
largely dependent on the clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel
end-to-end framework for multi-aspect network embedding, called asp2vec, in
which the aspects of each node are dynamically assigned based on its local
context. More precisely, among multiple aspects, we dynamically assign a single
aspect to each node based on its current context, and our aspect selection
module is end-to-end differentiable via the Gumbel-Softmax trick. We also
introduce the aspect regularization framework to capture the interactions among
the multiple aspects in terms of relatedness and diversity. We further
demonstrate that our proposed framework can be readily extended to
heterogeneous networks. Extensive experiments towards various downstream tasks
on various types of homogeneous networks and a heterogeneous network
demonstrate the superiority of asp2vec.

sequence. This resolves a conjecture of Vasconcelos. We prove a similar result
for the first Koszul homology module of $I$. When $R$ is a localisation of a
polynomial ring over a field $K$ of characteristic zero, Vasconcelos
conjectured that $R/I$ is a reduced complete intersection if the module
$\Omega_{(R/I)/K}$ of differentials has finite projective dimension; we prove
this contingent on the Eisenbud-Mazur conjecture.
  The arguments exploit the structure of the homotopy Lie algebra associated to
$I$ in an essential way. By work of Avramov and Halperin, if every degree $2$
element of the homotopy Lie algebra is radical, then $I$ is generated by a
regular sequence. Iyengar has shown that free summands of $I/I^2$ give rise to
central elements of the homotopy Lie algebra, and we establish an analogous
criterion for constructing radical elements, from which we deduce our main
result.

recurrent network jet eruptions clearly drive the counter-streaming flows along

to stem from sites of flux cancelation, between network flux and merging
opposite-polarity flux, and (vi) some show brightening at their bases,
analogous to the base brightening in coronal jets. The average speed of the
counter-streaming flows along the filament/filament channel threads is 70 km/s.
The average widths of the AIA filament/filament channel and the Halpha filament

triggered by magnetic flux cancelation.

with high energies and antisunward drifts along the magnetic field. Their
evolution may offer plausible explanations for the rapid decrease of the heat
flux with the solar wind expansion, typically invoked being the self-generated
instabilities, or the so-called heat flux instabilities (HFIs). The present
paper provides a unified description of the full spectrum of HFIs, as
prescribed by the linear kinetic theory for high beta conditions ($\beta_e \gg
0.1$) and different relative drifts ($U$) of the suprathermals. HFIs of
different nature are distinguished, i.e., electromagnetic, electrostatic or
hybrid, propagating parallel or obliquely to the magnetic field, etc., as well
as their regimes of interplay (co-existence) or dominance. These alternative
regimes of HFIs complement each other and may be characteristic to different
relative drifts of suprathermal electrons and various conditions in the solar
wind, e.g., in the slow or fast winds, streaming interaction regions and
interplanetary shocks. Moreover, these results strongly suggest that heat flux
regulation may not involve only one but several HFIs, concomitantly or
successively in time. Conditions for a single, well defined instability with
major effects on the suprathermal electrons and, implicitly, the heat flux,
seem to be very limited. Whistler HFIs are more likely to occur but only for
minor drifts (as also reported by recent observations), which may explain a

the defect turns into zero-energy modes when the gain-loss contrast exceeds a
threshold, at which the defect states encounter an exceptional point. Our
approach can be used to obtain robust lasing or perfectly absorbing modes in
any part of the system.

can see these permutations as describing locations of $n$ kings on a chessboard

exactly one king and) no two kings are attacking each other, with the
additional condition that a king can move off a certain row and reappear at the

  In a recent paper, we dealt with the more general set of 'king permutations'

  In this article we investigate the sub-poset of the cylindrical king

of Manhattan distance of the plot of a permutation and some of its applications

a larger deep neural network and training different sub-networks on different
subsets of the data. Inspired by the dropout concept, we propose EDropout as an
energy-based framework for pruning neural networks in classification tasks. In
this approach, a set of binary pruning state vectors (population) represents a
set of corresponding sub-networks from an arbitrary provided original neural
network. An energy loss function assigns a scalar energy loss value to each
pruning state. The energy-based model stochastically evolves the population to
find states with lower energy loss. The best pruning state is then selected and
applied to the original network. Similar to dropout, the kept weights are
updated using backpropagation in a probabilistic model. The energy-based model
again searches for better pruning states and the cycle continuous. Indeed, this
procedure is in fact switching between the energy model, which manages the
pruning states, and the probabilistic model, which updates the temporarily
unpruned weights, in each iteration. The population can dynamically converge to
a pruning state. This can be interpreted as dropout leading to pruning the
network. From an implementation perspective, EDropout can prune typical neural
networks without modification of the network architecture. We evaluated the
proposed method on different flavours of ResNets, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet on
the Kuzushiji, Fashion, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Flowers datasets, and compared
the pruning rate and classification performance of the models. On average the
networks trained with EDropout achieved a pruning rate of more than $50\%$ of
the trainable parameters with approximately $<5\%$ and $<1\%$ drop of Top-1 and
Top-5 classification accuracy, respectively.

cosmological constant and cold dark matter (BD-$\Lambda$CDM for short). We
extend the scenarios where the current cosmological value of the BD-field is
restricted by the local astrophysical domain to scenarios where that value is
fixed only by the cosmological observations, which should be more natural in
view of the possible existence of local screening mechanims. Our analysis
includes both the background and perturbations equations in different gauges.
We find that the BD-$\Lambda$CDM is favored by the overall cosmological data as
compared to the concordance GR-$\Lambda$CDM model, namely data on distant
supernovae, cosmic chronometers, local measurements of the Hubble parameter,
baryonic acoustic oscillations, Large-Scale Structure formation and the cosmic
microwave background under full Planck 2018 CMB likelihood. We also test the
impact of Strong and Weak-Lensing data on our results, which can be
significant. We find that the BD-$\Lambda$CDM can mimic effective quintessence
with a significance of about $3-3.5\sigma$ c.l. (depending on the lensing
datasets). The fact that the BD-$\Lambda$CDM behaves effectively as a Running
Vacuum Model (RVM) when viewed from the GR perspective helps to alleviate some
of the existing tensions with the data, such as the $\sigma_8$ excess predicted
by GR-$\Lambda$CDM. On the other hand, the BD-$\Lambda$CDM model has a crucial
bearing on the acute $H_0$-tension with the local measurements, which is
rendered virtually harmless owing to the small increase of the effective value
of the gravitational constant with the expansion. The simultaneous alleviation
of the two tensions is a most remarkable feature of BD-gravity with a
cosmological constant in the light of the current observations, and hence goes
in support of BD-$\Lambda$CDM against GR-$\Lambda$CDM

the equality of recommended learning opportunities among learners. Then, we
envision a scenario wherein an educational platform should be arranged in such

securely-detected, dusty galaxies in the deep ALMA 1.2-mm image obtained as
part of the ALMA Spectroscopic Survey in the {\it Hubble} Ultra Deep Field
(ASPECS) Large Program. This sample is complemented by 26 additional sources
identified via an optical/infrared source positional prior. Using their
well-characterized spectral energy distributions, we derive median stellar
masses and star formation rates (SFR) of $4.8\times10^{10}~M_\odot$ and 30
$M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, and interquartile ranges of
$(2.4-11.7)\times10^{10}~M_\odot$ and $20-50~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, respectively.
We derive a median spectroscopic redshift of 1.8 with an interquartile range
$1.1-2.6$, significantly lower than submillimeter galaxies detected in
shallower, wide-field surveys. We find that 59\%$\pm$13\%, 6\%$\pm$4\%, and
34\%$\pm$9\% of our sources are within, above and below $\pm0.4$ dex from the
SFR-stellar mass relation or main-sequence (MS), respectively. The ASPECS
galaxies closely follow the SFR-molecular gas mass relation and other
previously established scaling relations, confirming a factor of five increase
of the gas-to-stellar mass ratio from $z=0.5$ to $z=2.5$ and a mild evolution
of the gas depletion timescales with a typical value of 0.7 Gyr at $z=1-3$.
ASPECS galaxies located significantly below the MS, a poorly exploited
parameter space, have low gas-to-stellar-mass ratios of $\sim0.1-0.2$ and long
depletion timescales $>1$ Gyr. Galaxies along the MS dominate the cosmic
density of molecular gas at all redshifts. Systems above the main sequence have
an increasing contribution to the total gas reservoirs from $z<1$ to $z=2.5$,
while the opposite is found for galaxies below the MS.

proof of the existence of a polynomial relation $f$ among the areas of the
triangles in a dissection of the unit square. More recently, the authors
studied a different polynomial $p$, also a relation among the areas of the
triangles in such a dissection, that is invariant under certain deformations of
the dissection. In this paper we study the relationship between these two
polynomials.
  We first generalize the notion of dissection, allowing triangles whose
orientation differs from that of the plane. We define a deformation space of
these generalized dissections and we show that this space is an irreducible
algebraic variety. We then extend the theorem of Monsky to the context of
generalized dissections, showing that Monsky's polynomial $f$ can be chosen to
be invariant under deformation. Although $f$ is not uniquely defined, the
interplay between $p$ and $f$ then allows us to identify a canonical pair of
choices for the polynomial $f$. In many cases, all of the coefficients of the
canonical $f$ polynomials are positive. We also use the deformation-invariance
of $f$ to prove that the polynomial $p$ is congruent modulo 2 to a power of the
sum of its variables.

wave, which is a signature component of the CD model, is generated with an
initial disturbance. In the 1D gas model, the rarefaction wave propagates
tailward at sound velocity and is assumed to cause thinning. Extending to a 2D
gas model of a simplified plasma sheet configuration, the rarefaction wave is
weakened, and the thinning ceases to propagate. Extending further to a 2D
plasma model by adding magnetic field into the lobes, the rarefaction wave is
quickly lost in the plasma sheet recompression, but the plasma sheet thinning
is still present and propagates independently at a slower velocity than a 1D

dominated by sheet-lobe interactions that are absent from the 1D model and may
not support the behaviour assumed by the CD model.

  Posterior Symmetries",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Bayesian low-rank matrix factorization techniques have become an essential
tool for relational data analysis and matrix completion. A standard approach is
to assign zero-mean Gaussian priors on the columns or rows of factor matrices
to create a conjugate system. This choice of prior leads to simple
implementations; however it also causes symmetries in the posterior
distribution that can severely reduce the efficiency of Markov-chain
Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling approaches. In this paper, we propose a simple
modification to the prior choice that provably breaks these symmetries and
maintains/improves accuracy. Specifically, we provide conditions that the
Gaussian prior mean and covariance must satisfy so the posterior does not
exhibit invariances that yield sampling difficulties. For example, we show that
using non-zero linearly independent prior means significantly lowers the
autocorrelation of MCMC samples, and can also lead to lower reconstruction
errors.

coarse-graining in physical space without Fourier transforms, allowing scale
analysis along vertical direction. Two processes are responsible for kinetic
energy flux across scales: baropycnal work $\Lambda$, due to large-scale
pressure gradients acting on small-scales of density and velocity, and
deformation work $\Pi$, due to multi-scale velocity. Our coarse-graining
analysis shows how these fluxes exhibit self-similar evolution that is
quadratic-in-time, similar to RT mixing layer. We find that $\Lambda$ is a
conduit for potential energy, transferring energy non-locally from the largest
scales to smaller scales in the inertial range where $\Pi$ takes over. In 3D,
$\Pi$ continues a persistent cascade to smaller scales, whereas in 2D $\Pi$
re-channels the energy back to larger scales despite the lack of vorticity
conservation in 2D variable density flows. This gives rise to a positive
feedback loop in 2D-RT (absent in 3D) in which mixing layer growth and the
associated potential energy release are enhanced relative to 3D, explaining the
oft-observed larger $\alpha$ values in 2D simulations. Despite higher bulk
kinetic energy levels in 2D, small inertial scales are weaker than in 3D.
Moreover, the net upscale cascade in 2D tends to isotropize the large-scale
flow, in stark contrast to 3D. Our findings indicate the absence of net upscale
energy transfer in 3D-RT as is often claimed; growth of large-scale bubbles and
spikes is not due to ""mergers"" but solely due to baropycnal work $\Lambda$.

few. They face common challenging problems that are factors in how text is
represented and affected by several environmental conditions. The current
state-of-the-art scene text detection and/or recognition methods have exploited
the witnessed advancement in deep learning architectures and reported a
superior accuracy on benchmark datasets when tackling multi-resolution and
multi-oriented text. However, there are still several remaining challenges
affecting text in the wild images that cause existing methods to underperform
due to there models are not able to generalize to unseen data and the
insufficient labeled data. Thus, unlike previous surveys in this field, the
objectives of this survey are as follows: first, offering the reader not only a
review on the recent advancement in scene text detection and recognition, but
also presenting the results of conducting extensive experiments using a unified
evaluation framework that assesses pre-trained models of the selected methods
on challenging cases, and applies the same evaluation criteria on these
techniques. Second, identifying several existing challenges for detecting or
recognizing text in the wild images, namely, in-plane-rotation, multi-oriented
and multi-resolution text, perspective distortion, illumination reflection,
partial occlusion, complex fonts, and special characters. Finally, the paper
also presents insight into the potential research directions in this field to
address some of the mentioned challenges that are still encountering scene text
detection and recognition techniques.

  optimization",,,,,"cs.CE cs.NA math.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The traditional element-based topology optimization based on material
penalization typically aims at a 0/1 design. Our numerical experiments reveal
that the compliance of a smooth design is overestimated when material
properties of boundary intermediate elements under the fixed-mesh finite
element analysis are interpolated with a material penalization model. This
paper proposes a floating projection topology optimization (FPTO) method for
seeking a smooth design using the ersatz material model or a 0/1 design using a
material penalization model. The proposed floating projection constraint
combining with the upper and lower bounds heuristically simulates 0/1
constraints of design variables in the original discrete optimization problem.
Numerical examples demonstrate the capability of the proposed element-based
topology optimization approach in obtaining 0/1 or smooth designs for 2D and 3D
compliance minimization problems. The proposed topology optimization approach
can be easily implemented under the framework of the fixed-mesh finite element
analysis and provides an alternative way to form explicit topologies of
structures, especially when the ersatz material model is adopted.

critical factors in learning deep models. Second, a systematic review to the

multi-agent assortment optimization problem in the two-sided sequential
matching model introduced by Ashlagi et al. (2020b). The setting is the
following: we (the platform) offer a menu of suppliers to each customer. Then,
every customer selects, simultaneously and independently, to match with a
supplier or to remain unmatched. Each supplier observes the subset of customers
that selected them, and chooses either to match a customer or to leave the
system. Therefore, a match takes place if both a customer and a supplier
sequentially select each other. Each agent's behavior is probabilistic and
determined by a discrete choice model. Our goal is to choose an assortment
family that maximizes the expected revenue of the matching. Given the
complexity of the problem, we show several constant factor approximation
guarantees for an heterogeneous setting where customers follow different
multinomial logit models and suppliers follow a general choice model whose
demand function is monotone and submodular. Furthermore, we obtain the first
constant approximation guarantees when the problem is subject to cardinality
constraints and the objective is the revenue of the matching. Our approach
relies on submodular optimization techniques and appropriate randomized
rounding methods. We also provide several extensions of our results, notably,
the problem becomes polynomially solvable when we allow suppliers to select an
unlimited number of customers as long as the corresponding subproblems are
polynomially solvable. We also discuss managerial implications of this model.
In particular, we show that for matching platforms it is better to allow the
agents whose opposite side is less attractive to initiate the matchmaking
process. Finally, we provide an extensive computational study that supports our
technical and managerial results.

proposed to address the preamble collision problem in GFRA. The key idea is to
identify and employ the neighboring access points (APs) of a collided RA UE for
its data decoding rather than all the APs, so that the mutual interference
among collided RA UEs can be effectively mitigated. To this end, we first
design a tailored deep neural network (DNN) to enable the preamble multiplicity
estimation in GFRA, where an energy detection (ED) method is also proposed for
performance comparison. With the estimated preamble multiplicity, we then
propose a K-means AP clustering algorithm to cluster the neighboring APs of
collided RA UEs and organize each AP cluster to decode the received data
individually. Simulation results show that a decent performance of preamble
multiplicity estimation in terms of accuracy and reliability can be achieved by
the proposed DNN, and confirm that the proposed schemes are effective in
preamble collision resolution in GFRA, which are able to achieve a near-optimal
performance in terms of uplink achievable rate per collided RA UE, and offer
significant performance improvement over traditional schemes.

tasks. Techniques have recently shifted to neural mesh autoencoders. Although
they demonstrate higher precision than traditional methods, they remain unable

applied to a template-specific surface mesh, and is not applicable to more
general meshes, like tetrahedrons and non-manifold meshes. While more general
graph convolution methods can be employed, they lack performance in
reconstruction precision and require higher memory usage. In this paper, we
propose a non-template-specific fully convolutional mesh autoencoder for
arbitrary registered mesh data. It is enabled by our novel convolution and
(un)pooling operators learned with globally shared weights and locally varying
coefficients which can efficiently capture the spatially varying contents
presented by irregular mesh connections. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art
methods on reconstruction accuracy. In addition, the latent codes of our
network are fully localized thanks to the fully convolutional structure, and
thus have much higher interpolation capability than many traditional 3D mesh

recent serendipitous discovery in the LMC of the first confirmed extragalactic
[WC11] star, whose spectrum is dominated by C II emission, and the realization
that the number of such objects is currently largely unconstrained. The survey,
which imaged $\sim$50$~$deg$^2$ using on-band and off-band filters, will
significantly increase the total census of these rare stars. In addition, each
new LMC [WC] star has a known luminosity, a quantity quite uncertain in the
Galactic sample. Multiple known C II emitters were easily recovered, validating
the survey design. We find 38 new C II emission candidates; spectroscopy of the
complete sample will be needed to ascertain their nature. In a preliminary
spectroscopic reconnaissance, we observed three candidates, finding C II
emission in each. One is a new [WC11]. Another shows both the narrow C II
emission lines characteristic of a [WC11], but also broad emission of C IV, O
V, and He II characteristic of a much hotter [WC4] star; we speculate that this
is a binary [WC]. The third object shows weak C II emission, but the spectrum
is dominated by a dense thicket of strong absorption lines, including numerous
O II transitions. We conclude it is likely an unusual hot, hydrogen-poor
post-AGB star, possibly in transition from [WC] to white dwarf. Even lacking a
complete spectroscopic program, we can infer that late [WC] stars do not
dominate the central stars of LMC planetary nebulae, and that the detected C II
emitters are largely of an old population.

popularity due to its manufacturing simplicity and unique mechanism. However,
these also cause significant challenges on software and algorithm design,
especially for the pose estimation (i.e., determining the robot's rotation and
position) of skid-steering robots, since they change their orientation with an
inevitable skid. To tackle this problem, we propose a probabilistic
sliding-window estimator dedicated to skid-steering robots, using measurements
from a monocular camera, the wheel encoders, and optionally an inertial
measurement unit (IMU). Specifically, we explicitly model the kinematics of
skid-steering robots by both track instantaneous centers of rotation (ICRs) and
correction factors, which are capable of compensating for the complexity of
track-to-terrain interaction, the imperfectness of mechanical design, terrain
conditions and smoothness, etc. To prevent performance reduction in robots'
long-term missions, the time- and location- varying kinematic parameters are
estimated online along with pose estimation states in a tightly-coupled manner.
More importantly, we conduct in-depth observability analysis for different
sensors and design configurations in this paper, which provides us with
theoretical tools in making the correct choice when building real commercial
robots. In our experiments, we validate the proposed method by both simulation
tests and real-world experiments, which demonstrate that our method outperforms
competing methods by wide margins.

the spectral index is consistent with latest Planck 2018 dataset while the
scalar to tensor ratio is a bit higher. We then proceeded to analyze the
behavior of an inflation driven by $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled with a real scalar

major role in driving inflationary scenarios.

convergence rate of gradient descent methods by orders of magnitude when
dealing with smooth convex objective, has led to tremendous success in training
machine learning tasks. In this article, the convergence of individual iterates
of projected subgradient (PSG) methods for nonsmooth convex optimization
problems is theoretically studied based on Nesterov's extrapolation, which we
name individual convergence. We prove that Nesterov's extrapolation has the
strength to make the individual convergence of PSG optimal for nonsmooth
problems. In light of this consideration, a direct modification of the
subgradient evaluation suffices to achieve optimal individual convergence for
strongly convex problems, which can be regarded as making an interesting step
toward the open question about stochastic gradient descent (SGD) posed by
Shamir. Furthermore, we give an extension of the derived algorithms to solve
regularized learning tasks with nonsmooth losses in stochastic settings.
Compared with other state-of-the-art nonsmooth methods, the derived algorithms
can serve as an alternative to the basic SGD especially in coping with machine
learning problems, where an individual output is needed to guarantee the
regularization structure while keeping an optimal rate of convergence.
Typically, our method is applicable as an efficient tool for solving
large-scale $l$1-regularized hinge-loss learning problems. Several comparison
experiments demonstrate that our individual output not only achieves an optimal
convergence rate but also guarantees better sparsity than the averaged
solution.

fragility of deep neural networks to small perturbations and has received an
abundance of attention in recent years. Distributionally Robust Optimization
(DRO), a particularly promising way of addressing this challenge, studies
robustness via divergence-based uncertainty sets and has provided valuable
insights into robustification strategies such as regularization. In the context
of machine learning, the majority of existing results have chosen
$f$-divergences, Wasserstein distances and more recently, the Maximum Mean
Discrepancy (MMD) to construct uncertainty sets. We extend this line of work
for the purposes of understanding robustness via regularization by studying
uncertainty sets constructed with Integral Probability Metrics (IPMs) - a large
family of divergences including the MMD, Total Variation and Wasserstein
distances. Our main result shows that DRO under \textit{any} choice of IPM
corresponds to a family of regularization penalties, which recover and improve
upon existing results in the setting of MMD and Wasserstein distances. Due to
the generality of our result, we show that other choices of IPMs correspond to
other commonly used penalties in machine learning. Furthermore, we extend our
results to shed light on adversarial generative modelling via $f$-GANs,
constituting the first study of distributional robustness for the $f$-GAN
objective. Our results unveil the inductive properties of the discriminator set
with regards to robustness, allowing us to give positive comments for several
penalty-based GAN methods such as Wasserstein-, MMD- and Sobolev-GANs. In
summary, our results intimately link GANs to distributional robustness, extend
previous results on DRO and contribute to our understanding of the link between

Sparse-Sampling-based Monte Carlo Oracle and argue that it satisfies the
stability property as long as the system dynamics under the optimal policy
respects a Lyapunov function. The assumption of existence of a Lyapunov
function is not restrictive as it is equivalent to the positive recurrence or
stability property of any Markov chain, i.e., if there is any policy that can
stabilize the system then it must possess a Lyapunov function. And, our policy
does not utilize the knowledge of the specific Lyapunov function. To make our

for signals in spectrograms of intensity as a function of time and frequency
(which can be thought of as images), but tend to do poorly in identifying
multiple signals in a single data frame. This is especially apparent when there
are dim signals in the same frame as bright, high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
signals. In this work, we approach this problem using convolutional neural
networks (CNN) as a computationally efficient method for localizing signals in
synthetic observations resembling data collected by Breakthrough Listen using
the Green Bank Telescope. We generate two synthetic datasets, the first with
exactly one signal at various SNR levels and the second with exactly two
signals, one of which represents RFI. We find that a residual CNN with strided
convolutions and using multiple image normalizations as input outperforms a
more basic CNN with max pooling trained on inputs with only one normalization.
Training each model on a smaller subset of the training data at higher SNR
levels results in a significant increase in model performance, reducing root

real states of the environment. We present the Hallucinated Value Hypothesis
(HVH): updating values of real states towards values of hallucinated states
results in misleading state-action values which adversely affect the control
policy. We discuss and evaluate four Dyna variants; three which update real
states toward simulated -- and therefore potentially hallucinated -- states and
one which does not. The experimental results provide evidence for the HVH thus
suggesting a fruitful direction toward developing Dyna algorithms robust to
model error.

technologically viable, heavy-metal-based thin film materials that could
generate spin currents with even greater efficiency to exert spin-orbit torques
(SOT) on adjacent ferromagnetic nanostructures. In parallel, there have been
wide ranging fundamental studies of the spin currents that can arise from
robust, intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI) effects in more exotic systems
including topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides with broken
crystalline symmetry, Weyl and Dirac semimetals where gapless electronic
excitations are protected by topology and symmetry. Here we experimentally
study strong SOT from the topological semimetal IrO2 in (001) and (110) normal
films, which exhibit distinctly different SHE strengths. Angle resolved
photoemission spectroscopy studies have shown IrO2 exhibits Dirac nodal lines
(DNL) in the band structure, which could enable a very high spin Hall
conductivity (SHC). The (001) films exhibit exceptionally high damping like
torque efficiency ranging from 0.45 at 293 K to 0.65 at 30 K which sets the
lower bound of SHC that is ten times higher and of opposite sign than the
theoretical prediction. We observe a substantial reduction of SHC in
anisotropically strained (110) films, which suggests that the DNLs that are
present in the (001) films and contribute to SHC, are disrupted and gapped due
to the large anisotropic strain in (110) films, which in turn significantly
lowers SHC. Very large value of SHC at room temperature of this Dirac semimetal
could be very promising for the practical application.

paper attempts to discover, and model perceptual acoustic units consisting of

correspond to CV, VC units, while the steady-state corresponds to sonorants and
fricatives. The speech signal is first preprocessed by segmenting the same into
CVC-like units using a short-term energy-like contour. These CVC segments are
clustered using a connected components-based graph clustering technique. The
clustered CVC segments are initialized such that the onset (CV) and decays (VC)
correspond to transients, and the rhyme corresponds to steady-states. Following
this initialization, the units are allowed to re-organise on the continuous
speech into a final set of AUs in an HMM-GMM framework. AU sequences thus
obtained are used to train synthesis models. The performance of the proposed

Hamiltonian operators leads to natural boundary conditions, and for models with
nearest-neighbor (NN) hoppings only, there are reference states that satisfy
the Hermiticity and boundary conditions simultaneously. Based on such reference

Hamiltonians for systems of cylindrical geometry. We show various examples of
such edge state Hamiltonians (ESHs), including Hofstadter model, graphene

excellent performance on tasks such as node classification. However, there is
inadequate understanding on how and why GNNs work, especially for node

understand GNNs, specifically, spectral graph convolutional networks and graph
attention networks, from graph signal denoising perspectives. Our framework
shows that GNNs are implicitly solving graph signal denoising problems:
spectral graph convolutions work as denoising node features, while graph
attentions work as denoising edge weights. We also show that a linear
self-attention mechanism is able to compete with the state-of-the-art graph
attention methods. Our theoretical results further lead to two new models,
GSDN-F and GSDN-EF, which work effectively for graphs with noisy node features
and/or noisy edges. We validate our theoretical findings and also the

  Boxes for Dense Object Detection","14 pages, 14 figures",,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  One-stage detector basically formulates object detection as dense
classification and localization. The classification is usually optimized by
Focal Loss and the box location is commonly learned under Dirac delta
distribution. A recent trend for one-stage detectors is to introduce an
individual prediction branch to estimate the quality of localization, where the
predicted quality facilitates the classification to improve detection
performance. This paper delves into the representations of the above three
fundamental elements: quality estimation, classification and localization. Two
problems are discovered in existing practices, including (1) the inconsistent
usage of the quality estimation and classification between training and
inference and (2) the inflexible Dirac delta distribution for localization when
there is ambiguity and uncertainty in complex scenes. To address the problems,
we design new representations for these elements. Specifically, we merge the
quality estimation into the class prediction vector to form a joint
representation of localization quality and classification, and use a vector to
represent arbitrary distribution of box locations. The improved representations
eliminate the inconsistency risk and accurately depict the flexible
distribution in real data, but contain continuous labels, which is beyond the
scope of Focal Loss. We then propose Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) that
generalizes Focal Loss from its discrete form to the continuous version for
successful optimization. On COCO test-dev, GFL achieves 45.0\% AP using
ResNet-101 backbone, surpassing state-of-the-art SAPD (43.5\%) and ATSS
(43.6\%) with higher or comparable inference speed, under the same backbone and
training settings. Notably, our best model can achieve a single-model
single-scale AP of 48.2\%, at 10 FPS on a single 2080Ti GPU. Code and models

  Biomedical Imaging",,,,,"eess.IV cs.CV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  Despite the widespread use of deep learning methods for semantic segmentation
of images that are acquired from a single source, clinicians often use
multi-domain data for a detailed analysis. For instance, CT and MRI have
advantages over each other in terms of imaging quality, artifacts, and output
characteristics that lead to differential diagnosis. The capacity of current
segmentation techniques is only allow to work for an individual domain due to
their differences. However, the models that are capable of working on all
modalities are essentially needed for a complete solution. Furthermore,
robustness is drastically affected by the number of samples in the training
step, especially for deep learning models. Hence, there is a necessity that all
available data regardless of data domain should be used for reliable methods.
For this purpose, this manuscript aims to implement a novel model that can
learn robust representations from cross-domain data by encapsulating distinct
and shared patterns from different modalities. Precisely, covariate shift
property is retained with structural modification and adversarial loss where
sparse and rich representations are obtained. Hence, a single parameter set is
used to perform cross-domain segmentation task. The superiority of the proposed
method is that no information related to modalities are provided in either
training or inference phase. The tests on CT and MRI liver data acquired in
routine clinical workflows show that the proposed model outperforms all other
baseline with a large margin. Experiments are also conducted on Covid-19
dataset that it consists of CT data where significant intra-class visual
differences are observed. Similarly, the proposed method achieves the best
performance.

could be a pre-existing Li overabundance resulting from binary mass transfer,
likely from a red giant branch star, because of the low barium abundance. To

based on the filtering of the low Mach number equations, suited to low Mach

formulations of the filtered low Mach number equations established with the
classical filter or the Favre filter. The two most significant subgrid terms of
the filtered low Mach number equations are considered. They are associated with
the momentum convection and the density-velocity correlation. We focus on
eddy-viscosity and eddy-diffusivity models. Subgrid-scale models from the
literature are analysed and two new models are proposed. The subgrid-scale

near-wall behaviour of the filter length. Eddy-viscosity and eddy-diffusivity

informatics. In the presence of strong magnetic anisotropy, they exhibit
magnetization blocking - a magnetic memory effect at the level of a single
molecule. Recent studies have shown that the SMM performance scales with the
height of magnetization blocking barrier. By employing molecular engineering
this can be significantly modified, remaining independent from other external
factors such as magnetic field. Taking advantage of hyperfine coupling of
electronic and nuclear spins further enhances their functionality, however, a
poor understanding of relaxation mechanisms in such SMMs limits the
exploitation of nuclear-spin molecular qubits. Here we report the opening
discovery of field-dependent oscillation of the magnetization blocking barrier
in a new holmium metallacrown magnet driven by the switch of relaxation
mechanisms involving hyperfine interaction. Single-crystal magnetic hysteresis
measurements combined with first-principles calculations reveal an activated
temperature dependence of magnetic relaxation dominated either by incoherent
quantum tunneling of magnetization at anti-crossing points of
exchange-hyperfine states or by Orbach-like processes at crossing points. We
demonstrate that these relaxation mechanisms can be consecutively switched on
and off by increasing the external field, which paves a way for manipulating
the magnetization dynamics of SMMs using hyperfine interaction.

desired target configuration, a typical (sub)task in robotics and automation,
arising in product assembly, packaging, stocking store shelves, and more. In
this paper we address a variant, which we call space-aware reconfiguration,
where the goal is to minimize the physical space needed for the
reconfiguration, while obeying constraints on the allowable collision-free
motions of the objects. Since for given start and target configurations,
reconfiguration may be impossible, we translate the entire target configuration
rigidly into a location that admits a valid sequence of moves, where each
object moves in turn just once, along a straight line, from its starting to its
target location, so that the overall physical space required by the start, all
intermediate, and target configurations for all the objects is minimized.
  We investigate two variants of space-aware reconfiguration for the often
examined setting of $n$ unit discs in the plane, depending on whether the discs
are distinguishable (labeled) or indistinguishable (unlabeled). For the labeled
case, we propose a representation of size $O(n^4)$ of the space of all feasible
initial rigid translations, and use it to find, in $O(n^6)$ time, a shortest
valid translation, or one that minimizes the enclosing disc or axis-aligned
rectangle of both the start and target configurations. For the significantly
harder unlabeled case, we show that for almost every direction, there exists a
translation in this direction that makes the problem feasible. We use this to
devise heuristic solutions, where we optimize the translation under stricter

quantum graphs. We first prove that, at the continuous level, the normalized
gradient flow is well-posed, mass-preserving, energy diminishing and converges
(at least locally) towards stationary states. We then establish the link

conducting a series of numerical experiments in model situations showing the

Passive Batch Injection Training Technique (PBITT), even reduces the level of

significant accuracy improvements. Passive Batch Injection Training Technique
(PBITT) introduces a few passive mini-batches into the training process that
contain data from a distribution that is different from the input data
distribution. This technique does not increase the number of parameters in the
final model and also does not increase the inference (test) time but still
improves the performance of deep CNNs. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work that makes use of different data distribution to aid the
training of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We thoroughly evaluate the
proposed approach on standard architectures: VGG, ResNet, and WideResNet, and
on several popular datasets: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet. We
observe consistent accuracy improvement by using the proposed technique. We
also show experimentally that the model trained by our technique generalizes
well to other tasks such as object detection on the MS-COCO dataset using
Faster R-CNN. We present extensive ablations to validate the proposed approach.

significant contributions from China to the atmospheric CO$_2$, which suggests
that, without the national restriction of activities, CO$_2$ concentration are
set to exceed 2019 by 1.79%, but it quickly decreased due to the lockdown, and
sustained the reduction for two consecutive months. The results underscore the
atmospheric CO$_2$ reductions on the monthly time scale that can be achieved,

useful for cost-benefit analyses of the reduction in electricity production

propositionalization and embedding data transformation approaches. While both
approaches aim at transforming data into tabular data format, they use
different terminology and task definitions, are perceived to address different

framework that allows for improved understanding of these two data
transformation techniques by presenting their unified definitions, and by
explaining the similarities and differences between the two approaches as
variants of a unified complex data transformation task. In addition to the
unifying framework, the novelty of this paper is a unifying methodology
combining propositionalization and embeddings, which benefits from the
advantages of both in solving complex data transformation and learning tasks.
We present two efficient implementations of the unifying methodology: an
instance-based PropDRM approach, and a feature-based PropStar approach to data

systems, it is well known that their common environment may act as an
entangling agent. In a perturbative regime the influence of the environment on
the system dynamics can effectively be described by a unitary and a dissipative
contribution. For the two-spin Boson model with (sub-) Ohmic spectral density
considered here, the particular unitary contribution (Lamb shift) easily
explains the buildup of entanglement between the two qubits. Furthermore it has
been argued that in the adiabatic limit, adding the so-called counterterm to
the microscopic model compensates the unitary influence of the environment and,
thus, inhibits the generation of entanglement. Investigating this assertion is
one of the main objectives of the work presented here. Using the hierarchy of
pure states (HOPS) method to numerically calculate the exact reduced dynamics,
we find and explain that the degree of inhibition crucially depends on the
parameter $s$ determining the low frequency power law behavior of the spectral
density $J(\omega) \sim \omega^s e^{-\omega/\omega_c}$. Remarkably, we find
that for resonant qubits, even in the adiabatic regime (arbitrarily large
$\omega_c$), the entanglement dynamics is still influenced by an
environmentally induced Hamiltonian interaction. Further, we study the model in
detail and present the exact entanglement dynamics for a wide range of coupling
strengths, distinguish between resonant and detuned qubits, as well as Ohmic
and deep sub-Ohmic environments. Notably, we find that in all cases the
asymptotic entanglement does not vanish and conjecture a linear relation
between the coupling strength and the asymptotic entanglement measured by means
of concurrence. Further we discuss the suitability of various perturbative
master equations for obtaining approximate entanglement dynamics.

We prove that similar to standard RNNs, the underlying reason for this issue is
the vanishing or exploding of the gradient during training. This phenomenon is
expressed by the ordinary differential equation (ODE) representation of the

designing a new algorithm based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) that
separates its memory from its time-continuous state. This way, we encode a

Results from global magnetoconvection simulations of solar-like
stars are at odds with observations in many respects: They show a surplus of
energy in the kinetic power spectrum at large scales, anti-solar differential
rotation profiles, with accelerated poles and a slow equator, for the solar
rotation rate, and a transition from axi- to non-axisymmetric dynamos at a much
lower rotation rate than what is observed. Even though the simulations
reproduce the observed active longitudes in fast rotators, their motion in the
rotational frame (the so-called azimuthal dynamo wave, ADW) is retrograde, in
contrast to the prevalent prograde motion in observations. Aims. We study the
effect of a more realistic treatment of heat conductivity in alleviating the
discrepancies between observations and simulations. Methods. We use
physically-motivated heat conduction, by applying Kramers opacity law, on a
semi-global spherical setup describing convective envelopes of solar-like
stars, instead of a prescribed heat conduction profile from mixing-length
arguments. Results. We find that some aspects of the results now better
correspond to observations: The axi- to non-axisymmetric transition point is
shifted towards higher rotation rates. We also find a change in the propagation
direction of ADWs so that also prograde waves are now found. The transition
from anti-solar to solar-like rotation profile, however, is also shifted
towards higher rotation rates, leaving the models into an even more unrealistic
regime. Conclusions. Although a Kramers-based heat conduction does not help in
reproducing the solar rotation profile, it does help in the faster rotation
regime, where the dynamo solutions now match better with observations.

could be far apart while those of a dense cluster have to be sufficiently
close. Following [16], we solve the problem of spectral clustering on

active galactic nuclei (AGN). Its exact shape and its correlation to other
quantities provide valuable information about the inner and outer regions of an
AGN. Our main goal is to study the reflection hump in a large sample of nearby
AGN. We aim to investigate the evolution of reflection with absorption and its
correlation with the spectral index. We analysed archived NuSTAR observations
of the 70-month BAT catalogue AGN. By performing a detailed spectral analysis,
we were able to constrain the spectral parameters and to investigate the
reflection emission in a large sample of individual sources. The reflection
strength was found to be strongly correlated with the power-law slope in
unabsorbed sources, pointing towards disc reflection for these sources.
Different possible explanations were tested and the most likely one is that the
corona is moving either towards or away from the disc with a moderately
relativistic velocity. An $R-\Gamma$ correlation was not detected for absorbed
sources. In addition, these AGN feature harder spectra, suggesting intrinsic
differences between the two classes or a slab geometry for the X-ray source.

various tubal configuration, namely aluminium foam filled corrugation tube and
tapered tube with graded thickness, to control the collapse mode, and minimize
the peak crushing force and fluctuations in force-displacement curves. Dynamic
crushing simulations were carried out using commercially available finite
element package ABAQUS explicit 6.13 at impact velocity of 60 km/h
(corresponding to 16.7 m/s). A comparative study on the dynamic crushing
behaviour of aluminum foam-filled tapered with graded thickness and corrugated
tubes were performed. The results showed that deformation mode of corrugated
tube is more controllable and predictable in the case of empty tubes. In foam
filled tubes the mode of deformation changing from diamond or mixed mode to
concertina mode which is useful for crashworthy applications. The crushing
force efficiency of foam filled tubes increases when compared with the empty
tubes because of a higher mean force which can be achieved by less fluctuations
in force-displacement curves. The effects of corrugation wavelength and
amplitude of corrugation tubes on the collapse mode, peak crushing force and
energy absorption were studied. Compared to the conventional straight circular
tube, initial peak force and fluctuation in the force-displacement curves of
corrugated tube is considerably less. Desired crashworthy characteristics can
be obtained by changing corrugation wavelength and amplitude of corrugated

Given a tolerant accuracy loss, without parameters setting, we begin from the
last convolutional layer to the first layer; for each considered layer with
less or equal pruning rate relative to its previous layer, our ABSHPC-based
process is applied to optimally partition all filters to clusters, where each
cluster is thus represented by the filter with the median root mean of the
hybrid pyramid, leading to maximal removal of redundant filters. Based on the
practical dataset and the CNN models, with higher accuracy, the thorough

The cosmic web, a complex network of galaxy groups and clusters
connected by filaments, is a dynamical environment in which galaxies form and
evolve. However, the impact of cosmic filaments on the properties of galaxies
is difficult to study because of the much more influential local (galaxy-group
scale) environment.
  Aims. The aim of this paper is to investigate the dependence of intrinsic
galaxy properties on distance to the nearest cosmic web filament, using a
sample of galaxies for which the local environment is easily assessable.}
  Methods. Our study is based on a volume-limited galaxy sample with
$M_\mathrm{r}$ $\leq -19$ mag, drawn from the SDSS DR12. We chose brightest
group galaxies (BGGs) in groups with two to six members as our probes of the
impact of filamentary environment because their local environment can be
determined more accurately. We use the Bisous marked point process method to
detect cosmic-web filaments with radii of $0.5-1.0$ Mpc and measure the
perpendicular filament spine distance ($D_{\mathrm{fil}}$) for the BGGs. We
limit our study to $D_{\mathrm{fil}}$ values up to 4 Mpc. We use the luminosity
density field as a tracer of the local environment. To achieve uniformity of
the sample and to reduce potential biases we only consider filaments longer
than 5 Mpc. Our final sample contains 1427 BGGs.
  Results. We note slight deviations between the galaxy populations inside and
outside the filament radius in terms of stellar mass, colour, the 4000AA break,
specific star formation rates, and morphologies. However, all these differences
remain below 95% confidence and are negligible compared to the effects arising
from local environment density.
  Conclusions. Within a 4 Mpc radius of the filament axes, the effect of
filaments on BGGs is marginal. The local environment is the main factor in
determining BGG properties.

recommender systems, with an important insight of vectorizing raw input
features into dense embeddings. The dimensions of different feature embeddings
are often set to a same value empirically, which limits the predictive
performance of latent factor models. Existing works have proposed heuristic or
reinforcement learning-based methods to search for mixed feature embedding
dimensions. For efficiency concern, these methods typically choose embedding
dimensions from a restricted set of candidate dimensions. However, this
restriction will hurt the flexibility of dimension selection, leading to
suboptimal performance of search results. In this paper, we propose
Differentiable Neural Input Search (DNIS), a method that searches for mixed
feature embedding dimensions in a more flexible space through continuous
relaxation and differentiable optimization. The key idea is to introduce a soft
selection layer that controls the significance of each embedding dimension, and
optimize this layer according to model's validation performance. DNIS is

is mainly due to the selection step of the algorithm that relies on matrix

systematically correctable framework to predict the complex relaxation dynamics
of glass-forming materials. The formal theory amounts to a hierarchy of
infinitely many coupled integro-differential equations, which may be
approximated using a suitable finite-order closure relation. Although previous
studies have suggested that finite-order GMCT leads to well-defined solutions,
and that the hierarchy converges as the closure level increases, no rigorous
and general result in this direction is known. Here we unambiguously establish
the existence and uniqueness of solutions to generic, schematic GMCT
hierarchies that are closed at arbitrary order. We consider two types of
commonly invoked closure approximations, namely mean-field and exponential
closures. We also distinguish explicitly between overdamped and underdamped
glassy dynamics, corresponding to hierarchies of first-order and second-order
integro-differential equations, respectively. We find that truncated GMCT
hierarchies closed under an exponential closure conform to previously developed
mathematical theories, such that the existence of a unique solution can be
readily inferred. Self-consistent mean-field closures, however, of which the
well-known standard-MCT closure approximation is a special case, warrant
additional arguments for mathematical rigour. We demonstrate that the existence
of a priori bounds on the solution is sufficient to also prove that unique
solutions exist for such self-consistent hierarchies. To complete our analysis,
we present simple arguments to show that these a priori bounds must exist,
motivated by the physical interpretation of the GMCT solutions as density
correlation functions. Overall, our work contributes to the theoretical
justification of GMCT for studies of the glass transition, placing GMCT on a
firmer mathematical footing.

locations Langmuir waves are accumulated. At these locations owing to the
ponderomotive force, Langmuir waves generate density depressions, where the
double layers with the thermal fronts, suppressing the hot electron flux, are
formed. We also show how protons are accelerated in these processes. Finally,
we compared the kappa and Maxwellian cases and discussed how these processes
could be observed.

enriched in interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMs), are known. Of them,
many are binary systems with the two components showing drastically different
molecular spectra. Two obvious questions arise. Why are hot corinos so
difficult to find and why do their binary components seem chemically different?
The answer to both questions could be a high dust opacity that would hide the
molecular lines. To test this hypothesis, we observed methanol lines at
centimeter wavelengths, where dust opacity is negligible, using the Very Large
Array interferometer. We targeted the NGC 1333 IRAS 4A binary system, for which
one of the two components, 4A1, has a spectrum deprived of iCOMs lines when
observed at millimeter wavelengths, while the other component, 4A2, is very
rich in iCOMs. We found that centimeter methanol lines are similarly bright
toward 4A1 and 4A2. Their non-LTE analysis indicates gas density and
temperature ($\geq2\times10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and 100--190 K), methanol column
density ($\sim10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$) and extent ($\sim$35 au in radius) similar in
4A1 and 4A2, proving that both are hot corinos. Furthermore, the comparison
with previous methanol line millimeter observations allows us to estimate the
optical depth of the dust in front of 4A1 and 4A2, respectively. The obtained
values explain the absence of iCOMs line emission toward 4A1 at millimeter
wavelengths and indicate that the abundances toward 4A2 are underestimated by
$\sim$30\%. Therefore, centimeter observations are crucial for the correct
study of hot corinos, their census, and their molecular abundances.

Moreover, the vacuum states of field on both sides are equivalent. On the
contrary, the correlator for the non-vacuum state does memorise the classical

which stack multiple convolutional, pooling and fully connected layers. While
convolutional and fully connected operations have been widely studied in the
literature, the design of pooling operations that handle action recognition,
with different sources of temporal granularity in action categories, has
comparatively received less attention, and existing solutions rely mainly on
max or averaging operations. The latter are clearly powerless to fully exhibit
the actual temporal granularity of action categories and thereby constitute a
bottleneck in classification performances. In this paper, we introduce a novel
hierarchical pooling design that captures different levels of temporal
granularity in action recognition. Our design principle is coarse-to-fine and
achieved using a tree-structured network; as we traverse this network top-down,
pooling operations are getting less invariant but timely more resolute and well
localized. Learning the combination of operations in this network -- which best
fits a given ground-truth -- is obtained by solving a constrained minimization
problem whose solution corresponds to the distribution of weights that capture
the contribution of each level (and thereby temporal granularity) in the global
hierarchical pooling process. Besides being principled and well grounded, the
proposed hierarchical pooling is also video-length and resolution agnostic.
Extensive experiments conducted on the challenging UCF-101, HMDB-51 and
JHMDB-21 databases corroborate all these statements.

final test performance based on a simple measure of training speed. Our

are not always adequate for very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emitting blazars.
While two-component models are performing better, they are difficult to
constrain due to the large number of free parameters. Aims. In this work, we
make a first attempt to take into account the observational constraints from
Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data, long-term light curves (radio,
optical, and X-rays) and optical polarisation to limit the parameter space for
a two-component model and test if it can still reproduce the observed spectral
energy distribution (SED) of the blazars. Methods. We selected five TeV BL Lac
objects based on the availability of VHE gamma-ray and optical polarisation
data. We collected constraints for the jet parameters from VLBI observations.
We evaluated the contributions of the two components to the optical flux by
means of decomposition of long-term radio and optical light curves as well as
modeling of the optical polarisation variability of the objects. We selected
eight epochs for these five objects, based on the variability observed at VHE
gamma rays, for which we constructed the SEDs that we then modeled with a
two-component model. Results. We found parameter sets which can reproduce the
broadband SED of the sources in the framework of two-component models
considering all available observational constraints from VLBI observations.
Moreover, the constraints obtained from the long-term behavior of the sources
in the lower energy bands could be used to determine the region where the
emission in each band originates. Finally, we attempted to use optical
polarisation data to shed new light on the behavior of the two components in
the optical band. Our observationally constrained two zone model allows
explanation of the entire SED from radio to VHE with two co-located emission
regions.

at the center of a suspended TMDC membrane, the excitons are transported to the
point of the highest strain at the center of the membrane. This effect, exciton
funneling, can be used to increase photoconversion efficiency in TMDC, to
explore exciton transport, and to study correlated states of excitons arising
at their high densities. Here, we analyze the limits of funneling efficiency in
realistic device geometries. The funneling efficiency in realistic monolayer
TMDCs is found to be low, $ <5 \;\%$ both at room and low temperatures. This
results from dominant diffusion at room temperature and short exciton lifetimes
at low temperatures. On the other hand, in TMDC heterostructures with long
exciton lifetimes the funneling efficiency reaches $\sim 50\;\%$ at room
temperature, as the exciton density reaches thermal equilibrium in the funnel.
Finally, we show that Auger recombination limits funneling efficiency for
intense illumination sources.

asymmetry of the total cross section and the azimuthal electron distributions

collective correlations among the atoms, spins or, in general, quantum systems
may prove to be a suitable method. As these correlations introduce interference
terms in the intensity of the scattering amplitudes, they may enhance the
signal as $N(N-1)$ for N correlated quantum systems. These correlations enhance
the signal to noise ratio by a factor of $N^2$ and contribute to better
sensitivity in quantum metrology. Moreover atomic correlation may provide
quantum noise limit, Heisenberg limit. In the present communication excitation
exchange induced by photons in a cavity between two atoms is calculated and
clearly exhibits correlation and collective effects. A novel operator is
introduced that expresses photon-induced excitation exchange that takes in
account energy conservation, $V_{ij}=\hat{a}^\dag\sigma_i\sigma_j^\dag\hat{a}$,
$\sigma_i=\left|g\right\rangle_{i}\left\langle e\right|_{i}$ is lowering
operator of $i$-th atom, and $\hat{a}^\dag,\hat{a}$ are photon creation and
annihilation operators. Here $i$ and $j$ stand for two atoms. This operator
describes real or virtual photon assisted dipole-dipole interaction. Moreover,
it conserves the total number of excitations in the joint em field and the
quantum system. Experimental challenges are suggested.

monolayered cell colonies in vitro, pronounced collective behavior with
swirl-like motion has been observed deep within a cell colony, while at the
same time, the colony remains cohesive, with not a single cell escaping at the
edge. Thus, the colony displays liquid-like properties inside, in coexistence
with a cell-free ""vacuum"" outside. How can adhesion be strong enough to keep
cells together, while at the same time not jam the system in a glassy state?
What kind of minimal model can describe such a behavior? Which other signatures
of activity arise from the internal fluidity? We propose a novel active
Brownian particle model with attraction, in which the interaction potential has
a broad minimum to give particles enough wiggling space to be collectively in
the fluid state. We demonstrate that for moderate propulsion, this model can
generate the fluid-vacuum coexistence described above. In addition, the
combination of the fluid nature of the colony with cohesion leads to preferred
orientation of the cell polarity, pointing outward, at the edge, which in turn
gives rise to a tensile stress in the colony -- as observed experimentally for
epithelial sheets. For stronger propulsion, collective detachment of cell
clusters is predicted. Further addition of an alignment preference of cell
polarity and velocity direction results in enhanced coordinated, swirl-like
motion, increased tensile stress and cell-cluster detachment.

backwards in time are not representative of the past evolution of real bodies.
Instead, these simulations are only useful as a means to quantify the short

survivors of populations of objects captured from interstellar space in the
early Solar System, these populations should have been implausibly large (e.g.
about 10 times the current main asteroid belt population for the retrograde
coorbital of Jupiter). More likely, the observed objects are just transient
members of a population that is maintained in quasi-steady state by a
continuous flux of objects from some parent reservoir in the distant Solar

non-standard source of r-process elements operating at such low metallicities.
One plausible explanation is that this enhancement originates from material
ejected at unusually fast velocities in a neutron star merger event. We also
explore the possibility that the neutron-capture elements were produced during
the evolution and explosion of a rotating massive star. In addition, based on
comparisons with yields from zero-metallicity faint supernova, we speculate
that RAVE J1830-4555 was formed from a gas cloud pre-enriched by both

explored such plasmas with constant density and observed the transverse shear
(TS) waves from a rotating vortex. Laboratory dusty plasmas are good examples
of homogeneous plasmas however heterogeneity (e.g. density, temperature,
charge) may be due to the existence of voids, different domains with different
orientations, presence of external forces like magnetic and/or electric,
size/charge imbalance, etc. Here, we examine how the density heterogeneity in
dusty plasmas responds to the circularly rotating vortex monopoles, namely
smooth and sharp cut-off. For this purpose we have carried out a series of
two-dimensional viscoelastic fluid simulations in the framework of generalized
hydrodynamics (GHD) fluid model. The rotating vortices are placed at the
interface of two incompressible fluids with different densities. The smooth
rotating vortex causes two things: First, the densities are stretched to form
the spiral density waves; secondly, the TS waves propagate radially into the
surrounding media according to the shear wave speed. We notice that the spiral
density arms are distinguishable in the early time while later get smeared out.
The sharp rotating vortex creates sharp shear flows which in turn favor the
Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability across the interfaces. In such flows for the
GHD system, the interplay between the emitted TS waves and the vortices of KH
instability distorts the formation of the regular spiral density arms around
the rotor

autoregressive teacher model for duration prediction (to provide more
information as input) and knowledge distillation (to simplify the data
distribution in output), which can ease the one-to-many mapping problem (i.e.,
multiple speech variations correspond to the same text) in TTS. However,
FastSpeech has several disadvantages: 1) the teacher-student distillation
pipeline is complicated and time-consuming, 2) the duration extracted from the
teacher model is not accurate enough, and the target mel-spectrograms distilled
from teacher model suffer from information loss due to data simplification,
both of which limit the voice quality. In this paper, we propose FastSpeech 2,
which addresses the issues in FastSpeech and better solves the one-to-many
mapping problem in TTS by 1) directly training the model with ground-truth
target instead of the simplified output from teacher, and 2) introducing more
variation information of speech (e.g., pitch, energy and more accurate
duration) as conditional inputs. Specifically, we extract duration, pitch and
energy from speech waveform and directly take them as conditional inputs in
training and use predicted values in inference. We further design FastSpeech
2s, which is the first attempt to directly generate speech waveform from text

design methodology called data-driven topology design. It is schemed to obtain
high-performance material distributions from initially given material
distributions in a given design domain. Its basic idea is to iterate the
following processes: (i) selecting material distributions from a dataset of
material distributions according to eliteness, (ii) generating new material
distributions using a deep generative model trained with the selected elite
material distributions, and (iii) merging the generated material distributions
with the dataset. Because of the nature of a deep generative model, the
generated material distributions are diverse and inherit features of the
training data, that is, the elite material distributions. Therefore, it is
expected that some of the generated material distributions are superior to the
current elite material distributions, and by merging the generated material
distributions with the dataset, the performances of the newly selected elite
material distributions are improved. The performances are further improved by
iterating the above processes. The usefulness of data-driven topology design is
demonstrated through numerical examples.

technique in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks for fast data aggregation from a
large number of wireless devices. However, as the number of devices becomes
large, the computational accuracy of AirComp would seriously degrade due to the
vanishing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To address this issue, we exploit the
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with hybrid beamforming, in order
to enhance the computational accuracy of AirComp in a cost-effective manner. In
particular, we consider the scenario with a large number of multi-antenna
devices simultaneously sending data to an access point (AP) equipped with
massive antennas for functional computation over the air. Under this setup, we
jointly optimize the transmit digital beamforming at the wireless devices and
the receive hybrid beamforming at the AP, with the objective of minimizing the
computational mean-squared error (MSE) subject to the individual transmit power
constraints at the wireless devices. To solve the non-convex hybrid beamforming
design optimization problem, we propose an alternating-optimization-based
approach. In particular, we propose two computationally efficient algorithms to
handle the challenging receive analog beamforming problem, by exploiting the
techniques of successive convex approximation (SCA) and block coordinate
descent (BCD), respectively. It is shown that for the special case with a
fully-digital receiver at the AP, the achieved MSE of the massive MIMO AirComp
system is inversely proportional to the number of receive antennas.
Furthermore, numerical results show that the proposed hybrid beamforming design
substantially enhances the computation MSE performance as compared to other
benchmark schemes, while the SCA-based algorithm performs closely to the
performance upper bound achieved by the fully-digital beamforming.

of 25 nearby face-on spiral galaxies using the ratio of mid-infrared PAH
emission to dust mass. Within 11 of the galaxies, we found that the PAH
excitation was straightforwardly linked to ultraviolet or mid-infrared star
formation tracers, which, along with other results studying the relation of PAH
emission to star formation, indicates that the PAHs are most strongly excited
in dusty shells around the star forming regions. Within another 5 galaxies, the
PAH emission is enhanced around star forming regions only at specific
galactocentric radii. In 6 more galaxies, PAH excitation is more strongly
correlated with the evolved stellar populations as traced by 3.6 micron
emission. The results for the remaining 3 galaxies were ambiguous. The radial
gradients of the PAH/dust ratios were generally not linked to log(O/H)
gradients except when the log(O/H) gradients were relatively steep. Galaxies in
which PAHs were excited by evolved stars had relatively high far-ultraviolet to
mid-infrared ratios, indicating that variations in the link between PAH
excitation and different stellar populations is linked to changes in dust
attenuation within galaxies. Alternately, differences in morphology could make
it more likely that PAHs are excited by evolved stars, as 5 of the 6 galaxies
where this occurs are late-type flocculent spiral galaxies. These heterogeneous
results demonstrate the complexity of describing PAH excitation and have broad
implications for using PAH emission as a star formation tracer as well as for
modelling dust emission and radiative transfer.

three-quarter filling on a simple dimer lattice and add random numbers to all
transfer integrals between nearest-neighbor sites. Photoinduced dynamics are
calculated using the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation by the exact
diagonalization method. Although the randomness tends to unsynchronize charge
oscillations on different bonds during and after photoexcitation, sufficiently
strong on-site repulsion $U$ overcomes this effect and synchronizes these
charge oscillations some time after strong photoexcitation. The degree of
synchronization is evaluated using an order parameter that is derived from the
time profiles of the current densities on all bonds. As to the nearest-neighbor
interaction $V$, if $V$ is weakly attractive, it increases the order parameter
by facilitating the charge oscillations. The relevance of these findings to
previously reported experimental and theoretical results for the organic

accelerate particles and generate shock waves which can arrive at Earth and can
disturb the magnetosphere. Understanding the association between CMEs and
CME-driven shocks is therefore highly important for space weather studies.
Aims: We present a study of the CME/flare event associated with two type II
bursts observed on September 27, 2012. The aim of the study is to understand
the relationship between the observed CME and the two distinct shock wave
signatures. Methods: The multi-wavelength study of the eruptive event
(CME/flare) was complemented with radio triangulation of the associated radio
emission and modelling of the CME and the shock wave employing MHD simulations.
Results: We found that, although temporal association between the type II
bursts and the CME is good, the low-frequency type II(LF-type II) burst occurs
significantly higher in the corona than the CME and its relationship to the CME
is not straightforward. The analysis of the EIT wave (coronal bright front)
shows the fastest wave component to be in the southeast quadrant of the Sun.
This is also the quadrant in which the source positions of the LF-type II were
found to be located, probably resulting from the interaction between the shock
wave and a streamer. Conclusions: The relationship between the CME/flare event
and the shock wave signatures is discussed using the temporal association,as
well as the spatial information of the radio emission. Further, we discuss the
importance and possible effects of the frequently non-radial propagation of the
shock wave.

certain standard relations, originating from the Slavnov-Taylor identities of
the theory, may be interpreted as ordinary differential equations for the
``kinetic term'' of the gluon propagator. The exact solutions of these
equations exhibit poles at the origin, which are incompatible with the physical
answer, known to diverge only logarithmically; their elimination hinges on the
validity of two integral conditions that we denominate ``asymmetric'' and
``symmetric'' sum rules, depending on the kinematics employed in their
derivation. The corresponding integrands contain components of the three-gluon
vertex and the ghost-gluon kernel, whose dynamics are constrained when the sum
rules are imposed. For the numerical treatment we single out the asymmetric sum
rule, given that its support stems predominantly from low and intermediate
energy regimes of the defining integral, which are physically more interesting.
Adopting a combined approach based on Schwinger-Dyson equations and lattice
simulations, we demonstrate how the sum rule clearly favors the suppression of
an effective form factor entering in the definition of its kernel. The results
of the present work offer an additional vantage point into the rich and complex

the low density environment it has mapped. A fraction of them are unusually
extended and have a low-surface brightness. Among these so-called ultra-diffuse
galaxies, a few seem to host an excess of globular clusters. With the
integral-field unit spectrograph MUSE we have observed one of these galaxies -
MATLAS J15052031+0148447 (MATLAS-2019) - located towards the nearby group NGC
5846 and measured its systemic velocity,age, and metallicity, and that of its
globular clusters candidates. For the stellar body of MATLAS-2019 we derive a
metallicity of -1.33+0.19-0.01 dex and an age of 11.2+1.8-0.8 Gyr. For some of
the individual GCs and the stacked GC population, we derive consistent ages and
metallicities. From the 11 confirmed globular clusters and using a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo approach we derived a dynamical mass-to-light ratio of
4.2+8.6-3.4M/L. This is at the lower end of the luminosity-mass scaling
relation defined by the Local Group dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, we couldn't
confirm nor reject the possibility of a rotational component of the GC system.
If present, this would further modify the inferred mass. Follow-up observations
of the globular cluster population and of the stellar body of the galaxy are
needed to assess whether this galaxy is lacking dark matter like it was
suggested for the pair of dwarf galaxies in the field of NGC 1052, or if this
is a miss-interpretation arising from systematic uncertainties of the method
commonly used for these systems and the large uncertainties of the individual
globular cluster velocities.

production in $e^+e^-$ and $pp$ colliders with their subsequent decays to four
charged leptons. We consider the Higgs Triplet Model (HTM) not restricted by
the custodial symmetry and the Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model (MLRSM). The
models include scalar triplets with different complexity of scalar potentials
and, due to experimental restrictions, completely different scales of
non-standard triplet vacuum expectation values. In both models, a doubly
charged Higgs boson $H^{\pm\pm}$ can acquire a mass of hundreds of
gigaelectronvolts, which can be probed at HL-LHC, future $e^+e^-$, and hadron
colliders. We take into account a comprehensive set of constraints on the
parameters of both models coming from neutrino oscillations, LHC, $e^+e^-$ and
low-energy lepton flavour violating data and assume the same mass of
$H^{\pm\pm}$. Our finding is that the $H^{\pm\pm}$ pair production in lepton
and hadron colliders is comparable in both models, though more pronounced in
MLRSM. We show that the decay branching ratios can be different within both
models, leading to distinguishable four lepton signals and that the strongest
are $4\mu$ events yielded by MLRSM. Typically we find that MLRSM signals are
one order of magnitude larger that in HTM. For example, the $pp \to 4\mu$ MLRSM
signal for 1 TeV $H^{\pm \pm}$ mass results in a clearly detectable
significance of $S \simeq 11$ for HL-LHC and $S \simeq 290$ for FCC-hh. Finally

in mind. In turn, this has given rise to adversarial examples, carefully
perturbed input samples aimed to mislead detection at test time, which have
been applied to attack spam and malware classification, and more recently to
attack image classification. Consequently, an abundance of research has been
devoted to designing machine learning methods that are robust to adversarial
examples. Unfortunately, there are desiderata besides robustness that a secure
and safe machine learning model must satisfy, such as fairness and privacy.
Recent work by Song et al. (2019) has shown, empirically, that there exists a
trade-off between robust and private machine learning models. Models designed
to be robust to adversarial examples often overfit on training data to a larger
extent than standard (non-robust) models. If a dataset contains private
information, then any statistical test that separates training and test data by
observing a model's outputs can represent a privacy breach, and if a model
overfits on training data, these statistical tests become easier.
  In this work, we identify settings where standard models will overfit to a
larger extent in comparison to robust models, and as empirically observed in
previous works, settings where the opposite behavior occurs. Thus, it is not
necessarily the case that privacy must be sacrificed to achieve robustness. The
degree of overfitting naturally depends on the amount of data available for
training. We go on to characterize how the training set size factors into the
privacy risks exposed by training a robust model on a simple Gaussian data
task, and show empirically that our findings hold on image classification
benchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.

setting, the dependency of the complexity of the distributed Lov\'asz Local
Lemma (LLL) on the chosen LLL criterion exhibits a sharp threshold phenomenon:
They proved that, under the LLL criterion $p2^d < 1$, if each random variable
affects at most $3$ events, the deterministic complexity of the LLL in the
LOCAL model is $O(d^2 + \log^* n)$. In stark contrast, under the criterion
$p2^d \leq 1$, there is a randomized lower bound of $\Omega(\log \log n)$ by
Brandt et al. [STOC'16] and a deterministic lower bound of $\Omega(\log n)$ by
Chang, Kopelowitz and Pettie [FOCS'16]. Brandt, Maus and Uitto conjectured that
the same behavior holds for the unrestricted setting where each random variable
affects arbitrarily many events.
  We prove their conjecture, by providing an algorithm that solves the LLL in
time $O(d^2 + \log^* n)$ under the LLL criterion $p2^d < 1$, which is tight in
bounded-degree graphs due to an $\Omega(\log^* n)$ lower bound by Chung, Pettie
and Su [PODC'14]. By the work of Brandt, Maus and Uitto, obtaining such an
algorithm can be reduced to proving that all members in a certain family of
functions in arbitrarily high dimensions are convex on some specific domain.
Unfortunately, an analytical description of these functions is known only for
dimension at most $3$, which led to the aforementioned restriction of their
result. While obtaining those descriptions for functions of (substantially)
higher dimension seems out of the reach of current techniques, we show that
their convexity can be inferred by combinatorial means.

manufactured at a trusted low-end foundry. This approach hides the BEOL
connections from the untrusted foundry, thus preventing overproduction and
piracy threats. However, many works demonstrate that BEOL connections can be
derived by exploiting layout characteristics that are introduced by heuristics
employed in typical floorplanning, placement, and routing algorithms. Since
straightforward Split Manufacturing may not afford a desirable security level,
many authors propose defense techniques to be used along with Split
Manufacturing. In our survey, we present a detailed overview of the technique,
the many types of attacks towards Split Manufacturing, as well as possible
defense techniques described in the literature. For the attacks, we present a
concise discussion on the different threat models and assumptions, while for
the defenses we classify the studies into three categories: proximity
perturbation, wire lifting, and layout obfuscation. The main outcome of our
survey is to highlight the discrepancy between many studies -- some claim
netlists can be reconstructed with near perfect precision, while others claim
marginal success in retrieving BEOL connections. Finally, we also discuss
future trends and challenges inherent to Split Manufacturing, including the
fundamental difficulty of evaluating the efficiency of the technique.

  A Conditional Subgroup Approach",,,,,"stat.ML cs.LG","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  The interpretation of feature importance in machine learning models is
challenging when features are dependent. Permutation feature importance (PFI)
ignores such dependencies, which can cause misleading interpretations due to
extrapolation. A possible remedy is more advanced conditional PFI approaches
that enable the assessment of feature importance conditional on all other
features. Due to this shift in perspective and in order to enable correct
interpretations, it is therefore important that the conditioning is transparent
and humanly comprehensible. In this paper, we propose a new sampling mechanism
for the conditional distribution based on permutations in conditional
subgroups. As these subgroups are constructed using decision trees
(transformation trees), the conditioning becomes inherently interpretable. This
not only provides a simple and effective estimator of conditional PFI, but also
local PFI estimates within the subgroups. In addition, we apply the conditional
subgroups approach to partial dependence plots (PDP), a popular method for
describing feature effects that can also suffer from extrapolation when
features are dependent and interactions are present in the model. We show that
PFI and PDP based on conditional subgroups often outperform methods such as
conditional PFI based on knockoffs, or accumulated local effect plots.
Furthermore, our approach allows for a more fine-grained interpretation of
feature effects and importance within the conditional subgroups.

further uses the framework to examine the explicit and implicit assumptions

the key statistic in a large variety of multivariate statistical procedures,

partially observed, the sample covariance matrix from the available data is
biased and does not provide valid multivariate procedures. To correct the bias,
a simple adjustment method called inverse probability weighting (IPW) has been
used in previous research, yielding the IPW estimator. The estimator plays the
role of $\boldsymbol{S}$ in the missing data context so that it can be plugged
into off-the-shelf multivariate procedures. However, theoretical properties
(e.g. concentration) of the IPW estimator have been only established under very
simple missing structures; every variable of each sample is independently
subject to missing with equal probability.
  We investigate the deviation of the IPW estimator when observations are
partially observed under general missing dependency. We prove the optimal
convergence rate $O_p(\sqrt{\log p / n})$ of the IPW estimator based on the
element-wise maximum norm. We also derive similar deviation results even when
implicit assumptions (known mean and/or missing probability) are relaxed. The
optimal rate is especially crucial in estimating a precision matrix, because of
the ""meta-theorem"" that claims the rate of the IPW estimator governs that of
the resulting precision matrix estimator. In the simulation study, we discuss
non-positive semi-definiteness of the IPW estimator and compare the estimator
with imputation methods, which are practically important.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the transient

with the voltage ramp rate. We observe that the voltage window initially
increases and later decreases as the ramp rate is increased - while the current
window reduces monotonically. Second, an analytical electrothermal model based
on space charge limited current (SCLC) and Fourier Heat equation is proposed to
model the co-dependent heat and current flow. Finally, we show that the
interplay between the self-heating due to the current and the current
dependence on the temperature is accurately modeled to reproduce the hysteresis

immense. This has prompted the development of Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
techniques to automate this design. However, NAS algorithms tend to be slow and
expensive; they need to train vast numbers of candidate networks to inform the
search process. This could be alleviated if we could partially predict a
network's trained accuracy from its initial state. In this work, we examine the
overlap of activations between datapoints in untrained networks and motivate
how this can give a measure which is usefully indicative of a network's trained
performance. We incorporate this measure into a simple algorithm that allows us
to search for powerful networks without any training in a matter of seconds on
a single GPU, and verify its effectiveness on NAS-Bench-101, NAS-Bench-201,
NATS-Bench, and Network Design Spaces. Our approach can be readily combined
with more expensive search methods; we examine a simple adaptation of
regularised evolutionary search. Code for reproducing our experiments is

entangled network with the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the graph
convolutional network (GCN), which input the visual features from CNN to GCN to
model the implicit semantic relations, then GCN feedback the graph modeled
information to CNN features; 2. it uses attribute word vectors as the target
for the graph semantic modeling of GCN, which forms a self-consistent
regression for graph modeling and supervise GCN to learn more personalized
attribute relations; 3. it fuses and supplements the hierarchical
visual-semantic features refined by graph modeling into visual embedding. Our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on multiple representative ZSL

We first prove that the satisfiability problem for D, over finite linear

set of special-purpose privacy-preserving techniques exist in computer science,

evaluations at adaptively chosen inputs $x$. In this paper, we consider
multi-objective optimization, where $f(x)$ outputs a vector of possibly
competing objectives and the goal is to converge to the Pareto frontier.
Quantitatively, we wish to maximize the standard hypervolume indicator metric,
which measures the dominated hypervolume of the entire set of chosen inputs. In
this paper, we introduce a novel scalarization function, which we term the
hypervolume scalarization, and show that drawing random scalarizations from an
appropriately chosen distribution can be used to efficiently approximate the
hypervolume indicator metric. We utilize this connection to show that Bayesian
optimization with our scalarization via common acquisition functions, such as
Thompson Sampling or Upper Confidence Bound, provably converges to the whole
Pareto frontier by deriving tight hypervolume regret bounds on the order of
$\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, we highlight the general utility of our
scalarization framework by showing that any provably convergent
single-objective optimization process can be effortlessly converted to a
multi-objective optimization process with provable convergence guarantees.

stores, as they provide low latency random access, high write throughput, high

persistent data stores, and indeed they lie at the backbone of many of the data
management systems used in production and research today. In this paper, we
show that benchmarking a persistent tree-based data structure on an SSD is a
complex process, which may easily incur subtle pitfalls that can lead to an
inaccurate performance assessment. At a high-level, these pitfalls stem from
the interaction of complex software running on complex hardware. On one hand,
tree structures implement internal operations that have nontrivial effects on
performance. On the other hand, SSDs employ firmware logic to deal with the
idiosyncrasies of the underlying flash memory, which are well known to lead to
complex performance dynamics. We identify seven benchmarking pitfalls using
RocksDB and WiredTiger, two widespread implementations of an LSM-Tree and a
B+Tree, respectively. We show that such pitfalls can lead to incorrect
measurements of key performance indicators, hinder the reproducibility and the
representativeness of the results, and lead to suboptimal deployments in

popularity in space physics. In particular, the forecasting of geomagnetic
indices with neural network models is becoming a popular field of study. These
models are evaluated with metrics such as the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and
Pearson correlation coefficient. However, these classical metrics sometimes
fail to capture crucial behavior. To show where the classical metrics are
lacking, we trained a neural network, using a long short-term memory network,
to make a forecast of the disturbance storm time index at origin time $t$ with
a forecasting horizon of 1 up to 6 hours, trained on OMNIWeb data. Inspection
of the model's results with the correlation coefficient and RMSE indicated a
performance comparable to the latest publications. However, visual inspection
showed that the predictions made by the neural network were behaving similarly
to the persistence model. In this work, a new method is proposed to measure
whether two time series are shifted in time with respect to each other, such as
the persistence model output versus the observation. The new measure, based on
Dynamical Time Warping, is capable of identifying results made by the
persistence model and shows promising results in confirming the visual
observations of the neural network's output. Finally, different methodologies
for training the neural network are explored in order to remove the persistence
behavior from the results.

sequences of the measured traffic flow from all sensors and predicts the future

an appropriate polynomial, rather than logarithmic, bonus term in the upper
confidence bounds. Such a polynomial bonus is motivated by its empirical
successes in AlphaGo Zero (Silver et al., 2017b), as well as its significant
role in achieving theoretical guarantees of finite space MCTS (Shah et al.,

clustering framework. Given a finite set of input points, and an oracle
revealing whether any two points lie in the same cluster, our goal is to
recover all clusters exactly using as few queries as possible. To this end, we
relax the spherical $k$-means cluster assumption of Ashtiani et al.\ to allow
for arbitrary ellipsoidal clusters with margin. This removes the assumption
that the clustering is center-based (i.e., defined through an optimization
problem), and includes all those cases where spherical clusters are
individually transformed by any combination of rotations, axis scalings, and
point deletions. We show that, even in this much more general setting, it is
still possible to recover the latent clustering exactly using a number of
queries that scales only logarithmically with the number of input points. More
precisely, we design an algorithm that, given $n$ points to be partitioned into
$k$ clusters, uses $O(k^3 \ln k \ln n)$ oracle queries and $\tilde{O}(kn +
k^3)$ time to recover the clustering with zero misclassification error. The
$O(\cdot)$ notation hides an exponential dependence on the dimensionality of
the clusters, which we show to be necessary thus characterizing the query
complexity of the problem. Our algorithm is simple, easy to implement, and can
also learn the clusters using low-stretch separators, a class of ellipsoids
with additional theoretical guarantees. Experiments on large synthetic datasets
confirm that we can reconstruct clusterings exactly and efficiently.

  note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2009.00972, arXiv:2011.00732",,,,"q-fin.PM math.PR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We give a definitive treatment of duality for optimal consumption over the
infinite horizon, in a semimartingale incomplete market satisfying no unbounded
profit with bounded risk (NUPBR). Rather than base the dual domain on (local)
martingale deflators, we use a class of supermartingale deflators such that
deflated wealth plus cumulative deflated consumption is a supermartingale for
all admissible consumption plans. This yields a strong duality, because the
enlarged dual domain of processes dominated by deflators is naturally closed,
without invoking its closure. In this way we automatically reach the bipolar of
the set of deflators. We complete this picture by proving that the set of
processes dominated by local martingale deflators is dense in our dual domain,
confirming that we have identified the natural dual space. In addition to the
optimal consumption and deflator, we characterise the optimal wealth process.
At the optimum, deflated wealth is a supermartingale and a potential, while
deflated wealth plus cumulative deflated consumption is a uniformly integrable
martingale. This is the natural generalisation of the corresponding feature in
the terminal wealth problem, where deflated wealth at the optimum is a
uniformly integrable martingale. We use no constructions involving equivalent
local martingale measures. This is natural, given that such measures typically
do not exist over the infinite horizon and that we are working under NUPBR,
which does not require their existence. The structure of the duality proof
reveals an interesting feature compared with the terminal wealth problem.
There, the dual domain is $L^{1}$-bounded, but here the primal domain has this
property, and hence many steps in the duality proof show a marked reversal of
roles for the primal and dual domains, compared with the proofs of Kramkov and
Schachermayer.

the cluster color-magnitude diagram is corrected by differential reddening and
spans mass ratios (q) values from 0.5 up to 1.0. Its stellar density radial
profile and cumulative distribution as a function of the distance from the
cluster's center reveal that it extends out to the observed boundaries of the
cluster's tidal tails (~ 6 times the cluster's radius) following a spatial
distribution indistinguishable from that of cluster Main Sequence (MS) stars.
Furthermore, binary stars with q values smaller or larger than 0.75 do not show
any spatial distribution difference either. From Gaia DR2 astrometric and
kinematics data we computed Galactic coordinates and space velocities with
respect to the cluster's center and mean cluster space velocity, respectively.
We found that, cluster members located all along the tidal tails, irrespective
of being a single or binary star, move relatively fast. The projection of their
motions on the Galactic plane resembles that of a rotating solid body, while
those along the radial direction from the Galactic center and perpendicular to
the Galactic plane suggest that the cluster is being disrupted. The similarity
of the spatial distributions and kinematic patterns of cluster MS and binary

apparently swept out any signature of internal dynamic evolution like mass
segregation driven by two-body relaxation.

different areas ranging form biology via epidemics to economics and
engineering. Unexpected behaviour of dynamic systems or even systems failure is
sometimes difficult to comprehend. Such unexpected dynamics can be caused by
systematic model errors, unknown inputs from the environment and systems
faults. Localizing the root cause of these errors or faults and reconstructing
their dynamics is only possible if the measured outputs of the system are
sufficiently informative. Here, we present a mathematical theory for the
measurements required to localize the position of error sources in large
dynamic networks. We assume, that faults or errors occur at a limited number of
positions in the network. This sparsity assumption facilitates the accurate
reconstruction of the dynamic timecourses of the errors by solving a convex
optimal control problem. For cases, where the sensor measurements are not
sufficiently informative to pinpoint the error position exactly, we provide
methods to restrict the error location to a smaller subset of network nodes. We
also suggest strategies to efficiently select additional measurements for
narrowing down the error location.

medium non-Gaussianity, i.e. problems where the prior is very non-Gaussian but
the posterior is approximately Gaussian. Such situations arise, e.g., when
nonlinear dynamics produce a non-Gaussian forecast but a tight Gaussian
likelihood leads to a nearly-Gaussian posterior. The hybrid filter starts by
factoring the likelihood. First the particle filter assimilates the
observations with one factor of the likelihood to produce an intermediate prior
that is close to Gaussian, and then the ensemble Kalman filter completes the
assimilation with the remaining factor. How the likelihood gets split between
the two stages is determined in such a way to ensure that the particle filter
avoids collapse, and particle degeneracy is broken by a mean-preserving random
orthogonal transformation. The hybrid is tested in a simple two-dimensional
(2D) problem and a multiscale system of ODEs motivated by the Lorenz-`96 model.
In the 2D problem it outperforms both a pure particle filter and a pure
ensemble Kalman filter, and in the multiscale Lorenz-`96 model it is shown to
outperform a pure ensemble Kalman filter, provided that the ensemble size is
large enough.

unaltered calculation rules. In some cases the results are valid, but in other

distribution. Despite the abundance of numerical studies, many questions still
remain unanswered, ultimately limiting the inclusion of heat effects in
mesocale atmospheric models. Of interest in this study is the assessment of
radiative processes at building walls in terms of emissivity (i.e. is the ratio
of the thermal radiation from a surface to the radiation from an ideal black
surface at the same temperature), shape factors (i.e. the proportion of the
radiation which leaves the surface of a building and strikes toward the surface
of another building) and their relation to the Richardson number. The study is
approached via the computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM, with large eddy
simulations (LES) extension to model turbulence within the canyon and
Boussinesq approach to model heat transfer. Consequences on pollutant
concentrations are also analysed. A model for setting the thermal boundary
conditions on the building surfaces is developed, based on a database that
gives the correlations between the emissivity of a surface and the heat flux
emitted by this surface, under certain weather conditions, as a function of the
latitude and longitude of the surface, the orientation, the time of the day. As
a novel result an exponential law between the transfer coefficient and Ri (as
well as with the emissivity) is proposed as a function of the canyon aspect
ratio.

feature is that it has a solution consisting of N spikes that undergoes a Hopf
bifurcation with respect to N distinct modes nearly simultaneously. This
results in complex oscillatory dynamics of the spikes, not seen in typical
two-component models. For parameter values above the Hopf bifurcations, we
derive reduced equations of motion which consist of coupled ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) of order 2N for spike positions and their
velocities. These ODEs fully describe the slow-time evolution of the spikes
near the Hopf bifurcations. We then apply the method of multiple scales to the
resulting ODEs to derive long-time dynamics. For a single spike, we find that
its long-time motion consists of oscillations near the steady-state whose
amplitude can be computed explicitly. For two spikes, the long-time behaviour
can be either in-phase or out-of-phase oscillations. Both in and out of phase
orbits are stable, coexist for the same parameter values, and the fate of orbit
depends solely on the initial conditions. Further away from the Hopf
bifurcation point, we offer numerical experiments indicating the existence of
highly complex and chaotic oscillations.

possible by rapid real-time stable learning of the unknown dynamics using
H\""{o}lder-continuous learning schemes that are designed as discrete-time
stable disturbance observers. This observer learns from prior input-output
history and it ensures finite-time stable convergence of model estimation
errors to a bounded neighborhood of the zero vector if the system is known to
be Lipschitz-continuous with respect to outputs, inputs, internal parameters
and states, and time. In combination with nonlinearly stable controller
designs, this makes the proposed framework nonlinearly stable and robust to
disturbances, model uncertainties, and unknown measurement noise. Nonlinear
stability and robustness analyses of the observer and controller designs are
carried out using discrete Lyapunov analysis. H\""{o}lder-continuous Finite-time
stable observer and controller designs in this framework help to prove
robustness of these schemes and guaranteed convergence of outputs to a bounded

  arXiv:2005.10955",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Modeling flows in fractured porous media is important in applications. One
main challenge in numerical simulation is that the flow is strongly influenced
by the fractures, so that the solutions typically contain complex features,
which require high computational grid resolutions. Instead of using uniformly
fine mesh, a more computationally efficient adaptively refined mesh is
desirable. In this paper we design and analyze a novel residual-type a
posteriori error estimator for staggered DG methods on general polygonal meshes
for Darcy flows in fractured porous media. The method can handle fairly general
meshes and hanging nodes can be simply incorporated into the construction of
the method, which is highly appreciated for adaptive mesh refinement. The
reliability and efficiency of the error estmator are proved. The derivation of
the reliability hinges on the stability of the continuous setting in the primal
formulation. A conforming counterpart that is continuous within each bulk
domain for the discrete bulk pressure is defined to facilitate the derivation
of the reliability. Finally, several numerical experiments including multiple
non-intersecting fractures are carried out to confirm the proposed theories.

approach. In particular, we explore the impact of epitaxial compressive strain
that experience (Nd,Sr)NiO$_2$ films on the electronic properties, magnetic
correlations, and exchange couplings. Our results reveal the crucial importance
of orbital-dependent correlation effects in the Ni $3d$ shell of Sr-doped
NdNiO$_2$. Upon doping with Sr, it undergoes a Lifshitz transition which is
accompanied by a reconstruction of magnetic correlations: For Sr $x<0.2$
(Nd,Sr)NiO$_2$ adopts the N\'eel $(111)$ antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, while
for $x>0.2$ the $C$-type $(110)$ AFM sets in the unstrained (Nd,Sr)NiO$_2$,
with a highly frustrated region at $x \simeq 0.2$, all within DFT+DMFT at
$T=290$ K. Our results for the N\'eel AFM at Sr $x=0$ suggest that AFM
NdNiO$_2$ appears at the verge of a Mott-Hubbard transition, providing a
plausible explanation for the experimentally observed weakly insulating
behavior of NdNiO$_2$ for Sr $x<0.1$. We observe that the Lifshitz transition
makes a change of the band structure character from electron- to hole-like with
Sr $x$, in agreement with recent experiments. Our results for magnetic
couplings demonstrate an unanticipated frustration of the Ni $3d$ magnetic
moments, which suppresses magnetic order near Sr $x=0.2$. We find that the
effect of frustration is maximal for Sr doping $x \simeq 0.1-0.2$ that nearly
corresponds to the experimentally observed doping value. We conclude that the
in-plane strain adjusts a bandwidth of the Ni $x^2-y^2$ band, i.e., controls
the effect of electron correlations in the Ni $x^2-y^2$ orbitals. The
electronic properties of (Nd,Sr)NiO$_2$ reveal an anomalous sensitivity upon a
change of the crystal structure parameters.

In this
paper, I consider the possibility that some fundamental laws are vague. I call
this phenomenon 'fundamental nomic vagueness.' I characterize fundamental nomic
vagueness as the existence of borderline lawful worlds and the presence of
several other accompanying features. Under certain assumptions, such vagueness
prevents the fundamental physical theory from being completely expressible in
the mathematical language. Moreover, I suggest that such vagueness can be
regarded as 'vagueness in the world.' For a case study, we turn to the Past
Hypothesis, a postulate that (partially) explains the direction of time in our
world. We have reasons to take it seriously as a candidate fundamental law of
nature. Yet it is vague: it admits borderline (nomologically) possible worlds.
An exact version would lead to an untraceable arbitrariness absent in any other
fundamental laws. However, the dilemma between fundamental nomic vagueness and
untraceable arbitrariness is dissolved in a new quantum theory of time's arrow.

hyperbolic/saddle critical point (HSP) and its relationship with the divergence
of pressure force/fluid flux are numerically investigated at low Reynolds
numbers. Three canonical configurations at different Reynolds numbers are
considered: (a) an isolated circular cylinder; (b) side-by-side circular
cylinders and (c) a near-wall circular cylinder. The objective is to
investigate the behavior of a HSP subjecting to imbalanced shear-layer
interaction and different Reynolds numbers. It is found that a HSP evolves
along the shear-layer interfaces and imposes adverse pressure gradients, which
potentially deteriorates near-wake stability. The inherent characteristics of a
HSP is linked with net positive fluid-fluid divergence and fluid three
dimensionality. A vorticity-free stagnant zone is formed around a HSP, which
cut the kinetic energy supply of shear layers in wake, project
third-dimensional fluid fluxes and develops three-dimensional streamwise
braids. These findings are confirmed and explained via the quantification of
the fluid-flux divergence, the hydrodynamic responses of cylinder(s) and the
secondary enstrophy. The primary focus in this article is to reveal the subtle
analytical relationships between HSP, divergence of pressure force/fluid flux,
fluid three dimensionality and imbalanced shear-layer interaction. To the
knowledge of authors, so far these analytical relationships have not been
reported in literature.

slow intruders is derived. This contribution is associated with sudden
charge-changing cycles during the path of projectiles. The sum of the novel and
the well-known conventional contributions, both expressed in terms of
scattering phase shifts, are used to discuss experimental data obtained for
different targets. It is found that our two-channel modeling, with two
nonlinear channels, improves the agreement between several data and theory and
thus, as predictive modeling, can contribute to the desired convergence between
experimental and theoretical attempts on the retarding force.

are observed heterogeneously with increasing strain, and these correlate with
local lattice rotations near matrix-intermetallic compound interfaces.
Recrystallised grains have either twin or special boundary relationships to
their parent grains. The combination of these two imaging methods reveal one
grain (loading direction, LD, 10.4 {\deg} from [100]) deforms less than the

cloud-based intelligent services for mobile users. Such a service requires a
user to send data, e.g. image, voice and video, to the provider, which presents
a serious challenge to user privacy. To address this, prior works either
obfuscate the data, e.g. add noise and remove identity information, or send
representations extracted from the data, e.g. anonymized features. They
struggle to balance between the service utility and data privacy because
obfuscated data reduces utility and extracted representation may still reveal
sensitive information.
  This work departs from prior works in methodology: we leverage adversarial
learning to a better balance between privacy and utility. We design a
\textit{representation encoder} that generates the feature representations to
optimize against the privacy disclosure risk of sensitive information (a
measure of privacy) by the \textit{privacy adversaries}, and concurrently
optimize with the task inference accuracy (a measure of utility) by the
\textit{utility discriminator}. The result is the privacy adversarial network
(\systemname), a novel deep model with the new training algorithm, that can
automatically learn representations from the raw data.
  Intuitively, PAN adversarially forces the extracted representations to only
convey the information required by the target task. Surprisingly, this
constitutes an implicit regularization that actually improves task accuracy. As
a result, PAN achieves better utility and better privacy at the same time! We
report extensive experiments on six popular datasets and demonstrate the
superiority of \systemname compared with alternative methods reported in prior
work.

to the lack of data integrity and origin authentication within it. This paper
focuses on one particular security vulnerability, namely typo-squatting.
Typo-squatting refers to the registration of a domain name that is extremely
similar to that of an existing popular brand with the goal of redirecting users

majority-voting based classifier, by proposing an ensemble-based feature
selection and bagging classification model to detect DNS typo-squatting attack.
Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves high accuracy
and precision in identifying the malicious/suspicious typo-squatting domains (a
loss of at most 1.5% in accuracy and 5% in precision when compared to the model
that used the complete feature set) while having a lower computational
complexity due to the smaller feature set (a reduction of more than 50% in
feature set size).

applications. The state of the art techniques for travel time estimation use
GPS traces to learn the weights of a road network, often modeled as a directed

is then computed as the sum of edge weights on the returned path. In order to
enable time-dependency, existing systems compute multiple weighted graphs
corresponding to different time windows. These graphs are often optimized
offline before they are deployed into production routing engines, causing a
serious engineering overhead. In this paper, we present STAD, a system that
adjusts - on the fly - travel time estimates for any trip request expressed in
the form of origin, destination, and departure time. STAD uses machine learning
and sparse trips data to learn the imperfections of any basic routing engine,
before it turns it into a full-fledged time-dependent system capable of
adjusting travel times to real traffic conditions in a city. STAD leverages the
spatio-temporal properties of traffic by combining spatial features such as
departing and destination geographic zones with temporal features such as
departing time and day to significantly improve the travel time estimates of
the basic routing engine. Experiments on real trip datasets from Doha, New York

applicable across many application domains requiring human-robot interaction.
In this work, we show that it is possible to learn generative models for
distinct user behavioural types, extracted from human demonstrations, by
enforcing clustering of preferred task solutions within the latent space. We
use these models to differentiate between user types and to find cases with
overlapping solutions. Moreover, we can alter an initially guessed solution to
satisfy the preferences that constitute a particular user type by
backpropagating through the learned differentiable models. An advantage of
structuring generative models in this way is that we can extract causal
relationships between symbols that might form part of the user's specification
of the task, as manifested in the demonstrations. We further parameterize these
specifications through constraint optimization in order to find a safety
envelope under which motion planning can be performed. We show that the
proposed method is capable of correctly distinguishing between three user
types, who differ in degrees of cautiousness in their motion, while performing
the task of moving objects with a kinesthetically driven robot in a tabletop
environment. Our method successfully identifies the correct type, within the
specified time, in 99% [97.8 - 99.8] of the cases, which outperforms an IRL
baseline. We also show that our proposed method correctly changes a default
trajectory to one satisfying a particular user specification even with unseen
objects. The resulting trajectory is shown to be directly implementable on a
PR2 humanoid robot completing the same task.
