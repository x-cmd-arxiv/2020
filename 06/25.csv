  Hole binaries","Submitted version. 6 pages and 3 figures",,,,"astro-ph.CO astro-ph.HE gr-qc","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Gravitational lensing allows the detection of binary black holes (BBH) at
cosmological distances with chirp masses that appear to be enhanced by $1+z$ in
the range $1<z<4$, in good agreement with the reported BBH masses. We propose
this effect also accounts for the puzzling ""mass gap"" events (MG) newly
reported by LIGO/Virgo, as distant, lensed NSBH events with $1<z<4$. The fitted
mass of the neutron star member becomes $(1+z)\times 1.4M_\odot$, and is
therefore misclassified as a low mass black hole. In this way, we derive a
redshift of $z\simeq 3.5$ and $z\simeq 1.0$ for two newly reported ""mass
asymmetric"" events GW190412 \& GW190814, by interpreting them as lensed NSBH
events, comprising a stellar mass black hole and neutron star. Over the past
year an additional 31 BBH events and 5 MG events have been reported with high
probability ($>95\%$), from which we infer a factor $\simeq 5$ higher intrinsic
rate of NSBH events than BBH events, reflecting a higher proportion of neutron
stars formed by early star formation. We predict a distinctive locus for lensed
NSBH events in the observed binary mass plane, spanning $1<z<4$ with a narrow
mass ratio, $q \simeq 0.2$, that can be readily tested when the waveform data
are unlocked. All such events may show disrupted NS emission and are worthy of
prompt follow-up as the high lensing magnification means EM detections are not
prohibitive despite the high redshifts that we predict. Such lensed NSBH events
provide an exciting prospect of directly charting the history of coalescing
binaries via the cosmological redshift of their waveforms, determined relative
to the characteristic mass of the neutron star member.

population depends on agriculture for their livelihood. This makes agriculture
a critical sector within the African continent. Nonetheless, agricultural
productivity is low and food insecurity is still a challenge. This has in
recent years led to several initiatives in using ICT (Information Communication
Technology) to improve agriculture productivity. This study aims to explore ICT
innovations in the agriculture sector of Africa. To achieve this, we conducted
a SLR (Systematic Literature Review) of the literature published since 2010.
Our search yielded 779 papers, of which 23 papers were selected for a detailed
analysis following a detailed exclusion and quality assessment criteria. The
analysis of the selected papers shows that the main ICT technologies adopted
are text and voice-based services targeting mobile phones. The analysis also
shows that radios are still widely used in disseminating agriculture
information to rural farmers, while computers are mainly used by researchers.
Though the mobile-based services aimed at improving access to accurate and
timely agriculture information, the literature reviews indicate that the
adoption of the services is constrained by poor technological infrastructure,
inappropriate ICT policies and low capacity levels of users, especially
farmers, to using the technologies. The findings further indicate that
literature on an appropriate theoretical framework for guiding ICT innovations
is lacking.

coronae models are calculated assuming the illuminating hard X-ray power-law,
gas density, Thomson depth and coronal heating strength vary in response to
changes in the accretion rate. We identify models that produce warm coronae
with temperatures between $0.3$ and $1.1$ keV, and measure the photon indices
and emitted fluxes in the $0.5$-$2$ keV and $2$-$10$ keV bands. Correlations
and anti-correlations between these quantities depend on the evolution and
structure of the warm corona. Tracing the path that an AGN follows through
these correlations will constrain how warm coronae are heated and connected to
the accretion disc. Variations in the density structure and coronal heating
strength of warm coronae will lead to a variety of soft excess strengths and

that produces a stronger soft excess, consistent with observations of local
Seyfert galaxies.

taking advantage of a proper subdivision between a computationally expensive

Asynchronous methods do not require all processors to maintain a consistent
view of the optimization variables. Consequently, they generally can make more
efficient use of computational resources than synchronous methods, and they are
not sensitive to issues like stragglers (i.e., slow nodes) and unreliable
communication links. Mathematical modeling of asynchronous methods involves
proper accounting of information delays, which makes their analysis
challenging. This article reviews recent developments in the design and
analysis of asynchronous optimization methods, covering both centralized
methods, where all processors update a master copy of the optimization
variables, and decentralized methods, where each processor maintains a local
copy of the variables. The analysis provides insights as to how the degree of
asynchrony impacts convergence rates, especially in stochastic optimization
methods.

spatio-temporal essence from consecutive 3D point cloud frames. Specifically,
our DeepTracking-Net starts with optimizing a randomly initialized latent TCD.
The TCD is then decoded to regress a continuous flow (i.e. a displacement
vector field) which assigns a motion vector to every point of time-varying 3D

the minimization of an unsupervised alignment loss. Experiments on both

uncertain directions, yet little is known about the nature of policy response.
Here we take the coronavirus pandemic as a global and extraordinarily
consequential case, and study the global policy response by analyzing a novel
dataset recording policy documents published by government agencies, think
tanks, and intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) across 114 countries (37,725
policy documents from Jan 2nd through May 26th 2020). Our analyses reveal four
primary findings. (1) Global policy attention to COVID-19 follows a remarkably
similar trajectory as the total confirmed cases of COVID-19, yet with evolving
policy focus from public health to broader social issues. (2) The COVID-19
policy frontier disproportionately draws on the latest, peer-reviewed, and
high-impact scientific insights. Moreover, policy documents that cite science
appear especially impactful within the policy domain. (3) The global policy
frontier is primarily interconnected through IGOs, such as the WHO, which
produce policy documents that are central to the COVID19 policy network and
draw especially strongly on scientific literature. Removing IGOs' contributions
fundamentally alters the global policy landscape, with the policy citation
network among government agencies increasingly fragmented into many isolated
clusters. (4) Countries exhibit highly heterogeneous policy attention to
COVID-19. Most strikingly, a country's early policy attention to COVID-19 shows
a surprising degree of predictability for the country's subsequent deaths.
Overall, these results uncover fundamental patterns of policy interactions and,
given the consequential nature of emergent threats and the paucity of
quantitative approaches to understand them, open up novel dimensions for
assessing and effectively coordinating global and local responses to COVID-19
and beyond.

networks via affecting the expressivity power and the learning dynamics.
Learning-based activation functions have recently gained increasing attention
and success. We propose a new perspective of learnable activation function
through formulating them with element-wise attention mechanism. In each network
layer, we devise an attention module which learns an element-wise, sign-based
attention map for the pre-activation feature map. The attention map scales an
element based on its sign. Adding the attention module with a rectified linear
unit (ReLU) results in an amplification of positive elements and a suppression
of negative ones, both with learned, data-adaptive parameters. We coin the
resulting activation function Attention-based Rectified Linear Unit (AReLU).
The attention module essentially learns an element-wise residue of the
activated part of the input, as ReLU can be viewed as an identity
transformation. This makes the network training more resistant to gradient
vanishing. The learned attentive activation leads to well-focused activation of
relevant regions of a feature map. Through extensive evaluations, we show that
AReLU significantly boosts the performance of most mainstream network
architectures with only two extra learnable parameters per layer introduced.
Notably, AReLU facilitates fast network training under small learning rates,
which makes it especially suited in the case of transfer learning and meta
learning. Our source code has been released (see
https://github.com/densechen/AReLU).

data integration since these models can seamlessly express dependencies between
mixed variable types (binary, continuous, zero-inflated) via latent Gaussian
correlations. The estimation of these latent correlations, however, comes at
considerable computational cost, having prevented the routine use of these
models on high-dimensional data. Here, we propose a new computational approach
for estimating latent correlations via a hybrid multi-linear interpolation and
optimization scheme. Our approach speeds up the current state of the art
computation by several orders of magnitude, thus allowing fast computation of
latent Gaussian copula models even when the number of variables $p$ is large.
We provide theoretical guarantees for the approximation error of our numerical
scheme and support its excellent performance on simulated and real-world data.
We illustrate the practical advantages of our method on high-dimensional sparse
quantitative and relative abundance microbiome data as well as multi-view data
from The Cancer Genome Atlas Project. Our method is implemented in the R

were predicted to exist more than ten years ago from the reaction of the Milky

appear slightly younger than their phase-space surroundings, arguing against an
extra-galactic origin. We also identify in relative age many of the classical
ridges in the plane of azimuthal velocity vs. Galactocentric radius,
traditionally associated with resonance features. These ridges are also younger

remarkably, qualitatively reproduces the trends seen in the data. Our results
re-inforce the idea that the Galactic disc is currently being shaped by both

has, in turn, led to the popularity of on-premise and cloud-hosted deep
learning platforms, whose goals are to enable organizations utilize expensive
resources effectively, and to share said resources among multiple teams in a
fair and effective manner.
  In this paper, we examine the elastic scaling of Deep Learning (DL) jobs over
large-scale training platforms and propose a novel resource allocation strategy
for DL training jobs, resulting in improved job run time performance as well as
increased cluster utilization. We begin by analyzing DL workloads and exploit
the fact that DL jobs can be run with a range of batch sizes without affecting
their final accuracy. We formulate an optimization problem that explores a
dynamic batch size allocation to individual DL jobs based on their scaling
efficiency, when running on multiple nodes. We design a fast dynamic
programming based optimizer to solve this problem in real-time to determine
jobs that can be scaled up/down, and use this optimizer in an autoscaler to
dynamically change the allocated resources and batch sizes of individual DL
jobs.
  We demonstrate empirically that our elastic scaling algorithm can complete up
to $\approx 2 \times$ as many jobs as compared to a strong baseline algorithm
that also scales the number of GPUs but does not change the batch size. We also
demonstrate that the average completion time with our algorithm is up to
$\approx 10 \times$ faster than that of the baseline.

spot these by mere visual inspection. Motivated by this challenging problem in
brain signal analysis, we propose a detection and testing procedure to find the

cumulative sum statistics (CUSUM). The classical testing procedure for
functional data depends on a null distribution which depends on infinitely many
unknown parameters, though in practice only a finite number of these can be
included for the hypothesis test of the existence of change point. This paper
provides some theoretical insights on the influence of the number of

supercritical showing its tendency of fragmentation, which is further confirmed
by the detection of a periodic oscillatory pattern (having a period of ~3-4 pc)
in the velocity profile of 13CO. Our outcomes suggest that the fragments
distributed toward the filament ends have rapidly collapsed, and had formed the
known star-forming sites. Overall, the elongated filament in Mon R1 is a

a theoretical model for this phenomenon and, with the aid of DFT calculations,
apply it to the case of a dihydropyrene-type photochromic molecular donor. By

optimized for the learned reward. However, this method cannot distinguish
between the learned reward function failing to reflect user preferences and the

this method can only tell us about behavior in the evaluation environment, but
the reward may incentivize very different behavior in even a slightly different

Equivalent-Policy Invariant Comparison (EPIC) distance to quantify the

multi-path architectures restrict the quadratic increment of complexity to a
linear scale. However, existing multi-column/path networks or model ensembling
methods do not consider any feature-dependent allocation of parallel resources,
and therefore, tend to learn redundant features. Given a layer in a multi-path
network, if we restrict each path to learn a context-specific set of features
and introduce a mechanism to intelligently allocate incoming feature maps to
such paths, each path can specialize in a certain context, reducing the
redundancy and improving the quality of extracted features. This eventually
leads to better-optimized usage of parallel resources. To do this, we propose
inserting feature-dependent cross-connections between parallel sets of feature
maps in successive layers. The weighting coefficients of these
cross-connections are computed from the input features of the particular layer.
Our multi-path networks show improved image recognition accuracy at a similar
complexity compared to conventional and state-of-the-art methods for deepening,
widening and adaptive feature extracting, in both small and large scale

mitigation in tracking control systems. Our proposed scheme, referred to as the
Reference Governor with Dynamic Constraint (RG-DC), recasts the overshoot
mitigation problem as a constraint management problem. The outcome of this
reformulation is a dynamic Maximal Admissible Set (MAS), which varies in
real-time as a function of the reference signal and the tracking output. The
RG-DC employs the dynamic MAS to modify the reference signal to mitigate or, if
possible, prevent overshoot. We present several properties of the dynamic MAS
and the algorithms required to compute it. We also investigate the stability
and recursive feasibility of the RG-DC, and present an interesting property of
RG-DC regarding its effect on the governed system's frequency response.
Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, and also highlight
its limitations. This paper serves as an extension of our earlier paper on this

Currently Under Review",,,"MIT Center for Brains, Minds and Machines (CBMM) Memo #109","cs.LG eess.IV q-bio.NC stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  The main success stories of deep learning, starting with ImageNet, depend on
deep convolutional networks, which on certain tasks perform significantly
better than traditional shallow classifiers, such as support vector machines,
and also better than deep fully connected networks; but what is so special
about deep convolutional networks? Recent results in approximation theory
proved an exponential advantage of deep convolutional networks with or without
shared weights in approximating functions with hierarchical locality in their
compositional structure. More recently, the hierarchical structure was proved
to be hard to learn from data, suggesting that it is a powerful prior embedded
in the architecture of the network. These mathematical results, however, do not
say which real-life tasks correspond to input-output functions with
hierarchical locality. To evaluate this, we consider a set of visual tasks
where we disrupt the local organization of images via ""deterministic
scrambling"" to later perform a visual task on these images structurally-altered
in the same way for training and testing. For object recognition we find, as
expected, that scrambling does not affect the performance of shallow or deep
fully connected networks contrary to the out-performance of convolutional
networks. Not all tasks involving images are however affected. Texture
perception and global color estimation are much less sensitive to deterministic
scrambling showing that the underlying functions corresponding to these tasks
are not hierarchically local; and also counter-intuitively showing that these
tasks are better approximated by networks that are not deep (texture) nor
convolutional (color). Altogether, these results shed light into the importance
of matching a network architecture with its embedded prior of the task to be
learned.

modifying the reward function. This modified reward function is simple to
estimate by learning auxiliary classifiers that distinguish source-domain

function penalizes the agent for visiting states and taking actions in the
source domain which are not possible in the target domain. Said another way,
the agent is penalized for transitions that would indicate that the agent is
interacting with the source domain, rather than the target domain. Our approach
is applicable to domains with continuous states and actions and does not

result to real stable polynomials. We will prove that assuming mild conditions

logarithmic star formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass ($M_*$) relation, called
the main sequence of star-forming galaxies (MS), for galaxies out to $z\sim5$.
We measure the MS using mean stacks of 3 GHz radio continuum images to derive
average SFRs for $\sim$200,000 mass-selected galaxies at $z>0.3$ in the COSMOS
field. We describe the MS relation adopting a new model that incorporates a
linear relation at low stellar mass (log($M_*$/M$_\odot$)$<$10) and a
flattening at high stellar mass that becomes more prominent at low redshift
($z<1.5$). We find that the SFR density peaks at $1.5<z<2$ and at each epoch
there is a characteristic stellar mass ($M_* = 1 - 4 \times
10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot$) that contributes the most to the overall SFR density.
This characteristic mass increases with redshift, at least to $z\sim2.5$. We
find no significant evidence for variations in the MS relation for galaxies in
different environments traced by the galaxy number density at $0.3<z<3$, nor
for galaxies in X-ray groups at $z\sim0.75$. We confirm that massive
bulge-dominated galaxies have lower SFRs than disk-dominated galaxies at a
fixed stellar mass at $z<1.2$. As a consequence, the increase in
bulge-dominated galaxies in the local star-forming population leads to a
flattening of the MS at high stellar masses. This indicates that
""mass-quenching"" is linked with changes in the morphological composition of
galaxies at a fixed stellar mass.

is the paradigmatic example of topology induced by an applied magnetic field.
Conventionally, the Hofstadter problem involves adding $\sim 10^4$ T magnetic
fields to a trivial band structure. In this work, we show that when a magnetic
field is added to an initially topological band structure, a wealth of
remarkable possible phases emerges. Remarkably, we find topological phases
which cannot be realized in any crystalline insulators. We prove that threading
magnetic flux through a Hamiltonian with nonzero Chern number enforces a phase
transition at fixed filling and that a 2D Hamiltonian with nontrivial Kane-Mele
invariant produces a 3D TI or 3D weak TI phase in periodic flux. We then study
fragile topology protected by the product of two-fold rotation and
time-reversal and show that there exists a 3D higher order TI phase where
corner modes are pumped by flux. We show that a model of twisted bilayer
graphene realizes this phase. Our results rely primarily on the magnetic
translation group which exists at rational values of the flux. The advent of
Moir\'e lattices also renders our work relevant experimentally. In Moir\'e
lattices, it is possible for fields of order $1-30$ T to reach one flux per
plaquette and allow access to our proposed Hofstadter topological phase.

result of thermal instability triggered by these perturbations. The ratio of
cooling to free-fall timescales $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ in the hot component
of the CGM spans a wide range $\sim 1-100$ at a given radius, but exhibits
approximately constant median values $\sim 5-20$ at all radii $0.1 R_{\rm vir}

adopted as the thermal instability threshold in ``precipitation'' models of the

constant $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm ff}$ and hydrostatic equilibrium approximately
reproduces the number density and entropy profiles of each simulation, but only
if it assumes the metallicity profile and temperature boundary condition taken
directly from the simulation. We explicitly show that the $t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm

An important component of this process is the exploration of data in search of

Among all trends existing in the natural world, one-dimensional trends, often
called sequences, are of particular interest as they provide insights into
simple phenomena. However, some are challenging to detect as they may be
expressed in complex manners. We present the Sequencer, an algorithm designed
to generically identify the main trend in a dataset. It does so by constructing
graphs describing the similarities between pairs of observations, computed with
a set of metrics and scales. Using the fact that continuous trends lead to more
elongated graphs, the algorithm can identify which aspects of the data are
relevant in establishing a global sequence. Such an approach can be used beyond
the proposed algorithm and can optimize the parameters of any dimensionality
reduction technique. We demonstrate the power of the Sequencer using real-world
data from astronomy, geology as well as images from the natural world. We show
that, in a number of cases, it outperforms the popular t-SNE and UMAP
dimensionality reduction techniques. This approach to exploratory data
analysis, which does not rely on training nor tuning of any parameter, has the
potential to enable discoveries in a wide range of scientific domains. The

pair size diverges exponentially, i.e. Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) pairing
requiring huge systems to bring out the pair-only nature of the superfluid.
This crucial property is largely overlooked in many studies, thereby
misinterpreting the origin and nature of the superfluid. We compare and
contrast this with the repulsive case and show that the behavior is very
different, contradicting previous claims about drag superfluidity and the

Type Ic supernova, SN2020oi, in M100, a grand design spiral galaxy at a mere
distance of $14$ Mpc. We followed up with observations at radio, X-ray and
optical wavelengths from only a few days to several months after explosion. The
optical behaviour of the supernova is similar to those of other normal Type Ic
supernovae. The event was not detected in the X-ray band but our radio
observation revealed a bright mJy source ($L_{\nu} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{27}
{\rm erg\,s}^{-1} {\rm Hz}^{-1}$). Given, the relatively small number of
stripped envelope SNe for which radio emission is detectable, we used this
opportunity to perform a detailed analysis of the comprehensive radio dataset
we obtained. The radio emitting electrons initially experience a phase of
inverse Compton cooling which leads to steepening of the spectral index of the
radio emission. Our analysis of the cooling frequency points to a large
deviation from equipartition at the level of $\epsilon_e/\epsilon_B \gtrsim
200$, similar to a few other cases of stripped envelope SNe. Our modeling of
the radio data suggests that the shockwave driven by the SN ejecta into the
circumstellar matter (CSM) is moving at $\sim 3\times 10^{4}\,{\rm
km\,s}^{-1}$. Assuming a constant mass-loss from the stellar progenitor, we
find that the mass-loss rate is $\dot{M} \approx 1.4\times
10^{-4}\,{M}_{\odot}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$, for an assumed wind velocity of
$1000\,{\rm km\,s}^{-1}$. The temporal evolution of the radio emission suggests
a radial CSM density structure steeper than the standard $r^{-2}$.

our models around the spherical Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profile after
describing it as a Gaussian mixture, which leads to almost fully analytical
expressions for the `tidal anisotropy' scalar $\alpha(<4R_{\rm vir})$ extracted
from the tidal tensor. Our axisymmetric examples include (i) a spherical halo
at the axis of a cylindrical filament, (ii) an off-centred satellite in a
spherical host halo and (iii) an axisymmetric halo. Using these, we demonstrate
several interesting results. For example, the tidal tensor at the axis of a
pure cylindrical filament gives $\alpha^{\rm (fil)}(<R)=1/2$ exactly, for any
$R$. Also, $\alpha(<4R_{\rm vir,sat})$ for a satellite of radius $R_{\rm
vir,sat}$ as a function of its host-centric distance is a sensitive probe of
dynamical mass loss of the satellite in its host environment. Finally, we

X-ray emission at $\simeq$ 3.5 keV in astrophysical systems. One interpretation
of this excess is the decay of sterile neutrino dark matter. The most
influential study to date analysed 73 clusters observed by the XMM-Newton
satellite. We explore evidence for a $\simeq$ 3.5 keV excess in the XMM-PN
spectra of 117 redMaPPer galaxy clusters ($0.1 < z < 0.6$). In our analysis of
individual spectra, we identify three systems with an excess of flux at
$\simeq$ 3.5 keV. In one case (XCS J0003.3+0204) this excess may result from a
discrete emission line. None of these systems are the most dark matter
dominated in our sample. We group the remaining 114 clusters into four
temperature ($T_{\rm X}$) bins to search for an increase in $\simeq$ 3.5 keV
flux excess with $T_{\rm X}$ - a reliable tracer of halo mass. However, we do
not find evidence of a significant excess in flux at $\simeq$ 3.5 keV in any
$T_{\rm X}$ bins. To maximise sensitivity to a potentially weak dark matter
decay feature at $\simeq$ 3.5 keV, we jointly fit 114 clusters. Again, no
significant excess is found at $\simeq$ 3.5 keV. We estimate the upper limit of
an undetected emission line at $\simeq$ 3.5 keV to be $2.41 \times 10^{-6}$
photons cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a mixing angle of
$\sin^2(2\theta)=4.4 \times 10^{-11}$, lower than previous estimates from
cluster studies. We conclude that a flux excess at $\simeq$ 3.5 keV is not a
ubiquitous feature in clusters and therefore unlikely to originate from sterile
neutrino dark matter decay.

multiple systems. However, the effect of multiplicity is not sufficiently
understood, resulting in a plethora of uncertainties about the end stages of
massive-star evolution. In order to investigate these uncertainties, it is
useful to study massive stars just before their demise. Classical Wolf-Rayet
stars represent the final end stages of stars at the upper-mass end. The
multiplicity fraction of these stars was reported to be ${\sim}0.4$ in the
Galaxy but no correction for observational biases has been attempted.
  The aim of this study is to conduct a homogeneous radial-velocity survey of a
magnitude-limited ($V$ $\leq 12$) sample of Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars to derive
their bias-corrected multiplicity properties. The present paper focuses on 12
northern Galactic carbon-rich (WC) Wolf-Rayet stars observable with the 1.2m
Mercator telescope on the island of La Palma.
  We homogeneously measured relative radial velocities (RVs) for carbon-rich
Wolf-Rayet stars using cross-correlation. Variations in the derived RVs were
used to flag binary candidates. We investigated probable orbital configurations
and provide a first correction of observational biases through Monte-Carlo
simulations.
  Of the 12 northern Galactic WC stars in our sample, seven show peak-to-peak
RV variations larger than 10 km s$^{-1}$, which we adopt as our detection
threshold. This results in an observed spectroscopic multiplicity fraction of
0.58 with a binomial error of 0.14. In our campaign, we find a clear lack of
short-period (P~$<~\sim$100\,d), indicating that a large number of Galactic WC
binaries likely reside in long-period systems. Finally, our simulations show
that at the 10% significance level, the intrinsic multiplicity fraction of the
Galactic WC population is at least 0.72.

measurements of $H_0$, can be alleviated by ultralight scalar fields in the
early universe, and we assess its plausibility within UV physics. Since their
energy density needs to rapidly redshift away, we explore decays to massless
fields around the era of matter-radiation equality. We highlight a concrete
implementation of ultralight pseudo-scalars, axions, that decay to an abelian
dark sector. This scenario circumvents major problems of other popular
realizations of early universe scalar models in that it uses a regular scalar
potential that is quadratic around the minimum, instead of the extreme
fine-tuning of many existing models. The idea is that the scalar is initially
frozen in its potential until $H\sim m$, then efficient energy transfer from
the scalar to the massless field can occur shortly after the beginning of
oscillations due to resonance. We introduce an effective fluid model which
captures the transition from the frozen scalar phase to the radiation dark
sector phase. We perform a fit to a combined Planck 2018, BAO, SH$_0$ES and
Pantheon supernovae dataset and find that the model gives
$H_0=69.9_{-0.86}^{+0.84}$ km/s/Mpc with $\Delta\chi^2 \approx -9$ compared to
$\Lambda$CDM; while inclusions of other data sets may worsen the fit.
Importantly, we find that large values of the coupling between fields is
required for sufficiently rapid decay: For axion-gauge field models $\phi
F\tilde{F}/\Lambda$ it requires $\Lambda\lesssim f/80$, where $2\pi f$ is the
field range. We find related conclusions for scalar-scalar models
$\sim\phi\,\chi^2$ and for models that utilize perturbative decays. We conclude
that these sorts of ultralight scalar models that purport to alleviate the
Hubble tension, while being reasonable effective field theories, require
features that are difficult to embed within UV physics.

the Hill radius for a given planetary mass increases with larger semi-major

planets in the HZ than late-type stars. In general, dynamical constraints allow
$\sim$6 HZ Earth-mass planets for stellar masses $\gtrsim 0.7 M_\odot$,
depending on the presence of farther out giant planets. As an example, we
consider the case of Beta CVn, a nearby bright solar-type star. We present 20
years of radial velocities (RV) from the Keck/HIRES and APF instruments and
conduct an injection-recovery analysis of planetary signatures in the data. Our
analysis of these RV data rule out planets more massive than Saturn within
10~AU of the star. These system properties are used to calculate the potential

distribution of the accelerated particles. The apparent inconsistency of the
prompt emission spectra with the synchrotron radiation scenario has resulted in
considering more complex models. The inclusion of the soft X-ray data (down to
0.5 keV) in GRB spectra have led to the discovery of low-energy breaks in their
spectra. More importantly, the distribution of spectral slopes has been shifted
towards the prediction of the synchrotron radiation scenario if the break is
associated with the synchrotron cooling frequency. We discuss the recent study
that systematically extend the range of investigation down to the optical
domain. It was shown that the optical-to-gamma-rays spectra are consistent with
the synchrotron model. In addition, widely used empirical model made of thermal
and non-thermal components has been tested. We conclude that most of the

presence/absence of the contaminating afterglow emission. We comment on the

invoke energy injection into the external shock, requiring long-lasting
activity of the central engine of GRBs. We discuss a new alternative,
comprehensive model: the plateau phase originates from the high latitude
emission (i.e., the radiation observed from larger angles relative to the line
of sight, after the prompt emission from a curved surface is switched off) when
the jet exhibits bulk motion and intensity structure. This model enables us to

processes. X-ray Free Electron Lasers (XFELs) deliver femtosecond, narrow
bandwidth ($\frac{\Delta E}{E} < 0.5\%$) pulses containing $\sim 10^{10}$
photons. However, the energy contained in each pulse fluctuates thus
complicating pulse by pulse efforts to quantify the number of photons.
Improvements in counting the photons in each pulse have defined the state of
the art for XAS sensitivity. Here we demonstrate a final step in these
improvements through a balanced detection method that approaches the photon
counting shot noise limit. In doing so, we obtain high quality absorption
spectra from the insulator-metal transition in VO$_2$ and unlock a method to
explore dilute systems, subtle processes and nonlinear phenomena with ultrafast
x-rays. The method is especially beneficial for x-ray light sources where
integration and averaging are not viable options to improve sensitivity.

explore the conditions to adapt this measurement technique to c-Ge substrates.
Based on PC-1D simulations, we deduce that a minimum effective lifetime is
needed corresponding to an effective diffusion length equal to the substrate
thickness. Apart from this, an accurate estimation of the total photogeneration
inside the c-Ge sample is also mandatory. This condition implies that the light
intensity that impinges onto the sample must be measured with a c-Ge sensor,
although the integrated c-Si sensor can be used for high flash intensities.
Additionally, the optical factor used to evaluate sample reflectance must be
also known, which is determined by measuring robust effective lifetime values
under photoconductance decay conditions. Finally, knowledge about carrier
mobility in c-Ge is also necessary to translate the measured photoconductance
to the corresponding excess carrier density values. Lifetime measurements of
passivated c-Ge substrates done by QSS-PC technique are validated by comparing
them with the ones obtained by microwave photoconductance technique.

quasi-static, virial-temperature gas phase in the circumgalactic medium (CGM)
at redshifts 0<z<5, and how the formation of this virialized phase affects the
evolution of galactic discs. We demonstrate that when the halo mass crosses
~10^12 M_sun, the cooling time of shocked gas in the inner CGM (~0.1 R_vir,
where R_vir is the virial radius) exceeds the local free-fall time. The inner
CGM then experiences a transition from on average sub-virial temperatures
(T<<T_vir), large pressure fluctuations and supersonic inflow/outflow
velocities, to virial temperatures (T~T_vir), uniform pressures and subsonic
velocities. This transition occurs when the outer CGM (~0.5 R_vir) is already
subsonic and has a temperature ~T_vir, indicating that the longer cooling times
at large radii allow the outer CGM to virialize at lower halo masses than the
inner CGM. This outside-in CGM virialization scenario is in contrast with
inside-out scenarios commonly envisioned based on more idealized simulations.
We demonstrate that inner CGM virialization coincides with abrupt changes in
the central galaxy and its stellar feedback: the galaxy settles into a stable
rotating disc, star formation transitions from `bursty' to `steady,' and
stellar-driven galaxy-scale outflows are suppressed. Our results thus suggest
that CGM virialization is initially associated with the formation of
rotation-dominated thin galactic discs, rather than with the quenching of star
formation as often assumed.

depends on the surface magnetic field. Using power-law scaling relations
between different physical parameters, we build an analytical model to connect
the observed X-ray emission to the magnetic flux. The basis for our model are
the scaling laws of Rosner, Tucker \& Vaiana (RTV) that connect the temperature
and pressure of a coronal loop to its length and energy input. To estimate the
energy flux into the upper atmosphere, we use scalings derived for different
heating mechanisms, e.g. for field-line braiding or Alfven-wave heating. We
supplement this by observed relations between active region size and magnetic
flux and derive scalings of how X-ray emissivity depends on temperature. Based
on our analytical model, we find a power-law dependence of the X-ray emission
on the magnetic flux, $L_{\rm X}\propto \Phi^m$, with a power-law index $m$
being in the range from about 1 to 2. This finding is consistent with a wide
range of observations, from individual features on the Sun, e.g. bright points
or active regions, to stars of different types and varying levels of activity.
The power-law index $m$ depends on the choice of the heating mechanism, and our
results slightly favour the braiding and nanoflare scenarios over Alfv\'en wave
heating. In addition, the choice of instrument will have an impact on the
power-law index $m$, which is because of the sensitivity of the observed
wavelength region to the temperature of the coronal plasma. Overall, our simple
analytical model based on the RTV scaling laws gives a good representation of
the observed X-ray emission. This underlines that we might be able to
understand stellar coronal activity though a collection of basic building
blocks, i.e. loops, that we can study in spatially resolved detail on the Sun.

large-scale systems assumes homogeneous servers; unfortunately, policies that
perform well in the homogeneous setting can cause unacceptably poor
performance---or even instability---in heterogeneous systems.
  We adapt the ""power-of-d"" versions of both the Join-the-Idle-Queue and
Join-the-Shortest-Queue policies to design two corresponding families of
heterogeneity-aware dispatching policies, each of which is parameterized by a
pair of routing probabilities. Unlike their heterogeneity-unaware counterparts,
our policies use server speed information both when choosing which servers to
query and when probabilistically deciding where (among the queried servers) to
dispatch jobs. Both of our policy families are analytically tractable: our mean
response time and queue length distribution analyses are exact as the number of
servers approaches infinity, under standard assumptions. Furthermore, our
policy families achieve maximal stability and outperform well-known dispatching
rules---including heterogeneity-aware policies such as
Shortest-Expected-Delay---with respect to mean response time.

required to achieve good voltage controls, but this is difficult to obtain in

with unbalanced three-phase scenarios. The key idea is to learn a surrogate
model to capture the relationship between the power injections and voltage
fluctuation of each node from historical data instead of using the original
inaccurate model affected by errors and uncertainties. This allows us to
integrate the DRL with the learned surrogate model. In particular, DRL is
applied to learn the optimal control strategy from the experiences obtained by
continuous interactions with the surrogate model. The integrated framework
contains training three networks, i.e., surrogate model, actor, and critic
networks, which fully leverage the strong nonlinear fitting ability of deep
learning and DRL for online decision making. Several single-phase approaches
have also been extended to deal with three-phase unbalance scenarios and the
simulation results on the IEEE 123-bus system show that our proposed method can
achieve similar performance as those that use accurate physical models.

regularities and conserved magnitudes, the last decades in Particle Physics
have seen the identification of symmetries, and their well defined breaking, as
the guiding principle for the elementary constituents of matter and their
interactions. Flavour SU(3) symmetry of hadrons led to the Quark Model and the
antisymmetry requirement under exchange of identical fermions led to the colour
degree of freedom, the charge for the interactions of quarks and gluons in the
SU(3) local gauge symmetry. Parity Violation in weak interactions led to
consider the Chiral Fields with definite transformation properties under the
weak isospin gauge group of the ElectroWeak SU(2)xU(1) Symmetry, which
predicted novel weak neutral current interactions. CP-Violation led to three
families of quarks opening the field of Flavour Physics.
Time-Reversal-Violation has been observed with Entangled neutral mesons,
compatible with CPT-invariance. The cancellation of gauge anomalies leads to
Quark-Lepton Symmetry. Neutrinos were postulated to save energy and angular
momentum conservation in beta decay. The discovery of neutrino oscillations led
to a new era about their origin of mass, mixing, discrete symmetries and the
global lepton-number violation. Leptogenesis may be the source of the
matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. The discovery of quarks and
leptons and the mediators of their interactions, with observables in
spectacular agreement with this Standard Theory, is the triumph of Symmetries.
Gauge symmetry is exact only when the particles are massless. One needs a
subtle breaking of the symmetry, providing the Origin of Mass, without
affecting the interactions: the Brout-Englert-Higgs Mechanism which produces
the Higgs Boson as a remnant. Open present problems are addressed with the
search of New Physics Beyond-the-Standard-Model.

integration, low-discrepancy sampling and code coupling for Lagrangian and
Eulerian Vlasov-Poisson solvers. Low-discrepancy sequences, also called
quasi-random sequences (Quasi Monte Carlo), provide convergence rates close to
$\mathcal{O}( N^{-1})$ which are far superior to (pseudo) random numbers (Monte
Carlo) settling in at only $\mathcal{O}(N^{-0.5})$. Lagrangian particle methods
such as PIC rely on Monte Carlo integration. The particle distributions are
nonlinearly perturbed by the forward flow following the characteristics. Hence
it remains the question of whether particle methods can benefit from such
quasi-random-sequences. Any nonlinear measure-preserving map does not affect
the low-discrepancy of a QMC sequence such that the order of convergence
remains. This article shows that the forward flow of phase space-conserving
geometric particle methods induces naturally such a measure-preserving map
underlying their importance in a new framework. In this context the Hardy
Krause Variation is observed to increase in the Vlasov-Poisson system for the
first time. with the linear phase. Also the star discrepancy is presented for
an entire PIC simulation. On the other hand, Eulerian and Lagrangian solvers
have different strengths and weaknesses, such that we present a novel way of
transiting from a spectral discretization of the Vlasov--Poisson system to a
PIC simulation. This is achieved by higher dimensional inverse transform
sampling (Rosenblatt-M\""uck transform). In this way Markov Chain Monte Carlo
techniques are circumvented which allows the use of pseudo and quasi-random
numbers. In the latter case better convergence rates can be observed both in
the linear and nonlinear phase.

version of the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE)
theory. ECNLE theory describes activated relaxation as a coupled local-nonlocal
event involving local caging and longer range collective elasticity, with the
latter becoming more important with increasing packing fraction. The central
new question is how this physical picture, and the relative importance of
caging versus elasticity physics, depends on external stress, strain and shear
rate. Theoretical predictions are presented for deformation induced enhancement
of mobility, onset of relaxation speed up at remarkably low values of stress,
strain or dimensionless shear rate, thinning of the structural relaxation time
and viscosity with apparent power law exponents, a non-vanishing activation
barrier in the shear thinning regime, a Herschel-Bulkley form of rate
dependence of the steady state shear stress, exponential growth of dynamic
yield stresses with packing fraction, and reduced dynamic fragility and
heterogeneity under deformation. The results are contrasted with experiments
and simulations, and qualitative or better agreement is found. An overarching
conclusion is that deformation strongly reduces the importance of longer range
collective elastic effects for most, but not all, physical questions, with
stress-dependent dynamic heterogeneity phenomena being qualitatively sensitive
to collective elasticity. Overall, nonlinear rheology is a more local cage

expected execution cost of probabilistic programs. The analysis is naturally
compositional, parametric in the cost model, and supports higher order
functions and inductive data types. The derived bounds are multivariate
polynomials that are functions of data structures. Bound inference is enabled
by local type rules that reduce type inference to linear constraint solving.
The type system is based on the potential method of amortized analysis and
extends automatic amortized resource analysis (AARA) for deterministic
programs. A main innovation is that bounds can contain symbolic probabilities,
which may appear in data structures and function arguments. Another
contribution is a novel soundness proof that establishes the correctness of the
derived bounds with respect to a distribution-based operational cost semantics
that also includes nontrivial diverging behavior. For cost models like time,
derived bounds imply termination with probability one. To highlight the novel
ideas, the presentation focuses on linear potential and a core language.
However, the analysis is implemented as an extension of Resource Aware ML and
supports polynomial bounds and user defined data structures. The effectiveness
of the technique is evaluated by analyzing the sample complexity of discrete
distributions and with a novel average-case estimation for deterministic
programs that combines expected cost analysis with statistical methods.

nearest-oscillator interactions and the on-site (pinned) Klein-Gordon (KG)
quartic self-interaction. Assuming weak nonlinearity, we introduce a stochastic
influence action approach to the problem and obtain the energy flow in
different junctures of the chain. The formal results obtained here can be used
for quantum transport problems in weakly nonlinear quantum systems. For
$\alpha$-type anharmonicity, we observe that the first-order corrections do not
play any role in the thermal transport in the NESS of the configuration we
considered. For KG and $\beta$-types anharmonicity, we work out explicitly the
case of two weakly nonlinearly coupled oscillators, with results scalable to
any number of oscillators. We examine the late-time energy flows from one
thermal bath to the other via the coupled oscillators, and show that both the
zeroth- and the first-order contributions of the energy flow become constant in
time at late times, signaling the existence of a late-time NESS to first order
in nonlinearity. Our perturbative calculations provide a measure of the
strength of nonlinearity for nonlinear open quantum systems, which may help
control the mesoscopic heat transport distinct from or close to linear
transport. Furthermore, our results also give a benchmark for the numerical
challenge of simulating heat transport. Our setup and predictions can be

numerous extensions of the correspondence up to early 2020. This is an extended
writeup of the lectures given at the Winter School YRISW 2020, to appear in a
special issue of JPhysA.
  Class S is a wide class of 4d $N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories (ranging
from super-QCD to non-Lagrangian theories) obtained by twisted compactification
of 6d $N=(2,0)$ superconformal theories on a Riemann surface. This 6d
construction yields the Coulomb branch and Seiberg-Witten geometry of class S
theories, geometrizes S-duality, and leads to the AGT correspondence, which
states that many observables of class S theories are equal to 2d CFT
correlators. For instance, the four-sphere partition function of a 4d $N=2$
SU(2) superconformal quiver theory is equal to a Liouville CFT correlator of
primary operators.
  Extensions of the AGT correspondence abound: asymptotically-free gauge
theories and Argyres-Douglas theories correspond to irregular CFT operators,
quivers with higher-rank gauge groups and non-Lagrangian tinkertoys such as
$T_N$ correspond to Toda CFT correlators, and nonlocal operators (Wilson-'t
Hooft loops, surface operators, domain walls) correspond to Verlinde networks,
degenerate primary operators, braiding and fusion kernels, and Riemann surfaces
with boundaries.

subpopulation attacks have the advantage of inducing misclassification in
naturally distributed data points at inference time, making the attacks
extremely stealthy. We also show that our attack strategy can be used to

subpopulation attacks are impossible to defend against, and empirically
demonstrate the limitations of existing defenses against our attacks,

properties of rubble-pile small bodies can be modified, and some may
catastrophically break up. This phenomenon is of particular interest for
understanding the evolution and population of small bodies, and for making
predictions for future encounters. Previous numerical explorations typically
used methods that do not adequately represent the nature of rubble piles. The
encounter outcomes and influence factors are still poorly constrained. Based on
recent advances in modeling rubble piles, we aim to provide a better
understanding of the tidal encounter processes through soft-sphere discrete
element modeling (SSDEM) and to establish a database of encounter outcomes and
the dependencies on encounter conditions and rubble-pile properties. We
performed thousands of numerical simulations using the SSDEM implemented in the
N-body code pkdgrav to study the dynamical evolution of rubble piles during
close encounters with the Earth. The effects of encounter conditions, material
strength, arrangement, and resolution of constituent particles are explored.
Three typical tidal encounter outcomes are classified, i.e., deformation, mass
shedding, and disruption, ranging from mild modifications to severe damages of
the progenitor. The encounter speed and distance required for causing
disruption events are much smaller than those predicted by previous studies,
indicating a smaller creation rate of tidally disrupted small body populations.
Extremely elongated fragments with axis ratios ~1:6 can be formed by moderate
encounters. Our analyses of the spin-shape evolution of the largest remnants
reveal reshaping mechanisms of rubble piles in response to tidal forces,
consistent with stable rubble-pile configurations derived by continuum theory.
A case study for SL9 suggests a low bulk density (0.2-0.3 g/cc) for its
progenitor.

on interpretability in models for vision and natural language processing.
First, we examine the kinds of abstractions learned by neurons. In image
classification, we find that many neurons learn highly abstract but
semantically coherent visual concepts, while other polysemantic neurons detect
multiple unrelated features; in natural language inference (NLI), neurons learn
shallow lexical heuristics from dataset biases. Second, we see whether
compositional explanations give us insight into model performance: vision
neurons that detect human-interpretable concepts are positively correlated with
task performance, while NLI neurons that fire for shallow heuristics are
negatively correlated with task performance. Finally, we show how compositional
explanations provide an accessible way for end users to produce simple
""copy-paste"" adversarial examples that change model behavior in predictable
ways.

possibilities of controller adaptation. Given an infinite-horizon cost
function, the so-called critic of RL approximates it with a neural net and
sends this information to the controller (called ""actor""). However, the issue
of closed-loop stability under an RL-method is still not fully addressed. Since
the critic delivers merely an approximation to the value function of the
corresponding infinite-horizon problem, no guarantee can be given in general as
to whether the actor's actions stabilize the system. Different approaches to
this issue exist. The current work offers a particular one, which, starting
with a (not necessarily smooth) control Lyapunov function (CLF), derives an
online RL-scheme in such a way that practical semi-global stability property of
the closed-loop can be established. The approach logically continues the work
of the authors on parameterized controllers and Lyapunov-like constraints for

Chuang (1999) motivated the development of the Clifford hierarchy. Despite its
intrinsic value for quantum computing, the widespread use of magic state
distillation, which is closely related to this model, emphasizes the importance
of comprehending the hierarchy. There is currently a limited understanding of
the structure of this hierarchy, apart from the case of diagonal unitaries (Cui
et al., 2017; Rengaswamy et al. 2019). We explore the structure of the second
and third levels of the hierarchy, the first level being the ubiquitous Pauli
group, via the Weyl (i.e., Pauli) expansion of unitaries at these levels. In
particular, we characterize the support of the standard Clifford operations on
the Pauli group. Since conjugation of a Pauli by a third level unitary produces
traceless Hermitian Cliffords, we characterize their Pauli support as well.
Semi-Clifford unitaries are known to have ancilla savings in the teleportation
model, and we explore their Pauli support via symplectic transvections.
Finally, we show that, up to multiplication by a Clifford, every third level
unitary commutes with at least one Pauli matrix. This can be used inductively
to show that, up to a multiplication by a Clifford, every third level unitary
is supported on a maximal commutative subgroup of the Pauli group.
Additionally, it can be easily seen that the latter implies the generalized
semi-Clifford conjecture, proven by Beigi and Shor (2010). We discuss potential
applications in quantum error correction and the design of flag gadgets.

submitting queries and inspecting returns. Recent work largely improves the
efficiency of those attacks, demonstrating their practicality on today's

  We propose Blacklight, a new defense against query-based black-box
adversarial attacks. The fundamental insight driving our design is that, to
compute adversarial examples, these attacks perform iterative optimization over
the network, producing image queries highly similar in the input space.
Blacklight detects query-based black-box attacks by detecting highly similar
queries, using an efficient similarity engine operating on probabilistic
content fingerprints. We evaluate Blacklight against eight state-of-the-art
attacks, across a variety of models and image classification tasks. Blacklight
identifies them all, often after only a handful of queries. By rejecting all
detected queries, Blacklight prevents any attack to complete, even when
attackers persist to submit queries after account ban or query rejection.
Blacklight is also robust against several powerful countermeasures, including
an optimal black-box attack that approximates white-box attacks in efficiency.
Finally, we illustrate how Blacklight generalizes to other domains like text

determine if this excess lay behind a cold front. In our new XMM observations
we have found that there is a sharp edge in X-ray surface brightness near the
cluster virial radius (1.7Mpc) to the west, with a width comparable to the mean
free path. The temperature measurements obtained with Suzaku data across this

these properties are consistent with this edge being the largest cold front
ever observed in a galaxy cluster. We also find a second edge to the west,
1.2Mpc from the core, which also appears to be a cold front. Our results
indicate that magnetic fields are able to stabilize the cold fronts against

jurors vote honestly for the alternative they view more likely, given their
signal and prior voting, because they are experts who want to enhance their
reputation (after their vote and actual state of Nature is revealed). For a
fixed set of jury abilities, the reliability of the verdict depends on the
voting order. For a jury of size three, the optimal ordering is always as
follows: middle ability first, then highest ability, then lowest. For
sufficiently heterogeneous juries, sequential voting is more reliable than
simultaneous voting and is in fact optimal (allowing for non-honest voting).

  Comments welcome!",,,,"math.GR math.LO","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We introduce and study Polish topologies on various spaces of countable
enumerated groups, where an enumerated group is simply a group whose underlying
set is the set of natural numbers. Using elementary tools and well known
examples from combinatorial group theory, combined with the Baire category
theorem, we obtain a plethora of results demonstrating that several phenomena
in group theory are generic. In effect, we provide a new topological framework
for the analysis of various well known problems in group theory. We also
provide a connection between genericity in these spaces, the word problem for
finitely generated groups and model-theoretic forcing. Using these connections,
we investigate the natural question: when does a certain space of enumerated
groups contain a comeager isomorphism class? We obtain a sufficient condition
that allows us to answer the question in the negative for the space of all
enumerated groups and the space of left orderable enumerated groups. We
document several open questions in connection with these considerations.

Studying the spectral evolution of the strong features we found that the
absorption features move to higher expansion velocities before disappearing and
the emission features show (different) asymmetries. Thanks to the intermediate
spectral resolution we identified and analysed the interstellar medium
absorption features present in the spectra. We detected atomic absorption
features of Na I and Ca II. The sodium D lines show more complex substructures

look for a constructive method to connect any two points in $\mathbb{Z}^d$. The
construction must be {\em consistent} (that is, satisfy the natural extension
of the Euclidean axioms) while resembling them as much as possible. Previous
work has shown asymptotically tight results in two dimensions with $\Theta(\log
N)$ error, where resemblance between segments is measured with the Hausdorff
distance, and $N$ is the $L_1$ distance between the two points. This
construction was considered tight because of a $\Omega(\log N)$ lower bound
that applies to any consistent construction in $\mathbb{Z}^2$.
  In this paper we observe that the lower bound does not directly extend to
higher dimensions. We give an alternative argument showing that any consistent
construction in $d$ dimensions must have $\Omega(\log^{1/(d-1)} N)$ error. We
tie the error of a consistent construction in high dimensions to the error of
similar {\em weak} constructions in two dimensions (constructions for which
some points need not satisfy all the axioms). This not only opens the
possibility for having constructions with $o(\log N)$ error in high dimensions,
but also opens up an interesting line of research in the tradeoff between the
number of axiom violations and the error of the construction. In order to show
our lower bound, we also consider a colored variation of the concept of
discrepancy of a set of points that we find of independent interest.

high-redshift, strongly gravitationally lensed, dusty star-forming galaxies
(DSFGs) in a 2500 square degree cosmological mm-wave survey. We present the
final spectroscopic redshift survey of this flux-limited ($S_{870\, \mathrm{\mu
m}} > 25\, \mathrm{mJy}$) sample, initially selected at $1.4$ mm. The redshift
survey was conducted with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array
across the $3$ mm spectral window, targeting carbon monoxide line emission. By
combining these measurements with ancillary data, the SPT sample is now
spectroscopically complete, with redshifts spanning $1.9$$<$$z$$<$$6.9$ and a
median of $z=3.9 \pm 0.2$. We present the mm through far-infrared photometry
and spectral energy density fits for all sources, along with their inferred
intrinsic properties.
  Comparing the properties of the SPT sources to the unlensed DSFG population,
we demonstrate that the SPT-selected DSFGs represent the most extreme
infrared-luminous galaxies, even after accounting for strong gravitational
lensing. The SPT sources have a median star formation rate of $2.3(2)\times
10^3\, \mathrm{M_\odot yr^{-1}}$ and a median dust mass of $1.4(1)\times10^9\,
\mathrm{M_\odot}$. However, the inferred gas depletion timescales of the SPT
sources are comparable to those of unlensed DSFGs, once redshift is taken into
account. This SPT sample contains roughly half of the known spectroscopically
confirmed DSFGs at $z$$>$$5$, making this the largest sample of high-redshift
DSFGs to-date, and enabling the ""high-redshift tail"" of extremely luminous
DSFGs to be measured. Though galaxy formation models struggle to account for
the SPT redshift distribution, the larger sample statistics from this complete
and well-defined survey will help inform future theoretical efforts.

spectral methods. In this paper, we first develop an $\ell_p$ perturbation
theory for a hollowed version of PCA in Hilbert spaces which provably improves
upon the vanilla PCA in the presence of heteroscedastic noises. Through a novel
$\ell_p$ analysis of eigenvectors, we investigate entrywise behaviors of
principal component score vectors and show that they can be approximated by
linear functionals of the Gram matrix in $\ell_p$ norm, which includes $\ell_2$
and $\ell_\infty$ as special examples. For sub-Gaussian mixture models, the
choice of $p$ giving optimal bounds depends on the signal-to-noise ratio, which
further yields optimality guarantees for spectral clustering. For contextual
community detection, the $\ell_p$ theory leads to a simple spectral algorithm
that achieves the information threshold for exact recovery. These also provide
optimal recovery results for Gaussian mixture and stochastic block models as
special cases.

the effective number of distinct points in the space. The contribution of each

accurately these spectra can be described within a pure Kohn-Sham
time-dependent density-functional framework, i.e., a framework in which no
theory beyond Kohn-Sham density-functional theory, such as $GW$, is required to
correct the Kohn-Sham gap. To achieve this goal we adapted a recent approach we
developed for the optical spectra of 3D systems [Cavo, Berger, Romaniello,

the link between the exchange-correlation kernel of TDDFT and the derivative

correct quasi-particle gap, and on a generalization of the polarization
functional [Berger, Phys. Rev. Lett., 115, 137402 (2015)], which describes the

redistricting, it is important to measure them. Many measures of partisan bias
are satisfactory for states that are balanced with roughly equal proportions of
voters for the two major parties. It has been less clear which metrics measure
fairness robustly when the proportion of the vote is unbalanced by as little as
60% to 40%. We have addressed this by analyzing past election results for four
states with Democratic preferences (CA, IL, MA, and MD), three states with
Republican preferences (SC, TN, and TX) and comparing those to results for four
nearly balanced states (CO, NC, OH, and PA). We used many past statewide
elections in each state to build statistically precise seats for votes and rank
for votes graphs to which many measures of partisan bias were applied. In
addition to providing values of responsiveness, we find that five of the
measures of bias provide mutually consistent values in all states, thereby
providing a core of usable measures for unbalanced states. Although all five
measures focus on different aspects of partisan bias, normalization of the
values across the eleven states provides a suitable way to compare them, and we
propose that their average provides a superior measure which we call composite
bias. Regarding other measures, we find that the most seemingly plausible
symmetry measure fails for unbalanced states. We also consider deviations from
the proportionality ideal, but using it is difficult because the political
geography of a state can entangle responsiveness with total partisan bias. We
do not attempt to separate intentional partisan bias from the implicit bias
that results from the interaction of the map drawing rules of a state and its
political geography, on the grounds that redistricting should attempt to
minimize total partisan bias whatever its provenance.

for ReLU neurons. Unlike previous single-neuron relaxations which focus only on
the univariate input space of the ReLU, our method considers the multivariate
input space of the affine pre-activation function preceding the ReLU. Using
results from submodularity and convex geometry, we derive an explicit
description of the tightest possible convex relaxation when this multivariate

stronger than the commonly used univariate-input relaxation which has been
proposed as a natural convex relaxation barrier for verification. While our
description of the relaxation may require an exponential number of
inequalities, we show that they can be separated in linear time and hence can
be efficiently incorporated into optimization algorithms on an as-needed basis.
Based on this novel relaxation, we design two polynomial-time algorithms for
neural network verification: a linear-programming-based algorithm that
leverages the full power of our relaxation, and a fast propagation algorithm
that generalizes existing approaches. In both cases, we show that for a modest
increase in computational effort, our strengthened relaxation enables us to
verify a significantly larger number of instances compared to similar

have a different number of real solutions, the parameter space is decomposed
into regions whose boundary forms the real discriminant locus. This article
views locating the real discriminant locus as a supervised classification
problem in machine learning where the goal is to determine classification
boundaries over the parameter space, with the classes being the number of real
solutions. For multidimensional parameter spaces, this article presents a novel
sampling method which carefully samples the parameter space. At each sample
point, homotopy continuation is used to obtain the number of real solutions to
the corresponding polynomial system. Machine learning techniques including
nearest neighbor and deep learning are used to efficiently approximate the real
discriminant locus. One application of having learned the real discriminant
locus is to develop a real homotopy method that only tracks the real solution
paths unlike traditional methods which track all~complex~solution~paths.
Examples show that the proposed approach can efficiently approximate
complicated solution boundaries such as those arising from the equilibria of
the Kuramoto model.

large-scale problems, the labels typically have certain (unknown) hierarchy. In
this paper we exploit the sparsity of label vectors and the hierarchical
structure to embed them in low-dimensional space using label groupings.
Consequently, we solve the classification problem in a much lower dimensional
space and then obtain labels in the original space using an appropriately
defined lifting. Our method builds on the work of (Ubaru & Mazumdar, 2017),
where the idea of group testing was also explored for multilabel

also allows us, using recent results, to develop a fast prediction algorithm
that has a logarithmic runtime in the number of labels. We then present a
hierarchical partitioning approach that exploits the label hierarchy in large
scale problems to divide up the large label space and create smaller
sub-problems, which can then be solved independently via the grouping approach.

However, comparing different sparse topologies and determining how sparse

sparse structure optimization is involved, remain as challenging open
questions. This comparison becomes increasingly complex as the number of
possible topological comparisons increases exponentially with the size of
networks. In this work, we introduce an approach to understand and compare
sparse neural network topologies from the perspective of graph theory. We first
propose Neural Network Sparse Topology Distance (NNSTD) to measure the distance
between different sparse neural networks. Further, we demonstrate that sparse
neural networks can outperform over-parameterized models in terms of
performance, even without any further structure optimization. To the end, we
also show that adaptive sparse connectivity can always unveil a plenitude of
sparse sub-networks with very different topologies which outperform the dense

emergence of massive stars expels the residual gas, which has not formed stars
yet. Gas expulsion lowers the gravitational potential of the embedded cluster,
unbinding many of the cluster stars. These stars then move on their own
trajectories in the external gravitational field of the Galaxy, forming a tidal
tail. We investigate the formation and evolution of the tidal tail forming due
to expulsion of primordial gas under various scenarios of gas expulsion to
provide predictions for tidal tails around dynamically evolved (age > 100 Myr)
galactic star clusters, which can be possibly detected by the Gaia mission. We
provide a semi-analytical model for the tail evolution. We find that tidal
tails released during gas expulsion have different kinematic properties than
the tails gradually forming due to evaporation. The gas expulsion tidal tail
shows non-monotonic expansion with time, where longer epochs of expansion are
interspersed with shorter epochs of contraction. The tail thickness and
velocity dispersions strongly, but not exactly periodically, vary with time.
The times of minima of tail thickness and velocity dispersions are given only
by the properties of the galactic potential, and not by the properties of the
cluster. The estimates provided by the (semi-)analytical model for the extent
of the tail, the minima of tail thickness, and velocity dispersions are in a
very good agreement with the nbody6 simulations. This implies that the
semi-analytic model can be used for estimating the properties of the gas
expulsion tidal tail for a cluster of a given age and orbital parameters
without the necessity of performing numerical simulations. A study with a more

around $1-30$ keV. We show that a straightforward model of inelastic dark
matter produced via early universe thermal freeze-out annihilation can account
for the XENON1T excess. Remarkably, this dark matter model consists of a few
simple elements: sub-GeV mass Dirac fermion dark matter coupled to a lighter
dark photon kinetically mixed with the Standard Model photon. A scalar field
charged under the dark U(1) gauge symmetry can provide a mass for the dark
photon and splits the Dirac fermion component state masses by a few keV, which
survive in equal abundance and interact inelastically with electrons and
nuclei.

did extensive evaluations on multiple GPU platforms and inference engines.
While achieving $\geq 81.3\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, GENet is up to $6.4$

designing reward functions can be extremely challenging, a more promising
approach is to directly learn reward functions from human teachers.
Importantly, data from human teachers can be collected either passively or
actively in a variety of forms: passive data sources include demonstrations,
(e.g., kinesthetic guidance), whereas preferences (e.g., comparative rankings)
are actively elicited. Prior research has independently applied reward learning
to these different data sources. However, there exist many domains where
multiple sources are complementary and expressive. Motivated by this general
problem, we present a framework to integrate multiple sources of information,
which are either passively or actively collected from human users. In
particular, we present an algorithm that first utilizes user demonstrations to
initialize a belief about the reward function, and then actively probes the
user with preference queries to zero-in on their true reward. This algorithm
not only enables us combine multiple data sources, but it also informs the
robot when it should leverage each type of information. Further, our approach
accounts for the human's ability to provide data: yielding user-friendly
preference queries which are also theoretically optimal. Our extensive
simulated experiments and user studies on a Fetch mobile manipulator
demonstrate the superiority and the usability of our integrated framework.

disorder at large packing densities. Experiments and numerical simulation of
this unexpected phenomenon show excellent agreement with each other, revealing
two rotational phases as a function of excitation intensity, respectively the
low-drive (LDR) and the moderate-drive (MDR) regimes. In the LDR, interdisk

simple energy-dissipation arguments are provided, that support the observed

points (measurements) is a fundamental problem in science and engineering. This
is often formulated as a minimum norm interpolation problem, regularized
learning problem or, in general, a semi-discrete inverse problem, in certain
functional spaces. The choice of an appropriate space is crucial for solutions
of these problems. Motivated by sparse representations of the reconstructed
functions such as compressed sensing and sparse learning, much of the recent
research interest has been directed to considering these problems in certain
Banach spaces in order to obtain their sparse solutions, which is a feasible
approach to overcome challenges coming from the big data nature of most
practical applications. It is the goal of this paper to provide a systematic
study of the representer theorems for these problems in Banach spaces. There
are a few existing results for these problems in a Banach space, with all of
them regarding implicit representer theorems. We aim at obtaining explicit
representer theorems based on which convenient solution methods will then be
developed. For the minimum norm interpolation, the explicit representer
theorems enable us to express the infimum in terms of the norm of the linear
combination of the interpolation functionals. For the purpose of developing
efficient computational algorithms, we establish the fixed-point equation
formulation of solutions of these problems. We reveal that unlike in a Hilbert
space, in general, solutions of these problems in a Banach space may not be
able to be reduced to truly finite dimensional problems (with certain infinite
dimensional components hidden). We demonstrate how this obstacle can be
removed, reducing the original problem to a truly finite dimensional one, in
the special case when the Banach space is $\ell_1(\mathbb{N})$.

attention, as a key step to several human-centric applications. However,
generalizability of human pose estimation models developed using supervision on
large-scale in-studio datasets remains questionable, as these models often
perform unsatisfactorily on unseen in-the-wild environments. Though
weakly-supervised models have been proposed to address this shortcoming,
performance of such models relies on availability of paired supervision on some
related tasks, such as 2D pose or multi-view image pairs. In contrast, we
propose a novel kinematic-structure-preserved unsupervised 3D pose estimation
framework, which is not restrained by any paired or unpaired weak supervisions.
Our pose estimation framework relies on a minimal set of prior knowledge that
defines the underlying kinematic 3D structure, such as skeletal joint
connectivity information with bone-length ratios in a fixed canonical scale.
The proposed model employs three consecutive differentiable transformations
named as forward-kinematics, camera-projection and spatial-map transformation.
This design not only acts as a suitable bottleneck stimulating effective pose
disentanglement but also yields interpretable latent pose representations
avoiding training of an explicit latent embedding to pose mapper. Furthermore,
devoid of unstable adversarial setup, we re-utilize the decoder to formalize an
energy-based loss, which enables us to learn from in-the-wild videos, beyond
laboratory settings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our state-of-the-art
unsupervised and weakly-supervised pose estimation performance on both
Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP datasets. Qualitative results on unseen environments
further establish our superior generalization ability.

new millennium and energy prices affecting headline inflation not only via the
Phillips curve but also via an independent expectational channel. A
high-frequency energy price cycle can be related to global factors affecting
the commodity market, and often overpowers the Phillips curve thereby
explaining the inflation puzzles of the last ten years.

infrastructure data from Computer-Aided Design (CAD) to Geographic Information
System (GIS) format, the process can be complex, expensive, and time-consuming.
Given that municipal employees often prefer to continue performing work in both
CAD and GIS, depending on the type of work required, an improved conversion
process would help municipalities more fully employ GIS-based analyses.
Municipalities facing budget and capacity challenges would especially benefit
from an improved conversion process. With advances in GIS functionality and the
promise of smart and connected cities, more emphasis is placed on the quality
of data, and in this case, the potential loss of data quality from CAD to GIS
formats. The goals of this article are twofold. First, to understand the common
practices municipalities use to convert infrastructure CAD data to GIS and the
specific challenges they face. Second, based on knowledge of those practices
and challenges, this article proposes a five-step process to reduce common
conversion errors and reduce the time required to correct these errors. The
process is illustrated through the conversion of CAD data from the University
of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) campus. The findings were validated with
qualitative, semi-structured interviews conducted with GIS Analysts and
Managers working in eleven municipalities across the United States who directly
manage at least one of the following infrastructures: water, sanitary sewer, or
stormwater sewer systems. The interviews confirmed the challenges
municipalities faced with the conversion and identified solutions interviewees
undertook to enable data-informed decision-making.

of color evolution implies that it is not a supernovae and instead is strongly

of problems involving sequential data, but their optimization is sensitive to
parameter initialization, architecture, and optimizer hyperparameters.
Considering RNNs as dynamical systems, a natural way to capture stability,
i.e., the growth and decay over long iterates, are the Lyapunov Exponents
(LEs), which form the Lyapunov spectrum. The LEs have a bearing on stability of
RNN training dynamics because forward propagation of information is related to
the backward propagation of error gradients. LEs measure the asymptotic rates
of expansion and contraction of nonlinear system trajectories, and generalize
stability analysis to the time-varying attractors structuring the
non-autonomous dynamics of data-driven RNNs. As a tool to understand and
exploit stability of training dynamics, the Lyapunov spectrum fills an existing
gap between prescriptive mathematical approaches of limited scope and
computationally-expensive empirical approaches. To leverage this tool, we
implement an efficient way to compute LEs for RNNs during training, discuss the
aspects specific to standard RNN architectures driven by typical sequential
datasets, and show that the Lyapunov spectrum can serve as a robust readout of
training stability across hyperparameters. With this exposition-oriented
contribution, we hope to draw attention to this understudied, but theoretically
grounded tool for understanding training stability in RNNs.

observed age-specific mortality data, modeling and forecasting can be taken
place in two routes. On the one hand, we can first truncate the available data

age-range model. On the other hand, with all available data, we can first apply
a full age-range model to produce forecasts and then truncate the mortality
forecasts to retiree ages. We investigate the difference in modeling the
logarithmic transformation of the central mortality rates between a partial
age-range and a full age-range model, using data from mainly developed
countries in the Human Mortality Database (2020). By evaluating and comparing
the short-term point and interval forecast accuracies, we recommend the first
strategy by truncating all available data to retiree ages and then produce
mortality forecasts. However, when considering the long-term forecasts, it is
unclear which strategy is better since it is more difficult to find a model and
parameters that are optimal. This is a disadvantage of using methods based on
time series extrapolation for long-term forecasting. Instead, an expectation
approach, in which experts set a future target, could be considered, noting
that this method has also had limited success in the past.

the conduction state at $Ra \approx 1708$, and has a characteristic aspect
ratio (length/height) of approximately $2$. The primary solution corresponds to
one pair of counterclockwise-clockwise convection rolls with a temperature
updraft in between and an adjacent downdraft on the sides. By adjusting the
horizontal length of the domain, (Waleffe, 2015; Sondak, 2015) also found
steady, maximal heat transport solutions, with characteristic aspect ratio less
than $2$ and decreasing with increasing $Ra$. Compared to the primary
solutions, optimal heat transport solutions have modifications to boundary
layer thickness, the horizontal length scale of the plume, and the structure of
the downdrafts. The current study establishes a direct link between these
(unstable) steady solutions and transition to turbulence for $Pr = 7$ and $Pr =
100$. For transitional values of $Ra$, the primary and optimal heat transport

time-evolving temperature fields. For $Ra$ beyond transitional, our data

optimal heat transport solutions are more easily detectable for $Pr = 100$. In
both cases $Pr = 7$ and $Pr = 100$, the relative prevalence of primary and

hurricane evacuation, the level of ease of residents in an area in reaching
evacuation destination sites through the road network, is a critical component
of emergency management. While many studies have attempted to measure road
accessibility (either in the scope of evacuation or beyond), few have
considered both dynamic evacuation demand and characteristics of a hurricane.
This study proposes a methodological framework to achieve this goal. In an
interval of every six hours, the method first estimates the evacuation demand
in terms of number of vehicles per household in each county subdivision by
considering the hurricane's wind radius and track. The closest facility
analysis is then employed to model evacuees' route choices towards the
predefined evacuation destinations. The potential crowdedness index (PCI), a
metric capturing the level of crowdedness of each road segment, is then
computed by coupling the estimated evacuation demand and route choices.
Finally, the road accessibility of each sub-county is measured by calculating
the reciprocal of the sum of PCI values of corresponding roads connecting
evacuees from the sub-county to the designated destinations. The method is
applied to the entire state of Florida during Hurricane Irma in September 2017.
Results show that I-75 and I-95 northbound have a high level of congestion, and
sub-counties along the northbound I-95 suffer from the worst road
accessibility. In addition, this research performs a sensitivity analysis for
examining the impacts of different choices of behavioral response curves on
accessibility results.

Part$(n)$ of all partitions of an $n$-element set has a four-element generating
set. In 1983, L. Z\'adori gave a new proof of this fact with a particularly
elegant construction. Based on his construction from 1983, the present paper
gives a lower bound on the number $\nu(n)$ of four-element generating sets of
Part$(n)$. We also present a computer assisted statistical approach to $\nu(n)$
for small values of $n$.
  In his 1983 paper, L. Z\'adori also proved that for $n\geq 7$, the lattice
Part$(n)$ has a four element generating set that is not an antichain. He left
the problem whether such a generating set for $n\in\{5,6\}$ exists open. Here
we solve this problem in negative for $n=5$ and in affirmative for $n=6$.
  Finally, the main theorem asserts that the direct product of some powers of
partition lattices is four-generated. In particular, by the first part of this
theorem, Part$(n_1)\times$ Part$(n_2)$ is four-generated for any two distinct
integers $n_1$ and $n_2$ that are at least 5. The second part of the theorem is
technical but it has two corollaries that are easy to understand. Namely, the
direct product Part$(n)$ $\times$ Part$(n+1)$ $\times\dots\times$ Part$(3n-14)$
is four-generated for each integer $n\geq 9$. Also, for every positive integer
$u$, the $u$-th the direct power of the direct product Part$(n)$ $\times$
Part$(n+1)$ $\times\dots\times$ Part$(n+u-1)$ is four-generated for all but
finitely many $n$. If we do not insist on too many direct factors, then the
exponent can be quite large. For example, our theorem implies that the
$10^{127}$-th direct power of Part$(1011)$ $\times$ Part$(1012)$ $\times \dots
\times$ Part$(2020)$ is four-generated.

stellar parameters has received special attention. The construction of reliable
registries of activity reveals that solar type stars exhibit activity cycles
with periods from few years to decades and, in same cases, long and short
activity cycles coexist suggesting that two dynamos could operate in these
stars. In particular, Epsilon Eridani is an active young K2V star (0.8 Gyr),
which exhibits a short and long-term chromospheric cycles of near 3 and 13-yr
periods. Additionally, between 1985 and 1992, the star went through a broad
activity minimum, similar to the solar Maunder Minimum-state. Motivated by
these results, we found in Epsilon Eridani a great opportunity to test the
dynamo theory. Based on the model developed in Sraibman & Minotti (2019), in
this work we built a non linear axisymmetric dynamo for Epsilon Eridani. The
time series of the simulated magnetic field components near the surface
integrated in all the stellar disc exhibits both the long and short-activity
cycles with periods similar to the ones detected from observations and also
time intervals of low activity which could be associated to the broad Minimun.
The short activity cycle associated to the magnetic reversal could be explained
by the differential rotation, while the long cycle is associated to the
meridional mass flows induced by the Lorentz force. In this way, we show that a
single non-linear dynamo model derived from first principles with accurate
stellar parameters could reproduce coexisting activity cycles.

obstacle to implementing QAE in near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum

classical post-processing techniques like maximum likelihood estimation (MLE).
Existing analyses as to the optimality of various query schedules in these

analyse QPE-free QAE under common noise models that may afflict NISQ devices

demonstrate that, given an accurate noise characterization of one's system, one

mutational fuzzing, we produce a data set with more than 1 million Spectre-V1

investigated. Coulomb screening is evaluated in a relativistic thermal plasma
in which electrons and positrons are in equilibrium. In addition to temperature
effects, effects on weak screening from a strong external magnetic field are
evaluated. In high fields, the electron transverse momentum components are
quantized into Landau levels. The characteristic plasma screening length at
high temperatures and at high magnetic fields is explored. In addition to
changes to the screening length, changes in weak interaction rates are
estimated. It is found that high fields can result in increased $\beta$-decay
rates as the electron and positron spectra are dominated by Landau levels.
Finally, the effects studied here are evaluated in a simple r-process model. It
is found that relativistic Coulomb screening has a small effect on the final
abundance distribution. While changes in weak interaction rates in strong
magnetic fields can have an effect on the r-process evolution and abundance
distribution, the field strength required to have a significant effect may be

randomness-induced spin-liquid-like state that is a close analogue to the well
known random-singlet (RS) state of the random Heisenberg chain. The 2D RS state
arises from spinons localized at topological defects. The interacting spinons
form a critical state with mean spin-spin correlations decaying with distance
$r$ as $r^{-2}$, as in the 1D RS state. The dynamic exponent $z \ge 2$, varying
continuously with the model parameters. We here further investigate the
properties of the RS state in the $J$-$Q$ model with random $Q$ couplings. We
study the temperature dependence of the specific heat and various
susceptibilities for large enough systems to reach the thermodynamic limit and
also analyze the size dependence of the critical magnetic order parameter and
its susceptibility in the ground state. For all these quantities, we find
consistency with conventional quantum-critical scaling when the condition
implied by the $r^{-2}$ form of the spin correlations is imposed. All

cosmological solutions for a flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe; and we
assume the late future time behavior when the dark energy dominates the cosmic

$p=w(a)\rho$, the dark energy has an energy density, temperature and entropy
well defined and an interesting result is that there is no entropy production

two cases are studied: $\xi=const.$ and $\xi =(\beta/\sqrt{3}) \rho^{1/2}$; it
is found that the entropy grows exponentially for the first case and as a
power-law for the second. In the Israel-Stewart theory we consider a $\xi
=\xi_0 \rho^{1/2}$ and a relaxation time $\tau = \xi/\rho$; an analytical Big
Rip solution is obtained with a power-law entropy. In all cases a power-law
relation between temperature and energy density is obtained. In order to
maintain the second law of thermodynamics theoretical constraints for the

areas did not greatly decrease during the social distancing period. In
addition, while all the cities exhibited overall decreasing visits to POIs, one

proportion of visits to some POIs (e.g., Restaurant and Other Eating Places)
remained stable during the social distancing period, while some POIs had an

gauge theory (LGT) calculations employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)

present limitations of MCMC techniques may be overcome by Hamiltonian-based
simulations on classical or quantum devices, which further provide the
potential to address questions that lay beyond the capabilities of the current
approaches. However, for continuous gauge groups, Hamiltonian-based
formulations involve infinite-dimensional gauge degrees of freedom that can
solely be handled by truncation. Current truncation schemes require
dramatically increasing computational resources at small values of the bare
couplings, where magnetic field effects become important. Such limitation
precludes one from `taking the continuous limit' while working with finite
resources. To overcome this limitation, we provide a resource-efficient
protocol to simulate LGTs with continuous gauge groups in the Hamiltonian
formulation. Our new method allows for calculations at arbitrary values of the
bare coupling and lattice spacing. The approach consists of the combination of
a Hilbert space truncation with a regularization of the gauge group, which
permits an efficient description of the magnetically-dominated regime. We focus
here on Abelian gauge theories and use $2+1$ dimensional quantum
electrodynamics as a benchmark example to demonstrate this efficient framework
to achieve the continuum limit in LGTs. This possibility is a key requirement
to make quantitative predictions at the field theory level and offers the
long-term perspective to utilise quantum simulations to compute physically
meaningful quantities in regimes that are precluded to quantum Monte Carlo.

computations in the face of intrinsic stochasticity in individual neurons,
imprecisely specified synaptic connectivity, and nonnegligible delays in
synaptic transmission. A common approach to combatting such biological
heterogeneity involves averaging over large redundant networks of $N$ neurons
resulting in coding errors that decrease classically as $1/\sqrt{N}$. Recent
work demonstrated a novel mechanism whereby recurrent spiking networks could
efficiently encode dynamic stimuli, achieving a superclassical scaling in which
coding errors decrease as $1/N$. This specific mechanism involved two key
ideas: predictive coding, and a tight balance, or cancellation between strong
feedforward inputs and strong recurrent feedback. However, the theoretical
principles governing the efficacy of balanced predictive coding and its
robustness to noise, synaptic weight heterogeneity and communication delays
remain poorly understood. To discover such principles, we introduce an
analytically tractable model of balanced predictive coding, in which the degree
of balance and the degree of weight disorder can be dissociated unlike in
previous balanced network models, and we develop a mean field theory of coding
accuracy. Overall, our work provides and solves a general theoretical framework
for dissecting the differential contributions neural noise, synaptic disorder,
chaos, synaptic delays, and balance to the fidelity of predictive neural codes,
reveals the fundamental role that balance plays in achieving superclassical
scaling, and unifies previously disparate models in theoretical neuroscience.

theoretical model for zero-day exploits markets. In our model, one exploit is
being sold to multiple buyers. There are two kinds of buyers, which we call the
defenders and the offenders. The defenders are buyers who buy vulnerabilities
in order to fix them (e.g., software vendors). The offenders, on the other
hand, are buyers who intend to utilize the exploits (e.g., national security

exploit is a piece of information, so one exploit can be sold to multiple
buyers. Second, buyers have externalities. If one defender wins, then the
exploit becomes worthless to the offenders. Third, if we disclose the details
of the exploit to the buyers before the auction, then they may leave with the
information without paying. On the other hand, if we do not disclose the
details, then it is difficult for the buyers to come up with their private
valuations. Considering the above, our proposed mechanism discloses the details
of the exploit to all offenders before the auction. The offenders then pay to
delay the exploit being disclosed to the defenders.

latency). While improvements in consensus techniques can lead to lower
confirmation latency, a fundamental lower bound on confirmation latency is the
propagation latency of messages through the underlying peer-to-peer (p2p)
network (inBitcoin, the propagation latency is several tens of seconds). The de
facto p2p protocol used by Bitcoin and other blockchains is based on random
connectivity: each node connects to a random subset of nodes. The induced p2p
network topology can be highly suboptimal since it neglects geographical
distance, differences in bandwidth, hash-power and computational abilities
across peers. We present Perigee, a decentralized algorithm that automatically
learns an efficient p2p topology tuned to the aforementioned network
heterogeneities, purely based on peers' interactions with their neighbors.
Motivated by the literature on the multi-armed bandit problem, Perigee
optimally balances the tradeoff between retaining connections to known
well-connected neighbors, and exploring new connections to previously-unseen
neighbors. Experimental evaluations show that Perigee reduces the latency to
broadcast by $33\%$. Lastly Perigee is simple, computationally lightweight,
adversary-resistant, and compatible with the selfish interests of peers, making
it an attractive p2p protocol for blockchains.

the process of QST can be fulfilled by considering the dynamical behavior of
its entanglement content. One well-established approach to continuously
transfer quantum states is utilizing spin structures. Here, from the view of
entanglement propagation, we disclose the signature of fractional QST
possibilities. In the present work, we proposed a form of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$
triangular plaquette whose Hamiltonian entails the spin-orbit coupling on the
rungs and exchange interaction over the legs. The feature of such a system is
that the time instants of QST emerge in a discrete fashion, thereby the values
of exchange interactions associated with these moments behave fractionally.
Importantly, it is found that for special values of magnetic interaction, QST
has singularity i.e., the entanglement propagation is forbidden. In addition,
the finite-size nature of this system makes it possible for us to read the
nexus between time crystallinity and symmetry breaking. The development of our
knowledge about time crystalline symmetry and its breaking helps us to

players to team success. Our approach is based on spectral analysis, a
technique from algebraic signal processing, which has several appealing
features. First, our analysis decomposes the team success signal into
components that are naturally understood as the contributions of player groups
of a given size: individuals, pairs, triples, fours, and full five-player
lineups. Secondly, the decomposition is orthogonal so that contributions of a
player group can be thought of as pure: Contributions attributed to a group of
three, for example, have been separated from the lower-order contributions of
constituent pairs and individuals. We present detailed a spectral analysis
using NBA play-by-play data and show how this can be a practical tool in
understanding lineup composition and utilization.

  Problems","26 pages, 3 figures",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  We first consider the problem of approximating a few eigenvalues of a
rational matrix-valued function closest to a prescribed target. It is assumed
that the proper rational part of the rational matrix-valued function is
expressed in the transfer function form $H(s) = C (sI - A)^{-1} B$, where the
middle factor is large, whereas the number of rows of $C$ and the number of
columns of $B$ are equal and small. We propose a subspace framework that
performs two-sided or one-sided projections on the state-space representation
of $H(\cdot)$, commonly employed in model reduction and giving rise to a
reduced transfer function. At every iteration, the projection subspaces are
expanded to attain Hermite interpolation conditions at the eigenvalues of the
reduced transfer function closest to the target, which in turn leads to a new
reduced transfer function. We prove in theory that, when a sequence of
eigenvalues of the reduced transfer functions converges to an eigenvalue of the
full problem, it converges at least at a quadratic rate. In the second part, we
extend the proposed framework to locate the eigenvalues of a general square
large-scale nonlinear meromorphic matrix-valued function $T(\cdot)$, where we
exploit a representation $\mathcal{R}(s) = C(s) A(s)^{-1} B(s) - D(s)$ defined
in terms of the block components of $T(\cdot)$. The numerical experiments
illustrate that the proposed framework is reliable in locating a few
eigenvalues closest to the target point, and that, with respect to runtime, it
is competitive to established methods for nonlinear eigenvalue problems.

of sensors having different fields-of-view (FoVs). Specifically, a cardinality
probability hypothesis density (CPHD) filter is run at each sensor node. Due to
the fact that each sensor node has a limited FoV, the commonly adopted fusion
methods become unreliable. In fact, the monitored area of multiple sensor nodes
consists of several parts that are either exclusive of a single node, i.e.
exclusive FoVs (eFoVs) or common to multiple (at least two) nodes, i.e. common
FoVs (cFoVs). In this setting, the crucial issue is how to account for this
different information sets in the fusion rule. The problem is particularly
challenging when the knowledge of the FoVs is unreliable, for example because
of the presence of obstacles and target misdetection, or when the FoVs are
time-varying. Considering these issues, we propose an effective fusion
algorithm for the case of unknown FoVs, where: i) the intensity function is
decomposed into multiple sub-intensities/groups by means of a clustering
algorithm; ii) the corresponding cardinality distribution is reconstructed by
approximating the target random finite set (RFS) as multi-Bernoulli; and iii)
fusion is performed in parallel according to either generalized covariance
intersection (GCI) or arithmetic average (AA) rule. Simulation experiments are
provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Dissipativity can express stability and performance jointly, but existing
results are limited to the regions around the equilibrium points of these
nonlinear systems. The incremental framework, based on the convergence of the
system trajectories, removes this limitation. We investigate how stability and
performance characterizations of nonlinear systems in the incremental framework
are linked to dissipativity, and how general performance characterization
beyond the $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain concept can be understood in this framework.
This paper presents a matrix inequalities-based convex incremental
dissipativity analysis for nonlinear systems via quadratic storage and supply
functions. The proposed dissipativity analysis links the notions of
incremental, differential, and general dissipativity. We show that through
differential dissipativity, incremental and general dissipativity of the
nonlinear system can be guaranteed. These results also lead to the incremental
extensions of the $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain, the generalized $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm,
the $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-gain, and passivity of nonlinear systems.

effect generated by low-density regions of the universe, but insensitive to
selection effects associated with voids. We apply it to the DR8 galaxy
catalogue of the DESI Legacy imaging surveys, and obtain the LDPs at $z\leq
0.6$ over $\sim$ 20000 $deg^2$ sky coverage. We then cross correlate with the
Planck temperature map, and detect the ISW effect at $3.2\sigma$. We further
compare the measurement with numerical simulations of the concordance
$\Lambda$CDM cosmology, and find the ISW amplitude parameter
$A_{ISW}=1.14\pm0.38$ when we adopt a LDP definition radius $R_s=3^{'}$, fully
consistent with the prediction of the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology
($A_{ISW}=1$). This agreement with $\Lambda$CDM cosmology holds for all the
galaxy samples and $R_s$ that we have investigated. Furthermore, the S/N is
comparable to that of galaxy ISW measurement. These results demonstrate the LDP
method as a competitive alternative to existing ISW measurement methods, and

  Conference Paper",,"10.1007/978-3-030-50371-0_38",,"physics.soc-ph","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  People often help others who are in trouble, especially in emergency
evacuation situations. For instance, during the 2005 London bombings, it was
reported that evacuees helped injured persons to escape the place of danger. In
terms of game theory, it can be understood that such helping behavior provides
a collective good while it is a costly behavior because the volunteers spend
extra time to assist the injured persons in case of emergency evacuations. In
order to study the collective effects of helping behavior in emergency
evacuations, we have performed numerical simulations of helping behavior among
evacuees in a room evacuation scenario. Our simulation model is based on the
volunteer's dilemma game reflecting volunteering cost. The game theoretic model
is coupled with a social force model to understand the relationship between the
spatial and social dynamics of evacuation scenarios. By systematically changing
the cost parameter of helping behavior, we observed different patterns of
collective helping behaviors and these collective patterns are summarized with
a phase diagram.

images based on the provided conditions, \eg, class-level distributions.
However, existing methods have used the same generating architecture for all
classes. This paper presents a novel idea that adopts NAS to find a distinct
architecture for each class. The search space contains regular and
class-modulated convolutions, where the latter is designed to introduce
class-specific information while avoiding the reduction of training data for
each class generator. The search algorithm follows a weight-sharing pipeline
with mixed-architecture optimization so that the search cost does not grow with
the number of classes. To learn the sampling policy, a Markov decision process
is embedded into the search algorithm and a moving average is applied for
better stability. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100. Besides
achieving better image generation quality in terms of FID scores, we discover
several insights that are helpful in designing cGAN models. Code is available

modification of 2D TMDCs is mainly limited to their defective sites, or it
requires a conversion of TMDC from its semiconducting into a metallic phase. In
this work, we show that the basal plane of a 2D semiconductor molybdenum
disulfide (MoS2) can be modified by electrochemical grafting of aryl-diazonium
salt, such as 3,5-bis(trifluoromethyl)benzenediazonium tetrafluoroborate. To
investigate the applicability of this method, we perform electrografting on
MoS2 nanoribbons by addressing them individually via a different electrode.
High spatial selectivity of this method on the nanoscale opens the possibility
for specific surface modification of neighboring 2D layers and nanostructures

both with or without constraints. We also show the results of numerical shape

technologies to deliver public services to individuals and organisations

complex systems which needs to be distributed, secured and privacy-preserved,
and the failure of these can be very costly both economically and socially.
Most of the existing e-government systems such as websites and electronic
identity management systems (eIDs) are centralized at duplicated servers and
databases. A centralized management and validation system may suffer from a
single point of failure and make the system a target to cyber attacks such as
malware, denial of service attacks (DoS), and distributed denial of service
attacks (DDoS). The blockchain technology enables the implementation of highly
secure and privacy-preserving decentralized systems where transactions are not
under the control of any third party organizations. Using the blockchain
technology, exiting data and new data are stored in a sealed compartment of
blocks (i.e., ledger) distributed across the network in a verifiable and
immutable way. Information security and privacy are enhanced by the blockchain
technology in which data are encrypted and distributed across the entire
network. This paper proposes a framework of a decentralized e-government
peer-to-peer (p2p) system using the blockchain technology, which can ensure
both information security and privacy while simultaneously increasing the trust

presented, with the support of a theoretical and qualitative analysis of the
security and privacy implications of such system.

omnidirectional images. This requires two characteristics: efficient
compression of data, to lower the storage cost, and random access ability to
extract part of the compressed stream requested by the user (for reducing the
transmission rate). For efficient compression, data needs to be predicted by a
series of references that have been pre-defined and compressed. This contrasts
with the spirit of random accessibility. We propose a solution for this problem
based on incremental codes implemented by rate-adaptive channel codes. This
scheme encodes the image while adapting to any user request and leads to an
efficient coding that is flexible in extracting data depending on the available
information at the decoder. Therefore, only the information that is needed to
be displayed at the user's side is transmitted during the user's request, as if
the request was already known at the encoder. The experimental results
demonstrate that our coder obtains a better transmission rate than the
state-of-the-art tile-based methods at a small cost in storage. Moreover, the
transmission rate grows gradually with the size of the request and avoids a
staircase effect, which shows the perfect suitability of our coder for
interactive transmission.

stratification we use the Coriolis facility in Grenoble (France) which large
size enables us to reach regimes with both low Froude number and large Reynolds

concentration and we force large scale waves in a $6\times6\times 1$ m$^3$

velocity field. We observe a wide band spectrum which is made of waves.
Discrete modes are observed due to the square shape of the flow container as
well as a continuum part which appears consistent with an axisymmetric
superposition of random weakly nonlinear waves. Our observations support the
interpretation of turbulence of a strongly stratified fluid as wave turbulence
of internal waves although our spectrum is quite different from the Garrett &

describe agents. For this framework, he establishes the conditions under which
positive sorting between agents' attributes is the unique market outcome.
Becker's celebrated sorting result has been applied to address many economic
questions. However, recent empirical studies in the fields of health,
household, and labor economics suggest that agents have multiple
outcome-relevant attributes. In this paper, I study a matching model with
multidimensional types. I offer multidimensional generalizations of concordance
and supermodularity to construct three multidimensional sorting patterns and
two classes of multidimensional complementarities. For each of these sorting
patterns, I identify the sufficient conditions which guarantee its optimality.
In practice, we observe sorting patterns between observed attributes that are
aggregated over unobserved characteristics. To reconcile theory with practice,
I establish the link between production complementarities and the aggregated
sorting patterns. Finally, I examine the relationship between agents' health
status and their spouses' education levels among U.S. households within the
framework for multidimensional matching markets. Preliminary analysis reveals a
weak positive association between agents' health status and their spouses'
education levels. This weak positive association is estimated to be a product
of three factors: (a) an attraction between better-educated individuals, (b) an
attraction between healthier individuals, and (c) a weak positive association
between agents' health status and their education levels. The attraction
channel suggests that the insurance risk associated with a two-person family

software engineering (SE) researchers in recent years. This is because they can
often solve many SE challenges without enormous manual feature engineering
effort and complex domain knowledge. Although many DL studies have reported
substantial advantages over other state-of-the-art models on effectiveness,
they often ignore two factors: (1) replicability - whether the reported
experimental result can be approximately reproduced in high probability with
the same DL model and the same data; and (2) reproducibility - whether one
reported experimental findings can be reproduced by new experiments with the
same experimental protocol and DL model, but different sampled real-world data.
Unlike traditional machine learning (ML) models, DL studies commonly overlook
these two factors and declare them as minor threats or leave them for future
work. This is mainly due to high model complexity with many manually set
parameters and the time-consuming optimization process. In this study, we
conducted a literature review on 93 DL studies recently published in twenty SE
journals or conferences. Our statistics show the urgency of investigating these
two factors in SE. Moreover, we re-ran four representative DL models in SE.
Experimental results show the importance of replicability and reproducibility,
where the reported performance of a DL model could not be replicated for an
unstable optimization process. Reproducibility could be substantially
compromised if the model training is not convergent, or if performance is
sensitive to the size of vocabulary and testing data. It is therefore urgent
for the SE community to provide a long-lasting link to a replication package,
enhance DL-based solution stability and convergence, and avoid performance
sensitivity on different sampled data.

is observed, just by cooling and heating of an initial coarse lipid-in-water
dispersion around the lipid melting temperature. The process of nanoparticle
formation is effective even after incorporation of medical drugs of high load,
up to 50 % in the lipid phase. The role of the main governing factors is
clarified, the procedure is optimized, and the possibility for its scaling-up
to industrially relevant amounts is demonstrated.

leave the network if their expected knowledge growth is not realized, which may
cause other firms to also leave the network. The paper discusses two bottom-up
intervention scenarios to prevent, reduce, or delay cascades of firms leaving.
The first one is based on the formalism of network controllability, in which
driver nodes are identified and subsequently incentivized, by reducing their
costs. The second one combines node interventions and network interventions. It
proposes the controlled removal of a single firm and the random replacement of

a fast ($>0.1c$) radiation mediated shock (RMS) that propagates in the wind,
and ultimately breaks out gradually once photons start escaping from the shock
transition layer. In exceptionally strong or aspherical explosions the shock
velocity may even be relativistic. The properties of the breakout signal depend
on the dynamics and structure of the shock during the breakout phase. Here we
present, for the first time, spectra and lightcurves of the breakout emission
of fast Newtonian and mildly relativistic shocks, that were calculated using
self-consistent Monte-Carlo simulations of finite RMS with radiative losses. We
find a strong dependence of the $\nu F_\nu$ peak on shock velocity, ranging
from $\sim 1$ keV for $v_s/c=0.1$ to $\sim 100$ keV for $v_s/c=0.5$, with a
shift to lower energies as losses increase. For all cases studied the spectrum
below the peak exhibits a nearly flat component ($F_\nu \sim \nu^0$) that
extends down to the break frequency below which absorption becomes important.
This implies much bright optical/UV emission than hitherto expected. The
computed lightcurves show a gradual rise over tens to hundreds of seconds for
representative conditions. The application to SN 2008D/XRT 080109 and the
detectability limits are also discussed. We predict a detection rate of about
one per year with eROSITA.

error and the alternating direction method of multipliers methods. Moreover,
two partial LSFP schemes are proposed to reduce the fronthaul signaling

standard single-layer precoding schemes and identify the specific advantage of
each optimization problem.

TiO2-BTO/CoFeB, while the DMI of the TiO2-BTO/CoFeB interface is larger. We
explain the observed phenomena by first-principles calculations, which ascribe
them to the different electronic states around the Fermi level at the

relevant to the brightness variations of the Sun and Sun-like stars. We extend
earlier studies that found the facular-to-sunspot-area ratio diminishes with
total sunspot coverage. Chromospheric indices and the total magnetic flux
enclosed in network and faculae, referred to here as 'facular indices', are
modulated by the amount of facular and network present. We probed the
relationship between various facular and sunspot indices through an empirical
model that takes into account how active regions evolve. This model was
incorporated into a total solar irradiance (TSI) model. The model presented
here replicates most of the observed variability in the facular indices, and is
better at doing so than earlier models. Contrary to recent studies, we found
the relationship between the facular and sunspot indices to be stable over the
past four decades. The model indicates that, like the facular-to-sunspot-area
ratio, the ratio of the variation in chromospheric emission and total network
and facular magnetic flux to sunspot area decreases with the latter. The TSI
model indicates the ratio of the TSI excess from faculae and network to the
deficit from sunspots also declines with sunspot area, with the consequence
being that TSI rises with sunspot area more slowly than if the two quantities
were linearly proportional to one another. The extrapolation of the TSI model
to higher activity levels indicates that in the activity range where Sun-like
stars are observed to switch from growing brighter with increasing activity to
becoming dimmer instead, the activity-dependence of TSI exhibits a similar
transition as sunspot darkening starts to rise more rapidly with activity than
facular brightening. This bolsters the interpretation of this behavior of
Sun-like stars as the transition from a faculae-dominated to a spot-dominated
regime.

genetic material are introduced into a genome. It is an important evolutionary
process that can, for example, play a fundamental role in speciation. Recently
the concept of an overlaid species forest was introduced to represent
introgression histories. Basically this approach takes a putative gene history
in the form of a phylogenetic gene tree and tries to overlay this onto a forest
which usually consists of a collection of lineage trees for the species of
interest. The result is a network called an overlaid species forest in which
genes jump or introgress between lineages. In this paper we study properties of
overlaid species forests, showing that they have various connections with
models for lateral gene transfer, maximum parsimony, and unfolding of
phylogenetic networks. In particular, we show that a certain algorithm called
OSF-B UILDER for constructing overlaid species forests is guaranteed to a
produce a special type of overlaid species forest with a minimum number
introgressions, as well as providing some characterizations for networks that
can arise from overlaid species forests. We expect that these results will be
useful in developing new methods for representing introgression histories, a

such as Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). While data assimilation methods
have been applied in NWP, machine learning techniques, such as Reservoir
Computing (RC), are recently recognized as promising tools to predict
spatio-temporal chaotic systems. However, the sensitivity of the skill of the
machine learning based prediction to the imperfectness of observations is
unclear. In this study, we evaluate the skill of RC with noisy and sparsely
distributed observations. We intensively compare the performances of RC and
Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter (LETKF) by applying them to the
prediction of the Lorenz 96 system. Although RC can successfully predict the
Lorenz 96 system if the system is perfectly observed, we find that RC is
vulnerable to observation sparsity compared with LETKF. To overcome this
limitation of RC, we propose to combine LETKF and RC. In our proposed method,
the system is predicted by RC that learned the analysis time series estimated
by LETKF. Our proposed method can successfully predict the Lorenz 96 system
using noisy and sparsely distributed observations. Most importantly, our method
can predict better than LETKF when the process-based model is imperfect.

The governing equations is derived using Lagrange Method. The effects of
nonlinear terms due to the large deformation, gravity, and tip-mass are
considered. Control inputs include forces and moment exerted at the joint
between slider and arm (see Fig. 1). The conventional computed torque control
laws cannot stabilize the system, since there are not as many control inputs as

used to obtain a suitable trajectory with the aim of minimizing excitations of

function, either to use a three-layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or to use
spline interpolation. A sliding mode control strategy is proposed in which the
sliding surfaces include elastic mode in order to guarantee robustness. The

and lower bounds for their arbitrage-free prices. We work in a completely
realistic setting, in that we only assume the knowledge of traded prices for
other single- and multi-asset derivatives, and even allow for the presence of
bid-ask spread in these prices. We provide a fundamental theorem of asset
pricing for this market model, as well as a superhedging duality result, that
allows to transform the abstract maximization problem over probability measures
into a more tractable minimization problem over vectors, subject to certain
constraints. Then, we recast this problem into a linear semi-infinite
optimization problem, and provide two algorithms for its solution. These
algorithms provide upper and lower bounds for the prices that are
$\varepsilon$-optimal, as well as a characterization of the optimal pricing
measures. These algorithms are efficient and allow the computation of bounds in
high-dimensional scenarios (e.g. when $d=60$). Moreover, these algorithms can
be used to detect arbitrage opportunities and identify the corresponding
arbitrage strategies. Numerical experiments using both synthetic and real
market data showcase the efficiency of these algorithms, while they also allow
to understand the reduction of model risk by including additional information,
in the form of known derivative prices.

via any two-body coupling inside a crystal of arbitrary dimension, is
considered. For simplicity and without loss of generality, a one-band model is
used to account for the electron-crystal interaction. The electron motion is
described in the Hilbert space $S_\phi$, spanned by a basis of Slater
determinants of one-electron Bloch wave-functions. Electron pairs of total
momentum $K$ and projected spin $\zeta=0,\pm1$ are considered in this work. The
hamiltonian then reads $H=H_D+\sum_{K,\zeta}H_{K,\zeta}$, where $H_D$ consists
of the diagonal part of $H$ in the Slater determinant basis. $H_{K,\zeta}$
describes the off-diagonal part of the two-electron scattering process which
conserves $K$ and $\zeta$. This hamiltonian operates in a subspace of $S_\phi$,

the public awareness and appreciation of the utility of dynamic models. At the
same time, the dissemination of contradictory model predictions has highlighted
their limitations. If some parameters and/or state variables of a model cannot
be determined from output measurements, its ability to yield correct insights
-- as well as the possibility of controlling the system -- may be compromised.
Epidemic dynamics are commonly analysed using compartmental models, and many
variations of such models have been used for analysing and predicting the
evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper we survey the different
models proposed in the literature, assembling a list of 36 model structures and
assessing their ability to provide reliable information. We address the problem
using the control theoretic concepts of structural identifiability and
observability. Since some parameters can vary during the course of an epidemic,
we consider both the constant and time-varying parameter assumptions. We
analyse the structural identifiability and observability of all of the models,
considering all plausible choices of outputs and time-varying parameters, which
leads us to analyse 255 different model versions. We classify the models
according to their structural identifiability and observability under the
different assumptions and discuss the implications of the results. We also
illustrate with an example several alternative ways of remedying the lack of
observability of a model. Our analyses provide guidelines for choosing the most
informative model for each purpose, taking into account the available knowledge

any other via a sequence of edge flips, as observed by Ito et al.
  We investigate the problem of determining, given two spanning trees $T_1,T_2$
with an additional property $\Pi$, if there exists an edge flip transformation
from $T_1$ to $T_2$ keeping property $\Pi$ all along.
  First we show that determining if there exists a transformation from $T_1$ to
$T_2$ such that all the trees of the sequence have at most $k$ (for any fixed
$k \ge 3$) leaves is PSPACE-complete.
  We then prove that determining if there exists a transformation from $T_1$ to

problems: (Sub-$k$-MP) $\min \sum_{i=1}^k f(S_i): S_1 \uplus S_2 \uplus \cdots
\uplus S_k = V \mbox{ and } S_i \neq \emptyset \mbox{ for all }i\in [k]$. Here
$f$ is a non-negative submodular function, and $\uplus$ denotes the union of
disjoint sets. Hence the goal is to partition $V$ into $k$ non-empty sets
$S_1,S_2,\ldots,S_k$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^k f(S_i)$ is minimized. These
problems were introduced by Zhao et al. partly motivated by applications to
network reliability analysis, VLSI design, hypergraph cut, and other
partitioning problems.
  In this work we revisit this class of problems and shed some light onto their
hardness of approximation in the value oracle model. We provide new
unconditional hardness results for Sub-$k$-MP in the special settings where the
function $f$ is either monotone or symmetric. For symmetric functions we show
that given any $\epsilon > 0$, any algorithm achieving a $(2 -
\epsilon)$-approximation requires exponentially many queries in the value
oracle model. For monotone objectives we show that given any $\epsilon > 0$,
any algorithm achieving a $(4/3 - \epsilon)$-approximation requires
exponentially many queries in the value oracle model.
  We then extend Sub-$k$-MP to a larger class of partitioning problems, where
the functions $f_i(S_i)$ can be different, and there is a more general
partitioning constraint $ S_1 \uplus S_2 \uplus \cdots \uplus S_k \in
\mathcal{F}$ for some family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq 2^V$ of feasible sets. We
provide a black box reduction that allows us to leverage several existing

the amplitude uncertainty (QRPN). In order to lower this quantum noise, GW
detectors plan to use squeezed light injection. In this thesis, I focus on
using radiation-pressure-mediated optomechanical (OM) interaction to generate
squeezed light. Creating squeezed states by using OM interaction enables
wavelength-independent squeezed light sources that may also be more compact and
robust than traditionally used non-linear crystals. We analyze the system with
realistic imperfections (losses & classical noise), and use the concepts to
design an experiment to obtain the most possible squeezing in a broad

optical properties of the cavity and the mechanical properties of the
oscillator. We then show its experimental implementation, and subsequent
observation of QRPN as well as OM squeezing. These are the first ever direct

vacuum fluctuations. This is shown in the low frequency band, which is relevant
to GW detectors, but poses its own technical challenges, and hence has not been

optical properties has also enabled us to observe OM squeezing. That is the

technique that generalizes the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier to
the case of distinct covariance matrices among classes. For the QDA classifier
to yield high classification performance, an accurate estimation of the
covariance matrices is required. Such a task becomes all the more challenging
in high dimensional settings, wherein the number of observations is comparable
with the feature dimension. A popular way to enhance the performance of QDA
classifier under these circumstances is to regularize the covariance matrix,
giving the name regularized QDA (R-QDA) to the corresponding classifier. In
this work, we consider the case in which the population covariance matrix has a
spiked covariance structure, a model that is often assumed in several
applications. Building on the classical QDA, we propose a novel quadratic
classification technique, the parameters of which are chosen such that the
fisher-discriminant ratio is maximized. Numerical simulations show that the
proposed classifier not only outperforms the classical R-QDA for both synthetic

process of evaluating, trialling and even implementing so-called immunity
passports. Also known as antibody or health certificates, there is a clear
demand for any technology that could allow people to return to work and other
crowded places without placing others at risk. One of the major criticisms of
such systems is that they could be misused to unfairly discriminate against
those without immunity, allowing the formation of an `immuno-privileged' class
of people. In this work we are motivated to explore an alternative technical

tokens -- randomised health certificates which, using methods from differential

useful aggregate risk estimates to be calculated. We show that health tokens
could mitigate immunity-based discrimination whilst still presenting a viable
mechanism for estimating the collective transmission risk posed by small groups

techniques that project nodes into feature spaces that can be exploited by
other machine learning algorithms. Since many real-world networks are
inherently dynamic, with interactions among nodes changing over time, these
techniques can be defined both for static and for time-varying graphs. Here, we
build upon the fact that the skip-gram embedding approach implicitly performs a
matrix factorization, and we extend it to perform implicit tensor factorization
on different tensor representations of time-varying graphs. We show that
higher-order skip-gram with negative sampling (HOSGNS) is able to disentangle
the role of nodes and time, with a small fraction of the number of parameters
needed by other approaches. We empirically evaluate our approach using
time-resolved face-to-face proximity data, showing that the learned
time-varying graph representations outperform state-of-the-art methods when
used to solve downstream tasks such as network reconstruction, and to predict
the outcome of dynamical processes such as disease spreading. The source code

Flux-closure magnetic patterns suggesting in-plane six-fold symmetry are

lack of magnetic memory upon thermal cycling. The domain walls presumably have
N\'eel texture, are preferentially oriented along directions separated by 120
degrees, and have a width of several tens of nanometers. Besides microscopic
mapping of magnetic domains and domain walls, the coercivity of the material is

describe a fundamental level of physical reality. Its mathematical core is the
causal action principle. In this thesis, we develop a formalism which connects
the causal action principle to a suitable notion of fields on space-time. We
derive field equations from the causal action principle and find that the
dynamics induced by the field equations conserve a symplectic form which gives
rise to an Hamiltonian time evolution if the causal fermion system admits a
notion of time. In this way, we establish the dynamics of causal fermion
systems. Remarkably, the causal action principle implies that there are
correction terms to the field equations, which we subsequently derive and
study. In particular, we prove that there is a stochastic and a non-linear
correction term and investigate how they relate to the Hamiltonian time
evolution. Furthermore, we give theorems which generalize the connection
between symmetries and conservation laws in Noether's theorems to the theory of
causal fermion systems. The appearance of the particular correction terms is
reminiscent of dynamical collapse models in quantum theory.

Hierarchical multi-species models outperformed all other methods under

off-chain Bitcoin transactions using peer-to-peer (P2P) channels between nodes
that can also be composed into a routing path. Although the resulting possible
channel graphs are well-studied, there is no empirical data on the network's
reliability in terms of being able to successfully route payments at a given
moment in time. In this paper we address this gap and investigate two forms of
availability that are a necessary ingredient to achieve such reliability. We
first study the Lightning network's ability to route payments of various sizes
to nearly every participating node, over most available channels. We establish
an inverse relationship between payment volume and success rate and show that
at best only about a third of destination nodes can be successfully reached.
The routing is hampered by a number of possible errors, both transient and
permanent. We then study the availability of nodes in the network
longitudinally and determine how long-lived they are. Churn in the network is
actually low, and a considerable number of nodes are hosted on cloud providers.
By testing node liveness, we find that the propagated network information is
relatively often stale, however, both for IP addresses and Tor onion addresses.
We provide recommendations how the Lightning network can be improved, including
considerations which trade-offs between privacy and decentralization on the one
hand and reliability on the other hand should at least be reconsidered by the
community developing the Lightning network.

  The result applies to both explicit regularization and to implicitly

derivatives were suggested in the literature: the Riemann-Liouville fractional
derivatives, the Caputo fractional derivatives, and the Hilfer fractional
derivatives. We clarify the interconnections between these derivatives on
different spaces of functions and provide some of their properties including
the formulas for their projectors and the Laplace transforms. However, it turns
out that there exist infinitely many other families of the fractional
derivatives that are the left-inverse operators to the Riemann-Liouville
fractional integrals. In this paper, we focus on an important class of these
fractional derivatives and discuss some of their properties.

obtain the full speedup allowed by stochastic updates, or require oracles that

Decentralized stochastic algorithm with Variance Reduction called DVR. DVR only
requires computing stochastic gradients of the local functions, and is
computationally as fast as a standard stochastic variance-reduced algorithms
run on a $1/n$ fraction of the dataset, where $n$ is the number of nodes. To
derive DVR, we use Bregman coordinate descent on a well-chosen dual problem,
and obtain a dual-free algorithm using a specific Bregman divergence. We give
an accelerated version of DVR based on the Catalyst framework, and illustrate
its effectiveness with simulations on real data.

extraction. Various types of autoencoders have been proposed by introducing
regularization terms. Most of these regularizations improve representation
learning by constraining the weights in the encoder part, which maps input into
hidden nodes and affects the generation of features. In this study, we show
that a constraint to the decoder can also significantly improve its performance
because the decoder determines how the latent variables contribute to the
reconstruction of input. Inspired by the structural modal analysis method in
mechanical engineering, a new modal autoencoder (MAE) is proposed by
othogonalising the columns of the readout weight matrix. The new regularization
helps to disentangle explanatory factors of variation and forces the MAE to
extract fundamental modes in data. The learned representations are functionally
independent in the reconstruction of input and perform better in consecutive
classification tasks. The results were validated on the MNIST variations and
USPS classification benchmark suite. Comparative experiments clearly show that
the new algorithm has a surprising advantage. The new MAE introduces a very
simple training principle for autoencoders and could be promising for the
pre-training of deep neural networks.

investigating the relationships between inner and outer planets plays a key

we present our results on the K-dwarf star BD-11~4672, already known to host a
long-period giant planet, as the first output of a subsample of the GAPS

of planets formed beyond the snowline by searching for Neptune-mass and
super-Earths planetary companions of known longer-period giants. The
high-precision HARPS-N observations of BD-11~4672 are used in conjunction with
literature time series in order to search for additional inner planetary
signals to be fitted using differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo. The
long-term stability of the new orbital solutions is tested by N-body dynamical
simulations. We report the detection of BD-11~4672~c, a new Neptune-mass planet
with an orbital period of $74.20_{-0.08}^{+0.06}\,\rm{d}$, eccentricity
$0.40_{-0.15}^{+0.13}$, semimajor axis $0.30\pm0.01\,\rm{au}$ and minimum mass

the optimistic circumstellar habitable zone. In order to assess its impact on
the dynamical stability of the habitable zone we compute the angular momentum
deficit of the system, showing that planet c has a severe negative impact on
the stability of possible additional lower-mass temperate planets. The
BD-11~4672 system is notable for its architecture, hosting both a long-period

Speed-of-sound images can be reconstructed from time-of-flight measurements

transducers. Variational Networks (VN) have recently been shown to be a
potential learning-based approach for optimizing inverse problems in image
reconstruction. Despite earlier promising results, these methods however do not
generalize well from simulated to acquired data, due to the domain shift. In
this work, we present for the first time a VN solution for a pulse-echo SoS
image reconstruction problem using diverging waves with conventional
transducers and single-sided tissue access. This is made possible by
incorporating simulations with varying complexity into training. We use loop
unrolling of gradient descent with momentum, with an exponentially weighted
loss of outputs at each unrolled iteration in order to regularize training. We
learn norms as activation functions regularized to have smooth forms for
robustness to input distribution variations. We evaluate reconstruction quality
on ray-based and full-wave simulations as well as on tissue-mimicking phantom
data, in comparison to a classical iterative (L-BFGS) optimization of this
image reconstruction problem. We show that the proposed regularization
techniques combined with multi-source domain training yield substantial
improvements in the domain adaptation capabilities of VN, reducing median RMSE
by 54% on a wave-based simulation dataset compared to the baseline VN. We also
show that on data acquired from a tissue-mimicking breast phantom the proposed
VN provides improved reconstruction in 12 milliseconds.

proxy is even more useful if its integral is known analytically and can be

different sizes N in comparison with the performance of other types of

DEWSPs provides an improvement rate of 0.24% to 5.15% in terms of monthly

using a purely data-driven approach rather than relying on the efforts of

2018). Considering that modeling phrases instead of words has significantly
improved the Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) approach through the use of
larger translation blocks (""phrases"") and its reordering ability, modeling NMT
at phrase level is an intuitive proposal to help the model capture
long-distance relationships. In this paper, we first propose an attentive
phrase representation generation mechanism which is able to generate phrase
representations from corresponding token representations. In addition, we
incorporate the generated phrase representations into the Transformer
translation model to enhance its ability to capture long-distance
relationships. In our experiments, we obtain significant improvements on the
WMT 14 English-German and English-French tasks on top of the strong Transformer
baseline, which shows the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach helps
Transformer Base models perform at the level of Transformer Big models, and
even significantly better for long sentences, but with substantially fewer
parameters and training steps. The fact that phrase representations help even
in the big setting further supports our conjecture that they make a valuable
contribution to long-distance relations.

light, enabling radical-free dissolution DNP. Although pyruvate is endogenous,
an excess of additional pyruvate may perturb metabolic processes, making it
potentially unsuitable as a polarizing agent when studying fatty acids or
carbohydrate metabolism. Therefore, the aim of the study was to characterize
solutions containing endogenously-occurring alternatives to pyruvate as
UV-induced nonpersistent radical precursors for in vivo hyperpolarized MRI. The
metabolites alpha-ketovalerate (AKV) and alpha-ketobutyrate (AKB) are analogues
of pyruvate and were chosen as potential radical precursors. Sample
formulations containing AKV and AKB were studied with UV-visible spectroscopy,
irradiated with UV light, and their nonpersistent radical yields were
quantified with ESR and compared to pyruvate. The addition of 13C labeled
substrates to the sample matrix altered the radical yield of the precursors.
Using AKB increased the 13C-labeled glucose liquid state polarization to 16.3
+/- 1.3% compared with 13.3 +/- 1.5% obtained with pyruvate, and 8.9 +/- 2.1%
with AKV. For [1-13C]butyric acid, polarization levels of 12.1 +/- 1.1% for AKV

for the protection against the health harms caused by solar ultraviolet (UV,
295 - 400 nm). The emphasis has been made upon the erythema as being the
best-studied UV harm and the ability of UV irradiance to damage the
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) molecules, which leads to carcinogenesis. The
erythemally weighted UV irradiance that determines the ultraviolet index (UVI),
represents a common measure of the solar UV radiation level at the Earth's
surface and the current protective messages have been made by using UVI as a
basic parameter. However, such an approach seems insufficiently grounded to be
used also in the messages against the skin cancer, bearing in mind the
different nature of the erythema and DNA lesions. In this context, an
enlargement of the strategy basis by including additional biological effects of
UV radiation studied during the past years has been discussed. For instance,
the weight of the spectral UV-A (315 - 400 nm) band that in practice had been
neglected by UVI definition can be enhanced since it was found to play an
important role in DNA damaging. In addition, features of the contemporaneous
life style can be taken into account together with some people habits.

demonstrate the ability of both algorithms to reconstruct the flow fields with
all the spatial and temporal frequencies necessary to support accurate noise
evaluation. Results show that while DMD is capable to capture finer coherent
structures in the wake region for the same amount of employed modes,
reconstructed flow fields using POD exhibit smaller magnitudes of global

can compete for resources yielding to severe slowdowns or failed executions.
Efficient job placement on environments where resources are shared requires
awareness on how jobs interfere during execution, to go far beyond ineffective
resource overbooking techniques. Current techniques, most of them already
involving machine learning and job modeling, are based on workload behavior
summarization across time, instead of focusing on effective job requirements at
each instant of the execution. In this work we propose a methodology for
modeling co-scheduling of jobs on data-centers, based on their behavior towards
resources and execution time, using sequence-to-sequence models based on
recurrent neural networks. The goal is to forecast co-executed jobs footprint
on resources along their execution time, from the profile shown by the
individual jobs, to enhance resource managers and schedulers placement
decisions. The methods here presented are validated using High Performance
Computing benchmarks based on different frameworks (like Hadoop and Spark) and
applications (CPU bound, IO bound, machine learning, SQL queries...).
Experiments show that the model can correctly identify the resource usage
trends from previously seen and even unseen co-scheduled jobs.

  Using Wearable Sensors",,,,,"cs.CV","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Human activity recognition (HAR) in ubiquitous computing has been beginning
to incorporate attention into the context of deep neural networks (DNNs), in
which the rich sensing data from multimodal sensors such as accelerometer and
gyroscope is used to infer human activities. Recently, two attention methods
are proposed via combining with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) network, which can capture the dependencies of sensing signals in
both spatial and temporal domains simultaneously. However, recurrent networks
often have a weak feature representing power compared with convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). On the other hand, two attention, i.e., hard attention and
soft attention, are applied in temporal domains via combining with CNN, which
pay more attention to the target activity from a long sequence. However, they
can only tell where to focus and miss channel information, which plays an
important role in deciding what to focus. As a result, they fail to address the
spatial-temporal dependencies of multimodal sensing signals, compared with
attention-based GRU or LSTM. In the paper, we propose a novel dual attention
method called DanHAR, which introduces the framework of blending channel
attention and temporal attention on a CNN, demonstrating superiority in
improving the comprehensibility for multimodal HAR. Extensive experiments on
four public HAR datasets and weakly labeled dataset show that DanHAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance with negligible overhead of parameters.
Furthermore, visualizing analysis is provided to show that our attention can
amplifies more important sensor modalities and timesteps during classification,
which agrees well with human common intuition.

those that implement a convolutional recurrent network (CRNN) having previously
transformed the audio signal into multichannel 2D representation. The
squeeze-excitation technique can be considered as a convolution enhancement
that aims to learn spatial and channel feature maps independently rather than
together as standard convolutions do. This is usually achieved by combining
some global clustering operators, linear operators and a final calibration
between the block input and its learned relationships. This work aims to
improve the accuracy results of the baseline CRNN presented in DCASE 2020 Task
3 by adding residual squeeze-excitation (SE) blocks in the convolutional part
of the CRNN. The followed procedure involves a grid search of the ratio

the hyperparameters of the network remain the same as in the baseline.

obtained are able to improve the baseline considerably.

modelling ontologies, i.e. knowledge about concepts and the relations between
them. Unfortunately, DL ontologies are difficult to learn from data and
time-consuming to encode manually. As a result, ontologies for broad domains
are almost inevitably incomplete. In recent years, several data-driven
approaches have been proposed for automatically extending such ontologies. One
family of methods rely on characterizations of concepts that are derived from
text descriptions. While such characterizations do not capture ontological
knowledge directly, they encode information about the similarity between
different concepts, which can be exploited for filling in the gaps in existing
ontologies. To this end, several inductive inference mechanisms have already
been proposed, but these have been defined and used in a heuristic fashion. In
this paper, we instead propose an inductive inference mechanism which is based
on a clear model-theoretic semantics, and can thus be tightly integrated with
standard deductive reasoning. We particularly focus on interpolation, a
powerful commonsense reasoning mechanism which is closely related to cognitive
models of category-based induction. Apart from the formalization of the
underlying semantics, as our main technical contribution we provide
computational complexity bounds for reasoning in EL with this interpolation
mechanism.

heavy overload to the existing cellular networks. Although the small cell has

interested in deploying numerous base stations (BSs) due to expensive
infrastructure construction and maintenance. The unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs) can provide the low-cost and quick deployment, which can support
high-quality line-of-sight communications and have become promising mobile BSs.
In this paper, we propose a quality-of-experience (QoE)-driven UAV-enabled
pseudo-analog wireless video broadcast scheme, which provides mobile video
broadcast services for ground users (GUs). Due to limited energy available in
UAV, the aim of the proposed scheme is to maximize the minimum peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of GUs' video reconstruction quality by jointly
optimizing the transmission power allocation strategy and the UAV trajectory.
Firstly, the reconstructed video quality at GUs is defined under the
constraints of the UAV's total energy and motion mechanism, and the proposed
scheme is formulated as a complex non-convex optimization problem. Then, the
optimization problem is simplified to obtain a tractable suboptimal solution
with the help of the block coordinate descent model and the successive convex
approximation model. Finally, the experimental results are presented to show
the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Specifically, the proposed scheme can
achieve over 1.6dB PSNR gains in terms of GUs' minimum PSNR, compared with the
state-of-the-art schemes, e.g., DVB, SoftCast, and SharpCast.

assumptions. Neural network models can learn directly from raw data, but they
struggle to capture compositional and causal structure and typically must
retrain to tackle new tasks. We bring together these two traditions to learn
generative models of concepts that capture rich compositional and causal
structure, while learning from raw data. We develop a generative neuro-symbolic
(GNS) model of handwritten character concepts that uses the control flow of a
probabilistic program, coupled with symbolic stroke primitives and a symbolic
image renderer, to represent the causal and compositional processes by which
characters are formed. The distributions of parts (strokes), and correlations
between parts, are modeled with neural network subroutines, allowing the model
to learn directly from raw data and express nonparametric statistical
relationships. We apply our model to the Omniglot challenge of human-level
concept learning, using a background set of alphabets to learn an expressive
prior distribution over character drawings. In a subsequent evaluation, our GNS
model uses probabilistic inference to learn rich conceptual representations
from a single training image that generalize to 4 unique tasks, succeeding
where previous work has fallen short.

$E\cap E_W=\emptyset$, the $(k,\gamma)$-spectral augmentability problem is to
find a set $F$ of $k$ edges from $E_W$ with appropriate weighting, such that
the algebraic connectivity of the resulting graph $H=(V,E\cup F)$ is least
$\gamma$. Because of a tight connection between the algebraic connectivity and
many other graph parameters, including the graph's conductance and the mixing
time of random walks in a graph, maximising the resulting graph's algebraic
connectivity by adding a small number of edges has been studied over the past
15 years.
  In this work we present an approximate and efficient algorithm for the
$(k,\gamma)$-spectral augmentability problem, and our algorithm runs in
almost-linear time under a wide regime of parameters. Our main algorithm is
based on the following two novel techniques developed in the paper, which might
have applications beyond the $(k,\gamma)$-spectral augmentability problem.
  (1) We present a fast algorithm for solving a feasibility version of an SDP
for the algebraic connectivity maximisation problem from [GB06]. Our algorithm
is based on the classic primal-dual framework for solving SDP, which in turn
uses the multiplicative weight update algorithm. We present a novel approach of
unifying SDP constraints of different matrix and vector variables and give a
good separation oracle accordingly.
  (2) We present an efficient algorithm for the subgraph sparsification
problem, and for a wide range of parameters our algorithm runs in almost-linear
time, in contrast to the previously best known algorithm running in at least
$\Omega(n^2mk)$ time [KMST10]. Our analysis shows how the randomised BSS
framework can be generalised in the setting of subgraph sparsification, and how
the potential functions can be applied to approximately keep track of different
subspaces.

relatively small number of neurons. It is found that for Xavier-like
initialization, there are two distinctive phases in the dynamic behavior of GD
in the under-parametrized regime: An early phase in which the GD dynamics
follows closely that of the corresponding random feature model and the neurons
are effectively quenched, followed by a late phase in which the neurons are
divided into two groups: a group of a few ""activated"" neurons that dominate the
dynamics and a group of background (or ""quenched"") neurons that support the
continued activation and deactivation process. This neural network-like
behavior is continued into the mildly over-parametrized regime, where it
undergoes a transition to a random feature-like behavior. The
quenching-activation process seems to provide a clear mechanism for ""implicit
regularization"". This is qualitatively different from the dynamics associated
with the ""mean-field"" scaling where all neurons participate equally and there
does not appear to be qualitative changes when the network parameters are

the task execution depends on the error in achieving the desired relative pose
between the peg and the hole in a pre-insertion configuration. Random actuation
errors in the joint space usually prevent the two arms from reaching their
desired task space poses, which in turn results in a random error in relative
pose between the two hands. This random error varies from trial to trial, and
thus depending on the tolerance between the peg and the hole, the outcome of
the assembly task may be random (sometimes the task execution succeeds and
sometimes it fails). In general, since the relative pose has $6$
degrees-of-freedom, there are infinite numbers of joint space solutions for the
two arms that correspond to the same task space relative pose. However, in the
presence of actuation errors, the joint space solutions are not all identical
since they map the joint space error sets differently to the task space. Thus,
the goal of this paper is to develop a methodical approach to compute a joint
space solution such that the maximum task space error is below a (specified)
threshold with high probability. Such a solution is called a robust inverse
kinematics solution for the bi-manual robot. Our proposed method also allows
the robot to self-evaluate whether it can perform a given bi-manual task

machine learning for partitioning complex data sets. The effectiveness of
spectral clustering stems from constructing a non-linear embedding based on
creating a similarity graph and computing the spectral decomposition of the
Laplacian matrix. However, spectral clustering methods fail to scale to large
data sets because of high computational cost and memory usage. A popular
approach for addressing these problems utilizes the Nystrom method, an
efficient sampling-based algorithm for computing low-rank approximations to
large positive semi-definite matrices. This paper demonstrates how the
previously popular approach of Nystrom-based spectral clustering has severe
limitations. Existing time-efficient methods ignore critical information by
prematurely reducing the rank of the similarity matrix associated with sampled
points. Also, current understanding is limited regarding how utilizing the
Nystrom approximation will affect the quality of spectral embedding
approximations. To address the limitations, this work presents a principled
spectral clustering algorithm that exploits spectral properties of the
similarity matrix associated with sampled points to regulate
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. We provide theoretical results to reduce the
current gap and present numerical experiments with real and synthetic data.
Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed
method compared to existing spectral clustering techniques based on the Nystrom
method and other efficient methods. The overarching goal of this work is to
provide an improved baseline for future research directions to accelerate
spectral clustering.

the line-of-sight component of the magnetic field from the photosphere to the

intergranular lanes in the photosphere and expand horizontally toward the
chromosphere, filling all the space and forming a canopy. Our results suggest
that the lower boundary of this canopy must be located around 400-600 km from
the photosphere. The mean canopy total magnetic field strength in the lower

  The mathematical tool to describe complex networks are random graph models.
We define a property of random graph models called
$\alpha$-power-law-boundedness. Roughly speaking, a random graph is
$\alpha$-power-law-bounded if it does not admit strong clustering and its
degree sequence is bounded by a power-law distribution with exponent at least
$\alpha$ (i.e. the fraction of vertices with degree $k$ is roughly
$O(k^{-\alpha})$).
  We solve the first-order model-checking problem (parameterized by the length
of the formula) in almost linear FPT time on random graph models satisfying
this property with $\alpha \ge 3$. This means in particular that one can solve
every problem expressible in first-order logic in almost linear expected time
on these random graph models. This includes for example preferential attachment
graphs, Chung-Lu graphs, configuration graphs, and sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi
graphs. Our results match known hardness results and generalize previous
tractability results on this topic.

Percolation theory quantifies the threshold value of a local control parameter
such as a node occupation (resp., deletion) probability or an edge activation
(resp., removal) probability above (resp., below) which there exists a giant
connected component (GCC), a connected component comprising of a number of
occupied nodes and active edges whose size is proportional to the size of the

one path comprised of active edges and occupied nodes. The mere existence of
the GCC itself does not guarantee that the long-range connectivity would be

  https://www.deepmimo.net/",,,,"eess.SP cs.IT math.IT","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Millimeter wave (mmWave) and massive MIMO systems are intrinsic components of
5G and beyond. These systems rely on using beamforming codebooks for both
initial access and data transmission. Current beam codebooks, however,
generally consist of a large number of narrow beams that scan all possible
directions, even if these directions are never used. This leads to very large
training overhead. Further, these codebooks do not normally account for the
hardware impairments or the possible non-uniform array geometries, and their
calibration is an expensive process. To overcome these limitations, this paper
develops an efficient online machine learning framework that learns how to
adapt the codebook beam patterns to the specific deployment, surrounding
environment, user distribution, and hardware characteristics. This is done by
designing a novel complex-valued neural network architecture in which the
neuron weights directly model the beamforming weights of the analog phase
shifters, accounting for the key hardware constraints such as the
constant-modulus and quantized-angles. This model learns the codebook beams
through online and self-supervised training avoiding the need for explicit
channel state information. This respects the practical situations where the
channel is either unavailable, imperfect, or hard to obtain, especially in the
presence of hardware impairments. Simulation results highlight the capability
of the proposed solution in learning environment and hardware aware beam
codebooks, which can significantly reduce the training overhead, enhance the
achievable data rates, and improve the robustness against possible hardware
impairments.

a Galactic magnetar, SGR 1935+2154, accompanied by an X-ray burst. We find this
radio burst challenges the typical emission mechanisms involving magnetars,
which includes coherent curvature radiation from charged bunches, fast
magnetosonic (FMS) wave, synchrotron maser from shocks, and the pulsar-like
mechanism for low-twist magnetars. More specifically, we find that (1) the
X-rays are most-likely to be produced inside the magnetosphere. (2) For the
coherent curvature radiation from the decay of Alfv\'en wave, it will generally
predict a duration ($\lesssim0.1$ ms) smaller than observations, because of the
strong twists of magnetic field lines and the internal damping of Alfv\'en
waves. (3) The FMS wave model predicts a very low emission frequency $\nu_{\rm
p}\sim0.03$ MHz $\ll$ GHz, unless it is produced inside the magnetosphere. But
the absorption effect of the magnetospheric FMS wave model remains to be
studied. (4) The synchrotron maser model is challenged, because observations
show that the peaks in both X-ray and radio light curves are with the same
temporal separation $\Delta t_{\rm FRB}=\Delta t_\gamma\approx0.03$ s, while it
would predict $\Delta t_{\rm FRB}\ll\Delta t_\gamma$. (5) It seems to be
difficult to directly apply the low-twist pulsar-like mechanism to flaring
magnetars, as magnetar activity can significantly deform the magnetosphere. (6)
We suggested four possibilities to study the general properties of FRBs for
future observations, especially the possibility of identifying quasi-periodic
oscillations with period $\sim1-10$ ms in double/multiple-peaked FRBs.

reuse code, as comments carry important domain knowledge. But current code
detection techniques ignore code comments, mainly due to the ambiguity of the
English language. Recent advances in information retrieval techniques may have
the potential to utilize code comments for clone detection. We investigated
this by empirically comparing the accuracy of detecting clones with solely
comments versus solely source code (without comments) on the JHotDraw package,
which contains 315 classes and 27K lines of code. To detect clones at the file
level, we used a topic modeling technique, Latent Dirichlet Allocation, to
analyze code comments and GRAPLE -- utilizing Program Dependency Graph -- to

Dirichlet Allocation and 28.7 recall and 55.39 precision using GRAPLE. We found
Latent Dirichlet Allocation generated false positives in cases where programs
lacked quality comments. But this limitation can be addressed by using a hybrid
approach: utilizing code comments at the file level to reduce the clone set and
then using Program Dependency Graph-based techniques at the method level to
detect precise clones. Our further analysis across Java and Python packages,
Java Swing and PyGUI, found a recall of 74.86\% and a precision of 84.21\%. Our

the existence of giant planet. The mass and eccentricity of the giant planet
may play a crucial role in shaping the final configuration of the system. The
inner planet pair can be trapped in 5:3 or 7:4 MMRs if the giant planet
revolves the central star with an eccentric orbit, which is similar to the

resilience depends both on net-wide measures of connectivity and the role of a
single component. This paper has two objectives: first to show how a set of
global measures can be obtained using techniques from network theory, in
particular how the spectral analysis of the adjacency and Laplacian matrices
and a similarity measure based on Jensen-Shannon divergence allows us to obtain
a characteriza-tion of global connectivity which is both mathematically sound
and operational. Second, how a clustering method in the subspace spanned by the
l smallest eigen-vectors of the Laplacian matrix allows us to identify the
edges of the network whose failure breaks down the network. Even if most of the

presentation of paired conditioned stimulus (tone) and unconditioned stimulus
(airpuff). The influence of various temporal recoding of granule cells on the
EBC is investigated in a cerebellar network where the connection probability
$p_c$ from Golgi to granule cells is changed. In an optimal case of
$p_c^*~(=0.029)$, individual granule cells show various well- and ill-matched
firing patterns relative to the unconditioned stimulus. Then, these
variously-recoded signals are fed into the Purkinje cells (PCs) through
parallel-fibers (PFs). In the case of well-matched PF-PC synapses, their
synaptic weights are strongly depressed through strong long-term depression
(LTD). On the other hand, practically no LTD occurs for the ill-matched PF-PC
synapses. This type of ""effective"" depression at the PF-PC synapses coordinates
firings of PCs effectively, which then make effective inhibitory coordination
on cerebellar nucleus neuron [which elicits conditioned response (CR;
eyeblink)]. When the learning trial passes a threshold, acquisition of CR
begins. In this case, the timing degree ${\cal T}_d$ of CR becomes good due to
presence of the ill-matched firing group which plays a role of protection
barrier for the timing. With further increase in the trial, strength $\cal S$
of CR (corresponding to the amplitude of eyelid closure) increases due to
strong LTD in the well-matched firing group. Thus, with increasing the learning
trial, the (overall) learning efficiency degree ${\cal L}_e$ (taking into
consideration both timing and strength of CR) for the CR is increased, and
eventually it becomes saturated. By changing $p_c$ from $p_c^*$, we also
investigate the influence of various temporal recoding on the EBC. It is thus
found that, the more various in temporal recoding, the more effective in
learning for the Pavlovian EBC.

they lack principled methods to process inputs with missing features or to
detect outliers, which requires pairing them with imputation techniques or a
separate generative model. In this paper, we demonstrate that DTs and RFs can
naturally be interpreted as generative models, by drawing a connection to
Probabilistic Circuits, a prominent class of tractable probabilistic models.
This reinterpretation equips them with a full joint distribution over the
feature space and leads to Generative Decision Trees (GeDTs) and Generative
Forests (GeFs), a family of novel hybrid generative-discriminative models. This
family of models retains the overall characteristics of DTs and RFs while
additionally being able to handle missing features by means of marginalisation.
Under certain assumptions, frequently made for Bayes consistency results, we
show that consistency in GeDTs and GeFs extend to any pattern of missing input
features, if missing at random. Empirically, we show that our models often
outperform common routines to treat missing data, such as K-nearest neighbour
imputation, and moreover, that our models can naturally detect outliers by
monitoring the marginal probability of input features.

negative current density, also known as the ""current hole"" setup. The
finite-element code FINMHD is used to solve a reduced set of incompressible
Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with a current-vorticity formulation.
First, the kink instability linearly develops in agreement with the general
theory of resistive internal kink mode, and it subsequently leads to the
formation of a current sheet. At relatively low Lundquist number $S$, a
magnetic reconnection process proceeds with a rate predicted by the
Sweet-Parker regime. Conversely, when $S$ exceeds a critical value that is $S_c
\simeq 10^4$, the current sheet is disrupted by the formation of plasmoids on a
slightly sub-Alfv\'enic time scale. In the latter case, a stochastic
reconnection regime exhibiting Petshek-type features enriched by plasmoids is
reached. A relatively fast normalized reconnection rate value of order $0.02$
is also measured. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained in
similar 2D previous studies using ideal MHD instabilities to initiate the
process, and discuss their relevance for the general theory of plasmoid chains
formation and associated fast reconnection regime.

jointly performs semantic and instance segmentation tasks. For semantic
segmentation task, inspired by the inherent correlation among objects in

explore the constructive effects of the semantic context information. For
instance segmentation task, different from previous works that utilize
clustering only in inference procedure, we propose a Salient Point Clustering
Optimization (SPCO) module to introduce a clustering procedure into the
training process and impel the network focusing on points that are difficult to
be distinguished. In addition, because of the inherent structures of indoor
scenes, the imbalance problem of the category distribution is rarely considered
but severely limits the performance of 3D scene perception. To address this
issue, we introduce an adaptive Water Filling Sampling (WFS) algorithm to
balance the category distribution of training data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on
benchmark datasets in both semantic segmentation and instance segmentation
tasks.

benefits. However, with the proliferation of the sharing economy, new
nonmotorized means of transport are entering the fold, complementing some
existing mobility options while competing with others. The purpose of this
research study is to investigate the adoption of three active travel modes;
namely walking, cycling and bikesharing, in a joint modeling framework. The
analysis is based on an adaptation of the stages of change framework, which
originates from the health behavior sciences. Multivariate ordered probit
modeling drawing on U.S. survey data provides well-needed insights into
individuals preparedness to adopt multiple active modes as a function of
personal, neighborhood and psychosocial factors. The research suggests three
important findings. 1) The joint model structure confirms interdependence among
different active mobility choices. The strongest complementarity is found for
walking and cycling adoption. 2) Each mode has a distinctive adoption path with
either three or four separate stages. We discuss the implications of derived
stage-thresholds and plot adoption contours for selected scenarios. 3)
Psychological and neighborhood variables generate more coupling among active
modes than individual and household factors. Specifically, identifying strongly
with active mobility aspirations, experiences with multimodal travel,
possessing better navigational skills, along with supportive local community
norms are the factors that appear to drive the joint adoption decisions. This
study contributes to the understanding of how decisions within the same
functional domain are related and help to design policies that promote active
mobility by identifying positive spillovers and joint determinants.

study, we analyzed 587 million tweets worldwide to see how global collaborative
efforts in reducing human mobility are reflected from the user-generated
information at the global, country, and the U.S. state scale. Considering the
multifaceted nature of mobility, we propose two types of distance: the
single-day distance and the cross-day distance. To quantify the responsiveness
in certain geographical regions, we further propose a mobility-based responsive
index (MRI) that captures the overall degree of mobility changes within a time
window. The results suggest that mobility patterns obtained from Twitter data
are amendable to quantitatively reflect the mobility dynamics. Globally, the
proposed two distances had greatly deviated from their baselines after March
11, 2020, when WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The considerably less
periodicity after the declaration suggests that the protection measures have
obviously affected people's travel routines. The country scale comparisons
reveal the discrepancies in responsiveness, evidenced by the contrasting
mobility patterns in different epidemic phases. We find that the triggers of
mobility changes correspond well with the national announcements of mitigation
measures. In the U.S., the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility is
distinct. However, the impacts varied substantially among states. The strong
mobility recovering momentum is further fueled by the Black Lives Matter
protests, potentially fostering the second wave of infections in the U.S.

we obtain EOM of special relativity in classical mechanics. These are for PKE
systems. From negative kinetic energy (NKE) Schrodinger equation and decoupled
Klein-Gordon equation, the EOM describing low momentum and relativistic motions
of macroscopic dark bodies are derived. These are NKE systems, i. e., dark
systems. In all cases scalar and vector potentials are also taken into account.
The formalism obtained is collectively called macromechanics. For an isolated
system containing PKE and NKE bodies, both total momentum and total kinetic
energy are conserved. A dark ideal gas produces a negative pressure, and its
microscopic mechanism is disclosed. Two-body problems, where at least one is of
NKE, are investigated for both macroscopic bodies and microscopic particles. A
NKE proton and a PKE electron can compose a stable PKE atom, and its spectral
lines have blue shifts compared to a hydrogen atom. The author suggests to seek
for these spectral lines in celestial spectra. This provides a way to seek for
dark particles in space. Elastic collisions between a body and a dark body are

world and has a significant impact on public healthcare. Due to rising
skepticism towards the sensitivity of RT-PCR as screening method, medical
imaging like computed tomography offers great potential as alternative. For
this reason, automated image segmentation is highly desired as clinical
decision support for quantitative assessment and disease monitoring. However,
publicly available COVID-19 imaging data is limited which leads to overfitting
of traditional approaches. To address this problem, we propose an innovative
automated segmentation pipeline for COVID-19 infected regions, which is able to
handle small datasets by utilization as variant databases. Our method focuses
on on-the-fly generation of unique and random image patches for training by
performing several preprocessing methods and exploiting extensive data
augmentation. For further reduction of the overfitting risk, we implemented a
standard 3D U-Net architecture instead of new or computational complex neural
network architectures. Through a 5-fold cross-validation on 20 CT scans of
COVID-19 patients, we were able to develop a highly accurate as well as robust
segmentation model for lungs and COVID-19 infected regions without overfitting
on the limited data. Our method achieved Dice similarity coefficients of 0.956
for lungs and 0.761 for infection. We demonstrated that the proposed method
outperforms related approaches, advances the state-of-the-art for COVID-19
segmentation and improves medical image analysis with limited data. The code
and model are available under the following link:

  Functions","10 pages",,,,"q-bio.BM cs.LG q-bio.QM stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Computer-aided drug discovery is an essential component of modern drug
development. Therein, deep learning has become an important tool for rapid
screening of billions of molecules in silico for potential hits containing
desired chemical features. Despite its importance, substantial challenges
persist in training these models, such as severe class imbalance, high decision
thresholds, and lack of ground truth labels in some datasets. In this work we
argue in favor of directly optimizing the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) in such cases, due to its robustness to class imbalance, its ability to
compromise over different decision thresholds, certain freedom to influence the
relative weights in this compromise, fidelity to typical benchmarking measures,
and equivalence to positive/unlabeled learning. We also propose new training
schemes (coherent mini-batch arrangement, and usage of out-of-batch samples)
for cost functions based on the ROC, as well as a cost function based on the
logAUC metric that facilitates early enrichment (i.e. improves performance at
high decision thresholds, as often desired when synthesizing predicted hit
compounds). We demonstrate that these approaches outperform standard deep
learning approaches on a series of PubChem high-throughput screening datasets
that represent realistic and diverse drug discovery campaigns on major drug
target families.

the Workshop section of NeurIPS 2019. As organizers of the workshop, we created
the following report in an attempt to isolate emerging topics and recurring
themes that have been presented throughout the event. Deep learning can still
be a complex mix of art and engineering despite its tremendous success in
recent years. The workshop aimed at gathering people across the board to
address seemingly contrasting challenges in the problems they are working on.
As part of the call for the workshop, particular attention has been given to
the interdependence of architecture, data, and optimization that gives rise to
an enormous landscape of design and performance intricacies that are not
well-understood. This year, our goal was to emphasize the following directions
in our community: (i) identify obstacles in the way to better models and
algorithms; (ii) identify the general trends from which we would like to build
scientific and potentially theoretical understanding; and (iii) the rigorous
design of scientific experiments and experimental protocols whose purpose is to
resolve and pinpoint the origin of mysteries while ensuring reproducibility and
robustness of conclusions. In the event, these topics emerged and were broadly
discussed, matching our expectations and paving the way for new studies in
these directions. While we acknowledge that the text is naturally biased as it
comes through our lens, here we present an attempt to do a fair job of
highlighting the outcome of the workshop.

  signals",,,,,"eess.SP cs.AI cs.CV cs.LG eess.IV","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","  In previous studies, decoding electroencephalography (EEG) signals has not
considered the topological relationship of EEG electrodes. However, the latest
neuroscience has suggested brain network connectivity. Thus, the exhibited
interaction between EEG channels might not be appropriately measured via
Euclidean distance. To fill the gap, an attention-based graph residual network,
a novel structure of Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN), was presented to
detect human motor intents from raw EEG signals, where the topological
structure of EEG electrodes was built as a graph. Meanwhile, deep residual
learning with a full-attention architecture was introduced to address the
degradation problem concerning deeper networks in raw EEG motor imagery (MI)
data. Individual variability, the critical and longstanding challenge
underlying EEG signals, has been successfully handled with the state-of-the-art
performance, 98.08% accuracy at the subject level, 94.28% for 20 subjects.
Numerical results were promising that the implementation of the
graph-structured topology was superior to decode raw EEG data. The innovative
deep learning approach was expected to entail a universal method towards both
neuroscience research and real-world EEG-based practical applications, e.g.,
seizure prediction.
