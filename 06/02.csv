data, called OrdNMF. Ordinal data are categorical data which exhibit a natural
ordering between the categories. In particular, they can be found in
recommender systems, either with explicit data (such as ratings) or implicit
data (such as quantized play counts). OrdNMF is a probabilistic latent factor
model that generalizes Bernoulli-Poisson factorization (BePoF) and Poisson
factorization (PF) applied to binarized data. Contrary to these methods, OrdNMF
circumvents binarization and can exploit a more informative representation of
the data. We design an efficient variational algorithm based on a suitable
model augmentation and related to variational PF. In particular, our algorithm
preserves the scalability of PF and can be applied to huge sparse datasets. We
report recommendation experiments on explicit and implicit datasets, and show
that OrdNMF outperforms BePoF and PF applied to binarized data.

financial institutions share risk by exchanging contingent convertible (CoCo)

converts continuously when a bank's equity-debt ratio drops to a trigger level.
The main theoretical result is a complete characterization of the clearing

We then introduce stylized networks to study when introducing contingent

for which contingent convertible bonds do not provide uniformly improved system

network at the time of the 2011 EBA stress test to do comparative statics to

captures the properties of the Universe on a Gpc scale while achieving a
resolution of 1kpc. Inside the simulation box we zoom-in on a high-resolution
cuboid region with a volume of $1049\times114\times114\,{\rm cMpc}^3$.The
sub-grid physics chosen to model galaxy formation includes radiative
heating/cooling, UV background, star formation, supernova feedback, chemical
evolution tracking the enrichment of oxygen and iron, the growth of
supermassive black holes and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the
form of a dual jet-heating mode. For this simulation we implemented a hybrid
MPI-OMP version of RAMSES, specifically targeted for modern many-core many
thread parallel architectures. In addition to the traditional simulation
snapshots, light-cone data was generated on the fly. For the post-processing,
we extended the Friends-of-Friend (FoF) algorithm and developed a new galaxy
finder PGalF to analyse the outputs of HR5. The simulation successfully
reproduces observations, such as the cosmic star formation history and
connectivity of galaxy distribution, We identify cosmological structures at a
wide range of scales, from filaments with a length of several cMpc, to voids
with a radius of ~100 cMpc. The simulation also indicates that hydrodynamical
effects on small scales impact galaxy clustering up to very large scales near
and beyond the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale. Hence, caution should
be taken when using that scale as a cosmic standard ruler: one needs to
carefully understand the corresponding biases. The simulation is expected to be
an invaluable asset for the interpretation of upcoming deep surveys of the
Universe.

such attack that has attracted a great deal of attention recently is the
backdoor attack. Specifically, the adversary poisons the target model's

  Previous backdoor attacks predominantly focus on computer vision (CV)
applications, such as image classification. In this paper, we perform a
systematic investigation of backdoor attack on NLP models, and propose BadNL, a
general NLP backdoor attack framework including novel attack methods.
Specifically, we propose three methods to construct triggers, namely BadChar,
BadWord, and BadSentence, including basic and semantic-preserving variants. Our
attacks achieve an almost perfect attack success rate with a negligible effect
on the original model's utility. For instance, using the BadChar, our backdoor
attack achieves a 98.9% attack success rate with yielding a utility improvement
of 1.5% on the SST-5 dataset when only poisoning 3% of the original set.

face images from freehand sketches. However, existing solutions tend to overfit
to sketches, thus requiring professional sketches or even edge maps as input.
To address this issue, our key idea is to implicitly model the shape space of
plausible face images and synthesize a face image in this space to approximate
an input sketch. We take a local-to-global approach. We first learn feature
embeddings of key face components, and push corresponding parts of input
sketches towards underlying component manifolds defined by the feature vectors
of face component samples. We also propose another deep neural network to learn
the mapping from the embedded component features to realistic images with
multi-channel feature maps as intermediate results to improve the information
flow. Our method essentially uses input sketches as soft constraints and is
thus able to produce high-quality face images even from rough and/or incomplete
sketches. Our tool is easy to use even for non-artists, while still supporting
fine-grained control of shape details. Both qualitative and quantitative
evaluations show the superior generation ability of our system to existing and
alternative solutions. The usability and expressiveness of our system are
confirmed by a user study.

For the considered application, the selected parameters are related to the
mechanism's elasticities and mass distribution. Notably, we show that it is
possible to reach a desirable trade-off between mass reduction and periodic

to public health, the real economy, and human well-being. With the absence of
effective vaccines, the preventive actions of social distancing and travel
reduction are recognized as essential non-pharmacologic approaches to control
the spread of COVID-19. Prior studies demonstrated that human movement and
mobility drove the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 in China. Little is
known, however, about the patterns and effects of co-location reduction on
cross-county transmission risk of COVID-19. This study utilizes Facebook
co-location data for all counties in the United States from March to early May
2020. The analysis examines the synchronicity and time lag between travel
reduction and pandemic growth trajectory to evaluate the efficacy of social
distancing in ceasing the population co-location probabilities, and
subsequently the growth in weekly new cases. The results show that the
mitigation effects of co-location reduction appear in the growth of weekly new
cases with one week of delay. Furthermore, significant segregation is found
among different county groups which are categorized based on numbers of cases.
The results suggest that within-group co-location probabilities remain stable,
and social distancing policies primarily resulted in reduced cross-group
co-location probabilities (due to travel reduction from counties with large
number of cases to counties with low numbers of cases). These findings could
have important practical implications for local governments to inform their
intervention measures for monitoring and reducing the spread of COVID-19, as
well as for adoption in future pandemics. Public policy, economic forecasting,
and epidemic modeling need to account for population co-location patterns in
evaluating transmission risk of COVID-19 across counties.

computation~\cite{PRA79062318,PRL112120504}. However, in present
state-of-the-art techniques~\cite{PRA90060302,PRL106240504}, the fidelity of
such gates is ultimately limited by the need to create squeezed vacuum modes of
unbounded energy. Here we circumvent this fundamental limitation by using a
heralded squeezing gate. We propose and experimentally demonstrate a squeezing
gate that can achieve near unit fidelity for coherent input states. In
particular, for a target squeezing of \SI{2.3}{\dB}, we report a fidelity of
\SI{98.5}{\%}. This result cannot be reproduced by conventional schemes even if
the currently best available squeezing of \SI{15}{\dB}~\cite{PRL117110801} is
utilised when benchmarked on identical detection inefficiencies. Our technique
can be applied to non-Gaussian states and provides a promising pathway towards
high-fidelity gate operations and fault-tolerant quantum computation.

k bits, while minimizing the information loss?
  Large-scale graphs have become omnipresent, posing considerable computational
challenges. Analyzing such large graphs can be fast and easy if they are
compressed sufficiently to fit in main memory or even cache. Graph
summarization, which yields a coarse-grained summary graph with merged nodes,
stands out with several advantages among graph compression techniques. Thus, a
number of algorithms have been developed for obtaining a concise summary graph
with little information loss or equivalently small reconstruction error.
However, the existing methods focus solely on reducing the number of nodes, and
they often yield dense summary graphs, failing to achieve better compression
rates. Moreover, due to their limited scalability, they can be applied only to
moderate-size graphs.
  In this work, we propose SSumM, a scalable and effective graph-summarization
algorithm that yields a sparse summary graph. SSumM not only merges nodes
together but also sparsifies the summary graph, and the two strategies are
carefully balanced based on the minimum description length principle. Compared
with state-of-the-art competitors, SSumM is (a) Concise: yields up to 11.2X
smaller summary graphs with similar reconstruction error, (b) Accurate:
achieves up to 4.2X smaller reconstruction error with similarly concise
outputs, and (c) Scalable: summarizes 26X larger graphs while exhibiting linear
scalability. We validate these advantages through extensive experiments on 10
real-world graphs.

data within 10 minutes (~3200 proton gyroradii upstream, ~1900 downstream) of
the shock ramp. A perturbed shock is defined as possessing a large amplitude
whistler precursor in the quasi-static magnetic field with an amplitude greater
than 1/3 the difference between the upstream and downstream average magnetic
field magnitudes; laminar shocks lack these large precursors and have a smooth,
step function-like transition. In addition to wave modes previously observed,
including ion acoustic, whistler, and electrostatic solitary waves, waves in
the ion acoustic frequency range that show rapid temporal frequency change are
common. The ramp region of the two laminar shocks with burst data in the ramp
contained a wide range of large amplitude wave modes whereas the one perturbed
shock with ramp burst data contained no such waves. Energy dissipation through
wave-particle interactions is more prominent in these laminar shocks than the
perturbed shock. The wave occurrence rates for laminar shocks are higher in the
transition region, especially the ramp, than downstream. Perturbed shocks have
approximately 2-3 times the wave occurrence rate downstream than laminar
shocks.

detected 96 new and distinct bugs (62 crash and 34 semantic), which we
confirmed with the respective compiler developers. 54 have been fixed (31 crash

ordinal and there is an elementary embedding $j:L(V_{\lambda+1})\to
L(V_{\lambda+1})$ with critical point ${<\lambda}$. This hypothesis is usually
studied assuming ZFC holds in the full universe $V$, but we assume only ZF.
  We show, assuming ZF+$I_{0,\lambda}$, that there is a proper class transitive
inner model $M$ containing $V_{\lambda+1}$ and modelling the theory \[
\mathrm{ZF}+I_{0,\lambda}+\text{""there is an elementary embedding
}j:V_{\lambda+2}\to V_{\lambda+2}\text{""}.\] By employing the results of the
papers \emph{Periodicity in the cumulative hierarchy} and \emph{Even ordinals
and the Kunen inconsistency}, we also show that this generalizes to all even
ordinals $\lambda$.
  In the case that $\lambda$ is a limit and $\lambda$-DC holds in $V$, then the
model $M$ constructed also satisfies $\lambda$-DC.
  We also show that if ZFC+$I_{0,\lambda}$ is consistent, then it does not
imply the existence of $V_{\lambda+1}^\#$.
  Likewise, if ZF+""$\lambda$ is an even ordinal and $j:L(V_{\lambda+1})\to
L(V_{\lambda+1})$ is elementary with critical point ${<\lambda}$"" is
consistent, then it does not imply the existence of $V_{\lambda+1}^\#$. We show
that, however, this theory does imply that $A^\#$ exists for every $A\in
V_{\lambda+1}$.
  We also make some further obserations on $L(V_{\lambda+1})$ under such
hypotheses.

Concretely, we derive the geodesic equation of photons on such backgrounds.
Thanks to the Gauss-Bonnet theorem corresponding to the optical metric, we
compute the leading terms of the deflection angle in the so-called weak-limit
approximation. After that, we inspect the effect of DE and the space-time
dimension d on the calculated optical quantities. Introducing DE via the field
intensity c and the state parameter \omega, we find that the shadow size and
the deflection angle increase by increasing values of the field intensity c.
However, we observe that the high dimensions decrease such quantities for
\omega-models exhibiting similar behaviors. Then, we consider the effect of the
black hole charge, on these optical quantities, by discussing the associated
behaviors. The present investigation recovers certain known results appearing

approximately linear dependence of radio on X-ray luminosity in the sources

significantly deviated from the theoretical prediction of accretion flow as the
origin of X-ray emission. In contrast to radio-quiet quasars, there is no
significant correlation between $\Gamma$ and Eddington ratio. Our results seem
to indicate that the X-ray emission of high-accreting young radio AGNs may be
from jet. We constructed the SEDs for 18 sources (most are in radiative
efficient accretion) including 9 galaxies and 9 quasars with high-quality X-ray
data, and find that the X-ray emission of most quasars is more luminous than
that of normal radio-quiet quasars. This is clearly seen from the quasar
composite SED, of which the X-ray emission is apparently higher than that of
radio-quiet quasars, likely supporting the jet-related X-ray emission in young
radio AGNs. The scenario that the X-ray emission is from self-synchrotron

proper subtitles. Creating proper subtitles in terms of timing and segmentation
highly depends on information present in the audio (utterance duration, natural

  Lebesgue spaces","Added appendix on sharpness for complex-valued integral kernels",,,,"math.FA","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Schur's test states that if $K:X\times Y\to\mathbb{C}$ satisfies $\int_Y
|K(x,y)|d\nu(y)\leq C$ and $\int_X |K(x,y)|d\mu(x)\leq C$, then the associated
integral operator acts boundedly on $L^p$ for all $p\in [1,\infty]$. We derive
a variant of this result ensuring boundedness on the (weighted) mixed-norm
Lebesgue spaces $L_w^{p,q}$ for all $p,q\in [1,\infty]$. For non-negative
integral kernels our criterion is sharp; i.e., it is satisfied if and only if
the integral operator acts boundedly on all of the mixed-norm Lebesgue spaces.
  Motivated by this criterion, we introduce solid Banach modules
$\mathcal{B}_m(X,Y)$ of integral kernels such that all kernels in
$\mathcal{B}_m(X,Y)$ map $L_w^{p,q}(\nu)$ boundedly into $L_v^{p,q}(\mu)$ for
all $p,q \in [1,\infty]$, provided that the weights $v,w$ are $m$-moderate.
Conversely, if $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are solid Banach spaces for which
all kernels $K\in\mathcal{B}_m(X,Y)$ map $\mathbf{A}$ into $\mathbf{B}$, then
$\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are related to mixed-norm Lebesgue-spaces; i.e.,
$\left(L^1\cap L^\infty\cap L^{1,\infty}\cap
L^{\infty,1}\right)_v\hookrightarrow\mathbf{B}$ and
$\mathbf{A}\hookrightarrow\left(L^1 + L^\infty + L^{1,\infty} +
L^{\infty,1}\right)_{1/w}$ for certain weights $v,w$ depending on the weight
$m$.
  The kernel algebra $\mathcal{B}_m(X,X)$ is particularly suited for
applications in (generalized) coorbit theory: Usually, a host of technical
conditions need to be verified to guarantee that coorbit space theory is
applicable for a given continuous frame $\Psi$ and a Banach space $\mathbf{A}$.
We show that it is enough to check that certain integral kernels associated to
$\Psi$ belong to $\mathcal{B}_m(X,X)$; this ensures that the coorbit spaces
$\operatorname{Co}_\Psi (L_\kappa^{p,q})$ are well-defined for all $p,q\in
[1,\infty]$ and all weights $\kappa$ compatible with $m$.

outflow tracer consistently for all outflows in NGC 1333. We finally measure
the water abundance in outflows with respect to carbon monoxide and molecular
hydrogen. CO and H$_2$ are highly excited around B-stars and at lower levels
trace protostellar outflows. H$_2$O emission is dominated by a moderately fast
component associated with outflows. Intermediate J CO lines appear brightest at
the locations traced by a narrow H$_2$O component, indicating that beyond the
dominating collisional processes, a secondary, radiative excitation component
can also be active. The morphology, kinematics, excitation and abundance
variations of water are consistent with its excitation and partial dissociation
in shocks. Water abundance ranges between 5 x 10$^{-7}$ and 10$^{-5}$, with the
lower values being more representative. Water is brightest and most abundant
around IRAS 4A which is consistent with the latter hosting a hot corino source.
Finally, the outflow mass flux is found highest for CO and decreases by one and

nucleus Centaurus A (Cen A). Combined high-resolution observations with the
ALMA and Chandra observatories indicate that the hot X-ray emitting plasma
coexists with the warm and cold media in Cen A. This complex environment is a
source of CO lines with great impact for its diagnostics. We present the images
from the two above-mentioned instruments covering the nuclear region (diameter
of 10'' i.e., ~180 pc), and we study the conditions for plasma thermal
equilibrium and possible coexistence of cool clouds embedded within the hot
X-ray emitting gas. Further, we demonstrate that the multi-phase medium
originates naturally by the thermal instability (TI) arising due to the
interaction of the high-energy radiation field from the nucleus with the
ambient gas and dust. We demonstrate that cold gas clouds can coexist in the
mutual contact with hot plasma, but even colder dusty molecular clouds have to
be distanced by several hundred pc from the hot region. Finally, we propose a
3-D model of the appearance of the hot plasma and the CO line-emitting regions
consistent with the Chandra image and we derive the integrated emissivity in
specific molecular lines observed by ALMA from this model. To reproduce the
observed images and the CO line luminosity the dusty shell has to be ~420 pc
thick and located at ~1000 pc from the centre.

covering a more than three year baseline. We find that K2-32 is a compact
scaled-down version of the Solar System's architecture, with a small rocky
inner planet (M$_e=2.1^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$~M$_{\oplus}$, P$_e\sim4.35$~days)

smaller than M$_b<11.3$ M$_{\oplus}$ (P$_b\sim2.47$~days), M$_c<12.8$

is optimal in that $j$ is not definable from any parameter which is an element

infrastructure into isolated virtual networks (slices), managed by Service
Providers to accommodate customized services. The Service Function Chains
(SFCs) belonging to a slice are usually deployed on a best-effort premise:
nothing guarantees that network infrastructure resources will be sufficient to
support a varying number of users, each with uncertain requirements. Taking the
perspective of a network Infrastructure Provider (InP), this paper proposes a
resource provisioning approach for slices, robust to a partly unknown number of
users with random usage of the slice resources. The provisioning scheme aims to
maximize the total earnings of the InP, while providing a probabilistic
guarantee that the amount of provisioned network resources will meet the slice
requirements. Moreover, the proposed provisioning approach is performed so as
to limit its impact on low-priority background services, which may co-exist
with slices in the infrastructure network. A Mixed Integer Linear Programming
formulation of the slice resource provisioning problem is proposed. Optimal
joint and suboptimal sequential solutions are proposed. These solutions are
compared to a provisioning scheme that does not account for best-effort
services sharing the common infrastructure network.

of gradient trajectories. It is in this context that this paper puts forth a
rigorous geometric analysis of the gradient-descent method around strict-saddle

result that can be used to generate an approximate gradient trajectory for any

solution for gradient-descent method under certain necessary initial
conditions, which explicitly bring out the dependence on problem dimension,
conditioning of the saddle neighborhood, and more, for a class of strict-saddle

`consistent' with the data collected is constructed. The criterion of
consistency is based on the total squared error of that the model incurs on the
task of predicting \emph{values} as determined by the last value estimate along
the transitions. The next value function is then chosen by solving the
optimistic planning problem with the constructed set of models. We derive a
bound on the regret, which, in the special case of linear mixtures, the regret
bound takes the form $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{H^{3}T})$, where $H$, $T$ and
$d$ are the horizon, total number of steps and dimension of $\theta$,

shell, topological constraints arise with intriguing consequences that depend
critically on how the LC is aligned in the shell. We demonstrate reversible
dynamic tuning of the alignment, and thereby the topology, of nematic LC shells
stabilized by the nonionic amphiphilic block copolymer Pluronic F127. Deep in
the nematic phase, the director is tangential to the interface, but upon
approaching the temperature TNI of the nematic-isotropic transition, the
director realigns to normal. We link this to a delicate interplay between an
interfacial tension that is nearly independent of director orientation, and the
configuration-dependent elastic deformation energy of an LC confined in a
shell. The process is primarily triggered by the heating-induced reduction of
the nematic order parameter, hence realignment temperatures differ by several
tens of degrees between LCs with high and low TNI, respectively. The
temperature of realignment is always lower on the positive-curved shell outside
than at the negative-curved inside, yielding a complex topological
reconfiguration on heating. Complementing experimental investigations with
mathematical modeling and computer simulations, we identify and investigate
three different trajectories, distinguished by their configurations of
topological defects in the initial tangential-aligned shell. Our results
uncover a new aspect of the complex response of LCs to curved confinement,
demonstrating that the order of the LC itself can influence the alignment and
thereby the topology of the system. They also reveal the potential of
amphiphilic block copolymer stabilizers for enabling continuous tunability of
LC shell configuration, opening doors for in-depth studies of topological
dynamics as well as novel applications in, e.g., sensing and programmed soft

provide accurate collision probability estimates for a wide variety of motion
models but are cumbersome in the context of continuous optimization. On the
other, ""direct"" approximations aim to compute (or upper-bound) the failure
probability as a smooth function of the decision variables, and thus are
convenient for optimization. However, existing direct approaches fundamentally
assume discrete-time dynamics and can perform unpredictably when applied to
continuous-time systems ubiquitous in the real world, often manifesting as
severe conservatism. State-of-the-art attempts to address this within a
conventional discrete-time framework require additional Gaussianity
approximations that ultimately produce inconsistency of their own. In this

framework directly in continuous time and producing a lightweight estimate that
actually converges as the underlying discretization is refined. Our

study of \ion{H}{ii} regions in the SDSS to AGN, we adapt methods for computing
direct-method chemical abundances for application to the narrow-line regions

completely estimate the total oxygen abundance. We find a strong correlation
between electron temperature and oxygen abundance due to collisional cooling by
metals. Furthermore, we find that nitrogen and oxygen abundances in AGN are
strongly correlated. From the metal-temperature relation and the coupling of
nitrogen and oxygen abundances, we develop a new, empirically and physically
motivated method for determining chemical abundances from the strong emission
lines commonly employed in flux-ratio diagnostic diagrams (BPT diagrams). Our
approach, which for AGN reduces to a single equation based on the BPT line
ratios, consistently recovers direct-method abundances over a 1.5 dex range in
oxygen abundance with an rms uncertainty of 0.18 dex. We have determined

to the classification of equilibrium states of matter into universality
classes, is an outstanding problem in physics. Any many-body system, from
stellar matter to financial markets, can be out of equilibrium in a myriad of
ways; since many are also difficult to experiment on, it is a major goal to
establish universal principles that apply to different phenomena and physical
systems. At the heart of the classification of equilibrium states is the
universality seen in the self-similar spatial scaling of systems close to phase
transitions. Recent theoretical work, and first experimental evidence, suggest
that isolated many-body systems far from equilibrium generically exhibit
dynamic (spatiotemporal) self-similar scaling, akin to turbulent cascades and
the Family-Vicsek scaling in classical surface growth. Here we observe
bidirectional dynamic scaling in an isolated quench-cooled atomic Bose gas; as
the gas thermalises and undergoes Bose-Einstein condensation, it shows
self-similar net flows of particles towards the infrared (smaller momenta) and
energy towards the ultraviolet (smaller lengthscales). For both infrared (IR)
and ultraviolet (UV) dynamics we find that the scaling exponents are
independent of the strength of the interparticle interactions that drive the
thermalisation.

regarding the forces exerted on a body moving through such a fluid in two
dimensions. It is argued that acceleration of the body corresponds to vorticity
generation that is independent of the instantaneous velocity of the body and
thus the boundary condition on the normal velocity. The strength of the vortex
sheet representing the body retains a degree of freedom that represents the net
effect of the tangential boundary condition associated with the viscous flow
governed by the higher-order Navier-Stokes equations. This degree of freedom is
the circulation of the vorticity generated by the acceleration of the body.
Equivalently, it is the net circulation around a contour enclosing the body and
any shed vorticity. In accordance with Kelvin's circulation theorem, a non-zero
value of the circulation around this system is necessarily communicated to
infinity. This contrasts with the usual acceptance of the theorem as requiring
this circulation to be zero at all times; a condition that is incapable of
capturing the effect of newly generated vorticity on the body surface when it
accelerates. Additionally, the usual boundary condition of continuity of normal
velocity is relaxed to allow for fluid entrainment into surfaces of
discontinuity that represent the mass contained within the viscous layers of
the physical problem. The generalized force calculation is presented in detail.
The importance of the vorticity generation due to body acceleration is
demonstrated on some modeled problems relevant to biological propulsion.

Simultaneously the most recent results for $K^+\rightarrow\pi^+\nu\bar\nu$ from

fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) without magnetic order. A critical 'ghost'
Fermi surface emerges (alongside the large electron Fermi surface) at the
transition, with the ghost fermions carrying neither spin nor charge, but
minimally coupled to $(U(1) \times U(1))/Z_2$ or $(SU(2) \times U(1))/Z_2$
gauge fields. The $(U(1) \times U(1))/Z_2$ case describes simultaneous Kondo
breakdown and onset of magnetic order: the two gauge fields induce nearly equal
attractive and repulsive interactions between ghost Fermi surface excitations,
and this competition controls the quantum criticality. Away from the transition
on the pseudogap side, the ghost Fermi surface absorbs part of the large
electron Fermi surface, and leads to a jump in the Hall co-efficient. We also
find an example of an ""unnecessary quantum critical point"" between a metal with
spin density wave order, and a metal with local moment magnetic order. The
ghost fermions contribute an enhanced specific heat near the transition, and
could also be detected in other thermal probes. We relate our results to the

the form of the total potential in a theory including quantum gravity.
According to this conjecture potentials possessing metastable de Sitter vacua
are in the swampland of effective field theories that cannot descend from a
theory with gravity. It is known that in the Standard Model (SM), as the quark
masses and theta-parameter are varied, IR- calculable metastable states in QCD
appear (for N > 2 light quarks) and we discuss in detail their properties. We
argue that the SdSC excludes the values of quark masses and theta for which
these metastable states can arise, leading to a possible surprising connection
between quantum gravity and aspects of low-energy flavor phenomenology. The
observed values of the quark masses and QCD theta-parameter are consistent with
the SdSC, giving mild indirect support for the conjecture. If, in addition, as
partially indicated by large-N c and semi-classical analysis, pure SU (3)
Yang-Mills theory has metastable states at theta = 0 (this to our knowledge is
not known) then much of the a-priori SM parameter space is eliminated. In
particular the limit of large electroweak vacuum expectation v_EW > 50 TeV is
excluded by the SdSC if quark Yukawa couplings are kept fixed, possibly
shedding a new light on the hierarchy problem. We argue that these statements
are robust against the addition of a quintessence field unless extreme
fine-tuning is allowed.

synchrotron radiation, while at $10^{-5}\dot{M}_{\text{Edd}}$ the three

dominates the SED near $512\text{ keV}$. In the M87$^\ast$ models,
bremsstrahlung dominates this part of the SED if $a_{\ast} = 0.5$, but inverse

amplification factor of $\sim5.8$ and reveals that the de-lensed continuum
image has the S\'ersic index $\simeq 0.95$ and the S\'ersic radius of
$\sim0.18"" (\sim 1.24$ kpc). Furthermore, the reconstructed [N II] velocity
field in the source plane is dominated by a rotation component with a maximum
velocity of $\sim 300$ km/s at large radii, indicating a dark matter halo mass
of $\sim 10^{12}M_{\odot}$. This, together with the reconstructed velocity
dispersion field being smooth and modest in value ($<100$ km/s) over much of
the outer parts of the galaxy, favours the interpretation of ID 141 being a
disk galaxy dynamically supported by rotation. The observed [N II]/CO (7-6) and
[N II]/[C II] 158 $\mu$m line luminosity ratios, which are consistent with the
corresponding line ratio vs. far-infrared color correlation from local luminous
infrared galaxies, imply a de-lensed star formation rate of ($1.8\pm
0.6)\times10^3M_\odot$/yr and provide an independent estimate on the size of
the star-forming region $0.7^{+0.3}_{-0.3}$ kpc in radius.

either result in an additional thermal contribution to the DM relic density or
suppress otherwise too large abundances compared to the observed levels. In
this work, we assume that the WIMPs only interact with the standard model via
the light scalar portal. We use simple models of fermionic or scalar DM,

predict that their masses should be between $\sim 100~\textrm{GeV}$ and several
$\textrm{TeV}$ to comply both with the DM abundance and current bounds on the

metallicity (<0.03 dex) and age (<0.5 Gyr) is in fact much weaker. We show that
the strong environmental effects found when galaxies are not differentiated
result from a combination of selection effects brought about by the
environmental dependence of the quenched fraction of galaxies, and thus we
strongly advocate for the separation of star-forming, green valley and passive
galaxies when the environmental dependence of galaxy properties are
investigated. We also study further environmental trends separately for both
central and satellite galaxies. We find that star-forming galaxies show no
environmental effects, neither for centrals nor for satellites. In contrast,
the stellar metallicities of passive and green valley satellites increase
weakly (< 0.05 dex and < 0.08 dex, respectively) with increasing halo mass,
increasing local overdensity and decreasing projected distance from their
central; this effect is interpreted in terms of moderate environmental
starvation (`strangulation') contributing to the quenching of satellite
galaxies. Finally, we find a unique feature in the stellar mass--stellar
metallicity relation for passive centrals, where galaxies in more massive
haloes have larger stellar mass (~0.1 dex) at constant stellar metallicity;
this effect is interpreted in terms of dry merging of passive central galaxies

point (about 5.2 K in real He-4) decreases. We discuss various scenarios that
may occur when the two temperatures approach each other and the order
parameters of the superfluid and the liquid-gas phase transitions interact with
each other. The simplest scenario, in which both order parameters become
critical at particular values of the nuclear mass, temperature, and pressure,
can be ruled out through on an analysis of the Landau theory. We argue that in
the most likely scenario, as the nuclear mass decreases, first, a tricritical
point appears on the line separating the superfluid and the normal fluid phase,
then the critical point disappears under the first-order part of superfluid
phase transition line, and in the end the tricritical point disappears. The
last change in the phase diagram occurs when the two-body scattering length
crosses zero, which corresponds to the nuclear mass of about 1.55 u. We develop
a quantitative theory that allows one to determine the phase diagram in the

selection and modeling of the population distribution of 1366 BATSE LGRBs in
the 5-dimensional space of redshift and the four intrinsic prompt gamma-ray
emission properties: the isotropic 1024ms peak luminosity, the total isotropic
emission, the spectral peak energy, as well as the intrinsic duration, while
carefully taking into account the effects of sample incompleteness and the
LGRB-detection mechanism of BATSE. Two fundamental plausible assumptions
underlie our purely-probabilistic approach: 1. LGRBs trace, either exactly or
closely, the Cosmic Star Formation Rate and 2. the joint 4-dimensional
distribution of the aforementioned prompt gamma-ray emission properties is
well-described by a multivariate log-normal distribution.
  Our modeling approach enables us to constrain the redshifts of individual
BATSE LGRBs to within $0.36$ and $0.96$ average uncertainty ranges at $50\%$
and $90\%$ confidence levels, respectively. Our redshift predictions are
completely at odds with the previous redshift estimates of BATSE LGRBs that
were computed via the proposed phenomenological high-energy relations,
specifically, the apparently-strong correlation of LGRBs' peak luminosity with
the spectral peak energy, lightcurve variability, and the spectral lag. The
observed discrepancies between our predictions and the previous works can be
explained by the strong influence of detector threshold and
sample-incompleteness in shaping these phenomenologically-proposed high-energy

to those in the solar neighborhood ($\tau=4$ Gyrs), with a larger dispersion in
[Fe/H] ($\approx0.38$ compared to 0.23 dex). This age gradient comes primarily
from the low-$\alpha$ stars. Looking along the Galactic plane, the very central

($\sigma_{vr}\approx90$ km/s), and simultaneously the smallest dispersion in
age. Moving out in longitude, the stars become kinematically colder and less
dispersed in [Fe/H], but show a much broader range of ages. We see a signature
of the X-shape within the bulge at a latitude of $b=8^\circ$, but not at
$b=12^\circ$. Future APOGEE and other survey data, with larger sampling,
affords the opportunity to extend our approach and study in more detail, to

boson decays into the bottom quark-antiquark pair, and have also established
that the Higgs coupling with the top quark-antiquark pair is instrumental in
one of the modes for Higgs production. This underlines the discovery of the
Yukawa force at the LHC. We demonstrate the impact of this discovery on the
Higgs properties that are related to the dynamics of electroweak symmetry

accelerometers placed on wrist and ankle, and measurements of energy counts by
means of indirect calorimetry. After optimization, we propose an architecture

accelerometer and participant-level data. In this paper, we describe our
efforts to go beyond the standard facilities of a GRU-based RNN, with the aim
of achieving accuracy surpassing the state of the art. These efforts include
switching aggregation function from mean to dispersion measures (SD, IQR, ...),
combining temporal and static data (person-specific details such as age,

matter is unified into a fundamental notion of partition. More precisely, we
find a common origin of Schwarzschild metric on one hand and black-hole entropy
on the other hand. It immediately implies that information and metric are one

gravitational radiation carries black-hole entropy worth of information. There
are three novel experimental predictions. First, we can retrieve information
from the gravitational radiation emitted during merger. Second, if radiation
with right information is sent in, black hole absorbs information and decays
instead of increasing in mass. This is reverse process of black hole formation.
Third, till now only known way of observing nature is through radiation and
fields measured far from the source. There is a completely new way of seeing
nature if we can capture the whole partition of the source in one go.

machines, which - once experimentally realized - would fill this gap. Even
though the concept of the QFM presented here is very general and can be
implemented in any many body quantum system that can be described by a quantum
field theory. We provide here a detailed proposal how to realize a quantum
machine in one-dimensional ultra-cold atomic gases, which consists of a set of
modular operations giving rise to a piston. These can then be coupled
sequentially to thermal baths, with the innovation that a quantum field takes
up the role of the working fluid. In particular, we propose models for
compression on the system to use it as a piston, and coupling to a bath that
gives rise to a valve controlling heat flow. These models are derived within
Bogoliubov theory, which allows us to study the operational primitives
numerically in an efficient way. By composing the numerically modelled
operational primitives we design complete quantum thermodynamic cycles that are
shown to enable cooling and hence giving rise to a quantum field refrigerator.
The active cooling achieved in this way can operate in regimes where existing
cooling methods become ineffective. We describe the consequences of operating
the machine at the quantum level and give an outlook of how this work serves as
a road map to explore open questions in quantum information, quantum
thermodynamic and the study of non-Markovian quantum dynamics.

topologically protected states and as non-Hermitian skin states. In this work,
we show that many-body effects can also induce analogs of these robust states
in place of actual physical boundaries. Particle statistics or suitably
engineered interactions i.e. in ultracold atomic lattices can restrict the
accessible many-body Hilbert space, and introduce effective boundaries in a
spatially periodic higher-dimensional configuration space. We demonstrate the
emergence of topological chiral modes in a two-fermion hopping model without
open boundaries, with fermion pairs confined and asymmetrically propagated by
suitably chosen fluxes. Heterogeneous non-reciprocal hoppings across different
particle species can also result in robust particle clumping in a translation
invariant setting, reminiscent of skin mode accumulation at an open boundary.
But unlike fixed open boundaries, effective boundaries correspond to the
locations of impenetrable particles and are dynamic, giving rise to
fundamentally different many-body vs. single-body time evolution behavior.
Since non-reciprocal accumulation is agnostic to the dimensionality of

conservative dynamics of binary systems in gravity via Post-Minkowskian (PM)
scattering data. Our framework combines a systematic EFT approach to compute
the deflection angle in the PM expansion, together with the 'Boundary-to-Bound'
(B2B) dictionary introduced in [1910.03008, 1911.09130]. Due to the nature of
scattering processes, a remarkable reduction of complexity occurs both in the
number of Feynman diagrams and type of integrals, compared to a direct EFT
computation of the potential in a PM scheme. We provide two illustrative
examples. Firstly, we compute all the conservative gravitational observables
for bound orbits to 2PM, which follow from only one topology beyond leading
order. The results agree with those in [1910.03008, 1911.09130], obtained
through the 'impetus formula' applied to the classical limit of the one loop
amplitude in Cheung et al. [1808.02489]. For the sake of comparison we
reconstruct the conservative Hamiltonian to 2PM order, which is equivalent to
the one derived in [1808.02489] from a matching calculation. Secondly, we
compute the scattering angle due to tidal effects from the electric- and
magnetic-type Love numbers at leading PM order. Using the B2B dictionary we
then obtain the tidal contribution to the periastron advance. We also construct
a Hamiltonian including tidal effects at leading PM order. Although relying on
(relativistic) Feynman diagrams, the EFT formalism developed here does not
involve taking the classical limit of a quantum amplitude, neither integrals
with internal massive fields, nor additional matching calculations, nor
spurious ('super-classical') infrared singularities. By construction, the EFT
approach can be automatized to all PM orders.

in the outer part of the disc ($R> 1$ AU). They also potentially lead to
self-organisation of the disc into large-scale axisymmetric structures, similar
to the rings recently imaged by sub-millimetre or near-infrared instruments
(ALMA and SPHERE). The aim of this paper is to investigate the mechanism behind
the formation of these gaseous rings, but also to understand the dust dynamics
and its emission in discs threaded by a large-scale magnetic field. To this
end, we performed global magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) axisymmetric simulations
with ambipolar diffusion using a modified version of the PLUTO code. We
explored different magnetisations with the midplane $\beta$ parameter ranging
from $10^5$ to $10^3$ and included dust grains -- treated in the fluid
approximation -- ranging from $100 \mu$m to 1 cm in size. We first show that
the gaseous rings (associated with zonal flows) are tightly linked to the
existence of MHD winds. Secondly, we find that millimetre-size dust is highly
sedimented, with a typical scale height of 1 AU at $R=100$ AU for $\beta=10^4$,
compatible with recent ALMA observations. We also show that these grains
concentrate into pressure maxima associated with zonal flows, leading to the
formation of dusty rings. Using the radiative transfer code MCFOST, we computed
the dust emission and make predictions on the ring-gap contrast and the

Towards addressing this, we summarise our recent work investigating: (1) the
physical drivers of ionised outflows and (2) observational signatures of the
impact by jets/outflows on star formation and molecular gas content in AGN host
galaxies. We confirm a connection between radio emission and extreme ionised
gas kinematics in AGN hosts. Emission-line selected AGN are significantly more
likely to exhibit ionised outflows (as traced by the [O III] emission line) if
the projected linear extent of the radio emission is confined within the
spectroscopic aperture. Follow-up high resolution radio observations and
integral field spectroscopy of 10 luminous Type 2 AGN reveal moderate power,
young (or frustrated) jets interacting with the interstellar medium. We find
that these sources live in highly star forming and gas rich galaxies.
Additionally, by combining ALMA-derived dust maps with integral field
spectroscopy for eight host galaxies of z~2 X-ray AGN, we show that H-alpha
emission is an unreliable tracer of star formation. For the five targets with
ionised outflows we find no dramatic in-situ shut down of the star formation.
Across both of these studies we find that if these AGN do have a negative
impact upon their host galaxies, it must be happening on small (unresolved)
spatial scales and/or an observable galaxy-wide impact has yet to occur.

analysis. As the generation of word embeddings needs huge corpora, many
applications use pretrained embeddings. In spite of the success, word
embeddings suffers from certain drawbacks such as it does not capture sentiment
information of a word, contextual information in terms of parts of speech tags
and domain-specific information. In this work we propose HIDE a Hybrid Improved
Document level Embedding which incorporates domain information, parts of speech
information and sentiment information into existing word embeddings such as
GloVe and Word2Vec. It combine improved word embeddings into document level
embeddings. Further, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) has been used to represent
documents as a vectors. HIDE is generated, combining LSA and document level
embeddings, which is computed from improved word embeddings. We test HIDE with
six different datasets and shown considerable improvement over the accuracy of
existing pretrained word vectors such as GloVe and Word2Vec. We further compare
our work with two existing document level sentiment analysis approaches. HIDE
performs better than existing systems.

  Volatility Clustering and Nonlinear Dependence",,,,,"econ.EM math.ST stat.TH","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Many financial and economic variables, including financial returns, exhibit
nonlinear dependence, heterogeneity and heavy-tailedness. These properties may
make problematic the analysis of (non-)efficiency and volatility clustering in
economic and financial markets using traditional approaches that appeal to
asymptotic normality of sample autocorrelation functions of returns and their
squares.
  This paper presents new approaches to deal with the above problems. We
provide the results that motivate the use of measures of market
(non-)efficiency and volatility clustering based on (small) powers of absolute
returns and their signed versions.
  We further provide new approaches to robust inference on the measures in the
case of general time series, including GARCH-type processes. The approaches are
based on robust $t-$statistics tests and new results on their applicability are
presented. In the approaches, parameter estimates (e.g., estimates of measures
of nonlinear dependence) are computed for groups of data, and the inference is
based on $t-$statistics in the resulting group estimates. This results in valid
robust inference under heterogeneity and dependence assumptions satisfied in
real-world financial markets. Numerical results and empirical applications
confirm the advantages and wide applicability of the proposed approaches.

ways to decompose matrix flows and single matrices globally via one constant
matrix similarity $C_{n,n}$ as $A(t) = C ^{-1} \cdot \text{ diag}(A_1(t), ...,

uses the concept of invariant subspaces for the Matlab {\tt eig} computed
'eigenvectors' of one associated flow matrix $B(t_a)$ to find the coarsest
simultaneous block structure for all flow matrices $B(t_b)$. The method works
very efficiently for all time-varying matrix flows, be they differentiable,
continuous or discontinuous in $t$, and for all fixed entry matrices $A$; as
well as for all types of square matrix flows or fixed entry matrices such as
hermitean, real symmetric, normal or general complex and real flows $A(t)$ or

decomposable flows as they originate in sensor driven outputs for time-varying
matrix problems and thereby help to reduce the complexities of their numerical
treatments through adapting 'divide and conquer' methods for their diagonal
sub-blocks. Our method is also applicable to standard fixed entry matrices of

virtual density distribution along the a diffusely reflective surface is
introduced to aid the investigations. Many local surface properties are
obtained, including surface slip velocity, coefficients for pressure, friction,

people globally with a relatively high mortality rate. There are many
therapeutics undergoing clinical trials, but there is no effective vaccine or

Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), molecular signaling of host cells plays
critical roles during the life cycle of SARS-CoV-2. Thus, it is significant to
identify the involved molecular signaling pathways within the host cells, and
drugs targeting these molecular signaling pathways could be potentially
effective for COVID-19 treatment. In this study, we aimed to identify these
potential molecular signaling pathways, and repurpose existing drugs as a
potentially effective treatment of COVID-19 to facilitate the therapeutic
discovery, based on the transcriptional response of host cells. We first
identified dysfunctional signaling pathways associated with the infection
caused SARS-CoV-2 in human lung epithelial cells through analysis of the
altered gene expression profiles. In addition to the signaling pathway
analysis, the activated gene ontologies (GOs) and super gene ontologies were
identified. Signaling pathways and GOs such as MAPK, JNK, STAT, ERK, JAK-STAT,
IRF7-NFkB signaling, and MYD88/CXCR6 immune signaling were particularly
identified. Based on the identified signaling pathways and GOs, a set of
potentially effective drugs were repurposed by integrating the drug-target and
reverse gene expression data resources. The dexamethasone was top-ranked in the
prediction, which was the first reported drug to be able to significantly
reduce the death rate of COVID-19 patients receiving respiratory support. The
results can be helpful to understand the associated molecular signaling
pathways within host cells, and facilitate the discovery of effective drugs for

systems. Metastability is a consequence of a large separation in timescales in
the dynamics, leading to the existence of a regime when states of the system
appear stationary, before eventual relaxation toward a true stationary state at
much larger times. In this work, we focus on the emergence of classical
metastability, i.e., when metastable states of an open quantum system with
separation of timescales can be approximated as probabilistic mixtures of a
finite number of states. We find that a number of classical features follow
from this approximation, for the manifold of metastable states, long-time
dynamics between them, and symmetries of the dynamics. Namely, those states are
approximately disjoint and thus play the role of metastable phases, the
relaxation toward the stationary state is approximated by a classical
stochastic dynamics between them, and weak symmetries correspond to their
permutations. Importantly, the classical dynamics is observed not only on
average, but also at the level of individual quantum trajectories: We show that
time coarse-grained continuous measurement records can be viewed as noisy
classical trajectories, while their statistics can be approximated by that of
the classical dynamics. Among others, this explains how first-order dynamical
phase transitions arise from metastability. Finally, to verify the presence of
classical metastability in a given open quantum system, we develop an efficient
numerical approach that delivers the set of metastable phases together with the
effective classical dynamics. Since the proximity to a first-order dissipative
phase transition manifests as metastability, the theory and tools introduced in
this work can be used to investigate such transitions through the metastable
behavior of many-body systems of moderate sizes accessible to numerics.

often the bottleneck in the development of machine learning (ML) applications
in any domain. For agricultural applications, ML-based models designed to
perform tasks such as autonomous plant classification will typically be coupled
to just one or perhaps a few plant species. As a consequence, each
crop-specific task is very likely to require its own specialized training data,
and the question of how to serve this need for data now often overshadows the
more routine exercise of actually training such models. To tackle this problem,
we have developed an embedded robotic system to automatically generate and
label large datasets of plant images for ML applications in agriculture. The
system can image plants from virtually any angle, thereby ensuring a wide
variety of data; and with an imaging rate of up to one image per second, it can
produce lableled datasets on the scale of thousands to tens of thousands of
images per day. As such, this system offers an important alternative to time-
and cost-intensive methods of manual generation and labeling. Furthermore, the
use of a uniform background made of blue keying fabric enables additional image
processing techniques such as background replacement and plant segmentation. It
also helps in the training process, essentially forcing the model to focus on
the plant features and eliminating random correlations. To demonstrate the
capabilities of our system, we generated a dataset of over 34,000 labeled
images, with which we trained an ML-model to distinguish grasses from
non-grasses in test data from a variety of sources. We now plan to generate
much larger datasets of Canadian crop plants and weeds that will be made
publicly available in the hope of further enabling ML applications in the
agriculture sector.

synthesizer for microdata dissemination with a new re-weighting strategy that
maximizes utility of released synthetic data under at any level of formal
privacy guarantee. Our re-weighting strategy applies to any vector-weighted
pseudo posterior mechanism under which a vector of observation-indexed weights
are used to downweight likelihood contributions for high disclosure risk
records. We demonstrate our method on two different vector-weighted schemes
that target high-risk records. Our new method for constructing record-indexed
downeighting maximizes the data utility under any privacy budget for the
vector-weighted synthesizers by adjusting the by-record weights, such that
their individual Lipschitz bounds approach the bound for the entire database.
Our method achieves an $(\epsilon = 2 \Delta_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}})-$asymptotic
differential privacy (aDP) guarantee, globally, over the space of databases. We
illustrate our methods using simulated highly skewed count data and compare the
results to a scalar-weighted synthesizer under the Exponential Mechanism (EM).
We also apply our methods to a sample of the Survey of Doctorate Recipients and
demonstrate the practicality of our methods.

become an important electron transfer protein in humans. In its ferrous form,
it undergoes ligand release and doming upon photoexcitation, but its ferric

fundamental to the design of reliable mmWave networks, with accuracy rooted in

Quasi-Deterministic (QD) models are highly accurate channel models, which
characterize the propagation in terms of clusters of multipath components,

obtained with an open source NIST QD model implementation against real

  Using the ZNN Based Path Following Method","18 pages, 14 figures, 2 tables",,,,"math.NA cs.NA","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","  This paper describes and develops a fast and accurate path following
algorithm that computes the field of values boundary curve for every
conceivable complex or real square matrix $A$. It relies on a matrix flow
decomposition method that finds a proper block-diagonal flow representation for
the associated hermitean matrix flow ${\cal F}_A(t) = \cos(t) H + \sin(t) K$.
Here ${\cal F}_A(t)$ is a 1-parameter-varying linear combination of the real
and skew part matrices $H = (A+A^*)/2$ and $K = (A-A^*)/(2i)$ of $A$. For
decomposing flows ${\cal F}_A(t)$, the algorithm decomposes a given dense
general matrix $A$ unitarily into block-diagonal form $U^*AU = \text { diag}
(A_j)$ with $j > 1$ diagonal blocks $A_j$ whose individual sizes add up to the
size of $A$. It then computes the field of values boundaries separately for
each diagonal block $A_j$ using the path following ZNN eigenvalue method. The
convex hull of all sub-fields of values boundary points then determines the
field of values boundary curve correctly for decomposing and non-decomposing
matrices $A$. The algorithm removes standard restrictions for path following
FoV methods that generally cannot deal with decomposing matrices $A$ due to
possible eigencurve crossings of ${\cal F}_A(t)$. Tests and numerical
comparisons are included. Our ZNN based method is coded for sequential and
parallel computations and both versions run very accurately and very fast when
compared with Johnson's Francis QR eigenvalue and Bendixon rectangle based
method that computes complete eigenanalyses of ${\cal F}_A(t_k)$ for every

with the comet outbound at 2.8 AU (Drahus et al.~2020), was caused by the
expulsion of solid particles having a combined cross-section about 100 sq. km
and a mass in 0.1 mm sized particles about 2e7 kg. The latter corresponds to
1e-4 of the mass of the nucleus, taken as a sphere of radius 500 m. A transient
``double nucleus'' was observed on UT 2020 March 30 (about three weeks after
the outburst), having a cross-section about 0.6 sq. km and corresponding dust
mass 1e5 kg. The secondary was absent in images taken on and before March 28,
and in images taken on and after April 03. The unexpectedly delayed appearance
and rapid disappearance of the secondary are consistent with an origin through
rotational bursting of one or more large (meter-sized) boulders under the
action of outgassing torques, following their ejection from the main nucleus.
Overall, our observations reveal that the outburst and splitting of the nucleus
are minor events involving a negligible fraction of the total mass: 2I/Borisov
will survive its passage through the planetary region largely unscathed.

fluxes of heat or solute species, due to the interactions of out-of-phase
velocity and temperature/concentration fields, respectively. Herein, we
investigate such transport (a form of the well-known Taylor--Aris dispersion)
in the gap between two parallel plates, one of which oscillates vertically,
generating a time-periodic squeeze flow of either a newtonian or Maxwellian
fluid. Using the method of multiple time-scale homogenization, the mass/heat
balance equation describing transport in this flow is reduced to a
one-dimensional advection--diffusion--reaction equation. This result indicates
three effective mechanisms in the mass/heat transfer in the system: an
effective diffusion that spreads mass/heat along the concentration/temperature
gradient, an effective advective flux, and an effective reaction that releases
or absorbs mass/heat - in the time-averaged frame. Our results demonstrate that
there exist resonant modes under which the velocity peaks when the
dimensionless plate oscillation frequency (embodied by the Womersley number,
the ratio of the transient inertia to viscous forces) approaches specific
values. As a result, transport in this flow is significantly influenced by the
dimensionless frequency. On the one hand, the effective, time-averaged
dispersion coefficient is always larger than the molecular diffusivity, and is
sharply enhanced near resonance. The interaction between fluid elasticity and
the oscillatory forcing enhances the efficiency of transport in the system. On
the other hand, the identified effective advection and reaction mechanisms may
transport mass/heat from regions of high concentration/temperature to those of
low concentration/temperature, or vice versa, depending on the value of
dimensionless frequency.

z_beta is closely related to periods of modular forms over the geodesic in the

predict the imaginary part of the amplitude to leading-logarithmic order for

ladder diagrams with any number of rungs formed between two Reggeized gluons.
Our approach exploits a separation of the two-Reggeon wavefunction, performed
directly in momentum space, between a soft region and a generic (hard) region.
The former component of the wavefunction leads to infrared divergences in the
amplitude and is therefore computed in dimensional regularization; the latter
is computed directly in two transverse dimensions and is expressed in terms of
single-valued harmonic polylogarithms of uniform weight. By combining the two
we determine exactly both infrared-divergent and finite contributions to the
two-to-two scattering amplitude order-by-order in perturbation theory. We study
the result numerically to 13 loops and find that finite corrections to the

collection $\mathfrak{B}$ of three-dimensional subspaces of $V$ such that every
two-dimensional subspace of $V$ is contained in exactly one element $B$ of
$\mathfrak{B}$. The question of existence of $q$-Fano planes over any field has
been open since the 1970s and has attracted considerable attention in the
special case that $F$ is finite. Here we show the existence of $2$-$(7, 3,
1)_F$-subspace designs over certain infinite fields $F$, including (among
others) $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{F}_q(x, y, z)$ for $q$ odd.
  The space $V$ is the 7-dimensional space of imaginary elements in a Cayley
division algebra $O$ over $F$ and $\mathfrak{B}$ consists of the intersections
with $V$ of all 4-dimensional subalgebras of $O$. We will present the required
background on Cayley algebras in a self-contained fashion.
  Next we study what happens if we apply the same procedure to split (rather
than division) Cayley algebras. By identifying all four-dimensional subalgebras
of these, we show that in that case our construction still yields an inclusion
minimal $(7, 3, 2)$ $q$-covering design. That is: every two-dimensional
subspace of $V$ is contained in at least one element of the resulting set
$\mathfrak{B}$ of three-dimensional subspaces of $V$ and no proper subset of
$\mathfrak{B}$ has this property. However none of these $q$-covering designs
are $q$-Fano planes. In the case that $F$ is finite we compute the number of
elements of $\mathfrak{B}$.
  We also give a purely combinatorial construction of our $q$-Fano planes and
$q$-covering designs for an abstract 7-dimensional $F$-vector space $V$ by
identifying the collection $\mathfrak{B}$ as a subvariety of the Grassmanian
$Gr_3(V)$ defined entirely in terms of the classical Fano plane.

(NGC 5272). We show new evidence for two M3 populations with distinctly
different carbon and nitrogen abundances, seen in a sharp division between
CN-weak and CN-strong red-giant branches (RGBs) in M3. The CN-strong population
shows a C-N anticorrelation that is a natural consequence of the CN cycle,
while the CN-weak population shows no or a weak C-N anticorrelation.
Additionally, the CN-weak population exhibits an elongated spatial distribution
that is likely linked to its fast rotation. Our derived metallicity reveals
bimodal metallicity distributions in both populations, with
$\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle\approx-$1.60 and $-$1.45, which appear to be
responsible for the discrete double RGB bumps in the CN-weak and the large
$W^{1G}_{F275W-F814W}$ range. From this discovery, we propose that M3 consists
of two GCs, namely the C1 (23\%, $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle\approx-1.60$) and C2
(77\%, $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle\approx-1.45$), each of which has its own C-N
anticorrelation and structural and kinematical property, which is a strong
indication of independent systems in M3. The fractions of the CN-weak
population for both the C1 and C2 are high compared to Galactic GCs but they
are in good agreement with GCs in Magellanic Clouds. It is believed that M3 is
a merger remnant of the two GCs, most likely in a dwarf galaxy environment, and
accreted to our Galaxy later in time. This is consistent with recent proposals
of an ex-situ origin of M3.

field-induced phase transition from a trivial to a topological superconductor,
marked by the closure and re-opening of the excitation gap, followed by the
emergence of Majorana bound states at the nanowire ends. Many local
density-of-states measurements have reported signatures of the topological
phase, however this interpretation has been challenged by alternative
explanations. Here, by measuring nonlocal conductance, we identify the closure
of the excitation gap in the bulk of the semiconductor before the emergence of
zero-bias peaks. This observation is inconsistent with scenarios where
zero-bias peaks occur due to end-states with a trivially gapped bulk, which
have been extensively considered in the theoretical and experimental
literature. We observe that after the gap closes, nonlocal signals fluctuate
strongly and persist irrespective of the presence of local-conductance
zero-bias peaks. Thus, our observations are also incompatible with a simple
picture of clean topological superconductivity. This work presents a new
experimental approach for probing the spatial extent of states in Majorana
wires, and reveals the presence of a regime with a continuum of spatially
extended states and uncorrelated zero-bias peaks.

Many of them have the structure of dual funnel problem: as the sample size
decreases from one stage to the other, the information increases. A related
example is a selection process, where applicants apply for a position, prize,
or grant. In each stage, more applicants are evaluated and filtered out, and
from the remaining ones, more information is collected. In the last stage,
decision-makers use all available information to make their final decision. To
train a classifier for each stage becomes impracticable as they can underfit
due to the low dimensionality in early stages or overfit due to the small
sample size in the latter stages. In this work, we proposed a
\textit{Multi-StaGe Transfer Learning} (MSGTL) approach that uses knowledge
from simple classifiers trained in early stages to improve the performance of
classifiers in the latter stages. By transferring weights from simpler neural
networks trained in larger datasets, we able to fine-tune more complex neural
networks in the latter stages without overfitting due to the small sample size.
We show that it is possible to control the trade-off between conserving
knowledge and fine-tuning using a simple probabilistic map. Experiments using
real-world data demonstrate the efficacy of our approach as it outperforms
other state-of-the-art methods for transfer learning and regularization.

techniques involving path propagation mainly focus on the inference on nodes
labels and neighborhood structures. However, entity links in the real world
also contain rich hierarchical inheritance relations. For example, the
vulnerability of a product version is likely to be inherited from its older
versions. Taking advantage of the hierarchical inheritances can potentially
improve the quality of query results. Motivated by this, we explore
hierarchical inheritance relations between entities and formulate the problem
of graph query on HINs with hierarchical inheritance relations. We propose a
graph query search algorithm by decomposing the original query graph into
multiple star queries and apply a star query algorithm to each star query.
Further candidates from each star query result are then constructed for final
top-k query answers to the original query. To efficiently obtain the graph
query result from a large-scale HIN, we design a bound-based pruning technique
by using uniform cost search to prune search spaces. We implement our algorithm
in GraphX to test the effectiveness and efficiency on synthetic and real-world
datasets. Compared with two common graph query algorithms, our algorithm can
effectively obtain more accurate results and competitive performances.

Thus, it is essential to predict unknown QoS values. Although various QoS
prediction methods have been proposed, few of them have taken outliers into
consideration, which may dramatically degrade the prediction performance. To
overcome this limitation, we propose an outlier-resilient QoS prediction method
in this paper. Our method utilizes Cauchy loss to measure the discrepancy
between the observed QoS values and the predicted ones. Owing to the robustness
of Cauchy loss, our method is resilient to outliers. We further extend our
method to provide time-aware QoS prediction results by taking the temporal

  Integer Submodular Models",,,,,"cs.LG stat.ML","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Submodular functions have been studied extensively in machine learning and
data mining. In particular, the optimization of submodular functions over the
integer lattice (integer submodular functions) has recently attracted much
interest, because this domain relates naturally to many practical problem
settings, such as multilabel graph cut, budget allocation and revenue
maximization with discrete assignments. In contrast, the use of these functions
for probabilistic modeling has received surprisingly little attention so far.
In this work, we firstly propose the Generalized Multilinear Extension, a
continuous DR-submodular extension for integer submodular functions. We study
central properties of this extension and formulate a new probabilistic model
which is defined through integer submodular functions. Then, we introduce a
block-coordinate ascent algorithm to perform approximate inference for those
class of models. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness and viability on
several real-world social connection graph datasets with integer submodular
objectives.

performance monitoring and improvement, generally involves large amounts of
data from different sources. To effectively integrate and manage these sources,
automatically finding semantic matches among their schemas or ontologies is
crucial. Existing approaches on database matching mainly fall into two
categories. One focuses on the schema-level matching based on schema properties
such as field names, data types, constraints and schema structures. Network
management databases contain massive tables (e.g., network products, incidents,
security alert and logs) from different departments and groups with nonuniform
field names and schema characteristics. It is not reliable to match them by
those schema properties. The other category is based on the instance-level
matching using general string similarity techniques, which are not applicable
for the matching of large network management databases. In this paper, we
develop a matching technique for large NEtwork MAnagement databases (NEMA)
deploying instance-level matching for effective data integration and
connection. We design matching metrics and scores for both numerical and
non-numerical fields and propose algorithms for matching these fields. The
effectiveness and efficiency of NEMA are evaluated by conducting experiments
based on ground truth field pairs in large network management databases. Our
measurement on large databases with 1,458 fields, each of which contains over
10 million records, reveals that the accuracies of NEMA are up to 95%. It
achieves 2%-10% higher accuracy and 5x-14x speedup over baseline methods.

carried out with the RAMSES code. To compare with observations, we post-process
a snapshot of a bridge-like structure that is associated with a forming triple
star system with the radiative transfer code POLARIS and produce
multi-wavelength dust polarization maps. In the most prominent bridge of our
sample, the typical density is about 10^(-16) g cm^(-3), and the magnetic field
strength is about 1 to 2 mG. The magnetic field structure has an elongated
toroidal morphology and the dust polarization maps trace the complex
morphology. In contrast, the magnetic field strength associated with the
launching of asymmetric bipolar outflows is significantly more magnetized (~100
mG). At {\lambda}=1.3 mm, the orientation of grains in the bridge is similar
for the case accounting for radiative alignment torques (RATs) compared to
perfect alignment with magnetic field lines. However, the polarization fraction
in the bridge is three times smaller for the RAT scenario compared to assuming
perfect alignment. At shorter wavelengths ({\lambda} < 200 {\mu}m), dust
polarization does not trace the magnetic field because other effects such as
self-scattering and dichroic extinction dominate the orientation of the
polarization.

compression, in this work we present a multifaceted study of the phase behavior
of zircon-type orthovanadate PrVO$_4$ under high pressure conditions, up until
24 GPa. We have found that PrVO$_4$ undergoes a zircon to monazite transition
at around 6 GPa, confirming previous results found by Raman experiments. A
second transition takes place above 14 GPa, to a BaWO$_4$-I--type structure.
The zircon to monazite structural sequence is an irreversible first-order
transition, accompanied by a volume collapse of about 9.6%. Monazite phase is
thus a metastable polymorph of PrVO$_4$. The monazite-BaWO$_4$-II transition is
found to be reversible instead and occurs with a similar volume change. Here we
report and discuss the axial and bulk compressibility of all phases. We also
compare our results with those for other rare-earth orthovanadates. Finally, by
means of optical-absorption experiments and resistivity measurements we
determined the effect of pressure on the electronic properties of PrVO$_4$. We
found that the zircon-monazite transition produces a collapse of the band gap
and an abrupt decrease of the resistivity. The physical reasons for this
behavior are discussed. Density-functional-theory simulations support our
conclusions.

or multiple noisy graph signals. The proposed graph unrolling networks expand
algorithm unrolling to the graph domain and provide an interpretation of the
architecture design from a signal processing perspective. We unroll an
iterative denoising algorithm by mapping each iteration into a single network
layer where the feed-forward process is equivalent to iteratively denoising
graph signals. We train the graph unrolling networks through unsupervised
learning, where the input noisy graph signals are used to supervise the
networks. By leveraging the learning ability of neural networks, we adaptively
capture appropriate priors from input noisy graph signals, instead of manually
choosing signal priors. A core component of graph unrolling networks is the
edge-weight-sharing graph convolution operation, which parameterizes each edge
weight by a trainable kernel function where the trainable parameters are shared
by all the edges. The proposed convolution is permutation-equivariant and can
flexibly adjust the edge weights to various graph signals. We then consider two
special cases of this class of networks, graph unrolling sparse coding (GUSC)
and graph unrolling trend filtering (GUTF), by unrolling sparse coding and
trend filtering, respectively. To validate the proposed methods, we conduct
extensive experiments on both real-world datasets and simulated datasets, and
demonstrate that our methods have smaller denoising errors than conventional
denoising algorithms and state-of-the-art graph neural networks. For denoising
a single smooth graph signal, the normalized mean square error of the proposed
networks is around 40% and 60% lower than that of graph Laplacian denoising and
graph wavelets, respectively.

approximately constant when conditioned on weak enstrophy; whereas they grow
approximately as power laws for strong enstrophy, which become steeper with
increasing $R_\lambda$. We find that the well-known preferential alignment
between vorticity and the intermediate eigenvector of strain tensor is even
stronger for large enstrophy, whereas vorticity shows a tendency to be weakly
orthogonal to the most extensive eigenvector (for large enstrophy). Yet the
dominant contribution to the production of large enstrophy events arises from
the most extensive eigendirection, the more so as $R_\lambda$ increases.
Nevertheless, the stretching in intense vorticity regions is significantly
depleted, consistent with the kinematic properties of weakly-curved tubes in
which they are organized. Further analysis reveals that intense enstrophy is
primarily depleted via viscous diffusion, though viscous dissipation is also
significant. Implications for modeling are nominally addressed as appropriate.

edge devices, close to the video source. However, the current video analysis
pipeline has several disadvantages when dealing with such advances. For
example, video encoders have been designed for a long time to please human
viewers and be agnostic of the downstream analysis task (e.g., object

important problem. Certain groups, such as the policy makers, rely on it to
make wise decisions. Back in the old days when labor-intensive survey-studies
were needed to collect public opinions, analyzing ordinary citizens' political
tendencies was uneasy. The rise of social medias, such as Twitter, has enabled
us to gather ordinary citizen's data easily. However, the incompleteness of the
labels and the features in social network datasets is tricky, not to mention
the enormous data size and the heterogeneousity. The data differ dramatically
from many commonly-used datasets, thus brings unique challenges. In our work,
first we built our own datasets from Twitter. Next, we proposed TIMME, a
multi-task multi-relational embedding model, that works efficiently on
sparsely-labeled heterogeneous real-world dataset. It could also handle the
incompleteness of the input features. Experimental results showed that TIMME is
overall better than the state-of-the-art models for ideology detection on
Twitter. Our findings include: links can lead to good classification outcomes
without text; conservative voice is under-represented on Twitter; follow is the
most important relation to predict ideology; retweet and mention enhance a
higher chance of like, etc. Last but not least, TIMME could be extended to
other datasets and tasks in theory.

this problem was to implement a CART decision tree algorithm that helps to
predict the probability that a student has of scoring higher than the mean
value, based on different socioeconomic and academic factors, such as the
profession of the parents of the subject parents and the results obtained on

score in the Saber 11, on the topic of Social Studies, and that the gender of
the subject is not as influential as it is usually portrayed as. The algorithm
designed provided significant insight into which factors most affect the

signals, pilot-aided S-CSI is inaccurate since interference statistics on pilot
and non-pilot resources can be different. Moreover, the channel will be bimodal
as a result of the periodic interference. In this paper, we propose a max-min
heuristic to estimate the post-equalizer SINR in the case of non-pilot pulsed
radar interference, and characterize its distribution as a function of noise
variance and interference power. We observe that the proposed heuristic incurs
low computational complexity, and is robust beyond a certain SINR threshold for
different modulation schemes, especially for QPSK. This enables us to develop a
comprehensive semi-blind framework to estimate the wideband SINR metric that is
commonly used for S-CSI quantization in 3GPP Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and New
Radio (NR) networks. Finally, we propose dual CSI feedback for practical
radar-cellular spectrum sharing, to enable accurate CSI acquisition in the
bimodal channel. We demonstrate significant improvements in throughput, block

detect earthquakes and estimate their source parameters from continuous seismic
waveform streams. The system determines earthquake location and magnitude as
soon as one station receives earthquake signals and evolutionarily improves the
solutions by receiving continuous data. We apply the system to the 2016 Mw 6.0
earthquake in Central Apennines, Italy and its subsequent sequence. Earthquake
locations and magnitudes can be reliably determined as early as four seconds
after the earliest P phase, with mean error ranges of 6.8-3.7 km and 0.31-0.23,

changes a combinatorial problem of choosing which subset of the parameter are
zero, into a simple continuous optimization. Using a continuous prior
concentrated near zero, the Bayesian counterparts are successful in quantifying
the uncertainty in the variable selection problems; nevertheless, the lack of
exact zeros makes it difficult for broader problems such as the change-point
detection and rank selection. Inspired by the duality of the l1-regularization
as a constraint onto an l1-ball, we propose a new prior by projecting a
continuous distribution onto the l1-ball. This creates a positive probability
on the ball boundary, which contains both continuous elements and exact zeros.
Unlike the spike-and-slab prior, this l1-ball projection is continuous and
differentiable almost surely, making the posterior estimation amenable to the
Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. We examine the properties, such as the
volume change due to the projection, the connection to the combinatorial prior,
the minimax concentration rate in the linear problem. We demonstrate the
usefulness of exact zeros that simplify the combinatorial problems, such as the
change-point detection in time series, the dimension selection of mixture model
and the low-rank-plus-sparse change detection in the medical images.

and have been extensively analyzed. But little is known about the effect of
fine-tuning on specific tasks. Intuitively, people may agree that a pre-trained
model already learns semantic representations of words (e.g. synonyms are
closer to each other) and fine-tuning further improves its capabilities which
require more complicated reasoning (e.g. coreference resolution, entity
boundary detection, etc). However, how to verify these arguments analytically
and quantitatively is a challenging task and there are few works focus on this
topic. In this paper, inspired by the observation that most probing tasks
involve identifying matched pairs of phrases (e.g. coreference requires
matching an entity and a pronoun), we propose a pairwise probe to understand
BERT fine-tuning on the machine reading comprehension (MRC) task. Specifically,
we identify five phenomena in MRC. According to pairwise probing tasks, we
compare the performance of each layer's hidden representation of pre-trained
and fine-tuned BERT. The proposed pairwise probe alleviates the problem of
distraction from inaccurate model training and makes a robust and quantitative
comparison. Our experimental analysis leads to highly confident conclusions:
(1) Fine-tuning has little effect on the fundamental and low-level information
and general semantic tasks. (2) For specific abilities required for downstream
tasks, fine-tuned BERT is better than pre-trained BERT and such gaps are
obvious after the fifth layer.

ridge regression (KRR) estimator in nonparametric regression with random design
that is broadly applicable for multi-dimensional support and arbitrary
mixed-partial derivatives. We provide a non-asymptotic analysis to study the
behavior of the proposed estimator in a unified manner that encompasses the
regression function and its derivatives, leading to two error bounds for a
general class of kernels under the strong $L_\infty$ norm. In a concrete
example specialized to kernels with polynomially decaying eigenvalues, the
proposed estimator recovers the minimax optimal rate up to a logarithmic factor
for estimating derivatives of functions in H\""older and Sobolev classes.
Interestingly, the proposed estimator achieves the optimal rate of convergence
with the same choice of tuning parameter for any order of derivatives. Hence,
the proposed estimator enjoys a \textit{plug-in property} for derivatives in
that it automatically adapts to the order of derivatives to be estimated,
enabling easy tuning in practice. Our simulation studies show favorable finite
sample performance of the proposed method relative to several existing methods
blue and corroborate the theoretical findings on its minimax optimality.

spectroscopic survey. We classify our galaxies into single exponential (TI),
down-bending (TII) and up-bending (TIII) SBP types, and derive their spin
parameters and radial profiles of age/metallicity-sensitive spectral features.
Most TII (TIII) galaxies have down-bending (up-bending) star formation rate
(SFR) radial profiles, implying that abrupt radial changes of SFR intensities
contribute to the formation of both TII and TIII breaks. Nevertheless, a
comparison between our galaxies and simulations suggests that stellar migration
plays a significant role in weakening down-bending $\Sigma_{\star}$ profile
breaks. While there is a correlation between the break strengths of SBPs and
age/metallicity-sensitive spectral features for TII galaxies, no such
correlation is found for TIII galaxies, indicating that stellar migration may
not play a major role in shaping TIII breaks, as is evidenced by a good
correspondence between break strengths of $\Sigma_{\star}$ and surface
brightness profiles of TIII galaxies. We do not find evidence for galaxy spin
being a relevant parameter for forming different SBP types, nor do we find
significant differences between the asymmetries of galaxies with different SBP
types, suggesting that environmental disturbances or satellite accretion in the
recent past do not significantly influence the break formation. By dividing our
sample into early and late morphological types, we find that galaxies with
different SBP types follow nearly the same tight stellar mass-$R_{25}$
relation, which makes the hypothesis that stellar migration alone can transform
SBP types from TII to TI and then to TIII highly unlikely.

preserve the LDP of $\{B_T\}_{T>0}$. These results show the ability of

measurement, a roadside section of the Stanford DAS-2 array can record seismic
signals from various sources. For example, it measures the earth's quasi-static
distortion caused by the weight of cars (<0.8 Hz), and Rayleigh waves induced
by earthquakes (<3 Hz) and by dynamic car-road interactions (3-20 Hz). We
directly utilize the excited surface waves for shallow shear-wave velocity
inversion. Rayleigh waves induced by passing cars have a consistent fundamental
mode and a noisier first mode. By stacking dispersion images of 33 passing
cars, we obtain stable dispersion images. The frequency range of the
fundamental mode can be extended by adding the low-frequency earthquake-induced
Rayleigh waves. Thanks to the extended frequency range, we can achieve better
depth coverage and resolution for shear-wave velocity inversion. In order to
assure clear separation from Love waves and aligning apparent velocity with
phase velocity, we choose an earthquake that is approximately in line with the
array. The inverted models match those obtained by a conventional geophone
survey performed by a geotechnical service company contracted by Stanford
University using active sources from the surface until about 50 meters. In
order to automate the Vs inversion process, we introduce a new objective
function that avoids manual dispersion curve picking. We construct a 2-D Vs
profile by performing independent 1-D inversions at multiple locations along
the fiber. From the low-frequency quasi-static distortion recordings, we invert
for a single Poisson's ratio at each location along the fiber. We observe
spatial heterogeneity of both Vs and Poisson's ratio profiles. Our approach is
dramatically cheaper than ambient field interferometry and reliable estimates
can be obtained more frequently as no lengthy cross-correlations are required.

proved highly effective in person re-identification (re-ID). Researchers design
multi-branch networks using part models, yet they always attribute the
effectiveness to multiple parts. In addition, existing multi-branch networks
always have isomorphic branches, which lack structural diversity. In order to
improve this problem, we propose a novel Heterogeneous Branch and Multi-level
Classification Network (HBMCN), which is designed based on the pre-trained
ResNet-50 model. A new heterogeneous branch, SE-Res-Branch, is proposed based
on the SE-Res module, which consists of the Squeeze-and-Excitation block and
the residual block. Furthermore, a new multi-level classification joint
objective function is proposed for the supervised learning of HBMCN, whereby
multi-level features are extracted from multiple high-level layers and
concatenated to represent a person. Based on three public person re-ID
benchmarks (Market1501, DukeMTMC-reID and CUHK03), experimental results show
that the proposed HBMCN reaches 94.4%, 85.7% and 73.8% in Rank-1, and 85.7%,
74.6% and 69.0% in mAP, achieving a state-of-the-art performance. Further
analysis demonstrates that the specially designed heterogeneous branch performs
better than an isomorphic branch, and multi-level classification provides more
discriminative features compared to single-level classification. As a result,
HBMCN provides substantial further improvements in person re-ID tasks.

paper studies a UAV-aided maritime data collection system with a fixed-wing UAV

energy consumption in completing the task by jointly optimizing the
communication time scheduling among the buoys and the UAV's flight trajectory
subject to wind effect, which is a non-convex problem and difficult to solve
optimally. Existing techniques such as the successive convex approximation
(SCA) method provide efficient sub-optimal solutions for collecting
small/moderate data volume, whereas the solution heavily relies on the
trajectory initialization and has not explicitly considered the wind effect,
while the computational complexity and resulted trajectory complexity both
become prohibitive for the task with large data volume. To this end, we propose
a new cyclical trajectory design framework that can handle arbitrary data
volume efficiently subject to wind effect. Specifically, the proposed UAV
trajectory comprises multiple cyclical laps, each responsible for collecting
only a subset of data and thereby significantly reducing the
computational/trajectory complexity, which allows searching for better
trajectory initialization that fits the buoys' topology and the wind. Numerical
results show that the proposed cyclical scheme outperforms the benchmark
one-flight-only scheme in general. Moreover, the optimized cyclical 8-shape
trajectory can proactively exploit the wind and achieve lower energy
consumption compared with the case without wind.

fundamentally linked to local domain structure and presence of the structural
defects, which both can act as nucleation and pinning centers and create local
electrostatic and mechanical depolarization fields affecting wall dynamics.
However, the general correlative mechanisms between domain structure and
polarization dynamics are only weakly explored, precluding insight into the
associated physical mechanisms. Here, the correlation between local domain
structures and switching behavior in ferroelectric materials is explored using
the convolutional encoder-decoder networks, enabling the image to spectral
(im2spec) and spectral to image (spec2im) translations via encoding latent
variables. The latter reflects the assumption that the relationship between
domain structure and polarization switching is parsimonious, i.e. is based upon
a small number of local mechanisms. The analysis of latent variables
distributions and their real space representations provides insight into the
predictability of the local switching behavior, and hence associated physical
mechanisms. We further pose that the regions where these correlative
relationships are violated, i.e. predictability of the polarization dynamics
from domain structure is reduced, represent the obvious target for detailed
studies, e.g. in the context of automated experiments. This approach provides a
workflow to establish the presence of correlation between local spectral
responses and local structure and can be universally applied to spectral

spectroscopy, and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in scanning
transmission electron microscopy (STEM).

have the potential to reduce drag in wall-bounded turbulent
flows(Gomez-de-Segura & Garcia-Mayoral 2019). This paper extends the resolvent
formulation to study the effect of such anisotropic permeable substrates on
turbulent channel flow. Under the resolvent formulation, the
Fourier-transformed Navier-Stokes equations are interpreted as a linear
forcing-response system. The nonlinear terms are considered the endogenous
forcing in the system that gives rise to a velocity and pressure response. A
gain-based decomposition of the forcing-response transfer function---the
resolvent operator---identifies response modes (resolvent modes) that are known
to reproduce important structural and statistical features of wall-bounded
turbulent flows. The effect of permeable substrates is introduced in this
framework using the Volume-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations and a generalized
form of Darcy's law. Substrates with high streamwise permeability and low
spanwise permeability are found to suppress the forcing-response gain for the
resolvent mode that serves as a surrogate for the energetic near-wall cycle.
This reduction in mode gain is shown to be consistent with the drag reduction
trends predicted by theory and observed in numerical simulations. Simulation
results indicate that drag reduction is limited by the emergence of spanwise
rollers resembling Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices beyond a threshold value of
wall-normal permeability. The resolvent framework also predicts the conditions
in which such energetic spanwise-coherent rollers emerge. These findings
suggest that a limited set of resolvent modes can serve as the building blocks
for computationally-efficient models that enable the design and optimization of
permeable substrates for passive turbulence control.

users bid for priority service. We assume that users at the front of their lane
are requested to declare their delay cost, i.e. value of time, and that users
are serviced in decreasing order of declared delay cost. Since users are
expected to arrive dynamically at traffic intersections, static pricing
approaches may fail to estimate user expected waiting time accurately, and lead
to non-strategyproof payments. To address this gap, we propose two Markov chain
models to determine the expected waiting time of participants in the auction.
Both models take into account the probability of future arrivals at the
intersection. In a first model, we assume that the probability of future
arrivals is uniform across lanes of the intersection. This queue-based model
only tracks the number of lower- and higher-bidding users on access lanes, and
the number of empty lanes. The uniformness assumption is relaxed in a second,
lane-based model which accounts for lane-specific user arrival probabilities at
the expense of an extended state space. We then design a mechanism to determine
incentive-compatible payments in the dynamic sense. The resulting online
mechanisms maximize social welfare in the long run. Numerical experiments on a
four-lane traffic intersection are reported and compared to a static
incentive-compatible mechanism. Our findings show that static
incentive-compatible mechanisms may lead users to misreport their delay costs.
In turn, the proposed online mechanisms are shown to be incentive-compatible in
the dynamic sense.

reconstruction from undersampled k-space data in fast magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI). However, existing deep learning-based image reconstruction
methods typically apply weight-sharing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
k-space data without taking into consideration the k-space data's spatial
frequency properties, leading to ineffective learning of the image
reconstruction models. Moreover, complementary information of spatially
adjacent slices is often ignored in existing deep learning methods. To overcome
such limitations, we develop a deep learning algorithm, referred to as adaptive
convolutional neural networks for k-space data interpolation (ACNN-k-Space),
which adopts a residual Encoder-Decoder network architecture to interpolate the
undersampled k-space data by integrating spatially contiguous slices as
multi-channel input, along with k-space data from multiple coils if available.
The network is enhanced by self-attention layers to adaptively focus on k-space
data at different spatial frequencies and channels. We have evaluated our
method on two public datasets and compared it with state-of-the-art existing
methods. Ablation studies and experimental results demonstrate that our method
effectively reconstructs images from undersampled k-space data and achieves
significantly better image reconstruction performance than current
state-of-the-art techniques.

a treatment on an outcome. Existing confidence intervals for causal effects
based on instrumental variables assume that all of the putative instrumental
variables are valid; a valid instrumental variable is a variable that affects
the outcome only by affecting the treatment and is not related to unmeasured
confounders. However, in practice, some of the putative instrumental variables
are likely to be invalid. This paper presents two tools to conduct valid
inference and tests in the presence of invalid instruments. First, we propose a
simple and general approach to construct confidence intervals based on taking
unions of well-known confidence intervals. Second, we propose a novel test for
the null causal effect based on a collider bias. Our two proposals, especially
when fused together, outperform traditional instrumental variable confidence
intervals when invalid instruments are present, and can also be used as a

distributions, using the Wasserstein distance, that can be used to model
time-varying environments. We can then use these conditions in conjunction with
online stochastic optimization to adapt the decisions. We considers an online

bounds for them under strong convexity, Lipschitzness of the gradient, and
bounds on the probability distribution drift. Further, noting that computing
projections for a general feasible sets might not be amenable to online
implementation (due to computational constraints), we propose an exact penalty
method. Doing so allows us to relax the uniform boundedness of the gradient and
establish dynamic regret bounds for tracking and estimation error. We further

Monte Carlo (DQMC) methods. It is found the spin correlations decay quickly
with the distance, and the local moment is extrapolated to zero in the presence
of symmetry-breaking terms. The results show that the two-band Hubbard chain is
nonmagnetic, which is in contrast to the mean-field calculation predicting a
critical interaction for the magnetic transition. We then include the Hubbard
interaction to the topological-designed GNRs. For large interactions, the spin
correlations keep finite for all distances, and the magnetic order develops.
The local moment is extrapolated to almost zero for weak interactions, and
begins to increase rapidly from a critical interaction. The estimated critical
value is much larger than the realistic value in graphene, and we conclude the
experimentally relevant GNRs is nonmagnetic, which is consistent with the

the effects of foreground contamination, its removal and instrument noise. We
first validate how the foreground residual affects the recovered 21-cm signal

find that the contamination cannot be ignored in the angular autocorrelation
power spectra of HI even when it is small, but has no influence on the accuracy
of the angular cross-power spectra between HI and galaxies. In the
foreground-cleaned map case, as information is lost in the cleaning procedure,
there is also a bias in the cross-correlation power spectrum. However, we found
that the bias from the cross-correlation power spectrum is scale-independent,
which is easily parameterized as part of the model, while the offset in the HI
autocorrelation power spectrum is non-linear. In particular, we tested that the
cross-correlation power also benefits from the cancellation of the bias in the
power spectrum measurement that is induced by the instrument noise, which
changes the shape of the autocorrelation power spectra but leaves the
cross-correlation power unaffected. We then modelled the angular
cross-correlation power spectra to fit the baryon acoustic oscillation feature
in the broad-band shape of the angular cross-correlation power spectrum,
including contamination from the residual foreground and the effect of
instrument noise. We forecast a constraint on the angular diameter distance

from the common usage of Cross Entropy loss function for object classification

but migrated such that LCS became powerful classification techniques. Modern
LCSs can be used to extract building blocks of knowledge to solve more
difficult problems in the same or a related domain. Recent works on LCSs showed
that the knowledge reuse through the adoption of Code Fragments, GP-like
tree-based programs, into LCSs could provide advances in scaling. However,
since solving hard problems often requires constructing high-level building
blocks, which also results in an intractable search space, a limit of scaling
will eventually be reached. Inspired by human problem-solving abilities, XCSCF*
can reuse learned knowledge and learned functionality to scale to complex
problems by transferring them from simpler problems using layered learning.
However, this method was unrefined and suited to only the Multiplexer problem
domain. In this paper, we propose improvements to XCSCF* to enable it to be
robust across multiple problem domains. This is demonstrated on the benchmarks
Multiplexer, Carry-one, Majority-on, and Even-parity domains. The required base
axioms necessary for learning are proposed, methods for transfer learning in
LCSs developed and learning recast as a decomposition into a series of
subordinate problems. Results show that from a conventional tabula rasa, with
only a vague notion of what subordinate problems might be relevant, it is
possible to capture the general logic behind the tested domains, so the
advanced system is capable of solving any individual n-bit Multiplexer, n-bit
Carry-one, n-bit Majority-on, or n-bit Even-parity problem.

faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions. In this paper, we outline three ways
an attacker can steal funds from honest LN users. The attacks require dilating
the time for victims to become aware of new blocks by eclipsing (isolating)
victims from the network and delaying block delivery. While our focus is on the
LN, time-dilation attacks may be relevant to any second-layer protocol that
relies on a timely reaction.
  According to our measurements, it is currently possible to steal the total
channel capacity by keeping a node eclipsed for as little as 2 hours. Since
trust-minimized Bitcoin light clients currently connect to a very limited
number of random nodes, running just 500 Sybil nodes allows an attacker to
Eclipse 47\% of newly deployed light clients (and hence prime them for an
attack). As for the victims running a full node, since they are often used by
large hubs or service providers, an attacker may justify the higher Eclipse
attack cost by stealing all their available liquidity.
  In addition, time-dilation attacks neither require access to hashrate nor
purchasing from a victim. Thus, this class of attacks is a more practical way
of stealing funds via Eclipse attacks than previously anticipated
double-spending.
  We argue that simple detection techniques based on the slow block arrival
alone are not effective, and implementing more sophisticated detection is not
trivial. We suggest that a combination of anti-Eclipse/anti-Sybil measures are
crucial for mitigating time-dilation attacks.

converse is true for finite groups, which settles a conjecture of Breuer,
Guralnick and Kantor from 2008. In fact, we prove a much stronger result, which
solves a problem posed by Brenner and Wiegold in 1975. Namely, if $G$ is a
finite group and every proper quotient of $G$ is cyclic, then for any pair of
nontrivial elements $x_1,x_2 \in G$, there exists $y \in G$ such that $G =
\langle x_1, y \rangle = \langle x_2, y \rangle$. In other words, $s(G)
\geqslant 2$, where $s(G)$ is the spread of $G$. Moreover, if $u(G)$ denotes
the more restrictive uniform spread of $G$, then we can completely characterise
the finite groups $G$ with $u(G) = 0$ and $u(G)=1$. To prove these results, we
first establish a reduction to almost simple groups. For simple groups, the
result was proved by Guralnick and Kantor in 2000 using probabilistic methods
and since then the almost simple groups have been the subject of several
papers. By combining our reduction theorem and this earlier work, it remains to
handle the groups whose socles are exceptional groups of Lie type and this is

the benefits of learning from large-scale external image resources for local

similarities in natural images. Some recent works have successfully leveraged
this intrinsic feature correlation by exploring non-local attention modules.
However, none of the current deep models have studied another inherent property
of images: cross-scale feature correlation. In this paper, we propose the first
Cross-Scale Non-Local (CS-NL) attention module with integration into a
recurrent neural network. By combining the new CS-NL prior with local and
in-scale non-local priors in a powerful recurrent fusion cell, we can find more
cross-scale feature correlations within a single low-resolution (LR) image. The
performance of SISR is significantly improved by exhaustively integrating all
possible priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed CS-NL module by setting new state-of-the-arts on multiple SISR
benchmarks.

the multi-domain controllability is directly achieved by using a domain label.

dissolution rates based on nearest-neighbor interactions to solve the Master
equation for the surface dynamics, and we use an offlattice random walk to
model the Fickian diffusion of the solute particles. The two solvers are
coupled directly through deposition rates of the free particles calculated
using the mean first passage time (MFPT) of deposition that is found to scale
as $r^{-4}$. Two variants are studied: ignoring (radial) and not ignoring the
line of sight (pathfinding). Reference models such as uniform concentration
(random deposition) and lattice diffusion (crystal lattice extended into the
liquid) are used for comparison. We find that the macroscopic limit of the
surface dynamics is reproduced by all models. The free diffusion models produce
a lower equilibrium roughness and a smaller height autocorrelation length than
the reference models, and are found to behave very well in tight confinements.
It is also demonstrated that lattice diffusion does not work well in tight
confinements. The two MFPT models behave very similarly close to equilibrium
and for dissolution, but becomes increasingly different with increasing surface
growth speed. The model is put to use by simulating a cavity with a flux
boundary condition at one side. The conclusion is that the new model excels in
confinement, and line of sight can in practice be ignored since the dominant
deposition sites likely are in line of sight, which minimizes the CPU-time
needed in the coupling.

appearance transformation, we design two novel modules, Semantic-aware
Attentive Transfer (SAT) and Layout Graph Reasoning (LGR), to conduct
intra-part transfer and inter-part reasoning, respectively. SAT module produces
each human part by paying attention to the semantically consistent regions in
the source portrait. It effectively addresses the non-rigid deformation issue
and well preserves the intrinsic structure/appearance with rich texture

graph that connects all relevant part features, where graph reasoning mechanism
is used to propagate information among part nodes to mine their relations. In
this way, LGR module infers invisible body parts and guarantees global

from iterated hard thresholding (IHT) and an estimation step from the
orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP). HTP has been seen to enjoy improved recovery

algorithm, called regularized HTP (RHTP), where the support selection step of
HTP is replaced by a IHT-type support selection where the cost function is
replaced by a regularized cost function, while the estimation step continues to
use the least squares function. With decomposable regularizer, satisfying
certain regularity conditions, the RHTP algorithm is shown to produce a
sequence dynamically equivalent to a sequence evolving according to a HTP-like
evolution, where the identification stage has a gradient premultiplied with a
time-varying diagonal matrix. RHTP is also proven, both theoretically, and

techniques has allowed us to partly beat this limitation. However, image
selection or post-facto image reconstruction methods applied to bursts of
short-exposure images are routinely needed to reach the diffraction limit. Deep
learning has been recently proposed as an efficient way to accelerate these
image reconstructions. Currently, these deep neural networks are trained with
supervision, so that either standard deconvolution algorithms need to be
applied a-priori or complex simulations of the solar magneto-convection need to
be carried out to generate the training sets. Our aim here is to propose a
general unsupervised training scheme that allows multiframe blind deconvolution
deep learning systems to be trained simply with observations. The approach can
be applied for the correction of point-like as well as extended objects.
Leveraging the linear image formation theory and a probabilistic approach to
the blind deconvolution problem produces a physically-motivated loss function.
The optimization of this loss function allows an end-to-end training of a
machine learning model composed of three neural networks. As examples, we apply
this procedure to the deconvolution of stellar data from the FastCam instrument
and to solar extended data from the Swedish Solar Telescope. The analysis
demonstrates that the proposed neural model can be successfully trained without
supervision using observations only. It provides estimations of the
instantaneous wavefronts, from which a corrected image can be found using
standard deconvolution technniques. The network model is roughly three orders
of magnitude faster than applying standard deconvolution based on optimization
and shows potential to be used on real-time at the telescope.

direct them to a hospital or provide emergency medical care. We formalize these
tasks as binary classification and estimation of affected lung percentage.
Though similar problems were well-studied separately, we show that existing
methods provide reasonable quality only for one of these setups. We employ a

attacks. We use hardware performance counters and software events to monitor
activity related to speculative execution, branch prediction, and cache
interference. We use various machine learning models to analyze these events.
These events produce a very distinctive pattern while the system is under
attack; machine learning models are able to detect Meltdown and Spectre attacks
under realistic load conditions with an accuracy of over 99%.

belief change. In descriptor revision, different kinds of change processes are
dealt with in a joint framework. Individual change requirements are qualified
by specific success conditions expressed by a belief descriptor, and belief
descriptors can be combined by logical connectives. This is in contrast to the
currently dominating AGM paradigm shaped by Alchourr\'on, G\""ardenfors, and
Makinson, where different kinds of changes, like a revision or a contraction,
are dealt with separately. In this article, we investigate the realisation of
descriptor revision for a conditional logic while restricting descriptors to
the conjunction of literal descriptors. We apply the principle of conditional
preservation developed by Kern-Isberner to descriptor revision for
conditionals, show how descriptor revision for conditionals under these
restrictions can be characterised by a constraint satisfaction problem, and
implement it using constraint logic programming. Since our conditional logic
subsumes propositional logic, our approach also realises descriptor revision
for propositional logic.

existence of inauthentic actors such as malicious social bots and trolls,
suggesting that not every message is a genuine expression from a legitimate
user. However, the prevalence of inauthentic activities in social data streams
is still unclear, making it difficult to gauge biases of analyses based on such
data. In this paper, we aim to close this gap using Twitter data from the 2018
U.S. midterm elections. Hyperactive accounts are over-represented in volume
samples. We compare their characteristics with those of randomly sampled
accounts and self-identified voters using a fast and low-cost heuristic. We
show that hyperactive accounts are more likely to exhibit various suspicious
behaviors and share low-credibility information compared to likely voters.
Random accounts are more similar to likely voters, although they have slightly
higher chances to display suspicious behaviors. Our work provides insights into
biased voter characterizations when using online observations, underlining the

threat. Specifically, many types of current cyber attacks use URLs for attack
communications (e.g., C\&C, phishing, and spear-phishing). Despite the
continuous progress in detecting these attacks, many alarming problems remain
open, such as the weak spots of the defense mechanisms. Since machine learning
has become one of the most prominent methods of malware detection, A robust
feature selection mechanism is proposed that results in malicious domain
detection models that are resistant to evasion attacks. This mechanism exhibits
high performance based on empirical data. This paper makes two main
contributions: First, it provides an analysis of robust feature selection based
on widely used features in the literature. Note that even though the feature
set dimensional space is reduced by half (from nine to four features), the
performance of the classifier is still improved (an increase in the model's
F1-score from 92.92\% to 95.81\%). Second, it introduces novel features that
are robust to the adversary's manipulation. Based on an extensive evaluation of
the different feature sets and commonly used classification models, this paper
shows that models that are based on robust features are resistant to malicious
perturbations, and at the same time useful for classifying non-manipulated

cosmological parameters, thus FRBs have the potential to be developed into a
new cosmological probe if their data can be largely accumulated in the future.
In this work, we study the capability of future FRB data to improve
cosmological parameter estimation in two dynamical dark energy models. We find
that the simulated FRB data can break the parameter degeneracies inherent in
the current cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Therefore, the combination
of the CMB and FRB data can significantly improve the constraints on the Hubble
constant and dark energy parameters, compared to those using CMB or FRB alone.
If 10,000 FRB events with known redshifts are detected in the future, they
would perform better than the baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data in
breaking the parameter degeneracies inherent in the CMB data. We also find that
the combination of FRB and gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren data provides
an independent low-redshift probe to verify the results from the CMB and BAO
data. For the data combination of CMB, GW, and FRB, it is found that the main
contribution to the constraints comes from the CMB and GW data, but the
inclusion of the FRB data still can evidently improve the constraint on the
baryon density.

original, physical multiscale problem and the corresponding high-dimensional,
one-scale limiting problem can be efficiently treated numerically with the
recently developed quantized tensor-train finite-element method (QTT-FEM).
  The method is based on restricting computation to sequences of nested
subspaces of low dimensions (which are called tensor ranks) within a vast but
generic ""virtual"" (background) discretization space. In the course of
computation, these subspaces are computed iteratively and data-adaptively at

solution of the associated high-dimensional one-scale problem and (ii) the
corresponding approximation to the solution of the multiscale problem admit
efficient approximation by the QTT-FEM. These problems can therefore be
numerically solved in a scale-robust fashion by standard (low-order) PDE

functions of three popular methods for adversarial example generation: the
L-BFGS attack, the Iterative Fast Gradient Sign attack, and Carlini & Wagner's

loss functions underlying the aforementioned attacks while laying out
large-scale experimental results on ImageNet dataset. This analysis exposes (1)
the faster optimization speed as well as the constrained optimization space of
the cross-entropy loss, (2) the detrimental effects of using the signature of
the cross-entropy loss on optimization precision as well as optimization space,
and (3) the slow optimization speed of the logit loss in the context of
adversariality. Our experiments reveal that the Iterative Fast Gradient Sign
attack, which is thought to be fast for generating adversarial examples, is the
worst attack in terms of the number of iterations required to create
adversarial examples in the setting of equal perturbation. Moreover, our
experiments show that the underlying loss function of CW, which is criticized
for being substantially slower than other adversarial attacks, is not that much
slower than other loss functions. Finally, we analyze how well neural networks

mathematical and physical information from such system with the aim to extend
methods or results to other similar physical systems of analogue structure.
  Methods/Analysis: We use these theoretical approaches: relativity of observer
splitting formalism; Lagrangian formalism and Rayleigh potential with a new
integration method; Lyapunov theory os stability.
  Findings: We determined the three-dimensional formulation of the general
relativistic Poynting-Robertson effect model. We determine the analytical form
of the Rayleigh potential and discuss its implications. We prove that the
critical hypersurfaces (regions where there is a balance between gravitational
and radiation forces) are stable configurations.
  Novelty /Improvement: Our new contributions are: to have introduced the
three-dimensional description; to have determined the general relativistic
Rayleigh potential for the first time in the General Relativity literature; to
have provided an alternative, general and more elegant proof of the stability
of the critical hypersurfaces.

the choice of the model during training. Selecting the model using a
training-objective metric such as the least mean squared error does not always
correlate with human perception. In this paper, we propose an objective metric
based on the phone error rate (PER) to select the TTS model with the best
speech intelligibility. The PER is computed between the input text to the TTS
model, and the text decoded from the synthesized speech using an automatic
speech recognition (ASR) model, which is trained on the same data as the TTS
model. With the help of subjective studies, we show that the TTS model chosen
with the least PER on validation split has significantly higher speech
intelligibility compared to the model with the least training-objective metric
loss. Finally, using the proposed PER and subjective evaluation, we show that
the choice of best TTS model depends on the genre of the target domain text.
All our experiments are conducted on a Hindi language dataset. However, the
proposed model selection method is language independent.

  We show that the quotient of the group of automorphisms of the (two-sided)

centre embeds as a particular subgroup $\mathcal{L}_{n}$ of the outer
automorphism group $\mathop{\mathrm{Out}}(G_{n,n-1})$ of $G_{n,n-1}$. It
follows by a result of Ryan that we have the following central extension:
$$\langle \sigma_{n}\rangle \hookrightarrow \mathrm{Aut}(X_n^{\mathbb{N}},
\sigma_{n}) \twoheadrightarrow \mathcal{L}_{n}$$ where here, $\langle
\sigma_{n} \rangle \cong \mathbb{Z}$. We prove that this short exact sequence
splits if and only if $n$ is not a proper power, and, in all cases, we compute
the 2-cocycles and 2-coboundaries for the extension. We also use this central
extension to prove that for $1 \le r < n$, the groups
$\mathop{\mathrm{Out}}(G_{n,r})$ are centreless and have undecidable order
problem.
  Note that the group $\mathop{\mathrm{Out}}(G_{n,n-1})$ consists of finite
transducers (combinatorial objects arising in automata theory), and elements of
the group $\mathcal{L}_{n}$ are easily characterised within
$\mathop{\mathrm{Out}}(G_{n,n-1})$ by a simple combinatorial property. In
particular, the short exact sequence allows us to determine a new and efficient
purely combinatorial representation of elements of
$\mathrm{Aut}(X_n^{\mathbb{N}}, \sigma_{n})$, and we demonstrate how to compute
products using this new representation.

super-resolution (DSR), how to tackle real-world degradation in low-resolution
(LR) depth maps remains a major challenge. Existing DSR model is generally
trained and tested on synthetic dataset, which is very different from what
would get from a real depth sensor. In this paper, we argue that DSR models
trained under this setting are restrictive and not effective in dealing with
real-world DSR tasks. We make two contributions in tackling real-world
degradation of different depth sensors. First, we propose to classify the
generation of LR depth maps into two types: non-linear downsampling with noise
and interval downsampling, for which DSR models are learned correspondingly.
Second, we propose a new framework for real-world DSR, which consists of four
modules : 1) An iterative residual learning module with deep supervision to
learn effective high-frequency components of depth maps in a coarse-to-fine
manner; 2) A channel attention strategy to enhance channels with abundant
high-frequency components; 3) A multi-stage fusion module to effectively
re-exploit the results in the coarse-to-fine process; and 4) A depth refinement
module to improve the depth map by TGV regularization and input loss. Extensive
experiments on benchmarking datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method
over current state-of-the-art DSR methods.

Given that the problem is highly combinatorial, the optimal solution scales
only for small sized problems. Thus, a greedy algorithm is also proposed that
uses a one-step look ahead heuristic search mechanism. In a detailed
evaluation, it is observed that the greedy algorithm has near-optimal
performance as it is on average at 92.06% of the optimal, while it can
potentially scale up to settings with hundreds of drones and locations.

Kaya to bridge these gaps. Kaya has three main functions. Firstly, Kaya
proposes DApp behavior description language (DBDL) to make writing test cases
easier. Test cases written in DBDL can also be automatically executed by Kaya.
Secondly, Kaya supports a flexible and convenient way for test engineers to set
the blockchain pre-states easily. Thirdly, Kaya transforms incomprehensible
addresses into readable variables for easy comprehension. With these functions,
Kaya can help test engineers test DApps more easily. Besides, to fit the
various application environments, we provide two ways for test engineers to use

multi-agent determinantal Q-learning. Our method is established on Q-DPP, an
extension of determinantal point process (DPP) with partition-matroid
constraint to multi-agent setting. Q-DPP promotes agents to acquire diverse
behavioral models; this allows a natural factorization of the joint Q-functions
with no need for \emph{a priori} structural constraints on the value function
or special network architectures. We demonstrate that Q-DPP generalizes major
solutions including VDN, QMIX, and QTRAN on decentralizable cooperative tasks.
To efficiently draw samples from Q-DPP, we adopt an existing
sample-by-projection sampler with theoretical approximation guarantee. The
sampler also benefits exploration by coordinating agents to cover orthogonal
directions in the state space during multi-agent training. We evaluate our
algorithm on various cooperative benchmarks; its effectiveness has been
demonstrated when compared with the state-of-the-art.

$\mu$eV, while comparing it to the performance of a typical helium-3 tube.
Furthermore, it is to characterize differences between the detector
technologies in terms of internal scattering, as well as the time
reconstruction of ~ $\mu$s short neutron pulses. The data were taken at the
Helmholtz Zentrum Berlin, where the Multi-Grid detector and a helium-3 tube
were installed at the ESS test beamline, V20. Using a Fermi-chopper, the
neutron beam of the reactor was chopped into a few tens of $\mu$s wide pulses
before reaching the detector, located a few tens of cm downstream. The data of
the measurements show an agreement between the derived and calculated neutron
detection efficiency curve. The data also provide fine details on the effect of
internal scattering, and how it can be reduced. For the first time, the chopper
resolution was comparable to the timing resolution of the Multi-Grid detector.
This allowed a detailed study of time- and energy resolved effects, as well as
a comparison with a typical helium-3 tube.

analysis. Given a set of pointers, the task is to produce a useful
over-approximation of the memory locations that each pointer may point-to at
runtime. The most common formulation is Andersen's Pointer Analysis (APA),
defined as an inclusion-based set of $m$ pointer constraints over a set of $n$
pointers. Existing algorithms solve APA in $O(n^2\cdot m)$ time, while it has
been conjectured that the problem has no truly sub-cubic algorithm, with a
proof so far having remained elusive.
  In this work we draw a rich fine-grained and parallel complexity landscape of
APA, and present upper and lower bounds. First, we establish an $O(n^3)$
upper-bound for general APA, improving over $O(n^2\cdot m)$ as $n=O(m)$.
Second, we show that even on-demand APA (""may a specific pointer $a$ point to a
specific location $b$?"") has an $\Omega(n^3)$ (combinatorial) lower bound under
standard complexity-theoretic hypotheses. This formally establishes the
long-conjectured ""cubic bottleneck"" of APA, and shows that our $O(n^3)$-time
algorithm is optimal. Third, we show that under mild restrictions, APA is
solvable in $\tilde{O}(n^{\omega})$ time, where $\omega<2.373$ is the
matrix-multiplication exponent. It is believed that $\omega=2+o(1)$, in which
case this bound becomes quadratic. Fourth, we show that even under such
restrictions, even the on-demand problem has an $\Omega(n^2)$ lower bound under
standard complexity-theoretic hypotheses, and hence our algorithm is optimal
when $\omega=2+o(1)$. Fifth, we study the parallelizability of APA and
establish lower and upper bounds: (i) in general, the problem is P-complete and
hence unlikely parallelizable, whereas (ii) under mild restrictions, the
problem is parallelizable. Our theoretical treatment formalizes several
insights that can lead to practical improvements in the future.

solution and its gradient by neural networks through sequential minimizations
of suitable quadratic loss functions that are performed by stochastic gradient
descent. Our main theoretical contribution is to provide an approximation error
analysis of the MDBDP scheme as well as the deep splitting (DS) scheme for

the number of neurons for a class of deep Lipschitz continuous GroupSort neural
networks when the PDE is linear in the gradient of the solution for the MDBDP

further calculates the levels of immunity required for these selfsame lockdown
regimes to begin to work and predicts perceived values, should infections have
been underestimated by a factor of 10. The latter results are compelling. The
first, level-5 lockdown was a valiant attempt to contain the highly infectious,
SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on a limited knowledge. Its basic reproduction number
($r_0 = 1.93$) never came anywhere close to the requirement of being less than
unity. Obviously, it could be anticipated that the same would apply for
subsequent, lower levels of lockdown. The basic reproduction number for the
level-3 lockdown was found to be $2.34$ and that of the level-4 lockdown,
$1.69$.The suggestion is therefore that the level-4 lockdown might have been
marginally `smarter' than the `harder', level-5 lockdown, although its basic
reproduction number may merely reflect an adjustment by the public to the new
normal, or the ever-present error associated with data sets, in general. The
pandemic's basic reproduction number was calculated to be $3.16$, in the
Swedish context. The lockdowns therefore served to ensure that the medical
system was not overwhelmed, bought it valuable time to prepare and provided
useful data. The lockdowns nonetheless failed significantly in meeting any
objective to curtail the pandemic.

timelike boundary is totally geodesic. This provides the first well-posedness
result for this specific geometric boundary condition and the first setting for
which geometric uniqueness in the original sense of Friedrich holds for the
initial boundary value problem. Our proof relies on the ADM system for the
Einstein vacuum equations, formulated with respect to a parallelly propagated
orthonormal frame along timelike geodesics. As an independent result, we first
establish the well-posedness in this gauge of the Cauchy problem for the
Einstein equations, including the propagation of constraints. More precisely,
we show that by appropriately modifying the evolution equations, using the
constraint equations, we can derive a first order symmetric hyperbolic system
for the connection coefficients of the orthonormal frame. The propagation of
the constraints then relies on the derivation of a hyperbolic system involving
the connection, suitably modified Riemann and Ricci curvature tensors and the
torsion of the connection. In particular, the connection is shown to agree with
the Levi-Civita connection at the same time as the validity of the constraints.
In the case of the initial boundary value problem with totally geodesic
boundary, we then verify that the vanishing of the second fundamental form of
the boundary leads to homogeneous boundary conditions for our modified ADM
system, as well as for the hyperbolic system used in the propagation of the
constraints. An additional analytical difficulty arises from a loss of control
on the normal derivatives to the boundary of the solution. To resolve this
issue, we work with an anisotropic scale of Sobolev spaces and exploit the
specific structure of the equations.

20~cm-thick sensitive volume filled with xenon at atmospheric pressure. When
the Compton-scattered photons interact with the xenon, the released
photoelectrons create clouds of secondary ionization, which are imaged using
the electroluminescence produced in a custom-made multi-hole acrylic structure.
Photon-by-photon counting can be achieved by processing the resulting image,
taken in a continuous readout mode. Based on Geant4 simulations, by considering
a realistic detector design and response, we show that photon rates up to at

processed, limited by the spatial diffusion of the photoelectrons in the gas.
Illustratively, if making use of the Rose criterion and assuming the dose

Rayleigh-B\'enard convection in a large box of aspect ratio $\Gamma =32$ for
Rayleigh numbers up to $Ra=10^9$ and at a fixed Prandtl number $Pr=1$. A
conditional averaging technique allows us to extract statistics of the LSC even
though the number and the orientation of the structures vary throughout the
domain. We find that various properties of the LSC obtained here, such as the
wall-shear stress distribution, the boundary layer thicknesses and the wind
Reynolds number, do not differ significantly from results in confined domains
($\Gamma \approx 1$). This is remarkable given that the size of the structures
(as measured by the width of a single convection roll) more than doubles at the
highest $Ra$ as the confinement is removed. An extrapolation towards the
critical shear Reynolds number of $Re_s^{\textrm{crit}} \approx 420$, at which
the boundary layer (BL) typically becomes turbulent, predicts that the
transition to the ultimate regime is expected at $Ra_{\textrm{crit}} \approx
\mathcal{O}(10^{15})$ in unconfined geometries. This result is in line with the
G\""ottingen experimental observations. Furthermore, we confirm that the local
heat transport close to the wall is highest in the plume impacting region,
where the thermal BL is thinnest, and lowest in the plume emitting region,
where the thermal BL is thickest. This trend, however, weakens with increasing

competitive with traditional matched-filtering based methods. A conservative
estimate indicates that our algorithm introduces on average 10.2 s of latency
between signal arrival and generating an alert. We give an exact description of
our testing procedure, which can not only be applied to machine learning based
algorithms but all other search algorithms as well. We thereby improve the

infer a lower limit for the radiated energy of 7.3 x 10^50 erg from the IR
photometry. An extremely energetic supernova would satisfy this budget, but is
ruled out by the radio counterpart evolution. Instead, we propose AT 2017gbl is
related to an accretion event by the central supermassive black hole, where the
spectral signatures originate in the AGN broad line region and the IR
photometry is consistent with re-radiation by polar dust. Given the fast
evolution of AT 2017gbl, we deem a tidal disruption event (TDE) of a star a
more plausible scenario than a dramatic change in the AGN accretion rate. This
makes AT 2017gbl the third TDE candidate to be hosted by a LIRG, in contrast to
the so far considered TDE population discovered at optical wavelengths and
hosted preferably by post-starburst galaxies.

treatment, inpatient equivalent treatment (IET), is offered since 2018. It
should allow service users with severe mental health issues to stay in their
familiar environment during crisis, while being treated in the same complexity

  Kiel",,,,"cs.PL","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","  This thesis investigates effectful declarative programming with an emphasis
on non-determinism as an effect. On the one hand, we are interested in
developing applications using non-determinism as underlying implementation
idea. We discuss two applications using the functional logic programming
language Curry. The key idea of these implementations is to exploit the
interplay of non-determinism and non-strictness that Curry employs. The first
application investigates sorting algorithms parametrised over a comparison
function. By applying a non-deterministic predicate to these sorting functions,
we gain a permutation enumeration function. We compare the implementation in
Curry with an implementation in Haskell that uses a monadic interface to model
non-determinism. The other application that we discuss in this work is a
library for probabilistic programming. Instead of modelling distributions as
list of event and probability pairs, we model distributions using Curry's
built-in non-determinism. In both cases we observe that the combination of
non-determinism and non-strictness has advantages over an implementation using
lists to model non-determinism. On the other hand, we present an idea to apply
formal reasoning on effectful declarative programming languages. In order to
start with simple effects, we focus on modelling a functional subset first.
That is, the effects of interest are totality and partiality. We then observe
that the general scheme to model these two effects can be generalised to
capture a wide range of effects. Obviously, the next step is to apply the idea
to model non-determinism. More precisely, we implement a model for the
non-determinism of Curry: non-strict non-determinism with call-time choice.
Therefore, we finally discuss why the current representation models
call-by-name rather than Curry's call-by-need semantics and give an outlook on
ideas to tackle this problem.

principles of their design. Inspired by the hierarchically organized
scaffolding networks found in plant leaves, here we model networks of bending
beams that capture the discrete and non-uniform nature of natural materials.
Using the principle of maximal rigidity under natural resource constraints, we
show that optimal discrete beam networks reproduce the structural features of
real leaf venation. Thus, in addition to its ability to efficiently transport
water and nutrients, the venation network also optimizes leaf rigidity using
the same hierarchical reticulated network topology. We study the phase space of
optimal mechanical networks, providing concrete guidelines for the construction
of elastic structures. We implement these natural design rules by fabricating
efficient, biologically inspired metamaterials.

experimental conditions for supporting this third assumption are known in the
literature as ""freedom-of-choice loophole"" (FOCL). In a recent publication,
Abell\'an et al [2018] address this problem and follow this same strategy
embraced by Bell [2004]. Nevertheless, the possibility of human freedom of
choice has been a matter of philosophical debate for more than 2000 years, and
there is no consensus among philosophers on this topic. If human choice is not
free, Bell's solution would not be sufficient to close FOCL. Therefore, in
order to support the basic assumption of this experiment, it is necessary to
argue that human choice is indeed free. In this paper, we present a Kantian
position on this topic and defend the view that this philosophical position is
the best way to ensure that BigBell Test (Abell\'an et al. [2018]) can in fact

location-based services but also for improving wireless communication
performance in various ways such as channel estimation, beam alignment, medium

advancement of communication technologies also brings new opportunities to
greatly improve the localization performance, as exemplified by the anticipated
centimeter-level localization accuracy in 6G by ultra massive MIMO and mmWave

  Identifier-Based Information Centric Networks","submitted to Journal of Network and Computer Applications",,,,"cs.NI","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Information Centric Networks (ICNs) have emerged in recent years as a new
networking paradigm for the next-generation Internet. The primary goal of these
networks is to provide effective mechanisms for content distribution and
retrieval based on in-network content caching. The design of different ICN
architectures addressed many of the security issues found in the traditional
Internet. Therefore, allowing for a secure, reliable, and scalable
communication over the Internet. However, recent research studies showed that
these architectures are vulnerable to different types of DDoS attacks. In this
paper, we propose a defense mechanism against distributed denial of service
attacks (DDoS) in path-identifier based information centric networks. The
proposed mechanism, called LogDos, performs GET Message logging based filtering
and employs Bloom filter based logging to store incoming GET messages such that
corresponding content messages are verified, while filtering packets
originating from malicious hosts. We develop three versions of LogDos with
varying levels of storage overhead at LogDos-enabled router. Extensive
simulation experiments show that LogDos is very effective against DDoS attacks
as it can filter more than 99.98 % of attack traffic in different attack
scenarios while incurring acceptable storage overhead.

improve accuracy, provide generalization error estimates, and enable active

potentials based on artificial neural networks. Instead of a single model,
multiple models that share the same atomic environment descriptors yield an
average that outperforms its individual members as well as a measure of the
generalization error in the form of the committee disagreement. We not only use
this disagreement to identify the most relevant configurations to build up the
model's training set in an active learning procedure, but also monitor and bias
it during simulations to control the generalization error. This facilitates the
adaptive development of committee neural network potentials and their training
sets, while keeping the number of ab initio calculations to a minimum. To
illustrate the benefits of this methodology, we apply it to the development of
a committee model for water in the condensed phase. Starting from a single
reference ab initio simulation, we use active learning to expand into new state
points and to describe the quantum nature of the nuclei. The final model,
trained on 814 reference calculations, yields excellent results under a range
of conditions, from liquid water at ambient and elevated temperatures and
pressures to different phases of ice, and the air-water interface - all
including nuclear quantum effects. This approach to committee models will
enable the systematic development of robust machine learning models for a broad

Stochastic Verhulst model with time-dependent parameters, where the volatility
process follows the dynamics $dV_t = \kappa_t (\theta_t - V_t) V_t dt +
\lambda_t V_t dB_t$. Our methodology involves writing the put option price as
an expectation of a Black-Scholes formula, reparameterising the volatility
process and then performing a number of expansions. The difficulties faced are
computing a number of expectations induced by the expansion procedure
explicitly. We do this by appealing to techniques from Malliavin calculus.
Moreover, we deduce that our methodology extends to models with more general
drift and diffusion coefficients for the volatility process. We obtain the
explicit representation of the form of the error generated by the expansion
procedure, and we provide sufficient ingredients in order to obtain a
meaningful bound. Under the assumption of piecewise-constant parameters, our
approximation formulas become closed-form, and moreover we are able to
establish a fast calibration scheme. Furthermore, we perform a numerical
sensitivity analysis to investigate the quality of our approximation formula in
the Stochastic Verhulst model, and show that the errors are well within the
acceptable range for application purposes.

manipulators share their workspace and work together, robots have to be
equipped with important capabilities to guarantee human safety. The robots have
to recognize possible collisions with the human co-worker and react
anticipatorily by adapting their motion to avert dangerous situations while
they are executing their task.
  Therefore, methods have been developed that allow to monitor the workspace of
mobile manipulators using multiple depth sensors to gather information about
the robot environment. This encompasses both 3D information about obstacles in
the close robot surroundings and the prediction of obstacle motions in the
entire monitored space. Based on this information, a collision-free robot
motion is planned and during the execution the robot continuously reacts to
unforeseen dangerous situations by adapting its planned motion, slowing down or
stopping.
  For the demonstration of a manufacturing scenario, the developed methods have
been implemented on a prototypical mobile manipulator. The algorithms handle
both robot platform and manipulator in a uniform manner so that an overall
optimization of the path and of the collision avoidance behavior is possible.
By integrating the monitoring, planning, and interaction control components,
the task of grasping, placing and delivering objects to humans in a shared

transition probabilities to the continuum. The existence of a 1- resonance at
low excitation energies is confirmed, but the associated E1 transition from the
ground state does not have an isoscalar character, as suggested in a recent
experiment. In a second step, I study the 11Li + p elastic cross section at
Elab = 66 MeV in the CDCC framework. I obtain a fair agreement with experiment,
and show that breakup effects are maximal at large angles. The breakup cross
section is shown to be dominated by the 1- dipole state in 11Li, but the role
of this resonance is minor in elastic scattering. From CDCC equivalent 11Li + p
and 11Li + n potentials, I explore the 11Li + d cross section within a standard
three-body 11Li +(p + n) model. At small angles, the experimental cross section
is close to the Rutherford scattering cross section, which is not supported by
the CDCC. A five-body (9Li+n+n)+(p+n) is then performed. Including breakup
states in 11Li and in the deuteron represents a numerical challenge for theory,
owing to the large number of channels. Although a full convergence could not be
reached, the CDCC model tends to overestimate the data at small angles. I
suggest that measurements of the 9Li + p elastic scattering would be helpful to
determine more accurate optical potentials. The current disagreement between

more realistic assumption is that an individual is removed at a certain time

pandemic behavior, it is instructive in that many of the fundamental dynamics
and descriptors of pandemics are clearly and simply defined. The logistic model
is generally used descriptively, dealing as it does with only the susceptible

presents a full but modified SIR model with a simpler logistic solution which

normalized pair interaction energy, where the `sticky disk' interaction
potential models the atoms as hard spheres that interact when they are
tangential. The discrete energy is frame invariant and no underlying reference
lattice on the atomistic configurations is assumed. By means of
$\Gamma$-convergence, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of configurations
with finite surface energy scaling in the infinite particle limit. The
effective continuum theory is described in terms of a piecewise constant field
delineating the local orientation and micro-translation of the configuration.
The limiting energy is local and concentrated on the grain boundaries, i.e., on
the boundaries of the zones where the underlying microscopic configuration has
constant parameters. The corresponding surface energy density depends on the
relative orientation of the two grains, their microscopic translation misfit,
and the normal to the interface. We further provide a fine analysis of the
surface energies at grain boundaries both for vacuum-solid and solid-solid
phase transitions. The latter relies fundamentally on a structure result for
grain boundaries showing that due to the extremely brittle setup interpolating
boundary layers near cracks are energetically not favorable.

MIL models. In this paper, we study the effect of different MIL pooling filters
on the performance of MIL models in real world MIL tasks. We designed a neural
network based MIL framework with 5 different MIL pooling filters: `max',
`mean', `attention', `distribution' and `distribution with attention'. We also
formulated 5 different MIL tasks on a real world lymph node metastases dataset.
We found that the performance of our framework in a task is different for
different filters. We also observed that the performances of the five pooling
filters are also different from task to task. Hence, the selection of a correct
MIL pooling filter for each MIL task is crucial for better performance.
Furthermore, we noticed that models with `distribution' and `distribution with
attention' pooling filters consistently perform well in almost all of the
tasks. We attribute this phenomena to the amount of information captured by
`distribution' based pooling filters. While point estimate based pooling
filters, like `max' and `mean', produce point estimates of distributions,
`distribution' based pooling filters capture the full information in
distributions. Lastly, we compared the performance of our neural network model
with `distribution' pooling filter with the performance of the best MIL methods

classification task where each input consists of one sentence of text. It is
nevertheless clear that useful information for the task can often be found
outside of the scope of a single-sentence context. Recently proposed
self-attention models such as BERT can both efficiently capture long-distance
relationships in input as well as represent inputs consisting of several
sentences, creating new opportunitites for approaches that incorporate
cross-sentence information in natural language processing tasks. In this paper,
we present a systematic study exploring the use of cross-sentence information
for NER using BERT models in five languages. We find that adding context in the
form of additional sentences to BERT input systematically increases NER
performance on all of the tested languages and models. Including multiple
sentences in each input also allows us to study the predictions of the same
sentences in different contexts. We propose a straightforward method,
Contextual Majority Voting (CMV), to combine different predictions for
sentences and demonstrate this to further increase NER performance with BERT.
Our approach does not require any changes to the underlying BERT architecture,
rather relying on restructuring examples for training and prediction.
Evaluation on established datasets, including the CoNLL'02 and CoNLL'03 NER
benchmarks, demonstrates that our proposed approach can improve on the
state-of-the-art NER results on English, Dutch, and Finnish, achieves the best

better understand the structure and frequency of heatwaves in a changing
climate. Here, we study annual temperature maxima over Southern Europe using a
century-spanning dataset observed at 44 monitoring stations. Extending the
spectral representation of max-stable processes, our modeling framework relies
on a novel construction of max-infinitely divisible processes, which include
covariates to capture spatio-temporal non-stationarities. Our new model keeps a
popular max-stable process on the boundary of the parameter space, while
flexibly capturing weakening extremal dependence at increasing quantile levels
and asymptotic independence. This is achieved by linking the overall magnitude
of a spatial event to its spatial correlation range, in such a way that more
extreme events become less spatially dependent, thus more localized. Our model
reveals salient features of the spatio-temporal variability of European
temperature extremes, and it clearly outperforms natural alternative models.
Results show that the spatial extent of heatwaves is smaller for more severe
events at higher altitudes, and that recent heatwaves are moderately wider. Our
probabilistic assessment of the 2019 annual maxima confirms the severity of the
2019 heatwaves both spatially and at individual sites, especially when compared
to climatic conditions prevailing in 1950-1975.

tangent spaces on the surface. We implement our approach for triangle meshes.
Based on circular harmonic functions, we introduce convolution filters for

showing that any time-independent measure on the space of models of the

The neural networks are usually trained by tuning the weights to directly
minimise a given loss function. In this paper we propose to re-parameterise the
weights into targets for the firing strengths of the individual nodes in the
network. Given a set of targets, it is possible to calculate the weights which
make the firing strengths best meet those targets. It is argued that using
targets for training addresses the problem of exploding gradients, by a process
which we call cascade untangling, and makes the loss-function surface smoother
to traverse, and so leads to easier, faster training, and also potentially
better generalisation, of the neural network. It also allows for easier
learning of deeper and recurrent network structures. The necessary conversion
of targets to weights comes at an extra computational expense, which is in many
cases manageable. Learning in target space can be combined with existing
neural-network optimisers, for extra gain. Experimental results show the speed
of using target space, and examples of improved generalisation, for
fully-connected networks and convolutional networks, and the ability to recall

photoelectron spectra generated by the linearly polarised twisted pulse with
different OAM values exhibit angular modulations, whereas circularly polarised
twisted pulse yields angular isotropic spectra. It is demonstrated that the
energy- and angle-resolved streaking spectra are sensitive to the OAM values of

comprehensive inference, but the effect of partial misspecification of the
model is a concern. One approach in this setting is to modularize the model,
and prevent feedback from suspect modules, using a cut model. After observing
data, this leads to the cut distribution which normally does not have a
closed-form. Previous studies have proposed algorithms to sample from this
distribution, but these algorithms have unclear theoretical convergence
properties. To address this, we propose a new algorithm called the Stochastic
Approximation Cut algorithm (SACut) as an alternative. The algorithm is divided
into two parallel chains. The main chain targets an approximation to the cut
distribution; the auxiliary chain is used to form an adaptive proposal
distribution for the main chain. We prove convergence of the samples drawn by
the proposed algorithm and present the exact limit. Although SACut is biased,
since the main chain does not target the exact cut distribution, we prove this
bias can be reduced geometrically by increasing a user-chosen tuning parameter.
In addition, parallel computing can be easily adopted for SACut, which greatly
reduces computation time.

or countries which are similar in their populations, medical infrastructures,
and people's behavior? Why are forecasts or predictions made by so-called
experts often grossly wrong, concerning the numbers of people who get infected
or die? The purpose of this study is to better understand the stochastic nature
of an epidemic disease, and answer the above questions. Much of the work on
infectious diseases has been based on ""SIR deterministic models,"" (Kermack and
McKendrick:1927.) We will explore stochastic models that can capture the
essence of the seemingly erratic behavior of an infectious disease. A
stochastic model, in its formulation, takes into account the random nature of
an infectious disease.
  The stochastic model we study here is based on the ""birth-and-death process
with immigration"" (BDI for short), which was proposed in the study of
population growth or extinction of some biological species. The BDI process
model ,however, has not been investigated by the epidemiology community. The
BDI process is one of a few birth-and-death processes, which we can solve
analytically. Its time-dependent probability distribution function is a
""negative binomial distribution"" with its parameter $r$ less than $1$. The
""coefficient of variation"" of the process is larger than $\sqrt{1/r} > 1$.
Furthermore, it has a long tail like the zeta distribution. These properties
explain why infection patterns exhibit enormously large variations. The number
of infected predicted by a deterministic model is much greater than the median
of the distribution. This explains why any forecast based on a deterministic
model will fail more often than not.

  LNCS 12160",,,,"cs.DS","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Treewidth is a measure of how tree-like a graph is. It has many important
algorithmic applications because many NP-hard problems on general graphs become
tractable when restricted to graphs of bounded treewidth. Algorithms for
problems on graphs of bounded treewidth mostly are dynamic programming
algorithms using the structure of a tree decomposition of the graph. The
bottleneck in the worst-case run time of these algorithms often is the
computations for the so called join nodes in the associated nice tree
decomposition.
  In this paper, we review two different approaches that have appeared in the
literature about computations for the join nodes: one using fast zeta and
M\""obius transforms and one using fast Fourier transforms. We combine these
approaches to obtain new, faster algorithms for a broad class of vertex subset
problems known as the [\sigma,\rho]-domination problems. Our main result is
that we show how to solve [\sigma,\rho]-domination problems in $O(s^{t+2} t n^2
(t\log(s)+\log(n)))$ arithmetic operations. Here, t is the treewidth, s is the
(fixed) number of states required to represent partial solutions of the
specific [\sigma,\rho]-domination problem, and n is the number of vertices in
the graph. This reduces the polynomial factors involved compared to the
previously best time bound (van Rooij, Bodlaender, Rossmanith, ESA 2009) of $O(
s^{t+2} (st)^{2(s-2)} n^3 )$ arithmetic operations. In particular, this removes
the dependence of the degree of the polynomial on the fixed number of

uses the encoded context representation to predict a sentiment label for the

we introduce an inconsistency loss to penalize the disagreement between these
two classifiers. It helps the decoder to generate a summary to have a
consistent sentiment tendency with the review and also helps the two sentiment
classifiers learn from each other. Experiment results on four real-world
datasets from different domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our model.

Capability machines are a special type of processors that include better
security primitives at the hardware level. In capability machines, every word
has an associated tag bit that indicates whether the value it contains is a
capability or a regular data value. Capabilities enable fine-grained control of
the authority over memory that program components have. Conceptually,
capabilities can be viewed as being an unforgeable token carrying authority
over a resource. CHERI is a recently developed capability machine that aims to
provide fine-grained memory protection, software compartmentalization and
backwards compatibility. While our ideas are implemented on CHERI, they are not
limited to it and should be applicable to other capability machines as well. In
this technical report we propose a new type of capabilities, which represent
the authority to access (read and write to) a block of memory but not view its
initial contents. Our main goal is to use this new type of capability as part
of a secure calling convention, but other applications may be possible too.

  Combinatorial Optimization",,,,,"cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Combinatorial optimization has found applications in numerous fields, from
aerospace to transportation planning and economics. The goal is to find an
optimal solution among a finite set of possibilities. The well-known challenge
one faces with combinatorial optimization is the state-space explosion problem:
the number of possibilities grows exponentially with the problem size, which
makes solving intractable for large problems. In the last years, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown its promise for designing good
heuristics dedicated to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.
However, current approaches have two shortcomings: (1) they mainly focus on the
standard travelling salesman problem and they cannot be easily extended to
other problems, and (2) they only provide an approximate solution with no
systematic ways to improve it or to prove optimality. In another context,
constraint programming (CP) is a generic tool to solve combinatorial
optimization problems. Based on a complete search procedure, it will always
find the optimal solution if we allow an execution time large enough. A
critical design choice, that makes CP non-trivial to use in practice, is the
branching decision, directing how the search space is explored. In this work,
we propose a general and hybrid approach, based on DRL and CP, for solving
combinatorial optimization problems. The core of our approach is based on a
dynamic programming formulation, that acts as a bridge between both techniques.
We experimentally show that our solver is efficient to solve two challenging
problems: the traveling salesman problem with time windows, and the 4-moments
portfolio optimization problem. Results obtained show that the framework
introduced outperforms the stand-alone RL and CP solutions, while being
competitive with industrial solvers.

designed for learning pseudodifferential operators ($\Psi$DOs) in the context
of linear inverse problems. Our starting point is the Iterative Soft
Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA), a well-known algorithm to solve
sparsity-promoting minimization problems. We show that, under rather general
assumptions on the forward operator, the unfolded iterations of ISTA can be
interpreted as the successive layers of a CNN, which in turn provides fairly
general network architectures that, for a specific choice of the parameters
involved, allow to reproduce ISTA, or a perturbation of ISTA for which we can
bound the coefficients of the filters. Our case study is the limited-angle
X-ray transform and its application to limited-angle computed tomography
(LA-CT). In particular, we prove that, in the case of LA-CT, the operations of
upscaling, downscaling and convolution, which characterize our $\Psi$DONet and
most deep learning schemes, can be exactly determined by combining the
convolutional nature of the limited angle X-ray transform and basic properties
defining an orthogonal wavelet system. We test two different implementations of
$\Psi$DONet on simulated data from limited-angle geometry, generated from the
ellipse data set. Both implementations provide equally good and noteworthy
preliminary results, showing the potential of the approach we propose and
paving the way to applying the same idea to other convolutional operators which
are $\Psi$DOs or Fourier integral operators.

Despite the abundance of the currently proliferated generic KGs, there is a
vital need to construct domain-specific KGs. Further, quality and credibility
should be assimilated in the process of constructing and augmenting KGs,
particularly those propagated from mixed-quality resources such as social media
data. This paper presents a novel credibility domain-based KG Embedding
framework. This framework involves capturing a fusion of data obtained from
heterogeneous resources into a formal KG representation depicted by a domain

repositories to enrich the semantics of the textual contents, thereby
facilitating the interoperability of information. The proposed framework also
embodies a credibility module to ensure data quality and trustworthiness. The
constructed KG is then embedded in a low-dimension semantically-continuous
space using several embedding techniques. The utility of the constructed KG and
its embeddings is demonstrated and substantiated on link prediction,
clustering, and visualisation tasks.

something from an image by describing its visual appearance and spatial
location, but in practice, we often ask for an object by describing its
affordance or other non-visual attributes, especially when we do not have a
precise target. For example, sometimes we say 'Give me something to eat'. In
this case, we need to use commonsense knowledge to identify the objects in the
image. Unfortunately, these is no existing referring expression dataset
reflecting this requirement, not to mention a model to tackle this challenge.
In this paper, we collect a new referring expression dataset, called KB-Ref,
containing 43k expressions on 16k images. In KB-Ref, to answer each expression
(detect the target object referred by the expression), at least one piece of
commonsense knowledge must be required. We then test state-of-the-art (SoTA)
REF models on KB-Ref, finding that all of them present a large drop compared to
their outstanding performance on general REF datasets. We also present an

The mapping is exact in the hypothetical case without oscillations, and holds
to a very good accuracy in the real case with oscillations. We then analyze the
sensitivity to mass ordering of JUNO (and its precision oscillometry
capabilities) assuming a single reference spectrum, as well as bundles of
variant spectra, as obtained by changing nuclear input uncertainties in
summation calculations from a publicly available toolkit. We show through a
chi-squared analysis that variant spectra induce little reduction of the
sensitivity in JUNO, especially when TAO constraints are included. Subtle
aspects of the statistical analysis of variant spectra are also discussed.

and evolve in a social context - traditionally uses agent-based models to
validate the implications of sociological theories. These models encode the
causal mechanism that drives the opinion formation process, and have the
advantage of being easy to interpret. However, as they do not exploit the
availability of data, their predictive power is limited. Moreover, parameter
calibration and model selection are manual and difficult tasks.
  In this work we propose an inference mechanism for fitting a generative,
agent-like model of opinion dynamics to real-world social traces. Given a set
of observables (e.g., actions and interactions between agents), our model can
recover the most-likely latent opinion trajectories that are compatible with
the assumptions about the process dynamics. This type of model retains the
benefits of agent-based ones (i.e., causal interpretation), while adding the
ability to perform model selection and hypothesis testing on real data.
  We showcase our proposal by translating a classical agent-based model of
opinion dynamics into its generative counterpart. We then design an inference
algorithm based on online expectation maximization to learn the latent
parameters of the model. Such algorithm can recover the latent opinion
trajectories from traces generated by the classical agent-based model. In
addition, it can identify the most likely set of macro parameters used to
generate a data trace, thus allowing testing of sociological hypotheses.
Finally, we apply our model to real-world data from Reddit to explore the
long-standing question about the impact of backfire effect. Our results suggest
a low prominence of the effect in Reddit's political conversation.

quality of the end-user experience. This implies compliance with key
performance indicators (KPIs) required by applications. Key performance
indicators at the application level are throughput, download time, round trip
time, and video delay. They depend on the end-to-end connection between the
server and the end-user device. For VHC networks, Telco operators must provide
the required application quality. Moreover, they must meet the objectives of
economic sustainability. Today, Telco operators rarely achieve the above
objectives, mainly due to the push to increase the bit-rate of access networks
without considering the end-to-end KPIs of the applications. The main
contribution of this paper concerns the definition of a deployment framework to
address performance and cost issues for VHC networks. We show three actions on
which it is necessary to focus. First, limiting bit-rate through video
compression. Second, contain the rate of packet loss through artificial
intelligence algorithms for line stabilization. Third, reduce latency (i.e.,
round-trip time) with edge-cloud computing. The concerted and gradual
application of these measures can allow a Telco to get out of the
ultra-broadband ""trap"" of the access network, as defined in the paper. We
propose to work on end-to-end optimization of the bandwidth utilization ratio.
This leads to a better performance experienced by the end-user. It also allows
a Telco operator to create new business models and obtain new revenue streams
at a sustainable cost. To give a clear example, we describe how to realize
mobile virtual and augmented reality, which is one of the most challenging
future services.

microbes, equipped with ATP-fueled engines, are prime examples of such
phase-separating active matter, which is fundamental in myriad biological
processes. The fact that spontaneous spatial aggregation is not widely
recognized as a general feature of microbial communities challenges the
generalisation of phase separation beyond artificial active systems. Here, we
report on the phase separation of populations of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that
can be controlled by light in a fully reversible manner. We trace this
phenomenon back to the light- and density-dependent motility, thus bridging the
gap from light perception on the single-cell level to collective spatial
self-organization into regions of high and low density. Its spectral
sensitivity suggests that microbial motility and phase separation are regulated
by the activity of the photosynthetic machinery. Characteristic fingerprints of
the stability and dynamics of this active system paint a picture that cannot be
reconciled with the current physical understanding of phase separation in
artificial active matter, whereby collective behavior can emerge from inherent
motility modulation in response to changing stimuli. Our results therefore
point towards the existence of a broader class of self-organization phenomena

refractive index have a value of index that is of order unity. Surprisingly,
though, a deep understanding of the mechanisms that lead to this universal
behavior seems to be lacking. Moreover, this observation is difficult to
reconcile with the fact that a single, isolated atom is known to have a giant
optical response, as characterized by a resonant scattering cross section that
far exceeds its physical size. Here, we theoretically and numerically
investigate the evolution of the optical properties of an ensemble of ideal
atoms as a function of density, starting from the dilute gas limit, including
the effects of multiple scattering and near-field interactions. Interestingly,
despite the giant response of an isolated atom, we find that the maximum index
does not indefinitely grow with increasing density, but rather reaches a
limiting value $n\approx 1.7$. We propose an explanation based upon
strong-disorder renormalization group theory, in which the near-field
interaction combined with random atomic positions results in an inhomogeneous
broadening of atomic resonance frequencies. This mechanism ensures that
regardless of the physical atomic density, light at any given frequency only
interacts with at most a few near-resonant atoms per cubic wavelength, thus
limiting the maximum index attainable. Our work is a promising first step to
understand the limits of refractive index from a bottom-up, atomic physics
perspective, and also introduces renormalization group as a powerful tool to
understand the generally complex problem of multiple scattering of light
overall.

shortcomings of existing arithmetic units and extends their expressivity. We
achieve this by using complex arithmetic without requiring a conversion of the

a highly transparent model. We show that the NPUs outperform their competitors

to the temperature. We assume that one can act on the velocity and the
temperature on an arbitrary small part of the boundary. The proof relies on

an event with its past few events by analyzing the distribution of the events
when applying different functions on the spatial distances. We find the best
function to check the spatio-temporal correlation for an event for
\emph{SeqXFilter}, best separating real events and noise events. We not only
give the visual denoising effect of the filter but also use two metrics for
quantitatively analyzing the filter's performance. Four neuromorphic
event-based datasets, recorded from four DVS with different output sizes, are
used for validation of our method. The experimental results show that
\emph{SeqXFilter} achieves similar performance as baseline NNb filters, but

STORM-Compositional is a single loop algorithm that avoids the typical
alternative tuning between large and small batch sizes, as well as recording of
checkpoint gradients, that persist in variance-reduced stochastic gradient
methods. This allows considerably simpler parameter tuning in numerical
experiments, which demonstrates the superiority of STORM-Compositional over

because the radio emission of steep NLS1s is dominated by misaligned jets,

the radio emission of flat NLS1s may be produced by a central core which has
not yet developed radio jets and outflows. We discover new NLS1s harboring

distributions (generalized Lorentzian probability distributions known as
$\kappa$-distributions) which are frequently observed particularly in high
temperature plasmas. The general expression of the partition function in such
systems is given as well in a form similar to the Boltzmann-Gibbs probability
distribution, including a possible exponential high energy truncation. We find
the representation of the mean energy as function of probability, and provide
the implicit form of Olbert (Lorentzian) entropy as well as its high
temperature limit. The relation to phase space density of states is obtained.
We then find the entropy as function of probability, an expression which is
fundamental to statistical mechanics and here to its Olbertian version.
Lorentzian systems through internal collective interactions cause correlations
which add to the entropy. Fermi systems do not obey Olbert statistics, while
Bose systems might at temperatures sufficiently far from zero.

show that for certain objective functions, DeePC exhibits strong out-of-sample

The algorithm provides an end-to-end approach to control design for unknown

quantities describing energetic charged particle transport. There are three
different definitions for the SPDC, i.e., the Displacement Variance definition
$\kappa_{zz}^{DV}=\lim_{t\rightarrow t_{\infty}}d\sigma^2/(2dt)$, the Fick's
Law definition $\kappa_{zz}^{FL}=J/X$ with $X=\partial{F}/\partial{z}$, and the
TGK formula definition $\kappa_{zz}^{TGK}=\int_0^{\infty}dt \langle
v_z(t)v_z(0) \rangle$. For constant mean magnetic field, the three different
definitions of the SPDC give the same result. However, for focusing field it is
demonstrated that the results of the different definitions are not the same. In
this paper, from the Fokker-Planck equation we find that different methods,
e.g., the general Fourier expansion and perturbation theory, can give the
different Equations of the Isotropic Distribution Function (EIDFs). But it is
shown that one EIDF can be transformed into another by some Derivative
Iterative Operations (DIOs). If one definition of the SPDC is invariant for the
DIOs, it is clear that the definition is also an invariance for different
EIDFs, therewith it is an invariant quantity for the different Derivation
Methods of EIDF (DMEs). For the focusing field we suggest that the TGK
definition $\kappa_{zz}^{TGK}$ is only the approximate formula, and the Fick's
Law definition $\kappa_{zz}^{FL}$ is not invariant to some DIOs. However, at
least for the special condition, in this paper we show that the definition
$\kappa_{zz}^{DV}$ is the invariant quantity to the kinds of the DIOs.
Therefore, for spatially varying field the displacement variance definition
$\kappa_{zz}^{DV}$, rather than the Fick's law definition $\kappa_{zz}^{FL}$
and TGK formula definition $\kappa_{zz}^{TGK}$, is the most appropriate
definition of the SPDCs.

and propose two CSL algorithms (i.e., mCSLSACC and vCSLACC) which exploit
antenna cross-correlations, where the mCSLSACC utilizes an antenna averaging
temporal decomposition, and the vCSLACC uses a spatial-temporal joint
decomposition. For both algorithms, the conditions of statistical covariance
matrices (SCMs) without noise corruption are derived. Through establishing the
singular value relation of SCMs in statistical sense between the proposed and
traditional CSL algorithms, we show the superiority of the proposed CSL
algorithms. By further depicting the receiving correlation matrix of MIMO
channel with the exponential correlation model, we give important closed-form
expressions for the proposed CSL algorithms in terms of the amplification of
singular values over traditional CSL algorithms. Such expressions provide a
possibility to determine optimal algorithm parameters for high system

stability of JFC analogs in the 55 Cnc system is much shorter compared to
comets in the Solar System owing to profound differences in the planetary
structure of the systems. For example, between planet 55 Cnc-f and 55~Cnc-d,
the comets do not undergo close cometary encounters akin to Earth and Mars in
the Solar System as the planetary masses in the 55 Cnc system are much larger
than in the Solar System and therefore the comets are much less orbitally
stable. Nevertheless, we expect an increased number of comet-planet encounters

additional theoretical studies are required to shed light on the possibility of

gets much broader, exposing more and more vulnerabilities to attackers.
Traditional mitigation-based defence strategies are challenging to cope with
the current complicated situation. Security practitioners urgently need better
tools to describe and modelling attacks for defence.
  The provenance graph seems like an ideal method for threat modelling with
powerful semantic expression ability and attacks historic correlation ability.
In this paper, we firstly introduce the basic concepts about system-level
provenance graph and proposed typical system architecture for provenance
graph-based threat detection and investigation. A comprehensive provenance
graph-based threat detection system can be divided into three modules, namely,
""data collection module"", ""data management module"", and ""threat detection
modules"". Each module contains several components and involves many research
problem. We systematically analyzed the algorithms and design details involved.
By comparison, we give the strategy of technology selection. Moreover, we
pointed out the shortcomings of the existing work for future improvement.

they were born in a corrugated disk of molecular clouds, similar to that
inferred from the current filamentary molecular cloud distribution and dust
extinction maps. Multiple spiral arm features with different but near
corotation pattern speeds and at different heights could account for the
stellar association birth sites. We find that the young stellar associations
are located in between peaks in the UV stellar velocity distribution for stars
in the solar neighborhood. This would be expected if they were born in a spiral
arm which perturbs stellar orbits that cross it. In contrast, stellar
associations seem to be located near peaks in the vertical phase space
distribution, suggesting that the gas in which stellar associations are born
moves vertically together with the low velocity dispersion disk stars.

described by an Enskog--Fokker--Planck equation. The analysis is carried out in
the first Sonine approximation, in which the evolution of the temperature is
coupled to that of the excess kurtosis. This coupling leads to the emergence of
the Mpemba effect, which is observed in an early stage of the relaxation and
when the initial temperatures of the two samples are close enough. This allows
for the development of a simple theory, linearizing the temperature evolution
around a reference temperature---namely the initial temperature closer to the

stronger magneto-optical couplings, a promising approach is to utilize
nonlinear optical processes. Here, we demonstrate nonreciprocal magnetoelectric
second harmonic generation (SHG) in CuB2O4. SHG transmission changes by almost
100% in a magnetic-field reversal of just 10 mT. The observed nonreciprocity
results from an interference between the magnetic-dipole- and
electric-dipole-type SHG. Even though the former is usually notoriously smaller
than the latter, it is found that a resonantly enhanced
magnetic-dipole-transition has a comparable amplitude as non-resonant
electric-dipole-transition, leading to the near-perfect nonreciprocity. This
mechanism could form one of the fundamental bases of nonreciprocity in
multiferroics, which is transferable to a plethora of magnetoelectric systems
to realize future nonreciprocal and nonlinear-optical devices.

framework provides a way to evaluate mutual information between latent codes

codes like CORSIKA and the radio plug-in CoREAS use various averaged

atmospheric models are needed for the cosmic ray analysis method used for LOFAR
data. There, dedicated simulation sets are used for each detected cosmic ray,
to take into account the actual atmospheric conditions at the time of the
measurement. Using the Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS), a global
atmospheric model, we have implemented time-dependent, realistic atmospheric
profiles in CORSIKA and CoREAS. We have produced realistic event-specific
atmospheres for all air showers measured with LOFAR, an event set spanning
several years and many different weather conditions. A complete re-analysis of
our data set shows that for the majority of data, our previous correction
factor performed rather well; we found only a small systematic shift of 2
g/cm$^2$ in the reconstructed $X_{\rm max}$. However, under extreme weather
conditions, for example, very low air pressure, the shift can be up to 15
g/cm$^2$. We provide a correction formula to determine the shift in $X_{\rm

expensive. Once the model is created, its use in the intended application - the
inference task, is computationally heavy too and the inference needs to be fast
for real time use. For obtaining high performance today, the code of Deep
Learning (DL) primitives optimized for specific architectures by expert
programmers exposed via libraries is the norm. However, given the constant
emergence of new DNN architectures, creating hand optimized code is expensive,
slow and is not scalable.
  To address this performance-productivity challenge, in this paper we present
compiler algorithms to automatically generate high performance implementations
of DL primitives that closely match the performance of hand optimized
libraries. We develop novel data reuse analysis algorithms using the polyhedral
model to derive efficient execution schedules automatically. In addition,
because most DL primitives use some variant of matrix multiplication at their
core, we develop a flexible framework where it is possible to plug in library
implementations of the same in lieu of a subset of the loops. We show that such
a hybrid compiler plus a minimal library-use approach results in
state-of-the-art performance. We develop compiler algorithms to also perform
operator fusions that reduce data movement through the memory hierarchy of the
computer system.

style embeddings outperforms the baseline methods for image similarity such as
SIFT, SURF, and various image hashing methods. We first evaluate the
performance of the proposed method on two well-known datasets for evaluating
image similarity methods and show that content, style, and combined embeddings
increase precision@k and recall@k by 10%-15% and 12%-25%, respectively when
retrieving five nearest neighbours. Second, specifically for the app
counterfeit detection problem, combined content and style embeddings achieve
12% and 14% increase in precision@k and recall@k, respectively compared to the
baseline methods. Third, we present an analysis of approximately 1.2 million
apps from Google Play Store and identify a set of potential counterfeits for
top-10,000 popular apps. Under a conservative assumption, we were able to find
2,040 potential counterfeits that contain malware in a set of 49,608 apps that
showed high similarity to one of the top-10,000 popular apps in Google Play

of techniques reveals that efficient techniques not only reduce the size of the

also shows that compression of a DNA sequence is significant for understanding
the critical characteristics of DNA data in addition to improving storage

brings enormous improvements in network throughput, coverage and energy
efficiency in densely populated areas. Unlike previous IEEE 802.11 standards
where power saving mechanisms have a limited capability and flexibility,
802.11ax comes with a different mechanism called Target Wake Time (TWT) where
stations (STAs) wake up only after each TWT interval and different STAs can
wake up at different time instance depending on their application requirements.
As an example, for a periodic data arrival occurring in IoT applications, STA
can wake up by following the data period and go to sleep mode for a much longer
time, and STAs with high traffic volume can have shorter TWT interval to wake
up more frequency. Moreover, as multi-user transmission capability is added to
802.11ax, multiple STAs can have the same TWT interval and wake up at the same
time, and hence there is a great opportunity to have collision-free
transmission by scheduling multiple STAs on appreciate TWT intervals to reduce
energy consumption and also increase network throughput. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of STAs scheduling and TWT interval assignment together
to reduce overall energy consumption of the network. We propose an algorithm
that dynamically selects STAs to be served and assigns them the most suitable
TWT interval given their traffic and channel conditions. We analyze our
algorithm through Lyapunov optimization framework and show that our algorithm
is arbitrarily close to the optimal performance at the price of increased queue
sizes. Simulation results show that our algorithm consumes less power and
support higher traffic compared to a benchmark algorithm that operates randomly

use efficient transmission paths within contact graphs. This enables the
pathogen to maximise infection rates and spread within a target population. In
this work, we devise techniques to localise infections and decrease infection
rates based on a principled analysis of disease transmission paths within
human-contact networks (proximity graphs). Experimental results of disease
spreading shows that that at low visibility rates contact tracing slows disease
spreading. However to stop disease spreading, contact tracing requires both
significant visibility (at least 60%) into the proximity graph and the ability
to place half of the population under isolation. We find that pro-actively
isolating super-links -- key proximity encounters -- has significant benefits:
targeted isolation of a fourth of the population based on 35% visibility into
the proximity graph prevents an epidemic outbreak. It turns out that isolating
super-spreaders is more effective than contact tracing and testing but less
effective than targeting super-links. We highlight the important role of
topology in epidemic outbreaks. We argue that proactive innoculation of a
population by disabling super-links and super-spreaders may have an important
complimentary role alongside contact tracing and testing as part of a
sophisticated public-health response to epidemic outbreaks.

introduce a new meta-score assessment named Elo-based Predictive Power (EPP)

three multilingual recurrent neural network (RNN) models: a classifier trained
on the joint vocabularies of all training languages; a Siamese RNN trained to
discriminate between same and different words from multiple languages; and a
correspondence autoencoder (CAE) RNN trained to reconstruct word pairs. In a
word discrimination task on six target languages, all of these models
outperform state-of-the-art unsupervised models trained on the zero-resource

precision. When using only a few training languages, the multilingual CAE
performs better, but with more training languages the other multilingual models
perform similarly. Using more training languages is generally beneficial, but
improvements are marginal on some languages. We present probing experiments
which show that the CAE encodes more phonetic, word duration, language identity

involve decision making akin to a computer game. AI gaming algorithms such as
Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) gained prominence after their exemplary
performance in the computer Go game and are decision trees aimed at identifying
the path (moves) that should be taken by the policy to reach the final winning
or optimal solution. Major challenges in inverse sequencing problems are that
the materials search space is extremely vast and property evaluation for each
sequence is computationally demanding. Reaching an optimal solution by
minimizing the total number of evaluations in a given design cycle is therefore
highly desirable. We demonstrate that one can adopt this approach for solving
the sequencing problem by developing and growing a decision tree, where each
node in the tree is a candidate sequence whose fitness is directly evaluated by
molecular simulations. We interface MCTS with MD simulations and use a
representative example of designing a copolymer compatibilizer, where the goal
is to identify sequence specific copolymers that lead to zero interfacial
energy between two immiscible homopolymers. We apply the MCTS algorithm to
polymer chain lengths varying from 10-mer to 30-mer, wherein the overall search
space varies from 210 (1024) to 230 (~1 billion). In each case, we identify a
target sequence that leads to zero interfacial energy within a few hundred
evaluations demonstrating the scalability and efficiency of MCTS in exploring
practical materials design problems with exceedingly vast chemical/material
search space. Our MCTS-MD framework can be easily extended to several other
polymer and protein inverse design problems, in particular, for cases where
sequence-property data is either unavailable and/or is resource intensive.

A stochastic geometry framework has been used to extract the results. First,
cellular and D2D users are modeled by independent homogeneous Poisson point
process; then, exact expressions for successful transmission probability of D2D
and cellular users have been derived. Furthermore, the average sum rate and
energy efficiency for a typical D2D scenario have been presented. An
optimization problem subject to transmission power and quality of service
constraints for both cellular and D2D users has been defined and energy
efficiency of D2D communication is maximized. Simulation results reveal that by
working in millimeter-wave, significant energy efficiency improvement can be
attained, e.g., 20\% energy efficiency improvement compared to Rayleigh

to verify our analytical expressions, the simulation studies are carried out
and the excellent agreements have been achieved.

  Online Optimization Perspective",,,,,"cs.IR cs.AI cs.LG","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  To maximize cumulative user engagement (e.g. cumulative clicks) in sequential
recommendation, it is often needed to tradeoff two potentially conflicting
objectives, that is, pursuing higher immediate user engagement (e.g.,
click-through rate) and encouraging user browsing (i.e., more items exposured).
Existing works often study these two tasks separately, thus tend to result in
sub-optimal results. In this paper, we study this problem from an online
optimization perspective, and propose a flexible and practical framework to
explicitly tradeoff longer user browsing length and high immediate user
engagement. Specifically, by considering items as actions, user's requests as
states and user leaving as an absorbing state, we formulate each user's
behavior as a personalized Markov decision process (MDP), and the problem of
maximizing cumulative user engagement is reduced to a stochastic shortest path
(SSP) problem. Meanwhile, with immediate user engagement and quit probability
estimation, it is shown that the SSP problem can be efficiently solved via
dynamic programming. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approach. Moreover, this approach is deployed at
a large E-commerce platform, achieved over 7% improvement of cumulative clicks.

answers to user-generated questions in massive collections of documents. There
are two families of solutions available: retriever-readers, and
knowledge-graph-based approaches. A retriever-reader usually first uses
information retrieval methods like TF-IDF to locate some documents or
paragraphs that are likely to be relevant to the question, and then feeds the
retrieved text to a neural network reader to extract the answer. Alternatively,
knowledge graphs can be constructed from the corpus and be queried against to
answer user questions. We propose a novel algorithm with a reader-retriever
structure that differs from both families. Our reader-retriever first uses an
offline reader to read the corpus and generate collections of all answerable
questions associated with their answers, and then uses an online retriever to
respond to user queries by searching the pre-constructed question spaces for
answers that are most likely to be asked in the given way. We further combine
retriever-reader and reader-retriever results into one single answer by
examining the consistency between the two components. We claim that our
algorithm solves some bottlenecks in existing work, and demonstrate that it
achieves superior accuracy on real-world datasets.

  by Knowledge Graph",,,,,"cs.CL cs.CR","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Most of the existing text generative steganographic methods are based on
coding the conditional probability distribution of each word during the
generation process, and then selecting specific words according to the secret
information, so as to achieve information hiding. Such methods have their
limitations which may bring potential security risks. Firstly, with the
increase of embedding rate, these models will choose words with lower
conditional probability, which will reduce the quality of the generated
steganographic texts; secondly, they can not control the semantic expression of
the final generated steganographic text. This paper proposes a new text
generative steganography method which is quietly different from the existing
models. We use a Knowledge Graph (KG) to guide the generation of steganographic
sentences. On the one hand, we hide the secret information by coding the path
in the knowledge graph, but not the conditional probability of each generated
word; on the other hand, we can control the semantic expression of the
generated steganographic text to a certain extent. The experimental results
show that the proposed model can guarantee both the quality of the generated
text and its semantic expression, which is a supplement and improvement to the
current text generation steganography.

  Transformers in the realm of subjectivity","80 pages, Master's thesis in Computer Science (CS)",,,,"cs.CL","http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","  Understanding subjectivity demands reasoning skills beyond the realm of
common knowledge. It requires a machine learning model to process sentiment and
to perform opinion mining. In this work, I've exploited a recently released
dataset for span-selection Question Answering, namely SubjQA. SubjQA is the
first QA dataset that contains questions that ask for subjective opinions
corresponding to review paragraphs from six different domains. Hence, to answer
these subjective questions, a learner must extract opinions and process
sentiment for various domains, and additionally, align the knowledge extracted
from a paragraph with the natural language utterances in the corresponding
question, which together enhance the difficulty of a QA task. The primary goal
of this thesis was to investigate the inner workings (i.e., latent
representations) of a Transformer-based architecture to contribute to a better
understanding of these not yet well understood ""black-box"" models.
Transformer's hidden representations, concerning the true answer span, are
clustered more closely in vector space than those representations corresponding
to erroneous predictions. This observation holds across the top three
Transformer layers for both objective and subjective questions and generally
increases as a function of layer dimensions. Moreover, the probability to
achieve a high cosine similarity among hidden representations in latent space
concerning the true answer span tokens is significantly higher for correct
compared to incorrect answer span predictions. These results have decisive
implications for down-stream applications, where it is crucial to know about
why a neural network made mistakes, and in which point, in space and time the
mistake has happened (e.g., to automatically predict correctness of an answer
span prediction without the necessity of labeled data).

Americans and creates an enormous strain on the health care system. This paper
proposes a machine learning predictive model for AD development without medical
imaging and with fewer clinical visits and tests, in hopes of earlier and
cheaper diagnoses. That earlier diagnoses could be critical in the
effectiveness of any drug or medical treatment to cure this disease. Our model
is trained and validated using demographic, biomarker and cognitive test data
from two prominent research studies: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) and Australian Imaging, Biomarker Lifestyle Flagship Study of
Aging (AIBL). We systematically explore different machine learning models,
pre-processing methods and feature selection techniques. The most performant
model demonstrates greater than 90% accuracy and recall in predicting AD, and
the results generalize across sub-studies of ADNI and to the independent AIBL
study. We also demonstrate that these results are robust to reducing the number
of clinical visits or tests per visit. Using a metaclassification algorithm and
longitudinal data analysis we are able to produce a ""lean"" diagnostic protocol
with only 3 tests and 4 clinical visits that can predict Alzheimer's
development with 87% accuracy and 79% recall. This novel work can be adapted
into a practical early diagnostic tool for predicting the development of
Alzheimer's that maximizes accuracy while minimizing the number of necessary
diagnostic tests and clinical visits.

monitoring, and climate modeling. Current sea ice models, however, predict more
ice than is observed in the Arctic, and less in the Antarctic. Improving the
fit of these physics-based models to observations is challenging because the
models are expensive to run, and therefore expensive to optimize. Here, we
construct a machine learning surrogate that emulates the effect of changing
model physics on forecasts of sea ice area from the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model
(CICE). We use the surrogate model to investigate the sensitivity of CICE to
changes in the parameters governing: ice's ridging and albedo; snow's albedo,
aging, and thermal conductivity; the effect of meltwater on albedo; and the
effect of ponds on albedo. We find that CICE's sensitivity to these model
parameters differs between hemispheres. We propose that future sea ice modelers
separate the snow conductivity and snow grain size distributions on a seasonal
and inter-hemispheric basis, and we recommend optimal values of these
parameters. This will make it possible to make models that fit observations of
both Arctic and Antarctic sea ice more closely. These results demonstrate that
important aspects of the behavior of a leading sea ice model can be captured by
a relatively simple support vector regression surrogate model, and that this
surrogate dramatically increases the ease of tuning the full simulation.

solve dynamic partial differential equations (PDEs). Different from standard
GANs, the training term is no longer the true data and the generated data, but
rather their residuals. In addition, such theories as governing equations,
other physical constraints and engineering controls, are encoded into the loss
function of the generator to ensure that the prediction does not only honor the
training data, but also obey these theories. TgGAN is proposed for dynamic
subsurface flow with heterogeneous model parameters, and the data at each time
step are treated as a two-dimensional image. In this study, several numerical
cases are introduced to test the performance of the TgGAN. Predicting the
future response, label-free learning and learning from noisy data can be
realized easily by the TgGAN model. The effects of the number of training data
